well I would like to take my roll as an admin to contribute well on Wikibooks rather than on current status ,cause I believe I can actively participate in most of times and help to get rid unnecessary posts,prevent vandalism,make better posts as much as I can.
if any of authorities bureaucrat can grant me the administrative permission I could happily accept that.
And Thanks.

it doesn't matter the time I have joined with the Wikibooks ,the important thing is what can you do really and how much can you really participate.
infact there are no special requirements to be an admin if you know the rules and regulations that's what it needs right.?
there is no point to keep thousand of inactive people only enough have 1 active member.
I intend to post better articles about what I know later ,and I saw most of times I should wait till someone accept my post
that's so disturbing but if I can be an admin I can freely post what I want without waiting.
now look at Obama, he was a newbie to the president post but not for the politics right.?&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Faulknerck2|Faulknerck2]] ([[User talk:Faulknerck2|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Faulknerck2|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:In your first sentence: &quot;well I would like to take my roll as an admin to contribute well on Wikibooks rather than on current status ,cause I believe I can actively participate in most of times and help to get rid unnecessary posts,prevent vandalism,make better posts as much as I can.&quot; Item: capital letter in the first word of the sentence. Item: the word &quot;roll&quot; is misused. You are not looking for a small, round piece of bread, you are looking for a role. Questionable: &quot;on Wikibooks&quot; rather than &quot;to Wikibooks&quot;. Item: &quot;rather than on current status&quot;: on is not the correct preposition here, and you do not identify what &quot;current status&quot; refers to, you would best express this as &quot;rather than with my current status&quot;.  Item: &quot;cause&quot; misused word. Item: &quot;in most of times&quot; awkward and incorrect construction. Item: &quot;get rid unnecessary posts&quot; missing &quot;of&quot;.

I'm the most blocked Wikibookian on the project, so trust me when I say that you are exceeding what even I see as tolerable disruption and behavior, especially since it is all unnecessary and pointless I attribute it not to bad intentions, since we have been able to collaborate but to lack of experience and a misconception that Wikibooks is like other Wikimedia projects. I hope you take this as a friendly warning to realize that things can be done in another way and you should stay within conventions.

::::::::Kayau you seem to have missed the point of what Adrignola was attempting to convey to Faulknerck2. Put Adrignola post into context with the actions and requests of the user. CVU can be argued from different points of views, the core issue is that it is a declaration of intention, it relates well with the barnstar discussion, it has been argued that some user may require that type of recognition or feeling to be in a particular and special job, in fact the text at CVU could be more expressive, since any user belonging or not to the group, if performing the actions that relates to that group, will indeed have a leg up on community recognition for work done. It is not a requirement but serves as a demonstration of participation in the improvement of the project what Arlen22 refers as a 'special elite group of people', you just have to understand it in this specific context.
::::::::Special, because they are actively working on a task. Elite group, because they demonstrate an understanding of the project as to perform the function.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The evilwm package provides a minimalistic lightweight stacking window manager for the X windowing system.

== Features ==

Features of the evilwm window manager include:

* Stacking windows
* Written in C
* Provides a simple 1 pixel wide border for window decorations
* No titlebars
* No rootmenu
* No deskbars
* No panels
* Raise windows using the mouse or keyboard
* Resize windows using the mouse or keyboard
* Windows may be maximized
* No facility to hide or minimize windows
* No task display methods
* Program launching is limited to opening a terminal or another command
* Follow focus with no autoraise
* Up to 8 multiple desktops
* Desktop switching via the keyboard
* No desktop shortcuts
* No wallpaper
* No shared frames
* No tabbed windows
* No theme support
* Colours can be configured via the command line
* Uses the xrender library
* Lighweight (rated as 1 on the hammer scale)

== Operation ==

=== Launching an application ===

In evilwm, applications are launched via the terminal. A terminal session is launched from the keyboard, by pressing Ctrl + Alt + Enter.
Alternatively, the terminal can be set to a launcher or something else with the -term [command] switch.

=== Raising and lowering windows ===

Applications can be switched using Alt + Tab. An application window can be dropped towards the back by pressing Alt + Rightclick within the application window. Pressing Alt + Leftclick on a window or clicking on its border will bring it to the front.

=== Resizing windows ===

Resizing of window can be achieved by using Alt + Middleclick or pressing Ctrl + Alt + Shift + H,J,K,L (note that not all keyboards will be able to detect more than three keys).

=== Moving windows ===

Windows can be moved by pressing Alt and dragging the window with Left click, dragging the window border, or with Ctrl + Alt + H,J,K,L.

=== Controls ===

==== General Controls ====

* Alt + Tab - Switch currently raised application
* Ctrl + Alt + Enter - Launch a terminal session
* Ctrl + Alt + Left - Switch to the previous desktop (for multiple desktops)
* Ctrl + Alt + Right - Switch to the next desktop (for multiple desktops)
* Ctrl + Alt + A - Switch to previous desktop (for multiple desktops)

==== Controls within a client window ====

Client window controls apply to the window in focus.

* Alt + Button 1 - Move Window
* Alt + Button 2 - Resize Window
* Alt + Button 3 - Drop window to background
* Ctrl + Alt + Esc - Close application window
* Ctrl + Alt + Insert - Drop window to background
* Ctrl + Alt + I - Show information about current window
* Ctrl + Alt + X - Maximize (and restore)
* Shift + Ctrl + Alt + Esc - Kill application

==== Window motion controls ====

Window motion controls apply to the window in focus.

* Ctrl + Alt + H - Move window left
* Ctrl + Alt + J - Move window down
* Ctrl + Alt + K - Move window up
* Ctrl + Alt + L - Move window right
* Ctrl + Alt + Y - Move window to the top left of screen
* Ctrl + Alt + U - Move window to the top right of screen
* Ctrl + Alt + B - Move window to the bottom left of screen
* Ctrl + Alt + N - Move window to the botton right of screen

====  Controls for moving windows between desktops ====

The controls for moving windows between desktops apply to the window in focus.

* Ctrl + Alt + F - Fix/unfix current window (so it appears on all desktops)
* Ctrl + Alt + 1-8 - Move to desktop 1-8 (fixed windows will move along with it)

== Dependencies ==

evilwm is dependent on the following xlib libraries:

* [[xrender]]

== Where is evilwm on the hammer scale? ==

| 1 | Pin hammer | A minimalist tool designed to do a specific job.

== Review ==

The evilwm window manager is extremely lightweight and rated as a pinhammer on the hammer scale.

The evilwm window manager is awkward to use because it requires the use of both the keyboard and the mouse for operation and windows do not become raised when they are clicked on.

The window manager makes extensive use of keys, and a new user will probably need a list of keys at the terminal. There is no desktop context events, and an operator needs to know how to launch a terminal session. The window manager has a good set of keyboard controls and the keymappings have been well thought out, but the keys are not configurable.

The evilwm window manager is not accessibility friendly because it does not provide keyboard equivalents for some of its operations and is not touchscreen friendly because it requires a multibutton mouse.

In this section we will begin to make use of the definitions we made in the section about binary operations. In the next few sections, we will study a specific type of binary structure called a ''group''. First, however, we need some preliminary work involving a less restrictive type of binary structure.

==Monoids==

'''Definition 1:''' A ''monoid'' is a binary structure &lt;math&gt;(M,*)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the following properties:

:(i) &lt;math&gt;(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in M&lt;/math&gt;.

:(ii) There exists an element &lt;math&gt;e\in M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a*e=a=e*a&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in M&lt;/math&gt;.

The element &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; in (ii) is called an identity element of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.


Now we have our axioms in place, we are faced with a pressing question; what is our first theorem going to be? Since the first few theorems are not dependent on one another, we simply have to make an arbitrary choice. We choose the following:


'''Theorem 2:''' The identity element of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is unique.

''Proof'': Assume &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^\prime&lt;/math&gt; are both identity elements of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. Then both satisfy condition (ii) in the definition above. In particular, &lt;math&gt;e=e*e^\prime = e^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


This theorem will turn out to be of fundamental importance later when we define groups.


'''Theorem 3:''' If &lt;math&gt;a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n&lt;/math&gt; are elements of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;n\in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, then the product &lt;math&gt;a_1*a_2*\cdots*a_n&lt;/math&gt; is unambiguous.

''Proof'': We can prove this by induction. The cases for &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; are trivially true. Then, assume that the statement is true for all &lt;math&gt;k\leq n-1&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the product &lt;math&gt;a_1*\cdots*a_n&lt;/math&gt;, inserting parentheses, can be &quot;partitioned&quot; into &lt;math&gt;(a_1*\cdots*a_i)*(a_{i+1}*\cdots*a_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, since &lt;math&gt;1\leq i \leq n-1&lt;/math&gt;, both parts of the product have a number of elements less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and are thus unambiguous. We compute these products and are left with &lt;math&gt;(b_1)*(b_2)=b_1*b_2&lt;/math&gt; which is unambiguous, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}

This is about as far as we are going to take the idea of a monoid. We now proceed to groups.

==Groups==

'''Definition 4:''' A ''group'' is a monoid &lt;math&gt;(G,*)&lt;/math&gt; that also satisfies the property
:(iii) For each &lt;math&gt;a\in G&lt;/math&gt;, there exists and element &lt;math&gt;a^\prime \in G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a*a^\prime = a^\prime *a=e&lt;/math&gt;.


Such an element &lt;math&gt;a^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is called an inverse of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. When the operation on the group is understood, we will conveniently refer to &lt;math&gt;(G,*)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, we will gradually stop using the symbol &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; for multiplication when we are dealing with only one group, or when it is understood which operation is meant, instead writing products by juxtaposition, &lt;math&gt;a*b\equiv ab&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Remark 5:''' Notice how this definition depends on Theorem 2 to be well defined. Therefore we could not state this definition before at least proving uniqueness of the identity element. Alternatively, we could have included the existence of a distinguished identity element in the definition. In the end, the two approaches are logically equivalent.


'''Theorem 6:''' The inverse of any element is unique.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;g^\prime&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g^{\prime\prime}&lt;/math&gt; be inverses of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;g^\prime = g^\prime *e = g^\prime * g * g^{\prime \prime} = e*g^{\prime \prime} = g^{\prime \prime}&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}

Thus, we can speak of ''the'' inverse of an element, and we will denote this element by &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. We also observe this nice property:


'''Corollary 7:''' &lt;math&gt;(a^{-1})^{-1}=a&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': This follows immediately since &lt;math&gt;a*a^{-1}=a^{-1}*a=e&lt;/math&gt;.

The next couple of theorems may appear obvious, but in the interest of keeping matters fairly rigorous, we allow ourselves to state and prove seemingly trivial statements.

'''Theorem 8:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;a,b\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;(a*b)^{-1}=b^{-1}*a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': The result follows by direct computation: &lt;math&gt;(a*b)*(b^{-1}*a^{-1})=a*b*b^{-1}*a^{-1}=a*e*a^{-1}=a*a^{-1}=e&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 9:''' Let &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;a*b=a*c&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;b=c&lt;/math&gt;. Also, &lt;math&gt;a*c=b*c&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a=b&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': We will prove the first assertion. The second is identical. Assume &lt;math&gt;a*b=a*c&lt;/math&gt;. Then, multiply on the left and right by &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to obtain &lt;math&gt;b=c&lt;/math&gt;. Secondly, assume &lt;math&gt;b=c&lt;/math&gt;. Then, multiply on the left by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to obtain &lt;math&gt;a*b=a*c&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 10:''' The equation &lt;math&gt;a*x=b&lt;/math&gt; has a unique solution in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;a,b\in G&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': We must show existence and uniqueness. For existence, observe that &lt;math&gt;g=a^{-1}*b&lt;/math&gt; is a solution in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. For uniqueness, multiply both sides of the equation on the left by &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to show that this is the only solution. {{Unicode|∎}}


''Notation:'' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;a\in G&lt;/math&gt;. We will often encounter a situation where we have a product &lt;math&gt;\underbrace{a*a*\cdots*a}_{\mathrm{n\,terms}}&lt;/math&gt;. For these situations, we introduce the shorthand notation &lt;math&gt;a^n=\underbrace{a*a*\cdots*a}_{\mathrm{n\,terms}}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is positive, and &lt;math&gt;a^n=\underbrace{a^{-1}*a^{-1}*\cdots*a^{-1}}_{\mathrm{|n|\,terms}}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is negative. Under these rules, it is straightforward to show &lt;math&gt;g^n*g^m=g^{n+m}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(a^n)^{-1}=a^{-n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a^0=e&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in G&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Definition 11:''' (i) The ''order'' of a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;|G|&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;o(G)&lt;/math&gt;, is the number of elements of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is finite, and &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.

(ii) The order of an element of &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;, similarly denoted &lt;math&gt;|g|&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;o(g)&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as the lowest positive integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g^n=e&lt;/math&gt; if such an integer exists, and &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.


'''Theorem 12:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;a,b\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;|ab|=|ba|&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Let the order of &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;(ab)^n=abab...ab=e&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; being the smallest positive integer such that this is true. Now, multiply by &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; on the left and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; on the right to obtain &lt;math&gt;(ba)^{n+1}=ba&lt;/math&gt; implying &lt;math&gt;(ba)^n=e&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, we have shown that &lt;math&gt;|ba|\leq |ab|&lt;/math&gt;. A similar argument in the other direction shows that &lt;math&gt;|ab|\leq |ba|&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, we must have &lt;math&gt;|ab|=|ba|&lt;/math&gt;, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Corollary 13:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group with &lt;math&gt;a,b\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;|aba^{-1}|=|b|&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': By Theorem 7, we have that &lt;math&gt;|aba^{-1}|=|ba^{-1}a|=|be|=|b|&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 14:''' An element of a group not equal to the identity has order 2 if and only if it is its own inverse.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; have order 2 in the group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;g^2=gg=e&lt;/math&gt;, so by definition, &lt;math&gt;g^{-1}=g&lt;/math&gt;. Now, assume &lt;math&gt;g^{-1}=g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\neq e&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;e=gg^{-1}=gg=g^2&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;g\neq e&lt;/math&gt;, 2 is the smallest positive integer satisfying this property, so &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; has order 2. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Definition 15:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group such that for all &lt;math&gt;a,b\in G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;ab=ba&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''commutative'' or ''abelian''.

When we are dealing with an abelian group, we will sometimes use so-called additive notation, writing &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; for our binary operation and replacing &lt;math&gt;a^n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;na&lt;/math&gt;. In such cases, we only need to keep track of the fact that &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is an integer while &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a group element. We will also talk about the ''sum'' of elements rather than their product.

Abelian groups are in many ways nicer objects than general groups. They also admit more structure where ordinary groups do not. We will see more about this later when we talk about structure-preserving maps between groups.


'''Definition 16:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group. A subset &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''generating set'' for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; if every element in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; can be written in terms of elements in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.


Now that we have our definitions in place and have a small arsenal of theorems, let us look at three (really, two and a half) important families of groups.

== Multiplication tables ==

We will now show a convenient way of representing a group structure, or more precisely, the multiplication rule on a set. This notion will not be limited to groups only, but can be used for any structure with any number of operations. As an example, we give the group multiplication table for the ''Klein 4-group'' &lt;math&gt;K_4&lt;/math&gt;. The multiplication table is structured such that &lt;math&gt;g*h&lt;/math&gt; is represented by the element in the &quot;&lt;math&gt;(g,h)&lt;/math&gt;-position&quot;, that is, in the intersection of the &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;-row and the &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;-column.


:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c|cccc} * &amp; e &amp; a &amp; b &amp; c \\ \hline e &amp; e &amp; a &amp; b &amp; c \\ a &amp; a &amp; e &amp; c &amp; b \\ b &amp; b &amp; c &amp; e &amp; a \\ c &amp; c &amp; b &amp; a &amp; e \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;


This next group is for the group of integers under addition modulo 4, called &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_4&lt;/math&gt;. We will learn more about this group later.


:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c|cccc} + &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ \hline 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 \\ 2 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 3 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;


We can clearly see that &lt;math&gt;K_4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_4&lt;/math&gt; are &quot;different&quot; groups. There is no way to relabel the elements such that the multiplication tables coincide. There is a notion of &quot;equality&quot; of groups that we have not yet made precise. We will get back to this in the section about group homomorphisms.


The reader might have noticed that each row in the group table features each element of the group exactly once. Indeed, assume that an element &lt;math&gt;k\in G&lt;/math&gt; appeared twice in some row of the multiplication table for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then there would exist &lt;math&gt;g,h,h^\prime\in G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;gh=gh^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, implying &lt;math&gt;h=h^\prime&lt;/math&gt; and contradicting the assumption of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; appearing twice. We state this as a theorem:


'''Theorem 17:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;a\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;aG=\{a*g\mid g\in G\}=G&lt;/math&gt;.


Using this, the reader can use a multiplication table to find all groups of order 3. He/she will find that there is only one possibility.

== Problems ==

'''Problem 1:''' Show that &lt;math&gt;M_n(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;, the set of &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrices with real entries, forms a group under the operation of matrix addition.


'''Problem 2:''' Let &lt;math&gt;V,W&lt;/math&gt; be vector spaces and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}(V,W)&lt;/math&gt; be the set of linear maps from &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;. Show that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}(V,W)&lt;/math&gt; forms an abelian group by defining &lt;math&gt;(f+g)(v)=f(v)+g(v)&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Problem 3:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt; be generated by the elements &lt;math&gt;i,j,k,m&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;i^2=j^2=k^2=m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m^2=e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ij=mji=k&lt;/math&gt;. Show that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt; forms a group. This group is called the group of ''quaternions'', and is a 4-dimensional version of the complex numbers. Are any of the conditions above redundant?


'''Problem 4:''' Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be any nonempty set and consider the set &lt;math&gt;G^S&lt;/math&gt;. Show that &lt;math&gt;G^S&lt;/math&gt; has a natural group structure.
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text= &lt;math&gt;G^S&lt;/math&gt; is the set of functions &lt;math&gt;f\,:\, S\rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Problem 5:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group with two distinct elements &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, both of order 2. Show that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has a third element of order 2.
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=We consider first the case where &lt;math&gt;ab=ba&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;ab\neq ba&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(aba^{-1})^2=abaa^{-1}ba^{-1}=abba^{-1}=e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;aba^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is distinct from &lt;math&gt;e,a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}}}


'''Problem 6:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group with one and only one element &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of order 2. Show that &lt;math&gt;\prod_{g\in G} g = f&lt;/math&gt;.
{{HideNseek|title=Answer|text=Since the product of two elements generally depends on the order in which we multiply them, the stated product is not neccesarily well defined. However, it works out in this case.

Since every element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; appears once in the product, for every element &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;, the inverse of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; must appear somewhere in the product. That, is, unless &lt;math&gt;|g|=2&lt;/math&gt; in which case &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is its own inverse by Theorem 14. Now, applying Corollary 13 to the product shows that its order is that same as the order of the product of all elements of order 2 in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. But there is only one such element, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, so the order of the product is 2. Since the only element in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; having order 2 is &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, the equality follows. {{Unicode|∎}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Subgroups ==

We are about to witness a universal aspect of mathematics. That is, whenever we have any sort of structure, we ask ourselves: does it admit substructures? In the case of groups, the answer is yes, as we will immediately see.

'''Definition 1:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group. Then, if &lt;math&gt;H\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; which is a group in its own right under the same operation as &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, we call &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; a ''subgroup'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and write &lt;math&gt;H\leq G&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Example 2:''' Any group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has at least 2 subgroups; &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; itself and the trivial group &lt;math&gt;\{e\}&lt;/math&gt;. These are called the ''improper'' and ''trivial'' subgroups of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.


Naturally, we would like to have a method of determining whether a given subset of a group is a subgroup. The following two theorems provide this. Since &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; naturally inherits the associativity property from &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, we only need to check closure.

'''Theorem 3:''' A subset &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; of a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup if and only if

:(i) &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is closed under the operation on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. That is, if &lt;math&gt;a,b\in H&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;ab\in H&lt;/math&gt;,

:(ii) &lt;math&gt;e\in H&lt;/math&gt;,

:(iii) &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is closed under the taking of inverses. That is, if &lt;math&gt;a\in H&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': The left implication follows directly from the group axioms and the definition of subgroup. For the right implication, we have to verify each group axiom for &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. Firstly, since &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is closed, it is a binary structure, as required, and as mentioned, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; inherits associativity from G. In addition, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; has the identity element and inverses, so &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a group, and we are done. {{Unicode|∎}}

There is, however, a more effective method. Each of the three criteria listed above can be condensed into a single one.


'''Theorem 4:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group. Then a nonempty subset &lt;math&gt;H\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup if and only if &lt;math&gt;a,b\in H \,\Rightarrow \, ab^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Again, the left implication is immediate. For the right implication, we have to verify the (i)-(iii) in the previous theorem. First, assume &lt;math&gt;a\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Then, letting &lt;math&gt;b=a&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain &lt;math&gt;aa^{-1}=e\in H&lt;/math&gt;, taking care of (ii). Now, since &lt;math&gt;e,a\in H&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;ea^{-1}=a^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is closed under taking of inverses, satisfying (iii). Lastly, assume &lt;math&gt;a,b\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Then, since &lt;math&gt;b^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain &lt;math&gt;a(b^{-1})^{-1}=ab\in H&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is closed under the operation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying (i), and we are done. {{Unicode|∎}}

All right, so now we know how to recognize a subgroup when we are presented with one. Let's take a look at how to find subgroups of a given group. The next theorem essentially solves this problem.


'''Theorem 5:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Then the subset &lt;math&gt;\{g^n\mid n\in \mathbb{Z}\}&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\langle g \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and called the ''subgroup generated by &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;''. In addition, this is the ''smallest'' subgroup containing &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; in the sense that if &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup and &lt;math&gt;g\in H&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\langle g \rangle \leq H&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': First we prove that &lt;math&gt;\langle g \rangle&lt;/math&gt; ''is'' a subgroup. To see this, note that if &lt;math&gt;h,k\in \langle g \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists integers &lt;math&gt;n,m\in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;h=g^n\,,\,k=g^m&lt;/math&gt;. Then, we observe that &lt;math&gt;hk^{-1}=g^ng^{-m}=g^{n-m}\in\langle g \rangle&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;n-m\in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\langle g \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, as claimed. To show that it is the smallest subgroup containing &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, observe that if &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup containing &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, then by closure under products and inverses, &lt;math&gt;g^n\in H&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n\in Z&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt;\langle g\rangle\subseteq H&lt;/math&gt;. Then automatically &lt;math&gt;\langle g \rangle \leq H&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\langle g \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 6:''' Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be subgroups of a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;H\cap H^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is also a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Since both &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H^\prime&lt;/math&gt; contain the identity element, their intersection is nonempty. Let &lt;math&gt;a,b\in H\cap H^\prime&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;a,b\in H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a,b\in H^\prime&lt;/math&gt;. Since both &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H^\prime&lt;/math&gt; are subgroups, we have &lt;math&gt;ab^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ab^{-1}\in H^\prime&lt;/math&gt;. But then &lt;math&gt;ab^{-1}\in H\cap H^\prime&lt;/math&gt; (why?). Thus &lt;math&gt;H\cap H^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}

Theorem 6 can easily be generalized to apply for any arbitrary intesection &lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{i\in I} H_i&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;H_i&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup for every &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in an arbitrary index set &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. The reasoning is identical, and the proof of this generalization is left to the reader to formalize.


'''Definition 7:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;gH=\{gh\mid h\in H\}&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''left coset'' of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. The set of all left cosets of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt;. Likewise, &lt;math&gt;Hg=\{hg\mid h\in H\}&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''right coset'', and the set of all right cosets of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;H\backslash G&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Lemma 8:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then every left coset has the same number of elements.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; and define the function &lt;math&gt;f\,:\, H \rightarrow gH&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;h\mapsto gh&lt;/math&gt;. We show that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection. Firstly, &lt;math&gt;gh=gh^\prime \,\Rightarrow\, h=h^\prime&lt;/math&gt; by left cancellation, so &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is injective. Secondly, let &lt;math&gt;h^\prime\in gH&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;h^\prime = gh&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;h\in H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(h)=h^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is surjective and a bijection. It follows that &lt;math&gt;|H|=|gH|&lt;/math&gt;, as was to be shown. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Lemma 9:''' The relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;a\sim b \,\Leftrightarrow \, a^{-1}b\in H&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation.

''Proof'': Reflexivity and symmetry are immediate. For transitivity, let &lt;math&gt;a\sim b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b\sim c&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}b,b^{-1}c\in H&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}c\in H&lt;/math&gt; and we are done. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Lemma 10:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then the left cosets of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; partition &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Note that &lt;math&gt;aH=bH \Leftrightarrow ah=bh^\prime\,\Leftrightarrow a^{-1}bh^\prime=h \,\Leftrightarrow a^{-1}b\in H&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;h,h^\prime\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;a\sim b \,\Leftrightarrow \, a^{-1}b\in H&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation and the equivalence classes are the left cosets of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, these automatically partition &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 11 (Lagrange's theorem):''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a finite group and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;|G|=|G/H||H|&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': By the previous lemmas, each left coset has the same number of elements &lt;math&gt;|H|&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; is included in a unique left coset &lt;math&gt;gH&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is partitioned by &lt;math&gt;|G/H|&lt;/math&gt; left cosets, each contributing an equal number of elements &lt;math&gt;|H|&lt;/math&gt;. The theorem follows. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Note 12:''' Each of the previous theorems have analagous versions for right cosets, the proofs of which use identical reasoning. Stating these theorems and writing out their proofs are left as an exercise to the reader. 


'''Corollary 13:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then right and left cosets of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; have the same number of elements.

''Proof'': Since &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a left and a right coset we immediately have &lt;math&gt;|gH|=|H|=|Hg^\prime|&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g,g^\prime\in G&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Corollary 14:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then the number of left cosets of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and the number of right cosets of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are equal.

''Proof'': By Lagrange's theorem and its right coset counterpart, we have &lt;math&gt;|H||H\backslash G|=|G|=|G/H||H|&lt;/math&gt;. We immediately obtain &lt;math&gt;|H\backslash G|=|G/H|&lt;/math&gt;, as was to be shown. {{Unicode|∎}}


Now that we have developed a reasonable body of theory, let us look at our first important family of groups, namely the cyclic groups.

== Problems ==

'''Problem 1 (Matrix groups):''' Show that:

:i) The group &lt;math&gt;GL(n,\mathbb{R})=\{A\in M_n(\mathbb{R})\mid \det(A)\neq 0\}&lt;/math&gt; of invertible &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrices is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;M_n(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;. This group is called the ''general linear group of order'' &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

:ii) The group &lt;math&gt;O(n)=\{A\in M_n(\mathbb{R})\mid AA^T=I\}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; orthogonal matrices is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;GL(N,\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;. This group is called the ''orthogonal group of order ''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

:iii) The group &lt;math&gt;SO(n)=\{A\in M_n(\mathbb{R})\mid AA^T=I\,\wedge\, \det(A)=1\}&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt;. This group is called the ''special orthogonal group of roder ''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

:iv) The group &lt;math&gt;U(n)=\{A\in M_n(\mathbb{C})\mid AA^*=I\}&lt;/math&gt; of unitary matrices is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;GL(n,\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt;. This is called the ''unitary group of order ''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

:v) The group &lt;math&gt;SU(n)=\{A\in M_n(\mathbb{C})\mid AA^*=I\,\wedge\, \det(A)=1\}&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;U(n)&lt;/math&gt;. This is called the ''special unitary group of order ''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Problem 2:''' Show that if &lt;math&gt;H,K&lt;/math&gt; are subgroups of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;H\cup K&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;H\subseteq K&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;K\subseteq H&lt;/math&gt;.

'''George Washington''' (1732-1799) was America’s first President.  Before becoming President, he was a soldier, serving as a colonel in the [[US History/Road to Revolution#The French and Indian War|French and Indian War]] and as the leader of the Continental Army during the [[US History/American Revolution|American Revolution]] against [[wikipedia:England|England]].  He was also head of the [[Wikijunior:United States Charters of Freedom/Constitution|Constitutional Convention]], when the United States wrote the basic laws that govern our country.  He is called the “Father of Our Country” because without him, many believe that the United States would not have existed, at least as we know it.

==What did he do when he was young?==
George Washington was born on February 22, 1732, near what is now Colonial Beach, Virginia.  As a child, some people thought he chopped down a cherry tree, though this is probably not true.  Washington's family owned a lot of land in Virginia.  Washington was raised in Fredericksburg, Virginia.  Washington did not receive a formal education. In 1747, he became a surveyor, someone who measures lands.

==What did he do to be famous?==
===Farmer===
By his 20s, Washington was one of the largest landowners in Virginia.  By the time of the Presidency, Washington was the largest landowner in America. 

===French and Indian War===

===American Revolution===

===Constitutional Convention===
Washington was President of the Constitutional Convention in 1787.

Hello!

I will be delivering a Talk at the Wikimedia Conference India 2011 on the topic of &quot;Accelerating Wikibooks&quot;.

Over the next few days, I aim to make the proposal more and more wholesome and relevant. I'd like to discuss with you about the proposal and hope you can recommend me a few names on Wikibooks with whom I can discuss this.

I'd be very happy if you could discuss the proposal at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Thewinster/Accelerating_Wikibooks

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following is a list of very well-known Americans, organized by how they contributed to the United States.

==Statesmen==
The following people all held high public office in the government of the United States, especially President.
===U.S. Presidents===
[[Image:Gilbert Stuart Williamstown Portrait of George Washington.jpg|50px|right|George Washington]]
*'''[[Wikijunior:Famous Americans/George Washington|George Washington]]''' (1732-1799) was America’s first President.  Before becoming President, he was a soldier, serving as a colonel in the [[US History/Road to Revolution#The French and Indian War|French and Indian War]] and as the leader of the Continental Army during the [[US History/American Revolution|American Revolution]].  He was also head of the [[Wikijunior:United States Charters of Freedom/Constitution|Constitutional Convention]], when the United States wrote the basic laws that govern our country.  He is called the “Father of Our Country” because without him, many believe that the United States would not have existed, at least as we know it.{{-}}

[[Image:Abraham Lincoln head on shoulders photo portrait.jpg|50px|right|Abraham Lincoln]]
*'''[[Wikijunior:Famous Americans/Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln]]''' (1809-1865) was President of the United States during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], during which he tried to save the Union.  He is known as the “Great Emancipator” because he issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which eventually freed millions of slaves.  He is also known for being born in a [[log cabin]] and giving a speech called the [[Gettysburg Address]].  He was the first President to be assassinated (shot and killed).{{-}}

[[Image:Thomas_Jefferson_by_Rembrandt_Peale,_1800.jpg|50px|right|Thomas Jefferson]]
*'''[[Thomas Jefferson]]''' (1743-1826) was President of the United States from 1801-1809.  During his presidency, the United States purchased a large area of land known as the [[Louisiana Purchase]].  Before he was President, he wrote most of the [[Declaration of Independence]].  He is also known for being a political thinker, founding the [[University of Virginia]], and for bringing several [[wikt:innovation|innovations]] to America.{{-}}

[[Image:President Theodore Roosevelt, 1904.jpg|50px|right|Theodore Roosevelt]]
*'''[[Theodore Roosevelt]]''' (1858-1919) was President from 1901-1909.  Before being President, he fought in the [[Spanish-American War]] and was Governor of New York.  He advocated a strong foreign policy known as the “[[Big Stick]]”, started building the [[Panama Canal]], and broke up several monopolies (companies that control all of an industry).  Thanks to his presidency, the United States became one of the most powerful countries in the world.{{-}}

[[Image:FDR in 1933.jpg|50px|right|FDR]]
*'''[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]''' (1882-1945) was President from 1933-1945. He took office during the [[Great Depression]], a period when a quarter of the country had no jobs.   He responded by creating a series of programs known as the [[New Deal]], which created jobs and started federal welfare (giving money to people who don’t have much).  He was also President during the [[World War II|Second World War]].  He suffered from a disease called [[polio]] and could not use his legs very well.{{-}}

[[Image:Jamesmadison.jpg|50px|right|James Madison]]
*'''[[James Madison]]''' (1751-1836) was President from 1809-1817, during the [[War of 1812]].  He is known as the “Father of the Constitution” because many of the basic laws that govern our country were his idea.  He wrote some of ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', which convinced people that the Constitution was a good idea.{{-}}

[[Image:John F. Kennedy, White House photo portrait, looking up.jpg|50px|right|JFK]]
*'''[[John F. Kennedy]]''' (1917-1963) was President from 1961-1963.  He was popular among many Americans because he looked like a movie star.  Kennedy was President during the [[Cold War]], which was a struggle between the US and the Soviet Union to see who was more powerful.  He was assassinated, meaning that somebody shot him and he died.  He had brothers, [[Robert Kennedy]] and [[Ted Kennedy]], who were also in politics.{{-}}

[[Image:Barack Obama.jpg|50px|right|Barack Obama]]
*'''[[Barack Obama]]''' (born 1961) is the current President of the United States and the first [[African-American]] President.  Before being President, he gave a famous speech in 2004 and served as a Senator.  He was elected President because many Americans thought he could bring hope and change to America.  As President, he is having to deal with the worst economy since the Great Depression.{{-}}

===Other Statesmen===
[[Image:BenFranklinDuplessis.jpg|right|50px|Ben Franklin]]
*'''[[Benjamin Franklin]]''' (1706-1790) was active in the movement to achieve independence from England.  He helped write the [[Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Articles of Confederation]] (the laws that the United States had before the Constitution).  He lived much of his life in [[Philadelphia]], but also went to [[England]] and [[France]] to represent America.  Besides being a politician, he is credited with inventing the lightning rod and founded several institutions, including the first public library in the United States.  He was a printer and an author of a yearly book called Poor Richard’s Almanack.{{-}}

[[Image:Alexander Hamilton portrait by John Trumbull 1806.jpg|right|50px|Alexander Hamilton]]
*'''[[Alexander Hamilton]]''' (1755-1804) was active in the American government at its founding.  He helped get the Constitution [[:wikt:ratify|ratified]], meaning he found support for it among the American people.  He is credited for establishing American monetary policy, which is the way the United States and its government deal with money.  He wanted the United States government to be very, very powerful, perhaps even more powerful than it is today.{{-}}

[[Image:Marshall-john-engraving-after-inman-harvard-legal.png|right|50px|John Marshall]]
*'''[[John Marshall]]''' (1755-1835) was the [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice of the Supreme Court]] from 1801-1835.  He started judicial review, meaning that the Supreme Court could undo a law if they thought it didn’t fit with the [[U.S. Constitution]].  Many of his rulings influence what the U.S. government is able to do to this day.{{-}}

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Henry Clay.JPG|50px|Henry Clay]][[Image:Daniel Webster 1.jpg|50px|Daniel Webster]]&lt;/div&gt;
*'''[[Henry Clay]]''' (1777-1852, ''near right'') and '''[[Daniel Webster]]''' (1782-1852, ''far right'') both served as Congressmen, Senators and [[Secretary of State|Secretaries of State]] (the person who is in charge of dealing with how the U.S. relates to other countries) during the early and mid-19th century.  Though neither was elected President, both are thought to be two of America’s greatest statesmen.  Clay was known as the “Great Compromiser” because he made agreements that stopped [[American Civil War|states from leaving the Union]] until after his death.  Webster was a great speaker and argued many important cases before the Supreme Court.{{-}}

==Generals==
The following people served as high-ranking officers in the U.S. Army.

He is responsible for several victories, such as Vicksburg and Petersburg, that helped the North win the war.  He eventually was in charge of all Union armies and forced the surrender of [[Robert E. Lee]].  He became President in 1869, but wasn’t very good.
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower 1947.jpg|50px|right|Dwight Eisenhower]]
*'''[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]''' (1890-1969) was a general in [[World War II]].  He was placed in charge of all the [[Allied]] forces in Europe.  He organized the troops that invaded Normandy on [[D-Day]] and won the war in Europe.  After the war, he was in charge of all the troops in NATO (a group of countries including the U.S., Canada, and most of Europe) and became President.
[[Image:Robert Edward Lee.jpg|50px|right|Robert E. Lee]]
&lt;br&gt;
*'''[[Robert E. Lee]]''' (1807-1870) was an officer in the U.S. Army who left to become a general in the Confederacy (the South, the states that were trying to leave the U.S.).  Despite not having as many men, he won many battles because he was very smart.  He eventually lost to Grant.
&lt;br&gt;

*'''[[Martin Luther King Jr.]]''' (1929-1968) was a [[Baptist]] minister and a leader in the fight for equality for African-Americans in the 1950s and 1960s.  Before King, the South had a policy of discrimination, meaning blacks and whites in many areas had to go to different schools, sit in different places on the bus, and even use different drinking fountains.  King led non-violent protests that led to laws that ended discrimination.  In 1963, he led a [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] and gave the “I Have a Dream” speech.{{-}}

[[Image:Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.jpg|50px|right|Anthony &amp; Stanton]]
*'''[[Susan B. Anthony]]''' (1820-1906, ''standing'') and '''[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]]''' (1815-1902, ''sitting'') were leaders of the women’s suffrage movement, meaning that they fought for women’s right to vote (before 1920, women could not vote in elections for President).  In 1848, Stanton organized the Seneca Falls Convention, which was a meeting of people who thought women should get rights equal to men.  In 1872, Anthony attempted to vote for President to call attention to the fact that women were not allowed to vote.{{-}}

[[Image:Frederick Douglass portrait.jpg|50px|right|Frederick Douglass]]
*'''[[Frederick Douglass]]''' (1818-1895) was an African-American and a leader in the Abolitionist movement, meaning that he wanted to end slavery.  Douglass was born a slave, but escaped from slavery.  He gave many speeches and wrote a newspaper and a book, ''Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass''.  He encouraged thousands of blacks to join the Union Army during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  After the Civil War, he was the U.S.’ man in [[Haiti]].{{-}}

[[Image:Harriet Tubman cropped.jpg|50px|right|Harriet Tubman]]

She was a spy during the Civil War.  After the Civil War, she was active in fighting for women to have the right to vote.{{-}}

[[Image:Rosaparks.jpg|50 px|right|Rosa Parks]]
*'''[[Rosa Parks]]''' (1913-2005) was an African-American and a leader in the Civil Rights movement.  She was told by a white man to give up her seat on a bus in Birmingham, Alabama, but refused.  This led to a boycott by blacks of Birmingham buses and ultimately to anti-discrimination laws.  She was a symbol of the Civil Rights Movement. {{-}}

[[Image:Eleanor Roosevelt portrait 1933.jpg|50px|right|Eleanor Roosevelt]]
*'''[[Eleanor Roosevelt]]''' (1884-1962) was the wife of Franklin D. Roosevelt.  During his term as President, she was one of the most active First Ladies ever, interacting with many everyday citizens.  After FDR died, she was a delegate to the brand-new [[United Nations]], where she helped write and pass the [[:en:Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Declaration of Human Rights]] (a statement of rights that everybody everywhere should have).  This earned her the nickname “First Lady of the World.”{{-}}

[[Image:Cesar chavez crop.jpg|right|50px|Cesar Chavez]]

[[Image:Thomas Edison.jpg|50px|right|Thomas Edison]]
*'''[[Thomas Edison]]''' (1847-1931) is most famous for inventing the first practical [[light bulb]] in 1879.

*The '''[[Wright Bros]]''', '''Orville''' (1871-1948, ''near right'') and '''Wilbur''' (1867-1912, ''far right''), are credited with the first practical, sustained, controlled, powered flight, which was at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903.

      <comment>/* Automorphism Groups */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}
We are finally making our way into the meat of the theory. In this section we will study ''structure-preserving maps'' between groups. This study will open new doors and provide us with a multitude of new theorems.


Up until now we have studied groups at the &quot;element level&quot;. Since we are now about to take a step back and study groups at the &quot;homomorphism level&quot;, readers should expect a sudden increase in abstraction starting from this section. We will try to ease the reader into this increase by keeping one foot at the &quot;element level&quot; throughout this section.


From here on out the notation &lt;math&gt;e_G&lt;/math&gt; will denote the identity element in the group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; unless otherwise specified.

== Group homomorphisms ==

'''Definition 1:''' Let &lt;math&gt;(G,*)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(H,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; be groups. A ''homomorphism'' from &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a function &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;g_1,g_2\in G&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(g_1*g_2)=\phi(g_1)\cdot\phi(g_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, a homomorphism ''preserves the group structure''. We have included the multiplication symbols here to make explicit that multiplication on the left hand side occurs in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and multiplication on the right hand side occurs in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.


Already we see that this section is different from the previous ones. Up until now we have, excluding subgroups, only dealt with one group at a time. No more! Let us start by deriving some elementary and immediate consequences of the definition.


'''Theorem 2:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G,H&lt;/math&gt; be groups and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; a homomorphism. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi(e_G)=e_H&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the identity is mapped to the identity.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;\phi(g)=\phi(e_Gg)=\phi(e_G)\phi(g)&lt;/math&gt;, implying that &lt;math&gt;\phi(e_G)&lt;/math&gt; is the identity in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 3:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G,H&lt;/math&gt; be groups and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; a homomorphism. Then for any &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi(g^{-1})=\phi(g)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, inverses are mapped to inverses.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;e_H=\phi(e_G)=\phi(gg^{-1})=\phi(g)\phi(g^{-1})&lt;/math&gt; implying that &lt;math&gt;\phi(g^{-1})=\phi(g)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, as was to be shown. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 4:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G,G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be groups, &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\,G\rightarrow G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; a homomorphism and let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi(H)=\{\phi(h)\mid h\in H\}&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;h_1,h_2\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi(h_1),\phi(h_2)\in \phi(H)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi(h_1)\phi(h_2)^{-1}=\phi(h_1)\phi(h_2^{-1})=\phi(h_1h_2^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;h_1h_2^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi(h_1)\phi(h_2)^{-1}=\phi(h_1h_2^{-1})\in \phi(H)&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;\phi(H)&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 5:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G,G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be groups, &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\,G\rightarrow G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; a homomorphism and let &lt;math&gt;H^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; be a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}(H^\prime)=\{g\in G\mid \phi(g)\in H^\prime\}&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;g_1,g_2\in \phi^{-1}(H^\prime)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi(g_1),\phi(g_2)\in H^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, and since &lt;math&gt;H^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup, &lt;math&gt;\phi(g_1)\phi(g_2)^{-1}=\phi(g_1)\phi(g_2^{-1})=\phi(g_1g_2^{-1})\in H^\prime&lt;/math&gt;. But then, &lt;math&gt;g_1g_2^{-1}\in \phi^{-1}(H^\prime)&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}(H^\prime)&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


From Theorem 4 and Theorem 5 we see that homomorphisms ''preserve subgroups''. Thus we can expect to learn a lot about the subgroup structure of a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; by finding suitable homomorphisms into &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.


In particular, every homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; has associated with it two important subgroups.


'''Definition 6:''' A homomoprhism is called an ''isomorphism'' if it is bijective and its inverse is a homomorphism. Two groups are called ''isomorphic'' if there exists an isomorphism between them, and we write &lt;math&gt;G\approx H&lt;/math&gt; to denote &quot;&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.


'''Theorem 7:''' A bijective homomorphism is an isomorphism.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;G,H&lt;/math&gt; be groups and let &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\,G\rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; be a bijective homomorphism. We must show that the inverse &lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism. Let &lt;math&gt;h_1,h_2\in H&lt;/math&gt;. then there exist unique &lt;math&gt;g_1,g_2\in G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi(g_1)=h_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi(g_2)=h_2&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have &lt;math&gt;\phi(g_1g_2)=h_1h_2&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism. Now apply &lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to all equations. We obtain &lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}(h_1)=g_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}(h_2)=g_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}(h_1h_2)=g_1g_2=\phi^{-1}(h_1)\phi^{-1}(h_2)&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism and thus &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Definition 8:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G,G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be groups. A homomorphism that maps every element in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;e^\prime\in G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''trvial homomorphism'' (or ''zero homomorphism''), and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;0_{GG^\prime}\,:\, G\rightarrow G^\prime&lt;/math&gt;


'''Definition 9:''' Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a subgroup of a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then the homomorphism &lt;math&gt;i\,:\, H\rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;i(h)=h&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''inclusion'' of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be a group isomorphic to a subgroup &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; of a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then the isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G^\prime\rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; induces an injective homomorphism &lt;math&gt;i^\prime\,:\, G^\prime\rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;i^\prime(g^\prime)=\phi(g^\prime)&lt;/math&gt;, called an ''imbedding'' of &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Obviously, &lt;math&gt;i^\prime=i\circ\phi&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Definition 10:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G,G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be groups and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; a homomorphism. Then we define the following subgroups:

:i) &lt;math&gt;\ker\,\phi = \{g\in G\mid \phi(g)=e^\prime\}\leq G&lt;/math&gt;, called the ''kernel'' of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, and

:ii) &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}\,\phi = \{g^\prime\in G^\prime\mid (\exists g\in G) \phi(g)=g^\prime\}\leq G^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, called the ''image'' of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Theorem 11:''' The composition of homomorphisms is a homomorphism.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;G,H,K&lt;/math&gt; be groups and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\,G\rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,:\, H\rightarrow K&lt;/math&gt; homomorphisms. Then &lt;math&gt;\psi\circ\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow K&lt;/math&gt; is a ''function''. We must show it is a homomorphism. Let &lt;math&gt;g,h\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\psi\circ\phi(gh)=\psi(\phi(gh))=\psi(\phi(g)\phi(h))=\psi(\phi(g))\psi(\phi(h))=\psi\circ\phi(g)\psi\circ\phi(h)&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\psi\circ\phi&lt;/math&gt; is indeed a homomorphisms. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 12:''' Composition of homomorphisms is associative.

''Proof'': This is evident since homomorphisms are ''functions'', and composition of functions is associative. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Corollary 13:''' The composition of isomorphisms is an isomorphism.

''Proof'': This is evident from Theorem 11 and since the composition of bijections is a bijection. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 14:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G,H&lt;/math&gt; be groups and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\,G\rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; a homomorphism. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is injective if and only if &lt;math&gt;\ker\,\phi = \{e\}\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Assume &lt;math&gt;\ker\,\phi=\{e\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_1,g_2\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi(g_1)=\phi(g_2)\,\Leftrightarrow \phi(g_1)\phi(g_2)^{-1}=\phi(g_1g_2^{-1})=e_H&lt;/math&gt;, implying that &lt;math&gt;g_1g_2^{-1}\in\ker\,\phi&lt;/math&gt;. But by assumption then &lt;math&gt;g_1g_2^{-1}=e\,\Leftrightarrow g_1=g_2&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is injective. Assume now that &lt;math&gt;\ker\,\phi\neq\{e\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists another element &lt;math&gt;k\in\ker\,\phi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;k\neq e&lt;/math&gt;. But then &lt;math&gt;\phi(g)=\phi(kg)&lt;/math&gt;. Since both &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;kg\neq g&lt;/math&gt; map to &lt;math&gt;\phi(g)=\phi(kg)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is not injective, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Corollary 15:''' Inclusions are injective.

''Proof'': The result is immediate. Since &lt;math&gt;i(h)=h&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;h\in H\leq G&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;i^{-1}(e)=\{e\}&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


The kernel can be seen to satisfy a universal property. The following theorem explains this, but it is unusually abstract for an elementary treatment of groups, and the reader should not worry if he/she cannot understand it immediately.


[[File:Diagramkernel.png|thumb|Commutative diagram showing the universal property of kernels.]]
'''Theorem 16:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G,G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be groups and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; a group homomorphism. Also let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,:\, H\rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt; a homomorphism such that &lt;math&gt;\phi\circ\psi=0_{HG^\prime}&lt;/math&gt;. Also let &lt;math&gt;i\,:\,\ker\,\phi\rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt; is the inclusion of &lt;math&gt;\ker\,\phi&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists a unique homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\bar{\psi}\,:\, H\rightarrow \ker\,\phi&lt;/math&gt; such that&lt;math&gt;\psi=i\circ \bar{\psi}&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Since &lt;math&gt;\phi\circ\psi=0_{HG^\prime}&lt;/math&gt;, by definition we must have &lt;math&gt;\psi(H)\leq\ker\,\phi&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\bar{\psi}&lt;/math&gt; exists. The commutativity &lt;math&gt;\psi=i\circ\bar{\psi}&lt;/math&gt; then forces &lt;math&gt;\bar{\psi}(h)=\psi(h)\in\ker\,\phi&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\bar{\psi}&lt;/math&gt; is unique. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Definition 17:''' A ''commutative diagram'' is a pictorial presentation of a network of functions. Commutativity means that when several routes of function composition from one object lead to the same destination, the two compositions are equal as functions. As an example, the commutative diagram on the right describes the situation in Theorem 16. In the commutative diagrams (or diagrams for short, we will not show diagrams which no not commute) shown in this chapter on groups, all functions are implicitly assumed to be group homomorphisms. Monomorphisms in diagrams are often emphasized by hooked arrows. In addition, epimorphims are often emphasized by double headed arrows. That an inclusion is a monomorphism will be proven shortly.


'''Remark 18:''' From the commutative diagram on the right, the kernel can be ''defined'' completely without reference to elements. Indeed, Theorem 16 would become the definition, and our Definition 10 i) would become a ''theorem''. We will not entertain this line of thought in this book, but the advanced reader is welcome to work it out for him./herself.

== Automorphism Groups ==

In this subsection we will take a look at the homomorphisms from a group to itself.


'''Definition 19:''' A homomorphism from a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to itself is called an ''endomorphism of ''&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. An endomorphism which is also an isomorphism is called an ''automorphism''. The set of all endomorphisms of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{End}(G)&lt;/math&gt;, while the set of all automorphisms of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Aut}(G)&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Theorem 20:''' &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{End}(G)&lt;/math&gt; is a monoid under composition of homomorphisms. Also, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Aut}(G)&lt;/math&gt; is a submonoid which is also a group.

''Proof'': We only have to confirm that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{End}(G)&lt;/math&gt; is closed and has an identity, which we know is true. For &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Aut}(G)&lt;/math&gt;, the identity homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{id}_G\,:\,G\rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism and the composition of isomorphisms is an isomorphism. Thus &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Aut}(G)&lt;/math&gt; is a submonoid. To show it is a group, note that the inverse of an automorphism is an automorphism, so &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Aut}(G)&lt;/math&gt; is indeed a group. {{Unicode|∎}}

== Groups with Operators ==


An endomorphism of a group can be thought of as a ''unary operator'' on that group. This motivates the following definition:


'''Definition 21:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;\Omega\subset\mathrm{End}(G)&lt;/math&gt;. Then the pair &lt;math&gt;(G,\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''group with operators''. &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''operator domain'' and its elements are called the ''homotheties'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. For any &lt;math&gt;\omega\in\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, we introduce the shorthand &lt;math&gt;\omega(g)=g^\omega&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the fact that the homotheties of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are endomorphisms can be expressed thus: for all &lt;math&gt;a,b\in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega\in\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(ab)^\omega=a^\omega b^\omega&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Example 22:''' For any group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, the pair &lt;math&gt;(G,\emptyset)&lt;/math&gt; is trivially a group with operators.


'''Lemma 23:''' Let &lt;math&gt;(G,\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; be a group with operators. Then &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; can be extended to a submonoid &lt;math&gt;\Omega^\prime&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{End}(G)&lt;/math&gt; such that the structure of &lt;math&gt;(G,\Omega^\prime)&lt;/math&gt; is identical to &lt;math&gt;(G,\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega^\prime&lt;/math&gt; include the identity endomorphism and let &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be a generating set. Then &lt;math&gt;\Omega^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is closed under compositions and is a monoid. Since any element of &lt;math&gt;\Omega^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is expressible as a (possibly empty) composition of elements in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, the structures are identical. {{Unicode|∎}}


In the following, we assume that the operator domain is always a monoid. If it is not, we can extend it to one by Lemma 23.


'''Definition 24:''' Let &lt;math&gt;(G,\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(H,\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; be groups with operators with the same operator domain. Then a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\,(G,\Omega)\rightarrow (H,\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; is a group homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;\omega\in\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\phi(g^\omega)=\phi(g)^\omega&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Definition 25:''' Let &lt;math&gt;(G,\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; be a group with operators and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''stable subgroup'' (or a &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;-invariant subgroup) if for all &lt;math&gt;h\in H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega\in\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h^\omega\in H&lt;/math&gt;. We say that &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; ''respects the homotheties'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. In this case &lt;math&gt;(H,\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; is a ''sub-group with operators''.


'''Example 26:''' Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a vector space over the field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. If we by &lt;math&gt;V_+&lt;/math&gt; denote the underlying abelian group under addition, then &lt;math&gt;V=(V_+,F)&lt;/math&gt; is a group with operators, where for any &lt;math&gt;k\in F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v\in V_+&lt;/math&gt;, we define &lt;math&gt;v^k=kv&lt;/math&gt;. Then the stable subgroups are precisely the linear subspaces of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; (show this).

== Problems ==

'''Problem 1:''' Show that there is no nontrivial homomorphism from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_5&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When functions were introduced in this chapter they were described as a special kind of relation.  A relation is simply a connection between one number and some others.  On the other hand a function has just one connection between a number an another number.  For instance absolute value is a function because the absolute value of any number will map onto one, and only one number.  On the other hand the square root operation is a relationship.  &lt;math&gt; \sqrt x^2 &lt;/math&gt; can be true for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-x &lt;/math&gt;.  

We defined the identity value for addition as 0 and for multiplication as 1.  This is because adding zero to a number does not change that number, or multiplying a number by 1 does not change that number.  We defined the inverse of addition as subtraction.  This is because a - a =0.  The inverse of multiplication is division (except for 0) since a / a = 1.  We define the inverse of a function as the function g such that g(f(x)) = x.  

For example the inverse of the squared function is the square function for whole numbers.  That is for zero and non-negative rational numbers the &lt;math&gt; \sqrt x^2 = x&lt;/math&gt;.  This is not true for the real numbers.  For real numbers &lt;math&gt; \sqrt x^2 = x\ or -x&lt;/math&gt;.

When explaining the definition of domain and range of a relation we defined the vertical line test as stating that on a Cartesian plane if we let the x axis indicate the domain of a function and the y axis indicate the domain than the relationship is a function if the graph is not intersected more than once by a vertical line at every point on the graph. The vertical line test is an informal way to see if a relationship is a function.  We can also use it to determine if the function has an inverse.  For instance if we let &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt; we can see from its graph that it is a function.  On the other hand if we graph &lt;math&gt;y=\sqrt x&lt;/math&gt; we can see that a vertical line will cross the graph twice for every value except 0.

== About this Book ==

This book is for anyone interested in playing the accordion but has little to no prior knowledge about it. It features some background into the history of the instrument, how it works, and most importantly, an instructional guide aimed at getting you to playing at a simple to intermediate level.

If you are planning to seriously study the instrument, we recommend you find yourself a professional accordion teacher; no textbook can wholly replace the first-hand knowledge of a live, real performer. However, this book is useful as an initial supplement to just get you started.

'''N.B.''' The book is still a work in progress and currently only deals with the piano accordion, not button models (although they may be covered at a later date).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Accordion (PSF).png|thumb|right|220px|How to hold the accordion standing up.]]

Since your left arm is moving horizontally and vertically, and your right hand is moving vertically, body position is very important. The main goal is to be comfortable yet exercise as much control as possible over the motions of the instrument. Some players prefer sitting, while others like to stand (although this can be easily tiring, especially with a big instrument).

When playing the accordion, the shoulder straps should be fairly tight so that the instrument doesn't shift around as you reach for notes. Don't slouch - it looks ugly and causes you to lose control. Your left arm should be between the bellow-strap and the board; tighten that strap (usually via a notch on top of the bellows mechanism, very rarely Velcro might be used) so that it won't cut off your arm circulation, but not so loose that your hand slips as you change directions with the bellows.

Resist the temptation to bend your right wrist and play with your elbow close to the side of your body. Instead, try to hold your entire arm, from the elbow to the wrist, more or less parallel with the keyboard. Though this may seem awkward at first, in the long run it will help you achieve better accuracy because the circulation to your hand is unimpeded. Note that none of this applies to the left arm.

If playing standing up, stand with good posture and adjust the shoulder straps so that the bottom of the accordion is more or less parallel with the floor and the back of the keyboard portion is against your chest. This will help keep it from shifting too much while you play.

If playing seated, adjust the straps so that the instrument rests lightly on your left leg but doesn't hang loosely from your body. The bottom of the keyboard should be between the legs, and not moved too far to one side. You might need to move your right leg out of the way a little bit so the right hand can reach the bottom keys on the accordion unimpeded. Sit up straight in your chair - don't lean backwards against the back of the chair or slump; it looks bad and can results in poorer accuracy.

You might want to consider investing in a ''backstrap'', a small hook-and-eye device that connects the two shoulder straps from behind when you're wearing the instrument. It's useful for bigger instruments because it stops the straps from slipping off your shoulders.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Melodiebass.jpg|200px|thumb|Three systems]]

The '''free-bass''' is a type of keyboard system that is found on some accordions. Unlike the Stradella-bass system, all of the buttons on a free-bass keyboard play single notes, not chords. The free-bass also has a bigger range of notes than the Stradella system, and it is easier to play out a tune with it. Due to this, the free bass system is used more often to play serious classical music with less transcription involved.

Most bass systems can switch between the Stradella and free-bass systems, while some accordions have free-bass only or auxiliary free-bass rows in addition to the Stradella buttons (sometimes called a ''bassetti'').

There are two common free-bass systems: one is the ''chromatic free bass'', where the notes move in a chromatic pattern upwards or downwards (see chart at right). The other is the ''quint bass'' system, which has a note system similar to the Stradella bass layout, but spread over several octaves. The former system gives you around five octaves of range in the left hand, and the latter about three. Usually, only big and expensive accordions have free-bass and it is still a relatively new concept; chances are the instrument you have, or are looking to buy, does not have it. As a beginning accordionist, you should not be too worried about it.

The study of free bass is currently beyond the scope of this module, although it may be covered at a later date. Knowing the free-bass system is not essential to becoming a professional accordionist; many pieces can be played just as well on the Stradella system, although free bass is useful for complex pieces like piano music or three/four voice counterpoint (which can frequently be played note-for-note without any transcription even necessary).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many accordions have a reputation for being manufactured exceedingly well, and with proper maintenance and preventative measures, it can last decades. Aside from the cost of repairs, you might have difficulty finding someone skilled enough to repair the instrument! A little bit of care goes a long way.

*When lifting up and putting down your accordion, always be careful; hold the instrument with both hands (by the straps, if they are sturdy). Dropping an accordion even from a small height can be disastrous. When transporting the instrument, it is advisable to lock the bellows straps on the top and bottom (usually found on all but the oldest accordions) so the bellows don't come out. Be careful not to push in the bass buttons when carrying your accordion; it can damage the bass mechanisms.

*Always store your accordion in a case if you can. This helps keep it away from humidity and other things that might damage the instrument. Try to keep it out of too much heat, cold, or humidity. The reeds inside the accordion might bend out of tune if there's too much humidity.

[[Image:Accordion.jpg|right|300px|thumb|How to store the accordion properly on a table.]]
*If you can't store the accordion in a case, then '''always place it on a hard flat surface''' (like a table), with the keyboard facing up perpendicular to the floor. (The bass side of the instrument usually little protrusions at the corners so you and put it down safely.) Make sure to '''always''' store it the right way up. An accordion is constructed with leather flaps (valves) that seal the back pressure from the reed that is not sounding in the current direction of bellows movement. Storing the instrument upright allows the valves to be preserved. Storing in other orientations will cause one set of valves to be bent under gravity, ruining the tone and needing more early refurbishment.

*'''Avoid extreme temperatures.''' If you would be uncomfortable in the room, so would your accordion. Parts of your accordion are held together by wax or glue joints that can melt in heat. Don't leave the instrument near a ventilator, heater, or near a sunny window, and especially don't leave it in the trunk of a car, because the temperature is uncontrollable and unstable. Also, the accordion may suffer from jolts while in the trunk, especially if not stored the correct way up.

*If you've just taken the accordion in from from the cold, take it out of its case and let it &quot;warm up&quot; before playing for at least half an hour. Moisture may collect on the reeds from the sudden temperature change, and you want to give it time to dissipate or else the water might harm the reeds.

* '''Avoid moisture.''' Do not play your accordion in the rain, or take it to the beach. The salty air can cause the reeds to rust rapidly.

* '''Don't store in an attic or basement.''' Be aware that older accordions found in attics may contain harmful mould in the bellows. When played, the mould is propelled towards the player's face.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:96_button_Stradella_bass_upload_(physical).jpg|thumb|right|250px|A 96-button Stradella bass layout on an accordion]]
The '''Stradella bass system''' (also called the ''standard bass'' sometimes) is a type of button layout you find on the left (or bass) side of almost all accordions. It uses columns of buttons arranged in a circle of fifths.

Each diagonal column has, in order from the innermost to outermost buttons:
* The major third above (or minor sixth below, depending on which note) the root (&quot;counter-bass&quot;)
* The root note
* The root note's major chord
* The root note's minor chord
* The root note's dominant seventh chord
* The root note's diminished seventh chord

Small accordions sometimes lack some of these rows, but for the purposes of this guide, we'll assume you have the full complement of buttons.

This is a chart of how a standard, 120-button bass layout will look like:

[[File:120-button Stradella chart.svg|center|750px]]

'''Tip:''' ''Consider printing out this chart and referring to it as you continue with this guide. You might find it helpful to have a visual representation of the directions described.''

The middle &quot;C&quot; usually has a bump or hole in it for you to feel, to make it easier to find your way around the left buttons without looking at them. The A flat and E will also have some sort of marking sometimes.

Horizontal columns are arranged in a different order: every column goes up a fifth as you move up the bass board. So a &quot;G&quot; would be below middle &quot;C&quot;, and a &quot;F&quot; would be above the middle &quot;C&quot;, a &quot;D&quot; would be above the &quot;G&quot;, and so on.

Most full-size accordion basses have either 120, or, less commonly, 96 buttons. All notes in an octave are covered by both systems, so you can play in any key.

When playing with the bass buttons, you use all fingers but your thumb, which should stay on the board on the side of the accordion.

Most accordions also have an ''air button'' on the side of the instrument that doesn't play any notes, but instead lets air in and out of the instrument.

If you have a large enough instrument, chances are there will be one or more switches next to the innermost row of buttons (near to the bellows). By pressing these, you can control which reeds in the left hand manual are sounding to create different timbres appropriate for the music you're playing, similar to the switches on the right hand.

In the next few pages, we'll learn the basics of playing either a simple accompaniment or melody on the basses. Just use the navigation below to go backward or forward.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Accordion right hand timbre switches.jpg|thumb|right|195px|A few right-hand manual register switches on a piano accordion. This one has three different voices.]]

A '''reed rank''' inside an accordion is a full set of the reeds that are used to make different timbres. These reed ranks are located in the reed chamber. Most accordions usually have two to four reed blocks in the treble and four or five in the left.

They can be used by themselves or in different combinations to make different sounds by allowing or shutting off the flow of air to certain ranks. These combinations are sometimes classified by the instruments they imitate, for instance the clarinet, oboe, and bassoon stops.

The reed ranks can be changed by pressing buttons usually found on the side of the accordion. A full-sized instrument usually will also have a &quot;master&quot; or &quot;palm bar&quot; on the right side of the instrument that can be depressed with the palm to turn on all the reed blocks for the fullest accordion sound.

Large instruments might also rarely have chin switches, which are positioned on top of the instrument and can be changed with the performer's chin. This is useful for if you want to change the timbre without having to take your hand off the keyboard.

[[File:Accordion registers.ogg|left|thumb|Listen to a simple scale played with five different reed combinations. This accordion has three treble reed ranks and has ''musette'' tuning (note the &quot;French&quot;-type flavour on the second scale).]]In a full-sized, four-reed-rank accordion, you will usually have these reeds:

*Two eight-foot (8') or ''clarinet'' reeds, or reeds that sound at pitch. They are sometimes tuned differently from each other to create a European, French-style sound (sometimes called ''musette'' or ''wet'' tuning in accordion parlance). Sometimes they are tuned at the same pitch for a sound more appropriate for classical music (called ''dry'' tuning).

*A sixteen-foot (16') or ''bassoon'' reed, which sounds an octave below the eight-foot reeds.

*A four-foot (4') or ''piccolo'' reed, which sounds an octave above the eight-foot reeds.

Smaller, three-reed accordions are usually missing either the piccolo reed or one of the clarinet reeds.

Sometimes, instead of a four-foot reed there will be a third eight-foot reed that is tuned differently from the other two clarinet reeds. This creates an even more out-of-tune, French-styled sound, but gives you fewer sound possibilities.

On an average instrument, you can use almost any combination of the reeds to produce different sounds suitable for what you're playing.

Following is a table of all eleven possible combinations on a four-voice accordion as well as their names and a short description of their sound quality. Depending on the size of your instrument, you may not have all of these reeds available.

A chromatic button accordion is a type of button accordion where the right side keyboard has rows of buttons arranged chromatically. They have three to five (rarely, some Serbian accordions have six) diagonal rows. Each row can play successive chromatic notes.

[[Image:C-Griff.svg|150px|thumb|left|Chromatic button system (C system)]]
[[Image:B-Griff.svg|150px|thumb|left|Chromatic button system (type system)]]

Chromatic accordions are most popular in Europe and in Russia. In Russia, this instrument is usually called a &quot;bayan&quot; (in Russian: баян).

There are two main types of button accordions. In both types, the further away from the top of the keyboard you go, the higher the notes; the closer to the top, the lower.

Both systems are mirrors of each other, as you can see by the chart to the left. In the &quot;C system&quot; accordion, the middle &quot;C&quot; is on the row furthest to the right. In the &quot;B system&quot;, the &quot;C&quot; is located on the third row from the right. The B system is primarily played in eastern Europe and Russia, while the C system is played

Most chromatic accordions have two extra rows located to the left of the main rows. They play the same notes as the same buttons of the 1st and 2nd rows. This can be helpful when playing a difficult melody, because you do not have to change fingerings when playing in a different key, but only move your hand to the left a row or two and play with the same fingering.

Chromatic accordions have a much larger range than their piano equivalents (they generally go a seventh higher and up to an octave lower). Also, it is possible to use the same fingering for playing almost any melody in any key - whereas on the keyboard you have to learn twelve individual fingerings for each key. Because the notes are positioned much closer together, large leaps and stretches are easier (you can easily stretch two octaves, compared to about a tenth or twelfth on a piano accordion). For these reasons, many professionals prefer playing button instruments. However, depending on where you live, they may be hard to find (in Australasia and North America, they are particularly rare, and even then usually only available in &quot;C system&quot;). Note that this book does not currently cover playing on the button accordion.

A '''diatonic button accordion''' is a type of button accordion where the right keyboard only has the notes of diatonic scales in a small number of keys. The left, or bass side, usually contains the main chords of the instrument's key and their root notes.

Because diatonic accordions have only a few keys they can play in, and usually cannot play accidentals, they are very restricted in what they can play. Usually they can only play folk music and classical music that doesn't contain many accidentals or changes of key signature.

The right hand of a piano accordion is played the same way as you would play a piano, with usually the same fingerings. You can use all fingers, including the thumb, to play on this keyboard.

On a standard, full-sized, the range of the keyboard goes from the &quot;F&quot; below the middle &quot;C&quot;, all the way up to the third &quot;A&quot; above middle &quot;C&quot; (41 notes). Some large instruments have 44 or even 45 keys, going from an &quot;E&quot; or &quot;F&quot; to a high &quot;C&quot;.

An exponential function is a function that includes exponents, such as the function ''y''=2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;.  A Graph of an exponential function becomes a curved line that steadily gets steeper, like the one at the right.

y = x2 

Is this a function?

versus, y2 = x

Is this a function?

The first equation is a function because x has only one y-value,
whereas the second equation has many values.

In a function, each domain value or x-value should only have one y-value, otherwise it is not a function.

Definition: ''In two sets, A and B, a function is a mapping from A to B.''

This mapping should satisfy the following conditions in order for it to be a function:

# All the elements of set A '''''should''''' be paired with any element of set B.
# An element of set A '''''should not''''' be paired with more than one element of set B. (i.e. the first coordinates of an ordered pairs should not be repeated)

== Lesson ==

Algebra is used to make many problems simpler, and that is why a lot of algebra is about finding simple expressions which mean the same thing as harder ones. Variables are given different letters and symbols in algebra so they can be kept apart, so every time &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is used in an expression it means the same thing, and every time &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is used it means the same thing, but a different thing to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (of course this is only in the same expression, different expressions can use the same letters to mean different things). Since the different letters keep the variables apart this means that an expression with many variables in many places can be made simpler by bringing them together.

== Example Problems ==

Here is an example of variables keeping numbers apart even if we don't know them, and this lets us combine them without changing their value: Albert has some books in his bag, he does not know how many. Beth also has some books and she does not know how many. Chris does not know how many books he has, but he knows it is the same as Beth. Dora knows she has the same number of books as Albert. In this example there are 4 lots of books, so we could write the total number of books as:

&lt;math&gt;a + b + c + d&lt;/math&gt;

Since we know that Albert and Dora have the same number of books, and Chris and Beth have the same number of books, we could also write:

&lt;math&gt;a + b + a + b&lt;/math&gt;

This is the same as writing:

&lt;math&gt;2a + 2b&lt;/math&gt;

Here we have grouped both a terms and both b terms. We could also go further, since everything is being multiplied by 2, and write:

&lt;math&gt;2(a + b)&lt;/math&gt;

This is the simplest way of writing how many books there are. Not only were the variables combined, but so were the constants (in this case the number 2). We can check if they are the same by seeing what happens when Albert has 2 books and Beth has 5.

&lt;math&gt;a + b + c + d = 2 + 5 + 2 + 5 = 14&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;2(a + b) = 2(2 + 5) = 2 \times 7 = 14&lt;/math&gt;

*http://www.studystack.com/matching-47007

== Practice Problems ==
(Note: put answer in parentheses after each problem you write)

Simplify these into the form &lt;math&gt;x(y + z)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; are integers or variables.

# &lt;math&gt;15a + 19b + 2a - 2b [ 17(a + b) ]=&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;a + 9 + 2a [ 3(a + 3) ]=&lt;/math&gt; 
# &lt;math&gt;12a + 16b [ 4(3a + 4b) ]=&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;3a - 3b [ 3(a - b) ]=&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;5a + a^2 [ a(5 + a) ]=&lt;/math&gt;

To play Blackjack (other times called &quot;21&quot;) one must have all the cards of a deck except the jokers.

== Goal ==
The goal of Blackjack is to get 21, the best score, or less by adding up the value of the cards. Numbered cards have the value of the number on the card. Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) have a value of 10. The Ace card can have a value of one or 11.

The player with the highest score less than 21 compared to the other players wins the game. Any player with a score greater than 21 looses the game. This is called a &quot;bust&quot; also known as a &quot;boot&quot;.

== Dealing ==
To deal in Blackjack one (first shuffles deck) and then gives a card to each player in a clockwise rotation with the first card dealt face-down then the second card dealt face-up. After the dealing each player should have only two cards.

== Playing ==
Each player has two cards with one exposed to the other players. The player can not hold both cards in his hands as not to be seen. The player looks at the face-down card by lifting one edge to look at the number and not to expose the entire card to the other players.

If the player has 21 the player automatically wins unless tied with another player. If the player has less than 21 the player says &quot;hit me&quot; so that the dealer can give a card to the player. Once the player reaches a number higher than 21 the player &quot;busts&quot; or loses. If a player doesn't want to risk busting and stays with a number less than that of 21 he must have the highest number compared to the other players if that it is less than 21.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Canasta is a card game that is like rummy.  It is played with two decks of cards, including jokers. 

==Object of the Game==
The object of the game is to get 5,000 points before your opponents.  You get points for making canastas (300 or 500 points), red threes (100 points each, but 800 if you get all four), and for cards melded.  You lose points for cards in your hand.  Usually, 4-6 hands must be played.

==Canastas==

==Gameplay==

==End of Game==
The game ends when all cards have been drawn or a player &quot;goes out&quot;.  A player can go out if he has melded or discarded all cards in hand and has at least 500 points in canastas.  When the game is ended, players get points for cards melded and lose points for cards in hand.  Those points are:

*Jokers: 50 points
*Aces and 2s: 20 points
*8, 9, 10, J, Q, K: 10 points
*3, 4, 5, 6, 7: 5 points

      <text xml:space="preserve">A set of cards is called a '''pack'''. A normal pack has 52 cards in it. These are split into four types, known as '''suits''', called '''hearts''', '''clubs''', '''diamonds''' and '''spades'''. There are numbers on the cards, and there is one card of each number in each suit. Some of the cards have a letter rather than a number on them: ones have the letter '''A''' on them, and are known as '''aces''', elevens, twelves and thirteens are known as '''Jacks''', '''Queens''' and '''Kings''', and have the letters J, Q, and K on them. Some games use special cards called '''jokers'''. If jokers are used, there are usually 54 cards in the pack.

==The pack==
The following cards are in a pack:

{{cards|Ah|2h|3h|4h|5h|6h|7h|8h|9h|10h|Jh|Qh|Kh}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Clock''', sometimes called clock solitaire, is a very fun card game played by one person. The goal is to put all the cards into their right time space before finding all the Kings. It is a game of luck.

==Goal==
The goal of the game is to move all the cards in the 13 piles into different places around the clock with each card in the right spot. All four ace cards should be in the one o'clock spot, all four &quot;2&quot; cards should be in the 2 o'clock spot and so on. Look at the picture to see where all the cards should be. The &quot;jack&quot; cards go in the eleven o'clock space and the &quot;queen&quot; card goes into the twelve o'clock space. The Kings go in the center.

==Set-up==
# Find a pack of cards. There should not be any jokers in the pack. Mix up all the cards.
# Split up all the cards into 13 piles. Each pile should have the same number of cards.
# Take 12 of the card piles and make them into a circle shape. Put the 13th pile in the middle of all the cards. [[File:Clock Solitaire.JPG|thumb|200px|You'll want the card piles to be in this shape.]] Make sure that all the cards are facing down towards the table that you're playing on.

'''Note''': The 13th pile, the one in the middle of the circle is also called &quot;the hand&quot;.

==How to play==
# Take the top card from the hand and look at it. 
# Put the card that you just picked up and put it on its right place on the piles. If it's a &quot;six&quot; card, put it on the six o'clock pile at the bottom of the circle. If you picked a &quot;three&quot; card, put it on the three o'clock pile on the right, and so on.
# Pick up another card from the pile you put the first card on. Look at it, then put it on its pile. Again, if it's a &quot;9&quot; card, put it on the nine o'clock spot and so on. Do this over and over. The game is over when all the cards are in the right spots, or when all the kings are in the middle. If the game ends because all the Kings are in the middle, you lose, but if the game ends because the cards are all on their right spots then you win.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Patience''' is quite easy, and you can play it on your own. 52 cards are used. Americans call it '''Solitaire'''.

==Aim==
The aim of patience is to make four piles of cards, one for each suit, sorted into order by the numbers on the cards.

==Set up==
*Shuffle the pack and mix the cards up
*Place seven cards face-down in a line, next to each other
*Turn up the card on the left
*Place six cards on top of the six that are already face down
*Turn up the left card of the second row
*Repeat this until you only put one card down, and turn this up
*Place the deck to one side

==How to play==
* Place any aces in the bottom row into one of four '''foundation piles''' above the rows.
* Turn over the top card of the deck.
* Attempt to place the card in an appropriate spot.
** Cards must switch between red and black.
** Cards must be in order (K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A).
* The goal is to move all cards into the foundation piles.
** Foundation piles must all be the same suit (spades, clubs, hearts, diamonds).
** Foundation piles must be in order (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K).
** You can move an appropriate card to the foundation piles at any time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Snap''' is a very easy game to play. Two people can play snap. It can be played with a pack of 52 or 54 cards, or with several packs of cards, if you want the game to last longer.

==Set up==
[face down] [face up] [face up] [face down]

*Shuffle the pack to mix the cards up
*Give each player half of the pack
*Do not look at your cards
*Put your cards in a pile in front of you, face down.

==How to play==
*Players take it in turn to turn over the top card of their pile.
*This card is put face up onto another pile next to the first pile.
*If the cards both have the same value, one of the players may shout &quot;snap&quot;.
*The first player to shout &quot;snap&quot; when two cards of the same value are showing wins the round.
*The loser has to put all of the cards that are face up onto the bottom of his face-down pile.
*If a player shouts &quot;snap&quot; when the cards do not have the same value, they have to take all of the cards that are face up.
*The winner is the first person to get rid of all their cards.

These cards do not have the same value, so you should not shout &quot;snap&quot;.

[face down] {{cards|5s}} {{cards|7d}} [face down]

Two aces are showing, so you should shout &quot;snap&quot;.

[face down] {{cards|Ah}} {{cards|Ac}} [face down]

==Other versions==
You can also play snap where the cards have to be the same color as well as number in order to match. This is much harder. In this version of the game if the red seven of hearts, and the black seven of clubs come up, you cannot call &quot;snap&quot;. They have to be the same color, like the sevens of hearts and diamonds.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To play War, one must have all the cards of a deck including the jokers. War is usually played with two players, although it is possible to include more players in your game.

== Goal ==
The goal of War is to end up with all of the cards in the deck. You lose the game when you have no more cards left.

== Dealing ==
At the beginning of the game, you shuffle the deck and deal out the cards until all of the players have the same amount of cards.

== Playing ==
Each player takes their cards and holds them in their hands FACE DOWN - you are not allowed to look at the cards. Then, when all the players are ready, they take one card from the top of their face-down deck, and place it face up in front of them. The player with the highest card takes all the other cards and places them all in his discard pile (each player can start their own discard pile in front of them on the table; the cards in it can either be face up or down). Each time a player runs out of cards in his/her hand, the player shuffles the cards in the discard pile and turns the shuffled discard pile into his/her new hand. This process is repeated until there is only one player left because that player has won all of the other cards in the deck.

== Special Rules ==
When all of the players put down the same card at the same time(player A and player B both put down an 8), then there is a special rule called WAR. In WAR, both players immediately take three cards from the top of their hand, and place them FACE DOWN (without looking at them) on the table. Then, on the count of three, all the players place one card from the top of their hand FACE UP on the table. The player who put down the highest card gets all of the cards on the table (the ones from the beginning of the War, the 3 face down ones from the middle, and the final one from the end). If all players put down the same card for their final face up card, then the process of War is repeated on top of the earlier War.

'''Ants on a Log''' is a healthy snack.  Even though it is called &quot;Ants on a log&quot; it does not have ants or logs in it.

== Ingredients ==
* [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] (enough to have 1 or 2 for each person)
* [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]]
* [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]

==Procedure==
# Cut the celery up into pieces, maybe 4 or 5 inches (about 8 cm).  This is the &quot;log&quot;
# Spread peanut butter on top
# Put raisins on top.  These are the &quot;ants&quot;.

== Tips, tricks, and variations ==
Some people are allergic to peanut butter, so before serving it, ask if they are allergic.</text>

{{recipe}}

This stew is a lovely stew to make on cold nights for a family. It is also very simple to make. It is an Egyptian lentil stew, and the recipe is used a lot in the Middle East. In Arabic (the language that people speak in Egypt) this stew is called ''Shorbat Ads'' which means &quot;lentil soup&quot; .

== Equipment ==
You will need the following kitchen ''implements'' (tools such as a knife or a blender that can be found in your kitchen):&lt;br /&gt;
* A knife 
* A cutting-board
* A large pot
* A Tablespoon measure
* A large stirring spoon
* A measuring cup
* A juicer

== Ingredients ==
* 2 Onions
* 4 Tablespoons olive oil
* 8 Cups of water
* 1/2 pound (half lb) of Red Lentils
* 4 Tablespoons of soup mix (you can use any kind of soup mix, or if you don't have any, you can just leave it out)
* 1 Teaspoon Cumin
* 1 Teaspoon Coriander
* 1 Lemon

== Procedure ==
# Take the two onions, and peel them. Then cut them into small pieces.
# Place the chopped onions into your big pot, along with the 4 Tablespoons of olive oil.
# Saute (cook on low heat stirring often) the onions on low heat until they turn clear looking and slightly golden.
# Drop the 8 cups of water into the pot with the onions.
# Drop the lentils into the pot.
# Carefully measure out the soup mix (if your using it) and drop it into the pot.
# Carefully measure out the Cumin and the Coriander and put that into the pot too.
# Stir the stuff in the pot, the turn up the temperature of the stove to about medium heat (you want it to be slightly bubbling, but not boiling).
# Let it cook for an hour, stirring every few minutes to make sure that it doesn't burn. You may have to turn the temperature of the stove up or down a little.
# After 1 hour of cooking, turn off the stove and put the pot on a different burner so that it doesn't continue to cook.
# Take your lemon, and cut it in half. Then, squeeze it on the juicer until there is no more juice in the lemon.
# Take the juice from the lemon, and put it in the pot.
# Stir the pot, taste, and serve!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cricket is a game for two teams of fourteen players. Three players in each team are reserve players and can only replace in fielding department. Total three umpires, two on the field and one in the pavilion, observe &amp; direct the game. A referee also oversees the game and make sure that the game is fair, and rules are followed. He will intervene in case of any dispute or if game is not played in its spirit. 

At the start of the game, the main umpire flips a coin, and the leaders, or ''captains'', of the two teams, guess which side will be showing. The captain who guesses right gets to choose if their team will bat first, or field first.

==Batting==
The people in the team that are batting are called ''batsmen''. Two batsmen come onto the pitch at the start of the game, while the rest wait in a building called a pavilion. The ball is thrown at one of them by a bowler from the other team, and the batsman must protect the three wooden poles called stumps, that they are standing in front of. If they hit the ball, they can run between the two sets of poles, or stumps, which are at each end of the pitch.

When a batsman is [[#Wickets|out]], they go back to the pavilion, and a new batsman comes out to take their place. When ten players are out, there is nobody left who has not batted, so the teams swap, and the other team has a turn to bat.

==Fielding==
The team who are not batting are said to be ''fielding'''. The players in the fielding team have different jobs to do. One person from the fielding team is called the [[Cricket/Word List|wicket-keeper]]. This person stands behind the batsman who the ball is being thrown to, and tries to catch the ball if the batsman does not hit it, or hits it backwards. Several players are bowlers, who take it in turns to throw balls at the batsmen. Each bowler throws six balls, which is called an over.

==Wickets==
If a batsman gets out, it is called a ''wicket''. There are a number of ways in which players can get out. The four most common are for a bowler to hit the stumps with the ball, the batsman to hit the ball and a fielder to catch it, a fielder to hit the stumps with the ball whilst the batsman is running towards them, and for the ball to hit the batsman's leg when a bowler threw it, and it would have hit the stumps if the batsman had not been in the way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Football or soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world.  One of the reasons is that the only equipment the sport needs is a ball and any markers for the goals.  Bring in two teams and the game is on.  Informal games can therefore be very easily set up. 

Formally the game consists of two teams of 11 players.  One of the players is considered a goalkeeper (goalie) and that player's objective is not to allow the ball to go into the goal.  The goalkeeper is the only player who may handle the ball but only in the penalty area that (s)he is defending.  The other ten field players' objective is to score by putting the ball into their opponent's goal, while trying to avoid conceding goals.  They do this by dribbling, passing, and kicking the ball.  The field players can use any part of their body except their hands or arms.  The duration of the game is 90 minutes, with a change of ends and an interval of not more than 15 minutes after 45 minutes.  The referee may make allowance for time lost in each half.  Once the game is over, the team that scores the most goals (the number of times the ball goes in the goal) is declared the winner.  In the case of a draw, and depending on the rules of the competition, a result may be reached by extra time (of 30 minutes duration) or a penalty shoot-out.

== The Field ==

[[Image:Football pitch metric.png|thumb|right|300px|A typical football field]]

Field must be rectangular and either natural or artificial. The field size is directly proportional of league and international matches.

== The Ball ==

All balls are spherical, 27-28 inches (68-70 cm) in circumference and 14-16 oz (410-450g) mass. A ball is not used in a league or international match unless it is FIFA approved.

== The Players ==

The players are 11 on both sides of teams in a match, however substitutes are also available. There are four classes in which the 11 players are divided:-

*'''Goalkeepers''': He/She has to try and stop the other team from scoring (kicking the ball into his goal). The goalkeeper is the only player who can touch the ball with his hands.
*'''Defenders''': They try and stop the other team from scoring by protecting their goal.
*'''Midfielders''': They are the players in between the defenders and strikers. They pass the ball to the strikers so they can score. Midfielders also help defenders (by defending their goal) and strikers (by trying to score themselves).
*'''Strikers''' (also known as '''forwards''' or '''attackers'''): They try to score goals by kicking the ball into the other team's goal.

== The Formations ==

Although there are 11 players on a team there are several commonly used ways to arrange them. The two most commonly used formations today are probably the 4-5-1, 4-3-3, and the 4-4-2 (note: first # is the # of defenders, the second midfielders, and third forwards) although there are some different variations of each.  Two variation of a 4-4-2 are the &quot;flat back four&quot; and a &quot;diamond back&quot; or &quot;sweeper, stopper&quot; where the back four defenders form a diamond with the stopper ahead of the sweeper. Other less commonly used formations are the 3-6-1, 4-2-4, and the 3-5-2.Changes can be made in the formations according to the position of the game . If one team has scored only single goal ,they can change formations in the closing stages of the match or they can put more players forward to score more goals when they are trailing by a goal.

== The Referees ==

There are 4 referees. The centre referee has sole authority, but two assistant referees who officiate from the touchline may advise him, particularly on issues of offsides and whether the ball has left the pitch, or draw his attention to infringements that he may have missed. The fourth referee stands off the pitch in between both team's benches and controls substitutions and keeps track of the games goals, bookings and ejections.

== The Duration ==

A football match consists of two halves and each half is 45 minutes long. Between the two halves, there is an interval, which is not more than 15 minutes long. 

''Stoppage time'' (also called ''injury time'') is the time added on at the end of each half at the discretion of the referee. The stoppage time added is roughly proportional to the length of delays in the game.  These delays may be due to injuries, time lost through substitutions, general time wasting, etc. Although these may seem insignificant, stoppage time can be crucial for losing teams to equalize or even win. One notable example is the 1998-99 UEFA Champions League Final between Bayern Munich and Manchester United. Bayern Munich scored an early goal and controlled most of the match, until Manchester United turned things around with two goals in the 91st and 93rd minutes of the game to win 2-1.

If tied at the end of regulation time, '''in some competitions''' the game may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of penalty shoot outs (known officially in the Laws of the Game as &quot;kicks from the penalty mark&quot;) to determine a winner. Note that goals scored during extra time periods considered part of the final score of the game, unlike kicks from the penalty mark which are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament.

In competitions in which each round involves the two teams playing each other twice, known as ''two-legged ties'', the winner is the team with the highest aggregate score over the two matches.  If this results in a draw, the ''away goals rule'' is usually applied to determine which team progresses: the goals scored by each team away from their nominated venue being compared.  Should results still be equal following this calculation kicks from the penalty mark are usually required. Other competitions may require a tied game to be replayed.

== Scoring ==
&lt;!-- I don't know if this is a good place or not --&gt;[[Image:Gol nhein.gif|130px|right]]
A goal is scored when the ball crosses the goal line entirely, between the goalposts and under the bar, provided the attacking side has not committed an offence. Obviously, the most common way of scoring is by kicking the ball, but the next most common way is to hit the ball with a player's head, more commonly known as 'heading the ball'. Soccer balls headed by highly skilled players can travel over 20 miles per hour. 
== Offsides ==

The application of the offside law is best considered in three steps: Offside position; Offside offence; and Offside sanction.

=== Offside position ===

A player is in an '''offside position''' if &quot;he is nearer to his opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second last opponent&quot;, unless he is in his own half of the field of play. A player level with the second last opponent is considered to be in an onside position. Note that the last two defenders can be either the goalkeeper and another defender, or two ordinary defenders. Also note that offside position is determined when the ball is touched/played by a team-mate - a player's offside position status is not then altered by subsequent runs by players of either side.

It is important to note that ''being in an offside position is not an offence in itself''.

=== Offside offence ===

A player in an offside position is only committing an '''offside offence''' if, &quot;at the moment the ball touches or is played by one of his team&quot;, the player is in the referee's opinion involved in '''active play''' by: interfering with play; interfering with an opponent; or gaining an advantage by being in that position.

Determining whether a play is in &quot;active play&quot; can be complex. A player is not committing an offside offence if the player receives the ball directly from a throw-in, goal kick or corner kick.

FIFA issued new guidelines for interpreting the offside law in 2003 and these were incorporated in law 11 in July 2005. The new wording seeks to more precisely define the three cases as follows:

* Interfering with play means playing or touching the ball passed or touched by a teammate.
* Interfering with an opponent means preventing an opponent from playing or being able to play the ball by clearly obstructing the opponent's line of vision or movements or making a gesture or movement which, in the opinion of the referee, deceives or distracts an opponent.
* Gaining an advantage by being in an offside position means playing a ball that rebounds to him off a post or crossbar or playing a ball that rebounds to him off an opponent having been in an offside position.

The referees' interpretation of these new definitions is still proving controversial till this day, largely over what movements a player in an offside position can make without being judged to be interfering with an opponent.

=== Offside sanction ===

The '''sanction''' for an offside offence is an indirect free kick to the opposing team, from where the offence occurred.

=== Officiating  ===

In enforcing this law, the referee depends greatly on his assistant referee, who generally keeps in line with the second last defender in his relevant end.

The assistant referees' task with regards to off-side can be difficult, as they need to keep up with attacks and counter attacks, consider which players are in an offside position when the ball is played (often from the other end of the field), and then determine whether the offside positioned players become involved in active play. The risk of false judgement is further enhanced by the foreshortening effect, which occurs when the distance between attacking player and the assistant referee is significantly different from the distance to the defending player, and the assistant referee is not directly in line with the defender. The difficulty of off-side officiating is often underestimated by spectators. Trying to judge if a player is level with an opponent at the moment the ball is kicked is not easy: if an attacker and a defender are running in opposite directions, they can be two metres apart in a tenth of a second.

== Free Kicks ==



Free kicks are of two types:-

* Direct Free Kick
* Indirect Free Kick 

Direct free kick is most probably rewarded to a team if the opponent's player touches the ball with his hands or arms (unless he is the goalkeeper within the penalty area) or fouls a player on the other team. An indirect free kick is usually awarded for an infraction of the rules, not necessarily aimed at a player of the opposing team. Direct free kicks are allowed to go into the goal with only one person touching the ball.
  
Indirect free kicks are indicated by the referee raising his arm from the time the foul is awarded until it is first touched by a player other than the taker of the free kick. If a shot from an indirect free kick goes into the opponents' goal without having been touched by another player, no goal is scored and a goal kick is awarded to the defending team. A difficult concept for many to grasp is advantage, a player may foul another player and yet a foul may not be called if that players team does not lose the advantage. An example would be if a player was knocked down in the course of passing the ball to the team mate who scored.

== Penalties ==

A penalty kick is the kick rewarded to a team whose opponent's player commits a foul inside its own box for which the sanction is a direct free kick. The ball is kept at a spot marked 12 yards from the centre of the goal.  No player other than the penalty taker is allowed within 10 yards of the ball until it has been struck: the goalkeeper is the only other player allowed in the penalty area during this time, and he may not advance from his line until the penalty has been taken.  The taker cannot touch the ball again until another player has touched it. A goal is rewarded if the ball goes in the net.

== Throw-ins ==

If the ball leaves the field of play at the side-line, play is restarted with a throw-in (or throw-on).  The thrower must have both feet on the ground, outside of the playing area, and must throw the ball from behind his head with two hands. A goal is not scored if the ball is thrown into the goal from a throw-in without it touching another player.

== Goal Kick ==

If a member of the attacking team is the last person to touch the ball before it crosses the goal line (other than between the posts) or if the ball enters the goal directly from a goal-kick, throw in or indirect free kick, a member of the defending team (usually, but not necessarily, the goalkeeper) restarts play with a kick from inside the area marked by a line 6 yards from the goal.  The ball is not in play until it leaves the penalty area.  A goal may not be scored without another player touching the ball. 

== Corner Kick ==

If a member of the defending team is the last person to touch the ball before it crosses the goal line (other than between the posts) or if the ball enters the goal directly from a goal-kick, throw in or indirect free kick taken by the defending team, a member of the attacking team restarts play with a kick from the quarter circle at the corner of the pitch nearest to where the ball left the pitch.

      <comment>/* Common irregular verbs */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A verb is a word used to describe something that happened, such as an action or state of being.

==Infinitive==
The infinite is a verb without a subject or tense. In English, it is usually &quot;to _____&quot;. In French, all verbs end in -er, -ir, or -re in the infinitive. 

*parler (''to talk'')
*finir (''to finish'')
*entendre (''to hear'')

Most verbs are -er verbs. Many verbs that end in -er end in -ate in English (For example, the verb to donate is &quot;donner&quot;).  Many verbs that end in -ir end in -ish in English (For example, the verb finir means to finish)

The infinitive is used in certain phrases in both English and French

==Conjugating Verbs==
To conjugate a verb means to change it so it can be used with a particular [[:wikt:tense|tense]] and subject.  In French, most verbs are conjugated by taking off the -er, -ir, and -re and adding certain endings depending on the tense.  However, some verbs do not work like and are irregular verbs.

===Common irregular verbs===
Here are twenty verbs that are used a lot, but aren't formed like regular -ER, -IR, or -RE verbs
*aller (''to go'')
*avoir (''to have'')
*boire (''to drink'')
*connaître (''to know'')
*courir (''to run'')
*devoir (''to have to'')
*dire (''to say'', ''to tell'')
*dormir (''to sleep'')
*écrire (''to write'')
*être (''to be'')
*faire (''to do, ''to make'')
*lire (''to read'')
*mentir (''to lie'')
*mettre (''to put'', ''to turn on'')
*mourir (''to die'')
*pouvoir (''to be able to'', ''can'', ''may'')
*prendre (''to take'')
*recevoir (''to recieve'')
*savoir (''to know'')
*venir (''to come'')
*voir (''to see'')
*vouloir (''to want'', ''to wish'')

      <text xml:space="preserve">The present tense is used to say something that is going on right now
Examples: I walk, You talk, he eats
In French, the present is also used to say &quot;I am ____ing&quot; and &quot;I do _____&quot;

==-Er verbs==
This is how you write the present for -er verbs.  You take off the -er and add certain endings:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|Infinitive
|'''parler''' (''to talk'')
|'''donner''' (''to give'')
|'''arriver''' (''to arrive'')
|-
|Stem
|parl-
|donn-
|arriv-
|-
|Je (''I'')
|Je parl'''e'''
|Je donn'''e'''
|J'arriv'''e'''
|-
|Tu (''You'')
|Tu parl'''es'''
|Tu donn'''es'''
|Tu arriv'''es'''
|-
|Il/Elle/On (''He''/''She''/''One'')
|Il parl'''e'''
|Elle donn'''e'''
|On arriv'''e'''
|-
|Nous (''We'')
|Nous parl'''ons'''
|Nous donn'''ons'''
|Nous arriv'''ons'''
|-
|Vous (''You'', ''formal or pl.'')
|Vous parl'''ez'''
|Vous donn'''ez'''
|Vous arriv'''ez'''
|-
|Ils/Elles (''They'')
|Ils parl'''ent'''
|Elles donn'''ent'''
|Ils arriv'''ent'''
|}

Note that if the verb starts with a vowel sound, je is changed to j' (Example: I arrive=J'arrive).  Also, ''tu'' and ''vous'' both mean you.  ''Vous'' is used with multiple people, or as a formality.  ''Tu'' is used informally, like with your friends.

===-Er verbs that change a little===
In order to keep the same sound throughout all tenses and subjects, some -er verbs change a little.  For example, verbs that end in -ger (like manger, ''to eat'' and voyager ''to travel''), add an &quot;e&quot; in the nous form&quot;.  Verbs that end in -cer (like commencer, ''to begin'' and lancer ''to launch'') are almost the same, except they add a cedilla on the c instead of an extra e.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!manger
!commencer
|-
|Je mange
|Je commence
|-
|Tu manges
|Tu commences
|-
|Il mange
|Elle commence
|-
|Nous '''mangeons'''
|Nous '''commençons'''
|-
|Vous mangez
|Vous commencez
|-
|Ils mangent
|Elles commencent
|}

Verbs that end in -yer, such as payer (''to pay'') and employer (''to employ''), change the -y to -i in some conjugations

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!payer
!employer
|-
|Je '''paie'''
|J''''emploie'''
|-
|Tu '''paies'''
|Tu '''emploies'''
|-
|Il '''paie'''
|Elle '''emploie'''
|-
|Nous payons
|Nous employons
|-
|Vous payez
|Vous employez
|-
|Ils '''paient'''
|Elles '''emploient'''
|}

Some verbs that have an e or é in the middle have special rules.  Verbs like acheter ('''to buy''') or espérer ('''to hope'''), change the e or é to an è in some conjugations.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!acheter
!espérer 
|-
|J''''achète'''
|J''''espère'''
|-
|Tu '''achètes'''
|Tu '''espères'''
|-
|Il '''achète'''
|Elle '''espère'''
|-
|Nous achetons
|Nous espérons
|-
|Vous payez
|Vous espérez
|-
|Ils '''achètent'''
|Elles '''espèrent'''
|}
 
Other verbs, like appeler ('''to call''') and jeter ('''to throw'''), double a letter.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!appeler 
!jeter 
|-
|J''''appelle'''
|Je '''jette'''
|-
|Tu '''appelles'''
|Tu '''jettes'''
|-
|Il '''appelle'''
|Elle '''jette'''
|-
|Nous appelons
|Nous jetons
|-
|Vous appelez
|Vous jetez
|-
|Ils '''appellent'''
|Elles '''jettent'''
|}

==-Ir and -Re verbs==
Here are the tables for -ir and -re verbs.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!'''-IR'''
!'''-RE'''
|-
|finir (''to finish'')
|vendre (''to sell'')
|-
|Je fin'''is'''
|Je vend'''s'''
|-
|Tu fin'''is'''
|Tu vend'''s'''
|-
|Il fin'''it'''
|Elle vend
|-
|Nous fin'''issons'''
|Nous vend'''ons'''
|-
|Vous fin'''issez'''
|Vous vend'''ez'''
|-
|Ils fin'''issent'''
|Elles vend'''ent'''
|}

Note that some of the -ir verb forms have an &quot;-iss&quot; in them, and one of the -re verb forms has no ending.

==Irregular verbs==
Most verbs are regular.  Some commonly-used ones are not and have to be learned by heart. Here are some commonly-used irregular verbs in the present tense. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|pouvoir (''to be able to'', ''&quot;can&quot;'', ''&quot;may&quot;'')
|je peux&lt;br&gt;tu peux&lt;br&gt;il peut

|vouloir (''to want'', ''to wish'')
|je veux&lt;br&gt;tu veux&lt;br&gt;il veut
|nous voulons&lt;br&gt;vous voulez&lt;br&gt;ils veulent
|}

==Present Participle==
The present participle is the form of the verb that ends in -ing.  In English, it usually is used with a form of &quot;to be&quot;, such as &quot;I am sneezing&quot; and &quot;They were going&quot;.  In French, they don't use the present participle that way.  Instead, they use the present or the imperfect.  The only time they use the present is when somebody is doing something while doing something else.

*Example: I watch TV while eating
*Becomes: ''Je regarde la télé en mangeant''  

The present participle is formed with the &quot;nous&quot; form of the present tense with the -ons replaced with a -ant

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Verb
!Donner
!Finir
!Vendre
!Manger
|-
|'''Nous form'''
|donnons
|finissons
|vendons
|mangeons
|-
|'''Minus -ons'''
|donn-
|finiss-
|vend-
|mange-
|-
|'''Pres. Part.'''
|'''donnant'''
|'''finissant'''
|'''vendant'''
|'''mangeant'''
|}

Most irregular verbs follow this form 

*faire: '''faisant'''
*boire: '''buvant'''
*écrire: '''écrivant'''

But there are three exceptions:

*avoir: '''ayant'''
*être: '''étant'''
*savoir: '''sachant'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Subtracting is a way of taking a number out from an other number.  It is the opposite of adding.  You use the &quot;''' - '''&quot; sign for the subtracting operation.  If you have 5 apples and give 3 to a friend, you then have 2 apples.   This is '''5 - 3 = 2''' using the signs of mathematics.

Order is important when subtracting.  '''3 - 2''' is not the same as '''2 - 3'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Multiplying is a way of adding a number many times.  You use the &quot;''' × '''&quot; sign for the multiplying operation.  If you have 4 apple trees and every tree has 25 apples, you have 100 apples.  This is '''4 × 25 = 100''' or '''25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 100''' in the signs of mathematics.  The first way is shorter and easier to use.  

Multiplying 25 by 4 is the same as adding 25, 4 times or adding 4, 25 times.

Order is not important when multiplying.  '''2 × 3''' is the same as '''3 × 2'''.

*'''120 × 11'''
*'''132 × 120'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dividing is the opposite of multiplying.  You use the &quot;''' ÷ '''&quot; sign for the dividing operation.  If 3 friends take an equal part of a bag of 12 apples, every friend gets 4 apples.  This is '''12 ÷ 3 = 4''' in the signs of mathematics.

Order is important when dividing.  '''3 ÷ 2''' is not the same as '''2 ÷ 3'''.

== Lesson ==
Evaluate the expression '''3 + 4 × 5'''.

If you '''add''' first, it is '''7 × 5''' and evaluates to '''35'''.

If you '''multiply''' first, it is '''3 + 20''' and evaluates to '''23'''.

Is the first or second answer true?

With no '''order of operations''' all of the two answers are true.  If an expression evaluates to more than one answer, math does not work.  The order of operations says the order you do operations, so there is only one way to evaluate an expression.

You use '''precedence''' to make the order of operations.  All operations have a precedence that is more, less, or the same as an other operation.  You do operations with more precedence before you do operations with less precedence.  You do operations with the same precedence from left to right.

This list says the order of precedence for operations.  Operations at the top of the list have more precedence than operations at the bottom of the list.  Operations on the same line have the same precedence.
*Brackets '''( )''' or '''[ ]'''
*Raise '''^'''
*Multiply '''×''', Divide '''÷'''
*Add '''+''', Subtract '''-'''  

'''Brackets''' is a special operation that has the most precedence.  You use the '''(''' and ''')''' signs to make a separate expression from a group of numbers.  You evaluate an expression in parenthesis first.  You use parenthesis if you need to do an operation with less precedence first.

===Adding and Subtracting===

|[[Image:PlusCircle.svg]] - [[Image:SmallMinusCircle.svg]] = [[Image:PlusCircle.svg|45px]]

Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting a positive number.
:&lt;math&gt;7+-4=7-4&lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number.
:&lt;math&gt;7--4=7+4&lt;/math&gt;

===Multiplying and Dividing===

Multiplying a negative number by a positive number, or a positive number by a negative number makes the answer negative.
:&lt;math&gt;-2\times3=-6&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2\times-3=-6&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying a negative number by a negative number makes the answer positive.
:&lt;math&gt;-2\times-3=6&lt;/math&gt;

Do the same for dividing.
:&lt;math&gt;-6\div3=-2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;6\div-3=-2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;-6\div-3=2&lt;/math&gt;

== Lesson ==
===Why use Decimals?===
Some fractions have big numbers and are difficult to use.  For example, which of the next fractions is the most?


*&lt;math&gt;\frac{44467}{38973}&lt;/math&gt;


*&lt;math&gt;\frac{82489}{71035}&lt;/math&gt;


*&lt;math&gt;\frac{8993}{7873}&lt;/math&gt;


Show the fractions as mixed fractions and it might be easier to answer which is most.


*&lt;math&gt;\frac{44467}{38973}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;1\frac{5494}{38973}&lt;/math&gt;


*&lt;math&gt;\frac{82489}{71035}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;1\frac{11454}{71035}&lt;/math&gt;


*&lt;math&gt;\frac{8993}{7873}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;1\frac{1120}{7873}&lt;/math&gt;
 
It is still difficult to answer which is most.  A different way to show fractions makes answering easier.

===Decimal Numbers===
'''Decimals Numbers''' have two parts, the same way that mixed numbers have two parts. The two parts are separated by a small circle called a '''decimal point'''. The part of the decimal number to the right of the decimal point is the fraction part. The part to the left is the whole part. The way you find the decimal form of a number is by dividing by hand or using a calculator. These are examples of fractions in decimal form:

*&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2}=1.5&lt;/math&gt;


*&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{5}=0.2&lt;/math&gt;


*&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{10}=0.1&lt;/math&gt;


*&lt;math&gt;\frac{51}{25}=2.04&lt;/math&gt;


*&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{40}=0.025&lt;/math&gt;


*&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{100}=0.01&lt;/math&gt;


Just like place amounts made it easy to show big normal numbers, '''decimal places''' make it easy to show fractions with big numbers. '''''Note:''' one tenth = &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{10}&lt;/math&gt;, one hundredth = &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{100}&lt;/math&gt;''

|-
| &lt;math&gt;.46289&lt;/math&gt;'''{{font color|magenta|7}}''' || {{fontcolor|magenta|7 millionths}}
|}

===Almost Equal===
Sometimes when you change a fraction to a decimal the number will never end. For example, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; becomes 0.33333333333333333333333… and the threes repeat forever. Because you can not write a number that goes on forever, you use only as much as you need for answering your math question. 

When you remove a part of a number it is no longer the same number, but because the new number is almost the same as the old number, you can still use it to answer questions about the old number. The '''almost equal sign (≈)''' is a special sign you use for when two numbers are almost the same. For example: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}\approx0.333333&lt;/math&gt;

===Which is the most?===
Using decimal numbers it is now easy to find which fraction is the most.
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{44467}{38973}\approx1.140969389064&lt;/math&gt; 


*&lt;math&gt;\frac{82489}{71035}\approx1.161244456958&lt;/math&gt;


*&lt;math&gt;\frac{8993}{7873}\approx1.142258351327&lt;/math&gt;

Because there is a 6 in the hundredths place you know the second fraction is most.

== Lesson ==
Often it is useful to use numbers for amounts that are only a part of a bigger amount.  For example: you cut an apple into six parts and give one to a friend.  How much of the apple do you have left?  You have five parts of six.  There is a special way to show this amount, using numbers.

=== Fractions ===

A '''fraction''' is two numbers, one on top of the other, with a line in the middle, like this: &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{6}&lt;/math&gt;.  The higher number is the '''numerator'''.  It shows how many parts.  The lower number is the '''denominator'''.  It shows you the amount of parts that make one thing.  If the denominator is big, the parts are small.
{|align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10px&quot; 
|+If a denominator is big, the parts are small.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{2}&lt;/math&gt; || '''=''' || [[image:PieChartFractionHalvesSplit.svg|100px]]
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{3}&lt;/math&gt; || '''=''' || [[image:PieChartFractionThirdsSplit.svg|100px]]
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{4}&lt;/math&gt; || '''=''' || [[image:PieChartFractionFourthsSplit.svg|100px]]
|}

When the numerator and denominator are the same, the fraction is equal to one.  For positive fractions, when the numerator is less than the denominator, the fraction is less than one, and when the numerator is greater than the denominator, the fraction is greater than one (the opposite is true for negative fractions).  The denominator can never be zero.

When a fraction is more than one, you can show it as a '''mixed fraction'''.  Mixed fractions are a normal number followed by a fraction.  For example, the fraction on the right of the equals sign is a mixed fraction.

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{11}{6} = 1\frac{5}{6}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== More, Less, and Equal ===

These are examples of equal fractions:
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1}=\frac{2}{2}=\frac{3}{3}&lt;/math&gt;  
::[[image:Equal_Fractions_123.svg|250px]]
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}=\frac{2}{4}=\frac{3}{6}&lt;/math&gt;
These are examples of more and less fractions:
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{4} &lt; \frac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
::[[image:PieChartFractionComparisonFourthsLess.svg|200px]]
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3} &gt; \frac{2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
::[[Image:PieChartFractionComparisonFourthsThirdsGreater.svg|200px]]
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3} &lt; \frac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Normal Numbers ===

Normal numbers are the numbers you use most often.  They show an amount of separate things.  The picture under shows how normal numbers show how many of a thing.  0 (Zero) is a special number for when there is nothing.

=== Numerals and Place Amounts ===

A number is one or more signs that are called '''numerals''' (like a word is one or more signs that are called letters).  There are ten numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) that can make most numbers.  Each numeral has a place in a number and shows a different amount when it is in a different place.  The '''place amount''' is the amount a numeral shows in a place.

The first place (going from right to left) has a place amount of one, and it is the Ones Place.  A numeral in the Ones Place shows the normal amount.  The next place has a place amount of ten, and it is the Tens Place.  Numerals in the Tens Place show how many groups of ten.  The next place is the Hundred Place because one hundred is ten groups of ten.  The next place is the Thousand Place because one thousand is ten groups of one hundred.  A place amount is a group of ten of the place amount one place to the right.

If every number had a special sign, then you would need a big book of signs to know all the numbers.  This system of numerals and place amounts is useful because ten signs can make a very many numbers.

=== More, less, and equal ===

Often it is useful to look at two amounts and show which one is more, less or equal to the other.  Math has special signs to show this.

The ''equals'' sign is two lines like this: &quot;''' = '''&quot;.  Use it between two amounts that are the ''same''.  These are some examples:
*&lt;math&gt;5=5&lt;/math&gt;
*[[image:CountingSquareOrangeTen.svg]] &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; [[image:CountingSquareOrangeTen.svg]]
*&lt;math&gt;3462897 = 3462897&lt;/math&gt;

The ''more than'' sign is a bent line like this: &quot;''' &gt; '''&quot;.  Use it to show that an amount on the left of the sign is ''more'' than an amount on the right.  These are some examples:
*&lt;math&gt;10&gt;5&lt;/math&gt;
*[[image:CountingSquareOrangeTen.svg]] &lt;math&gt;&gt;&lt;/math&gt; [[image:CountingSquareOrangeFive.svg]]
*&lt;math&gt;485&gt;394&lt;/math&gt;

The ''less than'' sign is a bent line like this: &quot;''' &lt; '''&quot;.  Use it to show that an amount on the left of the sign is ''less'' than an amount on the right.  These are some examples:
*&lt;math&gt;2&lt;3&lt;/math&gt;
*[[image:CountingSquareOrange.svg]][[image:CountingSquareOrange.svg]] &lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt; [[image:CountingSquareOrange.svg]][[image:CountingSquareOrange.svg]][[image:CountingSquareOrange.svg]]
*&lt;math&gt;3887 &lt; 3902&lt;/math&gt;

These are some signs people use less often:
* The ''not equal'' sign is this: &quot;''' ≠ '''&quot;.  Use it between two amounts that are ''not'' the ''same''. An alternative is &quot;''' != '''&quot;.
* The ''more or equal'' sign is this: &quot;''' ≥ '''&quot;.  Use it to show that an amount on the left of the sign is ''more'' than or the ''same'' as an amount on the right. An alternative is &quot;''' &gt;= '''&quot;.
* The ''less or equal'' sign is this: &quot;''' ≤ '''&quot;.  Use it to show that an amount on the left of the sign is ''less'' than or the ''same'' as an amount on the right. An alternative is &quot;''' =&lt; '''&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">According to the widely accepted [[w:Big Bang|Big Bang]] theory, the [[w:Universe|Universe]] began at some point in space and time around 13,700,000,000 years ago, as evidenced by the [[w:Doppler effect|Doppler effect]] observed in all stars and a 3 degree Kelvin background radiation observed elsewhere. 

*In about 10E-43 seconds, physics became defined and gravity separated from other forces. The Universe was 10E32 K in temperature.
*At 10E-35 seconds, the Universe expanded to the size of a softball and the [[w:strong nuclear force|strong nuclear force]] separated. Energy turned into [[w:quark|quark]]s and electrons and their anti-matter counterparts. The temperature was 1027 K.
*At 10E-6 seconds, quarks began to bind into protons and neutrons; matter and antimatter destroyed each other and the balance turned out to be in favor of matter. The Universe was about the size of our solar system and 1013 K hot.
*1 second after its inception, the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces appeared as the Universe cooled to 109 K.
*3 minutes later, protons and neutrons fused into nuclei.
*After 100,000 years, the electrons and the nuclei came together to form atoms; photons separated from matter and there was light.
*In the next 1,000,000,000 years the Universe became clumpy as galaxies began to take shape.
*Ever since then, the Universe has cooled down to 3 K, galaxies have developed, generations of stars have passed, creating heavier elements, and life has appeared. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, contains about 200,000,000,000 stars and lies 1 million light years from its nearest neighbor.
*The solar system was formed around 4,600,000,000 years ago as dust collapsed into the protostar that was to become the Sun, and into planetesimals orbiting it. The inner planets, from Mercury to Mars, are solid because the solar winds have driven gases away and have a core; the outer planets are larger and consist of gas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The crust is the outer-most layer of the earth, the layer we live on. There are two kinds of crust: the continental and the oceanic. The continental crust lies beneath land and it varies from 35-70km thick. The oceanic crust lies under seas and oceans (not just any body of water) and ranges from 5-10km thick. Under the crust is a layer called the lithosphere. The lithosphere is made up of giant, puzzle-like pieces of rock called tectonic plates. Continents have their own plates with oceanic plates and minor plates filling in the gaps. The lithosphere floats on a layer of hot magma called the asthenosphere. The asthenosphere has a convection current, made by magma swirling around in a circular motion, from top to bottom. The convection current is what makes the plates move.
  
The asthenosphere is part of a gigantic layer that takes up a full 2/3 of the Earth's radius: the mantle. The asthenosphere is part of the upper mantle, closest to the crust. The upper mantle is made of magma and hot silicon, iron, magnesium, and oxygen. Its texture is a thick, plasticky, fluid: not unlike half-dried glue. The lower mantle is made of the same materials as the upper mantle, but it is solid rock. It extends to 2,900km below the surface of the earth. 
 
The Earth's core is divided into two parts: inner and outer. The outer core is Earth's only entirely liquid layer. It is made up of molten iron and nickel and is 2,200km thick. The inner core can be found 5,100km below the surface. It is a hard ball of extremely hot iron. The inner core was created by the pressure of all the outer layers pushing in on it. The inner core is suspended, floating, in the outer core. It spins at a different rate from the rest of the earth and scientists believe that this, along with the convection current in the asthenosphere, creates the magnetic field that surrounds the earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Plate Tectonics is a theory that almost all of the world's scientists believe is true. It involves tectonic plates: puzzle-like formations under the Earth's crust that are floating on a layer of magma called the mantle. The mantle is a layer of the earth. The crust is another, it is what we live on. Tectonic plates are part of a layer called the lithosphere. The lithosphere floats on a section of the upper mantle called the asthenosphere. The asthenosphere is a place where hot magma swirls in a convection current. This current causes the movement of the tectonic plates. 
  
Tectonic plates are constantly moving around, colliding, and drifting apart. Sometimes one plate slides under the other. This is called subduction. Divergence means that two plates are sliding apart, and convergence is the opposite. Transform is when the edges of two plates slide along each other. When plates collide, it can cause earthquakes and tsunamis. Volcanoes, however, are more commonly caused by subduction, because when two plates part it allows the magma in the mantle to burst forth.

'''Geology''' (from Greek γη- (ge-, &quot;the earth&quot;) and λογος (&quot;logos&quot;, &quot;word&quot;, &quot;reason&quot;)) is the science and study of the solid matter of a celestial body, its composition, structure, physical properties, history and the processes that shape it. In this book, the term Geology will apply to the [[w:Earth|Earth]] in particular.

Geology can be split into two main branches: historical and physical. Historical geology attempts to understand the origins, composition, systems and changes of the Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''asthenosphere''' is part of Earth's mantle. It lies about 100 km to 350 km under the surface.

It consists of hot, weak material that can be deformed like silly putty. That means it is capable of gradual flow. It lies under the [[../Lithosphere|lithosphere]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''crust''' is the outer hard layer of the planet. The crust is a part of the [[../Lithosphere|lithosphere]]. On Earth, the crust is under the [[w:troposphere|troposphere]] and above the ocean. It is important to remember that not every geological sphere has a crust. The crust on Earth is being created through a process called Continental Drift, but on the moon it is not being made. The crust has two different parts. One is the continental, and the other is oceanic. The continental crust is thicker, and the oceanic crust is thinner. Thicknesses of the crust can be anywhere from 5-70&amp;nbsp;km.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Earth_cross_section-i18.png|thumb|400px|The Inner Core is labeled Number 7 on this cross-section of the Earth.]]
==What is the inner core and who discovered it?==
The inner core is the very center of the planet and is the hottest part of a planet. The inner core was discovered by Inge Lehmann in 1929. Inge Lehmann was studying a large New Zealand earthquake. An earthquake makes vibrations which move across the inside of the Earth. The vibrations that Inge Lehmann was studying seemed to be moving across something solid in the center of the planet. She wrote about this inner core for many years but it was not proved to exist until 1970, when studies were much more exact. 

==Where is it, how big is it, and what is it made of?==
The inner core is between 300 and 400 kilometers wide and more than 12,000 kilometers below our feet. It is believed to be made of molten (melted) iron and nickel but the Earth is so heavy that the inner core does not move like a liquid. Scientists believe that the inner core may be hotter than the surface (edge) of the Sun at near 106,000 °C. 

==What other ideas are there about the inner core?==
The inner core was thought to be a type of huge diamond because diamonds are made by huge weight but studying the way the Earth vibrates shows that the inner core is not as solid as a diamond. There may be smaller diamonds but it is not possible to know because of the huge heat and weight of the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''lithosphere''' is the solid shell of a rocky planet called earth. That means the crust and the upper part of the  mantle which is joined to the crust (see picture on the right).

Under the lithosphere there is the asthenosphere, the weaker, hotter, and deeper part of the upper mantle.  
[[File:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|left|280px|'''Picture 2:''' The tectonic plates of the Lithosphere on Earth.]]
The lithosphere is the surface layer of the fluid parts of the Earth's convection system, therefore it thickens over time. It is broken up into pieces called plates (shown in picture on the left), which move independently relative to one another. This movement of lithospheric plates is described as plate tectonics. 

The division of Earth's outer layers into lithosphere and asthenosphere should not be confused with the chemical subdivision of the outer Earth into mantle, and crust. All crust is in the lithosphere, but lithosphere generally contains more mantle than crust.


There are two types of lithosphere:
* Oceanic lithosphere, which is associated with Oceanic crust
* Continental lithosphere, which is associated with Continental crust
Oceanic lithosphere is typically about 50-100 km thick (but beneath the mid-ocean ridges is no thicker than the crust). Continental lithosphere is thicker (about 150 km). It consists of about 50 km of crust and 100 km or more of uppermost mantle. 

Oceanic lithosphere consists mainly of mafic crust and ultramafic mantle and is denser than continental lithosphere, for which the mantle is associated with crust made of felsic rocks. The crust is distinguished from the upper mantle by the change in chemical composition that takes place at the Moho discontinuity.  Oceanic lithosphere thickens as it ages and moves away from the mid-ocean ridge. This thickening occurs by conductive cooling, which converts hot asthenosphere into lithospheric mantle, and causes the oceanic lithosphere to become increasingly dense with age. Oceanic lithosphere is less dense than asthenosphere for a few tens of millions of years, but after this becomes increasingly denser than asthenosphere. The gravitational instability of mature oceanic lithosphere has the effect that at subduction zones the oceanic lithosphere invariably sinks underneath the overriding lithosphere, which can be oceanic or continental. New oceanic lithosphere is constantly being produced at mid-ocean ridges and is recycled back to the mantle at subduction zones. As a result, oceanic lithosphere is much younger than continental lithosphere: the oldest oceanic lithosphere is about 170 million years old, while parts of the continental lithosphere are billions of years old. 

Another distinguishing characteristic of the lithosphere is its flow properties. Under the influence of the low-intensity, long-term stresses that drive plate tectonic motions, the lithosphere responds essentially as a rigid shell and thus deforms primarily through brittle failure, whereas the asthenosphere (the layer of the mantle below the lithosphere) is heat-softened and accommodates strain through plastic deformation.

Earth's '''mantle''' is the 2,900 km thick rocky shell making up about 84% of Earth's volume. It is mostly solid and lies over the Earth's iron-rich core, which takes up about 15% of Earth's volume.  Past episodes of melting and volcanism at the outer levels of the mantle have produced a very thin [[../Crust|crust]] of crystallized melt products near the surface, where we live. The gases evolved during the melting of Earth's mantle have a large effect on the composition and size of Earth's atmosphere.

On March 5, 2007, a team of scientists on board the RRS James Cook went on a voyage to an area of the Atlantic seafloor where the mantle has no crust covering.  The anomaly is located mid-way between the Cape Verdes Islands and the Caribbean in the Atlantic Ocean. It lies about three kilometres under the ocean surface and covers thousands of square kilometres.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Oceanic crust is the part of Earth's lithosphere that surfaces in the ocean basins. Oceanic crust is primarily composed of mafic rocks, or sima. It is thinner than continental crust, or sial, generally less than 10 kilometers thick, however it is denser, having a mean density of about 3.3 grams per cubic centimeter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The outer core of the Earth is a liquid layer about 2,260 km thick composed of iron and nickel which lies above the Earth's solid inner core and below its mantle. Its outer boundary lies approximately 2,890 km (1,800 mi) beneath the Earth's surface. The transition between the inner core and outer core is located approximately 5,150 km beneath the Earth's surface.

The temperature of the outer core ranges from 4400 °C in the outer regions to 6100 °C near the inner core. Eddy currents in the nickel iron fluid of the outer core are believed to influence the Earth's magnetic field. The outer core is not under enough pressure to be solid, so it is liquid even though it has a composition similar to that of the inner core. Sulfur and oxygen could also be present in the outer core.

Without the outer core, life on Earth would be very different. Scientists believe that the convection of liquid metals in the outer core creates the Earth's magnetic field. This magnetic field extends outward from the Earth for several thousand kilometers, and creates a protective bubble around the Earth that deflects the Sun's solar wind. Without this field, the solar wind would have blasted away our atmosphere, and Earth would be lifeless like Mars.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rugby union is a very fun game played outdoors. It is full contact, and is seen as very violent by a lot of people.  There are 2 main types of rugby: '''rugby union''' and '''rugby league'''.  Rugby is played throughout the world, particularly in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Italy and Argentina.

==Equipment==
Unlike American [[football]], rugby players wear very small amounts of equipment. They usually have only a jersey, rugby socks, rugby cleats, and a mouthguard. Practises usually use simple drills, that only need equipment like pylons and a ball. The rugby ball looks very different from other kinds of balls. It is fatter than an American football, but it has a lot more grip.

===The Field===
A [http://www.rugbygames.org/ Rugby] field is 100 meters from one end zone to the other, and it is 77 meters across. The end zones are 22 meters long. The posts at either end of the field look like soccer goals on the bottom, with long posts coming up from the horizontal bar.

==Moving the Ball==
You cannot throw the ball forward in rugby, it always has to go backwards. You can kick the ball at anytime, but you have to be careful of offsides. Offside rules will be explained in the [[../Rules|rules]] section.

==Scoring==
A '''try''' is scored by taking the ball into the end zone, and touching it down on the ground. A try is worth 5 points. After a try, the team kicker will kick the ball for an extra point. The place the kicker kicks the ball from depends on where the try was scored. You can also score a '''drop goal''' at any time in the game. All you have to do is drop the ball, and kick it once it bounces off the ground. If the ball goes through the uprights, your team gets three points. Finally, you can score penalty kicks. If the other team gets a penalty (your team gets the ball), you can '''kick for posts'''. The referee will set up a tee for you at the place where the penalty happened. If the ball is kicked through the uprights, your team scores three points.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Props are usually the some of the biggest players on the field. They are part of the '''[[../Rules#Scrum|scrum]]'''. There are 2 props on the field per team.

==Responsibilities==
===In the Scrum===
* Support the hooker
* Push back the other team
* Hold the front row together

===In Open Play===
* Follow the ball, in order to support the runner
* Mark and tackle the other team's big players
* Be active in the [[../Rules#Rucks|ruck]]
* Be ready to run the ball into the other team's defense

===In Lineouts===
* Lift the [[../Lock|lock]] into the air
* Be ready to stop the other team if they steal the throw-in

      <text xml:space="preserve">The scrum half passes the ball from the back of the [[../Rules#Scrum|scrum]] to the [[../Fly Half|fly half]]. He kicks very much and he also calls plays for the backs a lot. They are often the team captain.

==Responsibilities==

===In the Scrum===
* Put the ball in
* Throw the ball to the fly half
* Kick the ball from the scrum when they have to
* Tell the [[../8-man/]] to &quot;rush&quot; the ball if they feel it is a good idea
* Attack the other scrum half if it is the other team's put-in

===In General Play===
* Always speedy, runs the ball a lot
* Be in the back line
* Pass the ball out of [[../Rules#Rucks|rucks]]
* Be ready to tackle at all times

===In the Lineout===
* Sometimes calls the play
* Gets the ball from the player that catches it
** They can run, pass, or kick the ball at that point
* Attack the other scrum half if it is the other team's throw-in

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

This template creates a dynamic navigation box using style sheet declarations in [[MediaWiki:Common.css/Nav.css]] and JavaScript code in [[MediaWiki:Common.js/CollapsibleElements.js]]. It displays the first parameter (the heading) with a [show] link on the right.  If [show] is clicked by the user, the second parameter (the body) is displayed below the heading and the [show] link becomes [hide].  Clicking on [hide] then hides the body again and the [hide] link becomes [show] again.

The template does '''not''' provide an argument to designate the initial state of the show/hide control.  In the nested case, show/hide controls in hidden content retain their state.  There is no facility for ''collapse all'' or ''reveal all''.  

===Usage===
Only two parameters are required for this template:
;header : text for header (or title); alternative to using unnamed parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
;content : text for content (or body); alternative to using unnamed parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

====Optional parameters====
;style : add [[w:Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] to the main div.
;headerstyle : add [[w:Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] to the header.
;contentstyle : add [[w:Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] to the content box.
;noprint : if anything is put in for this parameter the hidden box (and its contents) won't show up in the printed version.

'''Note:''' This template will not respect the user preference &quot;justify paragraphs&quot;.

===Examples===
====The simplest====
In this example only the two required parameters are specified.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| {{rh}} | Code
| &lt;pre&gt;{{hidden|Title text here|Body text line 1&lt;br/&gt;Body text line 2}}&lt;/pre&gt;
|-
| {{rh}} | Result
| {{hidden|Title text here|Body text line 1&lt;br/&gt;Body text line 2}}
|}

====Header background====
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| {{rh}} | Code
| &lt;pre&gt;{{hidden|Title text here|Body text line 1&lt;br/&gt;Body text line 2|headerstyle=background:#ccccff|bodystyle=text-align:center}}&lt;/pre&gt;
|-
| {{rh}} | Result
| {{hidden|Title text here|Body text line 1&lt;br/&gt;Body text line 2|headerstyle=background:#ccccff|bodystyle=text-align:center}}
|}


====CSS====
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| {{rh}} | Code
| 
&lt;pre&gt;
{{hidden
| style = border:1px dashed red; width: 50%;
| headerstyle = background: #ccccff; font-size: 110%;
| contentstyle = text-align: center; color:green;
| header = Title text here
| content = Body text line 1&lt;br /&gt;Body text line 2&lt;br /&gt;Body text line 3
}}&lt;/pre&gt;
|-
| {{rh}} | Result
| 
{{hidden
| style = border:1px dashed red; width: 50%;
| headerstyle = background: #ccccff; font-size: 110%;
| contentstyle = text-align: center; color:green;
| header = Title text here
| content = Body text line 1&lt;br /&gt;Body text line 2&lt;br /&gt;Body text line 3
}}

|}

=== Issues ===
==== Sections ====
Sections included inside a hidden block result in broken anchors in the table of contents at the top of the page.
{{hidden begin|title=example}}
===== You can't get here from the table of contents =====
{{hidden end}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">I note what seems to be an error on the page.  The author uses as an example in the beginning f(x)=x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and then states that for this function the delta value can be obtained by taking the square root of a desired epsilon.

By my understanding of the author's definition of the limit this is not correct.  To illustrate:

I am given an epsilon of .002 - this means that the delta values that I plug in will be allowed to vary the result f(x) by plus or minus .002.  Given the example, attaining the limit of f(x) @ 2, this means to me that the delta I use would have to produce a maximum positive value for f(x) of 4.002.  Working backwards, this would require an x value of 2.0005 meaning that the positive delta would be .0005 but taking the square root of the original epsilon I receive .045 - these two values do not coincide.

To verify, if I accept the square root of epsilon as producing my delta then f(2.045)=4.18203 - far outside the variance of the original epsilon.

I haven't been able to determine what the proper formula would be to derive the proper delta from a given epsilon in this case, but I thought it necessary to point this out.

:You're right.  Using &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=0.002&lt;/math&gt;, the rule &lt;math&gt;\delta=\sqrt\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; would imply that choosing &lt;math&gt;\delta=0.044&lt;/math&gt;, which is slightly less than &lt;math&gt;\sqrt\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, should satisfy the definition of the limit.  That is, for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;0&lt;|x-2|&lt;0.044&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;0&lt;|x^2-4|&lt;0.002&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;x=2.043&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;0&lt;|2.043-2|=0.043&lt;0.044&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;0&lt;|2.043^2-4|=0.173849\nless0.002&lt;/math&gt;.

:I derived an appropriate delta function as example 5 in [[Calculus/Choosing delta]], and I updated the text of [[Calculus/Formal Definition of the Limit]].  Thanks for pointing it out!  --[[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 16:27, 23 March 2011 (UTC)

'''{{tl|{{BASEPAGENAME}}}}''' links to the incomplete Google Patents search, by default. With the optional src parameter it will link to the more complete online [[w:USPTO|USPTO]] patent application with [[w:Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]] images for pre-1976 patents and full-text for post 1976 patents. The Google search may provide a PDF transcript of the text extracted from the TIFF images. If your browser has difficulty displaying or downloading TIFF images, consider installing a TIFF capable extension such as AlternaTIFF for [[w:Mozilla Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]], [[w:Opera (web browser)|Opera]], and [[w:Google Chrome|Google Chrome]], browsers (and [[w:Netscape (web browser)|Netscape]] 9.0.0.6), or use a TIFF capable browser such as [[w:Links (web browser)|Links]] or [[w:Safari (web browser)|Safari]] version 3.2.1 (may display the wrong size but allows full images to be saved).&lt;!-- these versions and AlternaTIFF version 1.8.3.1 were just tested, earlier versions might also work --&gt;

'''Because Google patent search does not include all the USPTO patents, please consider providing two template calls, one with the src parameter and the other with no named parameter to default to the Google search'''

CAUTION: This patent template is not as featured as the generic one (patent), and it should not be used except for older patents and possibly other circumstances. From &quot;Template:Cite patent/doc&quot;:

&quot;Simple patent template for citing patents or patent applications from any country in the esp@cenet database. This database is more useful than the USPTO database since it highlights related patents/applications in other countries, provides current status information, and is available in three languages. However, the {{US patent}} template is not deprecated because the USPTO database does include items (such as some older US patents) which are not included in the espacenet database.&quot;

== Parameters ==
;1 (mandatory): The US patent number '''without''' commas, commas will be inserted by the template.  While the USPTO parser ignores commas other services (notably [http://www.google.com/patents Google Patents]) cannot handle them.  For design or reissued patents prefix with &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;RE&lt;/code&gt;, respectively; see [http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm Patent Search Help] for the full list.

;2 (optional): Link title.  Use &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#124;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#61;&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.

;src (optional): &lt;tt&gt;|src=uspto&lt;/tt&gt; will cause the template to use the more complete USPTO patent search

== Examples ==

I'm moving some of the pages so some of the locations may be off, take a look into [[C++ Programming/Examples]] to see all the examples already segregated (this also helps maintain the code part of the book).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:10, 24 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

This template can be used in place of a literal &quot;&lt;&quot; when the latter would be interpreted as a syntactic marker.  In particular, it can be used inside templates meant for subst:ing, together with the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;subst:&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; trick, to allow the subst:ed output to contain HTML comments that contain other subst:ed templates, [[meta:Help:Parser function|parser functions]] or [[meta:Help:Variable|variables]].  This works even under the [[meta:Migration to the new preprocessor|new parser]], which doesn't otherwise allow code within comments to be evaluated.

For example, the code &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;includeonly&gt;subst:&lt;/includeonly&gt;lessthan}}!-- {{&lt;includeonly&gt;subst:&lt;/includeonly&gt;SITENAME}} --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; in a template produces &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!-- Wikibooks --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; when subst:ed.

This is clearly a reference to Charles Carroll of Carrollton.  His father was Charles Carroll (of Annapolis), and his grandfather was Charles Carroll (of Baltimore or the Settler).  Since there are multiple Charles Carrolls, do we want to rename this to Charles Carroll of Carrollton?

:There's only one Charles Carroll who signed the Declaration, so it seems to me &quot;Charles Carroll&quot; is the correct title for the article.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 19:55, 24 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

This template builds nicer-looking [[w:common fraction|common fraction]]s. It takes one, two or three parameters: the optional integer (may be signed), the optional numerator and the required denominator; in this order. Please '''don't''' substitute it.

===Usage===
; &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{frac|A|B|C}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: {{frac|A|B|C}} (integer, numerator and denominator)
; &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{frac|A|B}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: {{frac|A|B}} (numerator and denominator)
; &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{frac|A}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;: {{frac|A}} (denominator only)

===Examples===
{{frac|2}} {{frac|3}} {{frac|2|3}} {{frac|4}} {{frac|2|4}} {{frac|3|4}} {{frac|5}} {{frac|2|5}} {{frac|3|5}} {{frac|4|5}} {{frac|6}} {{frac|5|6}}  {{frac|7}} {{frac|2|7}} {{frac|3|7}} {{frac|4|7}} {{frac|5|7}} {{frac|6|7}} {{frac|8}} {{frac|2|8}} {{frac|3|8}} {{frac|4|8}} {{frac|5|8}} {{frac|6|8}} {{frac|7|8}} {{frac|16}} {{frac|3|16}} {{frac|5|16}} {{frac|7|16}} {{frac|9|16}} {{frac|11|16}} {{frac|13|16}} {{frac|15|16}} {{frac|5|32}} {{frac|27|32}}

== External Link Piper bot ==

Is there a bot that can pipe external links? All the external links in [[Messier Index]] need to be piped. There are around 1500 of them across ~100 pages! [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 19:57, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

You'll need to clarify.  Normally you use pipes for internal links and don't use them for external links. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 20:12, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

Note that wikibooks aspire to be self-contained.  Pages transwikied from Wikipedia should mostly be dewikified, delinking them (which, BTW, is a lot easier than piping).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 21:45, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

:As you are speaking in general term. I state my objection to this view, the level of links should be reduced and I agree to the aspiration to be self-contained but dewikified pages, lose lots of useful and relevant information. Automation dewikified, delinking upon request is fine but should not be assumed as a default.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:48, 2 July 2010 (UTC) 

Well, it is easier to have a bot pipe them all, then to manually delink them. We can't just take out all external links, some are needed. It would be helpful to have the external links. Like I said, there are about 1500 links across about 100 pages. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 23:35, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

On second thought, we could rewrite the whole thing. That would make it much better and get it featured status probably. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 23:38, 2 July 2010 (UTC)
== Improv Acting ==

Can we try and open up the section on games i only know so many and would love to spread my knowledge of Improv
:What is Improv, and what exactly do you want to do about that? We do have coverage of games like chess, but if a book is used solely for gaming, or solely for tips on solving a video game etc, it will not be accepted. In any case consider opening an account first; it makes life easier.

== Splitting of pages ==

Could someone help me with splitting two pages? I'm asking because I assume that splitting a page requires to copy the edit history and discussions to the new pages. Specifically, I would like to split the page [[German/Level_I/Wie_hei%C3%9Ft_du%3F]] into [[German/Level_I/Wie_hei%C3%9Ft_du%3F_(1._Teil)]], [[German/Level_I/Wie_hei%C3%9Ft_du%3F_(2._Teil)]] and [[German/Level_I/Bitte_buchstabieren_Sie]]. Also, I would like to move parts of [[German/Level_I/Freizeit]] to a new page [[German/Level_I/Zeit]]. Thanks! --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 07:40, 4 July 2010 (UTC)
:As far as I am aware it is not possible to copy edit histories.  They may be merged or specific items may be removed, but there isn't a way to say duplicated pages and their edit histories (unless, of course, you have transwiki privledges at two wiki's.)  But under the current license you free to copy material from one page to another and place and simply place a link to the original page where the edit history may be found.  This may even be done simply thought the edit summary by saying something like &quot;Copying material from [[German/Level_I/Wie_hei%C3%9Ft_du%3F]]&quot;. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:59, 4 July 2010 (UTC)

::Oh, OK. At de.wikibooks.org they handle things a bit differently. (They argue that a link is insufficient because the linked page might be deleted at some point.) I looked into the German Wikibooks help, which suggests to use [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:Duesentrieb Duesentrieb's] Contributers Tool [http://toolserver.org/~daniel/WikiSense/Contributors.php] to generate  edit histories and/or a list of authors. I also checked en.wikipedia.org and they suggest to use certain template to avoid that the original page and page history are deleted [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Splitting]. But these templates are not available on en.wikibooks.org. Thus, I'll just link to the original page, include a list of authors, and leave some comments in the edit summaries of all pages. Thanks! --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 11:30, 4 July 2010 (UTC)

:::It's not that hard to bring in a template.  I've brought in [[Template:Copied]] for you to make this easier.  Personally, if I split a page, I just link to the permanent link for the page I'm splitting from.  This is usually within a book and from the root page, so if the root page is deleted, the subpage is going to be deleted too.  Thus the original history will always exist as long as the subpage exists.  Of course, if the book's subpages are merged with another book and the root is deleted, it's a problem.  Thus, when merging books, the edit histories of the root pages need to be merged as well. But, this is between subpages, so you've got the template now. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:00, 4 July 2010 (UTC)
== [[Wikijunior:Particles]] ==

I'm halfway through completing this book and I want comments and feedback from the community, especially since reader feedback is still under discussion. I want this to serve as a 'midway review' so that I can correct mistakes in the first half and be pointed at the right direction in the second. Any criticism made about the book will be greatly appreciated. Thanks [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 13:38, 28 June 2010 (UTC)
:I have made a few comments, but as I am not familiar with the first form physics curriculum I have a tendency to indroduce issues beyond the scope of the book. Generally I think the book is very promising, with a fresh, engaging style so I would encourage anyone with a knowledge of school physics to have a look at it. It would be a pity to undermine the author's confidence in their their own abilities or their teacher just because they only had feedback from one grumpy old codger!

== Can’t Upload A Screenshot ==

Hi.

I’ve signed in with my username, and successfully done some textual edits. But when I try to upload a screenshot so I can use it on a page, the upload-file link takes me to a different domain, commons.wikimedia.org, that doesn’t recognize my username. Yet when I try to create the account again on that domain, it says it’s “too similar” to an existing account. What do I do?

I have previously registered this same username at wikipedia.org, and I can successfully log in there.

[[User:Ldo|Ldo]] ([[User talk:Ldo|talk]]) 12:06, 10 July 2010 (UTC)
:Please ask this question at Wikimedia Commons, [[commons:COM:HD|here]]. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 13:36, 10 July 2010 (UTC)

I don't  know much about how the sites determine that a login name is too similar, but you could try merge your accounts at [[Special:MergeAccount]].  I suspect this should work provided someone doesn't have exactly the same account as  you at one of the other wiki's.  But I wouldn't count on it working. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:03, 10 July 2010 (UTC)

:An account was already [http://toolserver.org/~vvv/sulutil.php?user=Ldo registered at Wikipedia] and the account is not part of the unified login system.  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:06, 10 July 2010 (UTC)

Thanks to all those who offered help. I went through the account-merging page, but it found another account at vi.wikipedia.org that didn’t seem to be one of mine, and so it said the merging process was “incomplete”. However, I can now login to commons.wikimedia.org, and I was able to upload my screenshot and link to it from the wikibooks page. So all fine now.

== Reading room refactor ==

The barely-used &quot;feature requests&quot; reading room I renamed to &quot;proposals&quot; to broaden its scope.  I've moved several threads on this page to there.  This room is then free to be used for miscellaneous discussions that won't be overwhelmed with the drawn-out discussions that accompany proposals.  Please ensure that the proposals reading room is on your watchlists. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:15, 12 July 2010 (UTC)
:I don't agree with this. I think the general reading room should house all the important proposals that have project-wide impacts. The feature requests section, since it's mostly about MediaWiki stuff as I understand it, should stay as it is, like the technical village pump etc. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 01:03, 13 July 2010 (UTC)
::I don't agree with it either.  It is a major organizational change that should have been raised as an issue before the community '''beforehand'''; and even if consensus were then achieved to change things, which is by no means certain, I don't think this is what consensus would settle on.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 02:16, 13 July 2010 (UTC)
::That scope is too narrow.  The feature requests page was going unused (without archiving working we had a topic from January 2009 still on it) and nobody here is a MediaWiki developer to properly respond to requests, which, if not specific to Wikibooks in the form of a proposal, need to be filed at Bugzilla directly anyway.  Wikipedia and Wikinews have pages for proposals.  And Wikipedia and Wikinews even have an additional room for policy discussions. We've got an additional room in the form of the general assistance page over the administrative and technical assistance pages you'd see at other projects.  That's why people are using it as a help desk because it's not clear what differentiates it. The general reading room can be for miscellaneous topics.  It could even be called that like at other projects if it weren't for so many links to it.  Take a look at Wikinews and how they break their rooms down. And I should note that the rooms are more like discussion rooms rather than reading rooms. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:10, 13 July 2010 (UTC)
::Kayau, announcements in the general discussion area would still be necessary as to validate any proposal (per different policies and the general [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] guideline), so in that regard we are covered (&lt;s&gt;note that the guideline needs some updating&lt;/s&gt;&lt;sup&gt;done&lt;/sup&gt;). As for the &quot;The feature requests section&quot; I never read much of what goes there and the two or three times I made a post there it was ignored, so in general to me it wouldn't be a loss, but I would support you as to keep it going.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:13, 13 July 2010 (UTC)  
:::Adrigonla &amp;mdash; do you recognize that you should not have taken this action unilaterally, ''regardless'' of whether you are able to obtain retroactive approval of it?

::::I had good intentions and to me it was a simple broadening of the scope of an existing room and not a &quot;major organizational change&quot;.  Apparently I underestimated the resistance to change and had I not, I would have proposed it first.  Had I thought to introduce a new room or even delete one, I definitely would have done so. Nothing I've done can't be undone and the threads in the other room have had no additional replies at this point and can be moved back here if it's so desired. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 03:29, 13 July 2010 (UTC)

::::::We do have an issue about the visibility of (some) proposals (even when occurring on the general discussion area), the inconsistency on how they are presented and the format that sometimes promotes division, a centralized location isn't probably a bad idea we &lt;u&gt;already have&lt;/u&gt; a similar sort of place for policies and guidelines at [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines/Vote]] (probably needs a rename).
::::::I understand that most people like in real life don't particularly care about the political process unless it directly affects them, but having some extra ground rules an a dedicated space doesn't seem objectionable to me, if we want more participation and better understanding of the topics under discussion.

:::::::Three comments:
:::::::#RR/G was getting very cluttered, the page was taking ages to load sometimes and trying to respond to a comment mid-thread was also a pain. That last part isn't helped by this but might be by #3 below.
:::::::#The new page isn't listed on [[Wikibooks:Discussion index]], if it was then this wouldn't be as much of a problem. I think that page is bot-maintained so contacting whoever runs the bot is in order. I think the discussion index also needs to be made much more visible, I use it frequently because it makes multiple discussions on one page MUCH easier to follow than looking through RC or page histories. The page also isn't getting picked up by the IRC bot, not sure who maintains that either.
:::::::#Some of these larger proposals should probably get their own page anyway, although keeping the discussion index up with new subpages might be difficult. Perhaps (and this is venturing onto &quot;Proposal&quot; territory) a special category could be created and the bot would update the index from pages in that category. Once some of the longer discussions are subpaged they could also be sectioned (although not really anything preventing subsections from being used either) for easier following/navigation.
:::::::Overall I'm in support but (along with the unilateral &quot;resolution&quot; of a recent [[User_talk:Xerol#I acted on the merge and removed the Complex Analysis Handbook RfD|RfD]]) it seems that people are trying to jump the gun and subvert the discussion process more and more often.

::::::::That last bit was unnecessary, I was going to leave this on your talk page but since you are concerned about the formalisms, and me being extremely direct as I'm and taking exception on this last analysis you now promote on the events of the RfD, especially since you make the implication that it was a circumvention of the due process.
::::::::The act I made was well covered under the guidelines of a BeBold action you and Pi zero where given the chance and information required to object to my action, nothing was in secret or in collusion with others and I take full responsibility for it alone. More, I was free to execute the pending merge as you when putting it for VfD didn't object or removed the merge requests from the pages by acting as I did I respected all formalisms required and the action was valid, I can't predict the future so any escalation of the subject is uncalled-for and unprovoked but you by your own words above, presume bad faith. Hope that I made it now all clear and the subject can now be closed, if this drags on I will request community validation for my action, that was not unique nor innovative.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:36, 13 July 2010 (UTC)
:::::::::If you look at my comment on my own talk page I essentially agreed with the outcome, but the way it was carried out seemed, to me, a little bit short of reckless. As is the case here. I know a lot of things have been getting bogged down in discussion for ages so maybe we just need people to be &quot;too bold&quot; a couple of times just to get things done. In the case of the RfD the main part I objected to was the ''removal of the listing'' from the RfD page, because at that point in time (after the merge/delete) there wasn't any place for further discussion to occur, and it ended up on my talk page. If someone had gone to the RfD page in the brief period when it was removed and didn't look at the history, they wouldn't even have known there was potential discussion to be had. Thankfully it's a wiki and nearly everything is reversible, so no harm done, no bad feelings, and I was assuming good faith all along. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 05:48, 13 July 2010 (UTC)
::::::::Actually it seems that the discussion indices are already maintainable by the community, and the Proposals page was added to the index yesterday.

{{outdent|::::::::}}
Adrignola - I had no doubt of your good intentions.  I think it's major because it seems to me to be moving a hefty part of the most active reading room.

I agree that the old Feature requests room was rather useless, and that the old General room was so big that things would get lost in it.

The comparison with Wikinews can be tricky; for example we have three [edit: four?] &quot;assistance&quot; rooms to their one, but our Administrative assistance room corresponds to a page there that isn't called a water cooler at all; and we have non-reading-room pages similar to various water coolers or parts of water coolers, except that we tend to do almost all our discussing in the reading rooms anyway.  Having more reading rooms than water coolers, and making most of our pages of this sort reading rooms rather than calling them something else, may make sense for our circumstances.

It seems to me that in practice the old General reading room combined roughly the functions of three of Wikinews's water coolers:  Policy (&quot;to discuss existing and proposed policies&quot;), Proposals (&quot;to discuss new ideas and proposals that are not policy related&quot;), and Miscellaneous (&quot;discussions and questions which don't fit elsewhere&quot;).  Should we split the old General room into three along similar lines?  We'd probably want to use a different phrase to describe Miscellaneous, because with our larger number of rooms it's a bit tough to figure out what doesn't fit anywhere else, but it's possible we might still want to call it Miscellaneous.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 05:49, 13 July 2010 (UTC)

:For what it is worth (and I am already breaking a resolution to keep out of reading room discussions) I am have no strong feelings about the change, and I suppose I mildly support.  I am of the opinion that we are coming off of a low point in editors willing to take part in these kind of discussions.  Just a few weeks ago it seems that no one was even interesting in commenting on DDC and LOC classifications, which are also were a pretty major part of life here.  
: My point is that during such times the only way things get done is if someone (often Adrignola) steps forward and does it.  I think everyone agrees in hind sight discussion might have been a good idea.  But I don't think Adrignola should be blamed for not recognizing this a head of time. Probably a few months ago no one would have batted an eye, and he is just used to operating in that environment.  For what it is worth I don't like either the wikipedia scheme (mentioned by Kayau elsewhere) or the wikinews scheme.  I think, if anything, Projects could be merged into this room leaving us with &quot;General&quot;, &quot;Proposals&quot;, and &quot;Featured Books&quot;.

I think the name change is fine, but should of been discussed first. &quot;Feature requests&quot; may of been a source of confusion with the introduction of &quot;featured books&quot; awhile back.

== General Template cleanup ==

With the above templates on SoftwareVersions coming along I've had to do a fair bit of poking around to find some information on templates, and also stumbled upon some templates in rather poor shape. Once SoftwareVersions is done I'm going to get started on cleaning up some of the other templates. To facilitate this, I've created {{tl|AttentionTemplate}} and {{tl|AttentionTemplateDoc}} for templates in need of technical or documentation help respectively. If you see templates that might need some syntax edited (without breaking existing usage, of course) use {{tl|AttentionTemplate}}. If a template is lacking in documentation, use {{tl|AttentionTemplateDoc}}. A good documentation can go a long way towards getting certain templates into more common usage.

To get some discussion flowing, I think the first thing that needs work is [[Help:Templates]] and [[Help:Templates Overview]] - A merge notice is up on the latter, and there's also [[Help:Advanced templates]] which seems to be a small subset of [[mw:Help:Magic words]] (and I think we should simply link to that, perhaps providing a few local examples, from the main Help:Templates page). A VfD and merge request went on in ''December 2008'' so I think it's about time for something to be done. Honestly I think a good portion of Help:Templates Overview can just be axed and what little's left can just be folded into Help:Templates, which itself can be upgraded significantly. Or perhaps a refactor is in order: Help:Templates might cover ''creating'' and ''editing'' of templates while [[Wikibooks:Templates]] covers ''using'' them. [[Wikibooks:Templates]] should probably get a more visible link somewhere, I'd really like to fit it into [[Wikibooks:Maintenance]] somewhere as [[Wikibooks:Community Portal]] just has a very tiny link in the &quot;Help&quot; section (and note it's a link to the Wikibooks: page, not the Help: page).

Perhaps [[Wikibooks:Maintenance]] could get a &quot;Tools&quot; section including links to things like deletion policy, templates, Rf_ pages, and so on. I'm getting a bit ahead of myself here but trying to improve one thing just highlights the bad bits in everything else.

:My own personal long-term planning includes trying to refactor, clean up, and update pages in the help namespace.  I've brought in documentation for many templates that didn't have them so far and switched many fully-protected templates to use the /doc format to avoid protected edit requests for interwikis.  Your reference above to Help versus Wikibooks namespaces is exactly how it should be.  I've not been entirely happy about the community portal either, but that does link to the policies and Rf_ pages.  Adding those to [[Wikibooks:Maintenance]] will introduce redundancy. Both pages and [[Help:Contents]] are linked from the side navigation already as well. Finally, I'd ask what templates stood out.  I have to say that templates for tagging templates may result in people applying them and not &quot;noinclude&quot;ing them and make things worse. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:14, 16 July 2010 (UTC)

::Er, I didn't think about the &quot;noinclude&quot; thing. Yeah that could be an issue, unless there's a creative way to wrap it. They ''are'' really only intended for the use of experienced editors and their use should be very temporary. Perhaps then the best way to tag them is a {{tl|subst:whatever}} where {{tl|whatever}} just adds the category inside &quot;noinclude&quot;s.

I agree that help pages need improvement. In the past it was suggesting bringing in help from other projects, but frankly I think the help pages of other projects are just as unhelpful. I think encouraging people to add what they know, like is done with books, is the better way to go.

== Goodbye, So long, farewell and all that ==

The title is a pun on a famous math book, a bad pun. I am taking a wikibreak, for some undetermined amount of time.  Working here has increasingly become less fun.  While I love the project, the toll has been a bit much.  We have no formal ArbCom or real way to work out differences between editors when things become very heated. (And it is too small a project to hope an ArbCom would really work anyways.) I think my continual bickering is distracting and keeps other editors from improving the project.  So it is time to put everything on ice for a while.  This is at least one effective way to soothe tempers.  There are also some other more personal reasons I taking a wikibreak. And a slim chance I will not return.  Basically I have always said bad books keep away editors and I have to decide if that will become a self fulfilling prophecy in my case.  In the mean time, keep up the good work, it has been a lot of fun.

== Definition of OR and NPOV ==

I think we need a new definition of the word 'original research'. What defines original research? Take [[Happiness]] for example. I think it is OR because it '''reaches a new, and possibly biased conclusion with sources that do not mention such a conclusion'''. Or, consider we have a textbook with a nice joke. (Textbooks usually don't have jokes, but my school Maths book does. There's a question where we're supposed to caluculate where a girl will end up when she steps x steps to the left, y steps to the right, etc, etc. In the diagram the girl says she feels faint!) If the joke has never been published before, is that OR as well? This is pretty straightforward in Wikipedia as things like teaching people to be happy or joking around are out of WP's project scope. But what about in WB, which content policies are not as strict as most other projects?

Another thing to (re)consider is NPOV. Let's face it, most of the humanities textbooks in real life are biased. Every textbook writes Zhuge Liang as if he were a god, Xiang Yu as if he were mentally ill, and Qin Shihuangdi as if he were the devil. (Sorry to the Christian folks here.) Really, it's not evadable to have POVs in history books. Everyone describes Liu Bang as humble and Xiang Yu as arrogant. Describing historical characters with such adjectives is almost part of the course itself. Of course I am talking about my secondary school here and not about posh uni stuff. Now, a real example. Take [[Plato/Apology]]. Is it biased towards Plato? Or just presenting plain facts and letting the reader think about it?

So, something should be done about OR and NPOV. Thoughts?  [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 11:34, 17 July 2010 (UTC)

:Thank you for taking on the elephant in the room that no one else seemed to want to talk about. It's an issue that's been building up over quite some time. A good approach to the OR problem might be to do a couple of case studies, compare some of our material on WB to paper textbooks, and see what comes out of all that. I think the main problem is textbooks, for the most part, involve not just facts, like most WP articles, but prose explaining the facts and giving context to them. That prose is almost (by WP's definition) OR, and it can be an even bigger problem with certain subject areas. For example, writing conversational phrases for use in language books, or &quot;word problems&quot; in math books. Using conversations from existing language books just runs into tons of copyright issues, and the same with word problems.

:At the core of all of those things is verifiability. It should be acceptable on WB to write an original fictitious &quot;conversation&quot; between two speakers to illustrate certain vocabulary in a language book, as long as all of the words and their usage is commonly available knowledge to native speakers of the languages in question. What would not be acceptable is making up words, or in a borderline case, using exceptionally localised slang. Similarly in a calculus context one could use an example of a boat floating down a river that is flowing at a given rate to illustrate change in position over time as an application of a derivative, or it could be a car on a road, or a bird in the sky - the concept is the same regardless of the example used, and if you take the specific objects out of the text it becomes harder for the reader to identify with the example. There's only really two options in any of these cases: use an example that's already been done before, running into possible copyvio issues, or &quot;make up&quot; an example which runs into OR issues.

:Although, I think the main issue is that it's not even referred to as &quot;original research&quot; anywhere on [[WB:WIW]]. [[WB:OR]] redirects to [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks#Wikibooks is not a mirror or a text repository|this section]], and the only thing there that might be problematic is the wording of &quot;presenting original ideas&quot; which might include original examples. [[Wikibooks:Original research]] is '''not''' an official policy, and in fact hasn't had a significant change to its content since ''2007'', so I don't think that's going anywhere anytime soon. (Maybe it should.) [[Wikibooks:Original research#New or novel writing methods|This section]], even though it's not (yet) policy, does seem like it would cover some areas appropriate to this situation.

:I think in the end it ''does'' boil down to something similar to Wikipedia, in that as long as the ''ideas'' represented are ''verifiable'' in an ''academic context'' (since, after all, we're primarily about providing free textbooks that can be used in a classroom*) then how the ''text'' of the book is ''written'' shouldn't matter. [[Wikibooks:Original research#New or novel writing methods|That section of proposed policy]] is basically saying the same thing.

:I think everyone who's participating in discussions needs to, at least once a month, go back and take a look at what our policies actually are. I've seen a lot of references thrown around to &quot;policy says this&quot; when it doesn't actually say that. (Maybe not in those exact words, I'm not going to dig through archives to find specific examples of this, but this has been my interpretation of some discussions, especially on VfD.) If you actually read through [[WB:WIW]] you should take away the following:

:*We don't use either a ''standard'' or ''rigid'' definition of &quot;textbook&quot;.
:*Books don't necessarily need to be written for use in a classroom, so long as they are ''instructional'' in nature. The only explicit exception to this is video game guides.

:And aside from some finer points, ''which only come up on a case-by-case basis'', that's all that really needs to be known to decide what content is acceptable, '''except in the case of what a lot of people are calling &quot;OR&quot;'''. So I think that's the core of it, and I think it could simply be fixed by adding text to the &quot;What Wikibooks includes&quot; section along the lines of &quot;Wikibooks only includes '''verifiable''' information.&quot; (Maybe not use the word &quot;only&quot;.) WIW is deliberately kept brief, and I think anything that comes out of this discussion should keep it brief.

:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;small&gt;Maybe we're not entirely about that now but I seem to remember that being one of the primary reasons for creating Wikibooks in the first place.&lt;/small&gt; [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 12:31, 17 July 2010 (UTC)

== Software Books and software versions, Part 2 ==

{{Software sidebox|scope=section|name=Software Version Proposal|version=0.05|type=&lt;&lt;}}

:''Archived discussion [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2010/June#Software_Books_and_software_versions|here]].''
:''This discussion was moved from [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Proposals|Proposals]] due to a general acceptance of the need for something to be done.''

This didn't really get resolved previously (and now might be a pretty bad time to bring it back up, whatwith all the heated discussions going on above) but I still feel that there's something that needs to be done about the problem, and that there's a fairly easy solution hiding ''somewhere'' -- we just have to find it.

To summarise from before (numbered for reference later):
#Books about computer software run into problems when said software is under active development and either minor or major releases come out.
#It's ''rarely'' clear in existing books what version of the software they pertain to.
#When software is updated, features may be:
##Unchanged
##Changed in implementation but not in usage
##Changed in usage but not in implementation
##Completely re-worked
#Item #3 leads to a potential problem of a book being partially updated to a new version, often just on a single page that a random editor might find and 'correct', not realising the remainder of the book is about a partly or completely different version of the software.
#Any of the &quot;obvious&quot; solutions require a lot of work just to put into place, not to mention near-constant vigilance of updates to both the book and the software. Most books are not lucky enough to have such a dedicated individual or group simply for maintenance.

The old proposal went something like this (summarised):
*Major differences in version (i.e. full releases, mainly applicable to commercial software) should probably get dedicated books.
*Minor differences/updates/patches should be handled by footnotes/sidebars/etc. where the bulk of the book is maintained to the current stable version (or whatever version the authors decide to keep up with).
*Books should clearly state what version of the software the book, pages, and sections apply to.

I'm actually happier with this now that I look back on it and re-word it a bit. Obviously adherence to this is going to be up to the individual book maintainers and, as always, clearly communicating the guidelines to a random editor is going to be a challenge. The bulk of the work is on the initial charge, which could possibly just be handled with a TOC-template update for each book. Possible ways that could work: Color the links differently for outdated versions; add some kind of template logic to display a message box if a page hasn't been updated; and of course to satisfy the third provision of the proposal just add the version of the software that the book aspires to be a guide to somewhere in the template.

I think my previous qualms were simply because of wanting to keep fully fleshed-out pages for every semi-major release of a piece of software, but the majority of changes are generally going to be either minor enough to be handled in a sidebar/footnote, or major enough to warrant a new book. I think by throwing out my original desires the whole idea becomes a lot more desirable and, perhaps most importantly, maintainable.

So, here we go, round 2, '''guideline proposal''': 
:''&lt;small&gt;My notes/rationale in small text&lt;/small&gt;''
:''&lt;s&gt;Things I want to include but might be going too far for an initial proposal are in strikeout&lt;/s&gt;''
#Books about computer software should make clear the following:
#*What the current version of the software is ''in the context of the book''. &lt;small&gt;(This would usually be the most recent stable release, but may be different for whatever reason. Essentially, what version this book is intended to be a guide to.)&lt;/small&gt;
#*On each page, what version of the software the text applies to. If the text applies to multiple versions, make clear the version each section applies to. &lt;s&gt;If the differences are minor, explain the difference in a sidebox or footnote. If the differences are major, separate sections or even pages may be more appropriate. If there are many major differences, consider forking to a new book.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;small&gt;(Basically need to come up with a better wording for the struck-out section: The idea is to make it ''as clear as possible'' to the ''reader'' what version is being referred to. I just don't like the idea of specifying exactly how to organize a theoretical generic software WikiBook.)&lt;/small&gt;
#The book should have a well-defined method for clearly identifying what text pertains to what version of the software. Consider placing this information in the book's navigation template(s), or conveying it via infoboxes placed on each page. &lt;small&gt;(Once again don't want to '''tell''' people what to do, this is a guideline after all, but some suggestions might be helpful.)&lt;/small&gt; In a visible location (such as an &quot;About this Book&quot; page), explain ''to the reader'' how to determine what pages/parts of pages apply to which versions (consistent with each individual book's choice of style), and ''to the editors'' how to keep the book maintained. &lt;small&gt;(Simple enough. I hope.)&lt;/small&gt;

Overall this is pretty generic (maybe too generic) but I wanted to leave it open enough (even though it would only be a ''guideline'' to begin with) for the maintainers of the larger books, and of new books, and even new maintainers of old books, to decide what they want to do for themselves, because what works well for one book might not work at all in another book.

When leaving comments and possible changes/amendments on this proposal please consider whether you're commenting on the ''wording'' or the ''meaning'' of the proposal, or possibly where the ''wording affects the meaning'' because I'm not perfect with words.

::::::Regarding comments, won't the use of '=' in a #switch: template parameter screw things up? I don't see any particular use for &lt; and &gt; so perhaps using them equivalently to ≤ and ≥ to make for easier use would be appropriate: Use &lt; for any version up to and including the specified one, &gt; for any version including and after, and = for a specific one. Perhaps even = to specify a generic version family ('''2.x''') and == for a specific version ('''2.1.38'''). Those last two could be used in cases where a whole page applies to any version 2.x, while specific sections refer to 2.1.x and 2.1.38. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 20:53, 15 July 2010 (UTC)
::::::: A '=' can be used, you just have to work around its special meaning. In my template though I ended up deciding that using equal to as the default would be easier for most people. I thought using both &quot;≥&quot; and &quot;≤&quot; would make understanding what versions apply clearer in cases of minor versions, as well as when what is described applies both to the version and either all later or previous versions. You could do something like &quot;&gt; 2.1&quot; when you mean version 2.2 and later. However some software continues to develop along multiple version lines, so what would happen when &quot;2.1.1&quot; comes out? &quot;2.1.1&quot; is be greater than &quot;2.1&quot;, so the template might no longer mean what was intended, and that could go unnoticed. If &quot;≥&quot; and &quot;≤&quot; are an issue &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; could perhaps be used instead? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 03:36, 16 July 2010 (UTC)

Some possible future changes:
*Allow use of a custom image
*Custom width on header version
*Custom colors

:There's two main reasons that I can think of off the top of my head, and I'm sure there's others that will be mentioned:
:#One subject can be covered by multiple books, in different styles. If someone were to just write a straight-up manual on Blender, that would still be acceptable. 
:#Wikibooks is not Wikipedia. These are books, and just because they're textbooks doesn't mean they can't have interesting titles. Sure, it makes organizing and cataloging them a bit more of a task but the title is likely the first thing a reader is going to see about a book (or the cover image).

I'd like to combine [[Blender 3D: HotKeys]] with [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro]]. There exists a link to the hotkeys on the B3D NTP table of contents [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Hotkeys]] that seems to go thru a redirect to arrive at the hotkeys book .

So is it just a simple move of &quot;Blender 3D: HotKeys&quot;, to &quot;Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/HotKeys&quot; and somehow removing the redirect from some special table in wikibooks? [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 12:35, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

There are 23 subpages of [[Blender 3D: HotKeys]] that would have to be moved and links to them fixed.

The '''trucker's hitch''', also known as the '''power cinch''', is a self-binding knot commonly used for securing loads on trucks or trailers.

There are several variations of the knot, all of which use a loop in the standing part of the rope as a make-shift pulley in order to theoretically obtain a 3:1 [[w:mechanical advantage|mechanical advantage]] when used in the typical way as shown. In practice they may only achieve a little more than a 1 to 1 advantage due to friction.

There are unsafe variations of this knot in common use. Because loads falling off of trucks can well cause injuries and deaths, such unsafe versions should not be taught or used. One is the version based on the [[Knots/Seizing knots/Sheepshank|sheepshank]], which can simply fall apart under too little or too much load. Another common variation forms a loop by twisting the rope three times into an eye and pulling the rope through the eye to make a loop; the loop formed in that version is a kind of slipped loop, and the unbalanced load on the loop can cause the loop to be pulled smaller and thereby allow the load to come loose. A reliable version often used is based on the [[Knots/Loop knots/Directional figure eight|directional figure eight]] loop. An apparently secure and possibly easier to untie version might be made from a [[Knots/Loop knots/Bowline|bowline]] loop, but the end of the rope would need to be available to tie a bowline version.

[[File:TruckersHitchUsingAlpineButterflyAndSlippedDoubleHalfHitch.jpg|thumb|right|Trucker's hitch finished with a slipped double half hitch.]]

== Tying ==
# Tie an [[Knots/Loop knots/Alpine butterfly|Alpine butterfly loop]] on the standing end.
# Put the end through the load and then through the loop.
# Pull tight.
# Tie [[../Two half hitches|two half hitches]], usually [[w:slipped loop|slipped]] for easy releasing, though a more secure finish may be called for. Whatever knot is used to secure the end to the loop, it should be kept in mind that when it is time to untie the knot, the knot will typically still be under load. Many knots are extremely difficult to untie under load. Even a half hitch may be challenging to untie even after the slipped second half hitch is pulled out.

== Advantages ==
* Can be tied anywhere in the standing part of the line
* Works like a pair of pulleys, providing up to 3:1 mechanical advantage in tensioning
* Multiple hitches can be cascaded, giving 5:1 (theoretical) and higher mechanical advantage

== Mechanical advantage ==
There is often confusion about how much [[w:mechanical advantage|mechanical advantage]] is provided by the trucker's hitch. For example, when used like in this pulley diagram, such as if the rope above the Trucker's hitch were tied to a rafter in the ceiling, and a weight were being lifted off the floor, the advantage would only 2:1 instead of 3:1. Notice that even though the 400&amp;nbsp;lb force holding up the weight in the diagram is two times the 200&amp;nbsp;lb pull on the end of the rope, the rope from the rafter to the upper pulley must resist both the load weight and the downward pull on the rope end. Thus, the tension in the upper rope would be three times higher than the pull on the rope end. In the more common use of the trucker's hitch, the lower pulley is a hook or ring on the rail of a truck, and the rope across the top of the load has a tension three times the pull on the end. When the end is secured to the loop of the trucker's hitch with a pair of half hitches and let go, the tension in the two segments of rope around the ring will rise 50%, to 300&amp;nbsp;lb each.

      <comment>/* Exercise 24 */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Section 3.1 - Random Variables ==

=== Exercise 1 ===
Let &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; be the number of beams that failed due to shear (S).  Three beams are sampled, and they will fail either from shear (S) or from flexure (F).  The sample space is: &lt;math&gt; S = {SSS, SSF, SFS, SFF, FSS, FSF, FFS, FFF}. &lt;/math&gt;

The random variable maps to the sample space as:

* &lt;math&gt; X = 0:\ FFF  &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; X = 1:\ SFF,\ FSF,\ FFS &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; X = 2:\ FSS,\ SFS,\ SSF &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; X = 3:\ SSS &lt;/math&gt;

=== Exercise 2 ===
Three examples of Bernoulli random variables:

* Toss a coin once, let a success be having a the coin lands heads up.  &lt;math&gt; X = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{head} \\ 0 &amp; \text{tails} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;
* Ask credit card users if their primary card is Visa or Mastercard.  &lt;math&gt; X = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{Visa} \\ 0 &amp; \text{Mastercard} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;
* Inspecting pennies in a coin collection for steel pennies.  &lt;math&gt; X = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{steel penny} \\ 0 &amp; \text{copper penny} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Exercise 3 ===
Consider an Experiment in which the number of pumps in use at each of two gas stations was determined.  Define the random variables:

* &lt;math&gt;W = &lt;/math&gt; the number of pumps with a waiting line of vehicles waiting to fuel up.
* &lt;math&gt;Z = &lt;/math&gt; the number of pumps providing both Diesel and Gasoline.

=== Exercise 4 ===
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be the number of nonzero digits in a randomly selected zip code.

&lt;math&gt; X = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{zip digits are: all zeros, e.g., 00000} \\
1 &amp; \text{zip digits are: 4 zero, 1 nonzero, e.g, 00100} \\
2 &amp; \text{zip digits are: 3 zeros, 2 nonzero, e.g., 10050} \\
3 &amp; \text{zip digits are: 2 zeros, 3 nonzero, e.g., 90210} \\
4 &amp; \text{zip digits are: 1 zero, 4 nonzero, e.g., 80223} \\
5 &amp; \text{zip digits are: 0 zeros, 5 nonzero, e.g., 76491} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;
 

=== Exercise 5 ===

Consider a sample space for the number of rolls of a set of dice until the sum of 2 is rolled.  Let &lt;math&gt; X = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{a sum of 2 is rolled before the 8th roll} \\
0 &amp; \text{a sum of 2 is not rolled until the 8th or later roll} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;.  In this case the random variable for mapping the sample space to the real numbers is no infinite, it is discrete and dichotomous.

=== Exercise 6 ===
&lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is the number of cars observed at an intersection until a car turns Left (&lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt;).  (Cars can turn right (&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;), left (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;) or go straight (&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;)).  

&lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; can take on the values 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., for example:


&lt;math&gt;X = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \{L\} \\
2 &amp; \{RL,\ AL\} \\
3 &amp; \{AAL,\ ARL,\ RAL,\ RRL\} \\
4 &amp; \{AAAL,\ AARL,\ ... \} \\
... \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

*'''Part e.''' Let &lt;math&gt; Z &lt;/math&gt; Royalties earned from the sale of the first 10,000 copies of a textbook.  For this question we will assume there is a standard royalty, $x, earned per book sold.

*'''Part h.''' Let &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; be the total number of tosses of coins for three people to get the same outcome, i.e., &lt;math&gt; HHH &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; TTT &lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is a discrete random variable and can take on the values 

&lt;math&gt; X \in \{3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Exercise 8 ===
Let &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt; be the total number of trails until you have three successes in a row.  &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt; will take on the values &lt;math&gt; 3, 4, 5, 6, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; Y = \begin{cases} 3 &amp; \{SSS\} \\
4 &amp; \{FSSS\} \\
5 &amp; \{SFSSS, FFSSS\} \\
6 &amp; \{SSFSSS, FFFSSS, SFFSSS, FSFSSS\}\\
7 &amp; \{SSFFSSS, SFSFSSS, SFFFSSS, FSSFSSS, FSFFSSS, FFSFSSS, FFFFSSS\} \\
\ldots \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;


=== Exercise 9 ===

*'''Part a.''' &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is the number of moves until Claudius returns back to 0.  &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is discrete and takes on the values &lt;math&gt; X \in \{2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots \} &lt;/math&gt;

*'''Part b.''' &lt;math&gt; X \in \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \ldots \} &lt;/math&gt;

== Section 3.2 - Probability Distributions for Discrete Random Variables ==

=== Exercise 11 === 
Let &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; be the number of cylinders on the next car to be serviced.

*'''Part a.''' The probability mass function of &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is: 

&lt;math&gt; P(X = x) = \begin{cases} 0.45 &amp; x = 4 \\ 0.40 &amp; x = 6 \\ 0.15 &amp; x = 8 \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise}\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

*'''Part b.''' 

*'''Part c.''' &lt;math&gt; P(X \geq 6) = P(X = 6) + P(X = 8) = 0.40 + 0.15 = 0.55 &lt;/math&gt;


=== Exercise 12 ===
Let &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt; be the number of ticketed passengers who show up for a flight.

*'''Part a.''' The probability the flight will accommodate all ticketed passengers who show is:

&lt;math&gt; P(Y \leq 50) = \sum_{y = 45}^{50} P(Y = y) = 0.83 &lt;/math&gt;

*'''Part b.''' The probability that not all ticketed passengers who show up for the flight will get a seat on the plane:

&lt;math&gt; P(Y &gt; 50) = 1 - P(Y \leq 50) = 1 - 0.83 = 0.17 &lt;/math&gt;

*'''Part c.''' The probability the first person on standby will get on the flight is: 

&lt;math&gt; P(Y \leq 49) = \sum_{y = 45}^{49} P(Y = y) = 0.66 &lt;/math&gt;

The probability the third person on standby gets on the flight is:

&lt;math&gt; P(Y \leq 47) = \sum_{x=45}^{47} P(Y = y) = 0.27 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Exercise 13 ===

Let &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; be the number of phone lines (out of six total lines) in use at any one time in the office.  Using the given probability mass function:

*'''Part a.''' The probability of at most three lines in use is: 

&lt;math&gt; P(X \leq 3) = \sum_{x=0}^3 P(X = x) = 0.10 + 0.15+0.20+0.25 = 0.70 &lt;/math&gt;

*'''Part b.''' The probability of fewer than three lines in use is:

&lt;math&gt; P(X &lt; 3) = \sum_{x=0}^2 P(X = x) = 0.10 + 0.15+0.20 = 0.45 &lt;/math&gt;

*'''Part c.''' The probability at least three lines are in use is:

&lt;math&gt; P(X \geq 3) = 1 - P(X &lt; 3) = 1 - 0.45 = 0.55 &lt;/math&gt;

*'''Part d.''' The probability between two and five lines, inclusive, are in use is:

&lt;math&gt; P(2 \leq X \leq 5) = \sum_{x=2}^5 P(X = x) = 0.20+0.25+0.20+0.06 = 0.71 &lt;/math&gt;

*'''Part e.''' The probability between two and four lines, inclusive, are not in use is:

&lt;math&gt; P(6 - X \geq 2 \text{ or } 6 - X \leq 4) = P(X \leq 4 \text{ or } X \geq 2) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) = 0.2+0.25+0.2 = 0.65 &lt;/math&gt;

*'''Part f.''' The probability of at least four lines are not in use is:

&lt;math&gt; P(6-X \geq 4) = P(X \leq 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = 0.10 + 0.15+0.2 = 0.45 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Exercise 14 ===
Let &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt; be the number of forms the contractor needs to submit.

=== Exercise 45. ===
If &lt;math&gt; a \leq X \leq b &lt;/math&gt; then show &lt;math&gt; a \leq E(X) \leq b &lt;/math&gt;.

Intuitively, we can consider the expectation to be the center of mass of the random variable.  So if the mass of the random variable is between &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt;, then the center of mass, the expectation, will also be between &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt;.

The proof is easy.  You'll need to remember that &lt;math&gt; \sum_x P(X = x) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcccl}
a &amp;\leq&amp; X &amp;\leq&amp; b \\
\sum_x a P(X = x) &amp;\leq&amp; \sum_x x P(X = x) &amp;\leq&amp; \sum_x b P(X = x) \\
a \sum_x P(X = x) &amp;\leq&amp; E(X) &amp;\leq&amp; b \sum_x P(X = x) \\
a &amp;\leq&amp; E(X) &amp;\leq&amp; b

*'''Part c.''' If we examine the goblets one by one, find the probability at most five are examined to fine four that are not flawed.  To do this think about the situation, if we need to find four without flaws then we need to sample at least four.  

: If we sample four then all four need to be flawless.  Call this event &lt;math&gt; A. &lt;/math&gt;
: If we sample five, then the first four sampled need to have a three flawless and one flawed and the fifth goblet sampled needs to be flawless.  Call this event &lt;math&gt; B. &lt;/math&gt; (If the first four all were flawless we wouldn't have to sample a fifth time.)  So we have the following:

: Let &lt;math&gt; Y \sim \text{Binomial}\left(n = 4, p = 0.90\right) &lt;/math&gt; be the number of flawless goblets in a sample of size 4. 

:&lt;math&gt; P(A) = P(Y = 4) = \binom{4}{4}\left(0.90\right)^4\left(1-0.10\right)^{4-4} = 0.6561 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; P(B) = P(Y = 3) \times 0.10 = \left(\binom{4}{3}\left(0.90\right)^3\left(1-0.10\right)^{4-3} \right)\times 0.10 = 2.6244 \times 0.10 = 0.26244 &lt;/math&gt;

: and the total probability for sampling at most five goblets to get four flawless ones is:
: &lt;math&gt; P\left(A\right) + P\left(B\right) = 0.6561 + 0.26244 = 0.91854 &lt;/math&gt;

*'''Part c.''' If there are 15 new copies and 15 used copies in stock, what is the probability everyone of the 25 people coming into the store will be happy?  To solve this we need to think about the number of people coming in for a new book and how many that leaves wanting a used book.  If, for example, 9 people come in wanting a new book then we can accommodate them, but this leaves 25 - 9 = 16 wanting a used book and there is not enough used books in stock to meet this need.  It is easy to see if fewer than 9 people come in wanting a new book the same problem exists; there will not be enough used books.  However, if there are 10 people who come in looking for a new book then we will have enough new books and 25 - 10 = 15 will want a used book and we have enough stock to meet both needs.  Consider &lt;math&gt; X = \{10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\} &lt;/math&gt; will result in having enough used and new books to meet the needs of the customers.

: &lt;math&gt; h\left(X\right) = 100X + 70(25 - X) = 1750 + 30X &lt;/math&gt;

To solve this think about what needs to happen for the stock in the store to meet the needs of the customers.  If &lt;math&gt; X = 3 &lt;/math&gt; then there are three people getting the oversize version and this leaves 7 to get the normal size version.  If only two people wanted the oversize version then there would not be enough of the normal size rackets in stock to satisfy the 8 people who would want the normal size racket.  It is easy to see the max for &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is 7, any more and there would not be enough oversize versions in stock.

=== Exercise 55. ===  
Note: There are two solution methods presented here.  The first is a little more complex than needed, but is a good way to illustrate several concepts in probability.

We are told that 20% of all telephones of a certain type will be submitted for service under warranty.  Of the telephones submitted for service 60% are repaired and 40% are replaced.  If we by 10 telephones of this type, what is the probability that exactly 2 will be replaced under warranty?

Start with defining some random variables.  Let &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; be the number of phones submitted for service.  Let &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt; be the number of telephones which are replaced after being submitted for service.  We have some conditional probabilities here and will need to use the law of total probability to find the final answer.

We have the following distributions:

&lt;math&gt; X \sim \text{Binomial}\left(n_x = 10, p_x = 0.20\right) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; R | X \sim \text{Binomial}\left( n_r = X, p_r = 0.40\right) &lt;/math&gt;

Use the law of total probability to find the answer.  Note that the first two probabilities in the sum are both zero, i.e., it is not possible to have &lt;math&gt; R = 2 &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; X = 0 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; X = 1 &lt;/math&gt;.
 
&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rcl}
P(R = 2) &amp;=&amp; P(R = 2 | X = 0)P(X=0) + P(R = 2 | X = 1)P(X = 1) \\
          &amp;&amp; + P(R = 2 | X = 2)P(X=2) + P(R=2 | X = 3)P(X=3) + \cdots \\
          &amp;&amp; + P(R = 2 | X = 10) P(X=10) \\
 &amp;=&amp; \sum_{x=2}^{10} P\left(R = 2 | X = x\right) P\left( X = x\right) \\
 &amp;=&amp; \sum_{x=2}^{10} \underbrace{\binom{x}{2}\left(p_r\right)^2\left(1 - p_r\right)^{x-2}}_{P(R=2|X=x)} \underbrace{\binom{10}{x} \left(p_x\right)^x\left(1-p_x\right)^{10-x}}_{P(X = x)} \\
 &amp;=&amp; 0.1478070
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Now that you've seen this solution, there is another way to do this that is alot easier.  Look at the probability that a telephone is replaced.  Again, use the law of total probability.

&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rcl}
P(\text{replaced}) &amp;=&amp; P(\text{replaced} | \text{submitted}) \times P(\text{submitted}) \\ &amp;&amp; + P(\text{replaced} | \text{not submitted}) \times P(\text{not submitted}) \\
 &amp;=&amp; 0.40 \times 0.20 + 0 \times 0.80 \\
 &amp;=&amp; 0.08
\end{array} &lt;/math&gt;

Now, let &lt;math&gt; W &lt;/math&gt; be the number of telephones replaced under warranty.

&lt;math&gt; W \sim \text{Binomial}\left(n = 10, p = 0.08\right) &lt;/math&gt;

and the probability that 2 telephones are replaced is:

&lt;math&gt; P(W = 2) = \binom{10}{2}\left(0.08\right)^2 \left(1 - 0.08\right)^{10-2} = 0.1478070 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Exercise 56. ===
Let &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; be the number of students who receive special accommodations.  

&lt;math&gt; X \sim \text{Binomial}\left( n = 25, p = 0.02 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

*'''Part a.''' The probability exactly one received special accommodations?

:&lt;math&gt; P(X = 1) = \binom{25}{1} 0.02^1 (1 - 0.02)^{25-1} = 0.3078902 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Exercise 57. ===
We know that any one battery will have acceptable voltage with probability 0.90.  A flashlight requires two batteries of acceptable voltage to work.  If we assume that the batteries are independent the probability the batteries in a flashlight are acceptable is &lt;math&gt; 0.90 \times 0.90 = 0.81 &lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; be the number of working flashlights in a sample of size &lt;math&gt; n = 10 &lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; X \sim \text{Binomial}\left(n = 10, p = 0.81\right) &lt;/math&gt;

The probability at least nine of the ten flashlights will work is:

&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rcl}
P\left( X \geq 9 \right) &amp;=&amp; P(X = 9) + P(X = 10) \\
 &amp;=&amp; \binom{10}{9}\left(0.81\right)^{9} \left( 1 - 0.81 \right)^{10-9} + 
     \binom{10}{10}\left(0.81\right)^{10} \left( 1 - 0.81 \right)^{10-10} \\
 &amp;=&amp; 0.2852 + 0.1216 \\
 &amp;=&amp; 0.4068
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Exercise 58. ===
Let &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; be the number of defective components.

&lt;math&gt; X \sim \text{Binomial}\left(n = 10, p\right) &lt;/math&gt;

Find the probability the batch is accepted given the different success probabilities &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.
		
&lt;math&gt; P(X \leq 2) = \begin{cases} 0.9998862 \approx 0.9999 &amp; p = 0.01 \\															   0.9884964 \approx 0.9885 &amp; p = 0.05 \\
0.9298092 \approx 0.9298 &amp; p = 0.10 \\
0.6777995 \approx 0.6778 &amp; p = 0.20 \\
0.5255928 \approx 0.5256 &amp; p = 0.25 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Ch03ex0058.png]]

The sampling plan which maximizes the acceptance for &lt;math&gt; p &lt; 0.10 &lt;/math&gt; and minimizes the acceptance for &lt;math&gt; p &gt; 0.10 &lt;/math&gt; is the best option. Of the three methods suggested, it appears that method d, sampling 15 and accepting if less than 2 are defective is the best call. The ideal case would be having a step function with probability 1 of acceptance for &lt;math&gt; p &lt; 0.10 &lt;/math&gt; and probability 0 of acceptance for &lt;math&gt; p \geq 0.10&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Exercise 59. ===
This exercise is a prelude to hypothesis testing in the later chapters.  In this case we have 

&lt;math&gt; X \sim \text{Binomial}\left( n = 25, p \right) &lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is an unknown value.  We will reject the claim of &lt;math&gt; p \geq 0.80 &lt;/math&gt; if we observe &lt;math&gt; X \leq 15 &lt;/math&gt;.

*'''Part a.''' What is the probability that the claim is rejected if the true value is &lt;math&gt; p = 0.80 :&lt;/math&gt;.  This is what is called a Type I Error, rejecting the claim when it is true.  In this case we have a probability of rejecting the claim if &lt;math&gt; X \leq 15 &lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt; P(X \leq 15) = \sum_{x=0}^{15} \binom{25}{x} \left(p\right)^{x} \left(1 - p\right)^{25-x} = 0.01733187 &lt;/math&gt;.

*'''Part b.''' What is the probability of not rejecting the claim when 

:&lt;math&gt; p = 0.7 &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; 1 - P(X \leq 15) = \sum_{x=0}^{15} \binom{25}{x} \left(p\right)^{x} \left(1 - p\right)^{25-x} = 1-0.1894360  = 0.810564&lt;/math&gt;.

:or 

:&lt;math&gt; p = 0.6 &lt;/math&gt;.  
::&lt;math&gt; P(X \leq 15) = \sum_{x=0}^{15} \binom{25}{x} \left(p\right)^{x} \left(1 - p\right)^{25-x} = 1 - 0.575383 = 0.424617 &lt;/math&gt;.

:Note: the probabilities here are also error, failure to reject the claim when it is false.  These are known as Type II errors.  You'll learn more about this in later chapters of this book on Hypothesis testing.

*'''Part c.''' How do the error probabilities change in the above if the rejection of the claim is done when &lt;math&gt; X \leq 14 &lt;/math&gt;?
**for part a: the probability is 0.00555492
**for part b: with &lt;math&gt; p = 0.7 &lt;/math&gt; the probability is 0.9022
**for part b: with &lt;math&gt; p = 0.6 &lt;/math&gt; the probability is 0.585775

=== Exercise 60. ===
Let &lt;math&gt; h(X) &lt;/math&gt; be the function for the total revenue from a total of &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; passenger cars. 

&lt;math&gt; X \sim \text{Binomial}\left(n = 25, p = 0.60 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rcl}
h(X) &amp;=&amp; 1.00 X + 2.5 \times (25 - X) \\
 &amp;=&amp; 62.5 - 1.5 X \\ \\
E(h(X)) &amp;=&amp; 62.5 - 1.5 E(X) \\
 &amp;=&amp; 62.5 - 1.5 np \\
 &amp;=&amp; 62.5 - 1.5 \times 25 \times 0.60 \\
 &amp;=&amp; 40.00
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

The expected revenue of for 25 vehicles over the toll bridge is $40.00.

=== Exercise 61. ===
Let &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; be the number of books received if the student writes on topic A.  Let &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt; be the number of books received if the student writes on topic B.

&lt;math&gt; A \sim \text{Binomial}\left( n = 2 , p \right) \quad B \sim \text{Binomial}\left( n = 4, p  \right) &lt;/math&gt;

if &lt;math&gt; p = 0.9 &lt;/math&gt; then the probability of having at least half of the books ordered received is

&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rcl}
P(A \geq 1) &amp;=&amp; 0.99 \\
P(B \geq 2) &amp;=&amp; 0.9963
\end{array} &lt;/math&gt;

The probability of getting at least half of the ordered books for Topic B is slightly higher than for Topic A and thus Topic B should be selected.

If the success probability for receiving a book is reduced from 0.90 to 0.50 the probabilities are:

&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rcl}
P(A \geq 1) &amp;=&amp; 0.75 \\
P(B \geq 2) &amp;=&amp; 0.6875
\end{array} &lt;/math&gt;

In this case the probability of getting at least half of the ordered books is higher for Topic A than B and Topic A should be selected.

=== Exercise 62. ===
Let &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; be a binomial random variable.  For a fixed value of &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; is there a value of &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; that will allow the variance to be zero?  It turns out that there are two possible values for &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; that will allow the variance to be zero.  

&lt;math&gt; Var(X) = np(1-p) = 0 \quad \text{if } p = 0 \text{ or } 1. &lt;/math&gt;

This should make sense.  If the success probability is 0 then the out come of the experiment will be all failures, all the values are the same and the variance, a measure of spread, is zero since the spread of the data is zero.  Same if the success probability is 1, all the outcomes are success, there is no spread in the data.

To maximize the variance we need a value of &lt;math&gt; p = 1/2 &lt;/math&gt;.  Here is the proof:

&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rcl}
\frac{\partial}{\partial p} Var(X) &amp;=&amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial p} np(1-p) \\
 &amp;=&amp; n(1-p) - np \\
 &amp;=&amp; n - np - np  \\
 &amp;=&amp; n - 2np \\
 \text{set  } n - 2np &amp;=&amp; 0 \\
 p &amp;=&amp; 1/2 \\ \\
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial p^2} Var(X) &amp;=&amp; -2n &lt; 0
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the second derivative is less than zero for all values of &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; we know that when the first derivative is zero that we will have a maximum.  The maximum is when &lt;math&gt; p = 1/2 &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Exercise 63. ===
*'''Part a.''' Show that &lt;math&gt; b(x;n, 1-p) = b(n-x;n,p) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl}
b(x;n, 1-p) &amp;=&amp; b(n-x;n,p) \\
\binom{n}{x}\left(1-p\right)^x\left(1-(1-p)\right)^{n-x} &amp;=&amp; \binom{n}{n-x} \left(p\right)^{n-x} \left(1 - p\right)^{n - (n-x)} \\
\frac{n!}{x! (n-x)!} \left(1-p\right)^x \left(p\right)^{n-x} &amp;=&amp; \frac{n!}{(n-x)!(n-(n-x))!} \left(p\right)^{n-x} (1-p)^{x} \\
\frac{n!}{x! (n-x)!} \left(p\right)^{n-x} \left(1-p\right)^x &amp;=&amp; \frac{n!}{(n-x)!x!} \left(p\right)^{n-x} (1-p)^{x} 
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

The functions are the same.

*'''Part b.''' Show that the CDF for a binomial with &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; trials and success probability &lt;math&gt; 1 - p &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; B(x; n,1-p) &lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;1 - B(n-x-1;n,p) &lt;/math&gt;

To do this define another random variable &lt;math&gt; Y = n - X &lt;/math&gt;.  The distributions are:

&lt;math&gt; X \sim \text{Binomial}\left( n , 1-p\right) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; Y \sim \text{Binomial}\left( n, p \right) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rcl}
B(x; n,1-p) &amp;=&amp; P(X \leq x) \\
 &amp;=&amp; 1 - P(X &gt; x) \\
 &amp;=&amp; 1 - P(n - Y &gt; x) \\
 &amp;=&amp; 1 - P(Y &lt; n - x ) \\
 &amp;=&amp; 1 - P(Y \leq n - x - 1) \\
 &amp;=&amp; 1 - B(n-x-1; n, p)
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

*'''Part c.''' The above two parts imply that in the Binomial probability tables in the back of the textbook, it is not necessary to publish the value for the success probability &lt;math&gt; p &gt; 0.50 &lt;/math&gt; because you can find the needed probabilities using the failure probability &lt;math&gt; 1-p &lt;/math&gt; which will be less than &lt;math&gt; 0.50 &lt;/math&gt; when ever &lt;math&gt; p &gt; 0.50 &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Exercise 64. ===
Prove the expectation of a binomial random variable is &lt;math&gt; E(X) = np &lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rcll}

E(X) &amp;=&amp; \sum_{x=0}^n x P(X=x) \\
 &amp;=&amp; \sum_{x=0}^n x \binom{n}{x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x} \\ \\
 &amp;=&amp; \sum_{x=0}^n x \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!} p^x (1-p)^{n-x} &amp; \text{the x=0 term in the sum will be 0,} \\
 &amp;&amp; &amp; \text{so we can change the index on the sum} \\ \\
 &amp;=&amp; \sum_{x=1}^n x \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!} p^x (1-p)^{n-x} \\ \\
 &amp;=&amp; \sum_{x=1}^n \frac{n!}{(x-1)!(n-x)!} p^x (1-p)^{n-x} &amp; \text{move the index back to zero}\\ \\
 &amp;=&amp; \sum_{x=0}^{n-1} \frac{n!}{x!(n - (x+1))!} p^{x+1} (1-p)^{n-(x+1)} \\ \\
 &amp;=&amp; np \sum_{x=0}^{n-1} \underbrace{\frac{(n-1)!}{x!(n-1-x)!} p^x (1-p)^{n-1-x}}_{\text{pmf of Binomial(n-1,p)}} &amp; \text{the sum of the pmf = l}\\ \\
 &amp;=&amp; np
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Exercise 65. ===
*'''Part a.''' Let &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; be the number of people who pay with a debit card.

:&lt;math&gt; X \sim \text{Binomial}\left(n = 100, p = 0.2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

:The expectation and variance is:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rcccl}
E(X) &amp;=&amp; np &amp;=&amp; 20 \\
Var(X) &amp;=&amp; np(1-p) &amp;=&amp; 16
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

:The reasoning here, which is only in defining the random variable is the idea that a success is a customer paying with a debit card and a failure is for any other form of payment.

*'''Part b.''' Let &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt; be the number of person who do not pay with cash.  A success in this case is a customer paying with any form not cash and a failure is to paying with cash.

:&lt;math&gt; Y \sim \text{Binomial}\left( n = 100, p = 0.70 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rcccl}
E(Y) &amp;=&amp; np &amp;=&amp; 70 \\
Var(Y) &amp;=&amp; np(1-p) &amp;=&amp; 21
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Exercise 66. ===
Let &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; be the number of people with a reservation who show up for the limo.  

&lt;math&gt; X \sim \text{Binomial}\left( n = 6, p = 0.80 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

*'''Part a.''' What is the probability at least one person who shows up for the limo cannot be accommodated?  Since the limo only holds four people we will not be able to accommodate everyone if five or six show up.

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rcl}
P\left(X \leq 5\right) &amp;=&amp; P(X=5) + P(X=6) \\
 &amp;=&amp; 0.3932 + 0.2621 \\
 &amp;=&amp; 0.6553
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

*'''Part b.''' If there are six reservations made, what is the expected number of open seats in the limo?  We need to define a function &lt;math&gt; h(x) &lt;/math&gt; for the number of open seats as a function of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; the number of people who show for the limo.

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{r|ccccccc}
x    &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\ \hline
h(x) &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

:The expectation of &lt;math&gt; h(X) &lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rcl}
E(h(X)) &amp;=&amp; \sum_{x=0}^{6} h(x) P(X = x) \\
 &amp;=&amp; (4)(0.0001) + (3)(0.0015) + (2)(0.0154) + (1)(0.0819) \\&amp;&amp;+ (0)(0.2458 + 0.3932 + 0.2621) \\
 &amp;=&amp; 0.1176
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

*'''Part c.''' If the probability distribution for the number of reservations is:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{r|cccc}
\text{Reservarions} &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\ \hline
\text{Probability}  &amp; 0.1 &amp; 0.2 &amp; 0.3 &amp; 0.4 \\
\end{array} &lt;/math&gt;

:Then the probability mass function for the number of passengers on a randomly selected trip is found as follows.

: We know that &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; will take on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.  The value of 0 will happen if no one shows up for the limo for any one of the number of possible reservations totals.  We use the law of total probability to find this.  Let &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt; be the number of reservations made and &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt; be the number of people who show up.

:Note that the conditional distribution of &lt;math&gt; Y | R &lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt; Y|R \sim \text{Binomial}\left(n = R, p = 0.80\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rcl}
P(X = 0) &amp;=&amp; \sum_{r=3}^{6} P(Y = 0 | R = r)P(R = r) \\
 &amp;=&amp; \sum_{r=3}^{6} \left( \binom{r}{0} 0.80^x 0.20^{r} \right) P(R = r) \\
 &amp;=&amp; 0.0080 \times 0.1 + 0.0016 \times 0.2 + 0.0003 \times 0.3 + 0.0001 \times 0.4 \\
 &amp;=&amp; 0.00125 \\ \\
P(X = 1) &amp;=&amp; \sum_{r=3}^{6} P(Y = 1 | R = r)P(R = r) \\
 &amp;=&amp; 0.01724 \\ \\
P(X = 2) &amp;=&amp; \sum_{r=3}^{6} P(Y = 2 | R = r)P(R = r) \\
 &amp;=&amp; 0.09064 \\ \\
P(X = 3) &amp;=&amp; \sum_{r=3}^{6} P(Y = 3 | R = r)P(R = r) \\
 &amp;=&amp; 0.22732 \\ \\
P(X = 4) &amp;=&amp; 1 - ( 0.00125 + 0.01724 + 0.09064 + 0.22732) \\
 &amp;=&amp; 0.66355
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;


The probability &lt;math&gt; P(X = 4) &lt;/math&gt; is a little more work because you have to deal with the options of having five or six people show. The easy way to deal with this is to note that &lt;math&gt;P(X = 4) = 1 - P(X \ne 4)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Exercise 67. ===
Using Chebyshev's Inequality find the lower bounds for &lt;math&gt; k = 2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; k = 3 &lt;/math&gt; for 

&lt;math&gt; X \sim \text{Binomial}\left(n=20, p = 0.5\right) &lt;/math&gt; 

The Chebyshev bounds are:

&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rcl}
P\left( \left| X - \mu \right| &gt; k \sigma \right) &amp;\leq&amp;  \frac{1}{k^2} \\ 
 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{4} \quad \text{For } k = 2 \\ \\
 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{9} \quad \text{For } k = 3 
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

For the binomial distribution we have:

&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rcl}
P\left( \left| X - \mu \right| &gt; k \sigma \right) &amp;=&amp; 1 - P\left( \mu - k\sigma &lt; X &lt; \mu + k \sigma\right) \\
&amp;=&amp; 1 - P\left( np - k \sqrt{np(1-p)} &lt; X &lt; np + k \sqrt{np(1-p)} \right) \\
&amp;=&amp; 1 - P\left(5.527 &lt; X &lt; 14.472\right) \quad \text{For } k = 2\\
&amp;=&amp; 1 - P\left( 6 \leq X \leq 14 \right) \\
 &amp;=&amp; 1 - 0.9586105 \\
 &amp;=&amp; 0.0413895 \\
 &amp;=&amp; 1 - P(3.29 &lt; X &lt; 16.708) \quad \text{For } k = 3 \\
 &amp;=&amp; 1 - P(4 \leq X \leq 16) \\
 &amp;=&amp; 1 - 0.9974232 \\
 &amp;=&amp; 0.002576828
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

For the binomial distribution 

&lt;math&gt; X \sim \text{Binomial}\left(n=20,p=.75\right)&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt; k = 2 &lt;/math&gt; the probability is 0.06523779 and for &lt;math&gt; k = 3 &lt;/math&gt; the probability is 0.003942142.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Intent of Illustrating Different Usage of the Theorem=
Panick2k4, thank you for your edits. Here is your revision:


: &lt;font color = green&gt; Definition of Identity &lt;/font&gt; is: &lt;math&gt; \exists \; e_{G} \in G: \forall \; g \in G: e_{G} \ast g = g \ast e_{G} = g &lt;/math&gt;
: It means, e is the identity of group G, because:
:: 0. There is at least one ''e''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; belonging to group G, such that,
:: 1. for ''every'' element ''g'' in group G,
:: 2. ''e''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\ast&lt;/math&gt; ''g'' = ''g'' &lt;math&gt;\ast&lt;/math&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''


It is grammatically sound and flows well in terms of English. However, it does not illustrate the different usage of the theorem in the subsequent theorems in this section. I am sorry that I did not made the intent to show different usages of the theorem clear enough in the original version. Your corrections of grammar is much appreciated.

:I will not pursue the issue further since you are the one working on the book but consider that by reinterpreting the statement:&lt;br&gt; 
:&lt;font color = green&gt; Definition of Identity &lt;/font&gt; is: &lt;math&gt; \exists \; e_{G} \in G: \forall \; g \in G: e_{G} \ast g = g \ast e_{G} = g &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:in a by step way as it is now it creates an unnecessary inequality between the mathematical statement and the interpretation. 
:It should be read:&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;font color = green&gt; Definition of Identity &lt;/font&gt; is: There exists a &lt;math&gt;e_{G}&lt;/math&gt; belonging to G, such that for any g member of G, in a [[w:Binary operation|binary operation]] it will have the [[w:Commutativity|commutative]] property (&lt;math&gt; e_{G} \ast g = g \ast e_{G} &lt;/math&gt;) and be neutral (&lt;math&gt; e_{G} \ast g = g ; g \ast e_{G} = g &lt;/math&gt;).
:The unnecessary complexity created between the first and the second was what lead me to attempt to correct it. Take this as a constructive criticism on the present situation. My view is that it could be made easier to understand and more mathematically correct in the translation of the symbols...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:27, 24 July 2010 (UTC)

:* May be it can look like a step by step interpretation to some people, but that is not my intention. Do you have some suggestions of improving this aspect while still allow the article to show the different usages of the definition?

:* I want readers to understand the different usage of the definition. People might confuse different usage of the definition, just like the different usage of a word in English.

:* This kind of confusion is like confusing the meanings of &quot;see&quot; in &quot;I see&quot;, which means understands, and in &quot;I see a black cat&quot;, which means perceives through vision.

:* To avoid this kind of confusion, some dictionaries list different usage of the same word. Similarly, I think listing different usage of the same definition can help our readers.

:* Some of the links from other theorems to this page has &lt;small&gt;(usage x)&lt;/small&gt; to indicate which interpretation of the definition is the proof using, as the same definition can have more than one meaning [[User:Arydye001|Arydye001]] ([[User talk:Arydye001|talk]]) 00:44, 25 July 2010 (UTC)


:::* I did read it as a badly stated step by step interpretation, one solution is to reverse the presentation, start by your simplification and then provide the mathematical statement. Use notes for clarification &lt;nowiki&gt;{{NOTE|Information}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; that don't have a direct impact on the on topic information. 
:::* You should also increase wikilinks and interlinking between the book pages even if something seems obvious to you. I did come across this page because I was reviewing something and wasn't fallowing the meaning of binary operation, then I decided to correct that and it lead to editing this page.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:55, 25 July 2010 (UTC)


::::* I remember that I liked the link to binary operation added by you.. I am sorry that I forget to add it back. [[User:Arydye001|Arydye001]] ([[User talk:Arydye001|talk]]) 01:11, 25 July 2010 (UTC)
::::* {{NOTE|The box and the pale aqua background seem really tidy and nice, but I don't like the bold &quot;Note&quot; title that can't be something else}}

::::: You can create a different template for the book. Duplicate/Create a Note template in [[Template:Abstract Algebra/Note]] and configure it for use in the book. Remember to add &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Abstract Algebra/Templates|Keyword]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the page also, if you evolve from the original make a entry on the original template talk just to let know that you will be using it a bit afferently.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:35, 25 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

While I truly appreciate the effort of finding the pictures and writing the content, &lt;font color = forestgreen&gt;I feel too much is on this single page &lt;/font&gt; ([[Abstract_Algebra/Groups/Older_Version |Older Version]]). Despite this is the first time I edit wikipedia, I will try to change this book. I hope the kind contributors of this book can understand. I am trying to learn abstract algebra with several friends. Forgive me if I mess up something.

:Sounds great!  I am happy someone is deciding to help work on tis book.  If you need any help with anything, you should stop by [[WB:RR/G|the reading room]] or if it is very math specific you can asking at [[WB:WikiProject Mathematics]] (you can consider adding yourself).  I am taking a break and will not be around much in the next few months, but maybe I will poke my head in now and again to help you get settled.  Remember to [[WB:BOLD|be Bold]] in editing, if you make a mistake some else can always fix it.

A &quot;smart pointer&quot; is a general term that can be used for multiple types of classes: e.g. std::auto_ptr&lt;&gt;, std::shared_ptr&lt;&gt;, std::weak_ptr&lt;&gt;, etc.   This page should likely try to clarify that a &quot;smart pointer&quot; is not necessarily be an auto_ptr&lt;&gt;.  Instead give a more general definition of smart pointer, and clarify that auto_ptr&lt;&gt; is one type of smart pointer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General==
This document refers to the [[w:Toyota Prius|Toyota Prius 2004-2009 (NHW20)]] and contains information only where details for the Prius differ from 'ordinary' vehicles. The Prius doesn't lend itself to home maintenance beyond the usual oil/coolant levels, tyres, etc. Almost everything electrical is computer controlled so special equipment is required to diagnose faults or change parameters. Also, worth mentioning, is the high voltage battery which can give a nasty jolt to anyone who takes liberties with it. Having said that, there are still steps that owners can take to minimise future problems and even some relatively minor problems that can be easily and safely fixed by the owner.

==Electrical==
===Flat Battery!===
The normal 12 volt battery, located in the back under the cover by the right hand wheel arch, is quite small and will discharge if the car isn't used for more than a couple of months. This battery is used only to maintain the memories of various in-car systems and to start the hybrid system when the driver needs the vehicle, there is no heavy starter motor to crank over which explains the small size of the battery. A total loss of power such as a flat or disconnected battery can cause unforeseen problems, these are not insurmountable or even serious but can be annoying. These issues need to be restored by clearing the error codes from the system (see below). A flat battery can also cause an embarrassing problem - access to the inside of the car can be difficult once the battery is flat if the owner hasn't taken care to use the manual key occasionally (locks seize up if not used so it's a very good idea to use the manual key once a month just to keep the locks working). 

[[image:Prius_Fusebox_with_exposed_jumpstart_terminal.jpg|right|thumb|Jumpstart Terminal]] 
===Jumpstarting the Prius===
The Prius can be jumpstarted just like any other car. Access to the battery is not needed though, there is a jumpstart terminal hidden under a red plastic cover in the fusebox - this is located under the bonnet (or hood). Sufficient power from the donor vehicle is required to start the hybrid system, this is far less than a normal vehicles starter motor would require. Connect the +12 volt lead to this terminal, then the ground lead to any bare metal part in the engine compartment. Once that is done, just start the Prius as normal. The leads can then be disconnected, there is no need to leave them connnected once the hybrid system has started even if the engine hasn't fired up. This sometimes catches out drivers of recovery vehicles who think the Prius has failed to start or has stalled. '''WARNING: Do not attempt to push start a Prius and take great care to get the leads the right way round, mixing up the polarity (+ to -) WILL cause extremely expensive damage to your Prius.'''

===Recharging the 12 volt battery===
The 12 volt battery can be recharged using a standard car battery charger. The best way to charge the battery though, is to take the car for a drive, at least 20 minutes. Unlike normal cars, the Prius does not charge the 12 volt battery via an alternator spun by the engine. This vehicle charges its 12 volt battery directly via the hybrid system so if you are unable to take the car out for a run for any reason, just switching the system on for a while will do the job. Be aware that the engine will start occasionally to ensure the high voltage battery doesn't discharge - something to bear in mind if the car is parked in a closed garage. Doing this will also wreck your miles per gallon record...

===Notes about the high voltage battery===
The high voltage battery will never discharge under normal operating conditions. The Prius strives to keep the battery within normal parameters while the car is being driven and it is physically disconnected via a relay when the car is shut down. It is charged automatically by energy reclaimed by the hybrid system when the vehicle is slowing down and by running the main engine when required. Barring faults, the only way to discharge the high voltage battery is to run the car without fuel, thus preventing the engine starting. This is to be avoided except in emergencies and a specific warning is given in the vehicles handbook about this. If access is needed to the battery, there is a safety plug, close to the battery itself, which can be used to disconnect it completely for maintenance purposes. Having said that, there is no need for the average owner to go near that battery and it is ''not'' necessary to unplug it if you're not intending to use the car for some time.

===The Diagnostic Trouble Codes===
[[image:OBD-connector-pinout.png|right|thumb|OBD-II Socket Pinout]]
The ''Diagnostic Trouble Codes'' or DTC's (also known simply as fault codes) are stored automatically whenever any of the sensors are outside of predetermined parameters. For instance, on the Prius, there are sensors at the braking systems master cylinder and also at the calipers. If the sensors show different readings, the system logs this as a fault. The fault codes are not generally cleared automatically; they are stored until reset manually with an ''[[w:On-board diagnostics#OBD-II|OBD-II diagnostic tester]]''. If you have such a tool and wish to interrogate the system and/or reset the fault codes, you can just plug it in and follow the instructions for the particular tool you are using. If you don't have an OBD-II tester, you can get away with a ''Special Service Tool (SST) 09843-18040'' from Toyota. This is used to safely link particular terminals together in order to get the system to display the stored fault codes and respond to instructions given via the vehicles sensors. Warning lights on the dashboard that refuse to extinguish even when you are sure there is no fault can be due to stored fault codes.
====To clear the stored fault codes using the SST====
# Use the SST to connect terminals 4 and 13 of the OBD-II socket.
# Turn on the vehicles power (just press the power button).
# Press the brake pedal at least eight times within five seconds.
# Check that there are no warnings displayed on the dashboard - if warnings are still displayed, turn the power off and repeat from step 2.
# Unplug the SST.

===Radio - poor reception===
Poor reception on the Prius, including crackling, on both AM and FM is usually a grounding problem at the antenna end. The antenna is mounted on the roof, right at the back in the centre. The fix then is simply to gain access, unbolt the antenna, clean the antenna and the area of the roof where it makes contact, smear some dielectric grease on the contact point to prevent corrosion in the future (petroleum jelly will suffice) and put it all back together. Unfortunately, in order to gain access to the contact point in order to clean it, you'll need to remove the rear internal light assembly and drop the headlining at the back. 

===Auto (power) function of electric windows not working===
Disconnecting the 12 volt battery in a Prius (or allowing it to go flat), will cause the automatic function of the power windows to fail. They need to be recalibrated before they will work properly again. Fortunately this is an easy task. Just use the switch to lower the window to about half way. Then use the same switch to raise the window. Hold the switch in the (up) position for at least a second after the window stops moving. If that fails, try disconnecting the battery again for a few minutes, reconnect it and try again, holding the switch for a couple of seconds after the window stops.

      <text xml:space="preserve">PeKudei  Accountings Of  Shemot/Exodus 38:21-40:38

1 Melachim/Kings I Kings 8:1-66;   2 Corinthians 3:7-18


In this portion we come to the finality of the preparations for the Tabernacle.  Everything prior to this in all the elaborate, detailed and costly preparations a dwelling place is being made to house the Infinite, the Creator of all.  The heaven of heaven cannot contain Him, much less a house of wood and metal.   1 Kings 8:27


&lt;u&gt;The Encounter with the Most High&lt;/u&gt;

Many non-Messianic believers think that the “Law” or what we call Torah, was given to the Israelites so they could earn their salvation.   But this is not the case at all, because by honoring the Torah we learn to be obedient to our Heavenly Father, Who wants the best for His children.  The Torah is to show us that when we obey Yahweh and are faithful to Him in the “smallest” things, then He will be with us and guard us by day and night.   If we are not faithful to Him, then He will not be as faithful to us in responding to our prayers and needs. 

When Exodus began,  we have a people who seem to be unfamiliar with Yahweh’s principles - His Torah. Although they had the traditions of their fathers, they were as yet untrained in the way of righteousness. What a contrast we have with the emphasis in this portion, where 18 times it is mentioned that they obeyed the instructions that they were given. 

“ As Yahweh commanded Moshe” is an emphasis giving commendation to the fact that they were obeying those commands and carrying them out in every detail. Hence this emphasis that they followed the specifications in everything which they were instructed. It appears as a notation of commendation regarding their repentance and change of heart after the golden calf incident.

Here we have a people that have been unified around the project of establishing a meeting-place with their God, working together, following instructions and showing the semblance of becoming a nation out of the mixed multitude that came out of Egypt with no real cohesion except their deliverance, devoid of an established faith and trust in Yahweh and undisciplined except for the heavy rod of the Taskmasters of Egypt which generated within them a rebellion against authority.  They went from being a Torah-less ignorant enslaved group of tribes to a nation unified around the revelation of the Torah.

They also progressed from being a people who doubted Yahweh’s interest and care of them, to a people who had Him residing in their midst.  There is no record of Him having spoken to them in the long silent years of their bondage in Egypt.   Initially, it seems that He only spoke to Moshe, and through him to them when it came time for their deliverance.  Although He had spoken through some of His ordained prophets like Mirium regarding their future deliverance, they had no personal encounter with Him,  and so when they came to Sinai, it was an awesome experience to have the Most High manifest Himself to them.

He began the revelation of Himself to them in a progressive manner.
Firstly His introduction of Himself by Name in Chapters 3 and 6 to Moshe who is to go and make it know to the people.   Then as Moshe goes to them He reveals His intentions and His heart toward them which was then backed up by His actions, demonstrating His power on their behalf.
He then reveals His character which Moshe revels in the song of deliverance in Chapter 15 and then again in Chapter 34.    These characteristics have become known as the “Thirteen Attributes” of God.   They reveal the character and the heart of Yahweh.
The final stage in the encounter, is personal contact and personal conversation of the Almighty with His people at Sinai, with the end result of Him taking up full-time residence with them.

The temple was set in place, on the first new moon (the first day) of the first month of the second year of the Exodus.  According to Rashi, the tabernacle was raised up on the eighth day of the priests’ dedication.
It is estimated that this took approximately six months, comparing Exodus 19:1 to Exodus 40: 2  and taking out the time Moshe was on the mount.  This is a testimony to the power of Yahweh’s Spirit motivating and facilitating the work through anointed craftsmen and the hearts of the people united in their purpose to serve Him and fulfill His purposes.
The resources for all that was required to construct the Tabernacle originated from the spoils of Egypt that they collected at Yahweh’s direction before they left.

When the Mishkan was complete, the Shekinah glory of God came and  took up residence in the Holy of Holies (the inner sanctuary).    This continued until the time of Eli the priest when, because of sin and unfaithfulness, the glory departed and was not re-instated until Solomon built the Temple at Jerusalem, having had a temporary residence in the tabernacle that David established for it.

Although His presence was not manifest as strongly in the second temple which was constructed after their return from Babylonian captivity, it wasn’t until the time of the fulfilment of Ezekiel’s vision (Chapter 10) that the Shekinah glory actually completely departed from residing with them in the Temple, and this was fulfilled in 70 AD with the destruction of the Temple by the Roman General Titus, 40 years after the rejection of Messiah.

What a transition from being a people who found it difficult to sense anything of God’s presence amidst their suffering, to having such a profound revelation of Him given to them.   They were singled out to have the privileged experience of the actual glory of Yahweh manifested in physical form in their midst.   

God has promised us that the miracles of the ultimate Redemption will echo those of the Redemption from Egypt, as is written in prophecies of Micah, “As in the days of your exodus from Egypt, I will show you wonders.”    Micah 7:15  This is also seen in the Book of Revelation in the plagues poured out in the vials of His wrath on the wicked of that day.  He has promised that He will release us from the powers of darkness on that day, not just in one locality, but giving us a complete redemption from the enemy on this whole earth for one thousand years.  This will be a second exodus mightier in the demonstration of His power in Egypt.


&lt;u&gt;The Glory and the Tabernacle&lt;/u&gt;

A sudden shout rose up through the assembly and all eyes were fixed upon the mountain. The cloud which had covered the top of the mountain these many days seemed to be descending. Yes, it was, rolling and cascading down the mountainside like a sudden avalanche of vapor, mist and smoke.
A panic spread through the people; a holy terror seized every heart. As if choreographed in advance, all Israel - every man, woman and child - fell prostrate to the ground.  There was a brilliant light emanating from the cloud as it dropped from the top of Mount Sinai. The peak of the mountain was now visible, gleaming in the sun.  Without the cloud covering it, it seemed to be a small, humble and insignificant mountain after all.  Yahweh had left Sinai.

“Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Yahweh filled the tabernacle. Moshe was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of Yahweh filled the tabernacle.” Exodus 40:34–35

Yahweh had taken up residence in the Tabernacle, but He was unapproachable. Even Moshe, who was accustomed to standing upon Mount Sinai and basking in the glory of the presence of Yahweh, could not enter. How is it, then, that Moshe was able to withstand God’s glory on Mount Sinai, yet was not able to enter into the Tabernacle?

When Moshe ascended Sinai, he entered into the true Tabernacle, the very courts of God. Thus the glory of God on the mountain represents the glory of God in the World to Come and the New Covenant, whereas the glory of God in the Tabernacle is His glory in this World and that covenant.  That is the reason Moshe can approach on the mountain, but was unable to do so when the glory descends to the earth. The mountain symbolized the Heavenly reality.  Thus even Yeshua had to veil His glory (except while on the mountain of transfiguration--a parallel to Sinai).  His glory will only be fully revealed when the heavenly reality is fully realized on Earth.  

In that day, God’s people will be able to approach the Glory without restriction, as John notes, “I saw no temple in it, for Yahweh God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.” (Revelation 21:22-23)

Through His death, Yeshua opened a way into the Shekinah glory through the veil that separated God from His people.   Now through Him, we have access into His Presence, although it is in a measure.
“Therefore brethren, having boldness to enter the the Holiest by the blood of Yeshua, by  a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, His flesh ..  “  Hebrews 10:20   His flesh is typified by the veil of the temple - In the giving of His life, we have access.   His death was the entrance to the Father’s Presence.    


&lt;u&gt;His Presence Journeyed With Them&lt;/u&gt;

For throughout all their journeys, the cloud of Yahweh was on the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel”    Shemot/Exodus 40:34-38

The word “journeys” includes the places where they camped as well, because from each place they began a new journey. The cloud was not over the tabernacle during the journeys, only when they camped, see 40:36.
This short excerpt above talks about the kavod  of God, or His “glory” filling the Tabernacle.  Imagine what an awesome sight that must have been.   The “cloud” or anan covered the ohel moed  or “tent of meeting”.   This could be understood as a “tent of appointed assembly,” as we know that moed means “appointed time”   The moedim or appointed times, also commonly called the feasts of Yahweh,  are given to us in Vayikra/Leviticus 23


&lt;u&gt;His Appointed Times&lt;/u&gt;

Though the work was finished in the month of Keslev, God wanted it to be erected on Rosh Chodesh (the 1st day) of Nissan.  Yahweh had a special timing, an appointed time that was to be followed precisely, for His purposes.  This points to the time of the new covenant, because of its proximity to the start of the religious calendar, and it occurred in the second year.  
The fact that the work took time to accomplish, is prophetic of the time that the preparation of the New Covenant would take to complete in which Yahweh tabernacles in us.

God’s presence descended upon the Israelites in the wilderness in the tent of meeting,” or tent of appointment”.   In His Torah, our Father has specified the appropriate times that He wants to meet with His people. If we want to meet with Him and have the glory of God surrounding us and protecting us and ministering to us we should “meet” Him  at the times that He has consecrated. These are the times that He wants to be met and has specified throughout His Torah that He wants us to set-apart and consecrated unto Him. If we meet with Him on these days and follow the simple instructions which He has given to us,  He will reveal His presence to us. 

The first Temple/Beit Hamikdash stood for a total of 410 years and the second one lasted 420 years. 
There are many numeric patterns in the scriptures.   The word “Mishkan” (the Tabernacle) has the numerical value of 410 and the word “Hamishkan” (Testimony) has the numerical value of 415.  If we add to the numerical value the five letters of the word, we will then have 420.

The Gemara (Yoma 21b) relates that in the second Temple/Beit Hamikdash there were five things missing which were in the first Beit Hamikdash.  Therefore, the Torah’s allusion to the second Beit Hamikdash (Hamishkan) has the numerical value of only 415.

From the time the Tabernacle/Mishkan was built in the dessert till the construction of the first Beit Hamikdash by King Shlomo there elapsed a period of 479 years. The word Testimony “Ha’eidut” has the numerical equivalent of 479 in the Hebrew language. This alludes to the fact that for 479 years the Mishkan served as a testimony to Yahweh’s dwelling among the Israelite people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Welcome to Lojbanistan! Let's begin.
==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
Lojban uses the Latin alphabet, with some changes. All letters are lowercase, except for in names, when capital letters are sometimes used to say which syllable is stressed. The letters '''H''', '''Q''', and '''W''' are not used. The apostrophe (') is pronounced like an '''H''' in English. A period (.) is a pause between words. A comma (,) is used to separate two vowels. For example the name Pierre would be &quot;pi,ER&quot; in Lojban. The reason Lojban has a modified alphabet is to remove the guesswork in pronouncing words. For example, if you read a new word, let's say ''ambiguity'', you might pronounce the first '''i''' to rhyme with '''pee''', and the '''ui''' to rhyme with '''you-we''' (by the way, this is the correct pronunciation), but how do you know if the '''i''' isn't pronounced like the '''ee''' in bee, or the '''ui''' like '''wee'''? Those combinations of letters can make both sounds. This sort of confusion is the definition of the word ''ambiguity''. Lojban's strange alphabet is designed to get rid of ambiguity; since there is only one way to pronounce a word in Lojban, there's no confusion at all!

==Where is this language spoken?==
Worldwide, but some people might say &quot;Lojbanistan&quot; which means the same thing. Since Lojban isn't a natural language, it isn't really associated with places like English is. Many English speakers are found in England and the United States, but speakers of Lojban are found everywhere around the world.
==What is the history of this language?==
Lojban had its roots in a language called &quot;Loglan&quot;. In 1987, the Logical Language Group was created to further develop Loglan, and eventually created Lojban—that makes Lojban a constructed language.
{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|constructed language|a language that someone invented.  This is unlike English and other '''natural languages''' whose rules and vocabulary evolved over hundreds or thousands of years.}}

==How can I write my name in Lojban?==
#Spell your name phonetically in Lojban. &quot;Drew&quot; becomes &quot;dru&quot;, for example.
#If it ends with a vowel, drop it or add a consonant (usually ⟨s⟩). &quot;dru&quot; is now &quot;dr&quot; or &quot;drus&quot; (I'd go with the latter).
#Put dots at the beginning and end. &quot;drus&quot; is now &quot;.drus.&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Doubts about the notability of Lojban ==

It's not clear whether Lojban should be included in this book.  The general issue of conlang inclusion has been raised &amp;mdash;and I recently made a comment that mentioned Lojban specifically&amp;mdash; [[Wikijunior talk:{{BASEPAGENAME}}#Standards for Constructed Languages|here]].  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 18:26, 25 July 2010 (UTC)
: That's true; however for sakes [[wikt:jbo:]] and [[w:jbo:]] exist and are Lojban wikis. '''—[[User:I-20|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;I-20&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:I-20|&lt;span style=&quot;vertical-align:super;&quot;&gt;the highway&lt;/span&gt;]]''' 18:29, 25 July 2010 (UTC)

::That's relevance for a wikibook targeted at an adult audience.  Worthiness for inclusion here is something different.

::Esperanto and Quenya both have the potential for inspiring stories for kids, in their history sections, about how their creator started as a kid and kept at it their whole life.  There's some hope for Klingon, because there's ''fun'' in it that can appeal to kids; and that fun can make kids think about the relationship between language and patterns of thought.  I think there are head-count and cultural-mainstream problems with Lojban, but what I'm having ''most'' trouble with is that I don't see anything about it that's inspiring to the WJ audience.  Anything fun about it is not a sort of fun that will appeal to kids.  It wasn't started by someone when they were a kid.  Is there a way to make it fun?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 18:04, 26 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

Why don't we take an idea from Google Wave, and only start a new level if we are replying to something in the middle of the conversation, and then go down like that. Then,

{{hiddenh3|Instead of like this}}
Arlen: Hello all
: Someone: Arlen, it's &quot;Hi all&quot;
:: Arlen: Of course, all in your way of looking at it
:Someone: Hi, Arlen, what's up.

::Arlen: I have this problem

{{hiddenh3|It would look like this}}
Arlen: Hello all
: Someone: Arlen, it's &quot;Hi all&quot;

:LiquidThreads is in my experience great for social chatting, and unsuitable for serious discussion.

:::If we're going to use some such device, I'd actually favor using barnstars as such.  Customized, probably.  Even Wikinews, where they are deeply suspicious, with some cause, of all things Wikipedian &amp;mdash;they rarely even call it by name, using indirections like &quot;The Other Place&quot;&amp;mdash; uses customized barnstars (e.g., [[:File:CopyeditorStar7.PNG|this]]); so it's very clear barnstars are not an idiosyncrasy of Wikipedian culture.  I imagine us forging our own traditions about when to use them (promotion of a book to featured status springs to mind)&lt;s&gt;, and my guess is that generic barnstars would probably never catch on here&lt;/s&gt;.

:::The remarkably short proposal thread from last year that Kayau refers to is one that stuck in my mind; I worried for months after whether the doubts I'd expressed were any reason not to try it and see, and worried that the early death of the thread might have been due to a difference in how confident the participants were of their place in the Wikibooks community, rather than due to anything about the issues raised.  (Okay, so I worry a lot.)  My thinking has evolved since then, not least my perception of how much good a vibrant tradition of barnstars can do for the morale and interpersonal good will of a project, though the second paragraph of my post then still pretty much makes sense to me.  That thread is archived [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2009/August#Barnstar|here]]. --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 17:55, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

{{Comment}} Several of these threads have been rendered unreadable by redacting other people's comments to remove the indentation.  It's an impressive demonstration of why lack of indentation is a terrible idea, but that doesn't need to be demonstrated further, and more to the point it's inappropriate to redact other people's comments.

Sorry, but I'd prefer we stick to the topic (barnstars) here, and continue the discussion about LiquidThreads up there. As a regular of WP's WikiProject Wikipedia Awards, I'm quite convinced that 80% of WP's awards don't fit in WB, and given the fact that most people who are involved in the community also do all kinds of maintenance work as well as work on their own books (this is completely different in WP. In WP, some people stick to maintenance work, some to content creation, and some to reverting vandalism.) Therefore, lots of barnstars don't really apply here. And our difference from WN is that we aren't in a great big rush. So really, one barnstar or award is sufficient for WB, IMHO.

: I think since Wikibooks is book related that Wikibooks should follow the practice of giving out medals instead of barn stars. [http://grizzlymedia.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/national_book_award_medal.jpg National Book Award Medal] and [http://www.ala.org/ala/newspresscenter/mediapresscenter/presskits/youthmediaawards/Newbery%20Front%20A.jpg John Newbery Medal] to name two examples. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:38, 4 July 2010 (UTC)

::::The distribution of letters WIKI around the perimeter doesn't work for me (notwithstanding that as pure abstract art it's quite elegant).  It took me some moments to come up with a theory as to what the letters were supposed to be doing, and further time to reach a substantial level of confidence in the theory.  However I try, I just can't ''see'' those letters as spelling WIKI; what always instantly leaps to my eye is two consecutive I's.  It might be a matter of regional variations in idioms for representing writing &amp;mdash; one could imagine that words proceeding linearly around the perimeter a disk would be a more common idiom in purely alphabetic writing traditions.  Alternatively, it might be some subtle interaction with the direction of the lines in the graphic at the center.

#Unanimity and consensus aren't the same but can coexist, I presume consensus was select for the decision model because it is the only process that reduces the issue of the active minority, since the majority of the community will always remain in silence due to the volatility of the participation. The distinction is that unanimity requires all to state support, and consensus only requires that no one states objection, the implication on the requirements of participation in decisions becomes obvious, and why consensus is optimal for our volunteering setup. We can with great confidence state that a unanimous community decision is an impossibility and that every time community consensus is reached it will never reflect all the community, but permits giving special power to supposedly minority views in the form of a block. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:16, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

#:Do you mean that there can be no objections? This is not the commonly used form of consensus used on Wikibooks. Usually consensus means that there are no overwhelmingly significant objections to something, and the objections that are there are not the majority. If there is one support vote and a whole bunch of objections with weak reasons, then it would be blocked, of course, even if no one had a significant reason for objection.

Consider a decision where only two participants interact, if consensus fails and a block continues to exist what is the outcome ?

== A proposal about module names. ==

&lt;s&gt;Someone mentioned to me recently that did not care for the phrase &quot;module&quot; in describing the units of a book here.  I would like to propose we change this to &quot;page&quot;.  As one usually thinks of books as consisting of Pages, sections, chapters, etc it would be be IMO intuitively pleasing to call our basic units of a book by the phrase &quot;pages&quot;.&lt;/s&gt;  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:23, 9 July 2010 (UTC)

:I think model was picked at the time because people felt works could be broken up into units smaller than a traditional paper page.

::::: A &quot;module&quot; implies modularity, that components may be separated and recombined, this doesn't reflect our &quot;content pages&quot;, in that regard a Wikibook is a module of Wikibooks.
::::: Regarding &quot;articles&quot; at Wikipedia I don't see an issue, I get the meaning that it refers to an &quot;encyclopedic article&quot;, not all Wikipedia &quot;content pages&quot; are &quot;articles&quot;, they can be biographies.

== [[Template:User book]] ==

I've created a template that takes as its one, unnamed parameter the title of any book, and produced a userbox &amp;mdash;customizable on a per-book basis&amp;mdash; like this:
{{User book|Linear Algebra|nocat=1}}
{{clr}}
It also adds the user to a category. 

My idea is that if we could manage to nurture a widespread habit at Wikibooks of declaring interest in the books one contributes to, that would help users to recognize each others' interests, and help to promote local- and even intermediate-level community interaction.  There are a bunch of unanswered questions about this, ranging from nuts and bolts to broad community organization.  Some that come to mind:
* Right now, the category it generates is&amp;nbsp; &lt;s&gt;{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Category:Book users/''Book Title''&lt;/code&gt;}}&lt;/s&gt;&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Category:''Book Title''/Users&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, such as&amp;nbsp; &lt;s&gt;{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Category:Book users/Linear Algebra&lt;/code&gt;}}&lt;/s&gt;&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Category:Linear Algebra/Users&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.  I was thinking of wiring {{tl|BookCat}} so that it would make these categories subcategories of the book categories (similarly to what it now does for book-specific template categories), but I'm not really sure whether I've chosen the right name for the categories, nor whether they should belong to the book categories.
* I'd like to generalize the facility to handle units larger than a single book, and to handle Cookbook in some useful way; but I really haven't got a clue how best to go about it.  To start with, what units (other than books) does one want to be able to specify?
* Once we've got the template the way we like it, what can we do to encourage people to use it, so that over time it comes to be widespread enough to get a [[w:Network effect|network effect]] going?

Would anyone have a dire objection to mmoving [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance/Renaming]] to [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Renaming]]?

:::::I understood the split of the previous structure, now we are adding the proposals page, we should make an effort to keep the number low and the structure stable, alterations are highly disruptive in this types of pages, a user that is absent should come back and have the expectation of this pages showing on the watch-list.

:::::: It's my understanding that when a page one someone's watchlist is moved, the old and new names both end up on their watchlist.  If I'm right about that, not only does it mean that renaming needn't cause watchlist problems, but it also means that a split could be arranged not to cause watchlist problems either:  When splitting page A into pages A and B, first move A to B (so putting both onto the watchlist of anyone who had been watching A), and then split some of the content from B back to A.  Alternatively, if the split was originally done by cut-and-paste from A to B, after the fact one could move B to C, move A to B (deleting a redirect to make room), then move B to A, and move C to B (deleting a redirect to make room).  Which should leave A and B both on the watchlists of anyone who was watching A ''or'' B before.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 21:51, 18 July 2010 (UTC)

::::::: If so than the problem is reduced (but does not cover splitting pages). I would like someone that knows to confirm that? and if that was always so? My understanding was different (mostly on editing a book I sometimes find pages that I don't have a watch and I original was the creator), this is especially annoying to me because of the different talk pages.

:That was expected since you where the one that performed the split and no other move occurred (note that it depends on the default setting on page creation or the intentional action to start monitoring the new page).

:: In my experience what Pi zero said about the watchlist is true, and has been for many years. Is that the confirmation you are after? If you want pages you edit or create to be automatically added to your watchlist by default you need to look at your watchlist preferences. There are preferences of the form &quot;Add pages I (edit|move|create|review) to my watchlist&quot;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:18, 18 July 2010 (UTC)

::: I've also just confirmed it by experiment, using {{nowrap|Pi zero}} and another (legacy) account that has no privileges beyond autoconfirmation.  As {{nowrap|Pi zero}} I created {{nowrap|[[User:Pi zero/A]]}}, and put that on the watchlist of the other account.  Then as {{nowrap|Pi zero}} I moved {{nowrap|[[User:Pi zero/A]]}} to {{nowrap|[[User:Pi zero/B]]}}, and that resulted in ''both'' pages being on the watchlist of the other account.  I tried a few variations on the test, and got the same result each time:  the watching account ended up watching both the old name and the new name.

:::As I remarked earlier, this ''can'' be used to split a page into two in such a way that anyone who had been watching the original page will end up watching both pages after the split.  We could, for example, use this technique to add the new Proposals reading room to the watchlist of anyone who is now watching the General reading room but wasn't watching Feature requests.

::::Well, this enables further possibilities should anyone be so brave as to put them forward.  It certainly means that Xerol's idea wouldn't be a problem for people watching the pages.  I don't know that anyone should worry too much about this room; only '''two''' people really need to watch it. I'm tempted to go with Pi zero's suggestion, as it won't involve renaming a ton of subpages in the form of archives and would leave other rooms alone. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:11, 20 July 2010 (UTC)

* Use three levels other than unreviewed, rather than the current four (minimal, average, good).
* Review form no longer has a comment box.
* Administrators can set pages show the most recent excellent revision for Anonymous/Unregistered users.
* FlaggedRevs becomes ignorable, except where contributors decide to opt into it, like Wikijunior.
* Auto promotion to reviewer requires at least 8 edits each 2 days apart, instead of 10 edits each 2 days apart.
* Auto promotion check requires 5 edits in recent changes at time of check, instead of 10.
* People sharing the same IP address can now be auto promoted.
* Reviewers can undo a series of changes using rollback.
* Rollback, Patroller, and Editor groups are removed to avoid confusion.
* Everything else about FlaggedRevs remains the same.
* Reader feedback will be enabled for pages in the main space, the cookbook, and Wikijunior.
* Anyone can provide reader feedback at five levels for reliability, completeness, neutrality, and presentation.
* Reader feedback for pages will be based on input received over the past 180 days.
* A page's overall reader feedback rating will not be shown until at least 5 people have rated the page.
* Count pages in the main space, cookbook, and Wikijunior namespaces as content pages, instead of just the main space. As a side effect more edits will count towards auto promotion for reviewers, auto confirmed will likely happen sooner, and statistics will be more accurate.

* Bureaucrats can add people to the &quot;pseudo-bot&quot; group
* Enable edit filter extension to deal with and flag clear-cut vandalism.
* Edit filters and actions can be adjusted by administrators, but the ability to block a user or remove a user from a group will be disabled.

The [[MediaWiki:Revreview-editnotice]] interface text is shown to non-editors trying to edit pages with reviewed revisions and lends credence to those worried that the system discourages participation.  The call to remove the [unreviewed] markers in recent changes in the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Technical_Assistance&amp;oldid=1854219#Turn_off_.22unreviewed.22_markers_for_a_specific_wikibook.3F technical assistance reading room] was just a symptom of the larger problem&amp;mdash;only 21% of main space pages are reviewed according to [[Special:ValidationStatistics]].  

In the same page linked above for the technical reading room, Jomegat suggests only three levels, including unreviewed.  That makes sense to me.  Visit http://en.labs.wikimedia.org to see what it could look like (with an old database of our content, even). 

Editors would see: [[:File:Wikibooks editor.png]]

Reviewers would see: [[:File:Wikibooks reviewer.png]]

Examining our [http://noc.wikimedia.org/conf/flaggedrevs.php.txt configuration], we should remove &lt;tt&gt;$wgFlaggedRevValues = 4;&lt;/tt&gt;, change to &lt;tt&gt;$wgFlaggedRevTags = array('quality' =&gt; 2);&lt;/tt&gt; and change to &lt;tt&gt;$wgFlagRestrictions = array('quality' =&gt; array('review' =&gt; 1, 'autoreview' =&gt; 1) );&lt;/tt&gt;,  This would give us what you see at labs, but with &quot;quality&quot; instead of &quot;accuracy&quot;.  The labels &quot;sighted&quot; and &quot;good&quot; are able to be modified by the MediaWiki namespace interface text.  Additionally, we're migrating files to Commons, so there's no need for it to remain on for that namespace.  &lt;s&gt;In fact, I'd propose only having it on for Wikijunior with &lt;tt&gt;$wgFlaggedRevsNamespaces = array(110);&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/s&gt;  I also suggest &lt;tt&gt;$wgFlaggedRevsComments = false;&lt;/tt&gt; to remove the comment box as I don't believe anyone takes the time to add in a comment when they sight. Additionally, I should note that though&lt;tt&gt;$wgFlaggedRevTabs = false;&lt;/tt&gt;, I still see the &quot;latest draft&quot; tab on an outdated page. Finally, to correctly implement autopromotion regardless of namespaces applied, &lt;tt&gt;$wgContentNamespaces = 0, 102, 110;&lt;/tt&gt; should be set to have edits to the Cookbook and especially Wikijunior count.

The CSS coloring the boxes wouldn't be needed because we'd be using a check box/radio buttons.  &lt;s&gt;The CSS hiding [unreviewed] wouldn't be needed because it'd only be Wikijunior pages showing it until reviewed.  Main space pages would revert to patrolling using the same &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; that we've seen already.  And flagged revisions wouldn't be pointed to as a reason for declining participation and wouldn't be a cause of it.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;!-- comment out to avoid confusion; see box to right 
Summary of proposal:
*&lt;s&gt;Flagged revisions on for Wikijunior only (likely subject to most debate)&lt;/s&gt;
*Three levels other than unreviewed for one criteria, top level accessible to admins only
*No comment box (takes up less space, unused)
*Include Cookbook/Wikijunior edits in autopromotion
*Remove &lt;tt&gt;reviewers&lt;/tt&gt; group and rename &lt;tt&gt;editors&lt;/tt&gt; group to &quot;reviewers&quot; in interface to avoid confusion (anyone can edit) --&gt;

I've said before that $wgContentNamespaces needed to be changed to include the Cookbook and Wikijunior, so I agree there. I can also agree with one criteria &quot;quality&quot;. I can also agree with turning commenting off. However I think editors should still be able to continue to rate all levels as before, otherwise more work is placed on Reviewers. I also think we should continue to have autoreview turned off because that was a source of problems before. I also think that flaggedrevs should continue to be done for the main, cookbook, and wikijunior namespaces. We should try to see if simplifying the criteria to &quot;quality&quot; is enough first before talking about removing it from the main and cookbook namespaces.

I would also like to propose $wgFlaggedRevsLowProfile = true; if its not already set. I would also like to propose as part of these changes that we enable the [[mw:Extension:ReaderFeedback|ReaderFeedback Extension]] like English Wikinews has and have $wgFeedbackNamespaces set to the main, cookbook, and wikijunior namespaces too. My rational is to see whether more pages will be rated if anyone can do so, and if the information it provides would be more useful overall than flaggedrevs for contributors, and what is learned from that might help future proposed changes to flaggerevs.

So what do you say? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 08:59, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

:I thought of using {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;$wgFlaggedRevsLowProfile {{=}} true;&lt;/tt&gt;}} but that makes the review box disappear for reviewed pages, which will keep reviewers from rating the page to a higher level if it's been rated to a lower level by an editor. I don't know why you say editors should be able to continue to rate all levels; they currently can't rate to the highest level, which we've termed &quot;featured quality&quot;.  Only reviewers can rate to that.  Most editors just hit the &quot;submit&quot; button to sight a page and so the two levels above the base level go unused.  The highest level for reviewers-only allows highly visible pages to be changed to show the highest level to logged-out users rather than any level, and to have admins/reviewers examine the page.  Otherwise anyone autopromoted to editor can rate to that highest level.   And since November 14, 2008&lt;sup&gt;[[m:Flagged_Revisions#Flagged_Revisions_on_Wikimedia_projects|*]]&lt;/sup&gt;, we only have 1/5 of the main pages sighted (compare to 99% for 1mil+ pages at German Wikpedia [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spezial:Markierungsstatistik]), leaving the other 80% to standard page patrol.  Simplifying the criteria to &quot;quality&quot; with two levels makes it more convenient for people using the system, where it's used, but it appears to me that it's not caught on for the main space.  If you want to keep it for the Wikijunior, Cookbook, and even templates, I'm okay with that. I'd like to keep reader feedback as a separate issue, at this time. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:13, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

:: Well if keeping a low profile is a problem, I can agree not to do that than.  I mean editors should continue to be able to rate all the levels they could before. I guess we could give editors two choices besides unreviewed: acceptable and good, and let reviewers have the third choice excellent, but the idea is to remove the need to have both editors and reviewers. I wish we could autopromote people to reviewers instead and get rid of the idea of editors since people confuse the two anyways. FlaggedRevs was suppose to be opt-in for each book after the last time we made changes, and I think we need to do a better job of that being the case by discouraging people from sighting revisions in a book unless they want both the benefits and hassles that come with using FlaggedRevs. There is no reason or need to go overboard with sighting revisions for all pages in all books. Even when regular patrol was used people didn't stay on top of it and it was mostly an ignored feature. I see no issue with ignoring FlaggedRevs too except when its wanted for individual books. I think we need to have reader feedback as part of this issue, because it can compliment FlaggedRevs and perhaps help us find a middle ground for reviews and gaining the feedback that people are after. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:37, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

:::In all truth, I didn't expect a lot of support for turning it off for main space (though you're the only objector at this stage).  But I'd want it turned off for files, since they're being exported.  If you look at Wikipedia's configuration, they remove the editors group and only have reviewers.  But could we set it for autopromotion on reviewers?  Or maybe we should turn off &lt;tt&gt;reviewers&lt;/tt&gt; and assign their permissions to &lt;tt&gt;editors&lt;/tt&gt;, then rename &quot;editors&quot; in the interface to &quot;reviewers&quot;. We also need to set $wgFlaggedRevTags such that the top level is &quot;pristine&quot;, the second-from-top is &quot;quality&quot;, and leaving the base as &quot;sighted&quot; if we use three levels rather than two beyond unreviewed. For others looking to decipher this, see [[mw:Extension:FlaggedRevs]] and [http://noc.wikimedia.org/conf/flaggedrevs.php.txt]. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:25, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

::::Turn off for files?  Maybe I'm missing something.  The single biggest vulnerability of Wikijunior to vandalism is that it's got lots of images in it that aren't local and therefore aren't subject to flaggedrevs.  I've suggested before, and have been mulling over suggesting again, that we make local copies of ''all images on Wikijunior'', just so we can review them all and have them covered by flaggedrevs.

::::BTW, nobody has answered my question as to under what circumstances that notice appears, that you started by objecting to.  That seems to me to matter a lot, because as far as I can see it would be trivially easy to simply suppress the message &amp;mdash;just one example of simple measures that could be taken to completely eradicate various drawbacks of flaggedrevs&amp;mdash; but I wouldn't want to suppress it without knowing what situations would be affected by the suppression.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:39, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

::::: I wonder how or even if flaggedrevs works for files from Wikimedia Commons. If it works like locally uploaded files, I think it should continue to apply to the Files namespace too. If it work differently from locally uploaded files, I wonder what the difference(s) is/are. If files from Wikimedia Commons are ignored than there really is no point to keeping it enabled for the Files namespace. Another possible consideration is if is Wikimedia Commons has or plans to use flaggedrevs for their files and if so would sight revisions of files be used across projects over unsighted revisions? I think having some answers would allow us to make better decisions for the files namespace. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:23, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

:::: Assigning reviewer permissions to the editor flag and renaming editor in the interface to reviewer sounds like it could work. I also like the sound of being able to keep the three meaningful levels that flagedrevs has sighted, quality and pristine which is why I suggested three levels to begin with. Only since we are dealing with &quot;quality&quot; as a rating criteria they would refer to acceptable quality, good quality, and excellent quality respectively. Although maybe average quality might make more sense than acceptable quality. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:52, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

:::::Wikinews found they were only using the editor bit, and they thought calling it &quot;editor&quot; was confusing anyway, so they renamed &quot;reviewer&quot; to &quot;super-reviewer&quot;, renamed &quot;editor&quot; to &quot;reviewer&quot;, and then deprecated super-reviewer.  How does this suggestion compare/contrast to that?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:06, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

=== Page sighting ===

{{question}} I seem to recall being told in some earlier discussion that admins can switch between showing the most recent sighted version and showing the most recent version whether it's sighted or not.  Is that correct (and if so, what's the handle for it &amp;mdash; and is it per page or per book)?  The reason I'm asking now is that this seems to me to be a possible key element for counter-proposals.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:45, 26 June 2010 (UTC)
: Yes that is correct, that is changeable per page because like most extensions it wasn't designed with books in mind. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:57, 26 June 2010 (UTC)
::If we could have anything we wanted, it seems to me we would want the ''default'' behavior to be that on Wikijunior, files, and templates, the most recent sighted version is shown, while on mainspace and cookbook the most recent version is shown regardless of whether it's sighted.  Assuming we can't have that, the next best choice would seem to be that the most recent version is shown by default, and we manually set all the Wikijunior pages to show the most recent sighted version (a largish job, but nothing compared to the other way around that would require manually reconfiguring every page on mainspace and cookbook).  Indeed, once that was in place we might want to turn back on $wgFlaggedRevsAutoReviewNew.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:48, 26 June 2010 (UTC)
:::At least for the latter, {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;$wgFlaggedRevsOverride {{=}} false&lt;/tt&gt;}} would be the option to use. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 17:19, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

=== Auto review ===

I'm curious about a recent addition Darklama added.  You want to turn off autoreview for sysops but not anyone else?  Why would feedback be enabled for templates? Why are editors getting rollback? Also, removing &lt;tt&gt;validate&lt;/tt&gt; from sysops means they won't be able to review at the top level, or so I was led to believe. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:13, 26 June 2010 (UTC)
:: I thought autoreview would be turned off already for everyone else. Templates are used on pages, feedback on their usefulness could be useful. I noticed that often if someone makes a request for the editor flag they also often ask for rollback, and Wikinews give rollback to editors, since we are cutting steps I thought it would be a good idea to do that here as well. Wikinews doesn't have validate on for its configuration and the only proposed difference between us and them is what we want to call this one criteria. I think:
::* $wgFlagRestrictions = array( 'quality' =&gt; array('review' =&gt; 2, 'autoreview' =&gt; 2), );
::* $wgGroupPermissions['sysop']['review'] = true;
:: makes the top level accessible to sysops. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:52, 26 June 2010 (UTC)
:::If I edit a sighted revision I want my edit to be sighted too, automatically.  Wikinews specifically wanted that off for editors/reviewers and sysops to have others sight the edit as part of some double-check; we don't have the manpower for that. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:03, 26 June 2010 (UTC)
:::Without validate, you can't limit the top level to sysops.  Without review added to sysops, admins will not be automatically reviewers; they will have to specifically members of that group.  The FlagRestrictions will depend on the levels and whether any is limited to a group with &quot;validate&quot;. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:15, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

{{outdent|::::}}It's not essential, but if we don't use it, then we don't need FlagRestrictions, only FlagRevTags. And if we don't restrict the top level, then we probably don't need so many review levels. After all, how many people will then care if it's at excellent versus good if you can't change the settings to show excellent, then good.  It'd just be limited to showing most recent (default with above code) or stable (changed by admins 
for Wikijunior). &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:36, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

What became of the&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;$wgContentNamespaces {{=}} NS_MAIN, 102, 110;&lt;/tt&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; suggestion?

Did it get lost in the shuffle?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 20:07, 26 June 2010 (UTC)
: Looks that way. I added it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:15, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

=== Files ===
Broadly I'm happy with the current proposal. On the file namespace, it might be useful to have FlaggedRevs on as I have, for example, used it to indicate for FU images that the rationale had been checked and was complete. We will always have some files hosted here. Don't turn it off for the Cookbook, not after I spent two months reviewing the whole thing ;-) &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:11, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

:I didn't add that line to the box because it will go into [http://noc.wikimedia.org/conf/InitialiseSettings.php.txt another configuration file] other than the [http://noc.wikimedia.org/conf/flaggedrevs.php.txt one linked above].  But we can have it there as a reminder.  Along that line, I suggest that feedback namespaces match up with content namespaces.  Templates aren't supposed to be seen directly, so readers shouldn't be visiting them to provide feedback.  Additionally, how would one rate a template on reliability, completeness, neutrality, and presentation... &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:38, 26 June 2010 (UTC)
:: I think you meant this as a rhetorical question, but I decided I would answer anyways. A template is reliable if it works as documented. A template is complete if people feel there is no missing functionality. A template is neutral if it can be used in many contexts. A template's presentation can be judged many ways like is the style good, is the appearance pleasing to the eyes, does the template convey its information in a meaningful and useful way? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:58, 26 June 2010 (UTC)
:::That's an interesting analysis, but it seems to me that the templates that would have enough content to possibly be non-neutral are likely going to be book-specific anyways, and the ones that don't have enough content to be anything but neutral are going to be as interesting as, say, {{tl|BookCat}}. 

=== Problems switching to single criteria ===

A thought occurred to me just now, however, in that we should maybe use &lt;tt&gt;accuracy&lt;/tt&gt; for &lt;tt&gt;$wgFlaggedRevTags&lt;/tt&gt; internally and change the display of it in the interface to &quot;quality&quot;, as I'm worried that if we change all the internal values all the currently sighted pages will be reset to unsighted. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:25, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

:: They would likely need to be reset anyways going from 3 criteria to 1. Which might be one consideration against switching from 3 to 1. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:12, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

::: The two removed would just leave additional values in the database that would no longer be used.  I think going to one criterion, with the internal label of that the same as one of the criteria used before, will work out. And that should change it to radio buttons instead of drop down menus. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 23:30, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

:::::Checking out the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:AdvancedReviewLog&amp;namespace=0&amp;level=-1&amp;user=&amp;status=1&amp;automatic=0 review log] for manual reviews, it would appear that the majority of them are using the default values selected in the drop-down menus; that is, the lowest rating that reviews the page.  In other cases where the rating is higher, all the menus are set to the same numerical value. Thus whether the value that gets assigned to quality had been originally assigned to accuracy, composition, or coverage ought to not matter in the vast majority of cases. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 23:48, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

:::::: If order is what determines it and not the name, than we should be fine using &quot;quality&quot; internally.

=== Test Trial ===

I've been flowing this discussion and as expected and as I always claim in this topic. Things are being done in reverse. The flagged revision was (and still is) a test trial, that was what was proposed and adopted, it has been continuously tweaked with or without consensus especially in the first months. It has failed satisfy all the requirements it was meant to address (except the reduction of vandalism) and even the proponent of the test of system has expressed the wish to see it terminated.

The experience I have on the subject is as a user and is commonsense, the more complex or nonstanrd a system is, the less I want to use it. Unless I'm obligated or get a sufficient reward for going trough all the loops and the learning curve. In a volunteering basis this seems simple enough to be categorized as a barrier for participation.

Empirically I also noted a decrease in contributions especially from unregistered users and a reduction of vandalism (bear in mind that vandalism edits have always been low and under control here).

The system adoption has also some added controversy. Most of the defendants of the new system are the ones that are directly benefiting from it. If a real benefit exists. Consistent editors and mostly users in administrative tasks, are in general terms a minority of the community, but the active majority.

With the system on, consistent editors get a level of power over revisions this is especially interesting to people dedicated to a specific tasks but it also alienates newcomers. Another clearly obvious issue is that the system is not designed for our (project) it was designed for Wikipedia (this has several implications and consideration some of the changes needed were already covered before and Darklama enumerated very interesting concepts on that regard). There are other implications, even the recent decline in administrators can be correlated with the evaporation of the page patrol system, as most of the admins did came from Wikibookians participating on those types of tasks...

In regards to the proposed changes I wish that any change, if to keep the &quot;new&quot; system, has a low impact and preserves the works already put into it (I did spend considerable time reviewing and categorizing pages).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:29, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

: You've stated this before, but after doing a thorough read of the talk on [[Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs Extension]] and through reading room archives prior to the date of implementation, I cannot find anything saying it was temporary.  From the amount of discussion, I might say it was implemented without much actual discussion, but I don't see anything on a trial period. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:51, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

:: I think I might know what Panic is talking about. There was some discussion about the FlaggedRevs extension on IRC prior to discussion on wiki. Panic and I both voiced concerns about its use, and some other people suggested that the extension could always be disabled later if it turns out the extension isn't as useful as hoped. After that it was mostly just agreeing to have some initial configuration that could always be changed later too. I had also voiced the opinion on IRC that Wikibooks would be better off in the long run using something else. All that might be where Panic is coming from with the idea that the extension was meant to be a temporary setup maybe. However I refuse to get dragged into an argument on whether the idea of FlaggedRevs being temporary was ever the case or because of differences in interpretation of past events, anyone involved could of left that discussion with a different idea of what was to happen. In any case &quot;temporary&quot; is ambiguous and could be a long time for a wiki and with time new people can have different plans for something initially planned to be &quot;temporary&quot; and a new consensus can develop which has happened already several times with FlaggedRevs. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 04:08, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

=== Document Changes in English ===

I understand most of the stuff in the proposal, but not all of it... can someone translate that into plain English too? (I don't think I have the ability to read through this long discussion...) [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 02:13, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

:I've added a summary in plain English just underneath the code that has been hammered out so far. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 04:06, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

I've added additional configuration options for reader feedback; namely, to increase the length of time ratings of a page are valid for.  The default is a week.  That's too short for our level of activity, so I set it to 60 days. It could be increased further. I also decreased the threshold of reviews for an average rating to be determined, from 15 to 10.  That could be decreased further. Both of these are not firm, but I don't believe the default values would be acceptable for Wikibooks. Also, we need to determine if the default to have anonymous users be able to rate is acceptable.  Additionally, do we want the default rating options and how much weight do we give each of them?  The default is &lt;tt&gt;$wgFeedbackTags = array('reliability' =&gt; 3,'completeness' =&gt; 2,'npov' =&gt; 2,'presentation' =&gt; 1);&lt;/tt&gt;, with a higher number giving that criterion greater weight. Do we want fewer/different criteria or different weights? &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 04:41, 27 June 2010 (UTC)
: Yes I think anonymous users should be able to rate pages, that is the whole point in enabling it most readers are going to be anonymous. Unlike FlaggedRevs, ReaderFeedback just provides information that lets contributors know how well they are doing, it doesn't effect what people are shown. I thought about proposing &lt;tt&gt;$wgFeedbackTags = array( 'quality' =&gt; 1 );&lt;/tt&gt; but with tags being weighted I dunno what sort of effect a single tag would have on that extension. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 05:01, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

* I believe that 60 days is a bit short - most of our pages are not particularly popular. Extend that to 180?
* I believe 10 reviews is a bit too high - perhaps 5?
Other than these two I see no objection to the proposal. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 08:04, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

&lt;s&gt; I would like to have this clearly stated on the [[Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs Extension]], not as a policy or guideline but as the generally accepted and as the consistent practice. Since the flags (editor and reviewer) aren't really covered by any policy or any other text except from what is stated on the [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]] since it will now include rollback ability a defined way to remove the flags must be provided in a stable text.&lt;s&gt;   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:05, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

:: I'm supporting my interpretation of the issues Thenub314 raised, and expressed my requirements to have the opposition removed. I don't see an issue on not having rollback clarified since abuse of the tool will be categorized as vandalism. On the other hand I see as a need to have an agreement on what consists non compliance with the quality of the revision system (by editors and reviewers) and what would constitute acceptable grounds for removal of the flags to preserve the value of the system.

I have now satisfied my reason to object to the proposal (lack of clarity) with the help of Adrignola. The page [[Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs Extension/Unstable]] makes it now intelligible and attempts to remove any required technical background by restating the proposal as  defined in [{{fullurl:Wikibooks:Reading room/General#Reconfigure Wikibooks|oldid=1868918}} rev 1868918] (as indicated in the majority of the supporting votes). My neutral position is because I'm not comfortable with two aspects. Granting admins the exclusive right to decide what constitutes excellent/feature material (putting the classification under a personal decision), I would support it if the use of that upper qualification was based on an open decision process. And second, the freedom granted to them regarding filters (it has also other implications since automation will put stress on other practices like user blocks for instance). I fear that without proper scrutinizing the changes, there will be errors made, able to have serious impact on the project, it also depends on how quickly we notice them and how we chose to resolve them. Overall the proposal is an improvement on what we have now, it democratizes some processes, removes redundancy and seemingly all barriers to participation I've lamented about. There will be need for corrections later on but at present I've nothing to object.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:53, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

=== KISS ===

I am joining this conversation a bit late unfortunately.  For what it is worth I am strongly in favor of removing Flagged Revisions on main space pages, in my experience it causes more problems then it is worth and is alienating to new editors.  I suspect they see Flagged Revisions as a type of approval of their edits, (see this comment [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AReading_room%2FProjects&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=1842943&amp;oldid=1831671 for example]) and since so few people actively review things they never receive any sense of approval.  Whether or not this causes them to leave I do not know, but in the case of this comment that expression of frustration was the last edit he made here.  Also in my recent attempts to shorten the old reviewed pages, it is clear that pages that get marked as sighted are not always read, just scanned for any obvious vandalism, no present then accept.  This seems to me the wrong tool for this job.  

It should be kept on wikijuinor, and a lot of work as gone into the cookbook which shouldn't be wasted.

I also don't like new pages to be reviewed by default.  I have in the past only noticed it later and then had to spend time unreviewing pages, which is annoying.  So I would like to see the default to have new pages be unsighted. 

I will think a bit more about reader feedback.  But I think it goes against Kayau's KISS philosophy, and I am worried that it will further push away editors.  I worry that, rather than encouraging readers to  fix problems themselves, they may feel they can just leave a bad review and let the people here fix it and we could loose out on editors as a result.

: The first item in the summary &amp;mdash;showing the most recent version instead of the most recent sighted version&amp;mdash; seems to me to be a game changer, as far as the effect of flaggedrevs on mainspace is concerned.  (Which is why I suggested it; I've had it in mind since the last time the configuration of flaggedrevs came up, and would have suggested it then except that that discussion was clearly petering out without changing anything.  Since we're serious about making changes this time, this time I suggested it.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 11:24, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

:::Examining [[Special:ListGroupRights]] and comparing it with Wikinews', we need to make additional tweaks to support reviewers with rollbacker.  Having reviewers get rollback automatically makes the separate group for rollbacker pointless, as who would get rollback assigned if they hadn't even done enough to become a reviewer.  And if you think about it, if you're reviewing pages, you'll need a way to quickly undo vandalism at the same time.  So I changed the above to remove the separate rollbacker group now that the only right assigned to that group is assigned to the reviewer group.  I also suggest removing the patroller group, as it is not used with flagged revisions; all the namespaces that would use page patrol have been overridden by flagged revisions.  This makes us match up with Wikinews.  See [[n:Special:ListGroupRights]] to compare. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:13, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

:::::Although I think the autopromotion criteria aren't off by ''much'', and I wouldn't be upset if we just left them alone, I do think we might lower the number of edit intervals needed (&quot;benchmarks&quot;) from 10 to 8.  My purely subjective impression is that when someone requests the bit because they're impatient waiting for autopromotion, and their case has some merit, the hold-up is usually that they're a bit shy on that number.  Going from 10 to 8 might therefore make a substantial difference.  Changing that number from 15 to 10 was my suggestion, to fix a massive problem with autopromotion being much too sluggish, and I think it worked quite well (compared to what things were like before).  The number 10 was meant to be a substantial enough change to drastically reduce the misadjustment without going overboard, but I figured when I suggested it that by putting us into the right ballpark it might allow us to make a more precise estimate for fine-tuning it later.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 21:36, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

::::::: Really I think we didn't get many requests that wasn't satisfied automatically soon after. Some people were a bit impatient or felt they shouldn't have to wait to become an editor. I think the later is likely due to the name being misleading which we are already proposing to fix. Having all 3 content namespaces count towards promotion as proposed already as well should also help those that mostly or only contribute to the cookbook or the wikijunior namespace. I really don't see a need to lower the intervals because of these other changes, but I'm also not really going to urge that it not be done at the same time. Since we are proposing changes to auto promote now, I think what would be helpful is to lower the number of contributions that need to be present in recent changes at the time of the promotion check from 10 to 5. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:34, 28 June 2010 (UTC)

=== Importer group ===
It occurs to me that Internoob in the above section may feel left out in all this.  So I've added the code for adding people to the &quot;transwiki importer&quot; group. Additionally, the &quot;importer&quot; group is unused and the only technical difference is importing via a file.  That group currently cannot be granted either.  So, like the &quot;editor&quot;/&quot;reviewer&quot; groups above, I suggest removing the &quot;importer&quot; group and then renaming the &quot;transwiki importer&quot; group to &quot;importer&quot;, for simplicity and matching up with the &quot;uploader&quot; group. There have been two recent requests for this and they could not be fulfilled even if we wanted to.  So I suggest we enable the technical means to do so and determine in the future how we apply it either generally per policy discussion or per situation. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:05, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

:No response on [[mw:Extension:AbuseFilter|Extension:AbuseFilter]], just as before when I had it by itself as a proposal.  Well, I added code to the above that would enable it; please comment if you object, as I can't read minds.  [[w:Special:AbuseFilter]] shows possible entries that would stop vandalism in its tracks by detecting clear vandalism, such as page blanking, adding &quot;poop&quot; to pages, or writing in all caps.  Such would reduce the burden on reviewers by preventing such edits from being made in the first place.  It'd also more appropriate to rename it &quot;edit filter&quot; in the interface. Actions taken can include slowing a user down, flagging their edits with a tag in the page history, showing a warning to the user (most common), or even preventing the edit entirely.  Those actions and what to detect are entirely customizable by administrators; but none of that is possible if it's not enabled in the first place.  If desired, a new group can also be added to allow others to edit filters. I can't prove it on wiki, but when I discussed this extension in IRC in the past, both Darklama and Mike.lifeguard were in favor of it. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:33, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

:It allows importing from an XML file.  Unsetting it means the currently-named &quot;importers&quot; group should disappear.  It will clean up [[Special:ListGroupRights]] with groups not used not listed; same with removing the patroller group.  Keep in mind that not even administrators can import from a file&amp;mdash;they can only transwiki import, and nobody can be added to the currently-named &quot;importers&quot; group.  So in practice nothing will change but we'll be able to rename &quot;transwiki importers&quot; to the shorter &quot;importers&quot; without having the unused group of that same name hanging around. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:23, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

=== Rollbacker ===

According to the proposal the rollbacker right will be removed so it's part of reviewer. However, I a worried that some editors may use it to roll back edits that are not blatant vandalism. If one continues to misuse the right, we warn them, and they still misuse rollback, then we must remove his reviewer right as well. Won't that be a bit inflexible?

:If they're misusing rollback then I wouldn't trust them with the ability to review either.

::Adrignola, if a reviewer is autopromoted because all (s)he does is work on one book, and is not involved with the community, doesn't know what rollback does etc, then (s)he can easily mistake rollback for undo.

=== Thenub314's position ===

I thought I restate my opinions for ease of reading.  I am mostly in favor of the changes to FlaggedRev's but I don't think we should have new pages be sighted by default, particularly when in the past we were of the opinion books could opt into flagged revs if they want, the new configuration sounds like books would have to consistently work at opting out.  I oppose implementing Reader Feedback, which should be a separate conversation to be a separate conversation and not bundled into the changes with Flagged Revs. I also would hope to discuss further the possibility of turning off Flagged Revs on the Main space pages, but I can see that this is a long shot, nonetheless it should be discussed. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:14, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

: Regarding turning off flaggedrevs on mainspace, I'll clarify my position:  I think having the latest revision shown by default changes the psychology so drastically that there is no grounds for extrapolation to the psychodynamics of the proposed configuration (specifically, whether or not it would discourage casual contributors) based on any observed (or perceived, it doesn't really matter which) psychodynamics of the current configuration.  Not trying the proposed configuration (I'm only talking about the two issues of default view and on/off, here) would simply mean giving up without knowing whether one is justified in doing so.  The psychodynamics of the current configuration is an entirely unnecessary question if it can't be extrapolated to the proposed configuration.

: On Wikijunior, AutoReviewNew is clearly preferable, IMO, as the first thing we (almost) always want to do when a page is created at WJ is get it into adequate shape to sight, so that we don't have unreviewed pages lying around there.  Elsewhere, the point of viewing the current version by default is to make it okay for there to be an earlier version that is sighted, thus removing what I believe to be a major reason there aren't more pages on mainspace that ''have'' sighted versions.  I, for one, stopped sighting previously unsighted mainspace pages a long time ago, exactly because I didn't want to be constantly under the gun to very rapidly review changes to every last one of them.  Flaggedrevs might be far more widely used and more effective, ''as well'' as not discouraging to new users, with the latest draft shown by default &amp;mdash; and then, failing to autoreviewnew would simply be preventing a potentially effective tool from being (as) actually effective.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:45, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

I see no need to consider this as bundling things together. Configuration changes can take awhile to be acted on when a bug request is filled out. I think letting them know all the changed we want at once will make their job easier. I have clarified the summary in hopes that people can better understand what the changes will mean. I also made one change. I noticed bureaucrats could remove the flood group, but not add it. Since flood is intended to be used temperately as an alternative of the bot group, I think administrators should be able to add and remove it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:05, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

Continuing with what Pi Zero had said I do admit the making the most recent version the one that is visible by default does definitely change the impact it will have on new users. So I will try not to extrapolate.  But the more I think about this the more confused I get. If the flagged revision is not shown by default, then Flagged Revs is no longer seen as a deterrent to vandalism.  Nor is it being used to make sure we are in general putting forth high quality content.  I suppose interested users could hunt through the edit history to make sure they have good quality version of the page.  And some registered users could make this their default preference.

I also find it a bit disturbing that any new page a that gets created will be sighted, and may go on being automatically sighted as average quality without anyone ever checking it over.  Over all, on pages that show the draft version by default I am not sure what Flagged Revs is helping to do for anyone beyond creating another maintenance task to keep up with.  And there is still the issue that it will get used as a vandalism patrol because we don't have any other tool for that, the result being that our average quality article will simply mean &quot;vandalism free&quot; even if the grammar, formatting, etc is atrocious.  This sounds a bit harsher then I mean it to, but I am confused about what we are hoping Flagged Revs will accomplish for the main namespace in the current setup.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 21:49, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

: ''Only new pages'' created by ''a reviewer'' will be sighted as average, not any new page. Part of this proposal also includes '''AbuseFilter''' which will provide us ''a tool for vandalism'', and may help reduce motivation to use '''FlaggedRevs''' for ''vandalism patrol''. FlaggedRevs will accomplish nothing in the main namespace in the proposed setup ''unless people ask to be opt into it''. If people are asking to use FlaggedRevs, there will hopefully be reviewers to ensure that average means more than vandalism free. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:09, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

:That's not harsh.  That's exactly how I view it and use it, at least in the main space, much of the time.  I've used it for templates like QuiteUnusual has for the Cookbook, but in the main space, I view it for vandalism patrol.  However, I've seen that there'd be resistance to turning it off, and with it in place in the main space, we avoid the need for a &quot;patroller&quot; group.  With three levels and proper tagging in place for each, you will be able to go to [[Special:ReviewedPages]] and view &quot;average&quot; (vandalism-free), &quot;good&quot; (higher than base by reviewer), or &quot;excellent/featured&quot; (marked only by admins for stable versions of featured books). &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:22, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

:: I think we ought to be harsh against the use of FlaggedRevs for vandalism patrolling and viewing it as vandalism tool. IMO that has been a big part of the problem. Even with FlaggedRevs not showing specific revisions, people can look through a page's history and see what revisions are considered good and choose to read a revision marked as good or excellent. I honestly don't understand why there isn't a tab available to let people switch between a draft and stable version though, that would give people a choice. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:31, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

: The first change will in practice remove flanged revision, the degradation of the system for readers and the &quot;wall&quot; for anonymous contributors. I suppose that &quot;Anonymous/Unregistered users see the current revision instead of the latest reviewed revision, except when overridden by administrators.&quot; means that in vandalized or stable works (low level of edits) admins will reactivate it. So I see it as an overall benefit.
: The second is more problematic but required, I also expect that it will increase the responsibility to editors, since it only affects users with a flag I expect that consistent disregard for quality will result on removing the flag (a non problem since the user wasn't really using it).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:07, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

To reply to something DL was telling me earlier.  Thanks for clearing up that it is new pages reviewers make that get sighted.  That doesn't really affect the problem I have with it.   Maybe I should have phrased my sentence as &quot;I find it disturbing any new page ''I create'' ...&quot;, because the first time I hit save the only quality I feel I can guarantee is vandalism free.  My English is terrible, my sense of still is bizarre and I am very prone to errors.  And I don't usually trust other people more than myself. So, I wouldn't want to see new pages get sighted automatically regardless of the users permissions.

=== Flood group ===

I am tempted to oppose the recent change.  It was already such that administrators could add and remove the flood flag ''from themselves''.  Bureaucrats could remove the flag if an administrator has gone rogue or forgotten to take the flag off.  Allowing administrators to apply the flood flag to anyone allows them to circumvent bureaucrats and make anyone the equivalent of a bot.  On the other hand, the cumulative changes to rights management above already do quite a bit to marginalize the bureaucrat group and maybe that's the point... &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:28, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

: Actually I've never been able add and remove the flood group on myself, so that isn't the case. I'd be fine with changing it back, but I don't see the point in bureaucrats being able to remove it without being able to add it too, since they wouldn't be able to undo themselves if they made a mistake. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:57, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

::That's strange, because [[Special:ListGroupRights]] says that you should be able to add/remove the pseudo-bot flag on yourself. Our project policy is that you can't become a bureaucrat unless you're an administrator, so any bureaucrat would be able to add it back on to themselves if they removed it from themselves, by virtue of administrator group membership.  If you're thinking they might accidentally remove it from an admin who assigned it to themselves and be unable to reassign it, that would be possible with the current configuration.  But that could be solved by having bureaucrats be able to assign the pseudo-bot flag to anyone.  The current configuration assumes that the community would never trust anyone but an admin with the ability to vanish from recent changes without the full-blown discussion associated with the bot flag. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:15, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

Granting it is, to me, a high-impact decision, and by convention those rest with bureaucrat group.  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:59, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

: As long as the most recent version is shown by default, I don't see any strong line between using flaggedrevs for tracking quality and using flaggedrevs as an anti-vandalism tool.  The most basic level of quality control is absence of vandalism.  I see flaggedrevs at its most basic as a bookkeeping tool for anti-vandalism.  When we made the big push to sight all of Wikijunior, for instance, I found that some pages had above-graffiti-grade vandalism that had gotten woven into their revision histories ''years'' before, apparently because there was such a long period between when the edit was made and when someone more responsible next came along, that they didn't look closely at a long-standing edit that wasn't glaringly obvious vandalism.  In a situation like that in mainspace under the proposed configuration, when a reviewer does come along, even if it's many months later, they'll ''know'' that there's a particular edit that hasn't been vetted yet.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 22:45, 29 June 2010 (UTC)

=== As vandalism tool ===

So it sounds like several of us think it is appropriate to use flagged revs as an vandalism patrol tool.  In fact, we sort of have to, we don't any other way to mark pages as vandalism free to keep the people patrolling recent changes from checking the same thing multiple times.  So why don't we call a spade a spade, if the lowest level is really only to mean &quot;valdalism free&quot;, let's call it exactly that instead of &quot;average&quot;.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:28, 30 June 2010 (UTC) 

::Group names, revisions levels; they're all configurable in the MediaWiki namespace.  That's not something that should block the proposal. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:57, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

::: &quot;Vandalism free&quot; isn't friendly and is harsh. The point seems to be to have a minimal level of quality that is below average but has been checked. In which case I'd rather just keep using 4 levels (like now) for 'quality', and just call them minimal, average, good, and excellent. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:03, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

::: I guess alternatively could stay at 3 levels and call them minimal, average and good, since Wikibooks is already using good books and featured books somewhat as synonyms . --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:31, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

:::: I agree that a name isn't something that should block the proposal.  But not having a clear sense of what we want this tool to accomplish for us is a reason to put the breaks on.  I am proposing we try to come to a consensus about whether or not this the bottom level be for marking pages as free of vandalism (regaurdless of what we call it).  If that is its purpose on the main space the I can understand having it there.  If we do not use Flagged Revs for vandalism patrol we should disable flagged revs on main space pages so we can use existing patrolling tools, because in my opinion patrolling for vandalism is more important than having a page somewhere in the history that is flagges as &quot;we thought this was good&quot;.  I am sure others disagree with me on this point, but honestly I see that as being little benefit to anyone.  It does gives a new way to semi-lock pages and that is nice, but so very vital.  But lots of people seem to be reading through the RC list looking for vandalism and giving a way to coordinate the effor would be a good idea.  

=== Reader Feedback ===

(returning) Here are some my issues with reader feedback, and please correct me if I misunderstand something.

* Grids at the bottom of every page are disrupting to a contiguous text.  Especially large grids with stars like wikinews has, but even smaller ones would break up the flow of a book.
* As most books/modules have no one working on them.  The vast majority of cases no one will read or act upon the reviews.  I suppose I am trying to say it is not so helpful a tool for us, perhaps latter if there are more editors running around.   All I see this doing is creating a big red flag saying &quot;Yes most of modules are under developed.&quot; 
* I feel it will discourage new contributions. Rather than being bold fixing a problem with a page readers are being it encourages readers simply to give it a poor rating and hope the books (non-existant) author will fix it.

Unfortunately I am guessing I have not made a convincing case to remove ReaderFeedback from this round of changes.  But I can offer at least one idea about how to change the configuration.  Since I haven't had time to read threw the mediawiki doc's forgive me if this is nonesenical.  But instead of turning it on in the Main and Wikijunior namespaces turn it on in the corresponding discussion name spaces.  This way the rating will not break up the text, removing the first issue I mentioned.  I also think if a reader is mature enough to go to the discussion page it is more likely they will still be bold and edit the page anyways, so I am less concerned about the third point.  The cookbook is a separate case, and I think reader feedback would be good there in every respect, and should appear on the recipe pages and not their talk pages.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 22:08, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

:* How is it any more disrupting to a contiguous text than categories or flaggedrevs at the bottom of pages? Maybe some styling could help with that?
:* I'm skeptical of any theories concerning Wikibooks' activity level, and disagree with using it as a reason to do or not do something. What is wrong with knowing whether or not people think most of Wikibooks' modules are under developed? If that were the case it could possibly help us to do something about it, which I think would be a good thing.
:* People can leave feedback on the discussion page or add maintenance templates to pages without contributing any content to pages. How is providing a means to do so directly on pages any different?
: Enabling reader feedback on discussion pages instead sounds reasonable to me, I can't think of any reasons not to atm. Why is the cookbook a separate case? Why should the cookbook be treated differently? How do your concerns not apply to the cookbook? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:56, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

* The idea of calling the minimal acceptable level &quot;minimal&quot;, or something of that sort, appeals to me.  I wonder if we can come up with a better choice, but &quot;minimal&quot; conveys the sense of what I'd like that level to mean, and as pointed out, finding a better choice for the same meaning doesn't have to hold up this proposal.  (Addendum: It seems obvious rereading that that &quot;acceptable&quot; is a contender.)
* Notwithstanding my slightly melodramatic remarks earlier about AutoReviewNew, I suggested turning it on because I really didn't think there would be any harm in doing so once the most recent draft is shown.  Although for my own use I'd somewhat prefer to have it on, since Thenub gives a perfectly respectable reason why they'd rather have it stay off, I'm willing to go along with leaving it off.  (This is similar to why Wikinews recently disabled autoreview &amp;mdash; of course it's in the nature of their different use of flaggedrevs that they'd already had AutoReviewNew turned off.)
* I have no commitment to the feedback thing; although I've been vaguely skeptical, I didn't have any clear objections worth opposing it.  I'm very foggy on the details of it, really, although it's my understanding that those over at Wikinews who do track it have been ''extremely'' pleased with it.  Which doesn't necessarily mean anything about whether it's appropriate here.  &lt;s&gt;However, if we're willing to relegate it to the talk page (which I'd think might not work anyway unless one turned on flaggedrevs for the talk spaces &amp;mdash; but I too haven't RTFM) &amp;mdash; if we're willing to relegate it to the talk page, I think I may be opposed to it altogether, because where Thenub has suggested it would compete with actually improving the page, I see it as competing with the talk page.  If people are coming to the talk page at all, either on their own or because we directed them there, it makes more sense to me that they should just comment on the talk page, which is simpler.&lt;/s&gt;
--[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 23:43, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

: I'm fine with leaving AutoReviewNew off as well. I've been pleased with what I've seen of ReaderFeedback on Wikinews as well. ReaderFeedback is not dependent in any way on FlaggedRevs being enabled anywhere, unless the documentation I've read has simply failed to mention a dependency on it. ReaderFeedback provides graphs that show how reader feedback has changed over time, much in the same way as the [http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/EN/PlotsPngWikipediansContributors.htm contributors graphs] shows how contributions to Wikibooks has changed over time. I remember a time when Wikibooks has a lot more graphical statistics which IMO contributed greatly to community growth and participation. Wikibooks only stopped doing that because the format of database dumps changed. Wikibooks use to have a top 10 list of most active books that was updated each month with how far books jumped or dropped in activity since the previous month for example. I don't think we can really say whether ReaderFeedback will be good for us or not without giving it a try. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:24, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

::I'll concede that there's no real competition between the talk page and ReaderFeedback.  I have doubts about whether the talk page idea can work (granted, the idea that it had anything at all to do with flaggrevs was almost certainly daft).  It looks to me as if one would have to make the talk spaces rateable ''instead of'' the content pages associated with them &amp;mdash; and then one would also have to make sure that a talk page was actually created for every single content page.  That doesn't seem very practical.  (If one ''could'' make the talk page idea work, one might wish the feedback were at the top of the talk page rather than the bottom.)

::Of Thenub's three bulleted concerns about ReaderFeedback,
::* The second bullet doesn't work for me.  It's not clear to me that having lots of underdeveloped pages presents any problem for feedback that it didn't already present for its own sake.  As for the rest, if someone comes along and decides to spend some time on an inactive book, the accumulated feedback would be no less useful to them than to someone who had been working on that book all along.
::* On the third bullet, we really don't want anything to interfere with a visitor investing that small bit of effort to make their first edit.
::* On the first bullet, non-reviewers don't see any junk at the bottom of the page because of flaggedrevs (only reviewers are treated to that); and there's no analogy with Wikinews on this since (a)&amp;nbsp;Wikinews doesn't have the continuity concerns of a book and (b)&amp;nbsp;Wikinews already has sources and &quot;share this&quot; icons at the bottom of each article.
::It does occur to me, in passing, that ''if'' it were possible to put the feedback machinery on the lefthand sidebar, that would eliminate the continuity problem, and might go a long way to redress the discouraging-from-edits problem too since the feedback would feel like more of a separate issue from the actual content.  (I see no evidence that that's remotely possible, but suggesting that it isn't possible would be getting into esoterica that are well beyond me.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 01:53, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

{{outdent|::::}}Let me answer some questions directly asked to me.  First to Panic, yes I think you had the idea of my concerns that it was not clear to me what we where attempting to do with Flagged Revs.  Mostly my concerns were about the bottom flag, and it sounds to me your asking the subtler questions of &quot;When do we demote/promote a module?&quot; and you want to set down clearly at least what our goal is in [[WB:FlaggedRevs Extension]]. But I do think we are in the same ball park of &quot;What are we going for?&quot;  

Let me try to answer Dark Lama's questions in the order asked. 

* &quot;''How is it any more disrupting to a contiguous text than categories or flaggedrevs at the bottom of pages?''&quot; Currently, internal to most books the only category that appears is one corresponding to the books name.  This is very easy to passively ignore just as are headers with the title or section in a dead tree book.  Adding a feedback form is specifically seeking for the reader to stop reading/thinking about the books material and start thinking about its quality before moving on to the next page.  This seems to me a bit distracting.  Any styling that would help would necessarily come at the cost of making the feedback form less visible to the reader, and result in less feedback.  But yes some balance could be struck.  I was hoping the talk page would be good.  This is currently where the [[WB:WikiProject Languages]] is placing their rating schemes which made me think it might be the right place for ReaderFeedback ratings as well.    
* &quot;''What is wrong with knowing whether or not people think most of Wikibooks' modules are under developed?''&quot; Nothing really, it is the truth of the matter.  At the same time I don't want to over emphasize that fact  either, in the fear that people have the impression that this is a dying project.  I have personally given up on and avoided wiki's that had &quot;bitten off more then they could chew&quot;.  Mostly because I recognize how difficult it would be when something happend to finally bring the project to an end. (I would have been crushed if I were an active Simple English Wikibooks editor at the time the wiki was locked.)  I recognize it is folly to think that there are other people like me, or to predict behavior of groups on what I feel.  At the same time it is still something I am concerned about, and I think it is a reasonable concern, so I mention it.   
* &quot;''People can leave feedback on the discussion page or add maintenance templates to pages without contributing any content to pages. How is providing a means to do so directly on pages any different?''&quot; Again I suppose it is personal experience, after having shown a few people where the edit and discussion tabs are I am left with the opinion that &quot;If you've noticed that a discussion tab, you've probably noticed the edit tab as well.  And you know you can contribute.  On the other hand if your annoyed enough with something being of poor quality then you look for the tools to fix it.&quot; 
* ''Why is the cookbook a separate case?'' The structure of it is so very different from the other things here.  For one thing all of the recipes I have seen are complete and on one module, and there by and large no ordering to its pages.  My comments about interrupting continuity simply do not apply. For another thing it is difficult to tell the quality of a recipe before cooking the meal.  So ReaderFeedback will of a greater benefit to readers and contributors in a way that it would not be for other books, because it is very difficult to assess quality simply by reading.  

--[[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:38, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

: Thanks for the reply. I think that most supporting votes are at this moment in a possition of selecting the less of two evils, it is clear that FlaggeRdevs has no real function other that the reduction of vandalism and that can only work if we make it dificult to contribute content. So the real choise is between attemt yet again an alteration (that functionally removes FlaggedRevs) or acepting to stop using it.
: I've never been a supporter of the scheme as permanent, that wasn't what I approved, and after all the implications became clear and as we started stated that we are doing it wrong. I particularly don't approve this adhoc process for passing high impact decisions, the FlaggeRdevs discussion started [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/General&amp;oldid=1215011#FlaggedRevs_Extension_Live_on_DE.WP here] was then turned in a [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/General&amp;oldid=1215011#Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs_Extension_discussion &quot;proposed configuration&quot;] that moved the discussion to the [[Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs Extension]] (notice that the adoption of the scheme was turned into the adoption of an acceptable configuration, the first was just assumed as consensual, that had an impact on the process) as I voted on the configuration in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs_Extension&amp;oldid=1216538 June 2008], it is clear that the full implications of the alteration were unknown and the comments of Whiteknight and Rob Horning clearly stated an understanding that the concept would be revisited and validated. Whiteknight the proponent of the idea already stated his wishes to have the scheme removed.
: So my view is that the needed proposal would be &quot;Should we keep using FlaggedRevs?&quot; and get a consensus on that if we can. Since the adoption of FlaggedRevs never got a discussion (as we all didn't know what was implicated when we agreed to the &quot;test&quot;).
: Since I don't see people agreeing to accept the needed reversal, we are left with a new attempt to reduce the impact it has on the project, in this convoluted way, without fixing what we supposedly are agreeing to (the proposal should be clearly stated and run in the [[Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs Extension]] page), that is the core of my objection for the rest my position is similar to Mike.lifeguard, with the added realization that we are doing it backwards to fix the never gathered consensus for keeping FlaggedRevs...

=== Anti-vandalism definition ===

Panic - I've gotten the impression (now and in the past) that you've been defining anti-vandalism to mean preventing it from happening in the first place.  Although I find that premise surprising, my suspicion that you're operating on that premise is supported by its excellent explanatory power for two of your positions:  (1)&amp;nbsp;You claim that flaggedrevs can't reduce vandalism unless it makes it more difficult to contribute, which would only make sense (regardless of whether one accepts the judgment implied about the effect) if one's definition of reducing vandalism excludes measures that aid in reliably repairing vandalism after the fact.  (2)&amp;nbsp;You claim that making the current draft visible by default would functionally remove flaggedrevs, which is only true if one postulates that the sole function of flaggedrevs is to, as you put it, make it more difficult to contribute.  I do agree that it functionally removes a basic reason (I'd thought, ''the'' basic reason) for your opposition to flaggedrevs.

:Only on Wikijunior would I endorse the operational objective of preventing vandalism from happening in the first place (where by &quot;happening&quot; I mean &quot;becoming visible by default&quot;).  Elsewhere, I consider our operational objective regarding vandalism to be reliably removing it after it happens.  That objective is served ''more'' effectively by flaggedrevs if the current draft is shown by default; for example, as I've remarked somewhere above in this absurdly long discussion (though there's something bemusing about a discussion where when you preview your comment you get a table of contents), I've stopped reviewing unreviewed pages in mainspace because I couldn't keep up with the burden of very-rapidly reviewing changes to every page I review &amp;mdash; so that showing the most recent reviewed version is an ''obstacle'' to the smooth functioning of flaggedrevs, rather than being necessary to it.

::Possibly, the difference of premise might also explain why you claim that we're not addressing the problems with flaggedrevs.  I'm not sure, though; there may be some other fundamental difference of premise behind that one.

:::This is the highest-profile and therefore best venue for this discussion.  It's very reasonable to put a notice of this discussion at [[Wikibooks talk:FlaggedRevs Extension]] (wish I'd thought of that; I'll do it next if no-one beats me to it [note: yup, you'd already done it]), despite the practical unlikelihood that anyone who would see the notice there isn't already aware of the discussion here.  Especially since anyone who has been following our gradual improvements to the flaggedrevs configuration over time is already aware that not all the consensus discussions take place there (which is why I added a list of pointers to consensus discussions to the page).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:11, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

::: Indeed anti-vandalism actions can be preventive or corrective. Since we work on a volunteering basis corrective practices are extremely costly (time and effort). Preventive actions have a better return but in the case of flaggedRevs I find the cost unacceptable as it makes participation difficult. Btw this is also the reason I've requested that the proposal is clearly formalized, there are simpler and rational steps that can prevent confusions, a better understanding among Wikibookians and a reference for historic background. If we don't preserve the historic memory we are bound to incur on the same mistakes.
::: As for the seemingly safe assumption you are making that any and whatever vandalism occurs is fixable at a later time. I can confidently state that the assumption is false, without entering in details (we shouldn't give anyone ideas), all edits are layered and any corruption of the content if not detected in a timely fashion will be, if not obvious, extremely difficult to recover from. If on that corrupted layered actions an administrator deletes the page then they are indeed impossible to recover from..
::: In regards to the reasons. I oppose the scheme mostly is the barrier it creates, next is that the scheme isn't designed to support our project needs (regrettable but factual). If we remove the first what other benefit do you see on the scheme, clearly the categorization of the pages will never work as we would like (hence my second motive to oppose it). What are the redeeming features that you see if we continue to use the scheme (with this last batch of changes) will benefit the project ?  
::: The why I make an effort to specify that we are doing it backwardly is simple, at this moment it is clear to all that there is not a consensual agreement to use the scheme now. This has a clear implication on the order we discuss the subject since the status quo is still the non adoption of the flaggedRevs (since the test has clearly failed and isn't fixable). So if people validated that the use of the tool permanently was never a consensual decision (fact) the burden would be in providing a reason and a solution that validates the time and effort put on keeping it alive. Failing that a resumption of the previous state would occur.
::: I've added a note on the talk of [[Wikibooks talk:FlaggedRevs Extension]] but this proposal is a change to what is the subject matter covered there as such that is the core of my standing objection to the alteration, I feel like others have now stated that some of the changes will have implications beyond what we are signing on for. This as you state is a simple thing to do but even I haven't the full understanding on what is now on the proposal (and technical know how) or I would do it myself as an unstable version of that page. If done and people continue to validate that text as the proposed changes, I will modify my vote to neutral and remove my block of the process.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:50, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

::: This proposal ''is'' clearly formalized.  It has the exact changes to be made to the code provided and a summary of each and every change.  I'll update the flagged revisions page when we get consensus on this and the changes are made to the configuration.  Removal of flagged revisions entirely is an extreme position.  Concessions have already been made to change the default view state of pages and to make it easier for people to become reviewers.  A lot of time has gone into reviewing pages already and there is concern about losing that, not time spent maintaining the system.  If you're looking through RC diffs for vandalism, it's not any more or less intensive than clicking the review link for changes.  Failure to spend the time reviewing pages or investing the time looking for vandalism won't make vandalism go away.  I would disagree that &quot;it's clear to all&quot; that there is not consensus, unless you somehow are counting neutral positions as opposition. Your position won't block the process; consensus doesn't require every last person to be on board. The layering of vandalism is something flagged revisions works well at preventing, in that it highlights ''all'' changes since the last review&amp;ndash;not just the last diff. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:26, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

I'm going to suggest, in hoping to reduce Panic's concerns about the edit filter, the removal of the possibility of creating filters that will result in a block or removal of administrator/bureaucrat groups. I'll reflect that change above.

=== Rollback and trust ===

On Mike's opinion for rollback with reviewer group, I'd like to point out the interesting tidbit that Wikipedia's use of flagged revisions believes that [[Wikipedia:Protection_policy#Pending-changes_protection_.28trial.29|&quot;reviewers are users with a similar level of trust to rollbackers&quot;]]. So it's not just Wikinews holding that position. As pointed out earlier, the alternative is submitting an old revision, which if done improperly will cause loss of data. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:25, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

:Adrignola, abusing rollback does not mean one is not trusted. One can be completely ignorant about the use of the rollback feature and use it for other purposes (eg people added redundant BookCats, which I just undid in RC!)

=== Difficulty of removing enabled extensions ===

The comment above &quot;Removal of flagged revisions entirely is an extreme position&quot; reminds me of something I meant to say but never got around to. (I do not disagree with statement)  At some point the claim was made that it was not possible to know how ReaderFeedback would work for us until we try it.  But the problem is that these changes gain momentum, even if they are not good. I find Mikes comment that &quot;I simply don't think the community is capable of supporting a robust reviewing scheme; we struggle just to create content.&quot; is spot on.  So Flagged Revisions in the main space has mostly created a new maintenance task to try to keep up with, but it is an extreme position to get rid of it because we are throwing away lots of hard work that has been done by all of us.  In the same way, we need to be very careful about applying that same &quot;we can just test it&quot; mentality that was apparently part of the IRC discussions about Flagged Revs to new extensions.   After we have had it hear for a while it will be difficult to through away feedback data that our readers and ourselves generated even if we recognize the tool is not working for us as it should be. More generally speaking it is simply a lot harder to take tools away then it is to add them. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 12:50, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

: Sure it can be hard to remove tools once they are enabled. On the other hand momentum over time has leaned more and more towards decreasing a dependency on FlaggedRevs. I think people took it upon themselves to create a new maintenance task out of FlaggedRevs. For whatever reasons, people wanted to be able to tell what revisions were previously checked, when they managed and were able to do without it before. Doing that is a convince that people took upon themselves to do and that is what created the new maintenance headache. I certainly didn't lean my support with that in mind and I think anyone else that supported it didn't make it clear they intended to use it in that way. In short I think how it is used makes the difference. I think someone mentioned before that Wikinews uses it for different reasons, and I've been inclined to believe the difference in use and not the configuration is the source of the problem. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:44, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

:: I am not sure it doesn't create a new maintenance task.  I have never liked FlaggedRev's and aside from a small number of pages, never flagged pages for the first time.  Nonetheless every time I log in and check my watchlist I have a bold orangish strongly worded message telling me I need to review pages with pending edits. I didn't seek this task out greets me every time I log in (I think it is the unique maintenance task that does this).  And occasionally because I get sick of looking at it I acquiesce and spend some time reviewing pages.  &lt;small&gt;When you say wikinews uses ''it'' I am not sure if your mean it to be FlaggedRevs or ReaderFeedback.  I'll Assuming you mean flagged revs since we are discussing its configuration more and your next comment was about configuration&lt;/small&gt; If your correct and it all comes down to a question of use, why are we using it in the Main name space?  I understand Wikijunior but that is the only place I clearly understand what we want to do.  But as I point out below, there is a bit of a conflict between the using it as a vandalism patrolling tool and the way we have been using it in the past.

:::I was not around during the time this extension was discussed, ''nor was it ever decided to properly document the motivations for enabling it''.  It was very bad form to discuss this on IRC entirely the first time, especially for a wiki configuration, with the wiki used only for collecting positions.  Panic mentions a historical record being desirable and I would agree.  I do use flagged revisions as a vandalism tool, ''at the most basic level''.  That means I do use the lowest level as vandalism-free and will not rate higher than that otherwise.  The notice on pending changes in orange is only if you are ''watching'' pages with revisions sighted, which assumes that you care about the content on that page.  If a book wants to use flagged revisions for stable versions of a certain quality, then they need to have an admin change the page settings to show the highest or second-highest review levels by default rather than any review level or the latest revision.  If people are against my use of it for vandalism patrol, informal or otherwise, then I'm going to revert to my position that it should be turned off in mainspace and stand with Mike on that point. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:17, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

:::: I thought more discussion should happen on wiki too, but didn't think it was going to happen, because of the lets see what happens nature of the situation. I think a few people that wanted it did have in mind to use it as a vandalism tool, but some people like me did not. I guess there wasn't really a consensus on how the tool was to be used which could also of been bad form and perhaps it shouldn't of been enabled for that reason. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:25, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

It sounds like we should along with our proposed changes make a propose rationale, which can later be turned into documentation.  This is what it sounds like what is being proposed about Flagged revs and the a little bit of what we are thinking as to why it should be this way.  '''Everyone please feel free to improve the rationale below, as someone who would hope to remove FlaggedRevs I probably am not the one to write this...'''  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:31, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

=== FlaggedRevs rationale ===
* FlaggedRevs will be our primary &lt;s&gt;vandalism patrol/prevention&lt;/s&gt; anti-vandalism tool.
* To encourage new editors, all edits will be visible from the moment they are made.  Except for pages particularly sensitive to vandalism (such as Wikijunior) which need to be configured separately (it will be pages at the &quot;good&quot;/&quot;average&quot; level that will be displayed).
* Reviewers will have all new pages they make sighted at the lowest level, since they are expected not to vandalize.  Of course this means reviewers who vandalize for what ever reason will likely have their tools removed, and will have to request they be given back as an RFP.
* We will have three levels at which modules may be rated.  The lowest level is intended to mean &quot;vandalism free&quot; but we may choose a friendlier term. The second, optional level, that a module may be flagged at will indicate this is a &quot;good&quot; module.  The final level, &quot;excellent&quot; only administrators will have access to grant.  This allows us, after configuring the page to show only this highest level, to almost lock sensitive pages but still allow unprivileged users to contribute to it, and when the changes are ready an administrator can approve it.  Thus we may have sensitive pages that everyone can contribute to.
* As a non-enforceable but documented bit of culture, Reviewers will be discouraged from reviewing modules in books at the &quot;good level&quot; if the book contributors do not want to take part in having their modules reviewed.  This may seem to beg the question why have a good level?  It could certainly be useful as a matter of internal review by the book contributors, or an external review such as in a request to have the book be Featured, etc.  This is a hangover from the current scheme, but one that I like, others may want to remove this bullet.
* Reviewers now have rollback permissions.  As our primary defense against vandalism it makes sense to allow them a tool which makes fighting vandalism easier.
* Everyone who contributes positively can help remove vandalism so we have made it easier in various ways to to become a reviewer.

On first reading, I pretty much like this.  I'm not clear if the non-enforceable-but-documented bit is meant to be opt-in or opt-out, though.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:55, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

:Yes, My idea was a book may opt out of FlaggedRev's '''except''' for the bottom vandalism free level.  Every page should be checked for vandalism. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:41, 2 July 2010 (UTC)
I don't like this. I think FlaggedRevs is not a vandalism, patrol, or prevention tool. Ratings are incrementally good, with each level rating above the previous being better, which is good for quality control and is what it was designed to do. If it was intended for vandalism, ratings would be incrementally worse instead, or it could mark pages as having been checked with a single click without a need for a form at all like was the case before FlaggedRevs was installed. People can still vandalize pages and the vandalism is still present in a page's history so it doesn't work as a prevention tool either. FlaggedRevs is good for showing revisions where everything on the page is grammatically correct, spelled correctly, and everything is well worded. The fact that revisions can also be shown that might have no vandalism on it is more of a side benefit than a functional use. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:23, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

Those who want new pages automatically reviewed likely use flagged revisions for vandalism patrol.  Those who don't likely use it for quality control.  Because flagged revisions removes page patrol, I've never been able to use that for anti-vandalism.  And with flagged revisions enabled in the main space, and no use allowed for &quot;vandalism-free&quot;, you've taken tools away from us in patrolling.  And 80% of the pages don't use it and so don't benefit from it. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:42, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

:I'd failed on first reading to properly register that word choice on the first bullet.  Even on wikijunior there is no actual prevention involved.  The use of the tool is different from what I understand to be the usual wiki sense of &quot;patrol&quot;.  So it's neither &quot;vandalism patrol&quot; nor &quot;vandalism prevention&quot;.  I've suggested &quot;anti-vandalism&quot;; note that that first bullet makes no claim that that's the only or even primary function of flaggedrevs, just that flaggedrevs is foremost among things that address that function.

:I disagree with the idea that anti-vandalism is a side benefit of flaggedrevs.  To my mind, it's the primary benefit of flaggedrevs; I'm confident of it, and not convinced that the higher ratings will be of much use by comparison (though I see no earthly reason not to give them a chance, and would be happy to see them work out well).  With vandalism-free as the minimal level of sighting, by whatever name, the anti-vandalism function is automatically present along with whatever other use there might be.  As long as the most recent sighted version is visible by default, though, neither the anti-vandalism nor any higher-rating use on mainspace can function properly, because that default creates a new and overwhelming maintenance task, rapidly reviewing all edits to previously sighted mainspace pages.  With the most recent version visible by default, reviewing becomes an incremental task over time, which wikis are good at, rather than a matter for urgent rapid action, which wikis are bad at.

:It seems to me that, since the rationale doesn't claim that either function (anti-vandalism or multi-level quality rating) is more important than the other, it should be possible for people who disagree about which is more important to nevertheless find a version of the rationale that they can all agree on.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 17:54, 2 July 2010 (UTC)
:::(Okay, rereading that I think I'm overstating slightly: one usually does a bit of fixing spelling and such at the same time that one certifies vandalism-free, which is in fact a good argument for not calling it &quot;vandalism-free&quot; (not that anyone is promoting that name since others have been suggested).  But I still consider that a side benefit of the minimal rating.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 18:56, 2 July 2010 (UTC))

:: Hmm... not sure if I know the usual sense of patrol.  Let me say, my thinking was all about the &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that appears in Recent changes and watchlists.  By marking pages with some vandalism free setting it will disappear and we can see which pages have been checked, thus helping us coordinate our efforts.  This is what I was thinking when I used patrol.  Prevention was clearly silly, though I have heard it claimed FlaggedRevs curbs vandalism by not allowing IP vandals to see the fruit of their work (not sure I believe it).

=== Highest review level ===
*I have one stipulation for giving support: We need to have a separate group who can mark pages as featured. That way the Admins won't have such a load. We can just call it &quot;Featurer&quot;, but it is necessary, so as to not tie up the admins with featured books. If anyone has a good reason for not having a separate group, I don't mind withdrawing this stipulation, it is just something I thought would be good. What do you think? [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 19:00, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

::One reason for not having a &quot;Featurer&quot; group is that it creates the two groups that are solely for reviewing pages and can create confusion.  We currently have editor and reviewer (with reviewer able to rate the highest level) and this proposal seeks to eliminate one of those two groups and just call it reviewer.  If changes are to be made such that reviewers will not have any limits on them in terms of what they can rate, then we only need two levels: one for the basic, vandalism-free version and one of higher quality that has actually undergone a content review. Otherwise there is no functional difference between the second and third levels if there is no restriction on who can rate to the highest level. However, there have been objections from yourself, Darklama, and Panic on that top level being restricted.  Eliminating the restriction would get your and Panic's support (I believe), but we may want to simplify things with two levels. A book is not going to be featured simply because all its pages are at featured quality in the review system, as it must still go through the nomination process. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:28, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

With the three levels being minimal, average, and good, minimal can mean that the revision was quickly scanned and appears to be free of any obvious vandalism by patrollers , average can mean that the revision has been proofread with grammatical and spelling errors fixed, and the revision is understandable/comprehensible by [[w:Wikipedia:WikiGnome|WikiGnomes]] and the like, and good can mean that the revision has been thoroughly exampled and determined that the structure makes since, the revision is accurate and cites its sources, and nothing else of importance is missing by someone that knows the subject. That is basically why I see no need to limit the highest level to administrators. When most or all pages in a book have a revision that is considered good than maybe people might consider nominating the book to be featured. Rather than using the level to indicate featured the level can be used to determine if a book might be ready to be featured. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:40, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

#&lt;strike&gt; {{oppose}}: Can't see the proposal working in practice.  Somebody else has already pointed out that WB struggles to get simply content let alone reviewing of such content.  Low levels of vandalism, sillyness and people adding misleading information don't warrant reviewing either.  The problem on Wikibooks is a lack of contributers and readers and not an excess of vandalism or dodgy information!&lt;/strike&gt; --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:10, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

#::It seems possible that Xania might have missed the key point that this proposal is a ''solution'' for the problems of flaggedrevs, by making the most recent draft visible by default instead of the most recent sighted version (except on Wikijunior).  So that sighting doesn't interfere with contributors, and reviewers aren't actively discouraged from sighting previously unsighted pages, and flaggedrevs is set free to be a bookkeeping tool that functions over time, rather than an administrative problem that demands rapid review of all edits to previously sighted pages.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 00:33, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

*::: I agree with Thenub314 in that respect, Xania is free to express his opinion as he sees fit, but since this is a discussion to gather consensus when one takes a position of objection he must provide a rational for a compromise or a reason for others to support his objection, if not he excludes itself from the process.
*::: In a process where ones view is a minority there are tree routes, establish that the minority view has grater value and gather support for it, attempt to reach a compromise at middle ground or concede to a change of vote to non-opposition. Political processes varies but all (even monarchies and dictatorships) involve some sort of negotiation, on our system stating that one is being pressed to chance his position is a copout, since in our setup no-one should have any power over the other. In fact it shows that others are willing to address your position, the alternative would be to ignore it or a permanent block on the discussion.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 14:14, 7 July 2010 (UTC)&lt;/strike&gt; 

(edit conflict) Nonsense! There is no '''must''' in a discussion like this.  And it is not a discussion to ''gather'' consensus, it is a proposal, gathering should not be part of the lingo, it goes towards the whole vote rigging feeling I expressed below.  Sometimes it is helpful to offer ideas for compromise, but it is not a requirement.  There is absolutely no need to concede, A single persons position will almost never blocks a proposal.  But mostly makes this comment nonsense is the part about '''excluding''' positions from considerations if they do not provide rationale.  Should we exclude the positions of support made by people who gave no reason and in now way took part in the conversation?  Shall I strike them through now? Or maybe there is some asymmetry between the support and oppose side of '''any''' proposition?  It makes me wish I were on the support side and allowed not to have a thought in my head.  At least none I would later be interrogated about.  

I would like to think that someone could choose to support or oppose based on arguments already given.  Which was how I read Xania's 
now removed position. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:59, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

''(discussion of Thenub314's ''oppose'' vote)''
::From you last comment above &quot;...my only concerns are about ReaderFeedback.&quot; and as I search references on those concerns I see only that you raise an issue about the reliability of the gathered information, is this correct ? --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 15:36, 6 July 2010 (UTC)

::: Perhaps I don't know what you mean about reliability... but that is not the word I would choose to describe my concerns.  I basically feel that ReaderFeedback will:
:::# disrupt the continuity of a book; 
:::# discourage new user edits by creating the impression that telling us what is wrong will lead to the being book fixed by us, instead of encouraging readers to be bold and fixing it themsleves; 
:::# not significantly help improve the books here as as most pages are do not have any active contributors.  
:::Though I don't feel these concerns really apply to the Cookbook.  

:::I haven't said so elsewhere, but probably we should choose different criteria should be chosen for Cookbook recipes, because at least I expect most readers to rate a recipe on its ease of preparation and taste regardless of what we call the criteria.   

:::As a compromise I suggested enabling the reader feedback forms on the talk namespaces for main and wikijunior instead of the spaces themselves.  Then make sure the reader feedback messages clearly states that actual page is being rated and not the discussion page.  Assuming this is possible.  (I ''still'' haven't RTFM).  But there is no particular support for this idea. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:17, 6 July 2010 (UTC)

:::PS I also thought that once turned on it would be difficult to turn off even if it doesn't work out for us.  Somehow this ended up under its own separate heading above which kind of destroyed the context of what the objection was about. But my comments in the  &quot;difficulty of removing an extension&quot; section were about the difficulty or removing ReaderFeedback once enable. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:21, 6 July 2010 (UTC)

:::: My reference to the &lt;u&gt;reliability of the gathered information&lt;/u&gt; referred to your statement «''I find Mikes comment that &quot;I simply don't think the community is capable of supporting a robust reviewing scheme; we struggle just to create content.&quot; is spot on''».  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:13, 6 July 2010 (UTC)

:::: Most of you concerns are valid but they are based on suppositions they can just as well have the reverse effect. In any case the way we do it now is no better so I see no great change, only that we will democratize the access to the classification.
:::: I would prefer not adopting the extension and keeping that classification the way it is to see the use of each work talkpage reinforced, as I don't see as a good structure to have a talk page for each page of a work, but accept that as a system limitation to us (it does the work well on Wikipedia), this option would also aggravate the issue of visibility. 
:::: Other alterations that could address the issue is by way of adding the right information on the interface box, ask users to fix issues could suffice.
:::: The third point you make seems contradictory, a book has contributors or has not (pages in themselves are a bit irrelevant), I don't work on pages I do work on books. I do maintain a watch in a multitude of pages and as a contributor I don't see the reader information as having that much of an impact, it may be useful, but not at the stages of development most books are. In my view, regarding that rating and even the other one, quality classification beyond '''average''', will only have a real use for and when someone decides to publish a Wikibook. Between now and then I expect that other alterations have addressed any negative consequences.
:::: The only solutions now seems not to adopt the extension (and keep the way we do that review, that has most of the same issues) or alter the extension in a way that addressees your objection. I would like that anyone on the know to see about what can be done to address the second possibility.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:48, 6 July 2010 (UTC)

:::::The reader feedback extension is for ''reader'' feedback, not editor or reviewer feedback.  It has no relation with the reviews assigned by flagged revisions. If it's bothersome, it can be hidden in per-user or per-book CSS.  Reader feedback classifications cannot be customized per namespace, at least in the current form of the extension.  This one remaining objection will not be able to be reconciled with revision 1873833 that everyone has now updated their support for, where reader feedback is enabled. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:44, 6 July 2010 (UTC)

::::::Just to be clear, with the acknowledgment that both schemes support concurrent classification regarding presentation. When you make a distinction on the providers of the feedback and state no relation, my understanding was that any editor or reviewer is also a ''reader'', even if not all reader at present can participate on the categorization the value or relation regarding the interpretation of the feedback is, we cannot say equal, but similar. Correct? Can't a request to participate in the improvement of content be added to the interface? (that would go more toward resolving Thenub314 concerns)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:21, 6 July 2010 (UTC)

:::::::Yes, reviewers are also readers, but that's getting into semantics.  The reason for the reader feedback is for those who ''are not'' reviewers to be able to assess pages in a way that doesn't serve as a vandalism or quality revision check. Feedback in the toolbox would be even worse than putting it on the talk page.  It will be overlooked, and even with our measly minimums for feedback, no pages would get the minimum required to produce meaningful numbers.  If one were seeking a way to marginalize the extension so badly that the next time it comes up it's removed, that would be the solution.  And under Vector, the toolbox is often hidden and so readers wouldn't even see the link for it in the toolbox.  That's not even considering the additional coding time that would be required to make it appear there, which would delay the start and the finish of this proposal's implementation by the developers.  Possibly a compromise to not risk interrupting the flow of pages while maintaining visibility would be to have it show up only on the root page of a book.  But the extension's not designed for that, as like most aspects of the software, it was designed with Wikipedia in mind first and foremost. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 23:31, 6 July 2010 (UTC)

:::::::: I don't see the relevancy on the distinction you make on who provides the feedback or how we can guaranteer the value of that information. I see it as an helping tool for prioritization not as exact indicator on what is lacking. I suppose vandals will also provide their own feedback, so the power of the extension is in the averaging out of the information we get from all Wikibookians (without any particular distinction). If you disagree and because the interpretation of the data isn't been defined on the proposal, lets move this point to your or mine talk page as it has no relevance to the current objection. 
:::::::: I didn't say &quot;feedback&quot; I said if it is possible to include a statement in the interface to indicate that we value more active contributions than participation in the rating system (not in so many words). This seems to be the core objection of Thenub314 that users will see it as the optimal way to contribute to improve the project in place of adding/contributing to the content.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:49, 6 July 2010 (UTC)

::::Thenub314, will it satisfy you the possibility to hide the extension as Adrignola indicates?  We could also try to get more Wikibookians to take a position on the proposal, would you concede to change your position to non-objection, if more people express their support for the proposal ? Do you have any viable proposal to resolve the impasse ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:21, 6 July 2010 (UTC)

::::: Adrignola's suggestion about using CSS to turn it off in particular cases is a good idea.  Unfortunately my concerns mostly stem from the fact that I feel enabling this extension is a bad move for the project, and not so much from concerns about the books I work on.  I don't understand why the number of people expressing their support should effect my opposition.  The whole point of a consensus is that we don't have to all agree.  I am unfortunately out of ideas for a way to improve ReaderFeedback, it is a shame it can't be configured per namespace, but that is life.

::::: Overall I would like to point out that something is going awry in the conversation.  I think the atmosphere unintentionally... I am not sure of the right word.  But there is a lot of politics going on to get people to change their positions, and it doesn't sit entirely well with me.  Are '''four''' editors really necessary to jump on 3AНИA's hasn't read and understand what is going on?  That is just... toxic.  If I were him I would really be fuming.  And what is so unreasonable about his position?  He doesn't see this working out for us because we have too few editors, it wasn't unreasonable when Mike made the same suggestion.  If he doesn't like the tool being about why should he support some reconfiguration of it?  Even neutral comments are now drawing discussion along the lines of &quot;Perhaps you didn't understand.&quot;  I always thought going around to talk pages and trying to get people to change their positions was considered bad form.  But a lot of that seems to be going on.  

::::: So could we keep comments about this thread in this thread? (Including the &quot;please clarify your position&quot; comments on talk pages?)  It splits up the conversation Really, how should we interpret [[User_talk:I-20#Can you please clarify you position|I-20's response]]?  Is that intended to be part of this conversation?  I have no idea.  It would also keep two editors from expressing their confusion over 3AНИA vote here along with two at his talk page, which seemed to be sort of a double whammy to me. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:47, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

::::: As a PS, I do think Mike's comment is spot on, but I think you may have misunderstood that comment, it has nothing to do with the reliability of gathered information. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:47, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

::::::'''This isn't a vote!''' These are position summaries. This is the equivalent to a debate in a political arena and an attempt to try to satisfy the most people and address the most concerns possible.  When someone opposes a proposal, naturally a desire is there to see if the concerns can be addressed.  But if the concerns are not outlined properly, that makes it difficult to address them.  Thus people ask for clarification, ''not a change in position''.  If people hold so little value in their position that they aren't prepared to defend it or justify it, then so be it.  This proposal's pretty much done and I'll file a bug report later today. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:13, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

::::::: Look I didn't mean to offend anyone.  Adrignola, as far as your comment goes you clearly asked for a clarification.  And no one understands this isn't a vote better than I do, but the word was being used at Xania's talk page when he was asked to reconsider and I suppose I let it slip.  But let me be clear that '''I was explicitly asked to change my position'''.  At Xania's talk page he was told to '''&quot;please change either your vote or your reason&quot;''', and told he probably didn't understand what the changes were about.  (And he is understandably annoyed).  FWIW, I don't think Xania does not value his position so little, it is simply that all the defense and rebutle etc that lead to his position is already accounted for in this conversation. No need to lenghten it, and he was a bit annoyed at the forceful response to his &quot;vote&quot;.

::::::: More subltly going around to talk pages and asking '''only one side''' to update their support for a particular revision is also a subtle '''rigging fo the process'''.  Just as you say that if someone doesn't care enough to defend their postion then so be it.  If someone cares so little as to not pay attention to the changes should we be considering their point of view as part of the consensus.  Perhaps they just updated it with a  &quot;yeah sure, whatever&quot; attitude.  This kind of behavior ruins the whole process.  I don't say that as a way to try to block this change, but just to say that IMO '''something very bad happend here'''.  Maybe something woth talking about later. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 13:01, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

{{outdent|:::::::}}That's pretty harsh for a proposal that is of this length and went through so many revisions since initially being put forth.  I don't blame people for wanting to conduct discussion off the beaten path and out of the limelight or inform others of easy-to-overlook changes that were made to address key concerns of theirs. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:32, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

:Maybe it is harsh.  I thought it was all a bit innocent at first.  But put yourself in my shoes.  I became the unique person to have a section title after him (two if you count this one).  I was asked to restate my opinions and then told all my opinions subjective and could easily go the other way (how does ReaderFeedback improve continuity?). Then pressured into changing my position. It is a bit hard not to feel singled out.  Then when two new people state opinions that are not favorable toward flagged revs, they draw comments suggesting they do not understand, they are being self contradictory, etc etc.  Xania was effectively bullied, not on purpose granted, but our collective reaction was quite harsh towards him.  They were bad mistakes made in good faith.  And people did only go around talk pages seeking support for one side.  It is easy for me to empathize with Xania's comment that &quot;I refuse to be pressurized by a small minority who seem to think that they're in charge.&quot; I am not sure about the small minority part, but as I said before, something bad has happened here.  After today, to me this whole conversation smells like three day old fish.  

:It is clear that the changes will pass despite my objections and I am fine with that.  My point is we really should aim to do better.  With changes this major we should be trying doubly hard to make sure our process is beyond reproach, and we have not achieved that. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:08, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

::ReaderFeedback improve continuity by providing the contributors the information about more silent readers, not all readers will become active contributors but it is admissible that a fraction of the now nonparticipating users will interact with the extension, this provides editors clues on what parts of Wikibooks (in general) or project are of more interest to the community and work on them.

How can we read this and know if other people didn't add their view of oppose because they weren't up to the fight?  How many people have we scared away from expressing their opinion?  I suspect none or not many, but who knows.  In the end I don't blame him for feeling like he was continuing to be harassed.

:::::: I do believe that most Wikibookians actively avoid participating in discussions, I did so actively, for most of my first years here.  This is why we should extend protection to fringe views and opinions. Regarding Xania be assured that he is well capable of speaking for himself. I read his position a bit differently than you, his observation, disregarding his frustration with the time we take debating things, was in line with what Mike's states bellow, but that position can't be acted upon, the level of consensus for the alteration is greater than for the removal of FlaggedRev. That is why I changed my position and probably part of the reason Mike didn't made it the subject of an opposition.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 15:57, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

#I have no opinion as yet on the proposal. I have no opinion about the part where new pages are automatically marked as patrolled. That seems to run against the current FlaggedRevs philosophy, though in a sense it makes life easier. I am also skeptical about assigning the editor rights with the rollback right. I am worried that an editor may not read our policy on rollbacks and misuse it because they have been autopromoted to editor but know little about it.

The only way that it could be opt-in in any way would be if you're thinking of possible requests to an admin to make pages show the most recent reviewed revision by default. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:36, 2 July 2010 (UTC)
#::: When darklama had said earlier that &quot;FlaggedRevs was suppose to be opt-in for each book after the last time we made changes, and I think we need to do a better job of that being the case by discouraging people from sighting revisions in a book unless they want both the benefits and hassles that come with using FlaggedRevs.&quot; I took this informal opt-in as what was supposed to be the status quo left over from last time.  Sure there is no way to stop a reviewer from flagging any page he or she likes.  It is a shame it can't be turned on/off book by book but it is a limitation of the software.  But if our current aim is to allow editors/reviewers to opt-in particular books, it makes sense to interpret the word as it has been used before.  As an informal (and sadly undocumented) idea that reviewers should not flag modules of books that the people working on them do not want flagged.  One of the reasons I wanted to be clear about whether or not we intend to use Flagged Revs as a vandalism tool is because it does runs into conflict with this idea.  Which is why I am very confused as to what we are trying to accomplish in the Main namespace. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 13:57, 2 July 2010 (UTC)
#:::: I think there was some unstated assumptions and probably a lot of that going around throughout the whole life in which FlaggedRevs has been used. I believe last time it was learned that reviews could be undone/cleared and so simply clearing all reviews from books that didn't want it combined with disabling autoreview would be enough to make FlaggedRevs opt-in since with no reviewed revisions the current revision would be shown. That didn't work because people continued to review revisions anyways. If it had worked there would of been no need to ask administrators to change the stability setting, since it didn't the next step seems obvious to have stability setting off by default and that is exactly what was proposed. I just think it would of been better if people would of stopped reviewing all revisions because than administrators wouldn't need to do more work and people wouldn't need to seek an administrators to opt into it. Not requiring administrative action is more ideal, but seems like it might be unrealistic now, especially with people still wanting to use it as vandalism tool. Wanting to use it as vandalism tool combined with wanting to turn it off seems rather contradictory to me, which always brings me back to the idea that how people use it and what its used for should be what changes. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:39, 2 July 2010 (UTC)
# After reading through the proposal for the first time, I think it's better than what we have now (especially considering, as others have mentioned, the difficulty we have generating content), but it would be better to just get rid of it. I haven't been here for a while, so a question for all of you: does it happen often that someone makes an edit to a reviewed page (even a good one) and it just sits there because no one has watched it and &quot;accepted&quot; the revision?

#: The discussion is way too long to read through, IMO anyway, so here's the key point as I see it:  Once the most recent draft is visible by default, rather than the most recently sighted one, flaggedrevs not only loses its downsides, it is enabled to serve a potentially valuable function that it's now being prevented from freely serving.  The problem isn't that pages wait a long time to be sighted (they do; see [[Special:OldReviewedPages]]), the problem is that it ''matters'' that they wait a long time like that, because the most recent sighted version is visible by default.  With the most recent draft visible instead, flaggedrevs becomes a bookkeeping device for keeping track, ''over the long term'', of what has and has not been vetted.  Wikis are good at doing things gradually, which is what flaggedrevs aids under the proposal; wikis aren't so good at rapid customized response to unique actions across a broad front, which is the sort of administrative mess that flaggedrevs tends to create in mainspace now (without the proposal).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 02:36, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

== Proposal to change the icon and definition of &quot;tranwiki&quot; at the RfDs ==

Proposal and changes to it are now open and will end after 7 days of inactivity, there is &lt;u&gt;no need to express support&lt;/u&gt;, please add comments or propose changes.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 09:06, 16 July 2010 (UTC)


For some time I have felt that Wikibookians don't fully appreciate the implications behind a transwiki in the context of a RfD and those that understand the meaning of transwiki don't understand the benefits behind the closing of a discussion as transwiki.&lt;br&gt;
In general terms a transwiki is a request for an administrator to perform a copy (not a move), in the context of a RfD it also implies a deletion, but the action is in fact a request for ''content push'' from us to another community. I don't know but expect that some of these unrequested copies of content are simply deleted at destination (if you have any knowledge about that it would be interesting to know).&lt;br&gt;
The proposal is to change the icon now labeled as traswiki to state &quot;savable&quot; (prevent waste or loss of, to conserve), that clearly indicates that the position taken on the RfD is that at the present time the content has no place in the project, but has intrinsic value and we recognize the effort put in providing it, as Pi zero said on a RfD, that the content is &quot;not trash&quot;, this of course doesn't remove the possibility of indicating a transwiki location to save the work, but puts emphasis on our classification of the content not on how it will be disposed of.&lt;br&gt;
The other related change, I propose, is that that if a clear location for a transwiki is established and it is the outcome selected that the content should be pulled, this requires that the community we defined as a destination should be notified and accept the content, we can establish a procedure as we discuss the proposal.&lt;br&gt;
This proposal is now open and will end after 7 days of inactivity, there is &lt;u&gt;no need to express support&lt;/u&gt;, please add comments, express your opposition or propose changes.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:07, 14 July 2010 (UTC)
: I think having a better relationship with other websites where works are suggested to be copied to is a good idea. In the past people from StrategyWiki have posted a comment on the RfD discussion when they have adopted a work. I think the current name &quot;transwiki&quot; and icon is good enough. A person's opinion of what to do with the work can be influenced by whether or not a website is willing to take the work. Some people might be willing to support copying to another website because at least it would have a home, but might want to keep the work otherwise. Some people say &quot;transwiki or delete&quot; which can be useful for understanding what people would like to see done with the work if target website is not interested in the work for example. I think it would be nice when a consensus is reached to transwiki that the consensus be noted on RfD, but the discussion is left open until we hear back from the website where the work is to be copied to, so if the website doesn't want it the community can decide what it wants to do instead. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:25, 14 July 2010 (UTC)

:: I also understand the more experienced Wikibookians don't see this as a great issue, but since the RfDs are in my experience now the primary location that new Wikibookians select to participate in the political process of the project some extra attention to details and for clarity should be taken. 
:: On the idea of the &quot;transwiki or delete&quot; not all content of value will have a destination, not all will be accepted, that doesn't reduce the future usefulness on it. Closing every deletion of such content in a distinct manner permits to in the future for Wikibookians to easily identify content that at present wasn't seen as fit for a keep (here and elsewhere) and an easier way to separated it from empty stubs and other &quot;trash&quot;.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:38, 14 July 2010 (UTC)

::I've attempted to make clear that this wasn't a vote/poll, before everyone starts to take sides,&lt;s&gt;I would request that you let your opposition stay but remove the icon as it has a connotation linked to the normal straw poll we perform.&lt;/s&gt; I was attempting to avoid that at this early stage...&lt;s&gt;
::I don't understand what you are opposing. In fact what you describe as &quot;slippery slope&quot; is what normally happens, that is why I proposed the second modification. From a push to a pull.
::You don't seem to be disagreeing that the normal position of transwiki relates to the value of the content under discussion,&lt;/s&gt; the renaming of the icon (that is misleading since a transwiki is a request for a copy) and I've made clear that the new label, that can be anything (I just found that &quot;savable&quot; was well suited to indicate the position), will continue to signify a possible transwiki but also situation that a destination project can't be found or doesn't accept the content. We must remember that we are in a volunteering basis actions are not obligations, this also raises the bar to make people examine the contributions of others beyond [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?]] (even if some of us already do that). This would mean that any OR (if it has actual content would be tagged differently than an empty stub or gibberish. This would reduce the feeling that some Wikibookians get of alienation and frustration after a deletion of their work.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:59, 14 July 2010 (UTC)

:::: &lt;s&gt;I'm glad that you see that you are objecting to what normally happens when someone opts for the position of transwiki.&lt;/s&gt;
:::: When in a RfD, I select to argue for a traswiki, I'm recognizing that the work proposed for deletion has an intrinsic value that while not useful in Wikibooks will be useful elsewhere, I'm making a position about the value of the content I don't know how you can separate the two. Since a traswiki position has no impact on the destination community, we are in fact evaluating the content.
:::: In any case what normally happens isn't on the proposal, &lt;s&gt;so I'll ask you to clarify any objection to&lt;/s&gt; what is proposed, a simple renaming of the position of transwiki that will clarify the situation where it is refused at destination or the content can't be accommodated elsewhere, and an alteration from the practice of &quot;push&quot; to a &quot;pull&quot; from the other community. &lt;s&gt;Do you have objections to these issues ?&lt;/s&gt;  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:46, 14 July 2010 (UTC)

:I am opposed to this proposal. Panic here seems to be a [[meta:Association of Transwikist Wikipedians|transwikist]]. Anyhow, I don't like the idea of calling transwiki 'save', then decide on which community we shove it to. I believe that WV is currently a place to dump random scraps of educational material, but that's unrelated. I don't think that we should use transwiki as an excuse for saving material that may be considered good but is useless for the community. Nowadays you don't see people commenting, 'transwiki to so-and-so' at WP XfDs. What I believe is, transwiki should only happen when the work a) is not nonsense (and the book contributors can help us understand that; b) be are absolutely sure that it fits in the scope of another wiki and c) there is someone to do the transwiki. In case of copy-and-paste transwiki to a wiki which does not allow transwiki from WB, such as Wikia, then not only do we need to find an appropriate place in a strange wiki, but we also have to make sure that the contributors there want it and then care about the attribution etc. IMO, such transwikis should only be done if the book contributor(s) want it.

::Again, in general you are expressing opposition to something that is the common practice, as did Thenub314, even that it should be clear that the second part of my proposal addresses that issue, the custom dumping of content will stop.  
::In what regards an argument against this proposal, you state that you object to 'save', in fact I avoided that word intentionally and opted by a derived one '[http://www.tfd.com/savable savable]' that qualifies the content not the action, I'm attempting to make it clearer the position taken on the RfD, how it will be closed is still open, and 'transwiki' will probably continue to apply especially if some consensus is gathered for the change advance by Darklama to request a state of hold on the RfD until the transwiki is completed. (There are alternative solutions and problems with this method but lets leave it as is for now and address what was tabled first, we will come back to it later)
::I'm not stuck on the 'savable' term, if you have a better one put it forward, the intention is to clarify that the old transwiki and the icon we normally use are not fit for the function that we normally use it. We don't need a consensus to alter or adopt a new icon, anyone can state the position as they like I'm only attempting to establish a best practice and mutual understanding to enable a cleaner running of the discussions. If we agree fine if not I've made my point and will start using the term myself now that I've explained why, but the usefulness will be diminished and contribute to increase the confusion, just the opposite of what the icons were meant to do.   
::More experienced Wiibookians can understand the nuances of the transwiki position and what it implies on the context of an RfD, but most newcomers, even from sister projects don't, in that regard the link you provided has no bearing on this project and how we use transwikis. I can't seem to grasp what you intended by pointing out [[meta:Association of Transwikist Wikipedians|transwikist]], can you attempt to explain it in another way ?
::I take the chance to make clear to you is that what you believe and aspire to and what happens seems to diverge (and with a great difference of latitude), when you say &quot;''I don't think that we should use transwiki as an excuse for saving material that may be considered good but is useless for the community''&quot;, that is just what we normally do, it is not for us to decide what another community sees as useless we only &quot;have power&quot; about what is on this project, and there is no other way to do it unless as I propose we reverse the practice of transwiki so that you aspiration about point c) is realized.
::Another point is that as you state when participating in a RfD we are not only validating content for Wikibooks but also examining the value of the work, a requirement for your points a) b), this effort that we make when participating on a RfD if extended a little bit further can help on archival to indicate to future Wikibookians or even outside communities that some works do have some other intrinsic value. This is not only helpful for us but for the contributor that took the time to commit the work to us and in the future it can serve to rescue some works if and when the views of our or other community changes, it is clear to anyone participating on the RfDs that the outcome are often inconsistent and extremely dependent on the ones participating on the process. It is my strong belief that this is not only beneficial to us but that we owe this consideration to the volunteers that do provide us the content.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:02, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

::::&lt;s&gt;You lost me on &quot;you and I have different perceptions about what is normally happening&quot;, since we are both participating on the RfDs what is happening is clearly stated on the argumentations we normally use there, so I find it strange that you never noticed my position on the subject before but seem invested in refuting it here.
::::But clearly you are missing things that do happen on the RfDs, when you say &quot;''Further I would not want the vote to have any connotation the the content is or is not trash.''&quot;, this already happens (need examples?) and when you say &quot;''My point stands that the vote to transwiki (or what ever you wish to call it) does not, and should not, imply an endorsement of quality by the editors here.''&quot;, this also happens today, you can clearly go now to the RfD and see a proposal about OR that has a majority position for deletion, we all know OR place is Wikiversity, can you state that an evaluation of the content isn't performed ?
::::Even your argument &quot;''There are many modules beyond any individuals level of expertise in many fields, and at some level our ability to discern meaningful content from nonsense breaks down.''&quot;, that clearly is valid, but collapses as a base of opposition because you are not obligated to participate in every RfD. I do excuse myself on these grounds from participation today.
::::So can you clarify what you mean in your vote for a transwiki that is different from what I do. (I don't believe you do anything different, we seem just take different conclusions from it)
::::All Wikibookians are volunteers it is not up to you to impose a requirement on any Wikibookians, I was politely excluding myself from that particular game that wasn't leading to what I requested in the first place, a request that devolves in an imposition is completely different from a commonly accepted practice where we have Wikibookians dedicated in facilitating those action and even if you don't have accounts others do or will volunteer to provide the service if the community sees a benefit in it, and at least one of the persons that has done transwikis to Wikiversity sees a benefit in having a closer relation with other communities in this respect, in any case the burden will be reduced as it will remove unproductive actions and has the chance of bringing new people to the project. Me requesting a transwiki to Wikiversity without being active in that community would be as false as pushing it in the first place.
::::I don't recall in what context I labeled you a deletionist, a deletionist to me is someone that deletes or promotes the deletion of more content than he creates or promotes to create, this without any direct good or bad connotations, mostly based on the position taken on RfDs, content contributions, merges, etc, not counting administrative deletions.  As a matter of curiosity I did a check on the present RfD page and still see an inclination for delete support, this is all very unscientific, but could also be related to why you have difficulty attributing levels of quality to the works.&lt;/s&gt;  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 15:25, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

=== Reshuffle 1 ===
As could have been expected by some and it is now clear, Wikibookians aren't basing their stance on RfDs discussions on the same sets of requirements. This reinforces the understanding that arguments behind the positions is what really counts on those discussion, sadly enough we often use the simple count of the positions, not the value of the arguments used and this of course has implication on how the discussions are closed.&lt;br&gt;
One of the reasons why I advanced the idea of a simple rename was to clarify and aggregate similar positions around the value of the content. But one must realize that the use of the position indicator icon seems to make things that already start by promoting a deletion worse and invite the felling of a &quot;vote&quot;, with supporting &quot;votes&quot; often reinforcing the acceptance of the request and reducing the chance of anyone putting forward a challenge to the final deletion.&lt;br&gt;
Taking in account the increased (and recently even if partly as a joke) expression of dislike for votes the RfD still suffers from being seen as a vote (even the rename hasn't helped changing things much), should we drop the icon completely and restructure the formalization of a RfD as a request for Wikibookias to state opposition to it and for instance add time-out for holding for the participation of the work's editor/community, to be given a chance to be the first reply to the request. In a similar way to what we do for example for some of the system flags.&lt;br&gt;
This of course without disregarding what was already said and not discarding the beneficial changes that can be made to he transwiki decision.&lt;br&gt;
Does any one oppose dropping the use of the icons and restructuring the RfD around a request for opposition and comments ?  Or a better idea to avoid the use of icons that permits seemingly equal, but different positions, as to valued to be &lt;u&gt;counted&lt;/u&gt; together.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:06, 16 July 2010 (UTC)

:I think we're all clear that voting is evil, and that RFDs aren't votes.  I don't think there's any [[wikt:if it ain't broke, don't fix it|problem]] with RFD, except perhaps the subtle and linguistically challenging difficulty that because &quot;vote&quot; is such a short and common word, it's easy to fall carelessly into the shorthand of calling the declarations of position in such discussions &quot;votes&quot;.  I'll be amazed if I hadn't slipped up that way myself from time to time.  The only thing I think we might do to improve the RFD process is to find another short common word to use instead of &quot;vote&quot; (clearly the word &quot;vote&quot; gets no serious competition from &quot;declaration of position&quot;), and then find ways to embed that different word in our idioms and habits.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:18, 16 July 2010 (UTC)

::I do think that, well I won't call it broken, but it has problems and it can be improved. The topmost one is that people working on the projects are rarely present in the discussions, and in the instances that they are, few cases end in a satisfactory way so that the &quot;responsible&quot; Wikibookian understand why the work has been deleted, that we recognize the effort made. Mostly by the RfD action we alienate people from the project.
::The process also is unbalance regarding re-evaluations, a process that is keep can be continuously evaluated until someone manages to pass a deletion, undeletion request only occur shortly after the deletion, probably because they lose completely any visibility and are relegated to the archives without any special distinction. RfDs are in general unfavorable to abandoned works.
::On the issue of transwikis we already seen that some of the closes as transwiki are null actions, and minority views on a transwiki aren't considered even if they in what relates to us are equal to deletions (on the context of RfDs), and the fulfillment of the closing verdict isn't guaranteeable.
::Most of the RfD are direct and clear, the only issue arises is when the work under RfD isn't clearly rejected by the WB:WIW (mostly because of OR considerations) or has other intrinsic value incompatible with Wikibooks.
::It is also clear that there has been inconsistencies and confusion on the closing RfD discussions, that in cleanup spreed a deletionist frenzy is created and that band-wagoning occurs. Supporting votes are unnecessary most of the times and the request intention is not always clear (if really promoting a deletion or merely asking).
::Another point is that we are losings relevant work, even if evaluation of the works under RfD is only assumed (there is no way to know how informed anyone is before he takes a position, unless he makes an argument in support of that possible), I always presumed (and it seems I was wrong) that when analyzing works people did it in broader terms, even if not in compliance with our project, in most cases people attempted to make a judgment regarding a works worth. I for once have always expressed what I found good about any type of work on my comments and posterity is losing a chance to easily benefit from this quality analysis that would at least help at a later time find a new life to the free content that was provided to us.
::The final item is that the icons we use to distinguish positions, do serve to do head counts, that are indeed votes and numbers do in fact shape the outcome and as seen in the parent thread not all icons mean the same to all, so I do think we can do better.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:26, 16 July 2010 (UTC)

After surveying the discussion, I feel the second part of Panic's original proposal (making it mandatory to notify the receiving end of a transwiki) is really important. There is no need, however, for it to be accompanied by changes of terminology, abolishment of voting icons and similar changes to the RfD process. At the end of the day, no amounts of linguistic sugarcoating will completely quench the (instinctive?) urge of editors to attempt vote-counting or to join groupthink. The only effective way to tackle that is developing a suitable culture among contributors, and from my brief experience here I think our progress in that direction has been quite decent in fact. Finally, I should add that I find rather unsettling the idea that Panic, as I understood it, appears to outline on the &quot;losing relevant work&quot; paragraph above, namely that our collective inability to judge the Worth of a book should be an argument for inclusionism. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 01:34, 17 July 2010 (UTC)

:The change of terminology is not a change in regards of function but clarification about the aggregation of similar judgments. When someone puts a &quot;stance&quot; for transwiki (with the icon) most of the time they have done an assessment of the content in relation to at least the target of the proposed transwiki (some do more than that), it is important to safeguard that assessment work as a different tag on closing the discussion, it is important to make clear that even minority views on transwiki should be taken in account. It must be made clear that transwikis are not guaranteed and not all content determined as unfit for Wikibooks is equal or transwikable.
:So yes we have a problem about preserving the work that is done on RfDs, and a responsibility in protecting all contributed freed content (deletion is not an irreversible process), even if we haven't a use for it now, it is important to get this translated on the way we archive the discussion.

It is should be clear to all that with open collaboration comes unknown consistency, there is no way around that, unless standard are elevated and participation  made hard, if that is promoting &quot;inclusionism&quot; then yes I think we should or at least more than we are now, kept works can always be improved. (Keep in mind that the project is funded by donation) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:19, 17 July 2010 (UTC)

::While I do think we should not stifle contribution by imposing overzealous standards and give due weight to the potential of a book when ruling on its destiny, once we start thinking too much about &quot;analysing in broader terms&quot; or &quot;posterity&quot; we can become too scared to draw a line and stand for project scope. For kept works are not only improved on but developed towards some goal, and despite our limited capabilities as volunteers we are supposed to judge whether that goal fits with the bigger picture of Wikibooks. In other words, the main issue would be to which extent we are (morally?) responsible for  &quot;protecting all contributed freed content&quot; beyond the educational resources we intend Wikibooks to be made of. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 03:53, 17 July 2010 (UTC)

:::Ok so we seem to be in accord that raising the standards isn't something we want at least for now with the level of participation we have (I never proposed that in relation to this discussion, I said it is the only way to guarantee consistency). If you look on the RfD most of them are easy decisions. What we have trouble dealing is with the works that fall in the gay area of what is acceptable by WB:WIW, we rarely have people working intentionally outside of the scope of the project. I think small changes in the formalism can serve to reduce alienating contributors and improve the situation without doing any damage. How much we change is open to debate, I started only proposing a rename of the &quot;transwiki&quot; icon to &quot;savable&quot; but after the first round of discussion it seems that the icons itself and how they influence RfD closing to count position and not the power of arguments should be considered.
:::We are morally responsible to the degree we can and are willing to be, in fact, as I said, all the deleted content remains on the system, we could attempt to improve the RfDs to serve as an indication about what is deleted, for instance with special categories that can be used as we archive the discussions, without any special work on our part. Even failed transwikis could be reassessed later by the project that refused them, standards are always in flux, consider for instance the possibility that we decided to cover again video games manuals, working on our archived discussions would be a daunting task.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:19, 17 July 2010 (UTC)

Just a reminder about this proposal discussion. Does anyone object to stop using the the &quot;stance&quot; icons and to the requirement that every RfD that promotes a transwiki be closed stating that the work request for transwiki was acceptance by the destination community (or not) or if no destination is no found for &quot;savable&quot; content (not an empty stub or trash, that it has some other intrinsic value) that the the closing statement indicates it as it is deleted ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:26, 23 July 2010 (UTC)

:This discussion was too long and convoluted for me to follow, but I plan to continue to use stance icons.  To me if a discussion ends on a transwiki, if it's not accepted at the destination, then it's deleted here as it's been indicated to be out of scope. As for an alternative to vote, the standard at Wikipedia is to use !vote. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:56, 23 July 2010 (UTC)

: I disagree with your assessment that people often just count positions, though I do think more people should include a rationale or explanation of why a discussion was closed. I think &quot;keep&quot; or &quot;delete&quot; alone is not a rationale or explanation of why a discussion was closed, in the same way as saying &quot;keep&quot; or &quot;delete&quot; within a discussion without an explanation as to why, is reason enough to disregard that comment.
: &quot;stance&quot; icons are a convenience that people decided to use on their own without prompting or requirement that they be used. I believe there should continue to be no requirements one way or another to their use. I believe anyone that agrees will stop using them, and anyone that objects will continue to use them.
: I disagree with closing a tranwiki discussion until the target destination has been informed and has had reasonable amount of time to decide whether it wants the work or not, unless people in the discussion have clearly indicated that they support deletion if the target destination is unwilling to take it. I wouldn't object to asking people to clarify what they think should be done with the work if the target destination doesn't want it, so that people don't need to be asked later should the target destination not want it and discussion doesn't need to remain open. Asking people questions on what you don't understand is probably the ideal outcome. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:04, 23 July 2010 (UTC)

== Editor threshold ==

I've heard that WikiJunior edits don't count toward the 100 edits needed to not be reviewed.  I think that WikiJunior book edits should count toward the 100.  That's the proposal. [[User:Purplebackpack89|Purplebackpack89]] ([[User talk:Purplebackpack89|talk]]) 03:40, 24 July 2010 (UTC)

:This change is already in the works, along with a large package of other configuration changes that include somewhat reducing a couple of the other criteria for autopromotion.  Having achieved consensus, we submitted a bugzilla request for the reconfiguration.  How long it will take before the changes are made remains to be seen.  It's a big change, and there was recently some confusion over the proof of consensus &amp;mdash; due, it appears, to the humongous size of the discussion that led to consensus.  As of this writing that discussion is still visible above on this page, at {{nowrap|[[#Reconfigure Wikibooks]]}}; in fact, it's larger than everything else now on this page put together.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 06:55, 24 July 2010 (UTC)

== Autoconfirmation ==

(Oh, well. There are lots of long discussions going on. I guess there's no crime in starting another.) So, anyway, I'm not a big fan of the current autoconfirmation system. I know a lot of people will disagree with me, but IMHO, the current autoconfirmation system is close to useless. I don't understand why someone's account only has to be four days old to get to edit semiprotected pages, move pages etc. It's quite pointless isn't it? If someone wants to do page move vandalism or vandalise semiprotected pages, they just need to wait 4D. Or, maybe someone created an account months ago and decided to come round and vandalise when he was bored. I propose either tightening the autoconfirmation criterion, or getting rid of it once and for all. A good example would be the English WP, where your account must be a few days old AND have made ten edits. We don't have to be as mean as the Chinese WP (50 edits), not even like English WP. Maybe make a new account make five edits before it can get autoconfirmed. That way, if he's a vandal by the time he can edit semiprotected pages or do page move vandalism, he's blocked.

: I thought about bringing that up when we did the reconfiguration before, but I didn't want to risk compromising the potential for the proposal to pass.  I wasn't quite sure there would be support for it.  Adding an edit requirement and even going as far as Wikipedia in not allowing unregistered users to create new pages would probably stop some vandalism.  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:12, 19 July 2010 (UTC)

::I oppose to not allowing unregistered users to create new pages. According to my experience, page creation vandalism is much more frequent in WB than WP.

:::::It's not a strong position, but if anything, I would expect them to be unfamiliar with Wikibooks conventions such as the naming policy and the scope of the project and would want them to work with some existing pages to get a feel for things before starting a new book.  But then this prevents creation of subpages of a book from red links.  Yet another limitation of the software: no way to allow creation of subpages but delay creation of new book root pages.  Many times it's difficult to tell whether a new root page is a &quot;test edit&quot; as you call it above or a genuine attempt at a new book.  Yes, we have {{tl|query}} for that, but that's my assessment of the situation.

:I think the devil's advocate probably had the right of it:  requiring an edit count for autopromotion will just create a new incentive for hard-to-spot vandalism.  The primary function of autoconfirmation is to gently steer the mischief of ''casual'' vandals; a lot of vandals are just messing around on the spur of the moment, and aren't going to remain interested for several days to get autoconfirmation.  The ones who do remain interested for several days are a different ilk, and even the ones who, in the event, lose interest in less than a few days might have been [[wikt:incentivize|incentivized]] in the meantime.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:38, 20 July 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Variables also reside in a specific [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Scope|scope]]. The scope of a variable is the most important factor to  determines the life-time of a variable. Entrance into a scope begins the life of a variable and leaving scope ends the life of a variable. A variable is visible when in scope unless it is hidden by a variable with the same name inside an enclosed scope. A variable can be in global scope, {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} scope, file scope or compound statement scope.

As an example, in the following fragment of code, the variable 'i' is in scope only in the lines between the appropriate comments:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
{
  int i; /*'i' is now in scope */
  i = 5;
  i = i + 1;
  cout &lt;&lt; i;
}/* 'i' is now no longer in scope */
&lt;/source&gt;

There are specific keywords that extend the life-time of a variable, and '''''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements#Compound statement|compound statement]]''''' define their own local [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Scope|scope]].

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// Example of a compound statement defining a local scope
{

  {
    int i = 10; //inside a statement block
  }

 i = 2; //error, variable does not exist outside of the above compound statement 
}
&lt;/source&gt;

It is an error to declare the same variable twice within the same level of scope.

The only [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Scope|scope]] that can be defined for a global variable is a {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}}, this deals with the visibility of variable not its validity, being the main purpose to avoid name collisions.

The concept of scope in relation to variables becomes extremely important when we get to classes, as the constructors are called when entering scope and the destructors are called when leaving scope.

{{NOTE|Variables should be declared as local and as late as possible, and ''initialized'' immediately.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear Admins/Anyone,

While understanding the Ayurveda we must be know that we are made from panchmahabut .
Human body has :
3doshas as follow
1.VATA

Acharya has given his definition as follow 
&quot;Dushante te  iti  do shah:&quot;
In Ayurveda vat doesn't mean gases form in body .
Gases formed inside the body due to the perirstaltic movement inside the body .
But Ayurveda concept VAT not formed this way.
It is main causative factor in body which causes the disease .
Disease which occurred due to irregular propagation of vata  no.is 80

If the formal is rigorous but obscures ideas behind lines after lines of proofs, what can the visual offer?

In our mind, we all have the experience that logic to a degree can depend only on image without symbols or language.

Below is an attempt to replace the formal proofs with equally rigorous diagrams.

Your suggestions in the discussion of this page is much appreciated. The problems in this attempt will also be in the discussion.

==For all and there exists==
:* The filled circles are a good example for &quot;for all&quot;; do we need one for &quot;there exists&quot; ?

==an element that may or may not be in a group==
:* how about a filled circle that is on the edge of the round rectangle? [[User:Arydye001|Arydye001]] ([[User talk:Arydye001|talk]]) 22:03, 26 July 2010 (UTC)

==Inverse==
* an empty circle with thick rim and same colour to represent inverse of a filled circle
:* What if the filled circle has one inverse in one group and a different inverse on the other group?
::* We could use the color of the group to represent the inverse. For example, the rim for the original element and the filled color for the group..
:::* Actually we don't need to specify a colour for the group because inverse of an element and the element must be within the same group. 
::::* What if an element and its inverse are both in two groups and the inverse is only under one of the group?
:::::* May be we can put the operator of a group on the groups' round rectangle, that will till that the inverse is due to which group.

:* What if the filled circle has one inverse for one operator and an other one for another operator?
::* hmm, now that is a problem[[User:Arydye001|Arydye001]] ([[User talk:Arydye001|talk]]) 22:03, 26 July 2010 (UTC)
:::* May be we can put the symbol of the operator next to the circle to show that this is the inverse of such and such under this operator.
::::* Symbols.... are they bad?
:::::* Not if you don't use them excessively. [[User:Arydye001|Arydye001]] ([[User talk:Arydye001|talk]]) 22:21, 26 July 2010 (UTC)

:* What if the red circle has one red rimmed inverse in one group and then the red rimmed inverse has another inverse in another group?
::* Can we add another rim, like a red rimmed red rimmed circle? 
:::* Then is our first circle a red rimmed red rimmed red rimmed circle, and our 2nd circle both a red rimmed circle and a red rimmed red rimmed red rimmed red rimmed circle?
::* Is the empty circle a bad idea? Alternatively, we can use a special kind of lines linking the inverse and its element under some symbols to show that they are inverse to each other under some group and some operator?
::* May be we can combine the two ideas, we can use the red rimmed red rimmed circles and the lines together.

==modular arithmetic==

=Are Straight Lines Bad?=
* They surely hide other possibilities. Straight lines make people think the elements and operators can only be connected in certain way.
* A perspective is both informative and biased. [[User:Arydye001|Arydye001]] ([[User talk:Arydye001|talk]]) 15:52, 30 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Appending the File */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Appending the File== 

I tried this, and it worked for everything except for my seat. Nothing happened after I hit Load Library. What could be the problem?


When I tried this, I was unable to move my seat at all. Said that I could not edit the object. 


This noob either (A) linked the seat instead of appending it. when selecting the file, look at the bottom for the append/link options and make &quot;Append&quot; selected. (B) selected &quot;Append or Link (Image Browser)&quot; instead of the option above it in the File menu. (C) tried to enter edit mode without making a new instance of the mesh. 

In '''F9(Editing Panel) -&gt; Link and Materials''' You will see at the top the mesh name &quot;ME: seat&quot; or whatever you called it. To the right there may be a button that makes the mesh data local. Click that if you want to make a copy of the mesh data.


Following the instructions on the above paragraph I was able to append and successfully edit the rocket launcher and the tires of the vehicle. However, for the seats whenever I tried to &quot;copy group&quot; I received a message saying: &quot;can't edit external data&quot;. I triple checked the procedures that I followed and the only difference that I noted was that in the seat case a square icon with the &quot;Li&quot; sylab was shown to the right of the Me: SEAT button. This icon was not, for unknown reasons, shown in the tires or the rocket launcher procedures. 


When you move the body, the seat will stay in his place. To prevent this you must make the body parent of the other parts. For example the seat: first select the seat, then select the body.(so you have them both selected) Now press (CTRL PKEY) and select make parent. If you move the body, the seat will move with it. if you move the seat, the body won't move.

I try to append the file and instead I get the message &quot;nothing indicated&quot;?  PLEASE HELP!  I've been doing pretty good so far...

==Rinse and Repeat==

I may have done something wrong in the Rocket Launcher tutorial, but when I link to the .blend file each object (launcher, mount, and ball bearing) is listed separately and have to be reassembled in the new file. Any suggestions??

When creating the rocket launcher, stay at Edit Mode while adding the meshes that you will turn into the mount and the ball, this way all 3 objects act as one in Object Mode, and can be appended at once.

==Making the windshield transparent==

explain in more depth how to make the windshield transparent

if you quit out of this tutorial while staying in that section of the book, there is a section called &quot;every material known to man&quot; (its near the bottom of the tutorial list) and there are several kinds of glass there.

how do you get just the windshield made out of glass? 

select the faces you want, press f7, ''(note: it's f9 for me [2.47])''then click add under links and materials. Press f5 then add your glass material

I have 2.4.6, and I don't know how to make just the windshield transparent, everytime I try the whole thing is transparent.

You have to create a new material and assign it to the appropriate faces.  In edit mode, select the faces you want (make sure you select both sides of the windshield including: front face, back face, and top face).  On the Editing section (F9 in 2.4.7), under Links and Materials, click the 'New' button under Materials then click the 'Assign' button.  This assigns the new material to the selected faces.  You can then go into the Shading section (F5 in 2.4.7) and adjust the material to be glass.  Make sure you are editing the correct material (if you have just the one texture on the jeep, the default name for the new material should be something like &quot;2 Mat 2&quot;).


==Loseing materials on append==
When I append the files, they lose their materials. When I link the files, I can't move or resize them.

I just figured out that my file is glitching. Append should make it possible to move and resize AND it should keep the material.</text>

At this stage of the inquiry about the impact that Otago Polytechnic's initial developments in open educational practices, the strongest indication of the benefit is expressed in the return on investment (ROI). This is calculated by gains in branding awareness, educational resource quality, and savings in IT infrastructure costs. These measured benefits have led to the recommendation that further investment, with more organisation-wide coordination and commitment, be made. Especially in support service units, so that the impact that open education has, on learning outcomes and teacher job satisfaction across the board, can be more accurately evaluated in comparison to current standard practices.

It was difficult to establish the impact that initial developments in open educational practices have had on learning outcomes without the commitment of the services across the organisation that help promote understanding, establish expectations, and support teaching and learning. It was also difficult to determine how open educational practices impact staffs' sense of job satisfaction and motivation, without the commitment needed by the organisation to recognise and reward such new practices by staff.  

= Gains, savings and costs =
[[Image:ROI per person over 3 years.png|frame|Return on investment after training and resourcing an Otago Polytechnic teacher how to use social media for open education]]
It is estimated to cost $4 000 to train one person how to use social media for open educational practices. At Otago Polytechnic, such a person goes on to return over $8 000 worth of savings and gains to their organisation in the first year. ($3 511.16 per year worth of brand awareness, $1 030.77 per year in quality gains by sampling and reusing free content, and up to $3 461.54 per year worth of savings in IT infrastructure, and support costs by using readily available and popular social media platforms). This study sampled the work of 13 staff, collectively returning $104 045.03 worth of savings and gains to the organisation, from an investment in training made by the organisation worth $52 000.

The evaluation of gains, savings and costs is based on statistical data and a basic return on investment (ROI) calculation. The return is determined by taking the dollar value of over-all gains, adding them to an estimate on over-all savings, and finally subtracting the costs, leaving just the return. That return is divided by the number of people in a convenience sample, to determine a per person contribution.

| ROI = (Gains + Savings - Costs) / Number of practitioners
|}


== Gains ==
Gains are measured for both resource quality improvements and brand awareness marketing.

===Brand awareness===
To determine the brand awareness marketing gains of open educational practices, the return on the existing campaigns of billboards and newspapers are calculated, and a direct comparison is made as follows:
;Newspaper
:*Take the cost of a 1/4 page ad in the main local newspaper in Dunedin (not including design): $629.
:*Divide it by the distribution of 47 000 copies and assume the ad in each paper gets seen by one person.
:*The worth of the brand awareness campaign in the local news paper is 1c per view.

;Billboard
:*Take the cost of one billboard: $3 490 (including banner but not including design).
:*Divide by the stated 19 000 cars passing in a 1 week campaign and assume each car is worth one view.
:*The worth of a billboard is 2c per view. 

;Open educational resource on popular social media
:*The cost of producing an open educational resource is included in the normal teaching practice after training. The cost of training is subtracted at the end of the calculation of return in savings and gains.
:*Assume that an educational resource is worth the combined worth of a newspaper ad and a billboard, based on it being more informative and educational.
:*Combine the worth of a newspaper view and a billboard view to calculate the worth of an open educational resource on popular social media.
:*The worth of an open educational resource is 3c per view.

===Quality gains===
Where an educational resource uses free media within it, this is assumed as a quality gain based on the assumption that the resource did not use media before hand due to a barrier of cost. The monetary worth of this quality gain is determined by the equivalent commercial worth of the free media sampled. 
:*An image is worth $20 based on a low royalty fee rate.
:*An audio track is worth $50 based on a low royalty fee rate.
:*A page of text is worth $50 based on it taking one hour to produce.
:*A five minute video or 10 slide presentation is worth $150 based on it taking three hours to produce.

== Savings ==
Advice from other institutions running equivalent technical infrastructure composed of wikis, blogs and Youtube (as an example of media sharing) is used to establish an estimate of savings in running costs through the use of existing social media platforms. These are true fixed costs per year for setting up and running each system (wiki, media and blog), and do not account for the worth of opportunities implicit in the community of practice built into the open platforms.

:* Wiki platform ~NZ$15 000 - based on [http://wikieducator.org/WikiEducator:OER_Foundation/Information_pack#Monetary_savings_associated_with_membership Wikieducator pricing].
:* Media sharing site ~NZ$20 000 - based on estimates made at [http://uctv.canterbury.ac.nz/spaces/space.php?space_key=1 University of Canterbury's UCTV].
:* Blogging system ~NZ$10 000 - based on equivalent utility service provider charges.

== Costs ==
A review of efforts by the Educational Development Centre to informally train staff in the use of social media for open educational use is used to establish a cost of training per person. For example:

:*10 hours of 1:1 intensive training, including compensation for the trainee's time: $1 000;
:*10 hours of 1:1 support, including compensation for the trainee's time: $1 000;
:*Equipment: $2 000.
:*Total training costs: $4 000 for each staff member.

=Educational outcomes=
The reason it is is difficult to determine meaningfully the impact that open education practices have on educational outcomes  is because it is not sufficient to simply compare statistics of participation, completion and enrollment rates between closed and open courses.  The wider Polytechnic services for supporting students are currently heavily biased towards the standard closed educational practices. Therefore, a comparison would only be meaningful once open educational practices become normalised within the supporting services such as: administration; student services; library; and marketing, with all services communicating a consistent message about learning in open educational contexts.  Otherwise, the factors related to student support (participation, completion and enrollment rates) which are known to impact on educational outcomes may be unfairly compromised in courses using open educational practices.

There are some statistics already available about open courses.  In the instance of Facilitating Online, there was a significant rise in public and international interest in the course in 2008 after it was developed into an open course. This statistic would compare to a normal marketing response rate for a course, but this was the first time international interest was shown. The drop in numbers in 2009, after initial interest and participation from the global community might be attributed to a number of factors.  For example, insufficient support services and policy to assist informal learners to progress to enroll as formal learners, or costs of enrollment for international students. The subsequent rise of participation in 2010 might be an indication that the course redevelopment and administration is stabilising, and that there is more understanding of the open model in the organisation. Once an adequate level of support and policy is achieved, it is hoped that enrollment and completion rates will rise to meet the levels of interest. To achieve this, the fee to international students needs to be reviewed, and options of recognition of prior learning assessment need to be implemented.


==Digital literacy in Art==
* [http://digitalliteracyinart.net/ Project report]

:In 2007, the Art School undertook some analysis of the software skills  of the current students enrolled in the Bachelor of Fine Arts (Photography). 
:* There were 95% under 30 years old, and 84% of those were between 20 and 25 years old (i.e. most students come straight from school).
:* Computer skills: all had basic skills, and 70% had intermediate skills.
:* Image-editing skills: all had basic image-editing skills, but only 10% had intermediate skills.

:In 2009, the skills of the students enrolled in the senior courses in photography, who participated in the digital literacy course were at a higher level than the 2007 class.
:* Computer skills: 100% all had intermediate skills, and 70% had advanced skills.
:* Image-editing skills: 100% had intermediate skills, and 70% had advanced skills.
:* Additional skills: 90% students had social networking skills that they regularly used to enhance and develop their artistic practice.
:* Additional skills: 50% of students used additional (to photographic equipment) digital tools regularly to enhance and develop their artistic practice.
:* Additional skills: 90% students had a web site/web presence to market themselves.

:In 2010, several improvements in digital capability were measured.
:* All students (100%) in the electronic arts and photography studios submitted their workbooks online.
:* All students (100%) in the Art School accessed their learning resources online for art history and theory.
:* Half the students (50%) in other senior disciplines engaged with online resources on a daily basis.
:* All first year BVA and Diploma students (100% ) had and maintained a blog for their studio research.
:* The majority of postgraduate students (80% ) maintained an online presence.

:'''In summary'''. 
: Prior to the introduction of digital literacy in 2007, ''none'' of the students in the School of Art submitted their studio workbooks as blogs.
:In 2008, this increased to 20% of photography and electronic arts students with a smattering of students in other studios engaging in online practices.

: Without any significant change to students' digital literacy there probably would have been a gradual increase in the number of students engaging with online teaching materials. With support for digital literacy there has been a substantial shift in the philosophy and practice in the School of Art and this is reflected in the above statistics.

: The practices of embedding digital literacy within the core components of an Art School experience have been proven to shift learner experience and give students real choice in their engagements with the online world. This is an improved educational outcome and has made a very real difference to learner experience at the Dunedin School of Art.

=Research study: Staff Perspectives on the Practice of Open Education=
A research study was commissioned by Otago Polytechnic to a third party research team to establish how open educational practices were understood by Otago Polytechnic staff, and how they were impacting on their sense of job satisfaction, motivation, and their perceptions of teaching and learning performance (values). The research resulted in the University of Otago Report for Otago Polytechnic: '''''[http://wikieducator.org/images/b/b1/OP_Staff_Perspectives_on_OE.pdf Otago Polytechnic Staff Perspectives on the Practice of Open Education].''''' Prepared by Russell Butson, Shelagh Ferguson, and Carla Thomson in May 2010.

Five participants took part in the research which used a videography methodology. A wider sample, would have provided more certainty regarding the findings, however, some valuable information was revealed. For example, there was a clear connection between participants' beliefs of Open Education and their actual practice.  However, there appeared to be a level of immaturity in the participants' understanding of open educational practices, for example, sharing open resources. Participants spoke exclusively about the resources they had created and shared, and made no reference to using open resources from other providers.  Three stages of of practice in the use of open resources were found: 
:* no interest in sharing resources;
:* an interest in sharing their resources with other; and
:* an interest in open reciprocal sharing of resources.

The impact of open education practices on job satisfaction, motivation, and perceptions of teaching and learning performance were not clearly ascertained.  The findings indicate there is a need for strategic commitment to open education, and how it is supported, recognised and rewarded. 

 
==Introduction==
This small scale ethnographic study, as part of the larger Ako Aotearea study, was designed to investigate the ways in which a convenience sample of teaching staff understood and interacted with open education resources. The research sample did not seek to be representative of the Polytechnic’s teaching staff, but represented informants who could give particular insight and depth to the research. The researchers aimed to determine staffs' views on the use of open education resources, and to gain insights into how staff understood and valued their work in open education. To this end, a number of staff members took part in videotaped interviews where they discussed and demonstrated their open education practice.

It is important to note that the research was undertaken within the backdrop of the Otago Polytechnic’s open resource intellectual property policy which uses a default Creative Commons by attribution copyright. The staff interviewed were clearly aware of the policy and felt encouraged and supported in their quest to explore the open sharing of resources.

==Rationale for Videography==
The researchers wanted the data to be determined by the beliefs and experiences of the participants, and therefore, did not wish to employ a method that imposed an external theoretical framework to define or compartmentalize the data they were seeking. Videography is not premised on the existence of an underlying conceptual scheme, or deep structure for explaining behaviour, rather it allows researchers to capture a vast array of thoughts, ideas, beliefs and expectations as they occur in mutual exchange and negotiation. As a methodology, videography allows the capture of rich and thick data that gives insight into practice and underpinning values.

==Ethical Considerations==
Ethical approval (Category B) for this study was provided by Higher Education Development Centre, University of Otago. Before participants were interviewed, they were provided with ethics approved information sheets and consent forms (Appendix 5). They all gave written consent to be part of this project.

The participant interviews were video recorded and partially transcribed. The video files were only available to the researchers. The actual video records were not included in any research outputs, and the transcriptions were altered to remove any identifying information prior to use in research outputs (reports, publications, and conference papers). Those participants who requested it were given digital copies of their video interview. To maintain anonymity, the participants are represented, in this report and in any written research outputs, by anonymous markers.

==Recruitment/sampling==
This project employed purposeful sampling. To achieve the aim of gaining some deep understanding into staff views and experiences with open education, the researchers built a convenient sample from staff who had used open education resources. Eight faculty members who were involved in the provision of open education resources were invited via email to be interviewed. Five agreed and were interviewed.

==Data Collection==
Interviews were conducted in the participants’ work space (home or office). One researcher conducted the interview while another videoed it. The interviews were semi-structured, in that the researcher had a predetermined set of questions or interview schedule. However, the style of the questions was open-ended allowing for responsiveness to the lead of the interviewee, and some latitude in terms of relevance. In addition to answering interview questions, the interviewees demonstrated their practice with open education resources online.

==Data Analysis==
The participants’ video recordings were dealt with through an iterative process in which the researchers viewed, annotated, partially transcribed, and coded the video files according to emerging themes. These processes were facilitated by NVivo software. After gathering and working with data on the level of individual participants, the research team employed an inductive, iterative analytical approach. Under this approach, the data was subjected to multiple readings. This allowed for the identification of themes within and across the video records and interview transcripts (see appendix 1,-4). Using a constant comparative approach , the researchers moved backwards and forwards among the data, gradually moving from coding to conceptual categories and then to theory development.

==Outcomes/Findings==
The length of the four interviews ranged from 40 minutes to just over an hour long with 238 minutes (3.97 hours) in total of interview footage being recorded. Each semi-structured interview began with the interviewer asking about the participant’s philosophy of teaching and learning. Depending on the direction established by the response to this initial question, the participants moved on to discuss, over the course of the interview, their perceptions of open education, and their reasons for using open education resources. They also demonstrated and discussed the ways they used open education resources, and specific functionality/applications, for example, blogs, and Youtube.

These general commonalities notwithstanding, each participant had a different focus, or position in relation to open education. Consequently, the interviews each had a very different ‘flavour’ and the resulting video data were rich and diverse. Four overarching/main themes emerged from the interviews.
* Rationale for Open Education.
* Practice of Open Education.
* Resistance to Open Education.
* Beliefs about Teaching and Learning.

The majority of the interview data was categorised according to these themes. All the participants made interview comments which fell under each theme. Table 1 below shows the total number of comments made in relation to each theme, and the percentage of the total video footage which these comments covered. For example, the participants made 106 comments which were coded at the ‘rationale for open education’, covering 35% of the total interview footage.

'''Table 1: Interview comments and coverage according to theme'''

As can be seen in Table 1, rationale for, and practice of open education were the focus of a greater percentage of interviews compared to resistance to open education and beliefs about teaching and learning.

Evidently having a sound rationale of open education is likely to result in behaviours that are clearly aligned with open education practice. While this result is only built on the experience of five people, the researchers believe the self reports of these participants, as they expressed their beliefs and outlined their practice, revealed a sound coupling between having a rationale and actual practice. Their conclusion on this point is that for Open Education to work, the organisation needs to signal a clear message (e.g., through policy) that encourages and supports the practice.  Secondly the organisation needs to engage its population in promoting a clear understanding of the rationale and value of this approach. Finally, the adoption by the organisation of an ‘open’ schema would result in a change in practice. 

The participants in this study, while having a clear rationale, appear to be a minority within the institution. It is possible that the lack of champions (staff with a clear rationale for Open Education) may be the reason Otago Polytechnic, regardless of its institutional support for open resources, appears to have poor uptake regarding actual open education practice. However, the research sample was small and further research is needed to validate this observation.
 
It is interesting to note that the participants spoke exclusively about the resources they had created and shared. There was no reference to using open resources from other providers. The impression the researchers were left with was that staff interviewed had all moved from a ‘no interest’ state to one of ‘interest’ (Figure-2). With only one of the participants showing any interest or understanding of resource sharing as a collaborative reciprocal process, the researchers concluded that the four other staff members were at what is defined as stage-2: a rather egocentric state where the focus was exclusively on their resource. One other participant had moved away from this position, and was clearly more aware of the benefits when open resources were both shared and sourced.

'''Figure‐2: Stages of practice in the use of open resources.'''
[[Image:Stages of practice in the use of open resources.png]]

While the above schema (Figure-2) emerged from analysis of the data, the researchers cannot say for sure, without further research, that the three states are necessarily part of a continuum. They foresee that it is likely that staff could move along this continuum with the right type of support and development aimed at facilitating a change in attitude and hence practice. It is worth mentioning that the discussions in this study were around open resources, and the acknowledgment of authorship associated with these. The researchers did not discuss concealed use of resources that may occur at stage-1, and which are often repackaged and do not include acknowledgment to the original author/creator.

The findings suggest two essential elements are important if an institution wishes to promote the open development and sharing of educational resources. Firstly, institutional support (ref-OP policy of OE) for open distribution of educational resources is required, and secondly shared understanding of, and rationale for the free distribution of educational resources is necessary. It is not unusual in studies looking at beliefs and practice to find a disconnect between these aspects, and one that is often comfortably maintained. However, what is interesting in this study is the clear connection between the participants' beliefs of open education and their practice.

To finish a key issue is raised which the researchers struggled with: what actually is Open Education? Firstly, the participants did not raise this as an issue. There appeared to be a general understanding about the meaning of Open Education which allowed all the participants to talk from a similar perspective. It was paramount for the researchers to 'dig a bit deeper' regarding the scope of Open Education in order to develop an understanding prior to any analysis. It became clear to them very early on that Open Education was a parent idea that incorporated such practice as resource sharing (Open Education Resources). While the participants used Open Education on many occasions – the researchers believe they were actually referring to Open Education Resources. In fact all of the interview material was essentially focusing on the open sharing of resources. This raised the issue of whether to define education as resources or by programme. The question arose, were the resources valuable on their own, or did they only make sense when embedded within a programme? 

Answering this question was not part of this research, but was something that surfaced as a result. The researchers hope that further research into Open Education can explore this issue more fully.

In this chapter is outlined a model for educational development, largely based on Otago Polytechnic's pioneering work in the period 2006-2009. In that time, Otago adopted a [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/ Creative Commons Attribution] copyright license default, and supported staff using popular media sharing and communication services such as Wikipedia, Wikiversity and Youtube to develop open educational practices and publish open educational resources. 

==Otago's Educational Development Centre==

In 2006, Otago Polytechnic established an Educational Development Centre (EDC) for staff development, curriculum development, online and flexible learning development, and research into educational development. This was an extension of a smaller staff development unit set up in the years prior. By mid 2006, the polytechnic established a contestable fund for departments and staff to apply for assistance in developing flexible teaching and assessment practices in their courses. This fund was called the Flexible Learning Development Fund and was mediated by EDC. By the end of 2006, three EDC Programme Developers were project managing around 20 courses and educational development projects initiated by staff through the fund, as well as through research grants.&lt;ref&gt;This is the account of Leigh Blackall and Bronwyn Hegarty, project managers in EDC at that time&lt;/ref&gt; 

Throughout 2006, staff in EDC were researching open educational resources and practices using social media, and recommended that Otago Polytechnic position itself through such practices, using open education and social media in flexible learning training and development projects. Ad-hoc workshops in blogging, tagging, RSS and wiki editing saw a number of staff start to adopt the techniques and join discussions on their use in education.&lt;ref&gt;This program was written up on Wikieducator (http://wikieducator.org/Networked_learning) with a copy being further developed on Wikiversity (http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Networked_Learning)&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, EDC was running a Graduate Certificate in Tertiary Learning and Teaching qualification,&lt;ref&gt;Internet Archive, Way Back Machine, [http://web.archive.org/web/20081014204337/http://www.otagopolytechnic.ac.nz/index.php?id=172&amp;PID=EDC%20LT7 Records of GCTLT in October 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; as part of an Otago Polytechnic-wide initiative to train all teaching staff to a high level of teaching qualification. Several staff who were teaching courses in the program started experimenting with the use of social media, and developed open and flexible learning and assessment methods through the use of such media. Some of these models are outlined in this chapter.

In 2007 and 2008, EDC staff assisted Otago Polytechnic executive in the development of an intellectual property policy that maintained ownership with creators, but encouraging those owners to adopt open educational practices by using a Creative Commons Attribution copyright license, and publishing and distributing information through social media channels, with Wikieducator as a primary developmental space.&lt;ref&gt;Internet Archive, Way Back Machine, [http://web.archive.org/web/20100212232448/http://www.otagopolytechnic.ac.nz/research/intellectual-property-and-copyright.html Records from 12 Feb 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;. Notable also in Otago Polytechnic's approach to IP was the autonomous position held by local Māori iwi (tribe) Ngāi Tahu. In 2008, Otago Polytechnic signed the Cape Town Declaration, ceremoniously cementing Otago Polytechnic's commitment to open education. More information on the intellectual property policy, and is later adoption by staff at the University of Canberra, can be found in the chapter on [[Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Intellectual_Property_Policy|Intellectual Property]]. And there is a chapter with more information on the [[Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Cape_Town_Declaration|signing of the Cape Town Declaration]].

In 2008 and 2009 EDC staff started evaluating the impact that this early adoption of open educational practices was having in the organisation, using small research grants from a New Zealand national funding agency - AKO Aoteraroa.&lt;ref&gt;Otago Polytecnic, Educational Development Centre, [http://www.otagopolytechnic.ac.nz/schools-departments/educational-development-centre/open-education.html Open Education]. Retrieved November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This book is one of the outcomes of that evaluation.

==Blogging professional development: An Otago Polytechnic experience==

Through 2006 and 2007, EDC ran a range of professional development activities for staff, including two courses which used social media to encourage networking: [http://flexible-learning-course.blogspot.com/ Flexible Learning] (which was part of the Graduate Certificate in Learning and Teaching), and [http://facilitatingonlinecommunities.blogspot.com/ Facilitating Online Communities] (which was part of the Graduate Certificate in Applied eLearning). These courses, along with numerous informal workshops and professional networks, helped to develop critical digital and network literacy,&lt;ref&gt;Blackall, L. 2005. [http://itdl.org/journal/dec_05/article01.htm Digital Literacy: how it affects teaching practices and networked learning futures - a proposal for action research]. ''International Journal for Instructional Technology and Distance Learning''. Retrieved 2012-11-22&lt;/ref&gt; particularly social media, as well as increased general awareness among staff of popular Internet-based resources and networked learning.

During this period, there were a handful of Polytechnic staff actively documenting their work and progress on individual weblogs. By subscribing to the RSS feeds from these blogs EDC was able to monitor and assess the experiments, ideas and methods, issues and concerns, and of course the development of digital literacy and networked communication skills. They could also observe the progress of specific projects, and in some instances, notes on professional development courses that staff kept on their weblogs. With this level of access to staff work, EDC could enter into discussions, offer support and advice, and point to examples when needed. Likewise, staff could monitor each other's work, and over time, reflect back on their own. The objective was to establish a network of professional learning through weblogs and other platforms. By comparison, obtaining this level of access and insight through traditional communication channels (such as face-to-face meetings, email or formal reporting) was not only inefficient, it lacked accurate primary or authentic source, or opportunities for wider consultation.

However, the number of Polytechnic staff engaging in this practice was extremely small. The benefits and barriers of staff blogging needs to be carefully analysed to more fully understand the implications of things like organisational power dynamics and other issues that might impact on the development of a successful network of professional learning. It might perhaps be an overly simplistic idea, but it is as yet untested, and that is to offer incentives in the form of recognition and reward for staff who document their work on professional weblogs. More on this in the chapter on [[Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Recommendations_for_developing_open_education_practices|Recommendations]].

Primarily, the use of weblogs (blogs) at Otago Polytechnic was encouraged by EDC staff as a simple device for developing digital literacy and critical awareness of online networking and communications.  Staff were supported where possible to use a blog to document projects and professional development, with a view that the regularity of writing online would inevitably lead people to use hypertext referencing, optimised and embedded media, widgets] and style sheets, and to add or create their own media. This was expected to not only help staff develop digital literacy, but also to assist them in gaining independent online communication skills, and critical awareness of what it meant to have a professional presence within a network of professional learning, online.

In terms of networking through blogs, on a local scale it was observable - in those who were blogging and using an RSS reader to track other's blogs - that there was a gradual increase in awareness of what people were doing, the advances they were making, and the issues they were facing, and that local connections were developing online and helping to support informal learning and development in the organisation - including attendance at face to face meetings and events. Over time it was hoped that this local awareness and communication would strengthen and extend more into a national and international networks. Such connection was observed in at least two staff members from Otago's Midwifery Department. Sarah Stewart established her blog into an international learning network, peaking with the coordination of the Virtual International Day of the Midwife.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, S. [Sarah-Stewart weblog category, Virtual International Day of the Midwife http://sarah-stewart.blogspot.com.au/search/label/International%20Day%20of%20the%20Midwife]&lt;/ref&gt;. And Caorlyn McIntosh is now referred to as a top-20 midwifery blogger internationally.&lt;ref&gt;http://mymidiblog.blogspot.co.nz/2012/12/i-am-in-top-20-midwifery-blogs.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

While this activity, at the small scale it developed to, indicated that professional weblogging did help to improve professional engagement, digital literacy and critical awareness, the larger goal was to transfer these skills and awareness into open educational practices and improve services to potential and existing students. Extended thinking around this vision is expressed further in the [[Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Models_of_Open_Education|Models of Open Education]] chapter.

==The importance of copyright, from an organisation's perspective==

Toward the end of 2006,  the creation of new educational content began in the Flexible Learning Development projects of Otago Polytechnic. It was apparent that many people who were involved in the projects did not have an understanding of copyright, specifically content with copyrights that permitted reuse. Nor did many have experience in producing media other than text documents and slide presentations. Work began to try and build skills in locating free and reusable content, and compiling new content and distributing it through popular media sharing sites.

This consequently highlighted the need to change the organisation's Intellectual Property (IP) policy so as to enable the legitimate reuse of open educational resources. Also apparent was the need to establish new librarian services to help with the sourcing of free content, and an alignment of media production teams such as in the Marketing department, to assist with production and distribution. Otago Polytechnic has not been able to establish these levels of support. More about this concept is detailed in the [[Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Recommendations_for_developing_open_education_practices|Recommendations]] chapter, and a response from executive as to why the suggested support was not established is found in the [[Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Responses|Responses chapter]].

By mid 2007, a new IP policy was agreed on,&lt;ref&gt;Internet Archive, Way Back Machine, [http://web.archive.org/web/20100212232448/http://www.otagopolytechnic.ac.nz/research/intellectual-property-and-copyright.html records from 12 February 2010] and Wikieducator, [http://wikieducator.org/index.php?title=Otago_Polytechnic/Intellectual_property&amp;action=history Otago Polytechnic, Intellectual Property Policy, document history. Retrieved December 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledging that staff and students were entitled to have individual ownership over their IP, and encouraging the use of a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license as the preferred copyright statement on works published through the Polytechnic. Individual owners of IP who wished to publish with restrictions beyond attribution were required to notify the Polytechnic so that an appropriate restrictive statement could be added. In short, the ''All Rights Reserved'' default for content created at Otago Polytechnic was replaced by a ''Some Rights Reserved - Attribution'' default with an optional process for individuals to further restrict rights. This was a simple inversion to what was common in most other educational institutions at the time.

The IP policy was seen as a mechanism in Otago Polytechnic for dispelling staff uncertainties about engaging with the wider Internet, and was used to reinforce the effort to encourage publishing in blogs and other media sharing services; as well as to contribute to international wiki projects like Wikipedia, individually and/or in the name of the polytechnic. Such activity was seen to be beneficial to the Polytechnic, on the basis of the policy attracting wide recognition for its progressiveness, and for encouraging more widely distributed content referring to the Polytechnic and the courses and services it offered.

At the time, an issue was raised however, with suggestions to use copyright restrictions beyond Attribution, such as Share Alike - or similar copyleft mechanisms such as GPL ([http://cplus.about.com/od/glossar1/g/gpldefinition.htm General Public Licence]) which require derivatives to use the same or equal license as the Share Alike restricted license. The problem was that if a staff member sampled and remixed a work with such a license, the derivative work would them have to carry the same license and that might have been not always possible, such as when mixed with sensitive cultural content, commercial content, or other such content that required restriction, or when working with people who were not comfortable with releasing copyrights. For this reason, for simplicity and to ensure maximum flexibility in the use of resources, it was decided to endorse the Creative Commons Attribution license as the default copyright license used.

==Working with Wikis==

In mid 2007, following the agreement for a new IP policy, some of the educational development projects of Otago Polytechnic began using wikis to develop educational resources. These included Wikispaces, Wikiversity and Wikieducator. Early work with Wikispaces indicated a risk of platform lock-in and a lack of quality control with regards to copyright diligence. This led to a focus on Wikiversity. A combination of concerns however, led to a decision to suspend work on Wikiversity, and use Wikieducator. There were three reasons for this decision. Firstly, at the time (but no longer) a minority of members in Wikiversity's user community expressed concerns on the appropriate use of the platform by educational organisations. Secondly, some departments within the Polytechnic had concerns over the use of platforms outside the control of the Polytechnic (concerns that were later dispelled). And thirdly, a lobby from The Commonwealth of Learning to adopt their Wikieducator platform, along with offers of support in training and policy development. 

At the time, there were at least 15 full time Otago Polytechnic lecturing staff, and five part time designers regularly using the WikiEducator platform to develop their courses. Others developed textbooks on Wikibooks, some moved back into Wikiversity and many were referring to Wikipedia for information and resources in their teaching and study. This number was expected to increase when the teacher training schedules used by Otago Polytechnic started to include orientation and skills development in the use of wikis.

'''Benefits of using wikis'''
*Free content hosting;
*Free and supported access to MediaWiki software;
*Exposure, promotion and networking with other educational organisations;
*Internationalisation and dialogue with others interested in educational development;
*Collaborative development opportunities and resource sharing;
*Open access to learning resources;
*Staff development of MediaWiki editing skills that are transferable to more popular MediaWiki based projects like Wikipedia.

Through developing curriculum and content on Wikieducator and Wikiversity, Otago Polytechnic staff discovered there were opportunities for local collaboration, and ironically, they did this before realising the benefits of international collaboration. This occurred because of the open nature of the development, enabling local staff to discover each others work, and as a result they contacted colleagues to discuss collaboration. It was also easier for the educational developers who were working with staff to refer them to the open resources which were being developed, and in this way collaborations were facilitated. In contrast, the teachers working in the closed environment of the Learning Management System (LMS) that was being used at the time, were unaware whether there was similar content being developed elsewhere on that platform, or were developing in such a way that made it very difficult to collaborate and reuse resources in other areas. Furthermore, they could not benefit from the volunteer support that the wikis came with, who checked copyright diligence, and assisted with layout and copy editing.

Because of their open and accessible nature, and tendency to attract volunteers by virtue of the cause of open education, development in wiki environments found efficiency gains in things like quality control such as copyright, copy editing, linking and layout assistance. The wiki projects required all content to be cleared of restrictive copyrights. This discipline of diligence has resulted in the production of works that are very flexible and reusable. Conversely, the closed development environment of the LMS has traditionally enabled very little quality control on copyright, and therefore, a large amount of restricted content was being used, which ultimately limited the flexibility and reusability of resources, and led to the payment of royalty fees to gathering agencies. In this sense, development on wikis is arguably more efficient and financially and socially sustainable, achieving more with the allocated investments.

==Risks and foreseeable issues==

A focus on blogging as a method of professional development, communication and organisational knowledge management risks segmenting communications further in the organisation, between those who rely on word of mouth, email, meetings, and those who come to rely on online networks. In the Otago Polytechnic experience, while several staff took up the use of blogging, using it as a form of communication with colleagues, the approach remained foreign and new to the majority of staff at the Polytechnic. Most people could not see the value to them personally or professionally, or how they may begin to develop strategies to manage the time it takes for reading and/or writing weblogs. It is reasonable to expect that the majority of staff will not want to keep a weblog, or will not actively monitor the blogging efforts of their colleagues. While there are demonstrated benefits to those that do, a communication disconnect may emerge between those that do and those that do not. This could prove counter productive to the organisation as a whole. 

While it is logical to compare this development to that of the uptake of email some 15 years ago, blogging has many obvious differences to email. For example, a weblog is owned by the individual, and becomes their personalised online space, enabling a unique online presence and identity to develop.  Staff can use this presence to promote themselves professionally, and to become a player in socially networked communities. If disconnection is to be avoided amongst staff, the Polytechnic will need to continue thinking about and developing communication strategies that are effective and useful to all staff, and carefully consider ways to scale the benefits of blog reading and writing. One way of doing this is to use strategies which model more open and collaborative communication.  One suggestion, aimed at bridging different communication channels and preferences, and to facilitate their reach to a wider range of readers, includes the use of an organisational blog, and a blog for each service area or department. For example, a blog could be used in addition to email and static web page broadcasts for the following:
*public press releases;
*staff updates;
*meeting minutes;
*service area and departmental updates.

Staff may consider the use of a blog as time consuming, however, there are methods with which these additional communication channels can be integrated without double-handling the message, e.g., automatic forwarding to email from each blog post. The practice can be time saving and facilitate more effective communication and collaboration. For example if meeting minutes are compiled on a wiki or a Google document, any staff member involved in the meeting can contribute to the minutes, therefore, the information is much more accessible than archived text documents, and probably more accurate and current.

The leadership of EDC staff, in the use of social media, occurred without close and regular consultation with other service providers in the Polytechnic, for example, Information Technology, web publishing, marketing, or human resources. While this enabled rapid development, it posed a significant risk to all those providers; any aspect could have proved counter productive to their briefs. The solution relates in part to the need for a better communication strategy, and active leadership within and across the service providers.

The development of digital information skills and capability, in both staff and students, is critical for participation in digital educational environments especially those which use open education resources ([http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/publications/tertiary_education/80624 Hegarty, Penman, Kelly, Jeffrey, Coburn &amp; McDonald], 2010). These researchers recommend that the provision of learning programmes for the development of digital information literacy must: &quot;Have personal relevance for individuals and be integrated into everyday, work and study contexts&quot;, and &quot;Allow learners the opportunity to ‘play’ and engage in supported exploration, as well as exposing them to new tools and strategies for organising a digital PLE or presence in a networked environment (Web 2.0)&quot;. For this to occur, the &quot;Infrastructure at tertiary education institutions should be continually reviewed, in order to capitalise on the benefits of consistent access for staff and students to the latest web technologies, while recognising the ongoing need for security.&quot; 

Organisations which do not provide environments and conditions conducive to developing capability in using and managing digital information are at risk of falling behind in meeting the requirements of the New Zealand Digital Strategy ([http://www.digitalstrategy.govt.nz/Digital-Strategy-2/ Ministry of Economic Development], 2008) for connectivity, connectivity, capability, confidence and increased digital content ([http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/publications/tertiary_education/80624 Hegarty et al.], 2010).

==Conclusion==

Otago Polytechnic has taken rapid and significant steps in the direction of open educational resources and practices. In the space of less than two years it has positioned itself as a leader in New Zealand, by being the first educational organisation to develop and adopt an intellectual policy that encourages the use of Creative Commons licensing. The willingness of academic staff to experiment with open education and social media, and support for this by managers, has contributed to the development of OER policies and practices. So far the Polytechnic has chosen not to duplicate the features of popular media services, e.g., Youtube, 'in house' and is seeking to maximise the benefits of using external services. In so doing, the Polytechnic is developing a strong and distributed online presence. Additionally,  staff are developing important literacies, transferable skills, and critical awareness of online communications, relevant to life outside the Polytechnic, and more generally to the Otago community. The speed at which this change has taken effect in the Polytechnic has left some service areas unprepared, and is having both positive and negative effects on internal communication. So far the benefits are outweighing the disadvantages, and through continued staff development activities Otago Polytechnic expects these disadvantages will diminish.

During the early years of the 2000s, the words &quot;open education&quot; were only heard in the context of the broader phrase &quot;open educational resources.&quot; This usage pattern unfortunately focused the minds of people almost exclusively on content, subtly nudging them away from considering the broader potential for the application of the principle of openness in education generally. And while OER are a critically important portion of modern educational infrastructure, they are only that - infrastructure. 

Across a variety of contexts, the development and availability of high quality infrastructure is important for enabling valuable services and facilitating innovation. Education is no different. As OER became more widely available in the mid-2000s, thinking began to extend to open education itself - the practices, policies, and pedagogies that enable the sharing of OER as well as the new practices, policies, and pedagogies enabled by OER. This book describes some of these practices and policies.

I hope this book will help bring us to a time when institutional policy and government requirements encourage us to focus on the principle of openness as much as we currently focus on the principle of diversity. I hope this book will encourage people to broaden their thinking about openness and education. But most importantly, I hope this book will help bring people to the understanding that OER and openness are a means only and not an end, and that the only worthy end is a student who has learned something they find valuable. To the degree that applying the principles, practices, and pedagogies suggested by the principle of openness help learners learn things they value, we should all work to make openness a core value of our education institutions.

The factors that define open educational resources and practices, according to the educational development work at Otago Polytechnic between 2006 and 2009, are examined here. There are variations of opinion on such definitions of open education resources and practices, so readers should not see this as the 'only way', but some of many ways. It is hoped that the information here will inspire others to try these ideas, and contribute to the gathering of evidence and stable models that support approaches to open education. The evidence and models which have been gathered are available in the [[Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Open_education_development_and_evaluation|Development]] chapter.

==Introduction and background==
Otago Polytechnic is a small public education and training institution in the South of New Zealand with high student participation, retention and completion rates that according to the Annual reports continue to increase each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otagopolytechnic.ac.nz/about/corporate-information/annual-reports.html Otago Polytechnic's Annual Reports]&lt;/ref&gt; The institution took initial steps toward developing new approaches to open educational resources and practices in the period between 2006 - 2009. They started to develop open resources, and use socially networked information and communication techniques to publish and distribute those resources, with an eye towards an Education 3.0 future&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | == 12 | issue == 3 | last == Keats and Schmidt | title == The Genesis and emergence of Education 3.0 in higher education and its potential for Africa | journal == First Monday | accessdate == 2011-02-17 | year == 2007 | url == http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1625/1540 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The factors underpinning Otago Polytechnic's decision to engage in open education are many, and some of them are outlined here. The Otago Polytechnic case sets the scene for this guide, and a description and analysis of the issues and findings follows.  

As of February 2011, the Wikipedia entry agrees with Jan Hylén's definition for OER as:

{{quote|''&quot;digitised materials offered freely and openly for educators, students and self-learners to use and reuse for teaching, learning and research.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first==Jan |last==Hylén |title == Giving Knowledge for Free: The Emergence of Open Educational Resources|place == Paris, France|publisher == OECD Publishing|year == 2007|page == 30|doi == 10.1787/9789264032125-en|accessdate == 2010-12-03|url == http://www.sourceoecd.org/education/9789264031746}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This book extends the definition into the area of practice. 

In 2007, a report called: Networks, Connections and Community: Learning with Social Software, was prepared by Val Evans Consultants for the Australian Flexible Learning Framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last == Evans | first == Val | | title == Networks, Connections and Community: Learning with Social Software | journal == Australian Flexible Learning Framework: Research and Policy Advice | accessdate == 2009 | year == 2007 | url == http://www.flexiblelearning.net.au/flx/go/pid/377}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the report is discussed current and future uses of socially networked software in educational settings; specifically pointing out the need for open educational resources, diverse professional networks and embedded new practices. 

Such material depicts a steadily increasing trend in the education sector that is by and large a response to the significant successes of social-justice driven innovations such as the Wikimedia Foundation projects, Open Source Software and related social and economic perspectives generally&lt;ref&gt;n+1 editors (2010).

The obviously disrupting force of the Internet, the vastly popular market driven self publishing platforms such as blogs, audio, video and photo sharing services - otherwise known as social media, are all inevitably impacting on institutional practices, and ultimately policy decisions. However - while the Internet inherently lends itself to openness, and to a large degree has brought about the need for more open practices in sectors that rely on information and communications technologies&lt;ref&gt;Shirky, C. [http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2012/11/napster-udacity-and-the-academy/ Napster, Udacity and the Academy]. ''Clay Shirky Blog''. Retrieved 2012-11-21&lt;/ref&gt; - things like copyright laws, incomplete or incompatible intellectual property policies, cultural sensitivities, commercial operations, and general ignorance are all issues that need to be overcome if educational institutions are to realise the benefits of open educational resources and practices. 

Here, the experience of Otago Polytechnic is described to depict some of the principles and practices that can be associated with OER.

==Otago Polytechnic's initial steps==
In 2006, the Educational Development Centre was resourced specifically to assist the institute in developing the organisational flexible learning strategy. This included online learning, and expanded to include a range of social media and open web platforms. As a result the work of a small number of early OER adopters from a range of departments grew, and their work is documented through the Wikieducator page for Otago Polytechnic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikieducator.org/Otago_Polytechnic Wikieducator page for Otago Polytechnic]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Educational Development Centre led collaborative developments of open educational resources on wikis. Already established platforms, which were inviting open participation from people interested in developing educational resources, were preferred - as opposed to setting up platforms internally. At the time, in 2006 and 2007, there were two major projects attracting a large number of participants - Wikiversity (part of the Wiki Media Foundation) and Wikieducator (then set up by the Commonwealth of Learning).

* Wikiversity is a project under the Wiki Media Foundation, and as the name implies, is a space for content that focuses on education (not just higher education). The Wiki Media Foundation manages the Wikipedia project, as well as a number of others such as Wikibooks, Wikisource and Wikinews.
* Wikieducator is a very similar initiative by the Commonwealth of Learning using the same wiki platform as Wikiversity - Mediawiki. Wikieducator is now located within The Open Education Resource (OER) Foundation which was officially launched on 17 September 2009 at Otago Polytechnic.

All of these initiatives have developed into major open educational resource projects. The most notable difference to earlier Open Courseware projects, such as that of MIT, is that they use a wiki platform, which extends the principle of access to reuse and participation. Otago Polytechnic's Educational Development Centre participated in both the Wikimedia Foundation and WikiEducator projects, considered the quality of activity on each, as well as gauging the level of interest among Otago Polytechnic staff for such project spaces. Initial work on both initiatives was largely encouraging with some staff quickly recognising the benefits of open and collaborative authoring in wiki environments. 

==Benefits for using wikis in content development==
Working on a wiki was found by academic staff to have several benefits, and they included: 
* Open access to resources making them easily reusable on other platforms;
* Information which was easy to edit, making development much more participatory, rather than reliant on developers;
* Improved usability provided by a standardised interface helping to ensure a base line quality standard;
* Version control and records of edit history which were always available;
* Communication channels behind every level of content where participants could leave messages for collaborators;
* Changes to the way staff in an organisation shared content and ideas, leading to a participatory culture in open educational resource development.

As well as general benefits associated with using wiki platforms, there are specific benefits associated with using Wikiversity, Wikibooks and Wikieducator. For example, participants immediately have access to a ready made platform, and become part of a larger community of practice which is ready to assist with development, proof reading, editing and translation at no cost, plus there are opportunities for networking with an international community of practice in each topic area. The publicity for educational institutions participating in such initiatives is extended once content is open on the Internet, and this provides a broader audience.  Also the use of a neutral platform that is not seen to be owned by competitors is conducive to cross institutional collaboration. Additionally the capability building of staff is more in line with contemporary developments of the Internet, that being social media and Web 2.0.

==Problems with using wikis==
There were some concerns associated with using wikis. For example, the control of content development is very dependent on the level of participation, and ultimately appears &quot;messy&quot; during the early phases of development. Sometimes subject areas are started, but not finished; and may indicate tentative testing. Although these wiki platforms provide an opportunity for educational institutions to establish a strong presence, a lack of time or commitment by editors, or no organisational support and recognition for the early adopting staff proved a detriment to some staff using the wikis. Additionally in the New Zealand education sector, wiki development processes, and the ethics associated with OER are not mainstream; and this affected the level of staff commitment, as well as funding agency recognition for using such platforms. When there is clear strategic direction in an educational organisation for OER, supported by recognition by funding bodies, this may help address some of these concerns.

==The relationship between Open Education Practices and Open Education Resources==
With social media and Internet derived disruptions, educational organisations need to develop capacity and critical awareness - if only to remain aware of the affordances and limitations. Working with OER can facilitate that capacity development by situating common practice into formats of digital information within socially organised media, under the principles of openness.

In general, open educational practice makes openness, community engagement, transparency, responsibility, sharing, and accountability central to educational practice. This includes but does not stop with the use of OER. It includes the production of OER, and that more transparency be developed across educational practices. Where OER focuses on content and resources, OEP represents the open practice of education. Where OER focuses largely on the questions of how resources can be made available, OEP asks the question of how openness can be practiced in an educational organisation. 

OER is often a repository of itemized resources (pictures, texts, websites, videos), OEPs focus on learning and assessment activities guided and informed by openness.

==A problem and its solution==
A few years ago, one of the teachers at Otago Polytechnic created a slide presentation using Microsoft PowerPoint using a template. There were lots of animation features and sound effects and there were several slides. As a result, the file was very large, and was difficult to use in an online learning context. Also the images used on the slides were taken from samples from Google image search results where copyright permissions were often not clearly stated. The source for each image was not referenced, nor was there any indication of the copyright associated with the images; nor was there any record of whether permission had been given to use the images. The slide presentation file had not been updated since being created by a teacher who no longer worked at the organisation. Consequently, it was being used by new teachers who were still adjusting to teaching the topic, and were unsure of the protocols surrounding organisational resources. The new teachers came to the Educational Development Centre and asked for assistance to redevelop the resource.

This example shows clearly how a resource, which initially took a lot of time and energy to create, quickly became redundant and unusable because the appropriate steps were not taken to provide a fully accessible, re-usable and portable resource, that is, one which could be classified as an OER. As a result of this kind of situation, several changes needed to be made.  There was a solution to the dilemma and the development process shown to the teachers is outlined.

Firstly, free software was used to create the presentation resource. It was important that the presentation be saved in a format that can be easily edited using freely accessible editing software, and free software generally uses open standard file formats, helping to ensure the file does not need one particular software platform to be edited. The use of open standard formats improved compatibility across a wider range of software, and increased accessibility for users who did not have access to Microsoft products. 

Secondly, some strategies for sourcing free-for-reuse images and other open educational resources were demonstrated and used, and the concepts of copyright permission and licensing were explored. The presentation ended up containing quality graphs and images that explicitly permitted reuse, and the original authors of these images were referenced. 

A third step was to share a range of strategies for reducing presentation file sizes, which enabled effective uses of the presentation slides in online settings. For example, the PDF process reduced the size of the file enabling it to be sent as an email attachment, or be located on a blog. 

A fourth step was to show the teachers how to access and utilise Internet publishing sites such as http://slideshare.net and http://wordpress.com that offer services which take an original file, process it for efficient online viewing, publish it and manage it within social media site. Because the presentation had been authored with free software and saved to an open standard format, it was a simple step to utilise these platforms. One of the spin offs from publishing a presentation on the social media platforms was that other teachers and experts more easily discovered the presentation and made use of it in their settings, or simply offered feedback. 

Lastly, the teachers learned how to subscribe to sources of educational media and to build their resource base.  Ultimately, they became absorbed in the social features of the publishing platforms, and their experiences interacting with other professionals helped them in their own work. This experience was translated into assignment activities for students, where they too learned how to engage social media as open learning environments.

This example represents the experiences of some teachers at Otago Polytechnic. Tentatively a few developed the confidence to use and contribute OER to social media channels. Examples of their work are evaluated in the chapter on Development. The networking opportunities and exposure afforded through this participation propose a more sustainable practice of professional development which more directly meets specific learning needs on an ongoing and as-needed basis.

==Strategic support==
The role of the polytechnic senior management cannot be understated in importance to these initial efforts. They permitted staff to explore and publish their works, they permitted staff to work outside the learning management system, and they defended this exploration against internal critics and reactionaries. In addition, they actively researched notions of Web 2.0 and networked teaching and learning and recognised the potential benefits and wider issues. Consequently, they developed an intellectual property policy that adopted the use of a Creative Commons Attribution license as a default position, sending a clear message of encouragement to staff to adopt open practices. This simple feature within the policy enables staff to retain the ability to protect IP or restrict copying and reuse where necessary, but through an encouragement for developing open educational resources.

There are several concepts associated with the OER movement which are closely linked to the Otago Polytechnic experience, and they are outlined in the following sections.

==Open Courseware and Open Educational Resources==
In 2002, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) began a project called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_OpenCourseWare MIT OpenCourseWare], with the aim being to gradually publish all educational resources and curricula with copyrights, and they made an announcement to:

::... invite educators around the world to draw upon the materials for their own curricula, and ... encourage all learners to use the materials for self-study. We hope the idea of openly sharing course materials will propagate throughout many institutions and create a global web of knowledge that will enhance the quality of learning and, therefore, the quality of life worldwide. [http://web.archive.org/web/20021014163054/ocw.mit.edu/index.html  Charles M. Vest, President, MIT, October 2002]

And so began the wider use of the term Open Courseware. The vision held by MIT did eventuate with many other educational organisations announcing Open Courseware projects. 

In July 2005, David Wiley developed the [http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/175 OpenCourseware Finder] - a search engine focused specifically on finding open courseware from a number of educational institutions, and later that year the establishment of the [http://www.ocwconsortium.org/ Open Courseware Consortium] - also based in Massachusetts.  Currently the Consortium has over 100 educational organisations from around the world publishing open courseware.

The hugely successful Wikipedia - currently ranking in the world's top 10 websites&lt;ref&gt;[[http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?ts_mode==global&amp;lang==none Alexa Top 500 Websites]. Retrieved 2012-11-21&lt;/ref&gt; - and easily the world's largest open educational resource had, by the time of the MIT invitation and the UNESCO announcement about OER, been operating for over 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wikipedia The History of Wikipedia]. Wikipedia.org. Retrieved 2012-11-21&lt;/ref&gt; In that time, Wikipedia grew from an initial 8,000 articles in January 2001 to 88,291 articles in the English version by October 2002. Today it has 251 language editions with the English version alone containing 1,778,031 articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Statistics Wikipedia statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home Wikimedia Foundation] was announced as an umbrella organisation that would encompass Wikipedia and the other open and collaborative authoring initiatives such as: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikiquote Wikiquote]; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikibooks Wikibooks] (including Wikijunior); [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikisource Wikisource]; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Commons Wikimedia Commons]; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikispecies Wikispecies]; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikinews Wikinews]; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikiversity Wikiversity]; and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-Wiki Meta-Wiki]. If these other wiki projects grow at anything like the rate at which Wikipedia is growing, the Wikimedia Foundation will easily house the world's largest reference and open educational resources.

There are several important differences between open courseware and open educational resources most clearly highlighted by a comparison between MIT OCW and Wiki Media Foundation projects. MIT's OCW comes with copyrights that restrict commercial use of their materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocw.mit.edu/terms/#cc MIT OCW Terms of Use Copyright]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also not simple or easy to adapt or modify MIT courseware from the place it is published, or in the formats it is published in. Open educational resources on the other hand - particularly those found on Wiki Media Foundation projects, do not restrict reuse through copyright, and the very platform used to publish and distribute these resources makes it possible for anyone to copy and adapt a resource.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:Licensing_policy Wiki Media Foundation Resolution: Licensing]&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, it is entirely possible for MIT OCW to copy and reuse anything found on WIki Media Foundation projects, but it is not possible for Wiki Media Foundation projects to copy MIT OCW content.

==Copyright==
[[Image:LicenseStats2005.jpg|frame|300px|Distribution of licenses in 2005 after Yahoo Indexed Creative Commons licensed works.]] 

The concept of openness is the most important outcome to eventuate from the proliferation of open educational resources.&lt;ref&gt;Kolowich, S. 2012. [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/11/08/educause-discussion-about-oer#ixzz2Bfr5F3N3 How 'Open' are MOOCs?]. ''Inside Higher Ed''. Retrieved 2012-11-21&lt;/ref&gt; They are resources which range from courses through to reference materials and multi media. Their openness in terms of visibility, access and initial use is obviously key, but to then give people the freedom to reuse, make derivatives from, or to redistribute the resources without restriction is critical to educational use. The copyright license that is assigned to a resource ultimately controls that use, and in some instances so does the format. 

The use of the Creative Commons Attribution license enables the most flexible and open sharing and re-use of resources. Non Commercial and No Derivative restrictions limit reuse, as does Share Alike. In 2007 Otago Polytechnic adopted a default Creative Commons Attribution license, which meant that resources created by staff could be freely used, distributed and modified provided attribution was given to the original authors. This approach was largely to remove any perceptions people might have had that would have limited the sharing and collaboration around resources. 

In the case of MIT's Open Courseware, the copyright license used on their resources is a Creative Commons license, with Share Alike and Non Commercial restrictions. These restrictions, in particular the Non Commercial restriction, have been criticised for the limits they place on the ability of others to remix, make improvements on, and to redistribute the resources. &lt;ref&gt;Möller, E. 2005. [http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/9/11/16331/0655 Creative Commons -NC Licenses Considered Harmful]. ''Kuro5hin''. Retrieved 2012-11-21&lt;/ref&gt; How can other institutions that are partly commercial and partly restricted in their own uses of resources, utilise or participate in open educational resource projects that come with Non Commercial restrictions?

The Free Cultural Works Definition was created&lt;ref&gt;http://freedomdefined.org/Definition&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to clarify copyright confusion around open educational resources, and to assist open educational projects make better choices in copyright licenses.

==Learning objects, re-usability and interoperability==

There are three key attributes required for an open educational resource: 1. Accessibility - ease of obtaining and using; 2. Re-usability - permissions and formats which enable others to use the resource, that is, portability; 3. Interoperability - enables exchange of information between different systems. For this to occur, the following must be considered:
# Accessibility is ensured by the prospect of open publishing. A resource that is published openly to the Internet can be considered accessible if it has meta data which evolves and updates according to its use. On the other hand, a resource that is delivered over the Internet, only accessible to those with a user name and password, and with meta data that is entered once and for various resourcing reasons, and is not maintained, eventually becomes inaccessible.
# Re-usability of an open educational resource is firstly ensured by a copyright license that uses limited, if any, restrictions, and secondly by its format. An educational resource with all copy rights reserved, and whose publisher has moved on, is rendered a difficult to use, or non re-usable resource. A resource with a Creative Commons Attribution license on the other hand will always remain a re-usable resource.
#[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability Interoperability] is one functional requirement that also affects re-usability, but is one in which neither the learning object (LO) nor the open educational resource has fully satisfied. 

Open and free educational resources appear to be replacing the development and distribution of learning objects. A number of learning object projects emerged as a result of an environment where, &quot; ...education and training markets [were] economically motivated to pursue global commerce opportunities involved in distributed learning over the Internet&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hamel &amp; Jones, 2002. [http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ijet/v3n1/hamel/ Designing Instruction with Learning Objects], p. 1. International Journal of Educational Technology. V3 N1. Retrieved 2012-11-21&lt;/ref&gt;.  As a result learning objects were developed for sharing within a philosophy of buying and selling. For example, [http://www.merlot.org/merlot/index.htm Merlot] located at California State University, and the Australian Flexible framework [http://toolboxes.flexiblelearning.net.au/index.htm Toolboxes]. 

It is worth noting that the functional requirements of learning objects tend to make their relevance questionable:
* Accessibility: the LO should be tagged with metadata so that it can be stored and referenced in a database.
* Re-usability: once created, a LO should function in different instructional contexts, however, the more generic the LO the less useful it becomes in different contexts.
* Interoperability: the LO should be independent of both the delivery media and knowledge management systems

In contrast to open educational resources, learning object development tends to focus on the production of resources that will work in learning management systems, and thus ignores the issue of accessibility, and the usefulness of the resources if they were made available outside a learning management system. Open educational resources on the other hand are made available outside learning management systems, which makes them accessible and useful in and outside a learning management system. Also the development of OER tends to focus on the use of free and open standard formats, making the resources more accessible and re-useable to people using free software designed to operate standardised formats. The rise in educational use of popular content repositories like Wikipedia and YouTube, and the improved understanding of blogs, wikis and the socially networked Internet, has lead many to question the relevance and integrity of the concept of learning objects &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downes.ca/files/audio/what_el2_means.mp3 Downes, 2005]; [http://www.jarche.com/node/584 Jache et al., 2005];  [http://incsub.org/blog/index.php?p==75 Farmer, 2004];[http://www.elearnspace.org/Articles/lms.htm  Seimens, 2004];  [http://jodi.ecs.soton.ac.uk/Articles/v03/i04/Polsani/ Polsani, 2003]; [http://web.archive.org/web/20041019162710/http://rclt.usu.edu/whitepapers/paradox.html  Wiley, 2001]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socially networked media==

For many, there is almost daily practice in the use of social media. For example, writing and answering emails, conversing through chat rooms and forums, publishing and watching videos and audio, and collaboratively editing documents and media which is simultaneously being stored and archived publicly for others to access, learn from and connect with. Informational and personal connections are being made through this social media, and all of it creates an impressive opportunity for learning. But as yet educational institutions struggle to define themselves within this social media age, often rejecting the idea of socially networked learning because it is regarded as unstructured, undisciplined and inferior to institutionalised learning. 

Socially networked media, also called Web 2.0 or social media, has an obvious relationship to contemporary learning theories and pedagogical practices influenced by social constructivism. This relationship becomes increasingly obvious as more and more educators gain practical experience and critical awareness of learning through social media. As early as 1971, Ivan Illich predicted the applicability of such networked learning when he wrote of ''learning webs'' in his seminal book Deschooling Society,&lt;ref&gt;Illich, I. 1971. [http://books.google.com.au/books/about/Deschooling_Society.html?id=ZBfp-3CqdcoC&amp;redir_esc=y Deschooling Society]. ''Calder &amp; Boyars''.&lt;/ref&gt; and he envisioned a society empowered through the use of peer to peer exchange of audio recordings on cassette tapes, facilitated by a community postal service. In the early years of the 1970s, Illich could have barely imagined the sharing of text, image, audio and video recordings we can enjoy today. If he were alive today, he would no-doubt be justifiably critical of it only being accessible to people in wealthy societies, and that too much of the Internet is predicated on technology that limits people's conviviality.&lt;ref&gt;Illich, I. 1976. [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=jbh_PwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Tools+for+Conviviality&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D7GsUMaHCoX-mAWvx4DIAw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA Tools for Conviviality]. ''Consortium Book Sales &amp; Dist, 1990''&lt;/ref&gt; But the successes of social media in the wealthy societies should be seen as the success of Illich's vision for learning webs as an educational paradigm. While the formats and delivery mechanisms may be different, the concept remains the same - give many people the ability to tell their own stories and ask their own questions to many other people, and powerful, socially constructed learning can emerge.

Meanwhile new educational institutions may be developing. The Wikimedia Foundation added Wikiversity to complement its suite of reference resources, and while it rapidly develops its technology, content and connections - with an average edit interval of 20 minutes as shown in its Recent Changes page,&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Special:Recentchanges Wikiversity Recent Changes] Retrieved May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the user group continues to discuss its relationship to educational institutions and credentialism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikiversity-l/2007-May/thread.html Wikiversity list archive, May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The Commonwealth of Learning established a similar project called Wikieducator, and has been proactively drawing in educational professionals and consultants to help with its positioning, forming the Open Educational Resources University in 2010, and offering the first assessed online course in 2012. These online communities of open educational practice are growing and it remains to be seen what will become of their efforts.

It could be that Illich's vision is already happening albeit through the use of sophisticated and still exclusive technology. With people empowered in the ability to connect and communicate with many others, perhaps new pathways to formally recognised learning will emerge from this social media and directly challenge those who will wait and see.

==Participatory culture==

When it comes to social media - participation is the key. Some people think that like learning objects, social media is another passing fad or worse, bringing amateurism to everything - including education.&lt;ref&gt;Keen, A. 2006. [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/006/714fjczq.asp Web 2.0
The second generation of the Internet has arrived. It's worse than you think.] ''The Weekly Standard'' 14 Feb, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of social media (Web 2.0) is explained  reasonably succinctly by Keats and Schmit (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Keats and Schmit. 2007. [http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue12_3/keats/index.html The Genesis and Emergence of Education 3.0 and its Potential for Africa]. ''First Monday Issue 12, Number 3''&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Over the past three-four years, a set of technologies and social phenomena have arisen on the Internet that are collectively referred to as Web 2.0 indicating that the World Wide Web has seen a set of important changes since its inception (version 1.0) which have turned it from an access technology into a participation technology.''

As described in the Rise of Participation Culture 2008 report:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsjb.com/RPC/ Rise of Participation Culture 2008 report]&lt;/ref&gt; 

:''This shift in internet use from passive to active is at the heart of their digital behavior and can be summed up in one word: participation. The mainstreaming of this participation culture is perfectly characterized by the [http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/148/report_display.asp Pew Internet and American Life Project] as &quot;Web is the New Normal.&quot;''

But what is it? Technically speaking it is the use of blogs; wikis; video, photo and audio sharing sites; forums, chats and even email, that combine into what more interestingly becomes socially constructed media. 

Michael Hotrum in Breaking the LMS wall:&lt;ref&gt;Hotrum, M. 2005. [http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/212/295 Breaking the LMS wall]. ''IRRODL March 2005''&lt;/ref&gt;

:''All in all it was just a brick in the wall. All in all it was all just bricks in the wall. (Pink Floyd, November 30, 1979)
:''The Internet is independent of device (hardware or platform), distance, and time, and is well-suited for open, flexible, and distributed learning. Yet traditional online, distributed learning methods are anything but flexible, open, or dynamic. What went wrong? Parkin (2004a, b) believes that we failed to appreciate that the Internet is a vehicle for connecting people with each other. We implemented LMS methods that imposed bureaucratic control, diminished learner empowerment, and delivered static information. “In a world hurtling toward distributed internetworking, e-learning was still based on a library-like central-repository concept.” Parkin suggests it is time to explore the true promise of e-learning, and to rework our ideas about how learning should be designed, delivered, and received. It is time to stop letting the LMS vendors tell us how to design learning. It is time to stop the tail from wagging the dog.''

With participatory culture arguably being the norm for a generation of people accustomed to socially networked media and online communication, then so called learner generated content will naturally develop. And this places educational institutions in a potentially hazardous predicament. What are the implications for an institution - or a course within an institution, when a large number of its students start blogging all that happens to them there, and start connecting with teachers and other learners outside the walls of their classroom, LMS or institution? Well, it's already happened, and Wikipedia and OER are just some of the results.

==Conclusion==
In this chapter some of the rationale behind that investment, has been outlined especially the evidence that open education and social media are growing trends in the education sector and society generally, therefore providing an argument for the need for educational institutions to engage and participate in OER. In the chapter on [[Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Open_education_development_and_evaluation|Development]] the reasons for making that investment, including the detailing of several models of education are presented and includes an analysis of the return (ROI) in terms of traditional objectives and financial return. How the investment was actioned is also detailed.

In 2008, educational development work at Otago Polytechnic was at the fore of international efforts for Open Education. 

Progress included: 
* significant development work on the Wikieducator platform; 
* use of popular and internationally recognised media and communication platforms; 
* development of an Intellectual Property Policy in line with open educational practices; 
* adoption of a NZ Creative Commons Attribution copyright license and; 
* spokespeople who were part of the dialogue on educational media and communications nationally. 

At the time, Otago Polytechnic featured several times in international news: 
* twice on Creative Commons International; 
* once on Creative Commons Australia, 
* twice with the Commonwealth of Learning, 
* numerous times in educational journals and quite a few weblogs. 

The signing of the Capetown Declaration was an event that recognised this work, involving the Chief Executive Phil Kerr, symbolically confirming the commitment of Otago Polytechnic's senior management to Open Education; and being the first New Zealand organisation to sign the Declaration. This confirmed that Otago Polytechnic aimed to play a role in leading New Zealand towards progressive educational practices.</text>

:'''Robin Day''', Deputy CEO: &quot;So the vision is to make Otago Polytechnic a key and a lead provider in this area both in New Zealand and world wide.... The recognition of Creative Commons with Attribution as our default position has been widely accepted and feedback has been that it is instrumental in building Otago Polytechnic's reputation as an educational provider.&quot;

:'''Sarah Gauthier''', Liaison Officer Marketing and Communications: &quot;I'm aware that people in EDC are doing a lot of fantastic and innovative work, around getting people to work more collaboratively in the online format, both in teaching and learning, and maybe by bringing our materials to a wider audience. So rather than keeping it all closed up in an institution where information can only be found in books, we're putting information online, where many people can see, where people can interact with it in a different way.... You have this whole big world, out there, with little people living in columns, not knowing what the other one is doing. What I think open educational resources can do is connect those people, so that not only are they interacting, but they're learning, so their information actually goes up.&quot;

:'''Anna Hughes''', lecturer: &quot;I think open education is a great thing, it would be fantastic if more tertiary institutions - or any institution, embraced that open education policy. I think that Otago Polytechnic should be doing it, and should lead the way.... I think my vision would be that there is as much as possible out there in an open access forum, and that its available to as many people as possible around the world.&quot; 

:'''Phil Kerr''', CEO: &quot;As an institution, we've embraced the concept of OER (Open Educational Resources) as a way of operating, that's manifested in our IP Policy, and our Copyright Policy, and we've started a journey that we think will be long term benefit not only to the Polytech, but to the sector, and education generally.... It's very easy to say why should we hide the content that we generate, let's make it freely available, let's encourage people to use it and put back in the pot so-to-speak, and I think everyone ends up better off with a philosophy of that nature.&quot;

:'''William Lucas''', Lecturer: &quot;I have a real problem with the whole issue of intellectual property, its crazy and restrictive, I mean its not as if you're giving something material away and that you lose being giving something of your resources. If you share your intellectual property you haven't lost anything.... I'll create the stuff and leave it lying around, and later I'll see other people using it - that's fine ... its the way it should be!&quot;

:'''David McQuillan''', Programme Coordinator (Massage Therapy): &quot;I think that what people pay for is not just the content of the knowledge, they pay for someone who can guide them through it.... There's a huge learning curve with teaching online. Last year was our first year, and I'd say some things went really well, and other things we can improve on. If we look how the students have achieved through the year, we've decided that over-all they've performed better that the students in the previous year, there are some areas where their learning is more and where it is less, but over-all we're pretty happy with the outcome.... If we can persuade others who are in the same field, to become involved in open educational resources and development and collaboration, then that would be better for everyone really.&quot;

:'''Samuel Mann''', lecturer: &quot; ...what's changed in the last couple of years is that we've had a complete turn around in the approach to the accessibility of information ... now the emphasis is on, let's get this stuff out there! It really is an exciting thing.... The straight knowledge isn't our core business, our core business is facilitating people to understand that knowledge or to work with that knowledge.&quot; 

:'''Terry Marler''', Team Leader at the Educational Development Centre: &quot;It's not just a giving, its a receiving as well. Of all kinds of personal connections, and understanding how resources could be customised and used in developing countries ... the other interesting thing is that, wherever I have gone, people say to me - 'Otago Polytechnic, we know all about your efforts.' Because of the work we do on Wikieducator we are well known for our work, and it is appreciated. It's like a door opens wherever I go because of this work.&quot;

:'''Kyla Russell''', Kaitohutohu CEO: &quot;The purpose of open educational resources is access to resources without having to reinvent a wheel, and the realisation that just by providing access, doesn't necessarily grant the qualification - it provides access to learning ... if people can come to learn to use it as a resource, then the greatest reason we can have is the concept of Ako - to teach is to learn. And so in teaching someone else you learn a lot about yourself, and learning from someone else you can pass on a new way of teaching. And so for me that's what it provides - not just as a resource, but how we use it - you know, engaging with it and using it as a tool rather than a nuisance.&quot;

:'''Jean Tillyshort''', Group Manager for Central Otago: &quot;We've had really good feedback about our policy for open education, and our open resources, and being proactive about that, and we've actually had really good feedback about particular resources we've put on the Net and made available as well.&quot;

:'''Mike Waddell''', General Manager Marketing: &quot;If I want to find out - through open education, how to peel an onion, I can find that out 70 thousand-probable ways by purely doing a search on the Internet. So why shouldn't then someone find out how to peel an onion at Otago Polytechnic? 

:'''Ryan Ward''', Co-president of the Student Association: &quot;New Zealand may not be ready for free education, but it's definitely something we can work towards, and the reduction of those barriers - specifically the financial ones. Thousands of educational resources are freely available online, for collaboration, easier access, improved teaching and learning outcomes.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Otago Polytechnic Admin.jpg|thumb|300px|Entrance to the Otago Polytechnic]]
Here we will look at the pioneering work of Otago Polytechnic, who in 2007 established a progressive policy around intellectual property that prepared it for the open educational practices that would follow. In 2010, staff at the University of Canberra took Otago's initial work and prepared a proposal for that university's review of IP. This chapter tells these stories, and outlines the key points of these policies as being better able to carefully manage IP, to be more realistic in claims of IP ownership, and to recognise autonomy on the idea of intellectual property for indigenous cultures.

==Otago Polytechnic's IP Policy==
In 2007 Otago Polytechnic instituted an intellectual property policy that vesting ownership of intellectual property (IP) in the creators, while promoting the use of free copyrights and open development through the preferred use of [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/ the NZ Creative Commons Attribution] copyright license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikieducator.org/Otago_Polytechnic/Intellectual_property Otago Polytechnic's Intellectual Property Policy]&lt;/ref&gt; The CC By NZ license allows others to copy, distribute, transmit and adapt the work as long as credit is given to the original author. Because this license won’t suit all circumstances, there’s provision in the Polytechnic's IP Policy for negotiation exceptions to the CC By NZ default.

To ensure the values of New Zealand’s Maori are protected, and to accommodate a different concept of ownership, a Maori IP policy was developed in consultation with the local Maori Ngai Tahu law office.  Broadly speaking, the Polytechnic’s role in this area is one of guardianship of Maori IP and knowledge. The concept of guardianship has also been extended to students’ IP.

==Deputy Chief Executive of Otago Polytechnic==
[[image:Robin Day.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Dr Robin Day, Deputy Chief Executive. &quot;''The new IP Policy reflects our preference for open sharing of information, knowledge and resources'''. Image courtesy of Otago Polytechnic]]

Deputy Chief Executive, Dr Robin Day, tells the story of the evolution of the policy.   

:''For a long time the Polytechnic had no formal policy on IP and, when the Executive saw the need to fill this gap, they initially sought legal expertise to help draw up a framework to put out for consultation.  According to this initial and very different framework, Otago Polytechnic owned copyright of material developed at the institution.  The reaction was vociferous with some staff saying, &quot;You’re not owning my thinking! If that’s the case, I’ll do what’s required for my job and do my really creative thinking at home!&quot;  Some students also protested, saying they would do what was required to get a qualification, but would keep their best work to themselves so they would be able to set up their own companies to develop their ideas after they finished study. From an educational perspective it seemed that the policy of taking ownership of people’s intellectual property could constrain learning, knowledge development and good will.''

:''Over two years of debate, much of the input came from those with a high stake in IP – the Art, Design and IT Schools who are the main creators in the institution.  Phil Ker (the Chief Executive) and myself engaged with those who were interested, going to meetings and involving staff with the drafting and redrafting of the policy.  Contributions came from right across the spectrum, from those wanting full copyright through to those who wanted to share material, to those who argued for freedom and more accessible learning, and a more open society. The Executive of Otago Polytechnic comprises people whose core experience and qualifications are in education. The new IP Policy reflects their &quot;preference for the open sharing of information, knowledge and resources&quot; and is in harmony with the Polytechnic’s philosophy of looking at learning from the learner's perspective and initiatives such as recognition of prior learning.''

:''Ensuring everybody is aware of the policy and that other policies, strategies and action plans are all aligned, is an enormous job and a long process. Despite attempts to inform and involve everyone in the process, for some people copyright and IP only surfaces when it impinges on them.  In these cases, the negotiation process is still available on a case-by-case basis.  Research and ethical concerns, for example, often need careful treatment. Enquirers are directed to the policy before options are discussed and, where appropriate, contracts are set up to specify conditions of ownership and copyright at the outset of a project.''

:''Many staff express the fear that people will no longer enroll in courses if their teaching material is freely available, but others point out that so much is already freely available and that most students want a qualification which requires assessment not content. Open Educational Resources are a way of attracting people to the Polytechnic, because they can see the sort of material we use, and they can orientate themselves to the courses before they start. The Internet provides a forum where we can build the reputation of our institution and it's engagement with the community and with businesses.  Rather than dissuading people from coming, our resources can provide subtle marketing and understanding, where people can see our work and decide if they want to come to us.''

==Marketing courses==
Hillary Jenkins runs the Travel and Tourism Diploma at Otago Polytechnic. She found that by providing easy and unrestricted access to the online materials help with marketing during open days and in schools. Robin Day also acknowledged the advantages of the open licence in a similar way: &quot;It enables us now to engage more freely in different ways of teaching and learning through the Internet, such as on wikis, blogs, YouTube, Facebook.&quot; 

==Research outputs==
The same is true about research, because there is a lot of emphasis in New Zealand on research in tertiary education institutions, the IP Policy held by Otago Polytechnic could potentially impact on publication. Robin believed that publishing papers was like working with external clients, and said: &quot;We have to walk in different worlds.  If it’s our stuff, we’ve got the Creative Commons Attribution license over it, that’s our default.  With external publishers, if necessary we’ll accept their copyright restrictions, although if we’re able to negotiate, we will.&quot;  He pointed out that there are now databases and journals moving into the Creative Commons licensing regime: &quot;The drivers must be changing as the open journals become more credible. Others probably realise they will end up losing business if they don’t adopt the open business model as well.&quot; 

The IP policy enables Polytechnic staff to publish and disseminate research findings freely without compromising their intellectual property rights. For example, Leigh Blackall, from the The Educational Development Centre publishes on a variety of open platforms, such as WikiBooks, blogs and Youtube. Bronwyn Hegarty, an educational developer who works with Leigh, has collaborated on several New Zealand government funded projects where open licensing was important so others in the tertiary sector could access and reuse the outputs.  

==NZ Government directions==
Robin believes the policy fits with NZ Government’s desire to encourage technology transfer between the marketplace and the tertiary sector. He stated: &quot;This IP policy removes barriers to that.  Our graduates take their IP with them into the marketplace. If they want to develop it, we’re more than happy to work with them, and they often come back and work with us. Our industrial prototyping design facility now has about 60 businesses coming in and out of it. They know their IP is protected. They want to use our equipment, our staff, and technical skills and blend it with what they’re doing. They’re paying, so that’s a benefit for us, but the huge benefit is our reputation as the key leader in this development in this region.&quot; The intellectual property conditions at Otago Polytechnic are also attracting some people from universities to engage in research with Otago Polytechnic which engages in research and scholarly activity, and has Performance Based Research Funding.  Robin explained, &quot;Some people are saying, I like this working environment.  It’s less structured.  It’s more open. We’ve had people who've said they like working here because the research conditions are actually better. That’s cool.&quot;

==Partnering Wiki Media Foundation projects==
The Polytechnic isn't leaping willy-nilly into whatever web platform is available either. There is evaluation and discussion about suitability and reliability.  Wikibooks is one of the platforms recommended because it’s very strong and it’s building and growing. While some people still have concerns, many like the fact that it is an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation, that it’s a not-for-profit organization, and it has higher ideals.

In 2010, Staff in the Faculty of Health at the University of Canberra took advantage of their university's IP Policy review period, and developed an IP policy proposal that built on the initial work done at Otago Polytechnic&lt;ref&gt;UC authors. [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/University_of_Canberra/Proposed_policy_on_intellectual_property Proposed Policy for Intellectual Property at the University of Canberra]. September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

Key points included:
* Staff and student retaining ownership of their IP
* Creative Commons Attribution as the default license of the University platform
* Opt out option for staff and students needing to restrict copyrights
* Indigenous autonomy

Proponents of the proposed policy were invited to speak at the Annual General Meeting of Knowledge Commercialisation Australasia, and test the points in their proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Blackall, L and Neill, J. 2010. [Open education and research at the University of Canberra http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Open_education_and_research_at_the_University_of_Canberra]. ''Wikiversity''. Retrieved 2012-11-22&lt;/ref&gt; They felt that they had confirmed value in their proposal, especially that defaulting to Creative Commons Attribution with an opt-out process would improve the management of IP over all, and better target resources to those that needed IP management services; that recognising and valuing individual ownership of IP was a more realistic approach and one that would foster good will within the University; and that recognition of Indigenous autonomy around IP was a significant step of reconciliation with Indigenous cultures everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Blackall, L. 2010. [http://www.leighblackall.com/2010/11/why-kca-need-to-change-their-name.html Why KCA Need to Change Their Name]. ''leighblackall.com''. Retrieved 2012-11-22&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal did not receive recognition or a formal response from the University of Canberra. Others did respond however, including the National Tertiary Education Union calling the proposed policy a possible benchmark in IP management in the Australian university sector. &lt;ref&gt;Kwok, J. [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Talk:University_of_Canberra/Proposed_policy_on_intellectual_property#NTEU_Response NTEU Response to UC Proposed IP Policy]. 27 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==How Creative Commons and open access improves IP management==
Setting an organisation's copyright procedures to Creative Commons Attribution, promoting open academic practices, and retaining individual ownership, drives better management of Intellectual Property in that organisation. (Blackall, 2010)
 
A CC By and open access default requires those who wish to restrict their copyright and access, to make that known to their IP management office early in their projects timeline. This results in an early intervention and best possible management of IP at the outset, helping to ensure copyright diligence from the outset. This intervention would lead to more efficient and targeted services from the IP management office, such as education, commercialisation, or a variety of restriction management and protections.&lt;ref&gt;Blackall, L. 2010 [http://leighblackall.blogspot.com/2010/11/giving-brief-talk-at-parliament-house.html Presentation to auPSI]. ''leighblackall.com''. Retrieved 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Setting CC By and open access as a default position ensures that academic work that can go open, does. The minority of work that requires restriction gets the best possible IP management early. 

Many IP managers in educational organisations express frustrations at being brought into a project too late, leading to complex and time consuming work, unraveling years of messy IP management before they can get the project into a position to capitalise on the reasons for restricting and protecting the IP in the first place. Those organisations make a general claim of ownership over all IP being generated in the organisation - believing it to be the best way to manage and contain IP, but the messy reality exposes such attempts to catch all work in restricted and protected status as unrealistic and counter productive. 

Setting policy such as this ignores the messy realities of education and research. New and visiting academics will bring prior work and new professional networks without necessarily signing over IP, or clarifying ownership. Most will likely ignore IP complications day to day, preferring to get on with the primary work instead. Importantly, draconian policy risks driving poor practices away from better management, and can too easily generate bad will with those involved, resulting in disputes when academics leaving believe it their right to take their work with them. An organisation claiming over-all ownership fixes none of these realities. 

Retaining individual ownership, on the other hand, promotes good will and a fairer relationship between academics and their host university, and can improve motivation and a sense of ownership and responsibility on projects. Setting CC By and open access as the default position helps the university to capitalise on the majority of work being generated. A process for opting out of the CC By/open access default initiates early interventions with the IP Office, and helps that Office to efficiently focus on that minority of work, and to offer better services for IP education and management.

In this chapter we will look at models for open education practice. Included are the philosophies underpinning them, and the costs and benefits assumed. 

==Open Educational Resources==

How are people who are engaged in using OER material go about finding it?  

It might be helpful to split “OER” into two over simplistic categories: 
# Institution focused, 
# Everyone else.

''Institutionally focused'' OER look for packaged content like whole courses, whole text books, instructionally designed materials, etc. These are typically found in “Learning Object Repositories” like Merlot and Connexions, or in MIT Open Courseware, and IvyLeague MOOCs.

''Everyone else'' focuses on more granular resources like images, videos, audio recordings, texts, web pages, etc. They typically use Google search, Creative Commons search, Open Journals, Open Standard Formats, Open Source Software, hardware and products

'''What are emerging as the engagement strategies of choice in the OER space? '''
 
''For Institutions'', IvyLeague MOOCs, and the platforms they promote (iTunesU, Coursera, MITOCW, etc)

''For everyone else'', The free University movement (such as Melbourne Free University, or Peer 2 Peer University), Wikimedia Commons (Wikipedia, Wikibooks, Wikiversity), Flickr Creative Commons, Youtube Creative Commons, Vimeo CC, Archive.org, Ubuntu/GNU Linux, Firefox, Chrome, Android

'''Do specific subject areas have specific OER databases that have become well established?'''

''Institutions:'' Yes. Johns Hopkins for example, have a number of Health related Open Courseware; then many of the more central repositories have categories and taxonomies. Some have Folksonomies, such as Wikimedia Commons’ Category system

''Everyone else:'' Yes. Mostly folksonomies centering around the big Wiki projects, but also Youtube Education (Where CC licenses are applied) CCLearn, Peer 2 Peer University, Wikiversity, School of Everything, Melbourne Free University, etc etc

'''Have particular OER search engines proven to be popular? ''' 

Many are not strictly search engines, but because they have become so huge, the search function on large repositories are effective search engines
* Google’s Advance Search
* Wikipedia and then the related projects like Wikimedia Commons
* Youtube
* Creative Commons Search
* NLA Trove (though not strictly OER, projects like these have many resources that meet the requirements)

'''Have particular searching strategies through Google proven to be effective?'''
 
* Not much beyond basic and advanced search. Google’s advanced search finds many “OER” but on closer inspection are not strictly OER. It is too often the case that people have licensed something CC By and it turns out they have not cleared all third party rights, and so it can't be used as OER.

At Otago Polytechnic, many staff use external web services to source and develop open educational resources and practices.

By using external web services such as these, the work of Otago Polytechnic is accessed and used far and wide. Most importantly, staff and students are able to develop a wider array of Internet related skills and increase their confidence in using digital approaches, as well as connect more readily to a variety of content, other learners and opportunities for forming professional partnerships.

==Open Courses==
In 2008 staff at Otago Polytechnic developed models for open access courses. Examples include:

* [http://wikieducator.org/Travel_and_Tourism Travel and Tourism]
* [http://wikieducator.org/HIVAIDS Nursing HIV/AIDS]
* [http://wikieducator.org/Otago_Polytechnic Many more]

As the features of wiki platforms evolve, the design of the course structure also tends to change. A structure based on activities and resources has been trialled with programmes, such as, [http://wikieducator.org/Travel_and_Tourism Travel and Tourism] and [http://wikieducator.org/Horticulture Horticulture]. Other courses, for example, [http://wikieducator.org/Flexible_Learning_Guidebook Flexible Learning] and [http://wikieducator.org/Facilitating_Online Facilitating Online] have made use of the navigation and pedagogical templates created for WikiEducator. In the case of [http://wikieducator.org/HIVAIDS HIVAIDS] for nursing, a book-like structure was used with a &quot;page&quot; for each topic. 

==Development structures for educational wikis ==
Several different structures in use for wiki-based educational materials and courses are described in this section. The structure chosen depends on the &quot;look and feel&quot; required for the materials, and the preference for navigation through the course and the information. For example, tabbing on a navigation bar may make it easier to see all the topics at a glance, or scrolling through information may be chosen over chunking. Read on to discover some of the options.

===Reusable wiki course structure===
[[Image:Reusable wiki courses.png|right]]
This model of using a wiki for developing course outlines, learning activities and resource libraries was designed to make the work as reusable and open for collaboration as possible. It is based on the belief that a common document structure is what helps Wikipedia succeed, and that if such a structure was developed for educational resources, collaboration could be maximised. This model was inspired by [http://networklearning.blogspot.com/2007/04/importance-of-activity-sheets-glue-that.html Steven Parker], and his ideas about activity sheets in 2007, and cautioned by David Wiley's significant 2001 paper [http://web.archive.org/web/20041019162710/http://rclt.usu.edu/whitepapers/paradox.html The Reusability Paradox]. It remains to be seen if this structure is simple enough for teachers to implement. Vocational training which revolves around Assessment Unit standards and learning objectives, lends itself to the logic of this model, however, the skills shortage in the use of MediaWikis may hamper progress.

The structure revolves around the creation of ''Learning Objective Pages''. These pages list a set of learning objectives related to a particular skill or knowledge attribute. Two sub pages attach to the ''Learning Objective'' pages: 
# ''Library of Resources'' - as developers and support librarians encounter information and media relating to the learning objectives, they add links to this page.
# ''Learning Activities'' - as learning activities are devised, they are added to a list on this page.

''Course Outline'' pages are developed separately, but are what bring a selection of ''Learning Objective'' pages and their ''Libraries'' and ''Activities'' together. 

The ''Course Outline'' pages are free to be contextualised to whatever the expressive needs of the course may be. For this reason, it is important that the ''Learning Objective'' pages are worded in such a way so as to be as reusable in as many different contexts as possible, and to leave contextualisation to the ''Course Page'' or to the various ''Activities'' listed under the ''Learning Objective'' page.

===Navigation and pedagogical templates===
When a navigation template is used in [http://wikieducator.org/Main_Page WikiEducator], for example, a traditional web page navigation is provided which portrays all the topics and pages horizontally along the top of the wiki page. Users can also see the navigation template on each page making it easy to move between topics. Another template which is increasingly being used is the [http://wikieducator.org/Template:ProjectNav Project Navigation template] which enables a professional looking homepage to be created. Both [http://wikieducator.org/Flexible_Learning_Guidebook Flexible Learning] and [http://wikieducator.org/Facilitating_Online Facilitating Online] use these templates.

Pedagogical templates are also increasingly being used to organise information, resources and activities in courses which use WikiEducator, and these provide structure as well as consistency for the appearance of the pages. The templates can easily be customised to suit the subject material and the preferences of the users.  Learning to use the templates and create them requires some training, but is relatively easy to master once shown, or by following the tutorials about [http://wikieducator.org/Help:Navigation_templates navigation templates] and [http://wikieducator.org/Quickstart_guide/pedagogical_templates pedagogical templates] on WikiEducator.

===eBook template===
The organisation of topics and content into a eBook has also been used. The advantage of this is a clean and uncluttered front page for the course, and a list of contents which links to the pages in the book. This approach was used for the [http://wikieducator.org/HIVAIDS HIV/AIDS] for Nursing course development. The [http://wikieducator.org/Blogging_Handbook Blogging Handbook] also uses an eBook approach with short chunks of content alongside a list of topics. It is easy to see at a glance what is covered in the book, and the way the pages are organised provides the feeling of a small handbook. The templates for eBook sites like this are more fussy to create, and not as easy to modify, if not an advanced wiki user. The concept of an open textbook is covered in the next section.

==The open textbook==
[[Image:ScreenHunter 02 Jan. 13 11.59.gif|thumb|300px|left|A screengrab of Otago Polytechnic's Vet Nursing textbook on Wikibooks: [[Anatomy and Physiology of Animals]]]]
[[Image:ScreenHunter 03 Jan. 13 11.59.gif|thumb|300px|A screen grab of the same textbook after desktop publishing, and loading to print on demand service [http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/anatomy-and-physiology-of-animals/2285614 Lulu.com]]]

In 2008, developers at the Otago Polytechnic Educational Development Centre (EDC) designed a process for the production, publication and distribution of textbooks written by staff. Otago Polytechnic lecturer, Ruth Lawson was the first to use this process, and tested the approach with her [[Anatomy and Physiology of Animals]] textbook.

Anatomy and Physiology of Animals is a 269, A4 page textbook, which is authored, edited and updated on Wikibooks.  As it is needed, a reformatted version is taken from the wiki, and uploaded for printing, binding and postal delivery via the http://lulu.com web service. The Wikibook acts as a freely accessible digital version of the text, as well as enabling collaborative editing and student contributions. A stable version of the book is taken from the wiki, and offered on the Lulu website in a printed and perfect bound format for US$24 a copy. The printed version is always up to date and available on demand - that is, one order, one print, with ordering and postage handled by the Lulu service. Otago Polytechnic no longer has to commit to a print run of hundreds to achieve production cost savings, and no longer has to rely on poor quality, spiral-bound photocopied versions which used to sell at the same price.

Despite the availability of the free digital version, and despite the openness of the wiki and the relatively unrestricted copyrights over the book, almost all the students in Otago Polytechnic veterinary nursing courses where the book is used, choose to buy a printed Lulu book; this returns a royalty payment to the Veterinary Nursing Department each year to not only help to sustain the process but also provides a profit. A vision for the developers was to have students help update and edit the Wikibook each year, because by contributing to the new Lulu version they were theoretically creating a revised textbook for the next intake of students which doubled as a yearbook for the graduates to keep. Sales of the printed version of the textbook were more likely to remain steady as long as the price of the Lulu version remained below the cost of making a bootleg version with a photocopier. 

Therefore, a textbook publishing model was created which does not rely on a publisher, exorbitant costs and printing runs, or copyright protectionism. It provides an author, or their employer with a royalty payment per sale, and ensures access and reusability to teachers and students without legal implications. Through the use of a platform such as Wikibooks, the model offers students an opportunity to increase their engagement with the text, and customise printed versions appropriate to their needs and means, which in-turn helps to sustain sales. Originally, the idea of an open textbook was considered economic suicide, however, this has proven to be the exact opposite. Another model for open learning which has been tested at Otago Polytechnic is the concept of informal learning, and this is discussed alongside the financial costs of formal learning.

== Formal and informal learning ==
[[Image:Cogdog-1635297552.jpg|thumb|500px|A lesson I learned from a mentor a long time ago is that as a facilitator, an organizer, our prime role is nothing more than to create a reaosns for people to come together. Once they are there, great things can happen.]]

The [http://wikieducator.org/Facilitating_Online Facilitating Online] course was the first one to be used to test the concept of informal learning, that is, open participation without the need to enroll. Historically, the course was named Facilitating Online Learning Communities and started life in a closed Learning Management System with a brief to teach teachers how to use online discussion boards, email and web conferencing to facilitate online learning. As part of this iteration of the course, participants were introduced to the concept of online communities and shown how some worked, but were not actively able to participate in any; the primary online community was the classroom experience. 

This model precluded informal participation by others who were not enrolled, and restricted interaction for these informal participants to the members of the formal class and vice versa. For a course about online communities, this was potentially a death knell because the social networking opportunities of the world wide web were off limits to the participants, and they were missing out on a rich and exciting experience. Therefore, in 2007, lecturers at Otago Polytechnic's Education Development Centre decided to re-develop the course to include wider ranging platforms where online facilitation skills could be used in more meaningful ways. For example, environments such as wikis, email groups, blogging networks, and a range of social networking sites and online communities including virtual worlds were included. When the lecturers started introducing this content, they started making the course materials and communication open access, believing experiential and immersive learning would be the most effective way to support learning about online facilitation. Eventually the course used entirely open platforms, and largely ignored LMS platforms, however, features, such as forums, that popular platforms had in common with Learning Management Systems were discussed.

In 2008, the course was fully open access, with the course schedule and content available on WikiEducator. The communication strategies used in the course occurred through the use of a course blog, a group email forum and regular live web conferencing sessions. Participants were exposed to a wide range of online communities and participated in them, for example, a collaborative barn building exercise was done on a wiki, participants took part in a tour of Second Life, and all participants were required to set up and maintain a blog for the duration of the course.  

The facilitators promoted the course internationally, inviting open participation without the need to enroll in the course. Formal enrollment was explained as something people could do if they needed learning support, assessment and certification. The intention of opening course participation to more people was so the informal participants would help enrich the experiential and immersive learning experiences for the formal students, as well as potentially being able to recruit more formal enrollments. A total of 89 people from 19 countries participated in the first open course, seven times the average number of people in previous occurrences of the course. Nine people formally enrolled in the course at the beginning, so the facilitators administered the course by separating the participants into formal and informal groups. The nine formally enrolled participants were given priority learning support, including phone calls, email, and face-to-face contact if they were local as well as regular communication and feedback on blog posts. The 80 informal participants could join in group activities and web conference events, access content, recordings and transcripts, and submit assignments, but they did not receive priority learning support, assessment or certification. Many of the participants assisted with facilitation activities, providing valuable feedback on the blogs of the formally enrolled participants. Four informal participants requested Certificates of Attendance to help with possible later assessment via a Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) service. 

This model can be extended further so that international students can participate and seek RPL assessment after the course - thereby avoiding hefty up-front enrollment fees. Local students can also take advantage of the enrollment flexibility by not enrolling until they are confident of a pass, thereby avoiding transcript records showing non-completion. The traditional up-front enrollment remains an option for those who need intensive learning support, formative assessment, and quick certification. In the current climate of course funding and administration, the course does not run until the minimum number of people have enrolled up-front. When this process secures sufficient funds to contract a facilitator, then the course is made open access for others. 

As long as the participants who enrol up-front appreciate the priority service they receive, and the increased numbers help improve the learning experience, there is no problem with using the open access model. This approach has also been extended to other courses offered by Otago Polytechnic, but it does require significant investment in facilitator training, and in making sure administrators and marketing personnel understand the model.

==Open access learning==
[[Image:Heiwa4126-2189577694.jpg|thumb|500px]]

A model of open access learning has arisen to cater for the people who have requested activities and experiences which are immediately seen as relevant and can be applied in practical ways to the area of business.  This change occurred following a meeting in October 2008, between the Otago Polytechnic School of Applied Business and stakeholders - business and community spokespeople and other interested people - who gathered to discuss the future of the School and its services. On that day, several ideas were explored in discussion leading to a change of emphasis for the School qualifications, so that potential students would find out upfront what they could learn, and how it could be applied in the real world of business. The following scenario outlines the stages of this open access model:

;Certificates, Diplomas and Degrees to the back
If qualifications per se are to become less prominent in the learning experience, the norm regarding what it means to get a formal education has to be inverted. The “certificate, diploma and degree” aspect of education, has to be put to the back, and the content and learning activities brought to the front. This suggestion is in response to feedback from students who said they want to know what is actually ''in'' the course, what they will learn, how applied it is going to be, and the relevance for their career. When potential students are sent information about the available qualifications (certificates, diplomas and degrees) there is no clear indication given about these aspects of interest to students.  Additionally, the formal structure of the qualifications limit educational development for learning which is authentic for the industry.

Hillary Jenkins, the programme manager for one of the qualifications, the Diploma in Applied Travel and Tourism, in the School of Applied Business  – otherwise known as [http://wikieducator.org/Travel_and_Tourism Travel and Tourism] - is “inverting” the  programme so it envelops a wide range of interests in learning.  She has started with one of the courses: Planning for Small Business.

The planning for the change, began with finding out what else was going on in Dunedin, Otago, in terms of courses and support for people planning for setting up small businesses. A meeting with interest groups such as the Chamber of Commerce, NZ Trade and Enterprise, the local business incubator Kick Start, and a number of Polytechnic lecturers, community educators, and private training providers was held to assess the level of interest.  The idea was received well because it would not be in competition, and was likely to be highly complimentary to existing services. The decision was made to develop a unique approach to planning for small business by including sustainable business models.

The course is based on a text book especially created for the course, and includes learning activities and assessment leading to the completion of a business plan. The course developers negotiated with NZ Trade and Enterprise to obtain copyrights to make a derivative of their already excellent business plan guide ''Planning for Success''. This guide is a template for preparing a business plan, and has supporting information attached to it. Hillary and her team wanted to make a derivative from the guide, that would incorporate triple bottom line accounting as well as sustainability information. To compliment the textbook information, they host and record seminars and presentations, and run short workshops to assist people in preparing their business plans. The derivative text, developed on Wikibooks, is called [[Sustainable Business]]; and a calendar of events and workshops to compliment it is under development in Otago.

;Enveloped learning
While the textbook provides the structure for the Planning for Small Business course, the calendar of events and workshops enables the participants to enter the real world real business. Practical sessions include seminars provided by the Inland Revenue Department on a variety of topics, for example, business registration and tax and levies. There are also presentations from different insurance brokers, presentations from local business people, workshops from local services, and other activities. A range of short, 30 minute to 1 hour events, with direct relevance to planning for a sustainable small business are open to the public and enrolled students alike. These short events link to slightly longer events, such as: a three hour workshop in spreadsheets; a 1/2 day tour of an existing business; a consultation period with a service; and a business plan writing workshop held over five evenings. Attendance at both the short and more involved events, can be credited towards the formal course in Planning for Small Business, and this option has the potential to attract wider interest in the course over all.

;Examples: 
Imagine someone in the community who already has full time job, and is interested in developing a small business idea. When this person is given access to the short events, and the relevant parts of the textbook, they are not only getting the information and activity they need at the time, they are also contributing to the experience of other participants. When this type of open access approach is made available to members of the business community it becomes a marketing opportunity for the organisation running the open access course, e.g., Otago Polytechnic, and enhances the experience of formally enrolled participants. It is akin to the  open lecture approach, except it is experiential, and the course participants are able to engage in activities alongside business owners. When enrolled students (which in Hillary’s course tends to be school leavers) attend informative events as part of the course learning activities, for example, Writing a Business Plan workshop, they are exposed to the perspectives of the wider public who are also attending. From the perspective of the course coordinator, open access attracts more diverse participation at a higher level of activity than would otherwise be possible.  There is no commitment or enrollment to a certificate, diploma or degree required when participating in the open access events and activities, instead, short, one off, and regularly available workshops and seminars which are designed to assist people with an interest in small business are promoted.

;Making our way to optional certificates, diplomas and degrees
[[Image:Foundphotoslj-1133303891.jpg|thumb|500px]]
The open access approach is designed to envelop many different levels of interest in the learning process, and optionally progresses people towards a credential if this is the pathway they choose. When people engage informally (non-enrolled) in the open access events and activities, if their attendance and completion of the workshops and events is recorded, this can be used at a later date by participants who either wish to apply for recognition of prior learning, or intend to enroll to be assessed. Therefore, upfront enrollment becomes unnecessary, and expectations of commitment to certificates, diplomas, degrees are eliminated along with commitment to full time or part time study, and timetables which are inflexible for participants.

Instead of focusing on the assessment and completion of qualifications, events and activities are coordinated to fit with the learning outcomes of the certificates, diplomas and degrees.  This approach enables emphasis to be placed on curating the learning programme (similar to that of a film festival coordinator perhaps), and facilitating peoples' association and progress through that programme.

;Who pays?
One of the concerns associated with open access learning relates to overheads, running costs and who pays for what. The formally enrolled participants pay fees as normal when they enroll in the course upfront and thus commit to all that is required. They receive their study allowance or loan, and start accumulating their study debt (or pay upfront). The programme receives the government subsidy for the enrolled students, who are provided with access to all the content, learning support and assessment services afforded to them normally. The people who take advantage of the open access option (informal enrollment) have access to  scheduled events, and pay an admission fee to cover costs, if any, and are informed about how to access the online textbook, with an option to purchase the printed version. All events (where practical) whether short or long, are recorded and published for free online access and use. The online material created for the course is used to support face-to-face events and activities. Care is taken to ensure that formally enrolled participants have assured access to the events and activities, and that their enrollment fee is less than the total admission fees an informal participant would pay for all the events. 

;Summary
Hillary's team has developed an open access course, Planning for Small Business, to cater for the requests of people who want more applied, practical, and more immediately relevant learning activities. The content provided by an open textbook is separated slightly from the learning process, and is openly accessible and connected to ‘chunked’ learning activities. The learning sequence involves short events and longer workshops, within a curated programme of events. When people attend events they have the choice of engaging in short learning activities which can be accumulated for assessment and accreditation, or they can can commit to the assessment and certification process upfront and use the events and activities to achieve the learning outcomes. All resources are freely available online, but are also available as packaged resources, for a fee.

== Pay it Forward Learning ==

The [http://teachandlearnonline.blogspot.com/2006/01/learning-should-be-free-its-education.html Pay it Forward Learning] approach is based on a model for free learning proposed by staff at the Western Sydney Institute of TAFE in 2005.  The proposal includes giving each a student a laptop and broadband connection, and offers discounted assessment which is based on participants' contributions to course development.

{|
|[[Image:Leighblackall-76203109.jpg|frame|left|'''Application:''' A single mum, Ruby, makes herself known to an Outreach coordinator as someone wanting to train at home while looking after her baby. A curriculum is negotiated, and it is decided that she could complete competencies in word processing and Internet research, learning online from home. (Replace word processing and Internet research with the appropriate learning outcome.)]]
|[[Image:Leighblackall-76202407.jpg|frame|left|'''Issued laptop and network connection:''' Ruby is issued a laptop, complete with a range of open source software needed to complete her course. She is also given a broadband connection. The laptop and connection cost the Outreach center a total of $1000 per year. (Such a laptop is now available in the NZ market. It is the Asus Eee PC, available at Dicksmith for around NZ$599. Good broadband costs approximately $30 per month. Total of package = $929.)]]
|[[Image:Leighblackall-76202405.jpg|frame|left|'''Learn online through the wiki courses:''' Ruby has an option to attend face-to-face sessions to help her with digital information literacies, and to familiarise herself with the devices she will need to use to complete the online course.

|[[Image:Leighblackall-76202404.jpg|frame|left|'''Course fees discounted:''' Each competency unit has an assignment that requires Ruby to develop a resource to teach someone new to the subject how to obtain that same competency. She also keeps notes about her learning, and loads each assignment to her web journal. When Ruby has finished a targeted number of assignments, she submits her web journal for assessment and recognition of prior learning (RPL).]]
|-
|[[Image:Leighblackall-76202403.jpg|frame|left|'''Resources published:''' The RPL process is used to take note of the assignments, and any excellent examples are given to the course coordinator for consideration for inclusion in the course wiki.

|[[Image:Leighblackall-76202402.jpg|frame|left|'''Gap training:''' Any gaps in competencies are discussed with the coordinator, and the curriculum is re-negotiated, thus encouraging Ruby to repeat assignments, or attend face-to-face sessions to achieve the competencies.]]
|[[Image:Leighblackall-76202401.jpg|frame|left|'''Collaboration pays the way:''' When Ruby has successfully completed all competencies she is ready for qualification. Before obtaining her qualification she must pay her fees, including the cost of the laptop and connection (which she will own).]]
|}
The final amount owed is determined by: (course costs + laptop and connection) – (assignments used in the course wiki) – (willingness to serve as a mentor to the next student learning online).

;For example

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Charges                                       
!Discounts
!Total owing
|-
| Laptop and connection - $1000
| Four assignments used as resources - $800
| 
|-
| Course costs - $1000
| 20hrs mentoring - $400
| 
|- 
| '''Total charges - $2000'''
| '''Total discounts - $1200'''
| '''Total owing - $800'''
|}

This particular student bought teaching and assessment services, a qualification and a laptop for $800, and this could be still further reduced if she created more resources and provided more mentoring.

==Out from Under the Umbrellas==
[[Image:Tallchris-14288252.jpg|thumb|500px]]
Another idea for open learning, coined as ''Out from Under the Umbrellas'', is designed to increase the autonomy and online presence of teachers, so an organisation is recognised by the individuals within it rather than by the way the organisation operates. This means that less reliance is put on the qualifications to 'sell' an organisation, and more emphasis is put on the professional reputation of the teaching staff to market the institution. 

You're on the teaching staff, so imagine if your institution allowed for more individualism. Your description of your work might be, &quot;Otago Polytechnic works for me&quot; rather than &quot;I work for Otago Polytechnic&quot;. How good would it be to work in a place where the brand, the infrastructure, the management, the hierarchy, and the assets are in some way answerable or subsumed to the individuals within the organisation ([http://teachandlearnonline.blogspot.com/2006/10/out-from-under-umbrellas.html Blackall, 2006]).

One way may be for individual teachers to come out from under the umbrella of the organisation, and be supported to develop their individualism, is if they are expected to establish and maintain an online and global presence. Their professional portfolios are always up to date – up to the second, with the work they are doing, their research, their ideas and thinking, their experiments, their teaching, and their communications with professional networks. A blog connected to a number of social networking sites (e.g., wikis, Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, Delicious, Youtube, Linked In, etc.) is one way to maintain a professional portfolio. Plus there are various web-based portfolio platforms which can serve the purpose.  The organisation potentially benefits from a more flexible, individually responsible, diverse work force, and representatives which can 'market' their work globally. The important point is that the organisation becomes far less centralised and less identifiable as the organisation, and is more clearly identified by the individuals within ([http://teachandlearnonline.blogspot.com/2006/10/out-from-under-umbrellas.html Blackall, 2006]). This has the potential to attract students who wish to study at the institution. Additionally, more flexible options for learning and gaining qualifications are required if an organisation is to survive in the global economy. 

The statement made by Stephen Downes, in a conversation with TANZ (Tertiary Accord of New Zealand) chief executives on 21 September 2006, emphasizes the reliance on qualifications in current educational models: “When the processes of formal training and assessment separate, institutionalised learning will be in crisis.”

The crisis has already begun in the tertiary sector with educational organisations offering a wide variety of both viable and nonviable programmes, and no longer enjoying exclusivity, or an abundance of government subsidies for students. Otago Polytechnic has a centre for assessing prior learning, Capable NZ, which was set up to provide fast-track qualifications where previous life experience is acknowledged. The RPL process for certification and training offers an opportunity for decentralisation, and the introduction of competition to what has previously been a public investment in qualification-rich education. Educational institutions and their faculties have recognised the need to provide more flexible ways of offering qualifications. The use of open education resources and social media is one way to provide flexible avenues for learning.

'''Scenario for change'''
A scenario is presented to help explain the current dilemma facing industry and tertiary organisations who provide training - inflexibility with the way qualifications are structured, and funding challenges. 

Builders in New Zealand, in the interests of quality assurance, will soon be required to have certification, however, there is a shortage of builders in many areas of NZ. Therefore, it may not be feasible, for one reason or another, for people already engaged in the building industry to leave their jobs and engage in long-term or even short-term study. One way to fast track certification, and to ensure a critical mass of builders continues to be available, is for training organisations and building associations to set up Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and flexible training opportunities.  If done well, the RPL process can be a fast track, cheaper option for certification. 

Educational organisations can choose to offer RPL assessment for multiple industry sectors, or focus on specific, just-in-time training which is flexible and situated in the workplace. Therefore, more options are made available for people requiring certification and/or further training. It is likely that stakeholders may welcome shorter and/or more flexible training and certification opportunities, and assessment that is customised to their needs. This is potentially beneficial for educational providers, especially if secondary schools align their curricula with the tertiary sector, because seamless study opportunities between school and the workplace then become available, and funding designated to support this approach is used to bolster the finances of organisations struggling in the present financial climate. The philosophy underpinning open education resources supports such flexibility because development of resources is done collaboratively, and they are shared and distributed openly.

==What would it be like to be the rain==

If educational institutions are to come 'out from under the umbrellas' and decentralise, formal teaching and learning, assessment and accreditation requires change, and the way in which this might occur is described here. 

If teachers have a strong Internet presence, they can enter into open discourse about about their subjects, model effective practice, and lead networked learning by example. If they share their knowledge and ideas, and actively seek assistance with what they don’t know and understand, and can do this with the backing of their institution, they can enter into more creative teaching environments. For example: people all around the world are using the worlds biggest and most successful training provider (Google + Wikipedia + Youtube) to find information, and to communicate around what they're wanting and needing to learn. With a strong and established Internet presence, the brave new teachers are easily found, and have the opportunity to contribute to this type of open and informal learning. Once teachers reach this point it is possible to start to think about ways to match this informal learning with institutionalised education and assessment.

Start by looking at how Ask A Ninja (2006) explains [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEmss2lg-ug podcasting].

In the Youtube video, Ninja describes the world of people who seek ideas, entertainment, information and distraction online. These people wander the landscape of search engine results, random hyperlinks and web posts, that is, they engage in surfing the net. While doing this surfing, they may find content which captures their attention, and is relevant to what they want to learn.  The challenge for networking teachers is how to develop a web presence in such a way that people when surfing will find the teachers' content, and want to come back, subscribe, or otherwise tune in. 

'''An example of a teacher using open resources'''

A person exploring an interest in architecture, for instance, may discover something which a teacher of an architectural subject has uploaded to the Internet - a quick video demonstrating how to measure a house, and use Google Sketch Up to draw plans for house renovation. The person finds and watches the video, and as a result is interested to find out more about the subject. If the teacher describes how the material relates to formal training and assessment, and links to other resources, as well as providing advice on what the next steps in the process might be, this can draw potential students not only to the teacher but also to the organisation.

It is advisable if open educational resources are bite-sized chunks of information that are linked to similar material. For example, video demonstrations, short audio recorded interviews (5 – 10 minutes) with practitioners from New Zealand and around the world, a well designed online text (with the option for a print copy) which inspires people to think differently about the subject, or recordings of short 10 – 15 minute presentations. The work of Salman Khan and the [http://www.khanacademy.org/ Kahn Academy] is inspiring. He is one of many individuals around the world already taking the OER approach to teaching. Once people find teachers through their strong online presence, they may choose to follow the conversations and learning which the teachers are facilitating, and start to relate to the students' experiences. The absence of an enrollment fee, password and login profile to block their access, enables people to see that becoming a qualified architect, for example, is a possibility for them, perhaps achievable in their spare time after work. If some of these people make contact with the teacher, and they are invited to share information about themselves and enter into a conversation about the subject, they may become interested in participating.  The teacher may invite them to join a web conference to find out more about the subject, and to meet others. 

In this model, the teacher has to manage quite a bit of online social activity around their subject area, but if the time is spent treating people as individuals, respectful of each individual's capacity and time frame, a relationship can be nurtured to help people with their interests.  Thus teachers facilitate as equals, as participants in their own courses, and as participants in a network.

To review, if individual teachers have strong, networked, Internet presence built on the basis of open educational content, which is published on popular social media sites, potential students are drawn into this world of information and communication. Their focus on a particular element of content may lead them to other networked content. At any point, opportunities to communicate around the material are available. Therefore, when the communication starts, so does the relationship between the teacher and the informal learner, and there is an opportunity for prolonging engagement in the educational experience.

'''But who pays?'''

Informal learning is free! However, some participants may choose to pay because they seek accreditation - some may want recognition for their work, or others may legally require it to do further work. A fee may be paid by the participant, or the employer, or by the government or via a scholarship.  When the time for accreditation is agreed on (in other words when the teacher and the student agree they are both ready), the student enrolls and pays a fee, and the student is assessed. Prior to that, the student has engaged in the subject as an informal participant. The assessment can be negotiated to include a range of activities in which the student may have already participated, e.g., assignments, communications, readings, portfolio, work experience, projects, interviews, etc. It is at the point when assessment is agreed on that payment is made.  The learning was free, but the student incurs assessment and accreditation costs. This model encourages 100% completion and pass rates, with fewer enrollees who &quot;fail&quot;, &quot;drop out&quot;, or &quot;do not complete&quot;.

== Could we make NZ education free? ==
[[Image:Sweet_free_hugs.jpg|thumb|500px|To see someone who was once frowning, smile even for a moment, is worth it every time. Visit the 'free hugs' set [http://www.flickr.com/photos/eelssej_/sets/72157594543520682/ here].]]

In 2010, total student debt in New Zealand is over $11 billion and counting ([http://www.students.org.nz/ NZUSA, 2010]). In the rest of the world, masses of people cannot afford an education ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty#Education Wikipedia, 2010]). 

Tertiary education in New Zealand is publicly funded through a system known as Equivalent Full Time Student (EFTS). Basically, the government gives money to a course on a per student basis, with the amount determined by the credits or points value of the course, how many learning hours there are, and what the equivalent is in full-time weeks. Different institutions add a fee on top of the EFTS funding for each student to cover over all operating costs not covered by the subsidy. The following scenario provides some costings and an argument for providing free informal learning.

A programme or qualification with one full EFTS is worth approximately NZ$7000. One course with an EFTS value of 0.04 EFTS is run over 10 weeks at five hours per week. The government funding available for one student is 0.04 of $7000 = $280. A facilitator is required to commit five hours per week to run the course.
*How many students are needed to run a course on EFTS funding only? 
*How much does it cost to run the course?

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Item !! Notes !! Costs
|-
| Facilitator || 50 hours at $50 per hour || $2500
|-
| Marketing and administration || promotion, printing material, and administrative assistance|| $1000
|-
| Learning support services || Community Learning Centres (unsure of costs), student support services (costing shows levy), and library services (unsure of costs)|| $500
|-
|Total|| Cost of running the course|| $4000
|}

Assuming the course can be supported by the EFTS funding only (without the need to charge students a fee), a minimum of 15 formally enrolled EFTS-funded students are required to cover the costs of running the course, as estimated.  Therefore, the course is effectively free to 15 students.  As a result of the government funding, $267 is paid to the institution for each New Zealand resident that enrolls in the course. Currently, there is a cap on the number of EFTS students allowed into courses. 

'''Now how do we make it free for everyone?'''

If 15 people are government funded and do not have to pay a fee, it is unlikely they will mind if other people do the course for free. Theoretically, 20, 30, or 100 people can be accepted into the course if it can run for the estimated cost of $4000, and the learning outcomes and quality of the course are not adversely affected. Once 15 New Zealand residents are enrolled, the course can start and be open to others - from anywhere, for free. The 15 New Zealand residents have the opportunity to be educated along with 20, 30, or 100 other international and local people, thus engaging in a richer learning experience. New Zealand education can therefore be used to promote future investment, migration or other international exchanges. This model can work, as long as the 15 New Zealand resident students are not compromised by the additional students, and their learning outcomes are enhanced. Costs for running a course naturally vary between organisations, therefore the model which is presented, is an estimate only.

We recommend that academics and educators use the popular Internet as their platform for open education and research. Doing so will render their work more accessible, helping them to connect with other practitioners and potential learners, informing future teachers and researchers, and enabling (through open formats and free copyrights) the development of diverse and sometimes innovative practices from which they themselves may learn.

So what is the &quot;popular Internet&quot;? We'll start by looking at some simple user statistics in Australia...

== Internet in Australia ==

[[Image:02-Popular Internet in Teaching and Research.png|thumb|500px]]

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, of a total population of 21 million Australians, there were 10 million using a broadband Internet in 2009, with 9.8 million for personal use, 5.3 for education, and 5.2 for work. By way of forecast, 96% of 12-14 year olds use the Internet for educational purposes. That's a generation 5 years our from a tertiary level of education.

What though, is the most popular aspects of the Internet to those Australians?

== 10 most visited websites ==

[[Image:03-Popular Internet in Teaching and Research.png|thumb|500px]]

According to [http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/AU Australian Internet usage data gathered by Alexa.com], the top 10 most visited websites in Australia are:

# google.com.au - Search the web from Google Australia's homepage.
# facebook.com - A social utility that connects people, to keep up with friends, upload photos, share links and videos.
# google.com - Enables users to search the Web, Usenet, and images. Features include PageRank, caching and translation of results, and an option to find similar pages. The company's focus is developing search technology.
# youtube.com - YouTube is a way to get your videos to the people who matter to you. Upload, tag and share your videos worldwide!
# yahoo.com - Personalized content and search options. Chatrooms, free e-mail, clubs, and pager.
# live.com - Search engine from Microsoft.
# eBay.com.au - Auction sales with a focus on Australian buyers and sellers. Includes policies, search by produ... Morect type, and links into the international site for additional listings.
# wikipedia.org - An online collaborative encyclopedia.
# twitter.com - Social networking and microblogging service utilising instant messaging, SMS or a web interface..
# blogger.com - Free, automated weblog publishing tool that sends updates to a site via FTP.

Interestingly, an encyclopedia ranks at 8th most visited website, followed by a self publishing service named Blogger. Search engines, social networking, social media and social trading occupying the other places in the rank. So we could perhaps boil this down to Australian's primarily search for local content, socialise on Facebook, share videos on Youtube, trade on eBay, and refer to a socially generated encyclopedia for information. A significant proportion then use Twitter and Blogger to both read and write. Clearly the Internet in Australia is a socially constructed experience.

In contrast to this, [http://chronicle.com/article/Professors-Use-of/123682/?sid=wc&amp;utm_source=wc&amp;utm_medium=en recently published research] (admittedly from the USA) showed an average of 82% of Faculty in universities never use social media in their research or teaching! A similar study has not been conducted in Australia.

[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Products/4901.0~Apr+2009~Main+Features~Internet+use+and+mobile+phones?OpenDocument Children's Participation in Cultural and Leisure Activities, Australia, Apr 2009] - The proportion of children accessing the Internet increased by age, with 60% of 5 to 8 year olds accessing the Internet compared with 96% of 12 to 14 year olds.

[http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4102.0Chapter10002008 Australian Social Trends, 2008] - Almost all (98%) of the 9.9 million Australians who used the Internet at home reported using it for this purpose. Just over half (53%) used the Internet for education or study and a similar proportion (52%) used it for work related purposes.

== Opportunities ==

[[Image:04-Popular Internet in Teaching and Research.png|thumb|500px]]

Apart from the [[Open Education Practices: A User Guide for Organisations/Measuring_Open_Education|measurable opportunities]] in terms of engagement, marketing, and savings in infrastructure and service costs, academics and teachers have the opportunity to establish a web presence for themselves and their work. This can help to connect and network with people who share interest in their field, which can lead to a range of opportunities from new students to contract work and networked teaching.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Vayikra/Leviticus 1:1-5:6[6:7]
Yeshayahu/Isaiah 43:1-44:3;  Romans 8:1-13

Vayikra,&quot;And He Called,” also the name of this book, begins “Leviticus,” commonly called such because of its continual reference to the functions of the Levites.  Much of this book details the ordinances that God gave Israel to make them a set-apart people from the rest of the nations which they were going to live near in the Promised Land. 

Another name for the book of Leviticus is the “Torah of the Priests.”    This is the name given to it in the lexicon of the Talmudic Sages,  because most of the book deals with the laws of the Temple service and other laws relating to the priests, their service and their responsibilities. (The Stone Edition Tanakh)    
As Israel is a “Kingdom of Priests,” this means all the people, not only the Levitical Priests, can learn about serving God and need to, so as to understand what is required of them in worshipping Yahweh and walking in righteousness with Him.

Jewish children begin their study of the Torah, not with the book of Genesis, but with the book of Leviticus.   This is based on the fact that sin is the first thing we need to learn how to deal with in our walk as a believer.  We will never maintain our relationship if we do not know the way to restore it when we violate His commandments.   The Rabbis consideration is that in a child’s purity he will receive the purity of Yahweh’s sacrificial laws and thereby the need to be holy.    

As Israel is a “Kingdom of Priests,” this means all the people, not only the Levitical Priests, can learn about serving God and need to, so as to understand what is required of them in worshipping Yahweh and walking in righteousness with Him. The question has been asked, “Why should we as ‘Messianic believers’ have to read about the priesthood?”   Because we are to become a kingdom of priests (1 Peter 2 &amp; Exodus 19:5,6 etc.), doing service to our God.   How else will we know how to fulfill our responsibilities if we do not read the Torah?
The benefit today in studying the sacrificial system and priesthood, when their is no standing Temple then, is the understanding of God’s principles that it gives.


&lt;u&gt;The Purpose of the Sacrifices&lt;/u&gt;

Leviticus is the Book of Yahweh’s grace to man.  Throughout the Torah only the name Yahweh, the name representing His attribute of Mercy, is used in connection with offerings and never the name God which represents His attribute of judgment.
The ancient pagans and many Christian believe that the purpose of animal sacrifices were to appease an angry and wrathful God. Such a concept is foreign to Hebraic thought.  The Old Testament is full of expressions of the mercy and grace of Yahweh, therefore, grace and mercy are not attributes of His character only delineated in the New Testament, contrary to popular belief.

Many perceive Vayikra/Leviticus as a book of staunch “rules and regulations,” but when viewed as a critical component of Israel’s “constitution,&quot;just like the Bill of Rights is perceived as a critical component of a nation’s constitution, perhaps Vayikra/Leviticus is not as bad or “demanding” as commonly thought.

The reason for our aversion to Leviticus is largely based upon our revulsion at the thought of animal sacrifice.
The laws of sacrifice and sacrificing animals disconcert us. We prefer to think that the sacrifices were only to teach the Israelites about Yeshua, and we comfort ourselves with the notion that the ‘New Testament’ abolishes sacrifice.   But this reality of the need of sacrifice is integral to the fact of man’s sin.    The mess of the blood and guts involved in the sacrifice is illustrative of the mess and disembowelling of life which our sin causes.  The correction and reversal of the results of sin cannot be done with out blood-shedding. How merciful is our Father that He ordains an animal to die in our place and how much more careful we might be if we saw that a life was taken each time we committed a trespass.

Does God require our gifts to appease Him or assuage Him?   “If you have acted righteously, what have you given Him?” (Job 35:7); God does not become enriched by man’s largess.’ (Tanach, Stone Edition, ArtScroll Series, Mesorah Publicaitons, p. 243)
The sacrificing of an animal was a substitute for the “Lamb” who was to come and it was through faith in the atonement offered through Him, that sins  and trespasses were forgiven.

When the smell of the burnt sacrifice ascended to Yahweh, He took pleasure in the aroma of it. That aroma of flesh that was sacrificed was pleasant to Him.  How much more when we put to death our flesh and sacrifice our pleasures so that our life ascends to Him as a smell-smelling sacrifice, an aroma that savours those around us.


&lt;u&gt;The Meaning of Sacrifice&lt;/u&gt;

Sacrifices did not begin with the Tabernacle.   Adam, Able, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Moses all offered animal sacrifices before this.  This indicates that there was an understanding of what was required before Sinai, going back all the way to Adam.

Here begins the requirements of ‘sacrifices’. The English language does not have a word that accurately expresses the concept of a ‘korban’.  The word “sacrifice” implies that the person bringing it is expected to deprive himself of something valuable — but God finds no joy in His children’s anguish or deprivation. “Offering” is more positive and closer to the mark, but it too falls short of the Hebrew word ‘korban’.

The word “korbon” has the root ‘karov’ which means “to bring near”, hence a “drawing close.”    
The sacrifices and offerings are intended to be the means to draw us “closer” to God. Sin is the main hindrance in coming into intimate fellowship with God, so Yahweh in His mercy made it possible for the sinner to bring a sacrifice which “if offered in the right spirit, is the medium whereby man attains closer nearness to the divine..”  (Rabbi Hertz - The Penteteuch and Haftarah p.410)

It is important to understand that in our world today, if one does not acknowledge or come to a realization that he/she has missed the mark of obedience to Yahweh ‘ ordinances and commandments, they will not come forth to ask for forgiveness.  They would not see a need to come forward; they would not see themselves as having trespassed Yahweh’ commandments or having erred. 


&lt;u&gt;The Burnt Offering&lt;/u&gt;   Leviticus Chapter 1

The Burnt Offering or “ascension offering” is “olah” which means “go up”, “rise up”, “climb”, “ascend”, “sprout”, “come forth”,  That teaches us that the olah offering is an offering that ascends to heaven.  It also lifts the one who makes the sacrifice.  It must, therefore, be offered by fire.  Fire is a form of energy.  In order for an offering to be pleasing, it must be given with joy and with the passion of our love for Him in our hearts.   When Israel’s offering was pure and acceptable to Him, He acknowledged it by fire and consumed the sacrifice.   He will reciprocate the offering of our love by consuming us with the passion of His love.

All aspects of the ordained sacrifice are a prophetic shadow-picture of Messiah’s offering and what a believer must do in our relationship with Him.  A lamb was offered twice daily (Ex. 28:38-42) picturing our need to come to our Father in Heaven each day through the shed blood of Yeshua and offer our lives afresh in thanks and praise to Him (Heb. 13:15; Rom. 12:1-2).   In Lev. 1:9 Yahweh required the legs and inwards of the animal to be washed in the laver. What this represent spiritually in the Believer’s life is the need for our daily walk and our inward parts to be cleansed by obedience to His Word.  


&lt;u&gt;The Grain Offering&lt;/u&gt;   Leviticus:-6

Believers are at times likened unto grain, or more specifically, that of the harvest, as Yeshua says “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore beseech Yahweh of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest”   (Loukas/Luke 10:). 

Hopefully, we compose the first fruits of a great harvest of Believers, as we are to present ourselves as “an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma”  (Ephesians 5: 2).  

This admonition is in complete line with the instruction Yahweh gave in relation to the grain offering.  If the grain was to be given unto Yahweh baked, it was to be in the form of “unleavened cakes” or “unleavened wafers.”  It was to be broken, oil was to be poured upon it, and it was to be a sweet offering to God.   We as Believers are to be as the grain offering of unleavened bread presented before Yahweh. We are to be without sin and crushed (self-life broken), ready to emanate a pleasant aroma to our Heavenly Father, able, willing and ready to accomplish His tasks.

In 1 Corinthians 5:7-8 Paul said,  “Thoroughly clean out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, just as you are unleavened. For Messiah our Pesach also has been sacrificed. Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness,but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.&quot;
Paul here admonishes the Corinthians to search their hearts for the “leaven” of sin and remove it and remember Messiah, Who is our Passover Lamb sacrificed.  He asks us to celebrate the festival as a community of unleavened bread with sincerity and truth.

Let us be instructed from the example of the grain offering and take this to heart.  The unleavened bread brought before Yahweh represents us as forgiven Believers.  The broken unleavened bread as an offering likewise hopefully represents us, who are broken and willing vessels ready to fulfill the Father’s tasks.
When we understand this level of Vayikra/Leviticus, it is not a codification of “strict rules and regulations” in the least. It is rather important instruction for all generations of Believers!

The Meal Offering was baked by fire. (see Isa. 53:5; Psa.22:15; Luke 56-24:1; John 6:63)   It is the fire which transforms the crushed grain to become one whole loaf as a corporate Body presented before Him.  (see  Matt. 5:10-13; Jn.16:33; 2 Tim. 3:12). We have a choice, according to our spiritual resources, to offer the more costly sacrifice of complete dedication unto Him or to contribute our single grain to be mixed and made into a communal offering by His Spirit with the service of the rest of the Body.


&lt;u&gt;Covenant of Salt&lt;/u&gt;   Leviticus 2:13 –   Brit Mehlach.

Rambam says (SEC pg. 553) that salt has 2 properties.   It is destructive because it prevents plants from growing and can corrode most materials.   And it is a preservative.   The Covenant of Salt teaches that the Altar service preserves Israel.

Yahshua tells us in Matthew 5:13, we are to be the “salt of the earth” – we are to be the preservers of Yahweh’s covenant.  If we followed this Covenant of Salt analogy, we, as the “salt of the earth” are to:  Prevent from growing those things that are against Yahweh’s Torah.  Corrode and ultimately destroy those things that are against Yahweh’s Torah.   Preserve those things that are of and for Yahweh’s Torah.


&lt;u&gt;Peace Offerings&lt;/u&gt;  Leviticus chapter 3  

The Peace Offering or Fellowship Offering was a voluntary offering brought by a person or a group of people where one desired fellowship or communion with Yahweh.  The purpose of the peace offering is to show the person’s love toward Yahweh.  It is also to show gratitude for Yahweh’s goodness and to draw the person closer to Yahweh.  This offering may be called a peace offering or “shalamim” because it has the spiritual capacity to bring peace to the world.The person who brings a peace offering is not motivated by a need for atonement for sin.  The person is motivated by a sense of wholeness or a desire for wholeness.

Only a part of the peace offering was given to the temple.  The rest was eaten anywhere in the court or within the walls of Yerushalayim. Through this offering one could enjoy fellowship with the Eternal and dine with family and friends. This offering brings enjoyment to one’s intimate relationship with the Eternal.  The Peace offering basically says: You are my joy and my enjoyment. I want to be near you together with my family and my friends, take time in your presence, worship you, and receive your blessings.

There can be no peace though between a man and his Creator until a man’s sin is first atoned for.   Therefore, for the Peace Offering to occur one had to be in a spiritual state of peace, good health or balance before God with regard to sin.   Only then can we have true fellowship with our Heavenly Father, and this occurs through the sacrificial work of Yeshua the Messiah and a man’s identification with or appropriation of that work to himself (of which immersion or baptism is a picture [see Rom. 6:3-6]).   In this regard, read Ephesians 2:14; Philippians 3:10; 2:5-8; 4:2; 2:14.   Yeshua is the Prince of Peace   (see Isa. 9:6)

&lt;u&gt;Sin Offering&lt;/u&gt;   Leviticus Chapter Four 

The Sin Offering was presented for unintentional or intentional sin for which no restitution was possible, but it had to be accompanied by repentance or divine forgiveness was withheld   (Num. 15:30). 
The Trespass or Guilt Offering was for a inadvertent or careless sin of a lesser degree for which restitution could be made.  According to Talmudic tradition based on Torah, a sin offering is not needed if a sin was committed accidentally and without intent. This could also be applied to someone who did not know about the sin.   On the other hand, a sin offering is needed if the sin was committed – “inadvertently” – as a result of carelessness.   

According to Rambam, an unintentional sin still blemishes the soul and it requires purification. If the sinner regarded Yahweh’s commands with more care, the unintentional sin would not have occurred.  The concept is that people are careful about things that matter to them.  However, they are careless about things that do not matter to them. Many people are careless about honoring Shabbat, if they honor it at all, because it does not matter to them. This even applies to the church’s, so called, “sabbath” of Sunday.

Sin in and of itself can never be forgiven.  It is the person who sinned that can be forgiven.  Sin can never be accepted by the Eternal.  Sin must be removed from man in order for him to be completely forgiven and restored.

&lt;u&gt;The Believer’s Access to Yahweh&lt;/u&gt;
Though it was impossible that the blood of bulls and goats would take away sin, it was neither by the blood of goats or calves, but by His own blood He entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of the red heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh: then how much more shall the blood of Messiah Yeshua.   Who through the eternal Ruach haKodesh offered Himself without spot to Yahweh, to purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living Yahweh.   And for this cause, He is our mediator today of the renewed testament with the people of Yisrael, that by means of death for the redemption of transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.   For where there is a testament, there must also of necessity be the death of a testator.

For the instructions of sacrifice having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things, could never with those sacrifices, which were offered year by year continually make those that came thereto perfect. For then would they not have ceased to be offered?

We know that the substitutionary form of forgiveness found in Wayiqra was temporary and, of course, pointed to a greater promise of Messiah Yeshua.  When you came forth with a sacrificial offering; it was an acknowledgement of sin as well as it presented an opportunity for the confession of that sin(s). It showed also a faith and belief that Yahweh was just and faithful in His promise to forgive. Yahweh’ voice, spoken then through the mouth of Moses and His preserved written words for us today, called us to repentance, then as well as today. But Yeshua’s sacrifice is wholly different, higher and greater, transcending the earthly sacrifices spoken of in Leviticus.
Messiah “has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.” (Hebrews 9:26)  He loved us “and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.” (Ephesians 5:2)   He has made atonement by “better sacrifices than these,” (Hebrews 9:23) even by His own body and blood, “a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God.” (Romans 12:1)  

Therefore, you can draw near to God “knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Messiah. For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world.” 	(1 Peter 1:18–20)

Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Yeshua, by a new and living way which He has consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, His flesh; and having a high priest over the house of Elohim; let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for He is faithful that promised)  Hebrews 10:19-23

The lesson to glean from this week’s Torah lesson is the depth and great lengths of the heavenly Father’s call for each of our lives.   He is not, willing that any should perish, but that all should have everlasting life.   The kohanim/priests were designated for the sole purpose of bringing restoration and reconciliation between the people of Yisrael and Yahweh.   What a calling!   Reconciling the Children of Yisrael back into a proper relationship with Yahweh.

Yahweh’s love and compassion is such that He reaches out to man to make it possible for all to come into relationship with Him. He made provisions so that even the poorest and most economically disadvantaged individuals in Yisrael could bring an offering.   This is seen clearly from the fact that a burnt-offering (Chapter 1) could be fulfilled through bringing a bull, a goat, or a dove, depending on one’s means.  See the offering for fowls, Leviticus 1:14.  (Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?  Yeshua said.  Matthew 10:29).  How wonderful is our God that no one is excluded or placed beyond His mercy and compassion if they will but come to repentance and exercise faith in His sacrificial work for atonement of sin.

=So few=
After more than seven years of social media disrupting almost every sector in industrialised societies, more than 80% of lecturers still report ''never'' using social media  in their work (Kamenetz, 2010) &lt;ref&gt;Anya Kamenetz. [http://diyubook.com/2010/07/vast-majority-of-professors-are-rather-ludditical Professors Rather Ludditical]. http://diyubook.com, July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;. Many have argued, and some have demonstrated the benefits that the Internet and social media offer educational objectives, but the majority of practitioners in higher education and training remain unconvinced. More than 80% have never edited, joined in a discussion, or peer reviewed a featured Wikipedia article. More than 80% have never loaded a video to Youtube, created a playlist, or embedded a video in their educational material. More than 80% have never engaged in a blogging network, or used an RSS reader. More than 80% of university and college graduates are therefore going out into their communities and professions without their teachers exposing them to social media in their curriculum.

=Why?=
What is the reason for 80% of lecturers choosing not to use social media in their work? Apart from a plethora of anecdotal reasons expressed throughout the blogging networks of educational developers, some research has focused on this sort of question. Graham Attwell (2010) recently reviewed a range of research &lt;ref&gt;Graham Attwell. [http://www.pontydysgu.org/2010/08/teachers-dispositions/ Teachers Dispositions]. Pontydysgu.org, August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; that found a combination of influences were causing the slow uptake of social media in education. For example:

# Experiences, predispositions and attitudes of people before they became teachers;
# Prior knowledge and expectations of the profession of 'teacher';
# A disconnect between how people use the Internet for personal use, and a lack of confidence in how they would use it professionally;
# The pressures and restraints that institutions place on teachers, preventing them from developing confidence and awareness;
# A lack of motivation, engagement, interest or commitment to the use of the Internet and social media in teaching practice;
# A prevalence for institutions to drive technology use which is based on institutional concerns rather than the opportunities for teaching and learning.
 

=What institutions can do=
By reviewing their policies, procedures, rewards and incentives, institutions can address all but the first two reasons in the short term. In the long term, they can address teachers' preconceived ideas, dispositions and attitudes, and their prior knowledge and expectations of the profession by introducing positive discrimination to influence changes in culture within a reasonable time frame, therefore, making up for lost time. This long term planning should aim for establishing senses of autonomy, mastery and purpose (Pink, 2009)&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Pink. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvAUbU9Y The Surprising Science of Motivation]. TED Talks, August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Institutions can do the following:'''

# Look at the practices of teachers and students who are confident with social media (both for their personal and professional use), and open education and research practices, and consider how such use might scale within the institution;
# Give teachers time to explore, 'play' and share experiences in using Internet and social media in their work (Hegarty, Penman, Kelly, Jeffrey, Coburn &amp; McDonald, 2010);
# Offer a range of staff development opportunities to raise capability and enhance self-efficacy in ICT, including project-based approaches and support for communities of practice to develop (Hegarty, Penman, Brown, Coburn, Gower, Kelly et al., 2005);
# Recognise, incentivise and reward practices that show motivation, engagement, interest or commitment in using Internet and social media for teaching, research and learning (Hegarty et al., 2005);
# Review technology and support services that are provided and maintained by the institution, and identify where they serve primarily an institutional need (Hegarty, et al, 2010); 
# Use discoveries in step one to inform discussions on alternative ideas for the provision of technologies and services;
# Use autonomy, mastery and purpose as guiding principles in this work;

=An example=

# If Skype is evidently a popular personal technology for telephone and videophone use, an institutional support service could work towards making such a device usable within the institution, and sponsor meetings and discussions on how it can be used professionally - such as international guest lectures, project collaboration, etc..
# If uStream, Youtube, Blip.tv, and Internet Archive are popular services offering functionality to video record, live stream, store, deliver and socially network video audio visual content, then institutions would be advised to ensure these services are usable on their network, and sponsor meetings and discussions on how they can by used professionally.
# If Wikipedia is a popular information source for teachers, students and the wider community, then policies and practices can be devised to encourage engagement, participation and critical appreciation of the project and its processes. 
# If the institution has policies and procedures that effectively block or discourage teachers or students engaging in these services professionally, such as Intellectual Property and Copyright policies, or Network Security procedures, then make it a priority to review and change these.
# If the institution financially rewards practices that circumvent engagement with social media, such as the rewards for successfully publishing in elite and exclusive academic journals, then balance this investment with financial rewards for teachers and academics who academically engage in using open journals and popular social media outlets.
# If the institution invests in marketing, consider the complimentary value to both brand awareness and educational outcomes, by investing marketing budgets into the production of education and research media for open publishing on popular social media channels.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOCright}}
So far in this chapter, you have learned about erosion and deposition by moving water in rivers and the ocean, erosion and deposition by glacial ice and erosion and deposition by wind. With this long list, you may think that we have covered all the types  of erosion and deposition that can possibly occur. The force you may have forgotten is gravity! Perhaps because it is a constant force or perhaps because it is invisible, students often forget that gravity also acts to shape the Earth's surface. The examples we will consider here include sudden, dramatic events like '''landslides''', as well as slow steady movements that happen over long periods of time. Whatever the example, we know that the force of gravity will always be there and it is changing the Earth's surface right now.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Describe the ways that material can move downhill by gravity.
* Discuss the factors that increase the possibility of landslides.
* Describe the different types of gravity driven movement of rock and soil.
* Describe ways to prevent and be aware of potential landslides or mudflows.

==Gravity Moves Material Downhill==
There are several ways that gravity can move material from a higher place to a lower one. Sometimes this happens along a cliff or a very steep slope. Material that has been loosened by some type of weathering simply falls away from the cliff because there is nothing to keep it in place. If you were to keep nudging your notebook towards the edge of your desk, eventually enough of the notebook would be off the desk to cause it to fall. Landslides happen when large amounts of rock suddenly fall down a cliff or mountainside.

Other times gravity simply makes things slide along rather slowly. You may have seen this as a classmate moves further and further down in their seat. It's not a very fast or dramatic movement, like your notebook falling to the floor, but slowly your friend is no longer sitting
up straight in the seat. The same thing can happen to rock or even whole parts of a hillside. This might happen over a period of days or even weeks. In the end, the whole area of soil or rock has slid to a lower spot.

The last way that gravity moves material along is when it becomes very wet. '''Saturated''' soil flows downhill, often removing trees, homes and bridges that are in the way. To help you understand how water increases the chances of movement, think about playing in sand at the beach. If you were making a sand castle with dry sand, you could not build walls very well. If you add a little bit of water, it helps your walls to stand. A little bit of water helps to hold grains of sand or soil together. However, if you added lots of water, what would happen? Too much water causes the sand to flow quickly away. There are a couple of ways that soil or rock can get very wet and flow. Sometimes this happens if it has been raining for a very long time or if it rains very hard. In the spring, snow and ice begins to melt and much of this water moves into the ground. Springtime is a particularly dangerous time for landslides because there are heavier and more frequent rainfalls at this time of year and it is also the season when snow and ice melt. Extra water in the soil adds more weight to the slope and also makes the grains of soil lose contact with each other, allowing them to flow.

==Contributing Factors==
There are several factors that increase the chance that a landslide will occur. Some of these we can prevent and some we cannot. Whenever we dig into the base of a slope, this contributes to the likelihood of a landslide. There are many reasons why we might need to do this. We may want to build a house on flat ground, so we level out an area by cutting into a hillside. Roads and railroad tracks also need to be flat and level, so excavation of a slope could be necessary in areas where we travel frequently. This is particularly dangerous when the underlying rock layers also slope towards the area that is cut away or when layers of clay are present. If rock layers slope towards the region that is removed, then the support for those layers is gone and the overlying rocks can slip away, causing a landslide (Figure 10.46).

[[File:Slope of underlying materials.png|center|frame|'''Figure 10.46''': The slope of underlying materials must be considered when making road cuts.]]

Soils rich in clay are water holding types of soils. If you have ever worked with clay in art class, you know that when clay is wet, it is very slippery. If there is a lot of clay in the soil, the clays hold onto the water when it rains. This slippery clay layer provides an easy surface for materials to slide over.

[[File:Stone Retaining wall.jpg|270px|thumb|'''Figure 10.47''': It is important to reinforce a slope that has been cut away in order to prevent landslides.]]

When construction workers need to cut into slopes for building a home or road, it is important to stabilize the slope to help prevent a landslide (Figure 10.47). Some ways that you may have seen on steep slopes along a highway include building supports into the slope or planting vegetation to keep the soil in place. Trees have deeper roots than grasses, but each type of plant produces benefits for particular areas. It is also a good idea to provide drainage for groundwater so that the slope does not become saturated.

One well known cause of landslides is from the ground shaking. Sometimes the ground shakes from an earthquake, a volcanic eruption or even just a truck going by. We can't control earthquakes or volcanoes and some of the most devastating landslides have been started by these other natural hazards. Skiers and hikers need to be aware of the ways they disturb the snow they travel over or through to avoid setting off an '''avalanche'''. Most people buried by an avalanche do not survive, either because they freeze, are crushed by the weight of the snow or are unable to breathe. If you ski or snow board in deep powder, you should carry a small shovel in your backpack and attach a long, red lightweight cord to your waist or carry a GPS radio transmitter to help rescuers locate you in the event of an avalanche.

==Types of Movement Caused by Gravity==
[[File:Yamnuska bottom cliff.jpg|thumb|250px|'''Figure 10.48''': Pieces of rock regularly fall to the base of cliffs and form slopes known as talus slopes.]]

Mechanical weathering loosens pieces of rock as water seeps into cracks in the rock and freezes. As these rocks fall, they form a big pile of angular rocks at the base of a cliff called a '''talus slope''' (Figure 10.48). If you travel along a road or highway through regions such as these, you may see signs warning of the danger along the road side. Sometimes as one rock falls, it hits another rock lower down, which hits another and so on and so forth. This is one way that a landslide or an avalanche can begin.

===Landslides and Avalanches===
[[File:Slide-guerrero1.JPG|thumb|250px|'''Figure 10.49''': Landslides are called rock slides by geologists.]]

Landslides and avalanches are the most dramatic, sudden and dangerous examples of earth materials moved by gravity. Usually the term landslide is used to mean solid rock that falls suddenly, whereas an avalanche is formed from snow. Most landslides happen along convergent plate boundaries, in regions of the world that are tectonically active. These regions are often mountainous and are places of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. When large amounts of rock suddenly break loose from a cliff or mountainside, they move quickly and with tremendous force (Figure 10.49). Scientists believe that air gets trapped under the falling rocks and acts as a cushion that keeps the rock from slowing down. Landslides and avalanches can move as fast as 200 to 300 km/hour (Figure 10.50).

[[File:Lawine.jpg|center|frame|'''Figure 10.50''': An avalanche of snow moves suddenly and quickly downslope, burying everything in its path.]]
{{clear}}
Landslides are exceptionally destructive. They can bury everything in their path, including entire villages. Some landslides have created lakes when the rocky material dams a river or stream. Often homes are destroyed as hillsides collapse. If a landslide flows into a lake or bay, they can trigger a tsunami. In July of 1958, a landslide of 30.6 cubic meters of rock fell from 914m up on a steep slope at the end of Lituya Bay in Alaska (Figure 10.51). As that large volume of rock suddenly pushed away all the water, a 524m tsunami was formed. The tsunami produced by the landslide knocked down all the trees and vegetation surrounding the bay. In the area directly opposite the landslide, trees at elevations higher than the Empire State Building were scoured off the valley walls. Fortunately, this event happened in an area where very few people were living. Most of the people who witnessed this event were in boats and most of them were able to survive because their boats rode on top of the wave, rather than being smashed by it.

[[File:Lituya Bay overview.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.51''': This photograph of Lituya Bay in Alaska shows (in light gray) the areas damaged by the tsunami produced by a landslide sent 30.6 million cubic meters of rock into the bay.]]

Landslides occur often in dry or semi-arid climates in areas with steep slopes or mountains. The California coastline, with its steep cliffs and years of drought punctuated by seasons of abundant rainfall, is more prone to landslides than many other regions. In areas where landslides are a frequent hazard, communities have put together warning systems, to help people be better prepared. Around San Francisco Bay, the National Weather Service and the United States Geological Survey have a set of rain gauges that monitor the condition of the soil. If soil becomes saturated, the weather service will issue a warning. Earthquakes, which can happen along western California's abundant faults, can also trigger landslides.

===Mudflows and Lahars===
'''Mudflows''' and '''lahars''' are also dramatic and dangerous natural hazards produced by the force of gravity (Figure 10.52). Mudflows tend to follow existing stream channels or ravines. Mudflows often occur on hillsides with soils rich in clay and with little sand or gravel. Where there is little rain, there is not much vegetation to hold the soil. That means mud will flow when a large storm produces a lot of rain in a short time. The saturated soils, without plant roots to keep them in place, flow downhill, following river channels, washing out bridges, trees and homes that are in their path.

[[File:Debris flow scars.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.52''': The white areas on the otherwise green mountainsides mark scars from numerous mudflows. Mud deposited by the flow can be seen along the river channels.]]

Some mudflows are as small as a few meters in length, width and depth. Others can travel for thousands of meters, moving materials tens of meters deep and hundreds of meters wide. On steep slopes, a mudflow might travel very quickly, ending abruptly when it reaches flatter ground. Thicker, more viscous mudflows move over a period of days or even years. The movement could be as slow as several millimeters/day or perhaps several meters/day.

A lahar is a particular type of mudflow that flows down the steep sides of a stratovolcano (Figure 10.53). These explosive volcanoes produce tremendous quantities of ash and dust as they erupt. Snow and ice from the top of the volcano melt, producing floods of meltwater.

[[File:MSH82 lahar from march 82 eruption 03-21-82.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.53''': A lahar is a mudflow that forms from volcanic ash and debris.]]

This now hot water mixes with volcanic ash to produce exceptionally hazardous flows that move as fast as 60 km/hour. In Columbia, the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in 1985 produced a lahar that killed more than 23,000 people as it swept over villages and flattened everything in its way. In 1991, a typhoon arrived just after Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines erupted. The rains soaked the volcanic ash and dust that blanketed the entire region and produced lahars that killed 1,500 people and displaced thousands more from their homes.

===Slump and Creep===
Fortunately not all types of erosion by gravity cause so many problems. Some less dramatic types of movement, correctly called '''slump''' and '''creep''', move earth materials slowly down a hillside. When materials slump down a hillside, they tend to move as a large block along a curved surface. This type of earth movement often happens when a slope is undercut, leaving little or no support for the overlying materials. It can also happen when too much weight is added to an unstable slope. It is very unfortunate when that extra weight comes from building someone's home on a slippery slope. When earth materials slump down a hillside, a crescent shaped scar marks the place they moved from (Figure 10.54). A wise homeowner will look for these crescent shaped scars along surrounding hillsides when considering buying a new home. If they are present, it is a good possibility that earth materials have slipped before.

[[File:Mupe Bay cliffs.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.54''': Material that slumps down a hillside often moves as a whole unit, leaving behind a crescent shaped scar.]]
[[File:Trees_showing_the_presence_of_creep.jpg|250px|thumb|'''Figure 10.55''': Trees with curved trunks are often signs that the hillside is slowly creeping downhill.]]

The term creep is used to describe the very gradual movement of soil downhill, because it just barely creeps along. Creep is such a slow way that earth materials move that no human would likely notice. One way to tell that earth materials are slowly moving downhill is to look at the growth of trees. Have you ever seen a tree whose trunk bends almost horizontally to the ground and then grows upwards? If there are many trees growing this way, it is likely that the ground is slowly moving down hill (Figure 10.55). Tilted telephone or power company poles are also signs that this type of motion is occurring.

Throughout human history, people have discovered fossils and wondered about the creatures that lived long ago. In ancient times, fossils inspired legends of monsters and other strange creatures. The Chinese writer Chang Qu reports the discovery of &quot;dragon bones&quot;, which were probably dinosaur fossils in China 2,000 years ago. The griffin, a mythical creature with a lion's body and an eagle's head and wings, was probably based on skeletons of ''Protoceratops'' that were discovered by nomads in Central Asia (Figure 11.1).

Another fossil reminded the Greeks of the coiled horns of a ram. The Greeks named them ammonites after the ram god ''Ammon''. Similarly, legends of the Cyclops may be based on fossilized elephant skulls found in Crete and other Mediterranean islands. Can you see why (Figure 11.2)?

Many of the real creatures whose bones became fossilized were no less marvelous than the mythical creatures they inspired (Figure 11.3). The giant pterosaur ''Quetzalcoatlus'' had a wingspan of up to 12 meters (39 feet). The dinosaur ''Argentinosaurus'' had an estimated weight of 80,000 kg, equal to the weight of seven elephants! Other fossils, such as the trilobite and ammonite, impress us with their bizarre forms and delicate beauty.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Explain why it is rare for an organism to be preserved as a fossil.
* Distinguish between body fossils and trace fossils.
* Describe five types of fossilization.
* Explain the importance of index fossils, and give several examples.
* Describe what a living fossil is.

==How Fossils Form==
A '''fossil''' is any remains or trace of an ancient organism. Fossils include '''body fossils''', left behind when the soft parts have decayed away, as well as '''trace fossils''', such as burrows, tracks, or fossilized waste (feces) (Figure 11.4).

[[File:Coprolite.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 11.4''': Coprolite (fossilized waste or feces) from a meat-eating dinosaur.]]

The process of a once living organism becoming a fossil is called '''fossilization'''. Fossilization is a very rare process: of all the organisms that have lived on Earth, only a tiny percentage of them ever become fossils. To see why, imagine an antelope that dies on the African plain. Most of its body is quickly eaten by scavengers, and the remaining flesh is soon eaten by insects and bacteria, leaving behind only scattered bones. As the years go by, the bones are scattered and fragmented into small pieces, eventually turning into dust and returning their nutrients to the soil. It would be rare for any of the antelope’s remains to actually be preserved as a fossil.

[[File:Cliona in Ostrea edulis - Eemian.JPG|250px|thumb|'''Figure 11.5''': Fossil shell that has been attacked by a boring sponge.]]

On the ocean floor, a similar process occurs when clams, oysters, and other shellfish die. The soft parts quickly decay, and the shells are scattered over the sea floor. If the shells are in shallow water, wave action soon grinds them into sand-sized pieces. Even if they are not in shallow water, the shells are attacked by worms, sponges, and other animals (Figure 11.5).

For animals that lack hard shells or bones, fossilization is even more rare. As a result, the fossil record contains many animals with shells, bones, or other hard parts, and few softbodied organisms. There is virtually no fossil record of jellyfish, worms, or slugs. Insects, which are by far the most common land animals, are only rarely found as fossils. Because mammal teeth are much more resistant than other bones, a large portion of the mammal fossil record consists of teeth. This means the fossil record will show many organisms that had shells, bones or other hard parts and will almost always miss the many soft-bodied organisms that lived at the same time.

Because most decay and fragmentation occurs at the surface, the main factor that contributes to fossilization is quick burial. Marine animals that die near a river delta may be buried by sediment carried by the river. A storm at sea may shift sediment on the ocean floor, covering and helping to preserve skeletal remains.

On land, burial is rare, so consequently fossils of land animals and plants are less common than marine fossils. Land organisms can be buried by mudslides or ash from a volcanic eruption, or covered by sand in a sandstorm. Skeletons can be covered by mud in lakes, swamps, or bogs as well. Some of the best-preserved skeletons of land animals are found in the La Brea Tar Pits of Los Angeles, California. Although the animals trapped in the pits probably suffered a slow, miserable death, their bones were preserved perfectly by the sticky tar.

In spite of the difficulties of preservation, billions of fossils have been discovered, examined, and identified by thousands of scientists. The fossil record is our best clue to the history of life on Earth, and an important indicator of past climates and geological conditions as well. The fossil record also plays a key role in our lives. Fossil fuels such as coal, gas, and oil formed from the decayed remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago.

==Types of Fossils==
Fossilization can occur in many ways. Most fossils are preserved in one of five processes (Figure 11.6): preserved remains, permineralization, molds and casts, replacement, and compression.

===Preserved Remains===
The rarest form of fossilization is the preservation of original skeletal material and even soft tissue. For example, insects have been preserved perfectly in '''amber''', which is ancient tree sap. Several mammoths and even a Neanderthal hunter have been discovered frozen in glaciers. These preserved remains allow scientists the rare opportunity to examine the skin, hair, and organs of ancient creatures. Scientists have collected DNA from these remains and compared the DNA sequences to those of modern creatures.

===Permineralization===
The most common method of fossilization is '''permineralization'''. After a bone, wood fragment, or shell is buried in sediment, it may be exposed to mineral-rich water that moves through the sediment. This water will deposit minerals into empty spaces, producing a fossil. Fossil dinosaur bones, petrified wood, and many marine fossils were formed by permineralization.

===Molds and Casts===
In some cases, the original bone or shell dissolves away, leaving behind an empty space in the shape of the shell or bone. This depression is called a '''mold'''. Later the space may be filled with other sediments to form a matching '''cast''' in the shape of the original organism. Many mollusks (clams, snails, octopi and squid) are commonly found as molds and casts because their shells dissolve easily.

===Replacement===
In some cases, the original shell or bone dissolves away and is replaced by a different mineral. For example, shells that were originally calcite may be replaced by dolomite, quartz, or pyrite. If quartz fossils are surrounded by a calcite matrix, the calcite can be dissolved away by acid, leaving behind an exquisitely preserved quartz fossil.

===Compression===
Some fossils form when their remains are compressed by high pressure. This can leave behind a dark imprint of the fossil. Compression is most common for fossils of leaves and ferns, but can occur with other organisms, as well.

==Exceptional Preservation==
Some rock beds have produced exceptional fossils. Fossils from these beds may show evidence of soft body parts that are not normally preserved. Two of the most famous examples of soft organism preservation are the Burgess Shale in Canada and the Solnhofen Limestone in Germany. The Burgess Shale is 505 million years old and records the first explosion of shelled organisms in Earth's oceans. Many of the Burgess Shale fossils are bizarre animals that seem unrelated to any other animal group. The Solnhofen Limestone is 145 million years old and contains fossils of many soft-bodied organisms that are not normally preserved, such as jellyfish. The most famous Solnhofen fossil is ''Archaeopteryx'', one of the earliest birds. Although it resembles a dinosaur fossil, impressions of feathers can clearly be seen (Figure 11.7).

==Index Fossils and Living Fossils==
The fossil record shows clearly that over time, life on Earth has changed. Fossils in relatively young rocks tend to resemble animals and plants that are living today. In older rocks, fossils are less similar to modern organisms.

As scientists collected fossils from different rock layers and formations, they discovered that they could often recognize the rock layer by the assemblage of fossils it contained. Some fossils proved particularly useful in matching up rock layers from different regions. These fossils, called '''index fossils''', are widespread but only existed for a relatively brief period of time. When a particular index fossil is found, the relative age of the bed is immediately known.

Many fossils may qualify as index fossils. Ammonites, trilobites, and graptolites are often used as index fossils, as are various '''microfossils''', or fossils of microscopic organisms. Fossils of animals that drifted in the upper layers of the ocean are particularly useful as index fossils, as they may be distributed all over the world.

In contrast to index fossils, '''living fossils''' are organisms that have existed for a tremendously long period of time without changing very much at all. For example, the Lingulata brachiopods have existed from the Cambrian period to the present, a time span of over 500 million years! Modern specimens of Lingulata are almost indistinguishable from their fossil counterparts (Figure 11.8).

==Clues from Fossils==
Fossils are our best form of evidence about the history of life on Earth. In addition, fossils can give us clues about past climates, the motions of plates, and other major geological events.

The first clue that fossils can give is whether an environment was '''marine''' (underwater) or '''terrestrial''' (on land). Along with the rock characteristics, fossils can indicate whether the water was shallow or deep, and whether the rate of sedimentation was slow or rapid. The amount of wear and fragmentation of a fossil can allow scientists to estimate the amount of wave action or the frequency of storms.

Often fossils of marine organisms are found on or near tall mountains. For example, the Himalayas, the tallest mountains in the world, contain trilobites, brachiopods, and other marine fossils. This indicates that rocks on the seabed have been uplifted to form huge mountains. In the case of the Himalayas, this happened when the Indian Subcontinent began to ram into Asia about 40 million years ago.

Fossils can also reveal clues about past climate. For example, fossils of plants and coal beds have been found in Antarctica. Although Antarctica is frozen today, in the past it must have been much warmer. This happened both because Earth's climate has changed and because Antarctica has not always been located at the South Pole.

One of the most fascinating patterns revealed by the fossil record is a number of '''mass extinctions''', times when many species died off. Although the mass extinction that killed the dinosaurs is most famous, the largest mass extinction in Earth history occurred at the end of the Permian period, about 250 million years ago. In this catastrophe, it is estimated that over 95% of species on Earth went extinct! The cause of these mass extinctions is not definitely known, but most scientists believe that collisions with comets or asteroids were the cause of at least a few of these disasters.

==Lesson Summary==
* A fossil is any remains of ancient life. Fossils can be body fossils, which are remains of the organism itself or trace fossils, such as burrows, tracks, or other evidence of activity.
* Preservation as a fossil is a relatively rare process. The chances of becoming a fossil are enhanced by quick burial and the presence of preservable hard parts, such as bones or shells.
* Fossils form in five ways: preservation of original remains, permineralization, molds and casts, replacement, and compression.
* Rock formations with exceptional fossils are called very important for scientists to study. They allow us to see information about organisms that we may not otherwise ever know.
* Index fossils are fossils that are widespread but only existed for a short period of time. Index fossils help scientists to find the relative age of a rock layer and match it up with other rock layers.
* Living fossils are organisms that haven't changed much in millions of years and are still alive today.
* Fossils give clues about the history of life on Earth, environments, climate, movement of plates, and other events.

In 1666, a young doctor named Nicholas Steno was invited to dissect the head of an enormous great white shark that had been caught by local fisherman near Florence, Italy. Steno was struck by the resemblance of the shark's teeth to fossils, known as &quot;tongue stones&quot;, recovered from inland mountains and hills (Figure 11.9).

While it may seem obvious today, most people at the time did not believe that fossils were once part of living creatures. The reason was that the fossils of clams, snails, and other marine animals were found in tall mountains, miles from any ocean. Two schools of thought explained these fossils. Some religious writers believed that the shells were washed up during the Biblical flood. But this explanation could not account for the fact that fossils were not only found on mountains, but also within mountains, in rocks that had been quarried from deep below Earth's surface. Seeking an alternate explanation, other writers proposed that the fossils had formed ''within'' the rocks as a result of mysterious forces. In other words, fossil shells, bones, and teeth were never a part of a living creature!

Steno had other ideas. For Steno, the close resemblance between fossils and modern organisms was impossible to ignore. Instead of invoking supernatural forces to explain fossils, Steno concluded that fossils were once parts of living creatures. He then sought to explain how fossil seashells could be found in rocks far from any ocean. As in the Tyrannosaurus rex Figure 11.10, fossils resemble living organisms.

==Superposition of Rock Layers==
Steno first proposed that if a rock contained the fossils of marine animals, the rock was formed from sediments that were deposited on the seafloor. These rocks were then uplifted to become mountains. Based on those assumptions, Steno made a remarkable series of conjectures that are now known as '''Steno's Laws'''.

===Original Horizontality===
Because sediments are deposited under water, they will form flat, horizontal layers (Figure 11.11). If a sedimentary rock is found tilted, the layer was tilted after it was formed.

[[File:Horizontal beds.png|frame|center|'''Figure 11.11''': Sedimentary layers that have been deposited horizontally.]]

===Lateral Continuity===
Sediments were deposited in continuous sheets that spanned the body of water that they were deposited in. When a valley cuts through sedimentary layers, it can be assumed that the rocks on either side of the valley were originally continuous.

===Superposition===
Sedimentary rocks are deposited one on top of another. Therefore, the youngest layers are found at the top, and the oldest layers are found at the bottom of the sequence.

===Cross-Cutting Relationships===
[[File:Skagit-gneiss-Cascades.jpg|right|frame|'''Figure 11.12''': Cross cutting relationships: older banded gneiss with a white granite
intrusion. The granite must be younger than the gneiss, because it cuts across the existing gneiss.]]

A rock formation or surface that cuts across other rock layers is younger than the rock layers it disturbs. For example, if an igneous intrusion goes through a series of metamorphic rocks, the intrusion must be younger than the metamorphic rocks that it cuts through (Figure 11.12).

The Grand Canyon provides an excellent illustration of Steno's laws. Figure 11.13 shows the many horizontal layers of sedimentary rock that make up the canyon. This nicely illustrates the principle of original horizontality. The youngest rock layers are at the top of the canyon, while the oldest are at the bottom, which is described by the law of superposition. Distinctive rock layers, such as the Kaibab Limestone, can be matched across the broad expanse of the canyon. We know these rock layers were once connected, which is described in the rule of lateral continuity. Finally, the Colorado River cuts through all the layers of sedimentary rock to form the canyon. Based on the principle of cross-cutting relationships, the river must be younger than all of the rock layers that it cuts through.

[[File:Grand Canyon NP-Arizona-USA.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 11.13''': Grand Canyon, with the Kaibab Limestone visible at the top of the canyon.]]

==Determining the Relative Ages of Rocks==
The '''relative age''' of a rock is its age in comparison with other rocks. If you know the relative ages of two rock layers, you know which is older and which is younger, but you do not know how old the layers are in years. In some cases, it is very tricky to determine the sequence of events that leads to a certain formation. Take the example, Figure 11.14:

[[File:Cross-section of sedimentary layers.png|center|500px|thumb|'''Figure 11.14''': Cross-section of sedimentary layers: (A-C) igneous intrusion, (D) cross-section, (E) fault.]]

The principle of cross-cutting relationships states that a fault or intrusion is younger than the rocks that it cuts through. The fault labeled 'E' cuts through all three sedimentary rock layers (A, B, and C) and also cuts through the intrusion (D). So the fault must be the youngest formation that is seen. The intrusion (D) cuts through the three sedimentary rock layers, so it must be younger than those layers.

The principle of superposition states that the oldest sedimentary rock units are at the bottom, and the youngest are at the top. Based on this, layer C is oldest, followed by B and A. So the full sequence of events is as follows:

# Layer C formed.
# Layer B formed.
# Layer A formed.
# When layers A-B-C were present, intrusion D formed.
# Intrusion D cut through layers A-C.
# Fault E formed, shifting rocks A through C and intrusion D.
# Weathering and erosion occurred, forming a layer of soil on top of layer A.

==Unconformities in Rock Layers==
Steno discovered the rules for determining the relative age of rock beds, but he did not have a good understanding of how long it would take for these rock formations to form. At the time, most Europeans believed that the Earth was around 6,000 years old, a figure that was based on the amount of time estimated for the events described in the Bible. One of the first to question this time scale was a Scottish geologist named James Hutton (1726-1797). Often described as the founder of modern geology, Hutton formulated a philosophy called '''uniformitarianism''': ''The present is the key to the past''. According to uniformitarianism, the same processes we see around us today operated in the past as well. For example, if erosion and deposition occur slowly now, they probably have always occurred slowly.

Hutton discovered places where sedimentary rock beds lie on an eroded surface. Such a formation is called an '''unconformity''', or a gap in rock layers, where some rocks were eroded away. Hutton reconstructed the sequence of events that led to this formation. For example, consider the famous unconformity at Siccar Point, on the coast of Scotland (Figure 11.15).

[[File:Siccar Point.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 11.15''': Hutton's Unconformity on the coast of Scotland.]]

Based on figure 15, at least nine geological events can be inferred:

# A series of sedimentary beds is deposited on an ocean floor.
# The sediments harden into sedimentary rock.
# The sedimentary rocks are uplifted and tilted, exposing them above the ocean surface.
# The tilted beds are eroded by rain, ice, and wind to form an irregular surface.
# A sea covers the eroded sedimentary rock layers.
# New sedimentary layers are deposited.
# The new layers harden into sedimentary rock.
# These layers are tilted.
# Uplift occurs, exposing the new sedimentary rocks above the ocean surface.

Hutton realized that an enormous period of time was needed to account for the repeated episodes of deposition, rock formation, uplift, and erosion that led to the formation of an unconformity, like the one at Siccar Point. Hutton realized that the age of Earth should not be measured in thousands of years, but millions of years.

==Matching Rock Layers==
Superposition and cross-cutting are helpful when rocks are touching one another, but are useless when rocks are kilometers or even continents apart. Three kinds of clues help geologists match rock layers across great distances. The first is the fact that some sedimentary rock formations span vast distances, recognizable across large regions. For example, the
Pierre Shale formation can be recognized across the Great Plains, from New Mexico to North Dakota. The famous White Cliffs of Dover in southwest England can be matched to similar white cliffs in Denmark and Germany.

A second clue could be the presence of a '''key bed''', or a particularly distinctive layer of rock that can be recognized across a large area. Volcanic ash flows are often useful as key beds because they are widespread and easy to identify. Probably the most famous example of a key bed is a layer of clay found at the boundary between the Cretaceous Period and the Tertiary Period, the time that the dinosaurs went extinct (Figure 11.16). This thin layer of sediment, only a few centimeters thick, contains a high concentration of the element iridium. Iridium is rare on Earth but common in asteroids. In 1980, a team of scientists led by Luis Alvarez and his son Walter proposed that a huge asteroid struck Earth about 66 million years ago, causing forest fires, acid rain, and climate change that wiped out the dinosaurs.

[[File:K-T boundary at Starkville South.jpg|frame|center|'''Figure 11.16''': White layer of clay that marks the Cretaceous-Tertiary Boundary.]]
[[File:Geologic time scale.jpg|200px|thumb|'''Figure 11.17''': Geologic time scale.]]

A third type of clue that helps scientists compare different rock layers is index fossils. Recall that index fossils are the remains of organisms that were widespread but only existed for a relatively short period of time. If two rock units both contain the same type of index fossil, their age is probably very similar.

As scientists collected fossils from all over the world, they recognized that rocks of different ages contain distinctive types of fossils. This pattern led to the creation of the '''geologic time scale''' and helped to inspire Darwin's theory of evolution (Figure 11.17).

Each era, period, and epoch of the geologic time scale is defined by the fossils that appeared at that time. For example, Paleozoic rocks typically contain trilobites, brachiopods, and crinoid fossils. The presence of dinosaur bones indicate that a rock is from the Mesozoic era, and the particular type of dinosaur will allow the rock to be identified as Triassic, Jurassic, or Cretaceous. The Cenozoic Era is also known as the Age of Mammals, and the Quaternary Period represents the time when the first humans spread across Earth.
{{clear}}
==Lesson Summary==
Nicholas Steno first formulated the principles that allow scientists to determine the relative ages of rocks in the 17th century. Steno stated that sedimentary rocks are formed in continuous, horizontal layers, with younger layers on top of older layers. A century later, James Hutton discovered the law of cross-cutting relationships: a fault or igneous intrusion is younger than the rocks that it cuts through. Hutton also was the first to realize the vast amounts of time that would be needed to create an unconformity, a place where sedimentary rocks lie above an eroded surface.

Other methods come into play when comparing rock layers that are separated by a large distance. Many sedimentary rock formations are large and can be recognized across a region. Distinctive rock layers, called key beds, are also useful for correlating rock units. Fossils, especially index fossils, are the most useful way to compare different rock layers. Changes of fossils over time led to the development of the geologic time scale.

==Review Questions==
# In the 15th century, a farmer finds a rock that looks exactly like a clamshell. What did the farmer probably conclude about how the fossil got there?
# Which of Steno's Laws is illustrated by each of the following images in Figure 11.18?
# What is the sequence of rock units in Figure 11.19, from oldest to youngest?
# What kind of geological formation is shown in the outcrop in Figure 11.20, and what sequence of events does it represent?
# The three outcrops in Figure 11.21 are very far apart. Based on what you see, which fossil is an index fossil, and why?

As we learned in the previous lesson, index fossils and superposition are effective methods of determining the relative age of objects. In other words, you can use superposition to tell you that one rock layer is older than another. But determining the '''absolute age''' of a substance (its age in years) is a much greater challenge. To accomplish this, scientists use a variety of evidence, from tree rings to the amounts of radioactive materials in a rock.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Define the difference between absolute age and relative age.
* Describe four methods of absolute dating.
* Explain what radioactivity is and give examples of radioactive decay.
* Explain how the decay of radioactive materials helps to establish the age of an object.
* Estimate the age of an object, given the half-life and the amounts of radioactive and daughter materials.
* Give four examples of radioactive materials that are used to date objects, and explain how each is used.

==Tree Rings==
In regions outside the tropics, trees grow more quickly during the warm summer months than during the cooler winter. This pattern of growth results in alternating bands of light-colored, low density &quot;early wood&quot; and dark, high density &quot;late wood&quot;. Each dark band represents a winter; by counting rings it is possible to find the age of the tree (Figure 11.22). The width of a series of growth rings can give clues to past climates and various disruptions such as forest fires. Droughts and other variations in the climate make the tree grow slower or faster than normal, which shows up in the widths of the tree rings. These tree ring variations will appear in all trees growing in a certain region, so scientists can match up the growth rings of living and dead trees. Using logs recovered from old buildings and ancient ruins, scientists have been able to compare tree rings to create a continuous record of tree rings over the past 2,000 years. This tree ring record has proven extremely useful in creating a record of climate change, and in finding the age of ancient structures.

[[File:Growth rings.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 11.22''': Cross-section showing growth rings. The thick, light-colored part of each ring represents rapid spring and summer growth. The thin, dark part of each ring represents slow autumn and winter growth.]]

==Ice Cores and Varves==
Several other processes result in the accumulation of distinct yearly layers that can be used for dating. For example, layers form within glaciers because there tends to be less snowfall in the summertime, allowing a dark layer of dust to accumulate on top of the winter snow (Figure 11.23). To study these patterns, scientists drill deep into ice sheets, producing cores hundreds of meters long. Scientists analyze these ice cores to determine how the climate has changed over time, as well as to measure concentrations of atmospheric gases. The longest cores have helped to form a record of polar climate stretching hundreds of thousands of years back.

[[File:GISP2D1837 crop.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 11.23''': Ice core section showing annual layers.]]

Another example of yearly layers is the deposition of sediments in lakes, especially the lakes that are located at the end of glaciers. Rapid melting of the glacier in the summer results in a thick, sandy deposit of sediment. These thick layers alternate with thin, clay-rich layers deposited during the winter. The resulting layers, called '''varves''', give scientists clues about past climate conditions. For example, an especially warm summer might result in a very thick layer of sediment deposited from the melting glacier. Thinner varves can indicate colder summers, because the glacier doesn’t melt as much and carry as much sediment into the lake.

==Age of Earth==
[[File:Lord Kelvin photograph.jpg|250px|thumb|'''Figure 11.24''': Lord Kelvin.]]

While tree rings and other annual layers are useful for dating relatively recent events, they are not of much use on the vast scale of geologic time. During the 18th and 19th centuries, geologists tried to estimate the age of Earth with indirect techniques. For example, geologists measured how fast streams deposited sediment, in order to try to calculate how long the stream had been in existence. Not surprisingly, these methods resulted in wildly different estimates, from a few million years to &quot;quadrillions of years&quot;. Probably the most reliable of these estimates was produced by the British geologist Charles Lyell, who estimated that 240 million years have passed since the appearance of the first animals with shells. Today scientists know his estimate was too young; we know that this occurred about 530 million years ago.

In 1892, William Thomson (later known as Lord Kelvin) calculated the age of Earth in a systematic fashion (Figure 11.24). He assumed that the Earth began as a ball of molten rock, which has steadily cooled over time. From these assumptions, he calculated that the Earth was 100 million years old. This estimate was a blow to geologists and supporters of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which required an older Earth to provide time for evolution to take place.

Thomson's calculations, however, were soon shown to be flawed when radioactivity was discovered in 1896. '''Radioactivity''' is the tendency of certain atoms to decay into lighter atoms, emitting energy in the process. Radioactive materials in Earth's interior provide a steady source of heat. Calculations of Earth's age using radioactive decay showed that Earth is actually much older than Thomson calculated.
{{clear}}
==Radioactive Decay==
The discovery of radioactive materials did more than disprove Thomson's estimate of Earth's age. It provided a way to find the absolute age of a rock. To understand how this is done, it is necessary to review some facts about atoms.

Atoms contain three particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons are located in the nucleus, while electrons orbit around the nucleus. The number of protons determines which element you're examining. For example, all atoms of carbon have six protons, all atoms of oxygen have eight protons, and all atoms of gold have 79 protons. The number of neutrons, however, is variable. An atom of an element with a different number of neutrons is an '''isotope''' of that element. For example, the isotope carbon-12 contains 6 neutrons in its nucleus, while the isotope carbon-13 has 7 neutrons.

Some isotopes are '''radioactive''', which means they are unstable and likely to decay. This means the atom will spontaneously change from an unstable form to a stable form. There are two forms of nuclear decay that are relevant in how geologists can date rocks (Table (11.1):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width:600px; margin:0px auto 0px auto;&quot;
! Particle || Composition || Effect on Nucleus
|-
| Alpha || 2 protons, 2 neutrons || The nucleus contains two fewer protons and two fewer neutrons.
|-
|| Beta || 1 electron || One neutron decays to form a proton and an electron, which is emitted.
|}

If an element decays by losing an alpha particle, it will lose 2 protons and 2 neutrons. If an atom decays by losing a beta particle, it loses just one electron.

So what does this have to do with the age of Earth? Radioactive decay eventually results in the formation of stable '''daughter products'''. Radioactive materials decay at known rates. As time passes, the proportion of radioactive isotopes will decrease and the proportion of daughter isotopes will increase. A rock with a relatively high proportion of radioactive isotopes is probably very young, while a rock with a high proportion of daughter products is probably very old.

Scientists measure the rate of radioactive decay with a unit called '''half-life'''. The half-life of a radioactive substance is the amount of time, on average, it takes for half of the atoms to decay. For example, imagine a radioactive substance with a half-life of one year. When a rock is formed, it contains a certain number of radioactive atoms. After one year (one half-life), half of the radioactive atoms have decayed to form stable daughter products, and 50% of the radioactive atoms remain. After another year (two half-lives), half of the remaining radioactive atoms have decayed, and 25% of the radioactive atoms remain. After the third year (three half-lives), 12.5% of the radioactive atoms remain. After four years (four half-lives), 6.25% of the radioactive atoms remain, and after 5 years (five half-lives), only 3.125% of the radioactive atoms remain.

If you find a rock whose radioactive material has a half life of one year and measure 3.125% radioactive atoms and 96.875% daughter atoms, you can assume that the substance is 5 years old. The decay of radioactive materials can be shown with a graph (Figure 11.25). If you find a rock with 75% of the radioactive atoms remaining, about how old is it?

[[File:Radioactive decay.png|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 11.25''': Decay of an imaginary radioactive substance with a half-life of one year.]]

==Radiometric Dating of Rocks==
In the process of '''radiometric dating''', several isotopes are used to date rocks and other materials. Using several different isotopes helps scientists to check the accuracy of the ages that they calculate.

===Carbon Dating===
Earth's atmosphere contains three isotopes of carbon. Carbon-12 is stable and accounts for 98.9% of atmospheric carbon. Carbon-13 is also stable and accounts for 1.1% of atmospheric carbon. Carbon-14 is radioactive and is found in tiny amounts. Carbon-14 is produced naturally in the atmosphere when cosmic rays interact with nitrogen atoms. The amount of carbon-14 produced in the atmosphere at any particular time has been relatively stable through time.

Radioactive carbon-14 decays to stable nitrogen-14 by releasing a beta particle. The nitrogen atoms are lost to the atmosphere, but the amount of carbon-14 decay can be estimated by measuring the proportion of radioactive carbon-14 to stable carbon-12. As a substance ages, the relative amount of carbon-14 decreases.

Carbon is removed from the atmosphere by plants during the process of photosynthesis. Animals consume this carbon when they eat plants or other animals that have eaten plants. Therefore carbon-14 dating can be used to date plant and animal remains. Examples include timbers from an old building, bones, or ashes from a fire pit. Carbon dating can be effectively used to find the age of materials between 100 and 50,000 years old.

===Potassium-Argon Dating===
Potassium-40 decays to argon-40 with a half-life of 1.26 billion years. Because argon is a gas, it can escape from molten magma or lava. Therefore any argon that is found in a crystal probably formed as a result of the decay of potassium-40. Measuring the ratio of potassium-40 to argon-40 will yield a good estimate of the age of the sample.

Potassium is a common element found in many minerals such as feldspar, mica, and amphibole. The technique can be used to date igneous rocks from 100,000 years to over a billion years old. Because it can be used to date geologically young materials, the technique has been useful in estimating the age of deposits containing the bones of human ancestors.

===Uranium-Lead Dating===
Two isotopes of uranium are used for radiometric dating. Uranium-238 decays to form lead-206 with a half-life of 4.47 billion years. Uranium-235 decays to form lead-207 with a half-life of 704 million years.

Uranium-lead dating is usually performed on crystals of the mineral zircon (Figure 11.26). When zircon forms in an igneous rock, the crystals readily accept atoms of uranium but reject atoms of lead. Therefore, if any lead is found in a zircon crystal, it can be assumed that it was produced from the decay of uranium.

[[File:Zircão.jpeg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 11.26''': Zircon crystal.]]

Uranium-lead dating can be used to date igneous rocks from 1 million years to around 4.5 billion years old. Some of the oldest rocks on Earth have been dated using this method, including zircon crystals from Australia that are 4.4 billion years old.

===Limitations of Radiometric Dating===
Radiometric dating can only be used on materials that contain measurable amounts of radioactive materials and their daughter products. This includes organic remains (which compared to rocks are relatively young, less than 100,000 years old) and older rocks. Ideally, several different radiometric techniques will be used to date the same rock. Agreement between these values indicates that the calculated age is accurate.

In general, radiometric dating works best for igneous rocks and is not very useful for determining the age of sedimentary rocks. To estimate the age of a sedimentary rock deposit, geologists search for nearby or interlayered igneous rocks that can be dated. For example, if a sedimentary rock layer is sandwiched between two layers of volcanic ash, its age is between the ages of the two ash layers.

Using a combination of radiometric dating, index fossils, and superposition, geologists have constructed a well-defined timeline of Earth history. For example, an overlying lava flow can give a reliable estimate of the age of a sedimentary rock formation in one location. Index fossils contained in this formation can then be matched to fossils in a different location, providing a good age measurement for that new rock formation as well. As this process has been repeated all over the world, our estimates of rock and fossil ages has become more and more accurate.

==Lesson Summary==
Techniques such as superposition and index fossils can tell you the relative age of objects, which objects are older and which are younger. Other types of evidence are needed to establish the absolute age of objects in years. Geologists use a variety of techniques to establish absolute age, including radiometric dating, tree rings, ice cores, and annual sedimentary deposits called varves.

Radiometric dating is the most useful of these techniques&amp;mdash;it is the only technique that can establish the age of objects older than a few thousand years. The concentrations of several radioactive isotopes (carbon-14, potassium-40, uranium-235 and -238) and their daughter products are used to determine the age of rocks and organic remains.

==Review Questions==
# What four techniques are used to determine the absolute age of an object or event?
# A radioactive substance has a half-life of 5 million years. What is the age of a rock in which 25% of the original radioactive atoms remain?
# A scientist is studying a piece of cloth from an ancient burial site. She determines that 40% of the original carbon-14 atoms remain in the cloth. Based on the carbon decay graph (Figure 11.27), what is the approximate age of the cloth?&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Radioactive decay_of_Carbon-14.png|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 11.27''': Radioactive decay of Carbon-14]]
# Which radioactive isotope or isotopes would you use to date each of the following objects? Explain each of your choices.
#* A 4 billion year old piece of granite.
#* A one million year old bed of volcanic ash that contains the footprints of hominids (human ancestors).
#* The fur of a woolly mammoth that was recently recovered frozen in a glacier.
#* A fossilized trilobite recovered from a bed of sandstone that is about 500 million years old.
# The principle of uniformitarionism states that the present is the key to the past. In other words, the processes that we see happening today probably worked in a similar way in the past. Why is it important to assume that the rate of radioactive decay has remained constant over time?

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}
How many years is a &quot;long time&quot;? We often express time in hours or days, and 10 or 20 years certainly feels like a long time. Imagine if you needed to think about one million, 100 million, or even several billion years. These exceptional lengths of time seem unbelievable, but they are exactly the spans of times that scientists use to describe the Earth.

The Earth is {{frac|4|1|2}} billion years old. That's 4,500,000,000 years! Have places like the Grand Canyon and the Mississippi River been around for all of those years, or were they formed more recently? When did the giant Rocky Mountains form and when did dinosaurs walk the Earth? To answer these questions, you have to think about times that were millions or billions of years ago.

Historical geologists are scientists who study the Earth's past. They study clues left on the Earth to learn two main things: the ''order'' in which events happened on Earth, and ''how long'' it took for those events to happen. For example, they have learned that the Mississippi River formed many millions of years after the Grand Canyon began forming. They have also concluded that dinosaurs lived on the Earth for about 200 million years.

Scientists have put together the '''geologic time scale''' to describe the order and duration of major events on Earth for the last {{frac|4|1|2}} billion years. Some examples of events listed on the geologic time scale include the first appearance of plant life on Earth,  the first appearance of animals on Earth, the formation of Earth's mountains, and the '''extinction''' of the dinosaurs.

You will learn about some of the scientific principles that historical geologists use to describe Earth's past. You will also learn some of the clues that scientists use to learn about the past and shows you what the geologic time scale looks like.

==Evaluating Prior Knowledge==
Before you work through this lesson, think about the following questions. Be sure that you can answer each one. They will help you better understand this lesson.

* What is a fossil and how does a fossil form?
* How does a sedimentary rock form?
* In what types of locations do sedimentary rocks form?
* How do you determine the relative and absolute ages of rock layers?

==Geologic Time==
The first principle you need to understand about geologic time is that the laws of nature are always the same. This means that the laws describing how things work are  the same today as they were billions of years ago. For example, water freezes at 0&amp;deg;C. This law has  always been true and always will be true. Knowing the natural laws helps you  think about Earth's past, because it gives you clues about how things happened very long ago. It means that we can use present-day processes to interpret the past. Imagine you find '''fossils''' of sea animals in a rock. The laws of nature say that sea animals must live in the sea. That law has never changed, so the rock must have formed near the sea. The rock may be millions of years old, but the fossils in it are a clue for us today about how it formed.

Now imagine that you find that same rock with fossils of a sea animal in a place that is very dry and nowhere near the sea. How could that be? Remember that the laws of nature never change. Therefore, the fossil means that the rock definitely formed by the sea. This tells you that even though the area is now dry, it must have once been underwater. Clues like this have helped scientists learn that Earth's surface features have changed many times. Spots that were once covered by warm seas may now be cool and dry. Places that now have tall mountains may have once been low, flat ground. These kinds of changes take place over many millions of years, but they are still slowly going on today. The place where you live right now may look very different in the far future.

==Relative and Absolute Age Dating of Rocks==
The clues in rocks help scientists put together a picture of how places on Earth have changed. Scientists noticed in the 1700s and 1800s that similar layers of sedimentary rocks all over the world contain similar fossils. They used '''relative dating''' to order the rock layers from oldest to youngest. In the process of relative dating, scientists do not determine the exact age of a fossil but do learn which ones are older or younger than others. They saw that the fossils in older rocks are different from the fossils in younger rocks. For example, older rock layers contain only reptile fossils, but younger rock layers may also contain mammal fossils.

Scientists divided Earth's history into several chunks of time when the fossils showed similar things living on the Earth. They gave each chunk of time a name to help them keep track of how Earth has changed. For example, one chunk of time when many dinosaurs lived is called the Jurassic. We find fossils of Earth's first green plants from the chunk of time named the Ordovician. Many of the scientists who first assigned names to times in Earth's history were from Europe. As a result, many of the names they used came from towns or other local places where they studied in Europe.

Ordering rock layers from oldest to youngest was a first step in creating the geologic time scale. It showed the order in which life on Earth changed. It also showed us how certain areas changed over time in regard to climate or type of environment. However, the early geologic time scale only showed the order of events. It did not show the actual years that events happened. With the discovery of radioactivity in the late 1800s, scientists were able to measure the exact age in years of different rocks. Measuring the amounts of radioactive elements in rocks let scientists use '''absolute dating''' to give ages to each chunk of time on the geologic time scale. For example, they are now able to state that the Jurassic began about 200 million years ago and that it lasted for about 55 million years.

==Geologic Time Scale==
Today, the geologic time scale is divided into major chunks of time called '''eons'''. Eons may be further divided into smaller chunks called eras, and each era is divided into '''periods'''. Figure 12.1 shows you what the geologic time scale looks like. We now live in the Phanerozoic eon, the Cenozoic era, and the Quarternary period. Sometimes, periods are further divided into epochs, but they are usually just named &quot;early&quot; or &quot;late&quot;, for example, &quot;late Jurassic&quot;, or &quot;early Cretaceous&quot;. Note that chunks of geologic time are not divided into equal numbers of years. Instead, they are divided into blocks of time when the fossil record shows that there were similar organisms on Earth.

[[File:Geologic time scale.gif|frame|center|'''Figure 12.1''': The geologic time scale.]]

One of the first scientists to understand geologic time was James Hutton. In the late 1700s, he traveled around Great Britain and studied sedimentary rocks and their fossils. He believed that the same processes that work on Earth today formed the rocks and fossils from the past. He knew that these processes take a very long time, so the rocks must have formed over millions of years. Before Hutton, most people believed the Earth was only several thousand years old. His work helped us understand that the laws of nature never change and that the Earth is very old. He is sometimes called the &quot;father of geology&quot;.

The geologic time scale is often shown with illustrations of how life on Earth has changed. It sometimes includes major events on Earth, too, such as the formation of the major mountains or the extinction of the dinosaurs. Figure 12.2 shows you a different way of looking at the geologic time scale. It shows how Earth’s environment and life forms have changed.

==Lesson Summary==
* The Earth is very old, and the study of Earth's past requires us to think about times that were millions or even billions of years ago. Scientists use the geologic time scale to illustrate the order in which events on Earth have happened.
* The geologic time scale was developed after scientists observed changes in the fossils going from oldest to youngest sedimentary rocks. They used relative dating to divide Earth's past in several chunks of time when similar organisms were on Earth.
* Later, scientists used absolute dating to determine the actual number of years ago that events happened. The geologic time scale is divided into eons, eras, periods, and epochs.

==Review Questions==
# How old is the Earth?
# Why did early geologic time scales not include the number of years ago that events happened?
# Dinosaurs went extinct about 66 million years ago. Which period of geologic time was the last in which dinosaurs lived?
# Can scientists use the same principles they use to study Earth’s history to also study the history of other planets?
# Suppose you are hiking in the mountains of Utah and find a fossil of an animal that lived on the ocean floor. You learn that the rock that holds the fossil is from the Mississippian period. What was the environment like during the Mississippian in Utah?
# Why are sedimentary rocks more useful than metamorphic or igneous rocks in establishing the relative ages of rock?
# Which is likely to be more frequently found in rocks: fossils of very old sea creatures or very old land creatures?

==Vocabulary==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Table statements can be used to read data from external data sources into model objects, including sets and parameters. Table statements can also be used to write model results back to external data sources.
Drivers are currently provided for [[w:Open Database Connectivity|ODBC]] databases generally, [[w:MySQL|MySQL]] databases specifically, [[w:Comma-separated_values|CSV]] files, and [[w:dBase|dBase]] files.

== Official documentation ==

The [[GLPK/Literature#Official GLPK documentation|official GLPK documentation]] file &lt;tt&gt;doc/gmpl.pdf&lt;/tt&gt; (before GLPK 4.45 &lt;tt&gt;doc/tables.pdf&lt;/tt&gt;) contains a '''full reference''' for the GMPL tables functionality. See [[GLPK/Obtaining GLPK|obtaining GLPK]]. This page only provides pointers and examples.

As of version 4.45 the following information was missing:&lt;br /&gt;
A field name consists of alphabetic &amp;#91;A-Z,a-z&amp;#93; and numeric &amp;#91;0-9&amp;#93; characters and is case sensitive. It does not need to be unique [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-glpk/2010-12/msg00001.html].

== CSV ==
The format for [[w:Comma-separated_values|comma-separated values]] (CSV) files is described in RFC 4180&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180 |title=Common Format and MIME Type for Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files
 |author=Y. Shafranovich |date=October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

For CSV files, the driver identifier is &quot;CSV&quot;.
The table OUT statement completely replaces any existing file.

The CSV table driver has the following limitations built in:
* The number of columns must be less or equal 50.
* The length of each value must be less or equal 100 characters.

The following examples show reading and writing of a CSV file:
&lt;pre&gt;
# test1.mod writes CSV file
set I := {1..300};
set J := {1..20};
set K := {1..100};
param  x{I,J,K} := Uniform01();
table tout {i in I, j in J, k in K} OUT &quot;CSV&quot; &quot;test.csv&quot; :
i, j, k, x[i,j,k];
end;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# test2.mod reads CSV file
set I, dimen 3;
param  x{I};
table tin IN &quot;CSV&quot; &quot;test.csv&quot; :
I &lt;- [i,j,k], x;
printf &quot;Number of values: %d\n&quot;, card(I);
printf &quot;Average value: %f\n&quot;, (sum{(i,j,k) in I} x[i,j,k]) / card(I);
end;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== dBase ==
For [[w:dBase|dBase]] files, the driver identifier is &quot;xBASE&quot;.
The table OUT statement completely replaces any existing file.

The dBase table driver has the following limitations built in:
* The number of columns must be less or equal 50.
* The length of each value must be less or equal 100 characters.

== SQL ==
For [[w:Open Database Connectivity|ODBC]] database connections, the driver identifier is &quot;ODBC&quot;.
For native [[w:MySQL|MySQL]] database connections, the driver identifier is &quot;MySQL&quot;.

Be aware that table UPDATE and table INSERT statements must be followed by a table OUT statement in order to effect the changes (as described in the [[#Execute_SQL|execute SQL]] section).

When using the MySQL table driver, the table statements can make full use of the [[w:SQL|SQL]] commands provided by the connected database.
The MySQL REPLACE statement, a non-standard extension to SQL, implies the subsequent table OUT statement.

=== table IN ===
The table IN statement, in combination with other SQL statements, can be used to select data from a relational database. For instance:

&lt;pre&gt;
set I, dimen 2;
param st{I};
table t IN
  'ODBC' 'FILEDSN=supply.dsn'
  'SELECT product, period, quantity'
  '  FROM stock' :
  I &lt;- [product, period], st ~ quantity;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Instead of a SELECT statement, the name of a table can be provided. In this case the complete table is selected.

&lt;pre&gt;
set I, dimen 2;
param st{I};
table t IN
  'ODBC' 'FILEDSN=supply.dsn'
  'stock' :
  I &lt;- [product, period], st ~ quantity;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The SELECT statement (or the table name) can be preceded by additional SQL statements:

&lt;pre&gt;
set I, dimen 2;
param st{I};
table t IN
  'ODBC' 'FILEDSN=supply.dsn'
  'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS result;'
  'CREATE TABLE result ('
  '  product  TEXT(40),'
  '  period   INTEGER,'
  '  quantity FLOAT,'
  '  PRIMARY KEY ( product(40), period ) );'
  'SELECT product, period, quantity'
  '  FROM stock' :
  I &lt;- [product, period], st ~ quantity;
&lt;/pre&gt;

A SQL statement can be split into multiple strings to overcome the '''100 character''' single line string length limitation in GLPK. In this case, the termination of the SQL statement is signaled by the presence of an unquoted semicolon as the last character of the multi-line call (as shown above).

As of GLPK 4.44, strings are automatically trimmed of trailing space (0x20) chars by the GLPK &lt;tt&gt;strtrim()&lt;/tt&gt; function when using the ODBC and MySQL drivers.

=== table OUT ===
The table OUT statement, in combination with other SQL statements, can be used to insert, update, or delete records in a relational database.

The INSERT statement can be used to insert records into a relational database. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
table t {p in P, t in T} OUT
  'ODBC' 'FILEDSN=supply.dsn'
  'INSERT INTO stock'
  '  ( product, period, quantity) '
  '  VALUES (?,?,?)' :
  p, t, st[p, t];
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the last SQL statement does not contain question marks as placeholders for the values, a table name is expected. This table name and the column names provided will be used to construct an INSERT statement.

&lt;pre&gt;
table t {p in P, t in T} OUT
  'ODBC' 'FILEDSN=supply.dsn'
  'stock'
  p ~ product, t ~ period, st[p, t] ~ quantity;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The final SQL statement that is iterated over can be preceded by additional SQL statements:

&lt;pre&gt;
table t {p in P, t in T} OUT
  'ODBC' 'FILEDSN=supply.dsn'
  'DELETE FROM stock;'
  'INSERT INTO stock'
  '  ( product, period, quantity) '
  '  VALUES (?,?,?)' :
  p, t, st[p, t];
&lt;/pre&gt;

This tactic can be used to avoid duplicate insertions.

It is possible to issue statements other than INSERT. For instance, the UPDATE statement can be used to update records in a relational database. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
table t {p in P, t in T} OUT
  'ODBC' 'FILEDSN=supply.dsn'
  'UPDATE stock'
  '  SET quantity = ?'
  '  WHERE'
  '    product = ? AND period = ?;' :
  st[p, t], p, t;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The DELETE statement can be used to delete records from a relational database. For example:
&lt;pre&gt;
table t {p in P, t in T} OUT
  'ODBC' 'FILEDSN=supply.dsn'
  'DELETE FROM stock'
  '  WHERE'
  '    product = ? AND period = ?;' :
  p, t;
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Executing the SQL ===

At present, SQL support within the GMPL language only allows for SQL commands to be issued within &quot;table IN&quot; and &quot;table OUT&quot; statement blocks.

Within a &quot;table IN&quot; block, the final SELECT statement (or table name) can be preceded by any number of preparatory SQL statements.

Within a &quot;table OUT&quot; block, the final INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE statement, which is iterated over the domain, can be preceded by any number of preparatory SQL statements.

To completely separate the preparatory statement(s) from the database I/O, a dummy output statement can be employed:

&lt;pre&gt;
table prep {i in 1..1} OUT 'ODBC'
  'DSN=glpk;UID=glpk;PWD=gnu'
  # The preparatory SQL statement(s) follow
  'DELETE FROM stock;'
  # The next SQL statement is needed to satisfy the GMPL syntax.
  'SELECT ?;' : i; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Table statement bug (fixed GLPK 4.45) ==
&lt;!-- this information can be removed in due course, perhaps after GLPK 4.48 is released --&gt;

GLPK versions ''prior'' to version 4.45 may encounter a memory overrun error when processing table statements.  The issue is described in this [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-glpk/2010-07/msg00000.html thread] and is now resolved.

Imagine that you had a movie that shows the history of Earth from its beginning to the present day&amp;mdash;as if a giant camera in space had recorded pictures of Earth over the last {{frac|4|1|2}} billion years. How do you think the Earth would look in that movie at different times in history? How do you think it has changed?

If you put the movie in fast-forward, you would see lots of action and lots of change! You would see that our planet has undergone remarkable changes over billions of years (Figure 12.3). Huge mountains have formed, been destroyed, and replaced with new mountains. The oceans have opened up and moved around the globe. The continents have moved around, split apart from each other, and collided with each other, until finally reaching their present locations. Life on Earth has also changed tremendously. At first, the Earth  was not even able to support life. There was no oxygen in the atmosphere, and Earth's surface was extremely hot. Slowly, over millions of years, the Earth changed so that plants and animals could begin to grow. Living things then changed the Earth even more.

[[File:As08-16-2593.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 12.3''': The Earth from space. The Earth looks very different today than it did when it first formed over 4 billion years ago.]]

We often enjoy using our imagination to think about what the Earth was like when dinosaurs roamed around (Figure 12.4). What images come to your mind when you think about the dinosaurs? Now imagine a time on Earth before even the dinosaurs. Imagine the time before any living thing was on Earth. What images come to mind now? How do you think the Earth looked when it was first formed? This lesson will help you understand how the Earth formed, what it looked like during its earliest years, and how life first developed on Earth.

[[File:Europasaurus holgeri detail.png|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 12.4''': The Earth and its dominant life forms have changed throughout the Earth's long history.]]

==Evaluating Prior Knowledge==
The following questions are addressed in other chapters and will help you work through this lesson. Research these before you move on.

* What are chemical elements?
* What conditions do plants and animals require to live?
* What is the atmosphere and what is it made of?
* How do weathering and erosion affect the Earth?

==Formation of Earth and Our Solar System==
We can construct the formation history of our solar system by looking at regions where other stars are forming now. Star formation begins when a giant cloud of gas and dust collapses under its own gravity. As the cloud contracts, it begins to spin faster and settles into a disk-shaped structure. We see these disc-shaped objects (called proplyds) in the Orion Nebula (Figure 12.13), where the new stars are forming today. Most of the dusty disk material drains toward the center where the density gradually increases until the enormous central pressure triggers nuclear fusion reactions and the star is born.

[[File:M42proplyds.jpg|frame|center|'''Figure 12.5''': Orion Nebula.]]

However, a relatively small fraction of the disk material is left behind in the form of ice-coated dust grains. The icy mantles of the grains begin sticking together and eventually grow to meter-sized rocky boulders called planetesimals. The planetesimals collide and accrete into larger bodies that are tens of kilometers in diameter called protoplanets. Once the protoplanets clear a gap in the disk, they become bonafide planets and their orbits begin to stabilize (Figure 12.6).

[[File:Artist’s Impression of a Baby Star Still Surrounded by a Protoplanetary Disc.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 12.6''': An artist's rendition of a baby star still surrounded by a protoplanetary disc in which planets are forming.]]

The process of planet formation is messy. Not all of the planetesimals are accreted into planets. Millions of planetesimals remain as the leftover debris and are now the asteroids and ice-coated comets in our solar system. In the first hundred million years after the formation of the Sun, collisions between the leftover planetesimals and the planets were common. We see evidence for heavy bombardment by planetesimals on the surfaces of the moon and Mercury (Figure 12.7 and Figure 12.8).

[[File:Moon-craters.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 12.7''': The surface of the moon is scarred by collisions with debris that was meters to kilometers in diameter. Most of the planetesimals were accreted into planets or moons, but some of these objects remain as meteors, asteroids, and comets in our solar system today.]]

[[File:Copland crater.png|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 12.8''': The surface of Mercury shows similar collisional cratering. Most of the planetesimals were accreted into planets or moons, but some of these objects remain as meteors, asteroids, and comets in our solar system today.]]

The same types of collisions would have occurred on the surface of the Earth, however erosive processes have erased all except the most recent of these collisions. Pictured in Figure 12.9 is a Meteor Crater in Arizona.

[[File:Meteor.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 12.9''': Meteor crater in Arizona was formed about 40,000 years ago by the impact of a meteorite that was about 50 meters in diameter. Such collisions are rare today.]]

About 100 million years after the formation of the Sun, the gravity of the planets and moons in our solar system had swept up most of the planetesimals. However, millions of these objects still remain in gravitationally stable orbits in the main asteroid belt of the solar system, in the Trojan asteroid belt, or out beyond Neptune and Pluto in the Kuiper belt. Illustrated in the sketch below is the location of the largest reservoir of asteroids in our solar system today (Figure 12.10).

[[File:Asteroid Belt.svg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 12.10''': This sketch shows the largest reservoir of asteroids in our solar system today.]]

Earth is the only object in our solar system known to support life (Figure 12.11). Today there are over 1 million known species of plants and animals on Earth.

[[File:Terrestrial planet size comparisons.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 12.11''': The Earth formed at the same time as the other planets in our solar system about {{frac|4|1|2}} billion years ago.]]


The materials that came together to form the Earth were made of several different chemical elements. Each element has a different '''density''', defined as mass per volume. Density describes how heavy an object is compared to how much space the object takes up. After Earth's early formation, the denser elements sank to the center. The lighter elements rose to the surface. You have probably seen something like this happen if you have ever mixed oil and water in a bottle. The water is denser than oil. If you put both in a bottle, shake it up, and then let it sit for a while, the water settles to the bottom and the oil rises up over the top of the water.

Today, the Earth consists of layers that represent different densities (Figure 12.12). Earth's center is called its core. The core is made of very dense metal elements called iron and nickel. The outermost layer of the Earth is its crust. The crust is made mostly of light elements such as silicon, oxygen, and aluminum. More information on the different layers of the Earth is presented in the lesson on plate tectonics.

[[File:Jordens inre.svg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 12.12''': The Earth is made of several layers that vary in density. The center of the Earth is the core, which is the densest. The outermost layer is the crust, which is the least dense. The middle layers make up the mantle.]]

==Formation of the Earth's Atmosphere==
The early Earth was very different from our Earth today. The early Earth experienced frequent impacts from asteroids and meteorites and had much more frequent volcanic eruptions. There was no life on Earth for the first billion years because the '''atmosphere''' was not suitable for life. Earth’s first atmosphere had lots of '''water vapor''' but had almost no oxygen. Later, frequent volcanic eruptions put several different gases into the air (Figure 12.13). These gases created a new type of atmosphere for Earth. The volcanic eruptions spewed gases such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and water vapor into the atmosphere&amp;mdash;but no free oxygen. Without oxygen, there was still very little that could live on Earth.

[[File:Arenal at night.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 12.13''': Volcanic eruptions occurred almost constantly on the early Earth. Eruptions put water vapor, carbon dioxide and other gases into the air that helped create Earth's early atmosphere.]]

Slowly, two processes changed Earth's atmosphere to one that is more oxygen-rich&amp;mdash;like the one we have today. First, radiation from the Sun caused water vapor '''molecules''' to split apart. Remember that a molecule of water is made of the elements hydrogen and oxygen, or H2O. Radiation from the Sun split some of the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen escaped back to outer space. The oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere. The second process that changed Earth's early atmosphere was photosynthesis (Figure 12.14). About 2.4 billion years ago, a type of organism called cyanobacteria evolved on the early Earth and began carrying out photosynthesis. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and energy from the Sun to produce sugar and oxygen. The cyanobacteria were very simple organisms but performed an important role in changing Earth's early atmosphere. They carried out photosynthesis to produce the materials they needed to grow. They gave off oxygen to the atmosphere as they did this.

[[File:Simple photosynthesis overview.PNG|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 12.14''': Bacteria capable of photosynthesis first appeared on Earth about 2.4 billion years ago. Photosynthesis takes sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water and produces sugar and oxygen. Photosynthesis contributed oxygen to Earth’s early atmosphere and helped change it from one rich in carbon dioxide to one rich in oxygen.]]

Oxygen in the atmosphere is important for life for two main reasons. First, oxygen makes up the ozone layer. The ozone layer is in the upper part of the atmosphere, and is made of O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecules&amp;mdash;a particular type of oxygen molecule. It blocks harmful '''radiation''' from the sun and keeps it from reaching Earth's surface. Without an ozone layer, intense radiation from the sun reached the early Earth's surface, making life almost impossible. Secondly, oxygen in the atmosphere is necessary for animals, including humans, to breathe. No animals would have been able to breathe in Earth's early atmosphere. However, there were probably several types of bacteria that lived on Earth during this early time. They would have been anaerobic, meaning that they did not need oxygen to live.

Very simple cells lived on Earth for the first few billion years of Earth's history. Some of the oldest fossils of more complex organisms are from about 2 billion years ago. They are found in Australia.

Besides changes in life and the atmosphere, other changes have also happened since the Earth was first formed. Early volcanic eruptions on Earth released large amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere. The water vapor slowly '''condensed''' and returned to Earth's surface in rainfall. This formed the oceans. Water began to cycle on Earth, and events like rainfall and storms next began to change the Earth's surface through weathering and erosion. The [[../Earth's Fresh Water/]] chapter gives more detail on how water cycles on Earth.

The continents were in very different locations than they are now. Scientists do not know how Earth's land looked exactly after the planet's first formation. They do know that North America and Greenland formed one giant landmass called Laurentia about 1.8 billion years ago. By about 1 billion years ago, Antarctica may have been close to the equator, even though it now sits at Earth's South Pole. Today, Earth's continents continue to slowly shift around the globe.

==Lesson Summary==
* The Earth formed more than 4 billion years ago along with the other planets in our solar system.
* The early Earth had no ozone layer and was probably very hot. The early Earth also had no free oxygen.
* Without an oxygen atmosphere very few things could live on the early Earth. Anaerobic bacteria were probably the first living things on Earth.
* The early Earth had no oceans and was frequently hit with meteorites and asteroids. There were also frequent volcanic eruptions. Volcanic eruptions released water vapor that eventually cooled to form the oceans.
* The atmosphere slowly became more oxygen-rich as solar radiation split water molecules and cyanobacteria began the process of photosynthesis. Eventually the atmosphere became like it is today and rich in oxygen.
* The first complex organisms on Earth first developed about 2 billion years ago.

==Review Questions==
# Describe how the different layers of the Earth vary by density. When did the materials that make the Earth separate out by density?
# Explain two reasons why having an oxygen-rich atmosphere is important for life on Earth.
# Scientists believe that Earth's ozone layer is shrinking because of human activities and air pollution. What affect might this have on Earth's life forms?
# Describe the role of cyanobacteria in changing Earth's early atmosphere.
# List three ways the Earth was different today from when it was first formed.
# Suppose that the Earth had been much cooler when it first formed. How would the Earth's interior be different than it is today?

The Chief Executive of Otago Polytechnic, the Manager of the Educational Development Centre, and the Director of the [http://www.wikieducator.org/OERF:Home Open Education Resource Foundation] were invited to respond to [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Responses#Questions_with_which_to_focus_the_responses four questions] about open education practices. The questions include topics such as the reasons for the slow uptake of OER in educational institutions, measuring the costs of using open education practices, incentives and rewards, and new models of education. Reference is made to [[Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Measuring_Open_Education|Measuring Open Education]], and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Incentives_and_Rewards Incentives and Rewards]. Their responses are outlined in this chapter.

=CEO of Otago Polytechnic=
Audio recording of Phil Ker CEO of Otago Polytechnic, reflecting on OER at a web conference for [http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Open_Access_Week_2010 Open Access Week 2010]

===The uptake of open education===  
'''Why do you think more than 80% of tertiary educators never use social media in their work?'''

For many institutions this is because OER is simply not understood by the CEO or the senior staff, that is, the decision makers.  This means it does not feature in educational planning.  For teachers (lecturers) uptake is slow for all of the reasons cited in this book; but also because there is a deep culture of teaching as an individual pursuit, and with that a teacher centric approach to learning dominates, with the 'classroom' teacher the number one actor in the teaching and learning play.  For these reasons teachers don’t tend to use other people’s work unless they completely overhaul it, and put their individualistic stamp on it.  In this regard, teachers are their own worst enemies!  They have too much to do, yet they resist collaboration in resource development, and resist reusing existing learning resources without tinkering with them.  This is irrational, of course, but who believes those theories stating that people behave in rational ways?  The answer, I believe, is in changing this underlying culture, and that starts with induction training, extends to professional development, and requires institutional focus as a change management strategy.

It has been rightly pointed out that Otago Polytechnic, in spite of a range of 'enablers' for the use of open education practices and social media, has not yet got the traction we would like.  We believe we know why: we do not have a clear, strong and focused institutional strategy, one as clearly articulated and strongly implemented as our strategy for experiential learning, for building learner capability and for developing work ready graduates.  Nor is it as strong as our strategy for improving educational quality and educational outcomes for learners.  We have woken up to this now, and a strategy for the uptake of OER will be developed and implemented.  The strategy will be developed collaboratively on a wiki; it will have clear goals and objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs).  There will be incentives as well as expectations.  We will measure progress, and review performance against the strategy.  This will work!  I am confident, because it is in the nature of the organisational beast – if you plan it, measure it and reward it, it will happen.

===Measuring open education===
'''With reference to [[Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Measuring_Open_Education|Measuring Open Education]] does the reported cost-benefit analysis motivate investment in staff development in the use of social media?'''

I am not at all persuaded by the calculations presented in this section.  At a conceptual level, the costs, and benefits are, of course, sound; but at the detail level too many assumptions appear to have been made.  Open education practices will be demonstratively beneficial when we see an impact on overall institutional finances, for example, less money invested in course development.  The benefit will be more obvious when our teachers start to report that their workloads are more manageable.  I will back the development of open education because we need our staff to stop reinventing wheels.  We need them to collaborate so that the development load is shared, and so new and different ideas are brought into the mix.  And we need our teaching to be relevant – use of social media is a must, not an option.

===Incentives and rewards===
'''Based on the recommendations made in [[Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Incentives_and_Rewards|Incentives and Rewards]] - What do you think an institution could feasibly do to encourage the use of social media for open education and research?'''

All of the suggestions in this section are sound; but if we want to make progress we need that institutional strategy I mentioned earlier.  The recognition and reward regime will flow out of that.

===Marketing budgets===
'''What do you think of the idea to use marketing budgets more laterally, such as helping teachers to produce open educational media and publishing it through social media channels?'''

Here at Otago Polytechnic we have the lowest marketing spend of all tertiary institutions in New Zealand by a 'country mile'.  And this is because we have been steadily diverting the marketing budget, including using social media.  It is not an either or issue here.  We need to invest in helping teachers produce and publish open educational media as well as maintain a marketing presence through a range of other media.

===New models of education===
'''What new models of education strike you as having the least or most potential in the context of your institution?'''

My views on innovation in education are tempered by the realities of being responsible for a publicly funded institution that has no choice but to charge fees, and to live within the funding which we receive.  So, I park ideas of 'free' education when I am wearing my CE hat.  What I am interested in are models which:
* allow learners to try before they buy;
* improve learner access; and
* enable learners to learn conveniently (e.g., by integrating formal learning with work).

I do believe that we must break our obsession with the notion that content is at the heart of learning.  Content is out there in abundance, but assessing it, making sense of it, and getting value from it is what needs to be focused on.  I am keen to develop a model whereby public institutions such as Otago Polytechnic use a range of strategies.

# Make content freely available; organised around skills or particular knowledge domains; and connect self directed learners to one another.
# Charge a fee for those who want professional help in making sense of the content, or in developing their skills, that is, they need a facilitator or coach. (I know of people who pay $5 000+ a year for their personal 'knowledge' coaches!)
# Charge another fee for those who want to have their skills and knowledge assessed.
# Charge another fee for those who want a credential.

These are four separate services.  They can be offered separately, or in a combination of packages.  The advantage of this model is that it clearly says: “It does not matter how or where you do your learning”.  An approach like this has enormous potential to benefit not only individuals but also New Zealand Inc.  It does need a huge mindset shift, and a change in the policy settings.  I am hopeful we will try this as part of our new OER strategy.  Watch this space!

===The uptake of open education===  
'''Why do you think more than 80% of tertiary educators never use social media in their work?'''

I found the section and references to &quot;teacher disposition&quot; resonated with my experience as a staff developer. More than any other people I have worked with, teachers can be very reluctant to share their classroom - whether that classroom is a physical location or an online one. The ubiquitous experience of an expert (usually old and male!) at the front of a classroom is very pervasive, and is often the picture of education in the heads of both the teacher and the student. The other source of knowledge is an expensive textbook, usually printed in the US or the UK, and often not quite relevant in level, context, culture, or even content. The experience of learning through experience with skilful guidance - in other words, the way we learn most things in our lives - is undervalued.
Tertiary educators often begin their teaching careers as practitioners of their profession, and it takes some time and open-ness to let go of that picture of the sage on the stage as the way to teach. My job as a staff developer is to facilitate the development of the confidence to try unfamiliar ways of connecting with learners, including the use of social media. Many of us know less than our &quot;students&quot; about these technologies, and we need to get off our pedestals to enjoy the process of learning from the learners. Staff developers can provide access to models of OER development that can gently raise awareness and capability, but we often come up against the patch-protection which is a feature of the closed classroom mentality. Collaboration, even within an institution, can be quite intimidating; and the culture of competition between institutions is even scarier. Only actually experiencing the benefits of networking, especially the affirmation of shared understanding, can lead to real collaboration. I'm an optimist - it's beginning to happen, with blogs, wikis, collaborative tools such as LinkedIn and Twitter becoming more widely used by educators. It only remains for these efforts to be incorporated into institutional strategies and for educational leaders to realise the potential of more open collaboration.

===Measuring open education===
With reference to [[Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Measuring_Open_Education|Measuring Open Education]] '''does the reported cost-benefit analysis motivate investment in staff development in the use of social media?'''

This section makes a brave attempt to quantify the benefits of using OERs. This is very difficult, especially the comparison with traditional marketing techniques, but experience tells me that the benefits in terms of teacher workload and increased networking are potentially very significant. However, there are &quot;marketing&quot; benefits, especially in terms of international credibility, that might be difficult to measure but will certainly add to an educational provider's reputation. When this is understood by the leadership of an institution, investment in staff development for OERs will follow - as is the case at Otago Polytechnic.

===Incentives and rewards===
Based on the recommendations made in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Incentives_and_Rewards Incentives and Rewards] - '''What do you think an institution could feasibly do to encourage the use of social media for open education and research?'''

In my view, the most important action that a tertiary education provider can take is to facilitate increased staff confidence and capability in the possible uses of social media in learning. The first step is to make time available to explore these potentials by allowing learners the opportunity to ‘play’ and engage in supported exploration. This can be done as part of &quot;business as usual&quot; in staff development workshops or courses, and also as part of well-defined course development projects.
Another strategy which has proven to be successful is to support &quot;early adopters' to become &quot;champions&quot;. The interest and motivation shown by some individuals towards innovation is laudable, but to be valuable disseminators they will need support and increasing confidence, as well as tangible rewards such as teaching awards or scholarships. Travel grants could be used to enhance contacts made through online networking. Such professional development is a valuable investment to both the organisation and the individual's career path.

===Marketing budgets===
'''What do you think of the idea to use marketing budgets being more laterally spent, such as helping teachers producing open educational media and publishing it through social media channels?'''

Traditional marketing techniques and social media networking are, in my view, complementary and both are necessary. I am particularly interested in the potential for OERs to reach markets that traditional advertising can't. For example, international enrolment by distance has hardly been touched in the area of vocational education. If resources for a particular course are freely available on an open platform such as WikiEducator, they can serve as a &quot;taster&quot; for an enrollable course, or better, as the first layer of a course with tiered engagement possibilities. This is a new model of enrolment being trialled at Otago Polytechnic during 2011 that may well serve as a set of possible choices for learners unsure of future directions, or wishing to enhance their knowledge without necessarily gaining certification. Limited experience to date indicates that a 'toe in the water&quot; may well lead to full enrolment.
Another likely outcome of networking via social media is formal connection at the institutional level, with shared services or international memoranda leading to service provision. This usually arises from credibility built over a long period supported by individual contacts.


===New models of education===
'''What new models of education strike you as having the least or most potential in the context of your institution?'''

It's not so much a matter of new models as an integration of OER into proven models. For example, project-based learning is very valuable for student engagement and real experience, and the important interpersonal relationship here is the teacher as facilitator, designing the learning experience and facilitating the learner's progress. Sooner or later, educational resources are needed - and if these are collaboratively critiqued and developed, freely available in an easily accessible format, and relevant to the project and its context, the full potential of the learning experience will be realised with less cost than by traditional methods. Like most educational institutions, we have experienced and well-qualified staff - but we can all benefit from collegial input, without necessarily losing &quot;ownership&quot; of our teaching style.

=Director of the Open Education Resource Foundation=
The [http://www.wikieducator.org/OERF:Home Open Education Resource Foundation] is located at Otago Polytechnic. Responses to the questions have been submitted by authors of the book.

===The uptake of open education===
'''Why do you think more than 80% of tertiary educators never use social media in their work?'''

Our survey data from the [http://www.wikieducator.org WikiEducator project] indicates approximately two-thirds of new users have not created a wiki account prior to joining WikiEducator. This data would suggest that the majority of educators in the formal education sector have not actively engaged in the co-creation of digital teaching materials on the open web.

The formal education sector is traditionally conservative, and in some respects the reflective scepticism of the academy has contributed to its survival. The university as institution is one of a handful of organisations that survived the industrial revolution and I suspect they will be working hard to survive the knowledge revolution.

While the figures may suggest slow uptake of social media in formal work settings, we should not forget how our 'informal' lives will impact on how we work.  For example, I'm sure that the vast majority of educators consult Wikipedia, albeit in an unofficial capacity and passive interaction with these forms of social media is a step towards integrating social media in formal education settings and part of the development of capability maturity and digital literacies.

Candidly, I'm less concerned about the absolute rates of social media utilisation in the formal education sector - it's a natural capability maturity progression, as long as it moves in a positive direction. I would suggest that the real chasm we need to cross is cultural, namely the shift from 'sharing to learn' to 'learning to share'.

===Measuring open education=== 
'''With reference to [[Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Measuring_Open_Education|Measuring Open Education]] does the reported cost-benefit analysis motivate investment in staff development in the use of social media?'''

Return on investment models are complex, and not without their complications when applied to public funded education systems. Arguably, the return on investment for an education institution should be measured by the attainment of the learning outcomes by its students, and performance indicators like completion and retention rates. It is a difficult research question to compute return on investment based on the cost of staff development interventions in social media using return on investment rationales, largely because there are too many factors to assume causal relationships. The costing model used has not adequately addressed the costing problem associated with fixed cost allocations among differential product outputs. I'm not convinced that the quantifications of 'brand awareness' or 'quality gains' measured by reuse of existing media resources are necessarily justifiable measures of organisational benefits. Perhaps an activity-based costing model with reference to quantifiable outputs may have been a more useful measure for decision-makers contemplating selective investment in OER approaches in their organisations. Also, OER does not necessarily presume the adoption of social media and the costing model needs to take this into account. 

That said, you don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that it is significantly cheaper for ten organisations to collaborate and share the  development costs of an OER course than one institution trying to do this alone. Clearly organisations can save costs and time through selective implementation of OER within organisations. In addition, I think there are considerable benefits for professional development units to utilise OER in the area of professional academic development.

===Incentives and rewards===
'''What do you think an institution could feasibly do to encourage the use of social media for open education and research?'''

I think the suggestions in the book are good ones. In addition, I think organisations also need to recognise the transformational imperatives associated with the adoption of OER. Successful transformation strategies are those which create 'safe spaces' for staff to learn, experiment, and 'find their feet' in rapidly changing environments. Therefore, when implementing incentive and reward structures for the use of social media for OER and research, we should also make sure that we create safe environments for staff to improve their capability, and herein lies the imperative for relevant professional support interventions - hopefully using OER.

===Marketing budgets===
'''What do you think of the idea to use marketing budgets being more laterally spent, such as helping teachers producing open educational media and publishing it through social media channels?'''

Teaching, research and learning is the core business of an education institution. Funding models for OER should be funded by core operations because there is a solid and well-founded reason for doing so. I'm not in favour of utilising marketing budgets for supporting core operations as this would be indicative of mission drift for the corporate marketing departments, and would divert the responsibility for improving quality, reducing cost, and widening access from those departments who are responsible for the core business of the institution. 

When we look back at the history of these inevitable OER futures, will we wonder why it took so long?  In some respects this suggests a leadership opportunity, and leadership comes with the responsibility, namely the responsibility to lead. Those institutions, like Otago Polytechnic, who have taken decisive leadership steps to move forward incrementally with OER adoption will reap the benefits, with the added advantage of gaining tacit organisation knowledge of how to do this through core operations.

===Models of open education===
'''What new models of education strike you as having the least or most potential in the context of your institution?'''

Thinking globally, in a world where the demand for post-secondary education far exceeds the capacity of existing institutions to respond to these demands, we will need to augment our delivery models and approaches. There is not enough money, or time to build enough post-secondary institutions to meet this demand, especially when considering that the percentage of state-funded income for existing institutions has been decreasing over the past decade. I envisage phenomenal growth in both formal and informal learning materials which are open access on the Internet in the medium term. Many learners will choose to learn on their own because they cannot gain access to the formal system, cannot afford the rising costs of tertiary education, or may prefer self- study alternatives. As long as the market places a token value on a tertiary education credential, there will be increasing opportunities for the formal sector to disaggregate its core services of teaching, assessment and credentialising in serving diverse learner needs. OER makes this possible.

*:::I've addressed this already. I'm not rehashing it. The talk page box is not a policy. I guess if we're going to go this route, then all the books nominated multiple times shouldn't be nominated again.  Then we can get more people leaving due to disagreements over material, like Thenub.  That's one way to ensure the community doesn't change. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:12, 20 July 2010 (UTC)
*::::I hope you don't mind that I'm adding asterisks in front of the colons, so that the indentation is clearer. Adrignola, IMHO the community changing isn't the best justification for renomination, as that would mean that the deletion of a page can be based off personal preference; rather, the change in ''policy'', ''standards'' and suchlike will be suitable explanations for renomination. BTW (this is unrelated) Barkingfish, you may want to look at pjoef's talk page at WP, on the message about himself.

* {{del}} as per Adrignola. The issue here is that, while this may be historical, none of the jokes make sense out of context, and the necessary context no longer exists. The only way to make this page useful is to re-animate some of the departed Wikibookians who originally put these things there, and ask them to provide contextual links that would give some relevance to the text.

* [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' I see no reason in principle why there can't be turnover, over time, with the quality and durability of the items gradually improving.  Three of the last four I understand, and would consider of at least mediocre lasting quality; the second to last I enjoyed.  Deletion, the most extreme measure possible, is not called for.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 00:27, 20 July 2010 (UTC)

* '''Very Strong Keep''', per Pi zero and Barkingfish. There is no harm in keeping it; it can always give us a good laugh. Also note that WP's version has motivated the creation of uncyclopaedia, which means these pages can be useful.  And, don't forget, we have essays too, and essays can be humorous. Mind you, Wikipedians should !vote keep, and Pi zero and Barkingfish are Wikipedians, and so am I. :) [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 07:38, 20 July 2010 (UTC)

Sometimes you may want to change the label dynamically from one language to another language without loading the form. In the given example, you can choose the language from the select1 control option.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I bought the Topfield TRF-7160 a couple of weeks back, i must say what a complete piece of shit it is ! for the first week it worked OK then everytime i tried to record it kept coming up recording error, time and time again, really pissed me off , i read the entire manuel and it says nothing about it ! eventually i reset back to factory setting and re formatted the hard drive (this resulted in me loosing all my recordings) anyway it worked again for another week , then the same problems came back , recording error recording error. So yes i tried the factory reset and fe formatiing the hard drive and guess what ? (yes i lost all my new recordings again) but this time it still doesn't work , If i see that recording error come up one more bloody time, it will be smashed through the window of the rip off place i bought it. Ive honestly only owned it for three weeks and im really starting to wonder if its faulty or just a complete piece of garbage.
Please if any one knows how to fix this problem please let me know as it is driving me crazy !</text>

{{template shortcut|LI}}
This template outputs [[w:lorem ipsum|lorem ipsum]] filler text. It takes three parameters: the number of paragraphs to generate, paragraph prefix, and paragraph suffix. There are 10 distinct paragraphs. After this the text will be repeated.

For example, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{BASEPAGENAME}}&lt;nowiki&gt;|2|* &quot;|&quot;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; generates:
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:95%; overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|2|* &quot;|&quot;}}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
Note that whitespace is important in the last two parameters, as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{BASEPAGENAME}}&lt;nowiki&gt;|1| * &quot; | &quot; }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; results in:
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:95%; overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|1| * &quot; | &quot; }}&lt;/div&gt;

== [[Physics Course/Infrared Wave]] ==

Removed your tag of copyvio. The rational is that due to the nature of the edit and because you could have fixed it easely (even if doubt was the reason you could have overwritten it with your own edit) the tag was doing more harm than good.&lt;br&gt;
While I agree with the need to give credit to Wikimedia contributors, there are specific circumstances that makes using the copyvio use problematic and certainly not a reasonable tool to educate users.&lt;br&gt;
If you wish to explore this subject further I'll be available as always.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 09:09, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

: There may well be multiple ways to inform users of best practices. That doesn't make this content any less of a violation of copyright. Please feel free to leave the user a nice message or put this to [[WB:RFD]] but this will have to be addressed. The best way is for the user to ask for an import. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 12:22, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

:: Oh, right. I [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.52.201.184&amp;diff=1694479&amp;oldid=1683765 already did]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 12:52, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

== Noticed this page today [[Wikibooks:Reading room/User:Panic2k4]] ==

Can I move it to my personal space (I will keep it mostly the same), I would when I have time for it link it to the relevant historic logs. If you object then would you mind moving it into yours. I don't think it should remain in the main namespace, especially as descontextualized as it is...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:36, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

: Feel free to copy it, but I believe the topic is relevant to the community as a whole and therefore has a place in the project namespace. It's a pity, but that the user (you) has been the main source of major conflict between Wikibookians. Though the nature of these episodes are regretful, they are certainly part of Wikibooks history. The user is furthermore still active and since the cause of the latest clash went unresolved, there is a chance (a slim one, I hope) that it could repeat itself in some form.
: In that event, some sort of history would be of use to provide context to people trying to mediate. I will agree that it is a pretty sorry excuse for an overview, but the dates and events in place provide a starting ground for anyone wanting to dig into the histories. You are of course welcome to contribute to that history, and I trust you will show restraint in adding analysis. Personal essays, linked to from relevant places on the project page would be enlightening.
: At the time I hadn't been sure if this page was a bit provocative (and thus unhelpful) but seeing how you still felt completely in the right and saw no logical loopholes in your position, I concluded you wouldn't oppose to an unbiased listing of events. I was actually surprised to see your edit summary stating that you hadn't seen it before. I never got around to getting that page to the state I would have thought necessary for advertising it in one of the reading rooms, but figured most people in the debate had noticed it; either when I created it, or when I added it to my user page.
: Just to conclude, this page was not created as an indictment of you or to defame you. After stepping out of the surreal world of the last conflict I started reading up on past conflicts and found among other things what I thought was a very laudable stance taken by a formerly active Wikibookian. He stood tall in your defense and argued that the community should show restraint and not outright ostracise anyone for what seemed to some like borderline delusional behaviour. I agree. I believe the community should accept its responsibility, show sympathy and forgive those dedicated to the project and its aims. If not for your sake, then for our. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:18, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

::If this page should exist, I believe it's a conflict of interest for Panic or any involved in a block of Panic to edit it. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:08, 18 January 2010 (UTC)
::: That assumes there is an interest to be had in this page. It neither is nor should be an indictment. My experience from past conflicts is that we ''can'' agree on the chain of events. As long as we leave the analysis to personal essays in our parts of the user namespace, we'll be fine. Passing judgment and dictating who can do what before the fact is one way to do things badly.
::: That is but one of the lessons we can learn from history. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:51, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

:: My objection is to keep it where it is and in particular to the name of the page (since it pollutes searches I perform regularly), not extremely important but I did think that the page had served its purpose and you would be able to accommodate my requests since personal page should not really be outside of one's userspace (the latitude here depends on the use or interest of the page to the rest of the community and as Adrignola states above the freedom to have the content open for public edits).
:: In any case I'm not attempting to have it deleted nor do I oppose the content (it is something that was already available to all).
:: As for your call me a source of conflict between Wikibookians, I strongly disagree, I never exerted any pressure on others to intercede in my behalf nor engaged in schemes and discussions to cause anyones problems not even engaged in reprisals or in spreading misinformation about other Wikibookians, that sadly has been done to me.
:: As always am as direct as I can. We both know that I'm not the only one to blame why things escalate, like the last block that resulted directly from your own actions (you bet I'm not happy on how you acted). Can you see in any way that the issues created were beneficial to the project or even addressed the problem other Wikibookians were pressing for a resolution (if anything time has proven me right on that request for administrative action) ?
:: What is interesting never the less is that the real reasons I keep being blocked don't conform to proper procedure or even to motives invocated for most of the blocks, this was made abundantly evident in events resulting from first block, and my civil disobedience was vindicated by a poll to the active community and ensuing actions, it was even made more evident on the wording of the statement I was &quot;asked&quot; to agree to for the unblock. 
:: Besides all the bad rap some have attempted to pin on me ultimately, facts and my actions speak volumes. I've never been destructive, or even uncivil but have been given lots of reasons to be distrustful and critical of some administrators and their actions. As for the history I'm very proud to have at least been the one to make several deep changes happen, starting from need to address duplications and even the repel of the fork policy. My main motivation now is to prevent what happened to me to happen to anyone else.
:: We have moved far from the idea that admniship puts people in any control over others and are representatives of the community this shift has lead to real improvement on the project, by the proposed block policy none of the blocks would have been made (and we would be all the better for it)...
:: As for all the Wikibookians that requested a clarification of the events and after observing that all was not right (some stuff was admitted other is self evident) and somewhat defended me (it was not only one) some where directly targets of reprisals for their attempt to be fair, even the ones that kept silent have my respect, the mud and accusations made to me were unreal, just look into RH talkpage if you need your memory refreshed. Things weren't right and to me some are still unclear, I truly don't trust you to be fair to me on anything not because of disagreement, perceptions or speculations but by facts you did me wrong and you know it.
:: Regarding my request do as you see best but yet I don't see a reason for the page to be where it is, and you didn't give any valid justification to preserve it there. You bet it is a bit provocative now, at the time it was created it could be argued to have some reason to be (even if it never was linked to anything as you said), for the timing I see it now as a possible bait for an escalation and further blocks (so you probably shouldn't have placed it there in the first place), that now is the only motivation I see behind the events initiated by your email, as it stands it is extremely out of context, partial and singles me out, in part it does defame me since newcomers to the project aren't expected to understand what has happened but probably view blocks as a negative stain in ones reputation, I did, that was why I strongly opposed the first block (I don't see them like that anymore).
:: So please consider again moving in elsewhere (I even offered to keep it in my userspace), or come up with a valid reason to have it there, my only available option will be bring the issue to the community attention (I hope you see that as unnecessary and unproductive as I).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:34, 26 January 2010 (UTC)

== How to include a book in a Subject Page? ==

Hi Swift, this is probably a silly question, but i cannot figure out how to list a book in a Subject Page, although i've figured out how to put in a Category Page. Your advice would be appreciated. Cheers, PeaSoup 04:07, 19 February 2010 (UTC)

: Use the {{tlx|Subject}} template. [[Wikibooks:Categories]] is your friend. Let me know if these are unclear. Oh, it might confuse you that the subject category that a page is in is listed as a &quot;category&quot;, not a &quot;subject&quot; at the bottom of the page. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 11:35, 19 February 2010 (UTC)

:: Hi Swift, many thanks for the help. It's working now. Perhaps the Subject page updated itself much more slowly than the Category page, so i assumed wrongly that it was not working. Psoup.

::: Good to hear! Let me know if you have any other questions. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:21, 21 February 2010 (UTC)
== Automatic sighting ==

Hi Swift, When i edit a page, it is '''automatically sighted''' by default. How can i correct a typographical error in a page but retain its status as '''Current revision (unreviewed)'''? Thanks in advance. Cheers, PeaSoup 02:40, 22 February 2010 (UTC)

: I think you have to manually [[Help:Revision review|unreview]] it. There shouldn't really be any need, though: Sighting only implies no obvious vandalism, not accuracy. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 23:44, 22 February 2010 (UTC)

:: Thanks Swift. How do i manually unreview a page? Cheers, PeaSoup 02:31, 23 February 2010 (UTC)

::: There is a box titled &quot;Review this revision&quot; at the bottom of pages in the main namespace (ones without &quot;Wikibooks:&quot;, &quot;Help:&quot;, etc. prepended to their title).
::: The odd thing is that my edits don't seem to automatically sight pages and I vaguely remember changing some settings related to FlaggedRevs a while back but, frankly, I've never bothered much with FlaggedRevs which I'm still unconvinced is a positive feature. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:53, 23 February 2010 (UTC)

== RE: Assistive_Technology_in_Education/Proloquo2Go ==

Hi Swift, First, a big &quot;Thank You&quot; for watching over some of the pages my graduate students are working on to fill textbook gaps. Regarding Proloquo2go, I'm hoping you can help me with a mystery. The original Proloquo2go page was created in July, 2009, and it was a model page! I see that it's history now seems to begin on February 20, 2010, and that all (or mostly all) of the original page is gone. As a knowledgeable Wikibookian, how can this happen. I'm sure that you weren't involved because you didn't access the page until the 22nd. I don't think that jCroom gutted the page either, because it would have shown in the history. Any clue? Thanks for you thoughts! --[[User:Sgarrigan|Sgarrigan]] ([[User talk:Sgarrigan|talk]]) 03:39, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

Never mind ... the Proloquo2go page was split off of another page. I found the edit, the edit trail is intact, and the mystery is solved. --[[User:Sgarrigan|Sgarrigan]] ([[User talk:Sgarrigan|talk]]) 04:18, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

: Glad to hear you sorted things out. Let me know if you run into any other problems down the road. All the best to you and your students! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 08:50, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

== Related books here ==

There are a number of books already here at Wikibooks, mostly works in progress, which will overlap with our goals. I did a [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;search=information+economics&amp;go=Go search on &quot;information economics&quot;] and came up with these books (or chapters or sections):
* [[Communication Theory/Network Society]]
* [[The Information Age]]
* [[Open_Source#Economics_of_FOSS|Economics of Free &amp; Open-Source Software]]
* [[E-Commerce and E-Business]]
* [[Business Strategy/Contents/Information and technology driven strategy]]
* [[Legal and Regulatory Issues in the Information Economy]]
* [[Web 2.0 and Emerging Learning Technologies/Digital Divide]]
* [[Communication Theory/Diffusion of Innovations]]
Other searches might turn up other useful material. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 22:15, 27 August 2009 (UTC)

== Problem sets and Textbookishness ==

As part of having this book be a textbook, it seems worthwhile to have problems (and solutions) for each chapter. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 18:41, 30 August 2009 (UTC)

In addition to the problems and solutions, discussion questions may also be useful at the end of each chapter for group settings. These questions could possibly go along with chapter summaries. * [[User:Allegra12|Allegra12]] ([[User talk:Allegra12|talk]]) 20:53, 31 August 2009 (UTC)

In addition it may be useful to show step by step methods in solving the problems from a student or teacher perspective. (contrary to a search engine-derrived solution)* [[User:Jrshepherdiii|Jrshepherdiii]] ([[User talk:jrshepherdiii|talk]])

== Communication Theory/Network Society book ==

In the first section titled &quot;Communication Theory/Network Society&quot; I feel that there should be less on and from Castells. To me, the passage seems like a piece on him or one that is kind of lopsided with only information from him. Maybe try and find more sources that prove the same points. *[[User:NoPasaNada|NoPasaNada]] ([[User talk:NoPasaNada|talk]]) 01:30, 1 September 2009 (UTC)

:NoPasaNada-Those links above are just there to provide references and/or inspiration. I think you're right that we don't want to pull in a huge amount from/about Castells. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 08:27, 1 September 2009 (UTC)

The concept of a &quot;killer&quot; application is important to mention in regards to an information economy.  It can dictate which systems a users buys to run the application.  It is important in creating a network affect.[[User:Econ17|Econ17]] ([[User talk:Econ17|talk]])

== external links ==

Maybe some sort of set of links to sites with good information on similar topics would be good since the point is not to make this book exclusive but to do a good job getting the info out there[[User:ajax8001|ajax8001]] ([[User talk:ajax8001|talk]]) 18:41, 30 August 2009 (UTC)

:I like this idea somewhat, but it appears the standard for Wikibooks is to have them pretty self-contained. My impression is that if we created a lot of links, someone else would want to come along and unlink them. In any case, links during development are a good idea, and we can see about more permanent links as things develop. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 17:35, 10 September 2009 (UTC)

== Task / topic selection (tentative) ==

Please enter here an initial description of the topic you would like to work on for the book project. You may choose any topic from ''Information Rules'', anything we have discussed in class, or anything currently listed on [[Strategy for Information Markets|the book outline]]. You also may suggest anything else which seems important to you, whether from another book, news, or personal interest.

Please also identify the group you intend to work with (by Wikibooks username, not real name).

This is a first, tentative list. We will repeat with a more solid list next week. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 12:37, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

Another thought: If an abstract concept doesn't grab you, you could start with a &quot;case study&quot;-an interesting event, company, product, or whatever. describing what's interesting about that could lead to selecting a topic. (As an example, [[w:Google books|Google books]] is getting a lot of press lately.) [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 17:13, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

I was thinking something like, from the perspective of retail business what are the needs and uses of information[[User:ajax8001|ajax8001]] ([[User talk:ajax8001|talk]]) 19:13, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

For a topic in the book, there should be various graphs with Q and Qhat on the axes depicting the stable and unstable equilibriums of a network as well as emphasizing the importance of minimal critical mass in that chapter.&quot;[[User:Afuller1|Afuller1]] | [[User talk:Afuller1|Talk]]&quot;

AAnderson7, Allegra12, and I would like to focus on one or some of the aspects of e-commerce. We could also be potentially interested in intellectual property. '''(posted by [[User:Tthomas2|Tthomas2]] ([[User talk:Tthomas2|talk]]))'''

I have not had the opportunity to talk and form a group with anyone but I am interested in e-commerce. I think it would be interesting to look into the business strategies/models involved with online auctions and other B2C (Business-to-Consumer) related businesses. If anyone would like to work on these topic send me a message. --[[User:KingKing|KingKing]] ([[User talk:KingKing|talk]]) 06:40, 10 September 2009 (UTC)

I think it is imperative that we discuss the importance of Ebay, a shopping website where individuals in households and store owners can sell goods via internet auction. It will be interesting to discuss how a company can attract consumers of all types who can bu anything with the click of a button. [[User:Jrshepherdiii|Jrshepherdiii]] ([[User talk:jrshepherdiii|talk]])

I agree with jrshepherdiii. Ebay is the most important method in modern internet/economic. Both consumer and company can do transaction without facing each other and by doing the click the button.--[[User:Thesung41|Thesung41]] ([[User talk:Thesung41|talk]]) 04:08, 15 September 2009 (UTC)



It also might be worthwhile to include a chapter on the regulatory and legal environment - a chapter into which the concept of &quot;net neutrality&quot; might be combined. Such a chapter could also include basic information on the FCC and its role, the various pieces of legislation passed in the 1990s relating to online commerce and information economics, and a general list of 'things to watch out for'. --[[User:Evan M. Lisull|Evan M. Lisull]] ([[User talk:Evan M. Lisull|talk]]) 14:09, 10 September 2009 (UTC)

Some of the topics listed previously, such as the regulatory and legal environment as well as e-commerce should definitely be added as vital topics. Intellectual property rights and an &quot;open&quot; business strategies have been and will remain contentious issues. With the spread of the internet, downloading music internationally has the potential to expand potential markets across borders but also bypass many of the nation-level legal landmines. I think expanding those issues and relating them and how they turn out will shape the future of the internet and the dissemination of information since they also go hand-in-hand with various attempts to regulate the flow of information, both favorable and unfavorable. --[[User:Spacedmonkeey|Spacedmonkeey]]([[User talk:Spacedmonkeey|talk]])

I think that from a business and economic perspective of the issues regarding intellectual property rights and regulation of e-commerce, it is a good idea to propose possible changes in e-commerce and information sharing due to the evolution of laws and regulations.  We could speculate what would happen to, for example, the infrastructure of the music information industry if regulations perhaps changed and/or expanded to cover international downloading.  It would be interesting to theorize different possibilities of the evolution of both e-commerce and intellectual property rights and how they are related. --[[User:JJF|JJF]] ([[User talk:JJF|talk]]) 17:52, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
: JJF-This sounds interesting, but I'm afraid it's not appropriate for a textbook. On Wikipedia, what you describe above sounds like &quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Or original research]&quot;. There should be a way to approach it, however. There is a lot of debate about the best rules for intellectual property. Finding prominent contributors to that debate could allow you to frame it as presenting the arguments of others, rather than your own speculation. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 18:31, 14 September 2009 (UTC)

== Task / topic selection (for real) ==

''Now the real thing. Please enter here your group (by Wikibooks username, not real names), and your topic. There can still be some wiggle around the topic you select, but write enough that I can tell you can start moving.'' '''Enter by the night of Sunday, September 13, so that I can look it over on Monday.''' [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 17:18, 10 September 2009 (UTC)

I know that two groups today spoke to me about doing e-Commerce. If you all decide that's still the area you're working on, then when we break out an e-Commerce chapter, I'll ask you to hash out division of labor on the discussion page there. (Feel free to start here, though, if you want.) [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 17:37, 10 September 2009 (UTC)

'''Group D:''' My group consists of myself, AAnderson7, tthomas2, Thesung41 and Jrshepherdiii. We are one of the groups that still wants to cover e-Commerce. I would like to cover the online sector that is used for stock transactions and trade. Others in my group wanted to cover online auction sites, but I am not quite sure what else. *[[User:Allegra12|Allegra12]] ([[User talk:Allegra12|talk]]) 00:34, 14 September 2009 (UTC)
:That is enough for a contribution to the book. You should begin detailing as quickly as possible. Also, remember that you'll be responsible for your contribution ''as a group''. So, for instance, everyone's grade will depend on what's written about online stock-trading. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 12:10, 15 September 2009 (UTC)

'''Group C:''' ???, Afuller1, NoPasaNada, and KingKing. [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Network_Effects|Network effects]], nonspecific. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 15:50, 14 September 2009 (UTC)

'''Group R:''' Spacedmonkeey, Evan M. Lisull, Cjordan18, and JJF are working as a group covering regulation and legislation for the internet. We'll be covering current national and international situations and ongoing events with regard to regulation and lawsuits over information on the internet such as the ongoing censorship battles in Asia, patent enforcement for intellectual property rights and touching briefly on related business strategies and how they might be affected by a shifting legal landscape regarding information on the internet. [[User:Spacedmonkeey|Spacedmonkeey]] ([[User talk:Spacedmonkeey|talk]])--[[User:JJF|JJF]] ([[User talk:JJF|talk]]) 17:07, 15 September 2009 (UTC) We should cover the varied positions and views on intellectual property rights.  We should talk about the proposed approaches to regulating intellectual property rights, and the current legal standards for information goods.--[[User:JJF|JJF]] ([[User talk:JJF|talk]]) 06:56, 17 September 2009 (UTC)



'''Group A:''' jfe09, Econ17, ttc07(forget exact login). we are doing a part of e commerce. We will be doing topics such as Google Adsense and other business models.

For Group A, an interesting topic could be the concept of micro-payments and methods of revenue for websites.  We could compare and contrast micro-payment structures vs. click stream advertising.  We could look at current models and create a gauge of what the necessary number of hits a website needs in order to stay profitable.  Overall, what is the most successful way to make money offer your website.--[[User:Econ17|Econ17]] ([[User talk:Econ17|talk]]) 04:53, 17 September 2009 (UTC)

'''No Group:''Hi im ajax8001 and i have recently talked to tdang about the fact that im not in a group and we decided in wasnt a great idea, i was wondering if anyone would mind me joining one of your groups and i would be happy to make up for lost time..[[User:ajax8001|ajax8001]] ([[User talk:ajax8001|talk]]) 14:33, 25 September 2009 (UTC)

Since no one else has tackled the subject, I would like work on Lock-in. That is, the economic situation the arises from high consumer switching costs. Hopefully I can form a group and work with you, ajax8001, because I d not seem to have a group. As far as Lock-in goes, I would like to look for more modern examples than the antiquated examples in the text book, such as the classic Bell/AT&amp;T system architecture Lock-in. Some more modern examples of Lock-in include cellphone plans and computer hardware bundles. Also, when costs are expanded to include temporal rather than simply monetary costs, the Home operating system market can present considerable learning Lock-in for consumers. Beyond providing modern examples and analysis of Lock-in, I would like to apply Buyer and Seller Lock-in strategies to the models of Lock-in in contemporary markets.

=== refs for network structure ===

* It doesn't have anywhere near complete context, because it's the slides for a presentation without the speech, but this gives a fast run-down on some social network theory:: http://www.slideshare.net/guest59479b/social-networks-sony-guy. I recommend skimming pages 1-56, particularly 51-56 which talks about selling to &quot;hubs&quot;, and then pages 76-94. Conclusions (p. 101) contain useful stuff, but the presentation is all towards running games, so it has to be read with that in mind.
* Via that talk and other places, I have heard the book &quot;Linked : the new science of networks&quot; recommended a number of times, but haven't read it myself. It's available at the UA library: http://universityofarizona.worldcat.org.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/oclc/49827465&amp;referer=brief_results
* I did a Google search on &quot;network structure marketing&quot;, and eliminated references to &quot;multi-level marketing&quot; and got a lot of results-looking through those results might turn stuff up for you, or varying the search terms: [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;q=network+structure+marketing+-%22multi-level%22+-MLM&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N search]

I have only given any of this very brief skims, so my recommendation isn't particularly well informed. Regardless, I'd probably start with the Katona, Zubcsek and Sarvary paper and the book ''Linked''. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 07:35, 13 October 2009 (UTC)

== Review #1 ==

The goal of your review is not to criticize or praise the work so far-it's supposed to be a rough start. Instead, it's to highlight some things which are working or not working to help with the project's development. Make sure you not only say something &quot;needs work&quot; or is &quot;great&quot;, but say what about it should stay the same or be corrected or expanded.

Here's some things to keep in mind:
* How clear is the goal of the writing? Can you tell what the purpose of the section is?
* Given that, how clearly does it approach that goal?
* Are there false starts-things which seem like they should be going somewhere, but don't?
* Are there areas which seem especially interesting to you, and you'd like to see developed further?
* Is there anything which seems to be missing overall? Is there an addition which would add a lot? (case study, theory, pictures, ...)

'''Review 1 on Online Auctions''': The brief introduction on eBay is informative and gives a good background on the company. The section could use some expansion on other online auction sites (although eBay is widely used), and perhaps a little information on specific rules or guidelines that these sites demand. Are there any restrictions to online auction sites? 
Also, keep proofreading in mind as you go, there are several minor spelling errors. [[User:Allegra12|Allegra12]] ([[User talk:Allegra12|talk]]) 01:09, 8 October 2009 (UTC)

I agree with Allegra12. This writing really needs some expansion. All it really gives us is an short summary of what Ebay is and how it works. Maybe you could do more on the history of online auctions, upsides and downsides, or even a side tangent on how consumers are gravitating somewhat towards online shopping. All-in-all, good start. It just needs more to it.--[[User:NoPasaNada|NoPasaNada]] ([[User talk:NoPasaNada|talk]]) 08:09, 8 October 2009 (UTC)

I also agree with Allegra12 and NoPasaNada. About the ebay part, also  I am myself as ebay user. I do sell and buy things through ebay. I want products that with cheaper cost than retailer. However, downside of ebay is that it takes time such as auction ending time and transaction time include shipping. Also, it takes some efforts to be patient until last minutes and focus on the auction. I was addicted ebay first time I was buying it because I would get nervous and excited about it. Moreover, there is transaction fees which cost me quite a few.--[[User:Thesung41|Thesung41]] ([[User talk:Thesung41|talk]]) 15:00, 13 October 2009 (UTC)

Due to the U.S Law, we cannot buy or sell stocks/bonds through ebay.

'''Review 1 on Information Goods and Revenue Strategies''': This page appears to have a strong start on where the chapter is going. The outline along with each section is clear and covers good material. However, although the overview is intended to be brief, it could use a little more depth about what the chapter covers (maybe 2 or 3 more sentences). Also, the cost of information goods section would benefit from a little expansion, maybe with a graph or an example of specific costs when entering the market.

I think the page is great! But who wrote it? All the critiques I really have for it are that I feel the overall focus of the entire page does not have to be completely based on Google Adsense and Micropayments. I'm not completely familiar with the topic so I cannot really give more examples for you to talk about, but I believe it is a strong start! Just wish I knew who wrote it!--[[User:NoPasaNada|NoPasaNada]] ([[User talk:NoPasaNada|talk]]) 08:09, 8 October 2009 (UTC)

&lt;u&gt;
Review 1 Online Auctions&lt;/u&gt;.  I think this is a good basic start.  I think it’s a simple and clear enough example of an online auction.  Perhaps add more details about different online auctions and the different methods they use and advantages for buyers or sellers with these different methods. For example, eBay and Google adsense are good strong examples, but what else is out there and how do they work? What are the specific benefits of this type of e-commerce for both the buyer and seller, and transaction methods?--[[User:JJF|JJF]] ([[User talk:JJF|talk]]) 08:04, 8 October 2009 (UTC)
  
&lt;u&gt;Review 1 Information Goods and Revenue Strategies&lt;/u&gt;.  This section is put together pretty well so far.  You could add in the “Cost of Information Good” section that the initial costs of information goods are typically pretty high and are often sunk costs, which may give first-mover advantages, but may also discourage entry into the market.  Perhaps also in this section, explain that reproduction costs of information goods are typically very cheap.  IN the part about Google adsense I think the explanation is clear and strong, just take out the part that repeats itself word for word in this section.  Are there any other techniques similar to Google’s adsense? Do other search engines do this exact same thing or perhaps a similar idea?  The section on micropayments and microcurrency is put together well, it is very explanative.  I think the structure of having an introduction, information, then a list of general strengths and weaknesses is working really well, it looks organized and reads well in both sections.  Perhaps just expand on the strengths and weaknesses with a little more info.--[[User:JJF|JJF]] ([[User talk:JJF|talk]]) 08:04, 8 October 2009 (UTC)

Review1 on Gathering Market Information:
The introduction seems fairly solid. It provides the reader with a good intro on what to expect in the chapter by posing questions. In this sense it is covered qualitatively. Maybe translate the statement you have in parenthesis into a transitional statement that grocery stores will be used as an example and why this example.

The section regarding collecting data seems sporadic. Points in the beginning seem to tie to points at the end while points in the middle should maybe be in a different point. Perhaps some reorganization of the section to make it flow and read easier.

Also, after the intro paragraph the following sections jump right into the example. I think it would be helpful to describe that section in general first, i.e. why collecting data can help a broad range of firms, then transition into the supermarket example.

Finally, I think an additional section regarding the costs of gathering information would be valuable. Also what about consumer research companies that sell information for firms to use.--[[User:Afuller1|Afuller1]] ([[User talk:Afuller1|talk]]) 22:55, 7 October 2009 (UTC)

Review by Cjordan18	

This piece has an excellent premise and uses examples effectively to illustrate the central argument. There are, however, several grammatical errors and some of the examples could be tied in more closely to the main point. The section of how to physically collect data provides a great example of consumer behavior, but could be expanded further. Some of the main ideas and examples could be clarified. For example, the frozen vegetable example is not explained in an entirely clear-cut fashion. It isn’t obvious how exactly that example ties into the section or the argument as whole, although I see where the writer is going with this example. The introduction is excellent and provides a good indication of what direction this chapter will be heading in. The section on why we collect data could look at the general reasons why firms collect data on its consumers before diving into analysis of specific events or giving examples. Amazon.com would be a good addition to this section as well, as they collect a variety of consumer data which assists them in targeting specific items to certain consumers. This chapter is heading in the right direction and will tie in the central theme of the book nicely.

''Network Effects section on main page and also on second page''

This introduction to the topic Network Effects does a decent job of illustrating Network effects in current Information Economies. However, It would probably be useful to introduce Network effects as &quot;demand economies of scale&quot;. Also, it would help to outline the relationship between demand, consumer utility, and network effects. Finally, in the second page where you discuss Two-Sided platforms, it would probably be helpful to tie in Network effects and the impact they have on 2SP's.



Review by tthomas2

''Network Effects section on main page and also on second page''

After reading through the various sections of Network Effects, I would concur with much of what urconway suggests. I think the introduction can carry more weight than it currently does by emphasizing the scope of network effects through some potent examples. I like the demand structure with network effects page with graphics and explanations. Any chance some concept, especially one that is potentially abstract, can be illustrated with graphs and/or graphics, go for it. In terms of writing a book, a little creativity and visual relief is always welcome. Overall good start, I'm sure this will be a solid contribution to the book.


Review by Ttc1

&quot;Network Effects section on main page and also on second page&quot;

While reading your information on Network Effects, I came across several well written points involving information goods and network effects.  The demand structure page and the two sided platform page both had very useful graphics as well.  The two bandwagon experiment page could use some graphics to help visualize its points like the two above.  There were a few grammatical errors as well but overall this was a very good addition to the wikibook and I believe that your group will exceed all expectations.

I like the use of a credible source to give a good piece of information going forward from here you might benefit from not only analyzing what is stated in the quote but take it a step further and discuss ramifications as well as what decisions might be deduced from that information.. that is regarding online business methods, as for online stock trading sites you do a good job evaluating one example and im sure you plan on doing the same for a few others but it might be a good idea to generalize this topic for people who don't quite think they fall in one specific category so they can see what is beneficial for each type of venue and what different things you may need to consider for the differences in structure and network

* The information found under Online business methods is very useful.  It ties well into my groups section, group A.  These articles give a good overview of market strategies, such as creating a portal, and outlining the basic revenue strategies.  If this section could lead before ours it can tie the book together some.  The weakness are that nothing is formatted or put into your own words.  Both remarks comment that you won't place the excerpts on the wiki book, but you already have. The concept and ideas are there just formatting will help.--[[User:Econ17|Econ17]] ([[User talk:Econ17|talk]]) 01:45, 8 October 2009 (UTC)
* The second section under stock and trade sites could follow as an example of a revenue strategy.  This can help with the flow of the information.  If more detail on the pricing and method could be provided it can help further your idea.--[[User:Econ17|Econ17]] ([[User talk:Econ17|talk]]) 01:45, 8 October 2009 (UTC)
* With regard to the section of Online Business methods, I'm not sure what we're supposed to review. I think the information present is useful in some analyses but, all information written under this heading is noted as &quot;not going to be used in this wikibook.&quot; If the articles and information presented isn't going to be used, then I can't see anything in the section which is reviewable. The information included is useful but needs some explanations and definitions for lay readers who may not be familiar with some of the web jargon. I found most of the information recorded in those excerpts to be fairly technical, requiring at least a certain level of familiarity with the subject matter in order to be of any use. Translating the information into readily understandable terms is a critical step. On a side note, I don't know if what is posted was directly quoted, but reviewing it line by line does show several grammatical mistakes and other minor quality issues. My opinion on &quot;Online Business Methods&quot; is that the section requires significant work to bring it more in line as a textbook to educate those who are not familiar. Breaking up the extended paragraphs into easily navigable segments would do wonders as well as taking a look at some of the other topics being covered in and around the section, allowing for in-book referencing to sections which can cover those topics more in-depth. As a final mention, it has been noted several times that on the actual book, personal notes and signatures should not be used. Overall, this section needs more attention and lot more effort. -- [[User:Spacedmonkeey|Spacedmonkeey]] ([[User talk:Spacedmonkeey|talk]]) 02:17, 8 October 2009 (UTC)
*Online Stock Trading does seem to be a growing field for stay-at-home and other small-time investors. I think expanding some of the introduction to include some description of what has made these virtual traders so popular would make it more useful as a textbook entry regarding ongoing changes to the flow of information via the internet. Another mention is that potential investors should &quot;take time in deciding which site works best.&quot; This begets many follow-up questions. How long do average virtual traders take to profit? What are some of the differences between the many sites and services listed that should be noted? What makes each of them useful or viable in this sort of highly competitive field. There isn't much information posted under this section, so I can't really review it well, but I think there is plenty more to work in. Tying the section into some of the other e-commerce posts, transaction costs, network effects, micro-currency, online auctions and dynamic competition all have relevance to Online Stock Trading Sites. This section has a start, but definitely needs a lot more content.  -- [[User:Spacedmonkeey|Spacedmonkeey]] ([[User talk:Spacedmonkeey|talk]]) 02:17, 8 October 2009 (UTC)

*I think your group has a very good start to online business methods. I like how you found sources that talk a lot about some of the really important aspects of the topics of online business methods. For example how it explains what a portal is and how it links users to information. I think this idea is very important because it is often a key way of attracting people to information. I also like how the idea of B2B (business-2-business) and B2C (business-2-consumer) transactions occur.  I think that it may be possible to develop these ideas a little bit more and talk about how companies benefit from different types of business transactions. Maybe compare the revenue of company how successful it is when it is just a strictly B2B company to the same come is with B2C added. I think it also might be helpful to break up the section a little bit more so that the topics are more clearly defined. I get a little lost reading the information because it runs together a little bit too much. The topics start to get developed but then it jumps to talking about something else. If there were sections it would make the writing a little bit more clear. Otherwise good start. 

*With regards to the Online stock trading sites information I think you also have a good start by explaining what a trading site is. It would be nice to see you develop the idea a little bit more so that it goes into detail about how the sites actually operate in terms of business plans.  I would see if I could find out how and what rules and regulation they have to follow compared with stock brokers that have to go thru actual markets like the NYSE. I would also be nice to see you talk about how the companies generate revenue by operating the sites. Personally I think some of the ways are by taking a cut of winnings/losses or by charging a transaction fee for that trade, or both. I think if you talked and compared these issues to a real broker it might let the reader make judgments about what avenue of investment is best in terms of saving money with small investments. --[[User:KingKing|KingKing]] ([[User talk:KingKing|talk]]) 13:56, 8 October 2009 (UTC)

Reviews by Jfe09-

Net Neutrality- A more technical write up of net neutrality could be included. The examples provided are well done. Provides the pro and con of network neutrality.

Intellectual Property- Very minor grammatical errors, well written and good clear explanations of copyright, patents, etc. 

Collaborative Filtering- Perhaps provide an example of collaborative filtering. A little bit more in depth explanation of collaborative filtering.

Censorship in SE Asia- Well written.




Network Neutrality –
	The path given at the beginning of the topic is clear and provides a good goal. The examples provided (AT&amp;T/Skype/iPhone) help the reader gain a clear idea of just exactly what network neutrality is. Going forward, I think the group should stick to the roadmap and make sure that one thing leads into another so that the reader will not have to jump around the topic to gain the information, but rather the reader should flow through the topic as it progresses. The pro and con examples are clear and set up a good roadmap which should help the group progress into the later topics.

Information Markets/Intellectual Property –
	An introduction to the topic is needed, but there is a lot of good information to provide a solid foundation.  While there is a good foundation, be sure to expand on the material already provided (copyrights/patents) before moving on to new material.

Strategy/Collaborate Filtering – 
	Be sure to talk about ALL strategies before going into detail for collaborative filtering. The information given on collaborative filtering are beneficial and very informative. Be sure to expand on how the information is processed when a user visits a site or makes a transaction. Great start, be sure to provide an introduction on what the reader is going to be learning from the topic before jumping into the sections.

SE Asian Censorship – 
	Well written, provide examples of the censorship (maybe touch on the internet history of China and SE Asian countries) early and often. Great example with the Amnesty International example. Discuss the cause of the censorship as well as the effects the censorship has caused along with what could possibly happen in the future with the censorship and its effects. --([[User:AAnderson7|AAnderson7]]|talk]) 04:52, 8 October 2009 (UTC)

Intellectual Property Review #1

This excerpt provides a clear and concise purpose statement/goal stating the main use of property rights and what property rights actually are. The excerpt provides personal opinions on property rights/definition, as well as formal defintions of what property rights are and how they are used in an organization. While examples were provided of the multiple types of property rights, it couldnt hurt to add more specific examples/situations of how property rights have been effectively utilized. Finally, I felt everthing was properly wrapped up in a somewhat of a conclusion paragraph. With that being said the excerpt contained a clear intro/goal, supporting ideas/examples, and a conclusion. --[[User:Alexc152|Alexc152]] ([[User talk:Alexc152|talk]]) 22:53, 8 October 2009 (UTC)

Material: e-Commerce on the main page: [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Online_Auctions|Online auctions]] and [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Information_Goods_%26_Revenue_Strategies|Information Goods and Revenue Strategies on second page]]

Introduction to EBay is very cursory. Is the goal to discuss auctions in general or EBay specifically? Each of those should go a somewhat different direction in terms of focus.
'''EBay specific'''
# Rules: Description of its various rules, for auctions, for reputation feedback system, and anything else. Particularly interesting for these would be looking at how the rules changed over time and why.
# Competition: What competition does EBay have, both really direct (Yahoo auctions?) and less direct (Craigslist?). How does it compete? Has 1st-mover advantage been decisive for EBay or have there been other features or competitive strategies which have helped it remain dominant?
# Market structure: In terms of course material on costs, network effects, 2-sided platforms, etc. Is the online auction market one where it's inevitable for there to be a single dominant firm?
'''Online auctions generally'''
# Certainly some of the material will be the same, particularly point #3 above.
# But this would be a good place to concentrate on different auction rules and their implications. There's a lot of material on auction rules, and how they work both in theory and in experiments.
# However, due to the U.S Law, We cannot sell or buy stocks/bonds through EBay. --[[User:Thesung41|Thesung41]] ([[User talk:Thesung41|talk]]) 


[[Strategy for Information Markets/Information Goods &amp; Revenue Strategies|Information Goods &amp; Revenue Strategies]] section

'''Cost of Information Good:''' this section is brief enough that it throws me off. If you're going to spend time on costs, I think you need to expand, but I'm not sure you want to spend time on costs? If you're concentrating on '''revenue''', then simply concentrate on revenue. Possibly a note (in a section on revenue) that you're assuming operating costs are low, and so your strategies don't consider the revenue/cost balance that you'd have to in many other businesses?

'''Google AdSense:'' &quot;''Google Adsense is the program that can give you advertising revenue from your website...''&quot; This raises a general style point which we haven't talked about. I think we should avoid the second-person &quot;you&quot; form in the book except in cases where it's really addressed to &quot;you, the reader&quot; (You didn't do anything wrong here, just made me notice something which I'll being up as a general style guideline.)
* This section is a little vague on targeting. Is it more aimed at a business who might like to advertise using AdSense, or a student who wants to understand the strategies behind AdSense?
* Vickrey Auction: Again, I'm not sure how much you'd like to go into different possible kinds of auctions. If you want to explain Google's strategy, then you need to explain why they thought Vickrey was the right auction format.
* Economic Impact: In describing importance, it's vital to disentangle Google's AdSense revenues from it's other advertising revenues (advertising on Google's own pages versus ads placed on others' pages?).
* Strength/Weakness: This summary is a great idea if the material is targeted to people who might want to use AdSense. Will probably want to revisit the exact listings of strengths/weaknesses as the material develops. If it's otherwise targeted, these summaries are over-specific.

'''Micropayments:'''
* &quot;''The idea is to keep these transactions cost minimal, to persuade the consumer to make multiple transactions.''&quot; [[w:transactions costs|transactions costs]] is a term which means more specific things for economists, and so is misleading here. Usually we think of a transactions cost as a cost (likely non-monetary) of conducting a transaction which doesn't get paid to either party in the transaction. It's just friction. The bit, &quot;...to persuade...&quot; is interesting because it's very much a [[w:behavioral economics|behavioral economics]] idea. I would find further development interesting, but it's up to you if that would get you off track.
* Network effects: Network effects are mentioned several times, but it's not clear they're relevant. Or rather, they will be relevant for some and not for others, and it''s not clear how that connects to micropayments. For instance, the [http://www.wsj.com Wall Street Journal] doesn't have clear network effects-I don't benefit (much) when others read the same articles I do. You can leave network effects out altogether, or make the connection. It would be very interesting if you could identify how micropayments and network effects interact (if they do).

'''Microcurrency:'''
I find this topic very interesting. I'm not saying you '''should''' develop it more, as in giving an assignment, but there are a lot of interesting questions about microcurrency: Can it be used off-site? Does it need to have a fixed &quot;exchange-rate&quot; with a real currency (and which one)? Does it create the possibility of money laundering? Can changes to the site (prices of goods) be done without violating implicit promises to those who purchased microcurrency? I'm sure many others.

Generally, the writing in this section is pretty good. There's a few glaring errors (repeated text in a few places), and plenty of smaller errors, but my recommendation at this point would be developing more new material before worrying too much about writing cleanup.

=== TDang Review-Group B ===
Material: [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Gathering_Market_Information|Gathering Market Information on main page]]

This section reads currently as a good statement of intent, but the current material reads as pretty ad-hoc. This is an important and interesting topic. It needs to be handed with well-researched information to be really informative.

Here's some suggestions on how to develop it:
# Specifics will be important, although probably difficult to acquire:  finding examples of how real companies acquired and used specific data.
# Making it most relevant to this course, while it doesn't need to be '''internet''' related, it should be '''information-technology''' related. There are lots of ways this could go, but it should be about something which would have been impossible or much harder in 1970. It could have to do with [[w:data-mining|data-mining]] techniques, for instance, or controlled marketing experiments analyzed with modern statistical technology.
# I know little about this area, myself, so I'm sure there are other ways to develop it which don't occur to me but you can find as you do research. For instance, do firms bin customers into a few intuitive types, &quot;moms&quot; versus &quot;bachelors&quot; versus &quot;party-throwers&quot;, or do they classify customers according to more abstract but also more empirical rules, &quot;number of frozen meals purchased per month&quot;?

[[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Virtual_and_Real_Networks|Virtual and Real Networks]] I suggest leaving this as is for now, and possibly removing it for the final version. It's not bad, but I don't know that it's worth getting into it unless this distinction is applied elsewhere.

[[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Network_Structure|Network Structure]] This hits on a lot of points we've discussed in class, but doesn't clearly get at the issue of network structure (which we've discussed only briefly in class). Mostly when we talk about network effects, we make the network structure abstract so that we only care about the number of people in the network. But in most cases, the users of the product care about connecting with specific other users. I want to be able to call my grandfather and a local delivery pizza parlor, so those add value to the network for me, while two random U.S. phone numbers probably don't add value. The &quot;structure&quot; in this case is something the phone company mostly can't control, but is the [[w:social network]] which exists outside of the phone network. Some businesses can ignore this structure, like we usually do in our analysis, but others could benefit by planning around particular network structures.

[[Strategy for Information Markets/Network Effects]] I'm guessing this material on two-sided platforms is obsolete now that there's another more developed page specifically on 2SP?

[[Strategy for Information Markets/Positive &amp; Negative Feedback]] This is overall a good section, and the concrete examples help. If you could supply some numbers (or graphs of actual market share), that would strengthen the examples. While the text is mostly very good, there seems at some points to be a misunderstanding of &quot;positive feedback&quot;, so that has to be fixed. Positive feedback essentially means that anything gets stronger. That means that a large market share gets larger, but it also means a small market share gets smaller. You have that in part, such as, &quot;''Recall the notion of positive feedback in the sense that it makes the strong stronger, and the weak weaker.''&quot; But there are also bits like, &quot;''Positive feedback can also hurt the competition of the rival company to the one receiving it. Here the product can be seen as failing or inferior to the one receiving the positive feedback and can lead its slow end.''&quot; which gives the wrong impression. Including the picture is good.

[[Strategy for Information Markets/Two Bandwagons]] This needs a bit more clarification. I'm not sure how much you consider this page within your scope, so you can choose to leave it as is and concentrate on other things. I might work on the page more myself, if you don't choose to develop it (please let me know). The goals for the discussion of the experiment are:
* Similar phenomena can appear for very different reasons, so one should think carefully about whether a market is showing an information cascade, network effects, or both when it seems to have a bandwagon dynamic.
* Information cascades can lead to one kind of inefficiency, where essentially everyone makes the wrong decision.
* Network externalities in this experiment had fairly strong network effects, fairly weak taste for variety, and strong (actually complete) individual lock-in. Those features can be used to talk about other important features of real-world markets.

[[Strategy for Information Markets/Demand Structure with Network Effects]] This is mostly very good. There's certainly some polish which could be added, but I think it would be more valuable to extend than polish until later. Some of the norms which I used in class and on the plots (Qhat vs. Q for instance) might not be ideal, and we can discuss if you think it's worth changing them. Overall, this is good. The best extensions I can think of are tying this theory into real-world cases (probably described in detail in a different section, with only brief mention here), and developing the expectations management ideas (again, probably in a different section).
* '''fear, uncertainty and doubt ([[w:Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt|FUD]])''' is part of expectations management-in discussing expectations management, we've concentrated mostly on upside expectations of one's own network. FUD is about diminishing the expectations for a competing network.
* &quot;''This is because the network is now saturated and for some users the value of the product has declined due to the amount of people in the network.''&quot; This is more about diminishing marginal returns than negative network effects. Essentially, it's saturation-the people who are truly interested in the product/network have already joined, and the remaining people just aren't very interested and even some benefit from the large network size isn't enough to draw them in.
* &quot;''The part of the curve where marginal utility = 0, the slope that is''&quot; marginal utility isn't equal to the slope-I'd just take out the reference to marginal utility.

[[Strategy for Information Markets/Two-Sided Platform]] ...
* &quot;''and other consumer driven markets ...''&quot; This last bit of the paragraph is unclear.
* '''Media Resources:''' This one is tricky, because there are potentially 3 sides (consumers, content producers, advertisers), and you need to be clear about how you are analyzing it. Some media companies produce all of their own content (such as most newspapers and magazines), so you can't include &quot;content producers&quot; as a side. Some media operations are fee-based without advertising. Also, while advertisers certainly benefit from more media consumers, it's not clear consumers benefit from more advertisers. Anyway, tricky, so handle with care.
* '''Other:''' This is unclear, are these really 2-sided or one-sided networks?
* &quot;''However, these are other ways to increase network effects and positive externalities. One way to increase network effects is to enact subsidizing.''&quot; I'd rephrase this. Just as lowering price can increase ''quantity demanded'' but not increase ''demand'', I'd say that these strategies can increase the ''network size'' and possibly the ''benefits from network effects'' without increasing the network effects.
* &quot;''The ultimate goal for a platform or market is to maximize the benefits and externalities.''&quot; Usually (we're concentrating on for-profit organizations) the goal is to maximize profit. Often increasing benefits from network externalities can help do that, but not always.
* Overall, this is a really good start, but seems rushed. I would recommend going through carefully, editing both content (taking care to be precise with things like those I mentioned) and writing (watch capitalization, commas, clarity).
* Additions which would help this are specific examples if you can fill in meaningful details: interesting bits about a particular game system, matters of the [[w:browser war|browser war]] relating to two-sided platform competition, and the like.

Material: Some e-commerce on the main page: [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Online_business_methods|Online business methods]] and 
[[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Online_Stock_Trading_Sites|Online stock trading sites]]

[[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Online_business_methods]] I'm not quite clear on how this section will develop.
* First, while I'm clear that there's a large quote from Mahadevan, I'm not sure about the paragraphs starting, &quot;''Based on a qualitative analysis of the Internet based models...''&quot; and &quot;''We argue that a business model...''&quot; Are those quotes from Mahadevan also, or from someone else or original material?
* The quote(s) don't stand alone, and seem to need a lot of support to make sense. You will either need to de-jargonize expressions like &quot;value stream&quot;, &quot;revenue stream&quot;, etc, or provide enough explanation that using the terms makes things clear instead of confusing.
* Do you intend to list Timmers' eleven business models and discuss them? Can you fit Mahadevan, Timmers, Schlachter and Parkinson all into one framework which will make sense?
* I think your main goal for this section should be to describe your goals, then use those resources or any others to satisfy those goals.

[[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Online_Stock_Trading_Sites]] So far this is a well-phrased introductory paragraph (or two), but it still isn't clear where the section will be going. You may find another angle which works, but for the purposes of this class the most obvious approach is to discuss online auctions sites as competitors of traditional trading, and competitors with each other. Then consider what a few of the top sites bring to the competition. Do network effects matter? Is there a first-mover advantage? Are there economies of scale? How much is it possible to differentiate from your competitors? Do different sites use different trading rules, and how can that impact trading?

Material: [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Dynamic_Competition|Dynamic competition]]

[[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Individual_lock-in]]
* Good, precise description of lock-in, and good pointing out search costs. 
* &quot;''Consumers in information economies are especially vulnerable to Lock-in...''&quot; This paragraph is unconvincing. Many information goods are quite durable-they don't wear out, and that '''raises''' the switching costs, since if something wears out I'll have to switch in any case. So, the switching cost of milk brands is low, while the switching cost of AC systems is high. Individual lock-in for information goods can come from their durability (word processing software and game software are technologically just as durable but the word processor is likely to be used for much longer) or from other aspects, such as investment in learning to use a particular product.
* As an aside [[w:Steam_(content_delivery)|Steam]] is interesting in its own right, and was recently [http://games.slashdot.org/story/09/10/09/2217234/Is-Valves-Steam-Anti-Competitive discussed as being anti-competitive].
* '''Hypothetical Example''' and '''Programs intended to create Lock-in''' - these are good sections. A possible extension of this kind of idea would be to develop more on natural vs. artificial lock-in.

[[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Systemic_lock-in]]
* Your overall description of systemic lock-in isn't wrong, but it is unclear. If only a single vendor is available, then there is a kind of lock-in, but it's almost irrelevant since another choice is not just difficult but impossible. In the water utility example, it might well cost more to build a second, competing water utility than that competition would provide in benefit.
* ''Information Rules'' discusses these switching costs as &quot;''collective switching costs''&quot; (as on page 184).
* Systemic lock-in is about difficulty coordinating in a [[w:coordination game|coordination game]]. It would only be worth switching if many others (or everyone else) switched, so individuals aren't willing to switch even though they'd all be better off.
* Example of TI-82, 83 or 83+ calculators: I'm not familiar with these calculators or how they are used in classes. However, the effect you describe, &quot;''they would have to learn to use an entirely different operating system''&quot; sounds more like individual lock-in. That is, a student must decide whether it's worth the trouble to learn to use a different kind of calculator, and that learning time and effort is a cost borne by that individual student. This would be different if classes were organized around those specific calculators with instructors and/or textbooks teaching specifically to those calculators.

[[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#First-mover_advantage]]
* This is a very good start of the section. It needs some polish, and ideas are discussed which need to be fleshed out, but it's a good start as it stands.

I think you could go either of two ways now. You could polish what you have, or you could work to develop more. I've pointed out some things which definitely need fixing. Your writing is good enough as is that it could stand until a later revision. Some further development on dynamic competition could include:
* If you feel able to do so, material actually using game trees would be appropriate.
* Discussing competitive strategies which have come up already: managing expectations, penetration pricing, limit pricing, reputation building, pre-emption...

Material: [[Strategy for Information Markets/Network Neutrality|Net Neutrality on second page]], [[Strategy for Information Markets/Intellectual Property|Intellectual Property on second page]], [[Strategy for Information Markets/Collaborative Filtering|Collaborative Filtering on second page]], [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Censorship_in_Southeast_Asia|Censorship in SE Asia]]

[[Strategy for Information Markets/Network Neutrality]] This is a good start but rough. I'm pretty sure the essence of the important ideas is there, but the writing needs work to be clear. Make sure to work in complete sentences. Since this is a matter of current debate, the two sides of the debate each needs a bit more space, probably after the essentials of what net neutrality is have been laid out, a paragraph for each side should do it? Then a bit describing (as you imply you plan to do) a way for a firm not yet in the argument to decide what would be best for them, and strategies for different kind of firms if faced with a future world with and without net neutrality.

[[Strategy for Information Markets/Intellectual Property]] You have a good introduction to IP here.
* There's a tough balance to strike in being appropriately international. This wikibook shouldn't be just for the U.S. But at the same time specificity is nice. I'd recommend cutting down on U.S. specificity and describing copyrights and patents in a more general way that covers most of how they're handled internationally. But it's reasonable to disagree with me on this, if you want to keep the specificity.
* I would downplay trademarks unless you can find a good way to fit them into a strategy discussion. Trademarks are usually taken as a given, just being about properly identifying each company, and so not a matter of competitive importance. I believe there are cases where firms might deliberately confuse the issues of trademarks and copyrights (Mickey Mouse, for instance) in order to try to get stronger protection, but if you wanted to cover that, you'd need a much better resource than my, &quot;I believe...&quot;
* What else do you want to cover here? ''Information Rules'' chapter 4 is on &quot;rights management&quot;, which is less about the legalities of IP and more about how to best manage the IP you have. That strategic element would fit well with this class.
* An alternative way you could go is highlighting controversy about the appropriate place of IP protection. A strong movement has argued that patent protection shouldn't apply to software. There are a number of more radical commentators who feel that copyright law does more harm than good (one place you can look for comment on this is [http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/forum/copyright/intro.htm here (scroll to the bottom to see links to individual essays)]). John Perry Barlow and Lawrence Lessig have written repeatedly on copyright. Again, there have been heated arguments about patent protection of drugs, particularly AIDS/HIV drugs, with some countries deliberately flouting international patent law.
* &quot;''Unlike copyrights, patents are only recognized in the United States.''&quot; I don't know all the laws in this regard, but there is certainly international patent protection. Almost all the arguments about pharmaceutical patents deal with this-with one nation ignoring drug patents from another nation to copy drugs. You might find some material on international patents:
** http://www.wipo.int/classifications/en/
** http://www.uspto.gov/ip/global/ip_organizations.jsp
** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_Cooperation_Treaty
* I think you need to simplify the writing a bit. Currently some of your phrasing is over-sophisticated.

[[Strategy for Information Markets/Collaborative Filtering]] I don't know if you intend to continue to develop this. &quot;Collaborative filtering&quot; implies by its name a cooperative arrangement among users, and some of its clearest applications are in that voluntary, cooperative mode. The current highest-profile clearest case is NetFlix, where the user enters information about their tastes voluntarily in the hopes that--since others did the same--the system will be able to use all that information to make good movie recommendations. There is a wide range of what can be considered &quot;collaborative filtering&quot;, though, and some of it is more as you describe as targeting advertising. So, technically what identifies as collaborative filtering is that something presented to me (a suggestion or an advertisement) is determined by analysis of what other users liked (or purchased, or clicked on...). There is some measure of this in how Google ranks search results, and how Amazon recommends books to searchers.
* So, covering privacy concerns is only one aspect.
* NetFlix could be interesting to cover now because they have recently finished a contest (and are starting another) to have outside people (mostly academics) improve their recommendation algorithm. Writings about this could provide interesting details on how collabortive filtering is done.
* Fitting collaborative filtering into a business strategy would be a useful thing for this book.

[[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Censorship_in_Southeast_Asia]] Most important: China isn't generally considered part of [[w:Southeast Asia|Southeast Asia]]. Otherwise, this is a good beginning introduction. However, I'm still not sure where it's going and how it fits with this course. It would be good if you can clarify that further. Here's some thoughts:
* '''Technical aspects''' There is a famous quote from [[q:John Gilmore|John Gilmore]], &quot;''The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.''&quot; How does the censorship work at a tech level to solve this (from the censor's point of view) problem? How do users circumvent the censorship technology?
* '''Ethics and strategy''' How to make a decision as a firm about participating in these places? [[w:Google_China#Controversy|Google got a lot of grief]] for how and why they decided to work with China.

== Adding Citations ==

Here's some material on adding citations. First, at the bottom of the page, there should be a &quot;References&quot; section. I've added [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#References|this section]] to the main page. You should add a similar section to extra pages you create. See [[Template:Reflist]] for a little information on it.

One that's added, you can put references in the text of a page like footnotes.

I've formatted a reference on the main page in the [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Online_business_methods|Online business methods]] section. I used the [[Template:Cite_journal]] template to do so. You can see exactly what I entered by looking at the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets&amp;curid=209950&amp;diff=1639702&amp;oldid=1639697 diff] of the change I made. This template is aimed at academic journal articles, and would be useful for any magazine.

The &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite ...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; part formats the text into a fairly standard bibliographic format. The &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=Mahadevan2000&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the beginning and end tell the wiki software to create a reference which will be put into the &quot;reflist&quot; at the end of the article. By putting in &quot;name=Mahadevan2000&quot;, this allows the reference to be re-used without re-entering the whole thing. Putting in just &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=Mahadevan2000/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; in another place in the document will replicate the reference link.

Other templates can be found at [[:Category:Citation_templates]].

As another example, here's a reference to ''Information Rules''&lt;ref name=InformationRules&gt;{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Shapiro||coauthors=Hal R. Varian|title=Information Rules|year=1999|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, MA|}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[Template:Cite book]] template.

And again&lt;ref name=InformationRules/&gt;

== Style guide ==

I'm going to add material here as it occurs to me. These will be style guidelines we should follow uniformly throughout the book. If there is a style guideline you think would be helpful, please propose it here also. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 18:17, 10 October 2009 (UTC)

# '''You''' Only use the second-person form of address '''you''' if it's strictly referring to the reader/student. In other cases, we should use ''one could'' rather than ''you could'' or specify an actor ''the business could'' rather than ''you could'', since we don't want to assume the reader is in the place of a customer, business, analyst, or whatever. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 18:17, 10 October 2009 (UTC)
# '''internet''' Don't capitalize &quot;internet&quot;. This is an evolving standard, different sources use different standards. If you're quoting another source and they capitalize it, leave their capitalization in place. Otherwise, for us the &quot;internet&quot; is lowercase. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|talk]]) 18:17, 10 October 2009 (UTC)
# '''Emphasizing keywords''' This standard ''might'' change as we see how it works out. To emphasize a key word or phrase (something which you might call a &quot;vocabulary word&quot; for the given section), we should '''bold''' that word/phrase ''the first time it appears only''. Otherwise, the word/phrase should receive standard treatment like any other words, not being capitalized or otherwise emphasized.

== Copying material ==

''This is repeated from an introduction page I wrote. You may email me to ask for help in importing material, or follow the instructions linked here to request the import yourself.''

The rules for contributing to a Wikibook here will be somewhat different than those for a typical school paper. Plagiarism must still be kept in mind, but the application is different.

# The most important thing to keep in mind is respecting [[Wikibooks:copyright]]. Don't copy verbatim--or copy with simple re-wording--copyrighted material from most sources, except for '''small amounts''' of material.
# When you do copy small amounts of material, provide a [[Help:Editing#References|reference]] to the source. (References to facts and ideas drawn from other works are also very helpful.)

There are however, exceptions which are particularly relevant here. The above rules would hold if you were considering including material from ''[[w:Information Rules|Information Rules]]''. However, if you were to draw information from a Wikipedia article (such as [[w:Information economics|information economics]]), you are allowed, if you like, to copy large amounts of material, provided you do so in the right way. If you felt that that page was particularly valuable, you could copy the whole thing into a chapter of the book as a starting point. This wouldn't be violating the copyright because the page is available under a [[w:copyleft|copyleft]] license (specifically the [[Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License|Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0]] license), which gives you the right to do so.

The material from Wikipedia is still copyrighted as well as copylefted, so there's a special way to put it into a wikibook. Instead of just copying the text, you [[WB:RFI|request the page to be imported]]. This gets a little complicated. If you decide you want to do this, communicate with me and we'll figure it out together.

Regardless of the source of your material, this is a '''class''' project, and for the sake of academic honesty, I will want it to be clear when you include external material. If you think it's helpful to creating the book, by all means, copy material which you can legitimately copy. I ask that you make a note of when you do so, however. You can do that by putting a comment in the article's talk page noting where the material originated. Alternatively, you can link to the original source in the [[Using_Wikibooks/How_To_Edit_A_Wikibook#Edit_Summaries|edit summary]].

== Review #2 ==
As with review #1, the goal of your review is not to criticize or praise the work so far. Instead, it's to highlight some things which are working or not working to help with the project's development. The work should be more developed than at review #1, so your review should reflect that-you can be more picky, but you should also assume there won't be huge changes in direction between now and the final version.

Reviewers: [[User:Afuller1]], [[User:tthomas2]], [[User:KingKing]]


afuller1: For revenue strategies, if the introduction were longer or provided more of what was to come rather then just immediately jumping into google adsense. Also there is a section of sentences repeated in the google adsense section. Related to that as well, some sentences seem to repeat more of what was already stated without really developing the idea/concept further. Perhaps developing why the strengths are related to google adsense. It isn't real clear how the bullet points relate.
All in all, i think the content is good, but just needs some cleaning up and expanding.

For the e-commerce and online auctions on the main page, the only real suggestion I have is to do some format/organization work on it so it is more reader friendly.


Your group’s contributions to the book are looking great. I went back and looked at what you originally had before this second review and it appears that you refined you writings some. I can see that you clarified many of the ideas and even added more useful information to your topics. I still think that you can make everything a little more crisp by cleaning it up just a little more. Some of the information seems like it can be organized better and expanded on a little bit.  I like how the information goods and revenue strategies is broken up. I t makes everything clear and easy to follow. Good work everybody.

Jfe09- The network effects section has good examples of successful network effects. Could go into detail into how money is made off advertising with these examples.
The two sided platform could use an example of a successful two sided platform and an unsuccessful two side platform and why each happened to be successful/unsuccessful. 
Good explanation of what positive and negative feedback are. The differences between positive and negative feedback are well defined. Good example of the ipods and napster. Each show how feedback works. The tipsiness’ part of the review is well done; however the part about Blu Ray and HD DVD could be a little bit more in depth.  
The two bandwagon example shows ties to together class and the project. Perhaps there is another example that could be used. A more in depth relationship between the herding and network effects could be done. 
Demand structure very good. Very in depth.
Two sided platforms does a good job of explaining the concept.

For online business methods this section is very strong and informative, but perhaps could be whittled down a bit and more generally brief but still as informative.  I think this whole section reads pretty well, i would recommend though to make sure it reads as if it is addressed to a text book reader.  The introductions and explanations of the different streams and aspects of online business are great, maybe just throw an example in the mix here and there to further illustrate what you are explaining.  I like the part about the Norwegian economists, this kind of material is interesting and can help demonstrate examples of what your explaining or they can help show some interesting notes about what your explaining.  The online stock trading sites page is great, i really like the organization and clarity.  Good use of examples and illustration of points.  maybe talk about other possible strategies these online sites can implement (specifically in cost structure) in order to gain higher market share.--[[User:JJF|JJF]] ([[User talk:JJF|talk]]) 07:01, 17 November 2009 (UTC)


For the Online Business Methods section, I understand that the majority of the information you have posted is just a block quote from the literature you intend to do a further analysis. I believe this section can be broken down and explained more and more, clear-cut examples should be given to help the reader understand this subject you are trying to convey. This section seems like it holds a great amount of information that you can use well, but I really think you should start actually writing your section before it is under review.
The Online Stocks and Trading Page was very well put together. The explanations were almost all very clear-cut and you good examples to go along with the subject matter you were trying to explain. The only real criticism I have is where did you get all of you information? Are you going to site anything in this section? Great job for whoever did this page!

AJAX8001- I think what is down is solid but seems to not be enough to really delve into the topic. Maybe talk about how to achieve lock in in certain industries in which it might be competitive to do so. Also you can talk about the link between network effects and lock in, specifically about achieving critical mass. That would seem to tie in to this book well.
The first mover advantage is a good topic to talk about but id like to know how to keep this advantage after the other players enter the industry, how can we sustain this advantage. you might also want to consider cleaning up the parts talking about the specific advantages to being the first mover as it is a little unclear. bullet points might help

-  Fairly well put together for ease of understanding. The topic does seem a bit light and shallow, but there is plenty of room to flesh it out. Definitely though, double check for spelling and grammar. Numerous mistakes spread throughout. Is it possible to give an example of &quot;first mover&quot; advantage actually being &quot;last mover,&quot; since that seems to be contrary to the definition. On that note, check your definitions! Free rider problem is something completely different than first-mover. I've never heard of bleeding edge... how widely is it known?? Try to avoid some of the folksy sayings, they may get the point across using layman terms, but they're for a highly selective group, as in they won't make sense to people in any other culture. Some of the examples are good but, do you want to have subsections that are only a few lines when a new paragraph might work just as well? Overall fairly good, a bit shallow and doesn't show much in the way of editing... Needs more work. [[User:Spacedmonkeey|Spacedmonkeey]]([[User talk:Spacedmonkeey|talk]])

The second page for net neutrality proposes a good outline of questions for the topic. Although it may need some more depth in the responses, I think it is headed in a good direction.  I think an interesting question to cover is how net neutrality affects information markets. When did the concept of net neutrality begin and why? These few questions could add more interesting thoughts to this page.  The second page for intellectual property looks well developed and written. Maybe a few more examples of intellectual property issues or any popular examples from the past could expand the page a bit if you feel it’s necessary. The collaborative filtering page needs some expansion, perhaps more clarity in where the topic is going. I am interested in reading more about each of the types of collaborative filtering, especially some examples. The beginning of censorship in SE Asia has a good start and is an interesting topic. Besides more depth, this is a good section and I am looking forward to reading about the regulations in China and India. Overall, these pages are making great progress and cover some appealing concepts. The focus from this review should revolve around more expansion and some added examples to explain each topic a bit better. [[User:Allegra12|Allegra12]] ([[User talk:Allegra12|talk]]) 03:55, 17 November 2009 (UTC)

Thesung41 - 
I am not trying to be nitpicky in regards to this paragraph. There is some truth to this. However, there are some factual discrepancies. For instance, the definition of censorship in Southeast Asia is wrong because of the geographical technicality of China. China is located in East Asia and India in South Asia; these two countries are not part of Southeast Asia. If you want to talk about censorship in Southeast Asia, you should mention the countries Burma (Myanmar) and Laos. Burma and Laos are the exclusively communist and naturally has censorship. That would make it valid. However if you want to talk about China and India, I would suggest changing the title to “Censorship in Asia” or “Censorship in China.” Another problem in talking about censorship, especially digital, electronic censorship, is the fact that the countries of Burma and Laos have a low computer user to overall population ratio; that is, there aren’t a lot of computer users to be had in those countries anyway. Those were the only major discrepancies I picked up. I would like to say, however, that overall the paragraph flowed together and that it was well written in trying to get the point across. The factual evidence of China’s economic growth and its firewall project are some truthful points.

Material: e-Commerce on the main page: [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Online_Auctions|Online auctions]] and [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Information_Goods_%26_Revenue_Strategies|Information Goods and Revenue Strategies on second page]]

It looks like everything for your group is now at [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Information_Goods_%26_Revenue_Strategies|this page]]. Is that correct?

# &quot;''The difficulties for providers come when trying to implement a payment system for the information. For the information goods consumer, the internet allows a coordination game to be played. Consumers want to meet a equilibrium network and price. For most information goods such as news, this price is zero.''&quot; I think you've squeezed a lot into these few sentences. You may well want to expand-what's the nature of the coordination game? Is it a game where it's hard to coordinate on a good outcome? (In some coordination games it's pretty easy to get the good outcome.) The last sentence, &quot;''For most information goods...''&quot; seems to be talking about something different, about revenue for online goods rather than about selecting the payment method. It should probably be separate.
# '''Mircropayments''' micropayments may or may not wind up being important for online commerce. It's not clear that there's any necessary connection between micropayments and network effects. You should make clear the connection you have in mind, or (I suggest) talk about micropayments without getting into network effects. Your examples (Public transport, Gift-card, University meal plans, ITunes, ESPN, Online multiplayer games) are still useful without trying to tie them into the networks idea.
# That said, one of the issues for micropayments is whether different sites should each manage their own microcurrency, or whether there should be one or more microcurrencies usable across many sites. This is a matter for network effects, specifically for a micropayment system as a two-sided platform, like a credit card, and that ties into the coordination issue.
# Here's a question I don't have the answer to, just thinking: Some newspapers (Tucson Weekly, for instance) are distributed for free and entirely ad-supported. Others (and this seems to apply to the &quot;serious&quot; newspapers both national and local) charge a low fee for the paper, but make most of their money on advertising. Why have these latter newspapers NOT traditionally given away the newspaper and made all of their money on advertising? Could their reasons illuminate the online pricing models at all?
# '''Business Models''' I'm going to (temporarily) cut this stuff out. You can go back using the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Information_Goods_%26_Revenue_Strategies&amp;action=history history] link for the page to recover it. I'm going to cut it out because I think it's too verbatim to be used safely right now. If you're going to use these, credit Van Alstyne with the ideas, but re-describe them yourself (and expand).

Overall, I'm afraid you need a lot more. Here's a couple suggestions:
# Sometimes your wording is confusing. It might be that going back through and cleaning up the wording (which will sometimes mean expanding) will also help make it clear what should be further developed. This is a place to use the fact that you're working in a group. Often when I write something, my wording is excellently clear, until someone else reads it and they have no idea what I'm trying to say. Make sure that the different group members understand what's being said.
# It looks like you're having trouble deciding how to develop the section. The link to discussion on micropayments might be a great place to work from. It shouldn't be your sole source, but if you go through and pick out some of the main points of each commenter, then those points can frame what you should write.
# If you're trying to identify successful and unsuccessful business models, look for successful and failed businesses. Find some businesses which are interesting to you, and have succeeded or failed online, and discuss their specific business models.

Material: [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Gathering_Market_Information|Gathering Market Information on main page]]

I broke your material up into Wiki-recognized sections (see [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets&amp;diff=1662576&amp;oldid=1662575 this diff]). Please verify that the sections are the way you intended?

This is good, and pretty complete, as an outline for the section. What it still needs is referenced material, real-world examples, and more detail.
# Referenced material: This still reads as mostly well-thought-out but also off-the-cuff analysis. It needs useful material referenced to other scholars, or news articles, business or IT magazines, or something to give it weight.
# Real-world examples: Generalities are good because they can apply broadly, but specific examples provide more context to really understand the generalities. These specifics might be hard to find, but hopefully some will appear in references.
# Detail: What kind of data is collected and how is it used? How is the data analyzed? A mass of data is still just a mass of data before analysis, and you haven't yet described what could be done with it to make it meaningful.

I'd also consider how to avoid erroneous analysis, and the possibility of doing actual experiments. David Reiley presented material in class on experiments he ran at Yahoo, combining online and retail data. He also described how some data analysis can be very misleading if done wrong. This kind of thing would be helpful. (A description of his project is [http://research.yahoo.com/project/2616 here].)

Material: [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Network_Effects|Network Effects section on main page]] and [[Strategy for Information Markets/Network Effects|also on second page]], [[Strategy for Information Markets/Positive &amp; Negative Feedback|Positive &amp; Negative Feedback on second page]], [[Strategy for Information Markets/Two Bandwagons|Two Bandwagons experiments on second page]], [[Strategy for Information Markets/Demand Structure with Network Effects|Demand Structure on second page]], [[Strategy for Information Markets/Two-Sided Platform|Two-sided platforms on second page]]

[[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Network_Effects|Network Effects section on main page]]
# &quot;''In any organization which focuses on information distribution...''&quot; This paragraph seems to be talking about network in two different senses.
## The first sense (&quot;''capable of processing, exchanging, and distributing the information''&quot;) appears to be talking about the network '''internal''' to the business, as important for logistics. That certainly can be important, but it's quite different than what we mean when we talk about network effects. I recommend dropping it. (If it's really something you're interested in, and would like to develop, then it's possible it could be developed in a different section.)
## The second sense (&quot;''will provide better performance in comparison to a competing network''&quot;) matches more closely what we normally mean talking about network effects. From here on the paragraph is a very condensed version of insights from ''Information Rules''. Those insights are good ones, and should be in the material on network effects somehow. I don't think this is the right format. It possibly should just be expanded as a sub-section, or possibly the different points should be distributed to elsewhere in the material, where they make the most sense. I'd probably take this paragraph, expand it a bit, and put it near the end of the network effects material as an &quot;applied strategy&quot; bit.
## The paragraph is about strategy for network goods, but not really about network structure.
# &quot;''When considering an abstract network structure...''&quot; This second paragraph starts to get at network structure, but doesn't really get there. You could go two ways with this, I think. You could expand the paragraph just a little, trying to make it clearer, but not get into details. Then it's a fine brief note on how you might want to think about network structure. Or you could try to develop it in more detail, in which case it does need a lot more detail. What kinds of network structure are common? What are some examples? How much control does a business have over the network structure-do they have to take it as a given? How do they respond strategically to a highly-connected or sparesley-connected or whatever network?

[[Strategy for Information Markets/Positive &amp; Negative Feedback|Positive &amp; Negative Feedback]]
# I thought the images were working? What happened?
# '''Digital Music Players''' I find this section interesting, but unconvincing. For instance, although the iPod and iTunes came to be the icons of digital music, the MP3 format has (I believe?) always dominated Apple's proprietary format (and the iPod has always played MP3's). So, where's the positive feedback? Is it just in the overall expansion of the digital music &quot;market&quot; (whether market includes pirated music or not), or is it in competition between different players and formats?
# '''Negative Feedback And High Definition Television''' This sounds like positive feedback?
# My suggestion for developing this section would be to clean up the general material on positive feedback a bit-it's pretty good as is. Mostly you don't need to worry about negative feedback. Describing negative feedback for this purpose is only a way to help make positive feedback more clear. Then work on discussing HD-DVD vs. Blu-Ray more.
## Were there points at which it looked like HD-DVD might win?
## How did the different standards approach the competition? How much were they open vs. closed, what alliances were formed, were products subsidized, etc?

[[Strategy for Information Markets/Demand Structure with Network Effects|Demand Structure]]
# &quot;''However I want to focus it on more specifically saturation, once the network got so large, outings could occur because of the overload''&quot; There's still some confusin here between saturation and negative network effects. '''Saturation''' can occur with or without network effects. If I'm selling ice cream, and I offer tasty flavors at great prices, I'll rapidly grow my market share, but I still won't ever sell to ''everyone'' in the neighborhood because some people will be on diets, or won't like ice cream, or whatever. That's saturation, it's when you've expanded to sell to everyone who's reasonably interested in what you're offering (of course the saturation point will change some with changes in price...). '''Negative network externalities''' is ''overload'' or ''congestion''-if there's a new road built and it fills up with traffic so that eventually people find it's better to take the longer route to avoid the traffic jams, that's a negative network externalitiy. If the telephone network can no longer handle the number of people making calls, that's a negative network externality. If the telephone network could handle a lot more calls, but more people aren't calling because they don't like talking on the phone, that's saturation.
# Either or both of these ideas-saturation and/or negative network effects-could be useful additions, although they aren't primary ares of concern for the course. I would break them out into separate sections if you want to develop them more. Discussing BitTorrent, for instance, as a technology for avoiding congestion, would be interesting broken out into a separate section.
# Generally, this section is good. You should implement the notes you've included about where you'd like to develop, if you can. The references to the images are a bit awkward currently. Off-setting that material into its own section on the page might make it cleaner. You do this a little already, but discussing expectations management in the same terms used for the graphs (critical mass) can make the technical sections on the strategy sections helpful to each other.

[[Strategy for Information Markets/Two-Sided Platform|Two-sided platforms]]
# '''Media Resources''' still tricky. For instance, the media resource (say, a television network) benefits from more advertisers, but that's not an externalitiy, it's a standard economic exchange between the two parties. There are probably clean examples-say a cable company provides a platform for TV stations to reach viewers. That's pretty clear-cut as a platform, but the clear-cutness also makes it les interesting.
# software/browsers - these need to be clarified. What is the platform (for software, will often be OS), what are the sides (the software developers, web site publishers, software users, web site readers).
# ''' Other''' - this is pretty good. It might be a good place to show a difference between one-sided network and two-sided platform, and how something can provide both. A mall benefits the one-sided network (a place for social gathering where more people is mostly better) and the two-sided platform (benefits consumers and stores, as you say).
# Pricing &amp; subsidies - combine your doubled-up text. Pictures would be really good here.

=== TDang 2nd review-Group D ===
Material: Some e-commerce on the main page: [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Online_business_methods|Online business methods on main page]] and 
[[Strategy for Information Markets/Online Stock Trading Sites|Online stock trading sites on second page]]

[[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Online_business_methods|Online business methods]]: The new material is a large leap in the right direction. I think that the existing material is enough to be the core of the section. What remains is to expand on and clarify what's there, and to integrate overlapping ideas. Here's some specific thoughts on that:
# My [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#TDang_Review-Group_D|previous comments]] still apply to the pre-existing material. It's not entirely clear what's original, and what's quotes or paraphrasing. The impression given is that it's almost entirely quotes and paraphrasing, in which case it shouldn't stay in the book. Take the valuable ideas from this material and integrate them in your own words (but referenced) into the newer material.
# '''E-Commerce Streams''' - This remains tricky for me. I imagine to someone in another field, the &quot;stream&quot; idea might be intuitive, but to me as an economist, it isn't, and I don't think we can assume it's intuitive to the readers of the wikibook. A little more clarification of the ideas is probably enough. Just as an example of my confusion, when I think &quot;stream&quot; I think of something flowing from A to B to C, etc. This doesn't seem to match (particularly) the &quot;revenue stream&quot; which I might instead call a &quot;revenue source&quot; or maybe even &quot;business model&quot; (advertising versus subscription, for instance, although these would really only be a part of a business model, they'd be a large part). For the particular streams given, the difference between the &quot;value stream&quot; and the &quot;logistical stream&quot; aren't clear. For instance, is shipping part of the value stream (it winds up bringing value to the customer) or part of the logistical stream (it moves stuff around)? Another point I'm confused about-does a business concern themselves with the &quot;stream&quot; beyond their own control? For instance, if I retail kitchen supplies, do I concern myself with the part of the &quot;stream&quot; which provides energy to silverware manufacturers?
# Supply vs. Demand / Cost vs. Revenue - This is the traditional way an economist divides up their thinking, and staying close to that model would be good if it doesn't mutilate the points you're trying to make. For instance, the &quot;logistical stream&quot; is clearly a cost/supply concern, and &quot;revenue stream&quot; is pretty clearly a demand/revenue concern. &quot;Value stream&quot; I don't understand well enough to say, or it's possible it doesn't fall neatly into the Supply/Demand model.
# Disintermediation - (see [[w:disintermediation|Wikipedia entry]]) This has been a major part of the discussion for e-Commerce, so this would be a great area for expansion.
# Strategic relationships / strategic resources - This isn't really clear. I'm not sure whether the connection of this to other material should be made more clear, or it stands alone and needs expansion, or it's only a partial thought and should be removed.
# &quot;''Using the Internet to take advantage of increased economies of scale can help companies determine more cost effective make vs. buy decisions.''&quot; - There's a lot in that sentence, and it deserves more attention. How does the internet allow a firm to take advantage of economies of scale? How does that relate to make vs. buy decisions?
# '''Value Creation''' - I'd prefer not to use the term &quot;value&quot; here, as I understand it. Essentially, you're describing profitability. When we talk about &quot;value&quot;, we want that to be concentrated on the final consumer-how much do they value what they're consuming? Again, using the Supply vs. Demand / Revenue vs. Cost approach can be useful here - complementarities can matter on either supply or demand side, but you're describing the demand side. Your efficiency is cost/supply side. Customer retention doesn't fall easily into the supply/demand framework, although it might be worthwhile to connect it to lock-in. (Also, please provide a more complete reference for the Christensen and Methlie bit-I don't understand how a business which increases revenue and decreases cost can avoid increasing profit.)
# EBay - This is a start, but it needs a lot more. There is little here that hasn't come up in general discussion during class. You need to get more in depth somehow. Some suggestions:
:* Read what others have written about EBay and find the major points to include here.
:* Examine why EBay has been so much more successful than competitors (like Yahoo auctions)
:* Consider the specific design (and redesign) of EBay's rules-why are the auctions designed the way they are, what changes have been made, how does the reputation system work?
:* How does EBay fit into the larger internet economy? When might a company decide to use EBay for online sales instead of (or in addition to) having their own web site? Is EBay more suitable for selling some kinds of things than others? How does it relate to disintermediation?

[[Strategy for Information Markets/Online Stock Trading Sites|Online stock trading]]: This is good material. I think it needs a bit more formally-referenced content, and you need to be careful how you discuss differentiation, but it shouldn't need a great deal more to be complete.

# Referenced content: You probably don't need a great deal of this, but it would help to reference some more of your large statements to show that you're describing something known rather than your impressions. Unfortunately, your one reference is to a blog, which isn't generally considered a very good source.
# '''Differentiation''' You need to be both more careful and more detailed in how you handle differentiation. &quot;Differentiation: is sometimes used in business literature almost as if it means &quot;being better&quot;, but that's not what it means in economics. Differentiation is about changing your offering in such a way that you don't have direct competition-by doing so you have given yourself market power, but in a smaller market. Making your product simply better is competing in quality and making it cheaper is competing in price. (A quality change can sometimes amount to differentiation if you simultaneously raise the price so that some consumers will choose not to buy from you, but making the market smaller is an essential part of differentiation.)
:* &quot;''Over the last 10 years, online brokerage houses have increased the services provided and driven down costs in order to yield differentiation.''&quot; Differentiation is a demand-side concern, while costs need to be considered (it may be that differentiation is possible, but the cost of doing so is too high to profitably sell it to the customers) driving down costs isn't primarily an element of differentiation.
:* &quot;''For example, many potential users will look to see who has the lowest price per trade. Looking at the bigger picture, what consumers want is a cheaper deal.''&quot; If business (say cell-phone plans) have complicated pricing schemes, then the details of those rules can be part of differentiation, because just as different consumers may choose different elements from a menu of two-part tariffs, different consumers might prefer different sellers who offer different price rules. However, if it's basically, &quot;buy from the company which is cheapest&quot;, that's simple price competition, not differentiation.
:* Concrete examples of differentiation would help. Are there different features which different firms offer, '''and''' that appeal to different users?
:* Alternatively, perhaps the online trading business is simply a commodity business, and there's not much room for successful differentiation? Do these companies make much profit? Can any of them afford to raise their prices?

Material: [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Dynamic_Competition|Dynamic competition]] This is an excellent section. For completion, you could go either of two routes: polish, or extend. Polishing would mean going through to carefully optimize the writing (particularly see the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Style_guide|style guide]] on emphasizing keywords), extending would mean things like working on your &quot;''Soon to be...''&quot; note.

There are a couple things I see which could use revision:

# &quot;''First movers can expect to recoup sunk costs.''&quot; -- I know what you mean (that they can expect to earn enough in the market to recover more than they spent in fixed costs), but I think the way you've phrased it could be misleading. The firm can't directly recover their sunk costs. Recall one of the things that a firm can do sometimes to ensure they have the first-mover advantage is to put themselves in a situation where they've got large sunk costs, so that a future entrant couldn't convince them to exit the market. This just needs some careful re-phrasing.

# Low economic Durability -- This is a lot clearer than what you had before, but I would still get rid of the &quot;durability&quot; expression and concentrate on the difficulty reselling.

# I'm a little torn on your example of the AT&amp;T/Apple contract. On the one hand, it's interesting, but it's at a different scale then we normally think about lock-in. Mostly we're talking about lock-in at the consumer level rather than a firm-to-firm alliance lock-in. I'd suggest changing it, but how you change it could go a few ways. You could completely replace it with a consumer-oriented example. Or you could offset it with a bit of explanation of how lock-in can be important even at the firm-to-firm level. If you wanted to take this second approach, I'd recommend searching for some information on [http://www.google.com/search?q=hold-up+problem&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a the hold-up problem] (you can ask me for help finding references if you want).

Material: [[Strategy for Information Markets/Network Neutrality|Net Neutrality on second page]], [[Strategy for Information Markets/Intellectual Property|Intellectual Property on second page]], [[Strategy for Information Markets/Collaborative Filtering|Collaborative Filtering on second page]], [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Censorship_in_Southeast_Asia|Censorship in SE Asia]]

[[Strategy for Information Markets/Network Neutrality|Net Neutrality]] I think this needs a lot of polish, but maybe not a great deal more development. Here's stuff on polish:
# &quot;''An example of this being earlier this year, AT&amp;T...''&quot; This bit, through the end of the paragraph is '''really''' confusing. Try rephrasing carefully.
# Style: decide whether &quot;network neutrality&quot; deserves to be uppercase or not. A likely way to deal with it is in the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Style_guide|style guide]] on &quot;emphasizing keywords&quot;
# Timeliness - Because this is an issue of current politics, the status could be completely different 6 months or 2 years from now. The material is therefore potentially dated in any case, but that's OK. Try to deal with it by phrasing things so they won't actually be '''wrong''' in a year. For instance, &quot;As of late 2009, the U.S. Congress is considering...&quot;
# International - Some description of how this is playing out internationally would be helpful. What happens if the U.S. implements particular rules on net neutrality, but the EU acts differently? Is this even under discussion in other parts of the world?
# References - try to provide references for material. It would be good to have this for analysis. It's '''necessary''' for any description of any group's policy arguments.
# Just a bit more development on the issues of who gains and loses from net neutrality would be good.
# Thinking more about anti-trust, this might be good, but unless you're working from good sources who have written exactly about that, I think it might get too speculative. If you're determined to address anti-trust, that should probably go into a more general section of the book on policy.

[[Strategy for Information Markets/Intellectual Property|Intellectual Property on second page]]
# &quot;''A good breakdown of this problem can be seen in the origins of copyright law in the late 18th century in Germany.''&quot; OK, this got me all interested, and then nothing! It needs follow-through, or to be removed.
# &quot;''Extending these property rights into...''&quot; The final paragraph is extremely dense-there's a whole lot going on there, and it's not fully developed. Essentially, it's a chapter unto itself. I think it could be extended into 2-3 paragraphs and dealt with a little more carefully.
# Given the state of what you have written, I again would say that trademarks are a distraction. I would deal with them with a footnote or a single sentence in parentheses, rather than a paragraph.
# I'd recommend that in the first or second paragraph, you make a clear statement about the intent of copyright &amp; patent laws. It's a little fuzzy now, and broken up into different places. (Also, the intent is not necessarily to allow '''maximum''' profit, but enough profit to encourage IP production in the first place.)
# ''If you wanted to'', as a policy argument, this motivation for the laws could be contrasted with [[w:rent seeking|rent seeking]].

[[Strategy for Information Markets/Collaborative Filtering|Collaborative Filtering on second page]] Obviously, you have the intent to develop more here, but what you have currently is excellent. You've used references and specific examples well. So, mostly I'd say continue this style through some of the other material you intend to add. A few specific suggestions:
# &quot;first-mover bias&quot; -- you could connect this to [[w:information cascades|information cascades]], as we explored briefly with the [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Two_Bandwagons#Herding_game|classroom experiment]].
# Astroturfing is a potentially major opportunity or problem for businesses, depending on whether they want to exploit collaborative filtering, or rely on accurate filtering. It's always been a major concern for Google, for example, in trying to prevent people from gaming the search engine rules to get their own sites ranked highly. Describing how firms combat astroturfing deserves at least a paragraph, and it could warrant a good deal more development, depending on how you want to balance the section.

[[Strategy_for_Information_Markets#Censorship_in_Southeast_Asia|Censorship in SE Asia]] No development since last review?

== Areas not covered ==

Here are some ares which seem likely to be worth covering in some version of the wikibook, but aren't going to be in this iteration:
=== &quot;Open&quot; Business Strategies ===
This overlaps several areas, including standards and intellectual property. The clearest way to profit on information goods is with control. However, there are those who profit while relinquishing control. Cover those business strategies.
=== User Information ===
==== Privacy ====
=== Software as Service ===
*[[w:Software as a service|Wikipedia article]]
=== Online Games ===
This might be tangential to a general-purpose strategy book, but [[w:Virtual economics|Virtual economics]] is an interest of mine, and games in one form or another, are significant parts of the internet.
=== Extension of Information Markets ===
Some markets for non-information goods still have a large amount of their value come from information and intellectual property: [[w:pharmaceuticals|pharmaceuticals]], for instance. New technologies, such as advances in [[w:computer-aided manufacturing|computer-aided manufacturing]] could turn markets for non-information goods into information goods.
=== Transaction Costs ===
''This material is covered somewhat in the material currently in the book-copied this here in case it's worth developing into its own section later.''

What impact does e-commerce have on [[w:transaction costs|transaction costs]]? Certainly there is less transaction cost in distributing material over the internet versus physical products at stores. Are there extra transaction costs for information goods which aren't present for physical goods?

== Final review ==
I am asking for something different on this review. Rather than reviewing another group's material to help them, I'd like you to discuss your own group's material. Assume that your group is done developing the Wikibook, but someone else will pick it up to further develop it in the future. How would you advise them to build on what you've done?
:Another way to think about this: imagine that you're done with this project for now, but you'll have to come back to it in two years after you've forgotten what you were doing. What advice would you give ''yourself'' to help you get back into the swing of developing the material?

=== Final review-Group A ===
Review Personal: I believe that this section does have a solid base.  What I mean by that is that the chapter flows together and there is a sense of purpose reading it.  The down fall of this section is that the topics are too minimal.  The subjects are just bits and pieces of topics but there is no foundation topic to the chapter.  Moving forward we might like to add lock-in in this chapter, and set it as the principle theme.  This way we can tell the reader of a proven system to maintain customers.  Understanding how to establish a lock-in and then principle payment methods would help complete the chapter.  I believe that we could remove the section on auctions, bring this principle in might be difficult to tie together. --[[User:Econ17|Econ17]] ([[User talk:Econ17|talk]]) 06:18, 5 December 2009 (UTC)

=== Final review-Group B ===
The information covered in this chapter taps into such a small aspect of the field it discusses. It does a good job introducing
topics  but it would require a lot more in depth work to really uncover all the ways we benefit from collecting information.
I hope someone can uncover all the different ways to turn data into information, and than how to utilize this information
as a way to gain an advantage in some type of industry. There are many different statistics and makes it very useful to have
a guideline on how to make the correct decisions from the information and not misunderstand findings in the data to
come to a wrong conclusion. Some occurences have effects on other statistics regardless of orgiional predictions, it is hard
to calculate the change in data that will occur, all these different angles on the topic barely broached in this chapter would be
beneficial in so many ways.

=== Final review-Group C ===
For our group, network effects, I think that overall our group did a very good job developing the ideas surrounding network effects. I think the intro network effects on the main page did a good job at setting up a good basis and explanation of what would be talked about in our section and chapters. 

One of the things that I feel our group could have done a little bit better would have been setting up the topic a little bit more. We began our portion of the project without giving a lot of background on the topics. I think this is because we expected our classmates to understand what we were talking about. I’m sure they did, however, someone looking at the project that does not have background knowledge of the subject may feel a little bit insecure with what it being talked about. I think only can be fixed by working together as a total class linking each groups sections together and not the sections within a group. This would help with a cohesive flow throughout the whole book and not just the sections. 

As for our group I think we did a fairly good job on linking all of the different portions of the project together. We had good transitions and flow between the topics and did a very good job a mentioning the various topics throughout each of the sections in out groups. We also highlighted the main concept of network in EVERY one of the different sections in our group. I think this is one of points that makes our project very good. 

I think another very positive aspect of our sections was the information and material we provided was not presented in a too complex way. Even in some of the more technical sections of the project. To make the concepts more understandable we used several different graphs that were well presented and explained. No other groups directly used graphs, so I think that our group’s graphs were a very helpful contribution to not only our section, but the overall project. --[[User:KingKing|KingKing]] ([[User talk:KingKing|talk]]) 03:37, 8 December 2009 (UTC)

=== Final review-Group D ===

Final Review (self evaluation): The overall finished product of our section appears to have a good amount of detail and a strong message. However, there is definitely room for additional material in the future. For example, the online stock trading sites second page covers the several topics pretty well, but it would be a stronger page if a few more concepts were included, such as the cost structure for these trading sites, and maybe a section about economies of scale in that particular market. If someone were to pick up this section in the future, I would say that those 2 topics would be most important to add. Another possible change for the section as a whole would be to polish the layout of the chapter.  I feel as though the smaller sections seem a bit scattered and the order could be fixed a bit. Another section that should be expanded in the future is eBay, which could benefit with more on competition, cost structure, and possibly how this site is able to differentiate from other online auction sites. For someone attacking this project in the future, I would suggest to create a second page for the eBay section and add those specific topics. For the online business methods and value creation sections, I think that both are well written and detailed. A suggestion for expansion of the value creation section would be to go more in depth on the different costs mentioned in the beginning.  The final product of the online business methods section is clear and easily understandable with the 3 different models being broken up into each their own paragraph. The next step for this area would be expansion and examples. 

E-commerce streams portion has a good amount of information, and not much would need to be added to this section. The same goes for the future of e-commerce, which appears to already have a great deal of the topic covered. The main focus of additions to this section in the future is basic expansion of what is already written, and perhaps adding the suggested topics mentioned above. There seems to be enough information present for a newcomer to read and review our section, and get a good idea of what is being covered. Overall, the final product seems to be heading in the right direction. The information is there, but expansion and polishing both details and the format of the chapter should be key in future revisions. I think that each different topic could definitely use more examples to make everything more understandable. Cleaning up the chapter by formatting in a different order and adding an introduction is another task that I wish I would have done in the past. Hopefully these suggestions and additions can be made in the future in order to give this book a more expanded version of our chapter.

The evolution of the online business section has been interesting indeed. It has had its roots firmly grounded in the B. Mahadevan article since the beginning, but the latest version has made a welcome transition from being the article, to using the articles information as a guideline for expanding on online business models. There is room for more examples of businesses that fall into the three general categories. Also, it could be interesting to see the assumptions of online business, essentially the entirety of e-commerce, clarified in laymen’s terms to make the book more friendly for novice internet users.   

The value creation section does a good job showing the differences and advantages of doing business online compared to traditional brick and mortar business. Many of the key ideas are well explained; however, some use further explanation and analysis to justify their role in value creation. Also, similar to online business models, this section could clarify some of the assumptions that are made in order to show a clearer thought path. 

The future of e-commerce is interesting in that it talks about acknowledging the importance of social constructs in e-commerce. This section takes one perspective on a particular future evolution, namely online shopping, but could do well by providing analysis for other areas of future development in other sections of e-commerce. The future is very hard to predict and technology is changing rapidly. The status quo today has the potential to be obsolete in six months. Although this highly unlikely, it is a possibility.

E-commerce streams does an excellent job of providing a lot of good information and walking the reader through the processes and applications. The section discussing disintermediation is particularly relevant for the chapter as a whole and I think it was very appropriate to dedicate space for explaining the idea. This section excels at clarifying assumptions that could easily be left to be inferred. I think it could possibly benefit from including more examples on e-commerce value and revenue streams and how they function.

The Ebay section is entertaining in that it provides a good account of the company’s history. It could benefit from focusing more on how it has revolutionized online marketplaces. It would be interesting to have a competitive analysis throughout the existence of Ebay to show how it became a market leader and dictated the evolution of its own competition.

Online stock trading sites is a clear, well laid out account of the world of online stock trading. Beginning with the history and moving to the differentiation was a good transition. The differentiation and competitive analysis was the most complete of the section. I particularly enjoyed the ice cream shop analogy. I think it could be applied to many forms of online business, including online stock trading. From an economics perspective it was nice to read the section on the reasons for industry popularity and consumer demand. Clearly none of the e-commerce businesses would be possible without a visible and clear demand structure. This section is a breath of fresh air based on that perspective.

Overall, the various sections are quite a hodgepodge of e-commerce facets. In the future it would be nice to see a more streamlined and organized product, similar to what a few of the authors mentioned in their works. I believe this is a humble beginning for a complicated and evolving topic. --[[User:Tthomas2|Tthomas2]] ([[User talk:Tthomas2|talk]]) 00:51, 7 December 2009 (UTC)

Despite some redundant material, the information provided by Group D in the section of “e-commerce” appears very sound and informative. In addition to the material provided in each branch of e-commerce, the group did a good job providing structure to the section and made sure the topics flowed easily from one to the other. 

Online business methods was a great starting point for the group as it set the basis for what was to be discussed later on. While much of the information was received from the B Mahadevan article, the member who contributed to that section made sure all material provided was necessary and understandable. By breaking the business methods down into three distinct categories (portals, market makers, business transactions), the reader is eased into the details of e-commerce and how an online business functions successfully. The details showing the relationship between the three categories along with their differences also helps to clear the air of any questions the reader may have.

Value creation is also a well put together section. Continuing off of business models, value creation does a good job of showing the work that is put into a company’s success. Furthermore, the topic also places more emphasis on the internet based value creation and how vital it is for e-commerce. By showing how companies utilize the internet for value creation, the reader is given a good idea of the potential of internet use as a business mechanism. One place for improvement could have been to dive further into the cost structures and foundation of value creation, but overall the topic is solid.

While I would have preferred to have “The Future of E-Commerce” section placed at the end of the group’s subject, the information provided draws a clear picture of what to expect from companies in terms of evolution through the internet. In addition to showing the potential of e-commerce, the group member who contributed to the section does a good job of laying out the work that needs to be done in order to achieve the goals of progress in e-commerce. The best example of this is the study done by Professor Schummer in terms of online shopping. While I would have liked to have seen other industries explored in this section, I feel “The Future of E-Commerce” was put together very well.

Like “The Future of E-Commerce”, “E-Commerce Streams” is a section I would have liked to have seen expanded. The contributor does a good job of laying out the three main value streams as well as provides examples that are clear to the reader. However, I feel that more time and more examples could have been used for the paragraph on disintermediation. This seems to be a very important aspect of value stream mapping and also ties directly to a company’s success. Although attempted, the contributor also could have gone into further explanation regarding the logistical stream and how it differs from the value stream to be a topic of its own. On a positive note, the contributor does a good job of not only providing examples for the material discussed, but provides clear descriptions of just how the processes work. 

While I don’t feel the eBay section was truly necessary for the subject of e-commerce, the example is beneficial in the sense that it provides a real life example of how a business can succeed in the internet world. It uses the company a means to tie into other aspects of e-commerce (C2C Network, online community, etc) which provides a good summary for the wiki book in general. That said, I feel more attention could have been focused on the cost structure and how the website generates revenue.
Online stock trading sites might be the most clear and well put together section in the e-commerce subject. The segmentation between “background”, “differentiation”, and “popularity” provides a terrific road map through the topic and gives the reader clear examples of what online trading has become. In my opinion, the online stock trading section is what the eBay section should have become (under the title “Online Auction Sites”). It provides a brief history, how sites differ from one another as well as the features that make it so popular. Additionally, the contributor does a good job explaining how online trading has affected traditional trading in the present day. 

Overall, I feel the contributions made by Group D were both very informative and very understandable. While there can be some expansion on some categories/topics, the group succeeded in the aspect that it provides complex information in a nature that can be picked up and easily read by someone who wants to learn about E-Commerce. --[[User:AAnderson7|AAnderson7]] ([[User talk:AAnderson7|talk]]) 00:53, 7 December 2009 (UTC)

Online business has been becoming big part of 21st century's economics. 

By finishing this project, I learned about e-commerce more and more. We talked about briefly online business methods such as online trading sites, ebay, value creation, and future of e-commerce. We did a good job introducing topics and illustrated about how it works. Our whole structure is clear and have a decent amount of details. 
Our group contributed their part at their best. At the end it came out with path to each section to each section smoothly. 

Overall. each sections provide variety and diversity about e-commerce which could be a ultimate description for people who does not study internet economics.--[[User:Thesung41|Thesung41]] ([[User talk:Thesung41|talk]]) 14:39, 8 December 2009 (UTC)

=== Final review-Group E ===
'''Final Review and Suggestions for future editors.'''

Overall, I am reasonably happy with my final product here, and the work that I put into my section. I to pedantically follow the advice of my reviewers, and I think that their guidance helped to guide me away from erroneous or misleading explanation. Also very influential was a paper that I found online during the course of the semester. It was a graduate paper on job markets written by the professor. Although I did not glean information from the paper directly, it did allow me, tangentially, to become more comfortable with the concepts of Individual and Systemic Lock-in than I would have simply attending lectures. 

I think that the biggest limiting factor for me was that I worked alone, rather than in a group. Usually I prefer working alone, as I don't have to carry anyone else's load, nor answer to group members. However, I think that I underestimated the work that this project required. That is not to say that the final product is or was necessarily expected to be considerably voluminous. Rather, the understanding needed to write intelligently about the assigned topics(Dynamic Competition: Individual Lock-in, Systemic Lock-in, and First-Mover Advantage), while avoiding the pitfalls of false conclusions, was much more intimate than I had expected. It would have certainly been much easier if I had had two teammates with which to divide the work, each of us focus on mastering an individual section.

Another Limiting factor for me was my the trouble that I ran into trying to publish graphs supporting my explanations. This is somewhat a product of not allowing myself enough time, i.e. procrastination. However, I still cannot figure out how to convert an Excel or Google Docs graph into a .gif file so that I can upload to Wikibooks via the Uploader. I think that a decision tree and a decision matrix would both be very strong supplements to the First-Mover advantage sections. I hope that any future editors will have better luck with this. Additionally, future editors will have a better opportunity to include internal links and documentary references to other sections of the wikibook. I think that in my section along with those of the the other groups, internal links and more cohesive formatting and referencing could really go a long way towards creating a more polished book.

=== Final review-Group R ===

Collaborative Filtering section was done very well. The transition of topics was clearly marked allowing the reader to  easily navigate an overview before delving into the specifics of each section. Each of the other topics (Intellectual Property and Network Neutrality) could definitely be revamped with distinct separators to differentiate topics. This would also aide in the clarity of each section by assigning a specific heading to be covered thoroughly in the proceeding paragraphs. Increasing the distance between paragraphs to show changes in topics or alternating the size or characteristics of the font would also serve as an eye-catching break of the monotony of continuous text.

Intellectual Property Rights is an essential topic for any future discussion on information traffic and business in an increasingly virtual era. There are a few good examples of types of property rights, though singling out a few as being easier to enforce or protect would be more beneficial. Given rates of piracy, what are a few alternative methods besides legal action that can be taken to protect Intellectual Property?

There is a lot of good information in each of the topics, though navigating them is a tad cumbersome. Including any reference material and links to other sources is a good idea so that a reader of the material can backtrack through and gain a better understanding of the specific situations. Censorship in East Asia is definitely a good topic because of the rising importance of trade, both physical and virtual, with a strengthening East Asia block. Having some insight into the methodology as well as the mentality behind the various censorship endeavors helps an would-be investor or business manager in assessing the overall cost of entering a market with limited freedoms and restricted protections on sensitive information stored or transmitted online.

Keeping spaces open for breaking developments on global arrangements of property rights, privacy laws and other issues keeps in mind that, with a rapidly changing legal fight, the final strategies are too jumbled to be of much use. An assessment of currently existing laws, both national and international, would be beneficial for a reader attempting to navigate through some of the finer details relating to specific areas and trading blocks. 

There is still a lot of necessary work to be done before this can be considered complete.  [[User:Spacedmonkeey|Spacedmonkeey]]([[User talk:Spacedmonkeey|talk]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">JULY 28, 2010 

I AM A WOMAN WHO HAS RECENTLY RECOMMITTED MY LIFE TO GOD. ON SUNDAY JULY 25, 2010 GOD CALLED ME OUT OF A LIFE OF SIN AND SHAME. I HAD A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRIST AS A 10YEAR OLD AND DO REMEMBER GOD CLEARLY AS EARLY AS THE AGE OF 5 YRS OLD. I REMEMBER THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO KINDERGARTEN BEING SO ATTACHED TO MY MOTHER, AND I REMEMBER PRAYING TO GOD TO LET ME BE ABLE TO STAY HOME JUST A WHILE LONGER, NOW, TO ME IT WAS A MIRACLE, BUT IN ACTUALITY MY BIRTHDAY FELL IN OCTOBER AND I LEGALLY HAD TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR. NOW, TO ME THAT WAS A HUGE MIRACLE AND NO DOUBT MY FIRST. 
I JUST READ &quot;THE HEBREW ROOTS&quot;..THE ORIGINAL FOUNDATION OF REPENTANCE&quot; IT WAS SO TOUCHING TO SEE MYSELF IN PRINT. 
MY PASTOR, WHO IS MY GREAT NEPHEW, CALLED TO TELL ME THAT BIBLE STUDY WAS CANCELED DUE TO INCLEMENT WEATHER THAT MAY BE APPROACHING CHICAGO...
SO FAR NO RAIN...IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GOING TO RAIN FOR A MINUTE THERE, SKIES ARE CLOUDY BUT STILL NO RAIN. 
THE LORD LED ME &quot;BY HAND&quot; TO THIS WEBSITE, I HAD NEVER VISITED HERE BEFORE AND I JUST KNOW THAT GOD HAS HIS HAND ON MY LIFE AND HAS LED ME HERE.....TO THE POINT OF REPENTANCE'
THANK YOU JESUS FOR YOUR PRECIOUS HOLY SPIRIT ...YOU SAID &quot;HE WOULD LEAD AND GUIDE ME INTO ALL TRUTHS..AND THAT IS YOUR PROMISE TO ME. 
THANK YOU FOR KEEPING YOUR PROMISE TO ME LORD, I WILL, EACH DAY, LIVE MY LIFE AS A TESTIMONY TO YOUR GOODNESS, UNMERITED FAVOR AND MERCY TOWARD ME.</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">====== Multiple inheritance ======
Multiple inheritance is the process by which one class can inherit the properties of two or more classes (variously known as its base classes, or parent classes, or ancestor classes, or super-classes).

{{NOTE|In some similar language, multiple inheritance is restricted in various ways to keep the language simple, such as by allowing inheritance from only one real class and a number of &quot;interfaces&quot;, or by completely disallowing multiple inheritance.  C++ places the full power of multiple inheritance in the hands of programmers, but it is needed only rarely, and (as with most techniques) can complicate code if used inappropriately.  Because of C++'s approach to multiple inheritance, C++ has no need of separate language facilities for &quot;interfaces&quot;; C++'s classes can do everything that interfaces do in other related languages.}}

This is shown more in more detail in the [[C++ Programming/Classes/Inheritance|C++ Classes Inheritance Section]] of the book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Scientific Method}}

== Principles ==
The laws of nature as we understand them are the bases for all empirical sciences. They are the result of postulates (specific laws) that have passed experimental verification resulting in principles that are widely accepted and can be re-verified (using observation or experimentation).

== World View (Axioms, Postulates) ==
The word &quot;axiom&quot; comes from the Greek word αξιωμα (axioma), which means that which is deemed worthy or fit or that which is considered self-evident.

To &quot;postulate&quot; is to assume a theory valid due to be based on an a given set of axioms, resulting on the creation of a new axiom, this is so due to be self evident, &quot;axiom,&quot; &quot;postulate,&quot; and &quot;assumption&quot; are used interchangeably.  

Generally speaking, axioms are all the laws that are generally considered true but largely accepted on faith, they cannot be derived by principles of deduction nor demonstrable by formal proofs—simply because they are starting assumptions, other examples include personal beliefs, political views, and cultural values.  An axiom is the basic precondition underlying a theory.

Another thing one should be aware is that some fields of science predate the scientific method, for instance alchemy is now part of chemistry and physics and math was created even before we had numbers, one should have particular attention that in some fields the definitions or nomenclature may be out dated or be so for historical reasons, due to their use since before the definition of scientific method, and that mathematics uses not only the scientific method but also logical deductions, that result in theorems.  

Take for instance the use of the word &quot;axiom&quot; in mathematics, this particular field has gone by several changes, especially in the 19th century, but due to historic reasons an &quot;axiom&quot; in mathematics does have a particular meaning.

Euclid's geometry, is based on a system of axioms that look self-evident. So, in physics, Euclid's geometry was used as natural (and the only) choice, the complete theory could be drawn from the axioms, resulting in the whole geometry to be considered to be true and self evident.  This changed in the early 19th century, Gauss, Johann Bolyai, and Lobatchewsky, each independently, took a different approach. Beginning to suspect that it was impossible to prove the Parallel Postulate, they set out to develop a self-consistent geometry in which that postulate was false.  In this they were successful, thus creating the first non-Euclidean geometry.  By 1854, Bernhard Riemann, a student of Gauss, had applied methods of calculus in a ground-breaking study of the intrinsic (self-contained) geometry of all smooth surfaces, and thereby found a different non-Euclidean geometry.
 
It remained to be proved mathematically that the non-Euclidean geometry was just as self-consistent as Euclidean geometry, and this was first accomplished by Beltrami in 1868. With this, non-Euclidean geometry (both Lobatchewsky and Lobatchewsky) was established on an equal mathematical footing with Euclidean geometry.  But this raised issues, &quot;what geometry is true?&quot;. Even more, &quot;does the latest question make sense?&quot;. All three geometries are based on different system of axioms, all are consistent. 

Physics has helped answer these questions.  While Euclid's geometry is used on Newtons' mechanics (normal distance), Riemann's geometry became fundamental for Einstein's theory of relativity. Moreover, Lobatchewsky's geometry was used later in quantum mechanics. So, question &quot;Which one of these theories is correct for our physical space?&quot; was answered in the surprising way: &quot;All geometries represents physical space, but on a different scale&quot;. 

All this influences what to think about axioms. From end of 19th century - beginning 20th century, math didn't appeal to the &quot;self-evidence&quot; of the axioms. It takes the freedom to freely choice axioms. What does, math say, that ''if the axioms are true, then the theory is followed from the axioms''. Correspondence to the real world should be established separately. Axioms doesn't provide any guarantee.

;Example of conflict of mathematics/theoretical physics and the scientific method
The best example lies with ''[[w:quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]]''. Many facets of quantum mechanics are merely mathematical models explaining the behavior and interaction between [[w:Subatomic particle|subatomic particles]]. One of the major stumbling blocks in quantum mechanics lies within one its' fundamental theories: [[w:Quantum superposition|Quantum superposition]] (all particles exist in all states at the same time). There are many [[w:Interpretations of quantum mechanics#Summary of common interpretations of QM|interpretations]] of this, the standard being the [[w:Copenhagen interpretation|Copenhagen interpretation]]. This states, basically, that the act of measuring (or observing) the state of a particle collapses the superposition effect, altering it's state to the value defined by the measurement. This shows that the superposition effect, while being one of the most widely accepted and fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, can never actually be directly observed, even if it is possible for experiments to be devised to corroborate the theory.

== Theory ==
Consists in a set of statements or principles devised to provide an explanation to a group of facts or phenomena. For instance a mathematical theorem; in the mathematical field we have to be careful on how we apply the definition since a theorem may be considered an axiom in itself, they can be accepted as valid until proved false (due to the infinite nature of numbers, it is common to propose limits to sets to provide validation), and other mathematical  theorems may depend or be created over each others assumption of validity.

=== Hypothesis === 
The hypothesis, or the '''model''' is a way for us to make sense of the data. We try to fit the data into some kind of model, and that model is our hypothesis.

=== Predictions ===
A key component to the scientific method is the ability to predict. We can make predictions about something, and then test those predictions to see if they are correct. If the predictions are true, it's likely that the hypothesis is correct.

=== Theorems ===
Are not part of the scientific method but may be a cause of some confusion.  Most theorems have two components, called the hypotheses and the conclusions. The proof of the theorem is a logical argument demonstrating that the conclusions are a necessary consequence of the hypotheses, in the sense that if the hypotheses are true then the conclusions must also be true, without any further assumptions. The concept of a theorem is therefore fundamentally deductive, in contrast to the notion of a scientific theory, which is empirical.

== Verification ==
The fundamental step of turning an hypothetical relation into a principle, by validating it with real world data. Any verified  hypothesis becomes a principle.  

=== Observations ===
an act or instance of viewing or noting a fact or occurrence for some scientific or other special purpose.

=== Experiments ===
Experiments are key to the scientific method. Without experiments, any conclusions are just conjecture.  We need to test our observations (to ensure the observations are unbiased and reproducible), we need to test our hypothesis, and then we need to test the predictions we make with our hypothesis.

Setting up of a proper experiment is important, and we will discuss it at length in section 2.

Yuvarlak, yuvarlak köfte, or γιουβαρλάκια (youvarlakia), meaning round in Turkish, are a kind of large meatball in sauce. The meat mixture includes rice or bulgur. They are cooked in moist heat and the juices thickened with avgolemono. They are found in Turkish and Greek cuisine.

==Ingredients==

*1 kg (2.2 lbs) ground [[Cookbook:beef|beef]]
*2 cups [[Cookbook:rice|rice]] (short grained, suitable for soup)
*2 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*1 large [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], diced
*2 Tablespoons [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*4 Tablespoons [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:margarine|margarine]] (substitute: 6 tablespoons olive oil)
*juice from one [[Cookbook:lemon|lemon]]
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste
*some white all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]

==Procedure==

# Combine the ground beef with 1 egg, 1 cup of the rice, the salt and pepper.
# Mix thoroughly and form into meatballs the size of a ping-pong ball (4 cm).
# Cover each ball in a layer of white flour.
# In a large pot, sauté the diced onion in the butter/margarine or oil. Add 2 litres of water to the pot and bring to the boil.
# Drop each meatball in the boiling water.
# After 30 minutes, add the second cup of rice directly to the soup. Boil for 15 more minutes and get the pot off the heat.
# In a large bowl, beat one egg white (keep the yolk separate) and a little water into a foam (careful, grease or fat prevents foam from forming, and you end up with an unappetizing runny egg-white). To stabilize the foam add the juice of one lemon. Continue to whisk as you add the egg yolk. This is called &quot;avgolemono&quot; (egg and lemon) and is used to thicken soups (instead of heavy cream).
# Slowly pour one cup of the hot soup into the avgolemono while continuously whisking (so that the egg has a chance to warm up to the soup temperature, preventing it from becoming an omelette) and then pour the mixture into the pot, mixing it with the soup.

Serve hot.

== Problem 1 ==
Tony and Aaron's aunt came to visit. She gave each of the boys 25 marbles.  Tony won 12 marbles from Aaron during the visit. How many marbles did Tony have after they played?

== Problem 2 ==
Tony and Aaron go to the park.  They can see 17 turtles sunning themselves on an island in the middle of a pond around the lake.  As Tony and Aaron circle the lake to count the turtles they hear 24 plops as they scare more turtles from the shore.  How many turtles do Tony and Aaron know live in the lake?

== Problem 3 ==
Tony's teacher is grading the math tests for his class.  He has graded 16 math tests, and has 11 more to grade.  How many students are there in Tony's math class?

== Problem 4 ==
Tony and Aaron live 3 miles from the park.  Today their mom said she will drive 2 miles away from the park to pick up their friend Luke.  How many miles does Tony and Aaron's mom have to drive to take the boys to the park?`

== Problem 5 ==
In addition to these word problems which use integers, you will need to recall principles of adding decimals, fractions, and negative numbers. See if you can answer these questions; if not, you may wish to [[Arithmetic/Addition and Subtraction|review how to perform these addition operations]]:

*&lt;math&gt;\ 0.1 + 0.1&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\ 1.7 + 3&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\ 3.95 + 0.2&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\ 15.05 + 0.52&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{2}{3} + \frac{5}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\ 5 + -2&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\ 7 + -9&lt;/math&gt;

== Problem 1 ==
''Tony and Aaron's aunt came to visit. She gave each of the boys 25 marbles.  Tony won 12 marbles from Aaron during the visit. How many marbles did Tony have after they played?''

Tony started with 25 marbles.
Tony won 12 marbles from Aaron.

&lt;math&gt;\ 25 + 12 = 37&lt;/math&gt; marbles

== Problem 2 ==
''Tony and Aaron go to the park.  They can see 17 turtles sunning themselves on an island in the middle of a pond around the lake.  As Tony and Aaron circle the lake to count the turtles they hear 24 plops as they scare more turtles from the shore.  How many turtles do Tony and Aaron know live in the lake?''

17 turtles on the island.
24 plops as turtles jump in the pond.

&lt;math&gt;\ 17 + 24 = 41&lt;/math&gt; turtles

== Problem 3 ==
''Tony's teacher is grading the math tests for his class.  He has graded 16 math tests, and has 11 more to grade.  How many students are there in Tony's math class?''

16 math tests graded
11 math tests to grade

&lt;math&gt;\ 16 + 11 = 27&lt;/math&gt; tests

== Problem 4 ==
''Tony and Aaron live 3 miles from the park.  Today, their mom said she will first drive 2 miles away from the park to pick up their friend Luke before driving to the park.  How many miles does Tony and Aaron's mom have to drive to take the boys to the park?''

Mom has to drive 2 miles to Luke's house.
Tony and Aaron's House is 3 miles from the park.

This means that Luke's house is &lt;math&gt;\ 2 + 3 = 5&lt;/math&gt; miles from the park.

Mom had to drive an extra 2 miles to pick up Luke. So Mom had to drive &lt;math&gt;\ 2 + 5 = 7&lt;/math&gt; miles to take the three children to the park.

== Problem 5 ==
The [[Arithmetic/Addition and Subtraction|Arithmetic textbook]] should give you a review of how to add the following if you are confused or need a refresher:

*&lt;math&gt;\ 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\ 1.7 + 3 = 4.7&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\ 3.95 + 0.2 = 4.15&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\ 15.05 + 0.52 = 15.57&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{2}{3} + \frac{5}{3} = \frac{7}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\ 5 + -2 = 3&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\ 7 + -9 = -2&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Charles Walcott.jpg|200px|thumb|left|'''Figure 12.15''': Charles Doolittle Walcott.]]
In the summer of 1909, an American scientist named Charles Doolittle Walcott (Figure 12.15) was in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. He was a paleontologist, which is a scientist who studies past life on Earth. He was searching for fossils. Riding on horseback, he was making his way down a mountain trail when he noticed something on the ground. He stopped to pick it up. It was a fossil! He began to dig around the area and found even more fossils. The fossils that Walcott found were of some of the most bizarre organisms anyone had ever seen. One of the organisms preserved in the fossils had a soft body like a worm, five eyes, and a long nose like a vacuum cleaner hose (Figure 12.16). Most of the fossils were the remains of animals that do not live today. They are now extinct, which means that nothing of their kind lives and that they are gone forever.
{{clear}}
[[File:Opabinia BW.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 12.16''': This bizarre animal with five eyes lived during the Cambrian. Fossils of it were discovered by Charles Walcott.]]

The organisms in Walcott's fossils lived during a time of geologic history known as the Cambrian. The Cambrian period began about 540 million years ago. It marked the beginning of the Phanerozoic Eon. It also marked the beginning of many new and complex life forms appearing on Earth. In fact, the term Phanerozoic means &quot;time of well-displayed life&quot;. We still live today in the Phanerozoic Eon. However, life on Earth is very different today than it was 540 million years ago. This lesson covers some of the history of life on Earth. It will show you how living things have developed and changed over the last 540 million years of the Phanerozoic Eon. You will learn about how species adapt and evolve over time.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Describe how adaptations develop.
* Explain how the fossil record shows us that species evolve over time.
* Describe the general development of Earth's life forms over the last 540 million years.

==Evaluating Prior Knowledge==
Be sure that you can answer the following questions before you begin this lesson.

* What is a fossil?
* How is geologic time divided?
* How do organisms depend on their environment to live?

==Earth's Diversity==
[[File:Animalia diversity.jpg|250px|thumb|'''Figure 12.17''': There is an amazing diversity of organisms on Earth.]]

There are over 1 million species of plants and animals known to be currently alive on Earth (Figure 12.17). Scientists believe there are millions more that have not been discovered yet. Look around you and you notice that the organisms on this planet have incredible '''variation'''. One of the most remarkable features of Earth's organisms is their ability to survive in their specific environments. For example, polar bears have thick fur coats that help them stay warm in the icy waters that they hunt in (Figure 12.18). Reindeer have sponge-like hoofs that help them walk on snowy ground without slipping and falling. Plants that live in dry desert environments have special stems and leaves that help them conserve water.

[[File:Ursus maritimus 4 1996-08-04.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 12.18''': Many animals, like this polar bear, have special body features that help them live in a certain environment.]]

Other organisms have special features that help them hunt for food or avoid being the food of another organism. For example, when zebras in a herd run away from lions, the zebras' dark stripes confuse the lions and make it hard for them to focus on just one zebra during the chase. Hummingbirds have long thin beaks that help them drink nectar from flowers. Some plants have poisonous or foul-tasting substances in them that keep animals from eating them.

==Adaptations and Evolution==
The characteristics of an organism that help it survive in a given environment are called '''adaptations'''. Adaptations develop when certain variations in a population help some members survive better than others (Figure 12.19). Often the variation comes from a mutation, or a random change in an organism's genes. The ones that survive pass favorable traits on to their '''offspring'''.

[[File:Mutation and selection diagram.svg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 12.19''': An explanation of how adaptations develop.]]

To help you understand adaptation, think about a population of oak trees. Imagine that most of the trees are easily killed by a certain fungus but that every now and then, there is one tree that has a natural ability to survive the fungus. That one tree displays a variation that gives it a better chance of surviving its environment. It also has a better chance of living to produce seeds and have offspring. It will reproduce and carry on the species, while the other trees will die off. The tree with the natural ability to resist the fungus will pass that trait on to its offspring. The other trees will not live and have offspring. Eventually the population will change so that most of the individual trees have the trait to survive the fungus. This is an adaptation. Adaptations are inherited traits that an organism gets from its parents. Over time traits that help an organism survive become more common. Traits that hinder survival eventually disappear.

Changes and adaptations in a species accumulate over time. Eventually the descendants are very different from their ancestors and may become a whole new species. Changes in a species over time are called evolution. We learn about evolution from the fossil record. It shows us that many of the life forms that live today developed from earlier, different life forms. For example, horse fossils show us that about 60 million years ago horses were much smaller than they are today (Figure 12.20). Fossils also show us that horses' teeth and hooves have changed several times as horses have adapted to changes in the environment.

[[File:Warmblood.JPG|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 12.20''': The horse has evolved over the last 60 million years. Horses today are much larger than earlier horses.]]

==Studying the Fossil Record==
Like the organisms that were represented in Walcott's fossils, many of the organisms that once lived on Earth are now extinct. Earth's overall environmental conditions have changed many times since the Cambrian, and many organisms did not have the traits to survive the changes. Those that did survive the changes passed traits on to their offspring. They gave rise to the species that live today.

We study fossils to learn about how species responded to change over the Earth's long history. Fossils show us that simple organisms dominated life on Earth for its first 3 billion years. Then, between 1 and 2 billion years ago, the first multi-cellular organisms appeared on Earth. Life forms gradually evolved and became more complex. During the Cambrian period, animals became more '''diverse''' and complex. We sometimes refer to this part of the Phanerozoic Eon as the Cambrian Explosion&amp;mdash;meaning a time when the Earth &quot;exploded&quot; with incredible numbers of new complex life forms.

==Phanerozoic Eon==
The Phanerozoic Eon is divided into three chunks of time called eras—the Paleozoic, the Mesozoic, and the Cenozoic (Table (12.1). They span from about 540 million years ago to the present. We live now in the Cenozoic Era. The table below shows how life has changed during the long span of the Phanerozoic Eon. Notice that different types of organisms developed at different times. However, all organisms evolved from a common ancestor. Life gradually became more diverse and new species branched out from that common ancestor. Most modern organisms evolved from species that are now extinct. To get an idea of how an organism can change from a single common ancestor to many different types, think about all the different types of dogs. All dogs evolved from a common wolf ancestor. Today there are hundreds of varieties of dogs that all look very different.

The eras of the Phanerozoic Eon are separated by events called mass extinctions. A mass extinction occurs when large numbers of organisms become extinct in a short amount of time. Between the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic, nearly 95% of all species on Earth died off. The cause or causes of this extinction are still being debated.

Between the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic, about 50% of all animal species on Earth died off. This mass extinction, 65 million years ago, is the one in which the dinosaurs became extinct. Although there are other hypotheses, most scientists think that this mass extinction took place when a giant meteorite struck Earth with the energy of the most powerful nuclear weapon. The impact kicked up a massive dust cloud. When the particles rained back onto the surface they heated the atmosphere until it became as hot as a kitchen oven, roasting animals. Dust that remained in the atmosphere blocked sunlight for a year or more, causing a deep freeze and ending photosynthesis. Sulfur from the impact mixed with water in the atmosphere to form acid rain, which dissolved the shells of the tiny marine plankton that form the base of the food chain. With little food being produced by land plants and plankton, animals starved. Carbon dioxide was also released from the impact and eventually caused global warming. Life forms could not survive the dramatic temperature swings.

Earth's climate changed numerous times during the Phanerozoic Eon. Just before the beginning of the Phanerozoic, much of the Earth was cold and covered with '''glaciers''' (Figure 12.21). As the Phanerozoic began, however, the climate was changing to a warm and '''tropical''' one (Figure 12.22). The glaciers were replaced with tropical seas. This allowed the Cambrian Explosion of many new life forms on Earth. During the Phanerozoic, Earth's climate has gone through at least 4 major cycles between times of cold glaciers and times of warm tropical seas. Some organisms survived environmental changes in the climate; others became extinct when the climate changed beyond their capacity to cope with it.

[[File:PeritoMoreno011.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 12.21''': Just before the Phanerozoic, many parts of Earth were covered with glaciers. After the Earth began to warm and many of the glaciers melted, there was an explosion of new life on Earth. The glaciers in this picture are from the present. However, glaciers are much less common on Earth today than at other times in Earth's history.]]

[[File:Temperate rainforest 2004-04-09.jpeg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 12.22''': The Phanerozoic Eon was often characterized by times of warm tropical climates. The age of the dinosaurs was especially mild for most of the Earth. This allowed plants and animals to spread over large areas of land. This picture shows plants in a modern rainforest. Plants of the Phanerozoic may have looked similar.]]

==Lesson Summary==
* Adaptations are favorable traits that organisms inherit. Adaptations develop from variations within a population and help organisms to survive in their given environment.
* Changes in populations accumulate over time; this is called evolution.
* The fossil record shows us that present day life forms evolved from earlier different life forms. It shows us that the first organisms on Earth were simple bacteria that dominated the Earth for several billion years.
* Beginning about 540 million years ago more complex organisms developed on Earth. During the Phanerozoic Eon all of the plant and animal types we know today have evolved.
* Many types of organisms that once lived are now extinct. Eart's overall environment, especially the climate, has changed many times, and organisms change too over time.

==Review Questions==
# Describe what is meant by adaptation.
# The first animals on Earth had soft bodies. Gradually many animal species evolved that had hard outer parts called exoskeletons covering their bodies. How might an exoskeleton be a favorable adaptation?
# Explain why unfavorable traits do not usually get passed to offspring.
# List the order in which the major types of animals appeared on Earth.
# How might climate have affected the ability of plants to grow over large areas during a given time?
# One cause of mass extinctions is meteorite or comet impacts. What might be some additional causes of mass extinctions?

== Introduction ==

A standalone SPM is a version of SPM that has been compiled using the MATLAB Compiler, see:
* http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/
so that it does not require the availability of a MATLAB licence.

A standalone version of SPM12 is available upon request for most platforms (Windows, Linux and MacOS 64 bit). Please contact [mailto:fil.spm@ucl.ac.uk?Subject=SPM%20Standalone fil.spm@ucl.ac.uk].

== Installation ==

Following your request, you will be given instructions to download the following components:

* The '''MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR)''' v4.13, corresponding to MATLAB R2010a ''for your architecture'': there are subfolders in the ''MCR'' folder for 32- and 64-bit Windows (win32, win64), Linux (glnx86, glnxa64), and 64-bit Mac (maci64). On Windows platforms, if you don't have Microsoft Visual C++ runtime components installed, you might also need to download the vcredist_*.exe file from the same folder.
* The '''Component Technology File (CTF)''' containing the compiled SPM, as a ZIP file.

=== Installation of the MCR ===

You need to do this operation only once, even if you use several versions of standalone SPM.

Run the MCRInstaller executable you downloaded and follow the instructions.

Windows installation requires to have administrative privileges and you might also have to install the Visual C++ Redistributable Package (''vcredist_*.exe''), that can be found in the same folder as the MCRInstaller. We also recommend you restart Windows at this point.

If you run into problems, or want to learn more, see:
* http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/compiler/br2jauc-13.html#br2jauc-16

To install the MCR on Linux from the command line, type:
 chmod 755 MCRInstaller.bin
 ./MCRInstaller.bin -P bean421.installLocation=&quot;MCR&quot; -silent

=== Installation of the CTF ===

Unzip the ''spm12_rxxx.zip'' archive containing the SPM Component Technology File (CTF) in an appropriate folder. It contains a number of small executables for each supported platform and a large ''spm12.ctf'' file containing the compiled version of SPM12 itself.

The first time the standalone application will be executed, the CTF file will be unpacked in a subfolder so if you installed the CTF in a folder that requires administrative permission for write access, you should execute the application once under those privileges -- see below.

On Mac, you also need to unzip the ''spm12_maci64.zip'' archive.

== Usage ==

To start SPM graphical user interface:
* on Windows: double-click on spm12_wxx.exe
* on Linux, type
 ./run_spm12.sh /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v713/
where the argument is the path to your MCR installation.
* on Mac, type
 ./run_spm12.sh /Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v713/
where the argument is the path to your MCR installation.

The first execution should take longer to start as the CTF file will be unpacked. When installing SPM system-wide, you should do the first unpacker execution as root, i.e.
 ./run_spm12.sh /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v713/ quit

On Linux/Mac, you can edit the Shell script run_spm12.sh to hardcode the location of the MCR installation, thus removing the need of providing it on the command line.

The other arguments that can be used are the modality (as in `''spm fmri''`) or the keyword `''batch''` to start directly the batch system window, e.g.:
 ./run_spm12.sh /Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v713/ fmri
 ./run_spm12.sh /Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v713/ batch

Furthermore, `''batch''` followed by a batch filename (''*.mat'' or ''*.m'') will start SPM, execute the batch and quit:
 ./run_spm12.sh /Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v713/ batch mybatch.mat

You can create a shortcut on your Desktop that already contains one of these arguments for a faster launch.

On Linux, for achieving menu entries, you can install an appropriate .desktop file and an icon file for SPM.
For example, save the following as spm12.desktop (modify according to your needs/MCR version):

  [Desktop Entry]
  Name=spm12
  GenericName=SPM12
  Comment=Statistical Parametric Mapping
  Exec=/usr/local/SPM/spm12/run_spm12.sh /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v717
  Icon=spm
  Terminal=false
  Type=Application
  Categories=Education;Science;

Additionally get the SPM icon from http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/favicon.ico and convert it to an png file, name it spm.png (this is the one referred to in the .desktop file as icon).

Then (package xdg-utils required) execute in a terminal:
  xdg-desktop-menu install --novendor spm12.desktop
  xdg-icon-resource install --novendor --size 32 spm.png

To deinstall desktop and icon file run
  xdg-icon-resource uninstall --size 32 spm
  xdg-desktop-menu uninstall spm12.desktop

== Trouble-shooting ==

* Why do I receive an error regarding missing mclmcrrt7x.dll ?

The first thing to try is restarting your computer, if you haven't already, since Windows can fail to find this dll even when the path is correctly set if it hasn't been restarted. If you still have problems, see:
http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-1IW46N/

* What to do if I get the error &quot;''Unable to obtain exclusive lock on CTF directory because of a file access error.''&quot;?

You need to set variable MCR_INHIBIT_CTF_LOCK to 1, see [http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/109-why-does-the-project_mcr-folder-extracted-from-a-ctf-file-compiled-with-matlab-7-5-r2007b-keep-g this].

* What to do if I get the error &quot;''readlink: illegal option -- f''&quot; on a Mac?

Change the last line of run_spm8.sh so that it reads:
 `dirname $0`/${MACAPP}spm8_${MWE_ARCH} $*

* How to have the standalone version using a single computational thread?

All recent versions of  the standalone SPM are compiled with the ''&quot;-R -singleCompThread&quot;'' flag in mcc so that they will use a single thread at runtime.

Previous version r4290, was not using this compilation option so you might want to have your MATLAB script to start with ''maxNumCompThreads(1);'' to have the same effect.

* Why do I get a warning &quot;''Process manager already initialized -- can't fully enable headless mode.''&quot; followed by a crash on Mac OS?

Try installing [http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/ XQuartz] (you must logout and back in again after installing XQuartz).

* What to do if I get the error &quot;''Error: libXp.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory''&quot;?

You need to install the package containing libXp on your Linux platform:
 yum install libXp.x86_64

* What to do if I get the error &quot;''This process is attempting to exclude an item from Time Machine by path without administrator privileges. This is not supported.''&quot;?

Run the standalone as root once, i.e. start the command line with ''sudo''.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* Will it run faster?

No: http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-1ARNS/

* Is it possible to add other SPM toolboxes?

No: only core SPM toolboxes are available, contributed SPM toolboxes are not present and cannot be added without a whole recompilation.

* How to compile the SPM standalone by myself?

Have a look at ''config/spm_make_standalone.m'' and ''spm_standalone.m'' in your SPM installation.

Open MATLAB, at the command line, addpath the spm directory (if not done already), goto the config subdirectory, and run spm_make_standalone. You will need to wait some minutes. Matlab needs either the Signal Processing Toolbox installed, or in spm_make_standalone.m the line with '-N','-p',fullfile(matlabroot,'toolbox','signal') needs to be deleted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}
Water is a simple compound, made of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen bonded together. More than any other substance on the Earth, water is important to life and has remarkable properties. Without water, life could probably not even exist on Earth. When looking at Earth from space, the abundance of water on Earth becomes obvious&amp;mdash;see Figure 13.1. On land, water is also common: it swirls and meanders through streams, falls from the sky, freezes into snow flakes, and even makes up most of you and me. In this chapter, we'll look at the distribution of water on Earth, and also examine some of its unique properties.

[[File:Earth Western Hemisphere.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.1''': Earth, the &quot;Blue Marble&quot;, can be seen in this photograph to be mostly covered with liquid water.]]

==Lesson Objectives==
* Describe how water is distributed on Earth.
* Describe what powers the water cycle and how water moves through this cycle.

==Distribution of Earth's Water==
As Figure 13.1 makes clear, water is the most abundant substance on the Earth's surface. About 71% of the Earth's surface is covered with water, most of which is found in the oceans. In fact, 97% of Earth's water, nearly all of it, is in the Earth's oceans. This means that just 3% of Earth's water is '''fresh water''', water with low concentrations of salts (Figure 13.2). Most freshwater is found as ice in the vast glaciers of Greenland and the immense ice sheets of Antarctica. That leaves just 0.6% of Earth's water that is freshwater that humans can easily use. Most liquid freshwater is found under the Earth's surface as groundwater, while the rest is found in lakes, rivers, and streams, and water vapor in the sky.

[[File:Earth's water distribution.svg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.2''': Earth's water is mostly in the oceans. Fresh water is only 3% of all the Earth's water, and most of that is in the form of ice.]]

==Three States of Water==
Water is a special substance. It is abundant on Earth and frequently appears as a gas, liquid, and solid. It is one of the few substances on Earth that is frequently found in all three phases of matter. Moreover, it can readily cycle through the globe: the same molecule can travel through many different regions on Earth.

Part of the reason that water is unique is because of its melting point and boiling point. Under normal atmospheric conditions, water freezes at 0&amp;deg;C (32&amp;deg;F) and boils at 100&amp;deg;C (212&amp;deg;F). Because of our Earth's position in the solar system, Earth’s temperature varies from far below the melting point of water to well above that melting point. Even though water does not boil at normal temperatures, it often becomes gaseous water vapor by evaporating. All this means that we frequently see water in its three phases on Earth (See Figures 13.3, 13.4, and 13.5).

[[File:Iceberg 12 2000 08 13.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.3''': Solid ice floating amidst liquid water. This image shows what an iceberg might look like if you could see both above and below the surface.]]
[[File:Water droplet blue bg05.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.4''': Liquid water.]]
[[File:Above the Clouds.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.5''': Water vapor is invisible to our eyes. However, we can see the clouds that form when water vapor condenses.]]

==The Water Cycle==
The water on Earth moves about the Earth in what is known as the '''water cycle''' (Figure 13.6). Because it is a cycle, there truly is no beginning and no end. The very same water molecule found in your glass of water today has probably been on the Earth for billions of years. It may have been in a glacier or far below the ground. It may have been high up in the atmosphere and deep in the belly of a dinosaur. Who knows where it will end up today, when you're done with it!

[[File:Water cycle.png|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.6''': Water on Earth is constantly in motion.]]

Let's study Figure 13.6 for a moment. The Sun, many millions of kilometers away, provides the energy which drives the water cycle. Since the ocean holds most of the Earth's water, let's begin there. As you can see in the illustration, water in the ocean evaporates as water vapor into the air. The salt in the ocean does not evaporate with the water, however, so the water vapor is fresh. Some of the invisible water vapor in the air '''condenses''' to form liquid droplets in clouds. The clouds are blown about the globe by wind. As the water particles in the clouds collide and grow, they fall from the sky as '''precipitation'''. Precipitation can occur in forms such as rain, sleet, hail, and snow. Sometimes precipitation falls right back into the ocean. Other times, however, it falls onto the solid earth as freshwater.

That freshwater, now on the Earth, may be found in a solid form as snow or ice. Some of it goes directly back into the air to form water vapor and clouds again. However, most of this solid water sits atop mountains and slowly melts over time to provide a steady flow of freshwater to streams, rivers, and lakes below. Some of that water enters the Earth's '''groundwater''', seeping below the surface through pores in the ground. This water can form '''aquifers''' that store freshwater for centuries. Alternatively, it may come to the surface through springs or find its way back to the oceans.

When water falls from the sky is rain it form streams and rivers that flow downward to oceans and lakes. People use these natural resources as their source of water. They also create canals, aqueducts, dams, and wells to direct water to living areas to meet their needs (Figure 13.7). Sometimes, our manipulation or pollution of water greatly affects other species. Many scientists are seeking better ways of using Earth's water in a sustainable and efficient way.

[[File:Hoover dam.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.7''': Hoover Dam on the Colorado River.]]

Obviously, people are not the only creatures that rely on water. Plants and animals also depend on this vital resource. Plants play an important role in the water cycle because they release large amounts of water vapor into the air from their leaves. This process of '''transpiration''' moves liquid water from plants into the air. You can see transpiration in action if you cover a few leaves on a plant with a plastic bag. Within a few hours, water vapor released from the leaves will have condensed onto the surface of the bag.

==Lesson Summary==
* Earth's surface is mostly water covered. Most of that water is in our oceans, leaving only 3% freshwater.
* Water exists on Earth in all three phases: solid, liquid, and gas.
* The water cycle moves water from the hydrosphere to the atmosphere to the land and back again.
* The major processes of the water cycle include evaporation and transpiration, condensation, precipitation and return to the oceans via runoff and groundwater supplies.

==Review Questions==
# About what percent of the Earth's water is fresh water?
# About what percent of all of Earth's water is found in groundwater, streams, lakes, and rivers?
# Explain the following statement: The water on other planets is present in a different form than on Earth.
# What powers the water cycle?
# In what state would water be found at 130&amp;deg;C? What state would water be at -45&amp;deg;C?
# Define the words condensation and evaporation.
# Summarize the water cycle.
# Why do you think the atmosphere is so important to the water cycle?
# Suppose the sun grew much stronger in intensity. How would this affect the water cycle?

: Water that is found beneath the Earth's surface, between soil or rock particles.
; precipitation
: Water that falls to the Earth from the sky. Precipitation usually takes the form of rain, but can also occur as snow, sleet, or hail.
; transpiration
: The release of water vapor into the air through the leaves of plants; sometimes called evapotranspiration.
; water cycle
: The cycle through which water moves around the Earth, changing both its phase (between solid to liquid to gas) and its location (in the oceans, in clouds, in streams and lakes, and in groundwater). 
; water vapor
: Water in the form of a gas. Water vapor is invisible to humans; when we see clouds, we actually are seeing liquid water in the clouds.

==Points to Consider==
* How does precipitation affect the topography of the Earth?
* What natural disasters are caused by the water cycle?
* How might pollution affect creatures far from the source of the pollution?
* How might building dams disrupt the natural water cycle?
* If the temperature of the Earth increases through global warming, how might the water cycle be altered?

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}
As we've learned, some of the freshwater on the Earth is on the surface, in streams, rivers, ponds and lakes. This freshwater is tremendously important to humans, plants, and animals. Wetlands are areas where water bodies and land meet. Wetlands contain high biodiversity and play a key role in naturally removing pollutants from water. At times, surface waters flood, which often creates hazardous conditions for people on the ground.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Compare streams and rivers and their importance.
* Describe what ponds and lakes are, and why they are important.
* Explain why wetlands are significant in the water cycle, and describe their biodiversity.
* Describe the causes of floods and their effects.

==Streams and Rivers==
A '''stream''' is a body of moving water confined by a bottom (or bed) and earthen sides (or banks). There are many categories of streams including creeks, brooks, tributaries, bayous, and rivers&amp;mdash;all of these types of streams vary in their size, depth, speed, and location. Streams are always-changing natural objects where water flows downhill, taking turns through hills and plains as elevation, rock type, and topography guide the stream along. They are responsible for a great deal of erosion and can create great canyons over time, as they slowly move soil, pebbles, and even boulders downstream.

===Parts of a Stream===
The place at which a stream originates is called the '''source'''; this is often a spring but it could be the top of a mountain. When two streams come together, the point where they join is called a '''confluence'''. The smaller of the two streams is considered a '''tributary''' of the larger stream. A '''pool''' in a stream is somewhat like a swimming pool — it's a slow part in the stream where water moves more slowly, so that the stream spreads out and becomes deeper. Finally, the point at which a stream comes into a large body of water, like an ocean or a lake is called the '''mouth'''. These areas are called '''estuaries''', and they oftentimes form unique ecosystems where water from the stream and the lake or ocean mix together (Figure 13.8).

===Rivers===
Rivers are the largest type of stream, and move large amounts of water through landscapes from higher to lo through landscapes from higher to lower elevations. North America has several '''divides''' that separate the land up into separate water basins (Figure 13.9). In each of these sections, rivers will eventually run to the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, the Great Lakes, Arctic Ocean, or the Gulf of Mexico. Most rivers are bordered by '''floodplains''', which are flat areas that flood when rivers overflow their banks.

[[File:NorthAmericaDivides.gif|frame|center|'''Figure 13.9''': The divides of North America.]]

Rivers generally move a lot of water. The Amazon River, the world's river with the greatest flow, has a flow rate of nearly 220,000 cubic meters per second! By comparison, at Niagara Falls, nearly 1,800 cubic meters of water fall per second (Figure 13.10).

[[File:Canadian Falls Aug 2004.JPG|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.10''': The famous Horseshoe Falls at Niagara Falls drops over 1,800 cubic meters of water per second, down a cliff nearly 50 meters (170 feet) in height. The falls are fed by Lake Erie and the Niagara River.]]

Since rivers contain so much water, humans have used them since the beginning of civilization as a source of water, food, transportation, defense, power, recreation, and waste disposal. The water you drink probably comes from a reservoir fed by rivers. The electricity in your house may also come from power plants that use rivers to generate power. Obviously, the natural areas along by rivers are affected by humans use or misuse of the rivers. Sometimes entire populations of organisms can be destroyed by pollution of a river many miles upstream. Table 13.1 shows the ten longest rivers in the world.

==Ponds and Lakes==
Streams and rivers, by definition, are bodies of water that have a current; they are in constant motion. Ponds and lakes, on the other hand, do not (Figure 13.11). They are generally bordered by hills or low rises, so that the water is blocked from flowing directly downhill. They represent yet another important resource for humans and another area in need of conservation.

[[File:Hampstead Ponds (171329664).jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.11''': Ponds are small, enclosed bodies of water.]]

Though the word '''pond''' refers to water that does not constantly flow downhill, there is disagreement about the exact definition of a pond. It is generally agreed, however, that a pond is a small body of freshwater. You probably wouldn't need a boat to get across it, and you might be able to stand up in it. Little or no surface water would escape from the pond through streams, and they are often fed by underground springs.

Lakes are larger bodies of freshwater formed by some natural process like tectonic plate movement, landslides, or human actions, such as building a dam. Almost all lakes are freshwater, and water usually leaves the lake through a river or a stream. All lakes lose some water to evaporation.

Some lakes are so large that they have their own tidal systems and currents, and can affect weather patterns. The Great Lakes in the United States, for example, contain 22% of the world's fresh surface water (Figure 13.12). The largest of the Great Lakes, Lake Superior, has a tide that rises and falls several centimeters each day. The Great Lakes are large enough to change the entire weather system in the Northeast region of the United States, in what is known as the &quot;lake effect&quot;. They are home to countless species of fish and wildlife as well.

[[File:Great Lakes from space.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.12''': The Great Lakes are the largest lakes in the world. They are found along the border of the United States of America and Canada.]]

Lakes can be formed in a variety of different ways. Some lakes, like The Great Lakes fill depressions eroded as glaciers scraped soil and rock out from the landscape. Lakes known as crater lakes, formed in volcanic calderas that have filled up with precipitation. Rift lakes are formed in cracks created by tectonic faults. And subglacial lakes are found below a frozen ice cap. As a result of geologic history and the arrangement of land masses on the Earth, most lakes are in the Northern Hemisphere. In fact, over 60% of all the world's lakes are in Canada — most of these lakes were formed by the glaciers that covered most of Canada in the last Ice Age.

'''Limnology''' is the study of all bodies of freshwater and the organisms that live there. The ecosystem of a lake is divided into three distinct sections (Figure 13.13):

# The littoral zone, which is the sloped area closest to the edge of the water.
# The open-water zone (also called the photic or limnetic zone), where sunlight is abundant.
# The deep-water zone (also called the aphotic or profundal zone), where little or no sunlight can reach.

[[File:Primary zones of a lake.png|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.13''': The three primary zones of a lake are the littoral, open-water, and deep-water zones.]]

Much life is found in the littoral zone, because sunlight allows the growth of plants on the lake bed. These plants in turn, provide food and shelter to animals like snails, insects, and fish. Other plants and fish such as bass and trout live in the open-water zone. The deep-water zone does not allow for plants to grow, so fewer organisms live there. In this zone, most organisms are scavengers like crabs and catfish, which feed on dead organisms that fall to the bottom. Fungi and bacteria aid in the decomposition of those dead organisms, too. Though different creatures live in the oceans, ocean waters also have these same divisions based on sunlight with similar types of creatures that live in each of the zones.

Lakes are not always permanent features of a landscape. Some '''intermittent lakes''' come and go with the seasons, as water levels rise and fall. Over a longer time period, lakes can disappear when they are filled in with sediments, if the springs or streams that fill them diminish, or if their outlets grow due to erosion. When the climate of an area alters, lakes can either expand or shrink, and lakes may disappear altogether if  precipitation significantly diminishes.

==Wetlands==
The word '''wetland''' is well-named. It refers to land that holds a great deal of water for significant periods of time, and that contains specialized plants able to grow in these wet conditions. Wetlands are created where bodies of water and bodies of land meet. They can be large flat areas or relatively small and steep areas. Wetlands tend to create unique ecosystems that rely on both the land and the water for survival. Wetlands are important regions of biological diversity, yet they can also be fragile systems that are sensitive to the amounts and quality of water.

===Types of Wetlands===
A marsh is a type of wetland usually around lakes, ponds, streams, or the ocean where grasses and reeds are common but trees are not (Figure 13.14). Animals present in marshes usually include frogs, turtles, muskrats, and many varieties of birds. The water in a marsh is generally shallow and may be either freshwater or saltwater.

[[File:Long Point Marshes 2.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.14''': A marsh is a treeless wetland.]]

A swamp is a wetland characterized by lush trees and vines in a low-lying area beside slow-moving rivers (Figure 13.15). Like marshes, they are frequently or always inundated with water. Since the water in a swamp moves slowly, oxygen in the water is often scarce, so plants and animals must be adapted for these low-oxygen conditions. Swamps can be freshwater, saltwater, or a mixture of both.

[[File:CypressSwamp.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.15''': A swamp is characterized by trees in still water.]]

An estuary is an area where saltwater from the sea mixes with freshwater from a stream or river (Figure 13.16). These semi-enclosed areas are home to plants and animals that can tolerate the sharp changes in salt content that the constant motion and mixing of waters creates. Estuaries contain '''brackish''' water, which has more salt than freshwater but less than sea water. Because estuaries contain areas of water with many different levels of dissolved salt, they tend to have many different habitats for plants and animals. As a result, estuaries have extremely high biodiversity.

[[File:Susquehanna ETM 19990923 lrg.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.16''': Chesapeake Bay, surrounded by Maryland and Virginia, is the largest estuary in the United States.]]

===Ecological Role of Wetlands===
As mentioned above, wetlands are home to many different species of organisms. Though they make up only 5% of the area of the United States, wetlands contain more than 30% of the plant types found in the United States. Many endangered species live in wetlands, and therefore many wetlands are protected from human use.

Wetlands also play a key biological role by removing pollutants from water. For example, they can trap and use fertilizer that has rushed off a farmer's fields, and therefore prevent that fertilizer from contaminating another body of water. Since wetlands naturally purify water, preserving wetlands also helps to maintain clean supplies of water.

==Floods==
Floods are a natural part of the water cycle, but they can be terrifying forces of destruction. Put most simply, a flood is an overflow of water in one place. Floods can occur for a variety of different ways, and their effects can be minimized in several different ways. Perhaps unsurprisingly, floods tend to affect low-lying areas most severely.

===Causes of Floods===
Floods usually occur when precipitation occurs more quickly than that water can be absorbed into the ground or carried away by rivers or streams. Flooding may be sudden and unexpected, in the case of a flash flood, when very intense rainfall occurs in an area (Figure 13.17). This strong rainfall will fall too fast to be absorbed into the ground, and will overflow the banks of the streams and rivers. Alternately, floods can occur more slowly, when a long period of rainfall fills the ground with water and the levels of rivers and streams gradually rises. Less commonly, floods can occur when a dam breaks along a reservoir&amp;mdash;as you might expect, this type of flooding can be catastrophic. In California, floods commonly occur when rainfall far exceeds annual averages, such as during an El Niño year. High water levels have also caused small dams to break, wreaking havoc downstream.

[[File:Boscastle RAF SeaKing.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.17''': A flash flood in England in 2004 was caused by three and a half inches of rain that fell in just 60 minutes. It devastated two villages.]]

Vegetation is an important factor in determining whether a flood occurs. Plants tend to slow down the water that runs over the land, giving it time to enter the ground. Even if the ground is too wet to absorb more water, plants still slow the water's passage across the earth, increasing the time between rainfall and the water's arrival in a stream. For the same
reason, wetlands also play a key role in minimizing the impacts of floods; they act as a buffer between land and high water levels. Flooding is therefore less common in areas that are heavily vegetated, and can be more severe in areas that have been recently logged.

===Effects of Floods===
[[File:Hurricane Katrina August 28 2005 NASA.jpg|250px|thumb|'''Figure 13.18''': Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was one of the deadliest storms in United States history.]]

The most recent catastrophic flooding in United States history occurred in New Orleans in 2005, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina (Figure 13.18). This flooding occurred because of the failure of the city's '''levees''', raised structures designed to hold back a river or lake. The New Orleans levees were poorly designed, and broke in multiple places after the storm, allowing water to pour into the city (Figure 13.19). Ultimately, over 80% of the city was submerged, 90% of city residents evacuated, and over 1800 people died in the disaster.

[[File:Katrina-14890.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.19''': Levees that held back flood water were broken in many key areas around the city of New Orleans.]]
{{clear}}
Not all the consequences of flooding are negative. Floods deposit sediment in their floodplains, and these sediments are nutrient rich and good for farming. Therefore, many farmers today grow crops in the floodplains of major rivers. This pattern of rain and flooding was also important to such peoples as the ancient Egyptians along the Nile River.

Floods are also responsible for moving large amounts of sediments about within streams. These sediments provide habitats for animals, and the periodic movement of sediment is crucial to the lives of several types of organisms. Many plants and fish along the Colorado River, for example, depend on seasonal flooding to rearrange sand bars.

==Lesson Summary==
* One way water returns to the oceans is through rivers and streams.
* Streams begin in higher elevations, with many tributaries joining together as it flows to lower elevations.
* A mature river will develop a floodplain and may eventually form a delta where the river meets the ocean.
* Water temporarily resides in ponds and lakes, which are mostly freshwater.
* Scientists study lakes, wetlands, and estuaries because they are biologically important areas.
* Flooding is part of the natural cycle of all rivers, which enriches floodplains with important nutrients.
* Flooding produces difficulties for humans living on or near the floodplain and in coastal areas, particularly when levees break.

==Review Questions==
# Where do streams originate?
# Compare and contrast streams and rivers.
# What is an advantage and disadvantage of living in floodplains?
# Which of the ten longest rivers has the greatest rate of flow?
# Compare and contrast ponds and lakes.
# What are three main types of wetlands?
# Consider an animal common in swamps and an animal common in rivers. What natural adaptations do they each have to their habitat?
# Deserts are places that get little rain. Why are they in danger of flash floods at times?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Embedding Ruby ==

You can embed Ruby in your other C apps, though it is a bit tricky.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/239315/how-to-embed-ruby-in-c

is a good reference.
The most tricky part is I think you can only run it from your apps &quot;main&quot; thread or else it won't do its stack-traversal for garbage collection right.  This may not be the case with jruby or Rubinius et al, and possibly might not be the case for 1.9, too (might work there).

Basically you can call any &quot;rb_&quot; method defined in ruby.h after calling init, and they all return you a VALUE object (ruby object).

NB that you can call from ruby into C by writing a C extension.   That is the standard way to go.

:[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''': while there's always the chance it could be developed further, keep in mind that [[MediaWiki Developer's Handbook]], [[MediaWiki Administrator's Handbook]] and [[MediaWiki User Guide]] are all competing against those three same divisions of content (developer, administrator, and user) that [[mw:|MediaWiki]] uses to organize its content.  In fact, the coverage of MediaWiki is exactly what the MediaWiki wiki is all about.  I personally believe that these three books are basically the equivalent to having MediaWiki.org as a sub-project of Wikibooks and that [[WB:WIW]] should be updated to exclude these books.  I would support using existing material to supplement the Help namespace material but I do not support duplication of efforts between WMF projects. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:16, 20 June 2010 (UTC)

::{{comment}} One thing to keep in mind is the the difference between the two wiki's.  The pages at mediawiki.org will probably never have linear page ordering with navigation, (I don't think) it is not possible to organize the pages there into collections and order pedia press copies, and they will probably never aim to have a pdf or print versions of their work.  I won't be heart broken if we delete this book (because it so under developed relative to the competition), but I don't think the documentation there is ever meant to be developed into a ''book'', but just a wiki.

::: I'm afraid I don't agree with Adrignola here. As Thenub said, a documentation and a book are different. Also, a Wikibook on the same thing can be more textbook-like so that they go from the basics to the tougher bits.

::::{{comment}} I have been recently rethinking this issue to see if there is some room to compromise.  I think it should be noted that [[User:Xypron|Xypron]] is a main contributor in the book, and as such his opinion is important.  Additionally I agree we should try to duplicate effort.  But when I read through the &quot;case studies&quot; section of [[MediaWiki Developer's Handbook/Add JavaScript]] I think to myself that this is an excellent example of how a textbook and a manual can be different.  But then again I am no technical expert in this field, so I want to be careful.  So let me ask [[User:Xypron|Xypron]] or anyone familiar, are there examples of simple, heavily comment code like this at MediaWiki Manual?  If not, do they have a place there in the manual there, or is a section like this more suited to wikibooks? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 11:06, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Solutions to '''Physical Properties of Crystals''' by [[:w:en:John Nye (scientist)|J. F. Nye]] (ISBN 9780198511656)

The Book already contains solutions to the exercises. However the solutions are rather short and not very detailed. The solutions provided here are more detailed.

The book uses the [[:w:en:Einstein notation|Einstein notation]].

=== Exercise 1.1 ===
p.15

'''Problem''': If &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; are vectors, then &lt;math&gt;p_1/q_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_2/q_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_3/q_3&lt;/math&gt; are three numbers whose values are defined for any set of axes. Are they the components of a vector?

'''Solution''': If &lt;math&gt;p_i/q_i&lt;/math&gt; are components of a vector they should transform like the components of a vector. See Table 2 p. 13 &lt;math&gt;p_i' = a_{ij}p_j&lt;/math&gt;

A transformation with &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p_i' = a_{ij}p_j&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q_i' = a_{ij}q_j&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_i'}{q_i'} = \frac{a_{ij}p_j}{a_{ij}q_j} = \frac{p_j}{q_j} \ne a_{ij} \frac{p_j}{q_j}&lt;/math&gt;

shows that &lt;math&gt;p_i/q_i&lt;/math&gt; are not the components of a vector.

'''Answer''': No, because they do not transform like vector components.

=== Exercise 1.2 ===
p.22

=== Exercise 1.3 ===
p. 31

==== [1] ====
'''Problem:'''
Electrical conductivity tensor with axes &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} \sigma_{ij} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 25 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 7 &amp; -3\sqrt{3} \\ 0 &amp; -3\sqrt{3} &amp; 13\end{bmatrix} \cdot 10^7 \mathrm{ohm}^{-1}\mathrm{m}^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;
is transformed to a new set of axes &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt; with the following angles

&lt;math&gt;x_1'Ox_1=0^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_2'Ox_2=30^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_2'Ox_3=60^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_3'Ox_3=30^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;.

Draw up a transformation table similar to (11) on p.9 and check that the sum of the squares of &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; for each row and column is 1.


'''Solution''': It follows from the given angles that &lt;math&gt;x_3'Ox_2 = 30^{\circ} + 60^{\circ} + 30^{\circ} = 120^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; consists of the direction cosines of the angles:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} a_{ij} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \cos(0^{\circ}) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \cos(30^{\circ}) &amp; \cos(60^{\circ}) \\ 0 &amp; \cos(120^{\circ}) &amp; \cos(30^{\circ})\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \sqrt{3}/2 &amp; 1/2 \\ 0 &amp; -1/2 &amp; \sqrt{3}/2\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Checking the columns and rows

&lt;math&gt;\cos(0^{\circ})^2 = 1^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\cos(30^{\circ})^2 + \cos(60^{\circ})^2 = 3/4 + 1/4 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

'''Problem''': Transform &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}'&lt;/math&gt; and interpret the result.

'''Solution''': A second-rank tensor transforms according to (22) on p.11: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}' = a_{ik}a_{jl}\sigma_{kl}&lt;/math&gt;:

This can be reduced because we have some zero components in the electrical conductivity tensor &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;:
{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}'&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;= a_{i1}a_{j1} \overbrace{\sigma_{11}}^{25} + a_{i1}a_{j2} \overbrace{\sigma_{12}}^0 + a_{i1} a_{j3} \overbrace{\sigma_{13}}^0 +&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| || &lt;math&gt; + a_{i2} a_{j1} \overbrace{\sigma_{21}}^0 + a_{i2} a_{j2} \overbrace{\sigma_{22}}^7 + a_{i2} a_{j3} \overbrace{\sigma_{23}}^{-3\sqrt{3}} +&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| || &lt;math&gt; + a_{i3} a_{j1} \overbrace{\sigma_{31}}^0 + a_{i3} a_{j2} \overbrace{\sigma_{32}}^{-3\sqrt{3}} + a_{i3} a_{j3} \overbrace{\sigma_{33}}^{13}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| || &lt;math&gt;= a_{i1}a_{j1} 25 + a_{i2} a_{j2} 7 - a_{i2} a_{j3} 3\sqrt{3} - a_{i3} a_{j2} 3\sqrt{3} + a_{i3} a_{j3} 13&lt;/math&gt;
|}

now it is just a matter of calculating the components

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{11}' = \underbrace{ a_{11}a_{11} }_{1} 25 + \underbrace{\ldots}_0 = 25&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{12}' = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{13}' = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{21}' = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{22}' = \underbrace{a_{21}a_{21}}_0 25 + \underbrace{a_{22}a_{22}}_{3/4} 7 - \underbrace{a_{22}a_{23}}_{\sqrt{3}/4} 3\sqrt{3} - \underbrace{a_{23}a_{22}}_{\sqrt{3}/4} 3\sqrt{3} + \underbrace{a_{23}a_{23}}_{1/4} 13 = \frac{1}{4} \left( 21 - 9 - 9 + 13 \right) = 4&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{23}' = \underbrace{ a_{21} a_{31} }_0 25 + \underbrace{a_{22}a_{32}}_{-\sqrt{3}/2} 7 - \underbrace{a_{22} a_{33}}_{3/4} 3\sqrt{3} - \underbrace{a_{23} a_{32} }_{-1/4} 3\sqrt{3} + \underbrace{a_{23}a_{33}}_{\sqrt{3}/4} 13 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \left( -7 - 9 + 3 + 13 \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{31}' = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{32}' = \underbrace{a_{31}a_{21}}_0 25 + \underbrace{a_{32}a_{22}}_{-\sqrt{3}/4} 7 - \underbrace{a_{32}a_{23}}_{-1/4} 3\sqrt{3} - \underbrace{a_{33}a_{22}}_{3/4} 3\sqrt{3} + \underbrace{a_{33}a_{23}}_{\sqrt{3}/4} 13 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\left( -7 + 3 - 9 + 13\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{33}' = \underbrace{a_{31}a_{31}}_0 25 + \underbrace{a_{32}a_{32}}_{1/4} 7 - \underbrace{a_{32}a_{33}}_{-\sqrt{3}/4} 3\sqrt{3} - \underbrace{a_{33}a_{32}}_{-\sqrt{3}/4} 3\sqrt{3} + \underbrace{a_{33}a_{33}}_{3/4} 13 = \frac{1}{4}\left( 7 + 18 + 49\right) = 16&lt;/math&gt;

or written in array notation

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} \sigma_{ij}' \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 16 \end{bmatrix} \cdot 10^7 \mathrm{ohm}^{-1}\mathrm{m}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Interpretation''': The new set of axes &lt;math&gt;x_i'&lt;/math&gt; is the principle axes of the tensor.

==== [3] ====

==== [4] ====

==== [5] ====

'''Problem''': Radial vector &lt;math&gt;OP&lt;/math&gt; with direction cosines in &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; axes &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}0, &amp; \frac{1}{2}, &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. Find the electrical conductivity in that direction with an analytical expression.

'''Solution''': Get the vector components in the principle axes &lt;math&gt;x_i'&lt;/math&gt;: Using the transformation for polar vector components &lt;math&gt;l_i' = a_{ij} l_j&lt;/math&gt; leads to &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}0, &amp;\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, &amp;\frac{1}{2}\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. Using equation (32) on p.25 &lt;math&gt;\sigma = l_i^2\sigma_i&lt;/math&gt; gives us &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac{3}{4} 4\mathrm{ohm}^{-1}\mathrm{m}^{-1} + \frac{1}{4} 16\mathrm{ohm}^{-1}\mathrm{m}^{-1} = 7\mathrm{ohm}^{-1}\mathrm{m}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== [6] ====

'''Problem''': An electric field &lt;math&gt;E = 1\;\mathrm{volt}\mathrm{m}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is applied in direction &lt;math&gt;OP&lt;/math&gt;. Calculate the components of &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; and the current density &lt;math&gt;j_i&lt;/math&gt; along the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; axes.

'''Solution''': The components of the electric field are &lt;math&gt;E_i = l_i E&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;E_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E_2 = \frac{1}{2}\;\mathrm{volt}/\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E_3 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\;\mathrm{volt}/\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt;


The components of the current density are &lt;math&gt;j_i = \sigma_{ik} E_k = \sigma_{ik} l_k E&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;j_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;j_2 = \left( \frac{7}{2} - \frac{9}{2} \right) \cdot 10^7\mathrm{amps}/\mathrm{m}^2 = -10^7 \mathrm{amps}/\mathrm{m}^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;j_3 = \left( -\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{13\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) \mathrm{amps}/\mathrm{m}^2 = 5 \sqrt{3} \cdot 10^7 \mathrm{amps}/\mathrm{m}^2&lt;/math&gt;

==== [7] ====

'''Problem''': determine the magnitude and direction of the current density &lt;math&gt;j_i&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Solution''':

Magnitude: &lt;math&gt;j = \sqrt{ j_1^2 + j_2^2 + j_3^2 } = \sqrt{ 76 } \cdot 10^7 \mathrm{amps}\mathrm{m}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;

Direction: &lt;math&gt;j = \begin{pmatrix}0, &amp; -1/\sqrt{ 76 }, &amp; 5 \sqrt{3/76} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. It lies in the &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt; plane with angles &lt;math&gt;Ox_3 = \cos^{-1}(5 \sqrt{3/76}) \approx 6^{\circ} 35'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-Ox_2 = \cos^{-1}(1/\sqrt{ 76 }) \approx 83^{\circ} 25'&lt;/math&gt;.

==== [8] ====

'''Problem''': Repeat [6] and [7] but with the &lt;math&gt;x_i'&lt;/math&gt; axes.

'''Solution''': 

Components: &lt;math&gt;j_i = \sigma_i l_i E&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;j_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;j_2 = 4 \frac{1}{2} 10^7 \mathrm{amps}/\mathrm{m}^2 = 2 \cdot 10^7\mathrm{amps}/\mathrm{m}^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;j_3 = 16 \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} 10^7 \mathrm{amps}/\mathrm{m}^2 = 8 \sqrt{3} \cdot 10^7\mathrm{amps}/\mathrm{m}^2&lt;/math&gt;

Magnitude: &lt;math&gt;j = \sqrt{ 2^2 + 8^2 3 } 10^7\mathrm{amps}/\mathrm{m}^2 = 14 \cdot 10^7\mathrm{amps}/\mathrm{m}^2&lt;/math&gt;

Direction: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 0, &amp; 2/7, &amp; 4/7\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; with angles &lt;math&gt;Ox_2 = 73^{\circ} 24'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Ox_3 = 55^{\circ} 9'&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Everyone who is affected by a business is called a '''stakeholder'''.

== Internal Stakeholders ==
Internal stakeholders are inside the business. There are two you need to know:
;Owners
*The most important stakeholders.
*They decide what happens to the business. They're the ones who make a profit if the business is successful.
*In a sole trader or a partnership, they are the owners. In a limited company, they are the shareholders.
;Employees
*If the company does badly, they may become unemployed.
*They want job security, promotion prospects, a decent wage, and good working conditions.

== External Stakeholders ==
External stakeholders are outside the business. There are four main ones:
;Customers
*They want high quality products at low prices.
;Suppliers
*The business provides them with their income.
*They may face cash flow problems if the business doesn't pay on time.
*If the business closes, they will lose work and money.
;Local community
*The business provides job opportunities and may provide useful facilities which they can use (e.g. a gym)
*On the other hand, if the business causes noise and pollution, this will disrupt them (e.g. a power plant)
;Government
*They receive taxes when the business makes a profit.

== Why Stakeholders Are Important ==
*Shareholders/owners are the most important stakeholders as they control the business. If they are unhappy than they can sack its directors or managers, or even sell the business to someone else.
*No business can ignore its customers. If it can't sell its products, it won't make a profit and will go bankrupt.
*If a business doesn't keep its employees happy, it may become unproductive. It won't work to its full potential and so its profits may suffer.
*A business may not mind being unpopular in the local community if it sells its products to a wider area.

Although lakes and rivers are visible sources of water, did you know that there is water present underground at almost every spot on Earth? Though this may be surprising, water beneath the ground is commonplace. It bubbles to the surface at times through springs and geysers. We also use wells to bring underground water to the surface, so that we can use this important resource in places where fresh surface water is not readily available.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Define groundwater.
* Explain the location, use, and importance of aquifers.
* Define springs and geysers.
* Describe how wells work, and why they are important.

==Groundwater==
As you have learned, most of the Earth's water is found in the oceans, with smaller amounts in frozen ice caps, and still smaller amounts present in lakes and rivers. Some water is found in the atmosphere in the form of water vapor or clouds. However the most common place to find fresh liquid water is under the Earth's surface, in a form called '''groundwater''' (Figure 13.20). Water from the surface seeps downward into the ground through tiny spaces or pores in the rock. At some point, though, it hits a layer of rock that no longer has pores, which stops the water from traveling downward. This rock is called '''impermeable''' because the water can no longer pass through it. The upper surface of the groundwater is called the '''water table'''. The water table will fall when there has been little rain in an area for a long time. The water table will also rise when it rains steadily for a long time. It is important to know how deep beneath the surface the water table is for anyone who intends to dig into the surface or make a well. Because groundwater involves interaction between the Earth and the water, the study of groundwater is called '''hydrogeology'''.

[[File:Groundwater.png|450px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.20''': Groundwater is found beneath the solid surface. Notice that the water table roughly mirrors the slope of the land's surface. A well penetrates the water table.]]

==Aquifers==
Large collections of groundwater can be found in '''aquifers''' (Figure 13.21). Aquifers are large regions of sediment or rock that can hold significant amounts of groundwater. Aquifers can be large, sustainable water resources when water pumped out of aquifers is replenished by the water cycle. However, some aquifers are overused; people pump out more water than can be replaced. As the water is pumped out, the water table slowly falls, requiring people to spend more energy pumping out the water from greater depths. In addition, some wells may go completely dry if they are not deep enough to reach into the lowered water table. Draining aquifers can lead to the ground sinking, sometimes under houses and other structures. And when coastal aquifers are overused, salt water from the ocean may enter the aquifer, contaminating the aquifer and making it less useful for drinking and irrigation.

[[File:TravellingSprinkler.JPG|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.21''': Agricultural irrigation often depends on water from aquifers.]]

Most land areas have some kind of aquifer beneath them. Aquifers can occur at different depths and different geographic locations. The closer aquifers are to the surface, the more likely they will be used by humans. However, closeness to the surface also increases the probability that the aquifers could be contaminated by surface pollution that seeps through the porous rock along with the water. Aquifers are usually not open spaces like caverns or swimming pools, but instead are porous rock and sediment. The spaces between the sediments or rock particles are filled in with water. Wet sand at the beach is a good model for the consistency of most aquifers.

The Ogallala Aquifer is one of the world's largest aquifers, and is a particularly important source of freshwater in the United States. It lies beneath eight United States states — South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. It ranges from less than a meter deep to hundreds of meters deep and covers about 440,000 square kilometers! It is widely used by people for municipal and agricultural needs. However, its rate of replenishment is only about 10% of the rate at which it is being used. In other words, for every 100 liters of water that people withdraw from the aquifer, only 10 liters are being naturally replaced by precipitation. This overuse of the aquifer has created political controversies and disputes in those areas that depend on the aquifer.

==Springs and Geysers==
Whenever water beneath the ground meets the surface, a '''spring''' is created (Figure 13.22). This is a natural point where groundwater emerges on the Earth's surface. When water from a spring flows downhill, it can create a stream. If it does not move downhill, it may be termed a '''seep''', and may create a pond or lake. Depending upon the source of water, the spring may be either constant, or may only flow at certain times of year.

|}

Some minerals may become dissolved in groundwater, changing the water's flavor. Even carbon dioxide can dissolve in the groundwater, causing the water to be naturally carbonated. This water is sometimes sold as &quot;mineral water&quot;.

Groundwater can be heated by magma below the Earth's surface. The heated water can create '''hot springs''', springs with water that is naturally hot (Figure 13.23). Some hot springs are used as natural hot tubs and are considered therapeutic and spiritual by some people. However, hot springs can be dangerous, too. Their temperatures can be exceedingly hot, dissolved substances can be poisonous, and organisms like viruses and bacteria can spread disease. Be sure a hot spring is safe before entering one.

[[File:Old Faithfull-pdPhoto.jpg|200px|thumb|'''Figure 13.24''': Old Faithful Geyser during an eruption.]]

When heated groundwater is trapped in narrow spaces, the pressure builds up and causes water to actually rocket upward. A geyser is the result of such a pressurized spring. Most geysers do not erupt constantly, but rather in periodic spurts, because pressure decreases during an eruption and then increases again after an eruption. Old Faithful, probably the most famous geyser in the world, got its name for erupting in regular cycles lasting 90 minutes (Figure 13.24). Its eruptions last for a couple of minutes and discharge 15,000 to 30,000 liters of water during each eruption.

==Wells==
A well is an artificial structure created by digging or drilling in order to reach groundwater present below the water table. In Figure 13.25, you can see how a well penetrates the groundwater. When the water table is close to the surface, wells can be a very convenient method for extracting water. You may have made a very simple well by digging a hole in the sand at the beach until you see a pool of water at the bottom. When the water table is far below the surface, digging wells can be quite a challenge. Most wells use motorized pumps to bring water to the surface, but many wells still require people to use a bucket to draw water up.

[[File:Traditional Well-Kerala.JPG|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 13.25''': An old-fashioned well that uses a bucket drawn up by hand.]]

Wells have been an important source of water for humans through the ages. Obviously, in places that have little precipitation, wells are vital to life. Using groundwater at a faster rate than it can be replenished by the water cycle, will cause the water table in an aquifer to fall. A well using that groundwater might therefore go dry, as the water that supplies the well gets used up. It is important to use water at a rate at which it can be naturally replenished. In addition, humans must be careful not to pollute groundwater, since pollution can make water supplies unusable by humans.

==Lesson Summary==
* Groundwater, water that infiltrates the ground, forms our largest source of readily available freshwater.
* The water table forms the top of the zone of saturation, where pore spaces in sediment or rock are completely filled with water.
* Aquifers are underground areas of sediment or rock that hold groundwater.
* In steep areas, where groundwater intersects the ground surface, a spring or seep can form.
* If groundwater is heated by magma, it can form hot springs and geysers.
* In order to access groundwater supplies, humans drill wells and pump water from the ground.

==Review Questions==
# What is groundwater?
# What is the water table?
# What are aquifers and why are they so important?
# Replenishing an aquifer is important because it makes the aquifer a resource that can last a long time. What do you think are ways to keep the amount of water used and the amount of water replenished the same?
# Earthquakes can often change the frequency of eruptions or the amount of water released by geysers. Why do you think this is so?
# Why can hot springs be dangerous?
# How does a well work?
# Groundwater is invisible to people on the surface of the Earth. Explain one way that you might monitor how humans are affecting the amount of groundwater in an aquifer.

Have you ever heard the Earth called the &quot;Blue Planet&quot;? This term makes sense, because over 70% of the surface of the Earth is covered with water. The vast majority of that water (97.2%) is in the oceans. Without all that water, our world would be a different place. The oceans are an important part of Earth: they help to determine the make-up of the air, they help determine the weather and temperature, and they support great amounts of life. The composition of ocean water is unique to its location and depth. Just as Earth's interior is divided into layers, the ocean separated into different layers, called the water column.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Describe how the oceans formed.
* Explain the significance of the oceans.
* Describe the composition of ocean water.
* Define the parts of the water column and oceanic divisions.

==How the Oceans Formed==
Scientists have developed a number of hypotheses about how the oceans formed. Though these hypotheses have changed over time, one idea now has the wide support of Earth scientists, called the volcanic outgassing theory. This means that water vapor given off by volcanoes erupting over millions or billions of years, cooled and condensed to form Earth's oceans.

===Creation and Collection of Water===
When the Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago, it would never have been called the Blue Planet. There were no oceans, there was no oxygen in the atmosphere, and no life. But there were violent collisions, explosions, and eruptions. In fact, the Earth in its earliest stage was molten. This allowed elements to separate into layers within the Earth — gravity pulled denser elements toward the Earth's center, while less dense materials accumulated near the surface. This process of separation created the layers of the Earth as we know them.

As temperatures cooled, the surface solidified and an atmosphere was created. Volcanic eruptions released water vapor from the Earth's crust, while more water came from asteroids and comets that collided with the Earth (Figure 14.1). About 4 billion years ago, temperatures cooled enough for oceans to begin forming.

[[File:Volcano q.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 14.1''': Volcanic activity was common in Earth's early stages, when the oceans had not yet begun to form.]]

===Present Ocean Formation===
As you know, the continents were not always in the same shape or position as they are today. Because of tectonic plate movements, land masses have moved about the Earth since they were created. About 250 million years ago, all of the continents were arranged in one huge mass of land called Pangea (Figure 14.2). This meant that most of Earth's water was collected in a huge ocean called Panthalassa. By about 180 million years ago, Pangea had begun to break apart because of continental drift. This then separated the Panthalassa Ocean into separate but connected oceans that are the ocean basins we see today on Earth.

[[File:Pangea continents and oceans.svg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 14.2''': Pangea was the sole landform 250 million years ago, leaving a huge ocean called Panthalassa, along with a few smaller oceans.]]

==Significance of the Oceans==
The Earth's oceans play an important role in maintaining the world as we know it. Indeed, the ocean is largely responsible for keeping the temperatures on Earth fairly steady. It may get pretty cold where you live in the wintertime. Some places on Earth get as cold as -70°C. Some places get as hot as 55°C. This is a range of 125°C. But compare that to the surface temperature on Mercury: it ranges from -180°C to 430°C, a range of 610°C. Mercury has neither an atmosphere nor an ocean to buffer temperature changes so it gets both extremely hot and very cold.

[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|250px|thumb|'''Figure 14.3''': Coral reefs are amongst the most densely inhabited and diverse areas on the globe.]]
On Earth, the oceans absorb heat energy from the Sun. Then the ocean currents move the energy from areas of hot water to areas of cold water, and vice versa. Not only does ocean circulation keep the water temperature moderate, but it also affects the temperature of the air. If you examine land temperatures on the Earth, you will notice that the more extreme temperatures occur in the middle of continents, whereas temperatures near the water tend to be more moderate. This is because water retains heat longer than land. Summer temperatures will therefore not be as hot, and winter temperatures won't be as cold, because the water takes a long time to heat up or cool down. If we didn’t have the oceans, the temperature range would be much greater, and humans could not live in those harsh conditions.

The ocean is home to an enormous amount of life. This includes many kinds of microscopic life, plants and algae, invertebrates like sea stars and jellyfish, fish, reptiles, and marine mammals. The many different creatures of the ocean form a vast and complicated food web, that actually makes up the majority of all biomass on Earth. ('''Biomass''' is the total weight of living organisms in a particular area.) We depend on the ocean as a source of food and even the oxygen created by marine plants. Scientists are still discovering new creatures and features of the oceans, as well as learning more about marine ecosystems (Figure 14.3).

Finally, the ocean provides the starting point for the Earth's water cycle. Most of the water that evaporates into the atmosphere initially comes from the ocean. This water, in turn, falls on land in the form of precipitation. It creates snow and ice, streams and ponds, without which people would have little fresh water. A world without oceans would be a world without you and me.

==Composition of Ocean Water==
Water has oftentimes been referred to as the &quot;universal solvent&quot;, because many things can dissolve in water (Figure 14.4). Many things like salts, sugars, acids, bases, and other organic molecules can be dissolved in water. Pollution of ocean water is a major problem in some areas because many toxic substances easily mix with water.

[[File:Composition of ocean water.svg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 14.4''': Ocean water is composed of many substances. The salts include sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, and calcium chloride.]]

Perhaps the most important substance dissolved in the ocean is salt. Everyone knows that ocean water tastes salty. That salt comes from mineral deposits that find their way to the ocean through the water cycle. Salts comprise about 3.5% of the mass of ocean water. Depending on specific location, the salt content or '''salinity''' can vary. Where ocean water mixes with fresh water, like at the mouth of a river, the salinity will be lower. But where there is lots of evaporation and little circulation of water, salinity can be much higher. The Dead Sea, for example, has 30% salinity&amp;mdash;nearly nine times the average salinity of ocean water. It is called the Dead Sea because so few organisms can live in its super salty water.

The density (mass per volume) of seawater is greater than that of fresh water because it has so many dissolved substances in it. When water is more dense, it sinks down to the bottom. Surface waters are usually lower in density and less saline. Temperature affects density too. Warm water is less dense and colder waters are more dense. These differences in density create movement of water or deep ocean '''currents''' that transport water from the surface to greater depths.

==The Water Column==
In 1960, one of the deepest parts of the ocean (10,910 meters) was reached by two men in a specially designed submarine called the Trieste (Figure 14.5). This part of the ocean has been named the Challenger Deep. In contrast, the average depth of the ocean is 3,790 meters&amp;mdash;still an incredible depth for sea creatures to live at and for humans to travel. What makes it so hard to live at the bottom of the ocean? There are three major factors&amp;mdash;the absence of light, low temperature, and extremely high pressure. In order to better understand regions of the ocean, the scientists define different regions by depth (Figure 14.6).

[[File:Bathyscaphe Trieste.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 14.5''': The Trieste made a record dive to the Challenger Deep in 1960.  James Cameron repeated this feat in 2012.]]

[[File:Oceanic divisions.svg|600px|center|thumb|'''Figure 14.6''': The ocean environment is divided into many regions based on factors like availability of light and nutrients. Organisms adapt to the conditions and resources in the regions in which they live.]]

Sunlight only penetrates water to a depth of about 200 meters, a region called the '''photic zone''' (photic means light). Since organisms that photosynthesize depend on sunlight, they can only live in the top 200 meters of water. Such photosynthetic organisms supply almost all the energy and nutrients to the rest of the marine food web. Animals that live deeper than 200 meters mostly feed on whatever drops down from the photic zone.

Beneath the photic zone is the '''aphotic zone''', where there is not enough light for photosynthesis. The aphotic zone makes up the majority of the ocean but a minority of its life forms. Descending to the ocean floor, the water temperature decreases while pressure increases tremendously. Each region is progressively deeper and colder, with the very deepest areas in ocean trenches.

The ocean can also be divided by horizontal distance from the shore. Nearest to the shore lies the '''intertidal zone'''. In this region, you might find waves, changes in tide, and constant motion in the water that exposes the water to large amounts of air. Organisms that live in this zone are adapted to withstand waves and exposure to air in low tides, by having strong attachments and hard shells. The '''neritic zone''' includes the intertidal zone and the part of the ocean floor that very gradually slopes downward, the continental shelf. Lots of oceanic plants live in this zone, since some sunlight still penetrates to the bottom of the ocean floor in the neritic zone. Beyond the neritic zone is the '''oceanic zone''', where the sloping sea floor takes a much even steeper dive and sunlight does not reach. Animals such as sharks, fish, and whales can be found in this zone. They feed on materials that sink from upper levels, or consume one another. At hydrothermal vents, areas of extremely hot water with lots of dissolved materials allow rare and unusual producers to thrive.

==Lesson Summary==
* Our oceans originally formed as a water vapor released by volcanic outgassing cooled and condensed.
* The oceans serve the very important role of helping to moderate Earth’s temperatures.
* The oceans are home to a tremendous diversity of life, and algae which are all photosynthetic organisms.
* The main elements dissolved in seawater are chlorine, sodium, magnesium, sulfate and calcium.
* Usual salinity for the oceans is about 3.5% or 35 parts per thousand.
* Some regions in areas of high evaporation, like the Dead Sea, have exceptionally high salinities.
* The photic zone is the surface layer of the oceans, down to about 200m, where there is enough available light for photosynthesis.
* Below the photic zone, the vast majority of the oceans lies within the aphotic zone, where there is not enough light for photosynthesis.
* On average, the ocean floor is about 3,790m but there are ocean trenches as deep as 10,910m.
* The ocean has many biological zones determined by availability of different abiotic factors.
* Neritic zones are nearshore areas, including the intertidal zone. Oceanic zones are offshore regions of the ocean.

==Review Questions==
# What was the name of the single continent that separated to form today's continents?
# From what three sources did water originate on Earth?
# What percent of the Earth's surface is covered by water?
# How do the oceans help to moderate Earth's temperatures?
# Over time, the Earth's oceans have become more and more salty. Why?
# What is the most common substance that is dissolved in ocean water?
# What is density?
# Compare and contrast the photic and aphotic zones.
# Describe the types of organisms found in the intertidal, neritic, and oceanic zones. Give examples of a life form you think might be found in each.

; Pangea
: The supercontinent that tectonically broke apart about 200 million years ago, forming the continents and oceans that we see today on Earth.
; photic zone

With &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; applied first the result is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{v} \mathrm{d}\Psi = \mu_{11} H_1 \mathrm{d} H_1&lt;/math&gt;. Integration gives &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{v} \Psi = \frac{1}{2} \mu_{11} H_1^2&lt;/math&gt;. Applying the addition field of strength &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; produces additional work &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{v} \mathrm{d}\Psi = \mu_{12} H_1 \mathrm{d} H_2 + \mu_{22} H_2 \mathrm{d} H_2&lt;/math&gt; and integration gives us &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{v} \Psi = \mu_{12} H_1 H_2 + \frac{1}{2} \mu_{22} H_2^2&lt;/math&gt;. The work done is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \mu_{11} H_1^2 + \mu_{12} H_1 H_2 + \frac{1}{2} \mu_{22} H_2^2&lt;/math&gt;.

With &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; applied first the result changes. First we get &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{v} \mathrm{d}\Psi = \mu_{22} H_2 \mathrm{d} H_2&lt;/math&gt; and after integration &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{v} \Psi = \frac{1}{2} \mu_{22} H_2^2&lt;/math&gt;. Applying &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; results in &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{v} \mathrm{d}\Psi = \mu_{11} H_1 \mathrm{d} H_1 + \mu_{21} H_2 \mathrm{d} H_1&lt;/math&gt;. The work done is thus &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \mu_{11} H_1^2 + \mu_{21} H_2 H_1 + \frac{1}{2} \mu_{22} H_2^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Both calculations are only equal if &lt;math&gt;\mu_{12} = \mu_{21}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic phonemes of Korean language can be largely classified into 19 consonants, 6 vowels and 2 semivowels, forming syllables by the syllable formation rule. After syllables are formed, phonemes of the syllables are changed to appropriate ones by the essential phonological rules and other optional rules. Although there are regulations on standard Korean pronunciation, most Koreans are not conscious of the standard pronunciation except those who are required to speak with standard pronunciation, such as announcer. This is something that the readers should be concerned about when speaking Korean, which requires them to acquire both the idealistic standard pronunciation and the realistic common pronunciation.

== Phonemes ==
=== Consonants ===
Consonants of Korean is roughly classified as voiceless and voiced; and the voice is grouped as ''basic''(예사소리, unmarked), ''asprated''(거센소리, adding ʰ, but we'll write as &quot;h&quot; simply) and ''tense''(된소리 adding ˈ or doubbling the letter) once more. The voicless makes a pair as &quot;basic-asprated-tense&quot; except the only pair of sound &quot; s - s' &quot;(basic-tense). Following is the pairs of voicless:

* p - ph - p'
* t- th - t'
* s - s'
* tɕ - tɕh - tɕ'
* k - kh - k'

The asprated sound is almost similar with voicless in English when it is first sound in word, such as; /ph/ in '''p'''en, /th/ in '''t'''ea, /kh/ in '''c'''ar. /tɕh/ is simmilar with [tʃ] of '''ch'''air, but it is shallower and sharper, pronounced between two places of articulation in English, [j] and [tʃ]. English [s] in '''s'''ea is not similar with Korean /s/, but /s'/. The tense sound is similar with voicless foregone by [s] in English, such as; /p'/ in s'''p'''onge, /t'/ in s'''t'''one, /k'/ in s'''ch'''ool, /tɕ'/ in ques'''ti'''on.

The basic sound is most difficult because this sound tends not to be found out in other languages as well as English. You can refer to pronunciation of some initial voiceless consonants of Japanese to undertand it: /k/ in '''k'''usa ('''く'''さ), /t/ in '''t'''ama ('''た'''ま) /s/ in '''s'''ake('''せ'''け) (basic sound /s/ is founded in all arrangement unless followed by a doubling sound mark small tsu (っ) such as ja'''ss'''hi (ざ'''っし'''), which is rather similar to the tense sound /s'/), but the basic sound /p/ is not founded even in Japanese while the tense sound /p'/ is always findable in every arragement of Japanese /p/.

/s/ and /s'/ is patalized into alveolo-palatal sound [ɕ] and [ɕ'], which is pronounced in the same place as that of /tɕ/, when preceding /i/ or /j/-connected diphthongs such as /si/ changed into [ɕi] (because most of Koreans cannot recognize the difference between [si] and [ɕi], the branches used in this example to represent the sound pronounced in real speech are the phonetic branches [ ], not the phoneme branches / /).

In category of voiced are 3 nasals and a mere liquid. Here is the following table of consonants, formed from the places and the manners. Read it carefully and remember.

[[File:Illyrians.jpg|thumb|250 px|Illyrian tribes in antiquity]]

'''Illyria''' was a region in the western part of today's Balkan Peninsula inhabited by the '''''Illyrians''''', a heterogeneous coalition of tribes. Very little is known about the Illyrians, though a number of them are assumed to have been united by a common Illyrian language. 

'''''Illyrians''''' were divided in tribes such as Albani, Dassareti, Enchelei, Dalmatae, Deraemestae, Taulantii, Pannonian tribes, Pirustae, Molossians, Thesprotians, Chaonians etc. 

Illyrian border lies from rivers Drava and Sava in the north and Ambracian Gulf in the South.

==What did their buildings look like?==
[[File:Apollonia odeon.jpg|thumb|Theater of Apollonia.]]
Illyrian architecture was almost the same as Greek and Roman architecture. Thanks to its position Illyria was greatly influenced by those two countries. Illyrian buildings had regular shape and the main materials that were used were limestone and marble or gold for decorations. Some famous buildings that still remain are those in the site of '''Apollonia''' ''(in the photo)'' and '''Butrinti''', the amphitheatre in '''Durrës''' etc.

==What did they eat?==
Illyrian used to eat meat, bread, honey, milk and drink a kind of beer (which is still known as '''''The Beer of Peja'''''), brandy and wine. Brandy is still used in Albania and other parts of Balkan Peninsula as a kind of '''''&quot;national drink&quot;'''''

==What did they wear?==

==What did their writing look like?==

==What did they believe?==

==What is their history?==

==Are some of them famous even today?==

Yes of course, haven't you heard about Roman emperors for example Decius, Hostilian, Claudius Gothicus, Aurelian, Probus and so on and so on? They were from Illyria. Pyrrhus of Epirus was a Molossian from Illyria. Olympias, the mother of Alexander the Great was from Illyria too. Want you more? OK, Bardyllis, Monunius, Queen Teuta, Gentius, Bato, Celer were famous Illyrians too.

==What is left of them today?==
The whole modern '''Albania''', '''Kosovo''' and other parts inhabited by Albanians in Balkan such as Western Macedonia, Northwestern Greece, Southeast Montenegro etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:ChildAdultSun.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Chumash rock art]]
The Chumash are Native American people who historically inhabit chiefly central and southern coastal regions of California, in portions of what is now San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties, extending from Morro Bay in the north to Malibu in the south. They also occupied three of the Channel Islands: Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel; the smaller island of Anacapa was uninhabited. Modern place names with Chumash origins include Malibu and Simi Valley.

==History==
===Before Spanish Contact===
Archaeological research demonstrates that the Chumash have deep roots in the Santa Barbara Channel area and lived along the southern California Coast for millennia. The Chumash people thrived at a very early period in California prehistory, with some settlements dating to at least 10,000 years before present. Sites of the Millingstone Horizon date from 7000 cal BC to 4500 cal BC; they evidence a subsistence system focused on the processing of seeds with metates and manos. During that time people used bipointed bone objects and line to catch fish and began making beads from shells of the marine olive snail.

===Spanish Arrival===

Chumash people first encountered Europeans in the autumn of 1542, when two sailing vessels under Juan Cabrillo arrived on the coast from Mexico. Cabrillo died and was buried on San Miguel Island, but his men brought back a diary that contained the names and population counts for many Chumash villages, such as Mikiw. Spain claimed what is now California from that time forward, but did not return to settle until 1769, when the first Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived with the double-purpose of Christianizing the Native Americans and facilitating Spanish colonization. By the end of 1770 missions and military presidios had been founded at San Diego to the south of Chumash lands and Monterey, to their north.

The Chumash people moved from their villages to the Franciscan missions between 1772 and 1817. Mission San Luis Obispo, established in 1772, was the first mission in Chumash-speaking lands, as well as the northernmost of the five missions ever constructed in those lands. Next established, in 1782, was Mission San Buenaventura on the Pacific Coast near the mouth of the Santa Clara River. Mission Santa Barbara, also on the coast, and facing out to the Channel Islands, was established in 1786. Mission La Purisima Concepcion was founded along the inland route from Santa Barbara north to San Luis Obispo in 1789. The final Franciscan mission to be constructed in native Chumash territory was Santa Ynez, founded in 1804 on the Santa Ynez River with a seed population of Chumash people from Missions La Purisima and Santa Barbara. To the southeast, Mission San Fernando, founded in 1798 in the land of Takic Shoshonean speakers, also took in large numbers of Chumash speakers from the middle Santa Clara River valley. While most of the Chumash people joined one mission or another between 1772 and 1806, a significant portion of the native inhabitants of the Channel Islands did not move to the mainland missions until 1816.

==Culture==
The Chumash people depended on the ocean for their way of life.  They caught crabs and dug clams for food.  They also hunted otters for their skins which they traded to other tribes for other commodities.

Chumash villages were of different sizes, some having as many as a thousand people.  The large villages would choose a chief.  A group of smaller villages might choose one chief to serve them. The position of chief was often hereditary.  If a chief had no sons, a daughter might serve as the next leader.

The Chumash had a valuable natural resource that other Californian cultures did not have.  In some areas, tar seeped up from the ground.  They used the tar to seal the insides of baskets to make them waterproof.  They also used tar to seal the cracks between the boards of large wood canoes. 

The Chumash were some of the best boat builders in California.  Their canoes were called ''tomols''. The canoes were built from redwood planks bound together with milkweed string.  The seams between planks were sealed with tar.  Each canoe had at least one double-bladed redwood paddle.  The canoes were often decorated with colorful paintings that reflected tribal legends.  They sometimes paddled to the California Channel Islands about 30 miles away from the coast to trade.

why thankee you :) - one day I probably will provide feedback on these lovely big welcomes, because unfortunately, whilst I feel warm and fuzzies from getting one, I never really read it, or follow any links (sorry!) - and I have a mini suspicion that newer folk might just feel a bit overwhelmed - a bit like buying a new gadget and getting a manual that's 4 inches think ;-) [[User:Privatemusings|Privatemusings]] ([[User talk:Privatemusings|talk]]) 10:00, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

== External links ==

Hi, please don't add external links to books unless you have a really good reason. I don't think there's a real guideline which states which external links can be added, but common practice shows that the way we do it is very similar to Wikipedia's, at least in my opinion.

:no worries - I wasn't sure what was best. The 'really good reason' would be that the resource, although subject to copyright, is actually the best out there, in particular for the early genesis of wikipedia - it gets a bit controversy focused in later periods. I'll think about re-doing some of the early stuff when I get some more time. cheers, [[User:Privatemusings|Privatemusings]] ([[User talk:Privatemusings|talk]]) 01:48, 16 August 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Parasha Tzav (Give an Order)
: Vayikra/Leviticus 6:1-8:36; Jer. 7:21-8:3, 9:22-23; Mal'achi/Malachi 3:4-24; Messianic Jews/Hebrews 8:1-6.


Tzav or &quot;Command&quot; continues to deal with many types of animal sacrifices and the duties that the priests were to perform concerning them.  Tzav details the guilt offering, the priests' role in the offerings, and the admonition to keep the fire on the altar burning.  It ends telling us about the consecration of Aaron and his sons.

Sacrifices and their importance are something that we may question in regard to the importance of studying other than for historical purposes.   Is Yeshua not our final sacrifice?  

But if we are to appreciate the final sacrifice of Messiah at Calvary, we must know about  what our ancestors had to sacrifice previously for their sin, which gave a foreshadowing of His sacrifice that would cover all sin.  As we learn about the sacrifices and the priestly tasks that the Ancient Israelites had to experience, we can appreciate the fact that today we can presently go right to Yeshua and apply His sacrifice for our sin, and we do not have to sacrifice animals.


&lt;u&gt;The Service of the High Priest&lt;/u&gt;

In Leviticus 6:13-23 there is instruction for the priests for their daily grain offering which is called, the Minchah.

It is noteworthy that the High Priest (Kohen Gadol) was obligated to bring a grain offering each day.  Despite his exalted status, the only sacrifice that he was duty-bound to bring was not animals, but of humble grain.  Furthermore, in the same way that the community brought a twice-daily burnt offering (Tamid), the High Priest (Kohen Gadol) himself offered a twice-daily offering of grain.  

Before he can serve as the “messenger” of the people of Israel, the priest (Kohen) must first purify himself through the atonement of this Minchah.  Also, it is significant that the Torah draws a comparison between the daily Minchah of the Kohen Gadol and the initiation Minchah of every other Kohen (priest):  Each day, the High Priest (Kohen Gadol) must dedicate himself anew, as if it were the day of his first consecration.

Here is what the High Priest (Kohen Gadol) would do each day:  First, he would take an tenth of an ephah of whole flour that belonged to him and, using the measurements of the Sanctuary, divide it into two, preparing one part for the morning and one part for the afternoon.  Then he would mix the flour with three logs (a liquid measure) of oil, because the Torah commanded with oil, meaning extra oil.  The mixture was then scalded in boiling water and the High Priest (Kohen Gadol) would knead six loaves out of each half.  This means that, each day, he would offer a total of twelve loaves, corresponding to the twelve tribes of Israel, which he must represent.

Afterwards, the Kohen Gadol would bake each loaf partially, and then fry it in a pan using his own oil, but again not cooking it too much.  Then he would divide each loaf into two, so he could offer half in the morning and half in the afternoon.  Each half was bent and then broken into pieces.  The six halves were burnt completely on the altar, together with a handful of frankincense, in the morning, at the community’s burnt-offering; the other six loaves were similarly offered with the community’s afternoon burnt offering, which closed the day’s sacrificial order.

The Minchah is usually the offering of the poor.  The High Priest is elevated above all of Israel, but he must remember his lowliness before the Master of the Universe and come before Yahweh as one of low status bringing his own offering.   He is to offer a Minchah from his own goods everyday and to burn it in its entirety, to show that his own standing before Yahweh is on his own merits and not upon his position or the service he performs to the people.


&lt;u&gt;The Law of the Burnt Offering  (6:8-13)&lt;/u&gt;

The fire for the burnt offering on the Altar of Sacrifice was to never go out, it was a permanent fire.  The priest was to stoke up the fire each morning after it had died down during the night.  This speak of the need to have the fire of our devotions to Him always burning, ready for any sacrifice we may required to make for Him.   
In the morning he was to attend to it, clean out the ashes and restoke it.    If the relieving priest came in the morning and found that the fire had gone out, he would go and find the sleeping priest and set his clothes alight.  He then would have to tear off the burning garments and run naked to get new clothes.    

This is the allegory in Revelation 16:15  &quot;Behold I am coming as a thief.  Blessed is he that watches and keeps his garments. lest he walk naked and they see his shame.&quot;    If we do not stay awake spiritually alert and keep our flame of devotion alight, we shall be caught and exposed without our robes of righteousness to cover us.
In the morning before we start the day is the time to deal with any 'ashes' that remain in our lives so as to start the day with a 'clean slate' and renewed devotion.   The term &quot;morning devotions&quot; has been used to designate the need for this time of prayer before we begin our day's service. 

&quot;Then he shall take off his garments and put on other garments,  and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.&quot;  This short excerpt from Tzav tells us how the ashes from the burnt offerings were to be removed and disposed of.  Concerning this, the ArtScroll Chumash states &quot;The Kohen scoops up a shovelful from the innermost ashes on the Altar and places it on the floor of the Courtyard, east of the ramp that leads to the top of the altar&quot;.  v.11

As the priests were to remove a shovelful of ash to symbolize a daily national declaration of serving Him, we as living sacrifices before God (Romans 12:1) must make daily declaration to serve Him.  Can Yeshua as our Priest interceding at the Temple in Heaven take a daily scoop of  the &quot;ashes&quot; from our ever-burning self-sacrifice symbolizing that we are indeed &quot;on fire&quot; for Yahweh and are continually being purified, ready for the Master's assignments?	    

We, as priests, are admonished to be as living sacrifices before Yahweh.  We must be burning continually before Him as peace offerings delighting in His Presence.  May Yeshua as our Priest in Heaven be able to place the &quot;ashes&quot; of our sacrifice in the Heavenly Temple, indicating that we are on fire for Him.


&lt;u&gt;The Peace Offering&lt;/u&gt;

Concerning the peace offering, Yahweh commands &quot;The fire on the Altar shall be kept burning on it, it shall not be extinguished&quot; (vs 6:5[12], ATS).  The peace offerings, or shelemim  were to be a continual reminder of the covenant that God had made with Israel and were to be a pleasing fragrance unto  Him.

The peace offerings continually offered before Yahweh required a  fire that was kept burning.  The initial flame in the temple had come from above, it only required the wood to be added each day.  Wood is the result of the life and death of a tree.  The Torah is a tree of life (Proverbs 3:18) and Yeshua is the living Torah.  This teaches us that the flammable material that keeps the flame alive in our hearts is the Torah and the Messiah. The life and death of the Messiah has created enough fuel for us to burn for eternity in the presence of the Eternal.  Every morning more fuel must be added to the fire in our heart so that we can burn constantly before the Yahweh.  It is a daily activity to add more fuel to the fire by fellowship with Him and reading His Word.


&lt;u&gt;The Law of Peace Offerings  7:11-21&lt;/u&gt;

The Rabbis teach that every Israelite should be a human temple.  If he is set-apart (kadosh), then his temple is holy (kadosh); if he sins he contaminates it.  This is consistent with the teachings of the Apostles.   Furthermore, in this parashah we see the high priest donning a &quot;fitted&quot; linen tunic and breaches &quot;on his flesh&quot; an illusion to robes of righteousness (6:3).  Most of us have too casual a view of sin: something a righteous and holy God hates and calls an abomination (Psalms 5:5; Prov. 6:16-19).  Sin will damn us eternally (Ezekiel 18:4,20).  Sin sentenced Yeshua to a hideous death on the cross in our place.   Perhaps the greatest area of sin is with our mouths; it defiles our temple probably every day! ( Read Mark 7:14-23 and James 3:1-12)   

It sows discord among brethren, speaks vanities, murders and lies  -  things which Yahweh hates and calls an abomination in Proverbs 6:16-19.  The tongue is a world of iniquity, especially behind closed doors where we let down our guard with our family and loved ones.  There our tongues rip, slice, slash, murder, speak vanities and hypocrisy against others almost without measure.   The word Babylon comes from the Hebrew word bavel meaning confusion or mixture referring to when the languages of men were confounded at the Tower of Bavel.  How can we be a righteous and set-apart priesthood offering up praise and worship to our Creator with our lips, when our lips murder our brother?  This is confusion arising out of a divided heart.  
A forked (serpent's) tongue! 

Scripture plainly tells us to come out of Babylonish ways (Rev. 18:4).  The writer of Hebrews says, Follow peace (shalom) with all men, and holiness, without which no man can see Yahweh&quot;  (Hebrews 12:14).  If we could but tame the tongue, then we would be able to steer our temple into the glorious harbors of holiness and relationship with man and with our Creator.  (James Ch. 3)

The peace offering must be offered in a state of spiritual purity.  This relates to both the meat and the eater.  If either is impure (including impure thoughts on the part of the person making the offering) the offering is disqualified, and the person may even be liable to punishment (or being &quot;cut off&quot; from the camp of Israel).  This teach us that religious activity is only as meaningful and effective as the condition of the individual's heart doing the service. 

What did Yeshua teach about those who would leave their gift at the altar, but whose hearts were impure due to offence they had with their brother?  Did the Father accept such a gift? (See Matt. 5:23-24) 

Yahweh says in Hosea 6:6 says, &quot; For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings&quot; and in 1 Corinthians 13,  Paul states that all religious activities, head knowledge and spiritual gifts are meaningless and valueless in the eyes of the Father if not accompanied by a heart of love.   Do we keep His commandments out of duty and legalism or out of love and faith?  When you offer up your religious service to Yahweh  (i.e., praise and worship, prayer, reading and studying the Word, good deeds to others, etc.) do you have impure thoughts of bitterness, anger, or resentment against your neighbor?  If so, repent and allow Yahweh's love to cleanse your heart so that you can offer up a pure, undefiled and acceptable sacrifice to Him.

7:28-34  -   The peace offering was the only offering where the owner participated in the actual ceremony.  In the ceremony both the owner of the animal and the priest took part in this offering with the priest placing his hands under those of the owner who lifted and waved the meat in all four directions of the compass and then lifted and lowered the meat.  The purpose of this, according to the rabbis, is to teach us that Yahweh controls existence everywhere (in all four directions, and in heaven and below the earth). This is to teach us that we are to be contented with our lot in life and that all is under the Creator's care and control.  What was the Apostle Paul's attitude in life?  Philippians 4:11-13 and 19 says:   Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can do all things through Messiah which strengthens me...But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Messiah Yeshua.

We learn from this that we should not give way to coveting, greed, lust, materialism, striving, anguish and discontent regarding our lot in life.   Rather we should thank Yahweh for what we have, for the rich blessings which by His grace He has bestowed upon us,  and place any cares and desires upon Him and let him bring them to fulfillment. 	(See Psalms 37:4-7, 23-25)

It is interesting to note that the parts of the animal waved during the peace offering were the breast (housing the heart) and the right thigh (which is the leg representing power and strength).  These body parts speak of heart and action.  Good intentions without corresponding action is not really acceptable to the Father.  Neither is mechanical and legalistic obedience if it does not come from the heart.   Yeshua said to the woman at the well in John 4,  that the Father is seeking those who will worship him both in spirit and in truth (verses 23-24)


&lt;u&gt;Being Set Apart and Consecrated&lt;/u&gt;

As the laws of the offerings are given we see the following mentioned: fine flour, olive oil and frankincense (6:8); scalding in boiling water, unleavened bread (6:9), repeatedly baked and broken into pieces (6:14); consecration of and anointing oil on the priests (6:15; 8:1ff); contamination and koshering (6:20; 7:19); innards and feet of the sacrificed animal washed in water (8:21); fire offering (7:25) and mikveh or ritual immersion (8:6).  This all speaking about holiness before Yahweh.  How set-apart or holy (kadosh)is your life? 
The significance of the priests having a drop of blood from the sacrificed ram placed on the right ear, thumb of the right hand and great toe of the right foot ( 8:23),  was to consecrate Aaron and his sons to service in the Tabernacle and symbolise that all we listen to, everything we do and everywhere we go must come under His divine authority and be sanctioned for His purposes. 

In 1 Corinthians 6:12,  Paul says that &quot;all things are lawful&quot; but not all things are beneficial, referring here to the things in life which we engage in.   Having been washed and sanctified by the Spirit (6:11) we are not to allow our 'members' (our bodily parts) to become joined to or involved in that which is not in unity with His purposes for our lives.

The Greek word translated &quot;lawful &quot; here is exesti, &quot;referring to moral possibility,&quot; referring to things that exist which are morally correct and the Greek word translated as &quot;profitable&quot; is sumphero, speaking of that which is &quot;advantageous, to contribute or bring together for the benefit of another.&quot;   In other words even things which are not morally wrong, if they are not advantageous for our spiritual growth,  we should not engage in them.
The rabbis teach that in the world to come after Messiah's coming after the establishment of his eternal kingdom a perfect world will exist without sin therefore eliminating the need for the atonement offering.   7:11-17  Nonetheless, the Thanksgiving Offering will continue as a means to thank Him and to offer praise to Him.

We should develop an attitude of gratitude toward Yahweh and spend time in prayer in thankfulness, praise and gratitude for His goodness and mercy toward us.  We are commanded to give thanks to Yahweh for all things (Ephesians 5:20; 1 Thessalonians 5:18; Colossians 3:17).   We need to discipline ourself to be grateful to Yahweh for all things both the good and the bad that happens, knowing that if we submit to Him, all things will work together for our good.  If we walk with Him in a situation we can find His blessing in it, and have His joy in our heart and mind in all circumstances.   To do so is to let your light shine in such a way as to confound the natural mind of man and to cause those around you to wonder at your source of inner strength, joy, love and light.  To do so adds health to our bodies and years to our life.


﻿&lt;u&gt;The Superiority of Obedience to Sacrifice&lt;/u&gt;

For centuries, the Israelites attempted to follow these commands with varying degrees of zeal and accuracy.  As the Ark of the Covenant, the mercy seat and altars migrated through the wilderness, the period of the Judges, on to Shiloh to ultimately rest on Mt. Moriah on the Temple Mount chosen by the Most High to place His Name (Deuteronomy 12:11; 1 Kings 8:29; Ezra 6:12; Nehemiah 1:9; et. al.), a magnificent Temple under the direction of King Solomon was constructed.  Thereafter, the children of Israel had a more permanent place to bring their respective offerings.  But apparently, by the time of the prophet Jeremiah, the intentions of the offerings had digressed to various perversions that were rampant among the sons of Israel.  Their worship declined so badly that they had come down to to idolatry, theft, murder, adultery and even child sacrifice.  Jeremiah even prophecies that the Temple will end up like Shiloh and that Judah will be scattered just like the seed of Ephraim many years earlier.   From the revelation he was receiving and the voice that he was hearing, he knew that the judgment of God was coming, in just a matter of time, to his contemporaries from Judah.  In a like manner, as we study the Scriptures understanding the ways of our Father while coming to know Him more fully, as we learn to listen to His voice, we also know that judgment is coming to the modern world, because His righteousness requires it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''&lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt;''' keyword tells the compiler that a variable is declared in another source module (outside of the current scope). The linker then finds this actual declaration and sets up the '''&lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt;''' variable to point to the correct location. Variables described by '''&lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt;''' statements will not have any space allocated for them, as they should be properly defined elsewhere. If a variable is declared extern, and the linker finds no actual declaration of it, it will throw an &quot;Unresolved external symbol&quot; error.

Examples:
;&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;extern int i;&lt;/source&gt;: declares that there is a variable named &lt;tt&gt;i of type int&lt;/tt&gt;, defined somewhere in the program.

;&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;extern int j = 0;&lt;/source&gt;: defines a variable &lt;tt&gt;j&lt;/tt&gt; with external linkage; the '''&lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt;''' keyword is redundant here.

;&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;extern void f();&lt;/source&gt;: declares that there is a function &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; taking no arguments and with no return value defined somewhere in the program; '''&lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt;''' is redundant, but sometimes considered good style.

;&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;extern void f() {;}&lt;/source&gt;: defines the function &lt;tt&gt;f()&lt;/tt&gt; declared above; again, the '''&lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt;''' keyword is technically redundant here as external linkage is default.

;&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;extern const int k = 1;&lt;/source&gt;: defines a constant &lt;tt&gt;int k&lt;/tt&gt; with value &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; and external linkage; &lt;tt&gt;extern&lt;/tt&gt; is required because &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; variables have internal linkage by default.

'''&lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt;''' statements are frequently used to allow data to span the scope of multiple files.

When applied to function declarations, the additional &quot;C&quot; or &quot;C++&quot; string literal will change name mangling when compiling under the opposite language.  That is, &lt;code&gt;extern &quot;C&quot; int plain_c_func(int param);&lt;/code&gt; allows C++ code to execute a C library function plain_c_func.

The figure called out to me. It was Blok. We walked together. . . . I said, ‘How do you like it?’ ‘It’s good,’ said Blok, and then added: ‘They burned down my library.'&quot;'' (Vladimir Mayakovsky, 1921.)

= In the past we had libraries =
[[Image:Man sitting at MLK Jr. Memorial Library.jpg|thumb|500px|]]
The following is an opinion piece written by Leigh Blackall (2010).

In the past, we had libraries. They were impressive places. They housed all manner of books, audio, slides, video, and archive materials and collections. Anyone could walk into a library and enjoy largely unrestricted access to any of the collection – for free, so long as they respected the house rules of seriousness, quietness and respect for the items. Some universities would even extend that type of access to empty seats in their lecture theatres. It was a social good – or a way of sustaining a level of society.

eLearning spawned from the Internet about the same time as the dot com investment boom started to take hold. University managers found themselves caught up in the dot com rhetoric, and at the conferences they frequented people started talking about ways to leverage this boom. Everywhere people started to think money could be made from information and content, and everywhere people started to invest in the developments of systems that would restrict access to portions of the Internet. The term Intellectual Property started to become popular in universities! It was a dark time indeed.

The Internet started to split. On one side was the open, distributed, and networked (The Web) area. On the other side was the closed, centralised, and delivered (Darknet) area. Universities went along the Darknet route, on the hunt for more money with the dream of thousands more students, all paying to study, at their own [in]convenience and expense.

Many software developers directed their attention to projects around Content Management Systems (CMS) – largely to serve an inflated dot com market. Developers inside universities modified the CMS to make Learning Management Systems (LMS). The universities accessed and spent millions of dollars of public money, developing content for their new LMS systems. They used this money to create the equivalent of whole new text books, activities, student handbooks, and fancy new media. But instead of housing these shiny new resources in their open access libraries, they housed them in their Learning Management Systems, which were designed to restrict access. Access was restricted to those who would pay. To access these wonderful new collections, people would have to be enrolled students – society as a whole would have to miss out. Libraries said nothing because they knew nothing.

The libraries by and large, never saw much of the money that was poured into eLearning. It was swallowed up by new and powerful IT departments.  How these departments could be seen as anything but the core responsibility of a library is just another strange thing in this story. As a result of this passing over, libraries are what they are today – broken and disconnected, struggling to find relevance. They had a few sporadic attempts to scan and digitise the older collections, but they never really had access to the same amounts of money that was made available for eLearning in the education sector. Digitising library collections was seen as too expensive, especially if the libraries were going to continue to allow anyone to walk in and browse or borrow.

MIT's Open Courseware was a first step in a return to the traditional social values and responsibilities of the university. It was a first step with a clear head, and now with a few more steps – largely around getting copyright and formats right, we might imagine a university very relevant to its global society. Not universities that design technology for restricting access to information and learning, but universities that leverage existing technology to give greater access for many more, at very little extra cost (relative to eLearning), and evidently no loss.

The dot com era has passed, the managers are slowly learning about their mistakes, and a new motivation is taking hold. One of social sustainability through unrestricted access to information and learning. But there’s a new threat on the horizon already. Cloud computing where the centralisation of information could lead to restrictions once again. Cloud computing could be a great thing, used to further that social brief, but we’ll need to keep reminding ourselves of how easy it is to lose our way.

In the next section, is an example of some of the issues surrounding decisions about whether it was best to set up a library of images in a restricted access organisational database, or on an open and existing web-based database, e.g., Wikimedia Commons.

= Otago Polytechnic’s image database project =

Otago Polytechnic's School of Art worked on a project to create an image database. Ideally, that project needed to eventually scale to other departments as well. Apart from the technicalities of meta data, resources such as storage, and sustainability such as who maintained and backed it up – copyright was a problem. The Art School had thousands of slides they wanted to scan and make available to their staff and students digitally, and questions arose on the effects a closed or open database would have on the copyrights of third party images.

One solution proposed was to not create the image data base, but to use an already existing database such as Wikimedia Commons. At first glance, up to half of the images the School might need to use were already available on Wikimedia Commons under various free licenses, and the [[mw:InstantCommons|InstantCommons project]] looks set to make those resources easily available. Interestingly, it seems that Wikipedia is accepting copyrighted works under USA legislation of Fair Use – which could help make such works easier to use educationally than if the images were stored locally at Otago Polytechnic, affected by NZ copyright legislation.

'''Case studies:'''

Based on a statement included with [[w:File:Still_1957_D1.jpg|a copyrighted image on Wikipedia]], it is felt that if the copy is low enough in resolution to not warrant a faithfully replicable copy, or if a copy that could not effectively reproduce in original scale and in detail, or a copy that could not be used commercially to any great degree, it is potentially okay to exist on a Wikimedia project based on the USA fair use legislation.

Also of interest is the [[w:Bridgeman_Art_Library_v._Corel_Corp.|Bridgeman vs Corel case]]. In this case, a US court was in favour of a corporation that made copies of a museum’s images of Public Domain works. The Museum claimed that they had put a lot of work into their scans to ensure accuracy, but that claim worked against them because their scans therefore lacked originality, and so they couldn’t claim copyright. How would this play out in New Zealand or Australia? Does it need to play out in New Zealand if the image is hosted on Wikimedia Commons? Could this extend to copyrighted images?

Stewart Cheifet at archive.org, in a conversation with Leigh Blackall in 2007, put it down to this: low resolution, not making money, all reasonable steps, and no worries = fair use.

Otago Polytechnic would perhaps worry more if they had their own database to maintain, but perhaps Wikimedia Commons is based in San Franscisco, answerable to US law, and demonstratively a fair use case. Wikimedia Commons accepts contributions from anyone in the world, and would probably even celebrate a large database contribution from Otago Polytechnic.

So, what of the Otago Polytechnic database project? They should consider this proposal more seriously, and work towards the bigger projects like Wikimedia Commons, helping to improve that particular open and very usable database that is much larger than anything Otago Polytechnic could do on its own. They can load high resolution images to the Commons for works they have copyrights for, and they are likely to find that a large percentage of the images they need are already there! As for images that they don’t have clearance on, it seems that being an educational institution they can claim fair use under US law if they load low resolution versions to US servers, partnered with US projects like Wikimedia Commons.

Wikimedia Commons uses a MediaWiki platform which has an excellent range of metadata fields not to mention a proven ability to maintain itself through collaborative editing. Otago Polytechnic's use of Wikimedia Commons would dramatically reduce the costs of installing, running and maintaining their own system. But does this stack up?

Of course they would still need to set up a basic internal system for original scans etc.. Like a library back up in case they lose access to Wikimedia Commons. To do this they should use a MediaWiki internally, so the database remains compatible with the Commons, and so the database can be mirrored locally. Ideally, flexibility in whatever database is primarily used is advisable. They might want to use Archive.org in the future if the archive manages to get a good image database search engine up and running. However, the openness of the Commons gives them flexibility in the meantime.

So in this instance, it seems to make more sense to work in with existing projects rather than “reinvent the wheel” as the saying goes. However, although the concept of collaboration and sharing, with regard to the development of resources, has changed considerably in New Zealand since the e-learning Collaborative Development Funded (eCDF) projects in education between 2004 and 2007, there is more work to be done to progress the OER concept on a national or international scale.

Today I want to talk about categorization, and I want to convince you that a lot of what we think we know about categorization is wrong. In particular, I want to convince you that many of the ways we're attempting to apply categorization to the electronic world are actually a bad fit, because we've adopted habits of mind that are left over from earlier strategies.

Think here of how to socialize and personalize services; how to adapt to collection and service use which spans personal, institutional, and cloud environments; how to position and promote the library ‘brand’ as services become atomized and less ‘visible’ on the network; and more complex questions about what best to do locally and what to source with collaborative arrangements or third parties.

In a recent editorial of n+1 magazine the authors posit Webism as a social movement, as significant as feminism, perhaps even socialism ([http://nplusonemag.com/internet-as-social-movement The Internet as Social Movement], The Editors, 2010). Their's is an historical and political overview of the way the Internet has changed the way information is created and presented, such as the manner in which the traditional printed book has been subverted. Their argument is that people mistakenly think of the Internet, and all the technology that goes with it, as simply tools, when they are more accurately an evolving social phenomenon. Regarding the book's displacement by the Internet, they say, ''&quot;At this point the best thing the web and the book could do for one another would be to admit their essential difference. This would allow the web to develop as it wishes ....&quot;'' ([http://nplusonemag.com/internet-as-social-movement The Internet as Social Movement], The Editors, 2010).

These pages are intended to stimulate critical thought and discussion about Information and Communication Technology, and whether it is enabling a social movement. Perhaps we could start this discussion with a consideration of what literacy means today, and how the choices we make in tools, and policies we use to govern practice with those tools, affect those have on the development of that literacy.

'''How it affects teaching practices and networked learning futures - a proposal for action research.'''

The following is a critique prepared by Leigh Blackall and originally published in [http://knowledgetree.flexiblelearning.net.au/edition07/html/editorial.html The Knowledge Tree] in 2005. In this critique the author considers how digital literacy affects teaching practices in Australian education. For example, understandings of digital literacy, the impact of open source software and the place of content within the worldwide rapid publishing and networked learning revolution (Web 2.0). Participatory action research is suggested as an approach to developing awareness of new models for online learning, improving digital literacy skills and enabling networked learning practices in the education sector.

The tone and direction of this critique is determined by consideration of:

* the tension between an understanding of literacy based on print traditions, and an emerging understanding of literacy based on Information, Communication Technology (ICT), or digital literacy,;
* migration to free and open source software and courseware within the Australian education sector and the subsequent impact that may have on levels of digital literacy, including access and equity;
* the influence that the 'content is king' period (1998 - 2004) has had on the collective thinking about online teaching and learning in Australia, and the impact it is having on networked learning possibilities;
* the broader picture of the Internet and the World Wide Web, specifically concepts of Web 2.0 and the influence it may have on online teaching and learning practices;
* a proposal to initiate action research projects to investigate digital literacy and networked learning futures in Australian education.


== What is digital literacy? ==
It is commonly held that having an ability to read and write impacts considerably on a person's potential to communicate and learn. But how, and in what ways does a person's ability to read and write digitally, impact on that potential? Being able to access the Internet; find, manage and edit digital information; join in communications; and otherwise engage with an online information and communications network, are arguably aspects of what could be called 'digital literacy'.

At present Australia measures literacy (consistent with International practice) based on &quot;... how well people use material printed in English. Progression along this continuum was characterised by increased ability to 'process' information (for example to locate, integrate, match and generate information) and to draw correct inferences based on the information being used&quot; (Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), 1997: para. 13).

Recent publications, looking at technological impacts on education, suggest that there are important forms of communicative literacies that go beyond text and print. For example:

:''Many students are entering their school or college with multiple literacies that go beyond text, and this trend will strengthen over the coming years. Educators will need to acknowledge and recognise these new literacies, and build upon and extend them'' (Australian Capital Territory Department of Education and Training (ACT DET), 2005: para. 12)

:''21st century literacy is the set of abilities and skills where aural, visual and digital literacy overlap. These include the ability to understand the power of images and sounds, to recognize and use that power, to manipulate and transform digital media, to distribute them pervasively, and to easily adapt them to new forms.'' (The New Media Consortium, 2005: para. 2)

There is an emerging belief here, that a person's ability to ''process'' digital information is an important factor in the consideration of literacy. What then is the new scope for measuring literacy if we accept that information and communication technologies are affecting people's ability &quot;... to locate, integrate, match and generate information&quot; (ABS, 1997: para. 13).

A definition of digital information literacy has emerged from recent research into the capability of participants in tertiary education in New Zealand (See Hegarty, Penman, Kelly, Jeffrey, Coburn, &amp; McDonald, 2010).


===A Definition of Digital Information Literacy===

Digital Information Literacy (DIL) is the ability to recognise the need for, to access, and to evaluate electronic information. The digitally literate can confidently use, manage, create, quote and share sources of digital information in an effective way. The way in which information is used, created and distributed demonstrates an understanding and acknowledgement of the cultural, ethical, economic, legal and social aspects of information. The digitally literate demonstrate openness, the ability to problem solve, to critically reflect, technical capability and a willingness to collaborate and keep up to date prompted by the changing contexts in which they use information. 


== Issues affecting digital literacy in Australasian education ==
Digital technologies and networked communications are still very much in development. Past, present and future changes in protocols, standards, operating systems and software platforms, not to mention market, infrastructure and policy directions, have, and will inevitably, change - radically impacting people's motivation to sustain effective digital literacy.

The following are four major issues affecting the development of digital literacy in Australian education.

=== The adoption of Free and Open Source (desktop application) software in Australasian education ===
While the use of proprietary desktop software is still very prevalent in Australian and New Zealand educational organisations, there has been a notable shift by government organisations around the world to acknowledge the financial savings and Information Communications Technology capacity building benefits that free and open source software (FOSS) offers. The United Nations Education, Social and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has been documenting this shift around the world, including the eagerly awaited report from the British Educational Communications and Technology Agency (BECTA) which found that schools using FOSS spent between 20-60 percent less on ICTs than non-FOSS-using schools (BECTA, 2005)

Australia has produced its share of publications looking at the use of FOSS in the education sector with earlier work stating that &quot;... the use of open source software across Australian schools and sectors tends to be idiosyncratic and piecemeal rather than coordinated&quot; (Moyle, 2003: para. 30).

Since then there has been an increase in the use of FOSS in Australian and New Zealand education.

The Northern Territory Department of Employment, Education and Training has adopted Linux and other FOSS, and there have been numerous incidents elsewhere in Australia of a migration to FOSS server applications, such as the course management system Moodle (as used by the Education Network Australia). In the case of the Northern Territory's adoption of Linux and other FOSS applications, the following figures were reported to the Open Source Industry Australia. The decision to use Linux and OSS saved the Northern Territory Department of Employment, Education and Training $1M in the first year, and allowed it to put 1000 more workstations into schools (OSIA, 2004).

Regarding FOSS uptake in Australia/NZ schools, Moyle (2004) in a later paper states:

:''Schools around Australia and New Zealand are experimenting with and deploying open source software in a range of different ways. Although there are no formal measures available, it seems from anecdotal evidence that this use is growing'' (Moyle, 2004: para. 14).

In New Zealand recently, Warrington Primary School adopted and self managed FOSS across its school and community computers in 2008. However, the NZ Ministry of Education rejected the schools requests to retain the financial savings for other school expenses (Hedquist, 2008).

Financial savings and long term IT capacity improvement - through the use of FOSS, open standards and more versatile desktop applications - has been shown to be considerable at an organisational and departmental level (BECTA, 2005). But what of the benefits to individual staff, students and subsequently the communities they serve? Case studies of educational organisations in other countries that have attempted to migrate from proprietary to FOSS desktops have strongly indicated that there are substantial challenges - mostly to do with staff and older students being ''accustomed'' to the proprietary desktop setup, supported by community tolerance for pirated software (van Reijswoud &amp; Mulo, 2004).

If educational organisations developed procedures that are more supportive for using free software, then an individual's option to use free software would become a more viable consideration, as their choice to do so would not mean compromising interoperability with the school or college system. Opening such an opportunity, within a supportive educational environment, translates into an investment in access, equity and digital literacy oriented educational practice. This of course begins to address another issue - the pirating of software by staff and students within the organisation who are trying to remain compatible to the organisation's choices in software (van Reijswoud &amp; Mulo, 2004). With appropriate levels of encouragement and support from the organisation, the long term benefits of free software at an organisation and departmental level could be foreseeable, through the gradual development of skills and digital literacy amongst its staff and students.

While the shift in thinking around the world towards the use of free software is notable, and the benefits to education are measurable, sadly, it has been difficult to access information on strategic approaches to FOSS in the various State and Federal Departments of Australian and New Zealand education. Very few examples were found of policy-enabled support for training and professional development within the schools and colleges on the use of free software. Given this apparent lack of Departmental support or direct financial incentive for schools and colleges to use free software, teacher training and professional development programs within educational organisations are likely to continue their ICT training strategies based on proprietary desktop software, and perpetuating the limitations of people's ability and willingness to use free software.

Broadening the scope of the organisation's software training and support capacity beyond the current narrow scope of proprietary software, would create opportunities to broaden the digital literacy of staff and students, including their awareness of social and educational issues affected by computing, such as access and equity, and develop opportunities to implement alternatives to commercial and/or pirated software.

=== The 'content is king' era in Australian education ===
As is indicated by the Australian Capital Territory's Department of Education and Training (ACT DET), 2005) recent report on emerging technologies, there is still a big focus at a Departmental level on content centric models of online teaching and learning. While the ACT DET report acknowledges some of the newer models for online learning briefly covered here and otherwise known as networked learning and open education, a great deal of this phenomenal report focuses on what might be termed 'eLearning 1' - the content centralised, closed, learning object model to online learning.

Departments and organisations have invested staggering amounts of money in this model. NSW's TAFE Connect project, Australian Flexible Learning Framework's Toolboxes, and the Le@rning Federation's Online Curriculum are examples of large scale investment in such a model. Much of the content produced has been designed to work within and (theoretically) across a number of Learning Management Systems (LMS), spawning further content related projects such as research into reusable learning objects, digital [copy]rights management, and meta data tagging. In the face of a proliferation of freely accessible content through the social media networks, it begs the question if these investments are of benefit to teachers and learners. In fact it was argued as early as 2001 by Andrew Odlyzko and David Wiley, that the LMS, content centric model is not beneficial to teachers and learners, or an effective strategy for online teaching and learning, and reiterated on by other authors (e.g., Blackall, 2005; Downes, 2005; Hotrum, 2005; Farmer, 2004; Parkins, 2004; Seimens, 2004).

Downes (2005) spoke about an inevitable shift away from closed-content/centralised/managed learning, to a more open/decentralised/individual model, based on trends in open network Internet usage. Downes used the emergence of the Web 2 phenomenon to illustrate this alternative, demonstrating the interoperability of open network services and arguing that it makes very little sense to remain with the content centric and firewall protected model, and that we need to instead embrace more open, distributed and networked learning models (Downes, 2005).

This shift in thinking from a content centralised model to a dispersed networked model is certain to generate tension not only between teachers and their departments, but between teachers and students. The differences and power shifts between the two models are deep, some (Downes, 2004; Seimens, 2004; Illich,1970) would even suggest that we are waiting for a paradigm shift in educational ideology.

The likely shift away from centralised models to decentralised networked models will necessitate a more independent level of digital literacy among teachers and learners. Educational organisations may have to consider more substantial initial investments in broad scoped literacy programs to lift the level of digital literacy, something that could perhaps be paid for by a reduction in content creation and an increase in the use of free software.

=== Web 2.0 and world wide networked learning ===
Never before has it been easier to create and publish digital media to the Internet. Not only is it easier, but it is conceivably free, so long as a person has access to a networked device. No longer does a person need to know complex html coding, ftp, or how to manage servers etc. Thanks to a myriad of free web based services, a person can create, publish and manage their own content without the need to employ experts or use complex software. This revolution in online communications has triggered an explosion of content creation, much of it licensed to Creative Commons (Linksvayer, 2005) – resulting in a vast range of digital content created by popular participation online, freely available for reuse under Creative Commons Licenses, and ever evolving. This change in the nature of information, communication and knowledge has been dubbed Web 2.0 (Boyd, 2005). It signifies a fundamental change in the nature of the Internet, content ownership, and information dissemination.

The visionary creators of the Cluetrain Manifesto recognised this change as early as 1999 when speaking of markets in the broadest possible sense:

:''Networked markets are beginning to self-organize faster than the companies that have traditionally served them. Thanks to the web, markets are becoming better informed, smarter, and more demanding of qualities missing from most business organizations'' ( Locke, Searls, Weinberger, Levine, 1999: para. 1).

Educational organisations (redefining themselves more and more, for better or for worse, as business organisations) are struggling to position themselves in the Web 2.0 era. Arguably their heavy investment in the centralised, proprietary based, content centric model, typified by the LMS, has made it extremely difficult for organisations to make a change, largely because networked learning does not require such an investment.

As Harold Jarche put it when he joined the online discussion between leading educational bloggers on the concept of ’Small Pieces Loosely Joined’ (distributed networked learning), and echoing the concerns of earlier writers (Downes: 2004; Odlyzko, 2001; Wiley, 2001).

:''This is still a difficult message to get past many educational institutions and training organisations. You don't have to spend a lot on the technology. You need to focus on getting the people and processes aligned so that learning happens. Save the money that you would spend on an LCMS and put it into the time to let people develop processes that work for their unique contexts.'' (Jarche, 2005: para. 4)

Many schools and teachers have not yet recognized—much less responded to—the new ways students communicate and access information over the Internet. Students report that there is a substantial disconnect between how they use the Internet for school and how they use the Internet during the school day and under teacher direction. For the most part, students’ educational use of the Internet occurs outside of the school day, outside of the school building, outside the direction of their teachers (Levin, Arafeh, Lenhart &amp; Rainie, 2002: para. 3).

Anya Kamanetz, author of the book DIYU: Edupunks, Eduprenuers, and the Coming Transformation of Higher Education, noted a recent survey of US universities that revealed that on average 82% of faculty ''never'' use social media in their work! Whereas 72% regularly use closed Learning Management Systems (Kamanetz, 2010).

Australian educational Departments and organisations, as do other sectors affected by the changes in media and communications, need to start accepting that there are considerable cultural changes taking place around them that are affecting the fundamental understandings with which they operate. Educational departments and organisations would do well to begin implementing exit strategies from previous content centric models of online learning (Morrison, 2005), and start investing in digital literacy programs and sustained participatory research. The goal should be to set in motion a continuous and sustained development cycle focused on enabling, supporting and encouraging the use of free software, social media, open education and research and networked learning practices.

== A proposal for a participatory action research ==
'''Developing better digital literacy skills and awareness of new models for online learning in Australian education'''

The New Media Consortium (2005) outlined five strategic priorities for creating change to enable &quot;21st Century literacies&quot;:
# Develop a strategic research agenda;
# Raise awareness &amp; visibility of the field;
# Make tools for creating &amp; experiencing new media broadly available;
# Empower teachers with 21st Century literacy Skills;
# Work as a community.
(New Media Consortium, 2005, p. 13)

Participatory action research is likely the most productive research and action methodology with which educational departments and organisations may improve the digital literacy in their communities, while at the same time addressing the broader points outlined by the New Media Consortium. Investment in participatory action research projects would offer incentives to communities (including students, parents and citizens) and educational organisations (including teachers, managers and administrators) to work together towards identifying and continually maintaining their collective digital literacy for networked learning.

Wikipedia has a comprehensive, but more importantly, the most participatory source of information about action research - including a quote by Wadsworth (1998) explaining the methodology.

:''Participatory Action Research (PAR) is research which involves all relevant parties in actively examining together current action (which they experience as problematic) in order to change and improve it. They do this by critically reflecting on the historical, political, cultural, economic, geographic and other contexts which make sense of it. … Participatory action research is not just research which we hope will be followed by action! It is action which is researched, changed and re-researched, within the research process by participants. Nor is it simply an exotic variant of consultation. Instead, it aims to be active co-research, by and for those to be helped. Nor can it be used by one group of people to get another group of people to do what is thought best for them - whether that is to implement a central policy or an organisational or service change. Instead it tries to be a genuinely democratic or non-coercive process whereby those to be helped, determine the purposes and outcomes of their own inquiry.'' (Wikipedia, 2005: para. 2, citing Wadsworth, 1998:para. 33)

At first it may appear that participatory action research approaches differ little from typical professional development initiatives. But there are key aspects that are different.

* The explicit aim to engage all stakeholders, especially students, in describing the problems.
* Asking those stakeholders to research the problem and propose solutions.
* Empowering those stakeholders to carry out their plans.
* Repeating the cycle, reflecting on lessons learned and publishing the research.

Remodeling programs like professional development, networking and researching programs into broader scoped, longer termed, community engaged action research projects, may yield interesting results in the area of digital literacy for education. Suggested seed projects might involve a range of areas:
* An Australian/New Zealand version of Levin et al's research (2002) Digital Disconnect - The widening gap between Internet savvy students and their schools.
* A look at Doug Brent's (2005) notion of Teaching as performance in the electronic classroom.
* Research into the idea of generation and digital literacy, modeled on Konrad Glogowski's (2005) Digital Pioneers.
* A look at self directed learning in Australia and New Zealand and the capacity for institutional recognition.

Essentially the idea of participatory action in education is not new and has been practiced in the form of Parents &amp; Citizens Associations and Boards of Trustees at most schools, student councils and business and industry relations, and in teacher development. This sort of community involvement would transfer easily into participatory action research. This is a proposal to renew and continue such forms of public participation, focused on the development of digital literacies for enabling open education and networked learning.

==Development of capability==
Action research was used to develop the capability of tertiary education staff and students in accessing and managing digital information.  &quot;They used a wide range of tools, most of which they had never tried before, and which few had confidence in using at the beginning of the project&quot; to create &quot;personal online learning environments&quot; (Hegarty et al, 2010, p. 10). Action learning cycles were an important strategy for supporting the dispositions needed in the digital environment, particularly when using Web 2.0 approaches.  A key finding was: &quot; ... the value of having time and permission to ‘play’ within a supportive environment and dynamic learning community&quot; (Hegarty et al, 2010, p. 10). 

The dispositions required to obtain an adequate or minimum level of digital information literacy were found to include:
* confidence and belief in own ability (self-efficacy);
* a demonstration of openness;
* the ability to problem solve and take risks;
* technical capability;
* a willingness to collaborate and share; and
* the desire to keep ‘up to date’ driven by the changing contexts of information use and requirements (Hegarty et al, 2010, p. 20). 

The outcome of the research is that: &quot; ... there is no one size fits all model. Instead users of digital information are more likely to increase their level of skill and capability if supported to work within an environment which they have created for themselves.  ... flexible programmes and strategies were used and they were successful in enabling learners to set their own goals based on personal and professional relevance&quot; (Hegarty et al, 2010, p. 19).

Four main recommendations arose from the research. 

1. Learning programmes intended to develop digital information literacy in tertiary education settings must:
* Have personal relevance for individuals and be integrated into everyday, work and study contexts;
* Allow learners the opportunity to ‘play’ and engage in supported exploration, as well as exposing them to new tools and strategies for organising a digital PLE or presence in a networked environment (Web 2.0);
* Recognise the importance of allocating time for regular face-to-face, (or possibly where appropriate, synchronous online) small group, learning opportunities that provide support for diverse self-directed goals and flexible and collaborative approaches to learning;
* Facilitate participation in dynamic learning communities to encourage sharing and collaboration regarding digital information resources and knowledge;
* Encourage meta-cognitive awareness of the learning process, through reflective practice and peer communication;
* Provide support to allow learners to become comfortable with a digital identity and become familiar with ethical behaviour and etiquette in the digital networked environment; and
* Consider the dimensions of digital information literacy, and foster personal capabilities, conducive to success in an ever changing digital environment, as outlined in the definition of DIL developed for the project. (The actual dispositions and skills required are described fully in the project taxonomies, Chapter Three &amp; Appendix 2). 
   
2. Infrastructure at tertiary education institutions should be continually reviewed, in order to capitalise on the benefits of consistent access for staff and students to the latest web technologies, while recognising the ongoing need for security.
   
3. Educators and information services personnel should continue to engage in discussion and debate with the intention of reviewing and redeveloping a definition of DIL, based on the work done in this project, to underpin future programmes for developing and maintaining the digital information skills and capability of staff and students. 
(Hegarty, Penman, Kelly, Jeffrey, Coburn &amp; McDonald, 2010.)

==Summary==
It is evident that a social revolution is occurring around the use of Information and Communication Technology. Trends in society are infiltrating the educational sector, and teachers and students are increasingly having to respond to the challenges of the digital environment.  It is imperative that all players are supported to develop the necessary capability and dispositions needed for accessing and managing digital information on the Internet, (21st Century literacies) if they are to take part in an open networked and connected society. Participatory action research is mooted as an effective approach for enabling open education and networked learning.

'''Deschooling Society'''

By Ivan Illich (1970).

Universal education through schooling is not feasible. It would be no more feasible if it were attempted by means of alternative institutions built on the style of present schools. Neither new attitudes of teachers toward their pupils nor the proliferation of educational hardware or software (in classroom or bedroom), nor finally the attempt to expand the pedagogue's responsibility until it engulfs his pupils' lifetimes will deliver universal education. The current search for new educational funnels must be reversed into the search for their institutional inverse: educational webs which heighten the opportunity for each one to transform each moment of his living into one of learning, sharing, and caring. We hope to contribute concepts needed by those who conduct such counterfoil research on education--and also to those who seek alternatives to other established service industries.

'''Something to do, not something to learn: Experiential learning via online role play'''

By Mary Aquino (2004).

In response to shifts in scientific and psychological thinking coupled with the inescapable impact of technology on cognition and behaviour many contemporary researcher/practitioners are calling for a comprehensive rethinking of teaching and learning methodologies. Prensky (2001) writes largely from personal observation as a designer, trainer and futurist. His work has a distinctly promotional, unacademic tone and his thesis draws on recent and therefore limited research in psychology and neuroscience. However, the essential intuitive accuracy of his observations and the power of his digital native/digital immigrant metaphor have found a receptive audience amongst many teachers and trainers genuinely looking for ways to engage young learners.

'''Outta My Way Geezer!'''

By Tom Hoffman (2005).

I am thirty six, and I AM A DIGITAL NATIVE. I know you baby boomers have a hard time coping with this concept because it is a threat to your authority, and as a result you seem to be constantly reinventing the concept so that it can't be applied to any actual adults who can compete with you professionally, but I've had it, and I'm calling bullshit.

'''Some of us are Digital Pioneers'''

By Konrad Glogowski (2005).

Lawrence Lessig says that creativity and innovation always builds on the past. This is exactly what we're doing when we introduce our children to the digital world. Our role as educators, to paraphrase Lessig, is to ensure that the past, the linear, visual mode of thinking give rise to but does not limit the creativity and the energy of emerging technologies. This can happen only if we recognize that we cannot impose the old upon the new just as we cannot create the new in a vacuum. It is our job to ensure that our students acquire the skills necessary to intelligently share their views, whether it's in a wiki, an every-day conversation, or a traditional five-paragraph essay. We need to ensure, as Prensky suggests, that they learn both the legacy and future content. To do that, we need to acquire the skills of digital pioneers, we need to remix and feed forward.

'''First Monday Special Issue'''

Various First Monday writers

Research in the Free/Libre/Open Source (FLOSS) arena is inter-disciplinary and varied. At this point, we already have several years of research in this area with many important intellectual contributions (see http://opensource.mit.edu for a list of papers and active scholars). Many of those contributions have appeared in First Monday and hence, this special issue is a celebration of these contributions and their impact on academia and practice.

'''Total cost of ownership and open source software'''

Kathryne Moyle (2004).

As a result of this research then, while information has been gathered that can inform future work undertaken within schools and jurisdictions, it is also apparent that there remains gaps in our knowledge about the extent of use of open source software in schools and the costs associated with its use. Irrespective of any of this however, schools and jurisdictions are choosing to place open source software into their ICT portfolios. Arising from this research then, comes the challenge of how to respond to and manage the emerging use of open source software in schools.

'''Why schools should use exclusively free software'''

by Richard Stallman (2005).

School should teach students ways of life that will benefit society as a whole. They should promote the use of free software just as they promote recycling. If schools teach students free software, then the students will use free software after they graduate. This will help society as a whole escape from being dominated (and gouged) by megacorporations. Those corporations offer free samples to schools for the same reason tobacco companies distribute free cigarettes: to get children addicted (1). They will not give discounts to these students once they grow up and graduate.

'''Sydney Linux User Group posting'''

By SLUG member (2002).

We are a school that is into Linux and OSS at the server level and some applications (web based). The issues you have to deal with I believe are not the execs and top level, but the staff, the front-line teachers as it were. They want to use computing tools but they do not want them to get in their way, they need them to assist the education process not hinder. The vast majority of them are familiar with MS Office apps and Windows in general and see no reason to change and what they use at home they want to use at work - no double learning. Of course cost is NOT an issue the vast majority of the software is pirated [at home] and so is essentially free, a kind of Pirate Public License. So you win no friends by even suggesting that there may be another way, they already know that, but don't care.

'''Use of Linux in Schools in the Northern Territory'''

By Open Source Industry Australia (2004).

The decision to use Linux and OSS saved the Northern Territory Department of Employment, Education and Training $1M in the first year, and allowed it to put 1000 more workstations into schools.

'''Open source software and Australian school education'''

By Kathryn Moyle (2003).

The direct quantitative costs of open source are lower than that of proprietary software. There is debate however, about the qualitative comparative aspects of the indirect costs of open source software when applied within a school environment. No Australian school education research exists that addresses the indirect costs of open source software as they apply to a school environment. In order to gain some common points from which to conduct discussions, research work on this matter would be make a useful contribution to the debate.

'''What Business can learn from open source'''

By Paul Graham (2005:para. 1).

Lately companies have been paying more attention to open source. Ten years ago there seemed a real danger Microsoft would extend its monopoly to servers. It seems safe to say now that open source has prevented that. A recent survey found 52% of companies are replacing Windows servers with Linux servers. [http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html#f1n]
More significant, I think, is which// 52% they are. At this point, anyone proposing to run Windows on servers should be prepared to explain what they know about servers that Google, Yahoo, and Amazon don't.
But the biggest thing business has to learn from open source is not about Linux or Firefox, but about the forces that produced them. Ultimately these will affect a lot more than what software you use.

http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html

'''Open Source Software in Schools - A study of the spectrum of use and related ICT infrastructure costs'''

By BECTA (2005, p. 3).

Proportionally, support costs accounted for about 60% of the total annual cost per PC in both OSS and non-OSS schools. Annual support costs in individual OSS schools varied widely, but on average were 50–60% of those of their non-OSS counterparts, except OSS secondary schools which had slightly higher costs for informal support.
The varying support costs between OSS schools are closely related to the purpose and type of OSS implementation chosen by a school and the purposes for which OSS is being used. The most cost-effective support level and the kind of support required will vary accordingly.

Expenditure on training across all four sets of schools was low. This could partly explain the high support costs; perhaps more or better training could reduce the need for this.

Teachers in the OSS schools view their own skills and confidence in using ICT much more positively than the teachers in the non-OSS schools do, and lower levels of training could therefore be expected.

'''Free and Open Source Software for Development - Myth or Reality? Case study of a University in Uganda'''

By Victor van Reijswoud and Emmanuel Mulo (2004, p. 9).

For the incoming students a compulsory introductory FOSS computer literacy course was introduced based on a manual (available from www.eacoss.org and the university intranet) developed by the university. This greatly reduced the resistance.

'''Emerging Technologies - A framework for thinking'''

By ACT DET (2005).

Positioning the ACT DET to take advantage of emerging technologies will require acknowledgement of the need for cultural change and processes to support and manage it. Students today are ‘native speakers’ of the digital language of computers, video games and the Internet. Many devices described in this report are banned by schools. A shift in culture is crucial to ensure that students’ uses of these devices are embraced as educational opportunities and that they become tools of the trade, rather than be considered contraband.

Many students are entering their school or college with multiple literacies that go beyond text, and this trend will strengthen over the coming years. Educators will need to acknowledge and recognise these new literacies, and build upon and extend them.

The success of such an approach will require that teachers/tutors have access to professional development opportunities to develop confidence in the use of educational technology, as well as informal support environments of peers.

'''Conversational writing kicks formal writing's ass'''

By Kathy Sierra (2005).

If you want people to learn and remember what you write, say it conversationally. This isn't just for short informal blog entries and articles, either. We're talking books. Assuming they're meant for learning, and not reference, books written in a conversational style are more likely to be retained and recalled than a book on the same topics written in a more formal tone. Most of us know this intuitively, but there are some studies to prove it.

'''Early film, early Internet, early days'''

By Leigh Blackall (2005). 

Costly and unsustainable content development comes from the focus on computers and programs in education throughout the 80's and 90's and a lack of focus on the connectivity and collective learning offered by modem mediated communications. It seems to me that the content creation is very much tied to the process of learning, and that the connectivity offered by the Internet challenges everything about our traditional teacher / student / course / content methods. The content is created by learners as they learn, such as this blog post, what I'm typing and the links I am pointing to.

'''Open Technology Roadmap'''

By Jamais Cascio (2005).

Openness is at the heart of truly world changing systems. Transparency of process, connections and results make open systems more reliable, more accessible, and better able to be connected to other systems; it also encourages collaboration and the input of interested stakeholders. This is perhaps most tangible in the world of technology, particularly information and communication technology (ICT); open ICT systems are increasingly engines of innovation, and are clear catalysts for leapfrogging across the developing world, via reduced costs, potential for customization, and likely interoperability with both legacy and emerging technologies.

'''Summarising A Roadmap for ICT EcoSystems'''

By Harold Jarche (2004).

The Problem = 'In the race to identify victims and assist survivors, Thailand’s government hits its own wall. Responding agencies and non-governmental groups are unable to share information vital to the rescue effort. Each uses different data and document formats. Relief is slowed; coordination is complicated. The need for common, open standards for disaster management was never more stark or compelling. The Royal Government of Thailand responded by creating a common website for registering missing persons and making open file formats in particular an immediate national priority.'

The Solution = Open Standards

'''From Andragogy to Heutagogy'''

By Stewart Hase and Chris Kenyon (2000).

Our educational systems have traditionally been based on Lockean assumptions ... In this paradigm learning has to be organised by others who make the appropriate associations and generalisations on behalf of the learner. Thus, random individual experiences are taken to be totally inadequate as sources of knowledge, the educational process needs disciplined students, and literacy is seen to precede knowledge acquisition. Success is based on attending to narrow stimuli presented by a teacher, an ability to remember that which is not understood, and repeated rehearsal (Emery, 1974, p.2).

An alternate view is proposed by Heider and assumes that people can make sense of the world and generalise from their particular perceptions, can conceptualise, and can perceive invariance (Emery, 1974). Thus, people have the potential to learn continuously and in real time by interacting with their environment, they learn through their lifespan, can be lead to ideas rather than be force fed the wisdom of others, and thereby they enhance their creativity, and re-learn how to learn.

'''A Global Imperative: Report of the 21st Century Literacy A Global Imperative'''

By The New Media Consortium (2004).

21st century literacy is the set of abilities and skills where aural, visual and digital literacy overlap. These include the ability to understand the power of images and sounds, to recognize and use that power, to manipulate and transform digital media, to distribute them pervasively, and to easily adapt them to new forms. (p2)

The strategic priorities for creating change (p. 13):
# Develop a Strategic Research Agenda
# Raise Awareness &amp; Visibility of the Field
# Make Tools for Creating &amp; Experiencing New Media Broadly Available
# Empower Teachers with 21st Century Literacy Skills
# Work as a Community

'''Why Web 2.0 Matters: Preparing for Glocalization'''

By Danah Boyd (2005).

Glocalized structures and networks are the backbone of Web2.0. Rather than conceptualizing the world in geographical terms, it is now necessary to use a networked model, to understand the interrelations between people and culture, to think about localizing in terms of social structures not in terms of location. This is bloody tricky because the networks do not have clear boundaries or clusters; the complexity of society just went up an order of magnitude.

'''Small (Learning) Pieces Loosely Joined'''

By Harold Jarche (2006).

This is still a difficult message to get past many educational institutions and training organisations. You don't have to spend a lot on the technology. You need to focus on getting the people and processes aligned so that learning happens. Save the money that you would spend on an LCMS and put it into the time to let people develop processes that work for their unique contexts.

'''Literacy'''

By the Wikipedia community (2009).

For the contemporary world literacy now comes to mean more than just the ability to read, write and be numerate. It involves, at all levels, the ability to use and communicate in a diverse range of technologies. Since the computer became mainstream in the early 1990s, its importance and centrality in communication has become unassailable.

We should now, properly, speak of &quot;literacies&quot;. These literacies always involve technology and the ability to use technology to negotiate the myriad of discourses that face us in the modern world. These literacies concern using information skillfully and appropriately, and are multi-faceted and involve a range of technologies and media.

In sum, today's students need to cope with a complex mix of visual, oral, and interactive media as well as traditional text. People of lesser education or older people may see themselves falling behind as the informational gap between them and the people literate in the new media and technologies widens.

'''Literacy in the Information Age: Final Report of the International Adult Literacy Survey'''

By OECD (2000).

Low literacy skills are evident among all adult groups in significant - albeit varying - proportions. Literacy proficiency varies considerably according to home background factors and educational attainment in most of the countries surveyed. However, the relationship between literacy skills and educational attainment is complex. Many adults have managed to attain high levels of literacy proficiency despite a low level of education; conversely, some have low literacy skills despite a high level of education. These differences matter both economically and socially: literacy affects, inter alia, labour quality and flexibility, employment, training opportunities, income from work and wider participation in civic society. Improving the literacy skills of the population remains a large challenge for policy makers. The results suggest that high-quality foundation learning in schools is important but insufficient as a sole means to that end. Policies directed at the workplace and family settings are also needed. The employers’ role in promoting and rewarding literacy skills is particularly important for skills development.

'''Aspects of Literacy: Assessed Literacy Skills'''

By Australian Bureau of Statistics (2005).

The SAL did not define literacy in terms of a basic threshold, above which someone is 'literate' and below which someone is 'illiterate'. Rather it defined literacy as a continuum for each of the three types of literacy (consistent with international practice, these are also referred to as the prose, document and quantitative scales) denoting how well people used material printed in English. Progression along this continuum was characterised by increased ability to 'process' information (for example to locate, integrate, match and generate information) and to draw correct inferences based on the information being used.

'''Breaking the LMS wall'''

By Michael Hotrum (2005).

“All in all it was just a brick in the wall. All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.” (Pink Floyd, November 30, 1979)
The Internet is independent of device (hardware or platform), distance, and time, and is well-suited for open, flexible, and distributed learning. Yet traditional online, distributed learning methods are anything but flexible, open, or dynamic. What went wrong? Parkin (2004a, b) believes that we failed to appreciate that the Internet is a vehicle for connecting people with each other. We implemented LMS methods that imposed bureaucratic control, diminished learner empowerment, and delivered static information. “In a world hurtling toward distributed internetworking, e-learning was still based on a library-like central-repository concept.” Parkin suggests it is time to explore the true promise of e-learning, and to rework our ideas about how learning should be designed, delivered, and received. It is time to stop letting the LMS vendors tell us how to design learning. It is time to stop the tail from wagging the dog.

'''The Cluetrain Manifesto'''

By Chris Locke, Don Searls and David Weinbergner (1999).

Corporate firewalls have kept smart employees in and smart markets out. It's going to cause real pain to tear those walls down. But the result will be a new kind of conversation. And it will be the most exciting conversation business has ever engaged in.

Networked markets are beginning to self-organize faster than the companies that have traditionally served them. Thanks to the web, markets are becoming better informed, smarter, and more demanding of qualities missing from most business organizations.

'''Teaching as performance in the electronic classroom'''

By Doug Brent (2005).

One of the most useful concepts for understanding modern life is &quot;residual orality.&quot; Ong pointed out that before the printing press stablized the effects of literacy, many aspects of society remained oral. Manuscripts were often read aloud, even by people reading them in private. Oral debates were a major way of producing knowledge. Witnesses were more important than documents. Now the printing press has made residual orality a much smaller part of everyday life. However, in many areas of life, oral performance has been remarkably resistant to being &quot;textualized&quot;: that is, taken over by written or electronic texts. Teaching is one of these areas.

I want only to use this phenomenal persistence of the performative, after 500 years of technologies that could in principle have replaced it with textualization, as a reason to reflect carefully on what now seems to be happening to notions of intellectual property as online technologies promise increasing textualization of teaching.

'''Connectivism: A learning theory for the digital age'''

By George Siemens (2004).

Connectivism is the integration of principles explored by chaos, network, and complexity and self-organization theories. Learning is a process that occurs within nebulous environments of shifting core elements – not entirely under the control of the individual. Learning (defined as actionable knowledge) can reside outside of ourselves (within an organization or a database), is focused on connecting specialized information sets, and the connections that enable us to learn more are more important than our current state of knowing.

Connectivism is driven by the understanding that decisions are based on rapidly altering foundations. New information is continually being acquired. The ability to draw distinctions between important and unimportant information is vital. The ability to recognize when new information alters the landscape based on decisions made yesterday is also critical.

'''Most scientific papers are probably wrong'''

By Kurt Kleiner for New Scientist (2005).

Most published scientific research papers are wrong, according to a new analysis. Assuming that the new paper is itself correct, problems with experimental and statistical methods mean that there is less than a 50% chance that the results of any randomly chosen scientific paper are true.

Comment by George Siemens: What I find interesting is not that the papers themselves are wrong, but that there are very limited opportunities for readers to correct and discuss the paper in its original context. Any format that is &quot;set in stone&quot; isn't going to work today. Blogs are particularly effective at enabling the inclusion of contrary viewpoints. Journals are still one-way, broadcast tools. Perhaps journal publishers should reflect on what's happening to TV, newspapers, and music. Two-way knowledge flow is critical.

'''Free/Open source software in education'''

By Tan Wooi Tong (2004).

FOSS [Free and Open Source Software] can lower the barriers to the access of ICTs by reducing the cost of software. The initial acquisition cost of FOSS is negligible. Indeed, it is usually possible to download FOSS without any cost. If there is limited bandwidth, it may be more convenient to get the software in a CD-ROM for a nominal fee. But there is no licensing fee for each user or computer and it can be freely distributed once a copy is downloaded or made available on a CD-ROM. Hence, the initial cost of acquiring FOSS is much lower than the cost of acquiring proprietary software for which license fees have to be paid for each user or computer. Upgrades of FOSS can usually be obtained in a similar way, making the upgrade costs negligible as well. In contrast, proprietary software upgrades normally have to be paid for even though the upgrade costs may be lower than the initial cost.

'''Using free and open source software to create free and open courseware'''

By Leigh Blackall (2004).

The freedom to acquire and use a range of free and open source software whenever and wherever I need them gives me a great deal of flexibility and increased professional capacity. In particular, I can work nomadically, which is to say, like our students, on many different computers, at home or at work, not restricted to one single computer and operating system, and not limited to the version of software being used.

'''The Buntine Oration: Learning Networks'''

By Stephen Downes (2004). Delivered to the Australian College of Educators and the Australian Council of Educational Leaders conference in Perth, Australia.

While I was thinking of what the educational system could become, the network of publishers and software developers and educational institutions that developed around the concept of learning objects had a very different idea.

Here’s what it would be. Learning resources would be authored by instructors or (more likely) publishing companies, organized using sequencing or learning design, assigned digital rights and licenses, packaged, compressed, encrypted and stored in an institutional repository. They would be searched for, located, and retrieved through something called a federated search system, retrieved, and stored locally in something called a learning content management system. When needed, they would then be unpacked and displayed to the student, a student who, using a learning management system, would follow the directions set out by the learning designer, work his or her way through the material, maybe do a quiz, maybe participate in a course-based online discussion.

That’s the picture. That’s the brave new world of online learning. And honestly, it seems to me that at every point where they could have got it wrong, they did.

'''The Reusability Paradox'''

By The Reusability, Collaboration, and Learning Troupe at Utah State University (2001).

The method learning object proponents have evangelized as facilitating reusability of instructional resources may in fact make them more expensive to use than traditional resources. We have demonstrated that the automated combination of certain types of learning objects can in fact be automated. However, it would appear that the least desirable relationship possible exists between the potential for learning object reuse and the ease with which that reuse can be automated: the more reusable a learning object is, the harder its use is to automate. Identically, the less reusable a learning object is, the easier its use is to automate. This discovery is depressing, indeed.

'''Content is not king'''

By Andrew Odlyzko (2001).

&quot;What would the Internet be without &quot;content?&quot; It would be a valueless collection of silent machines with gray screens. It would be the electronic equivalent of a marine desert - lovely elements, nice colors, no life. It would be nothing&quot;. [Bronfman]

The author of this claim is facing the possible collapse of his business model. Therefore it is natural for him to believe this claim, and to demand (in the rest of the speech [Bronfman]) that the Internet be designed to allow content producers to continue their current mode of operation. However, while one can admire the poetic language of this claim, all the evidence of this paper shows the claim itself is wrong. Content has never been king, it is not king now, and is unlikely to ever be king. The Internet has done quite well without content, and can continue to flourish without it. Content will have a place on the Internet, possibly a substantial place. However, its place will likely be subordinate to that of business and personal communication.

'''The Digital Disconnect: The widening gap between Internet-savvy students and their schools'''

By Doug Levin, Sousan Arafeh, Amanda Lenhart &amp; Lee Rainie (2002).

Many schools and teachers have not yet recognized—much less responded to—the new ways students communicate and access information over the Internet. Students report that there is a substantial disconnect between how they use the Internet for school and how they use the Internet during the school day and under teacher direction. For the most part, students’ educational use of the Internet occurs outside of the school day, outside of the school building, outside the direction of their teachers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Canaliculitis Inflammation of a tear duct (or ducts), caused by a bacterial infection. Symptoms of this disorder include discharge, a red or pink eye and a swollen upper or lower eyelid near the nose.

Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) A common complication of surgery for retinal detachment, which causes scarring of the retina. PVR may require a vitrectomy and intricate surgical removal of scar tissue.(30 November 2008 - Blog article Dr. Boothe )

Bacteria: Single-celled microorganisms which can exist either as independent (free-living) organisms or as parasites (dependent upon another organism for life).

Phakic An eye that still has its natural lens. When an eye is aphakic, usually the lens has been removed during cataract or other eye surgery.

Dacryoadenitis Inflammation of the tear gland, typically caused by a viral or bacterial infection. Symptoms include a dry eye, a red or pink eyelid, swelling of the lid or around the eyes and ptosis.

In most cases, the cause of paralysis of the seventh cranial nerve is unknown (termed &quot;Bell's palsy&quot;). Symptoms include weak facial muscles, difficulty closing the eye, infrequent blinking, earache, acute hearing, facial drooping, ectropion, tearing, eye dryness, blurred vision and a burning feeling in the eye.Boothe Eye Care

Color blindness Partial or total inability to distinguish specific colors. Color blindness is inherited, and is much more common in men than in women.

Drainage angle In glaucoma terminology, &quot;angle&quot; refers to the drainage channel for the aqueous humor in the eye; improper drainage can lead to the high intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma. In narrow-angle glaucoma, the channel is blocked, whereas open-angle glaucoma has other causes, such as the body producing too much aqueous humor. (11 May 2007 Boothe Laser Center )

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''&lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt;''' keyword is used to create an enumerated type named name that consists of the elements in name-list. The var-list argument is optional, and can be used to create instances of the type along with the declaration.

;Syntax:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
    enum name {name-list} var-list;
&lt;/source&gt;

For example, the following code creates the desired data type: 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
enum card_suit {Clubs,Diamonds,Hearts,Spades};
card_suit first_cards_suit=Diamonds;
card_suit second_cards_suit=Hearts;
card_suit third_cards_suit=0; //Would cause an error, 0 is an &quot;integer&quot; not a &quot;card_suit&quot; 
card_suit forth_cards_suit=first_cards_suit; //OK, they both have the same type.
&lt;/source&gt;

The line of code creates a new data type &quot;&lt;code&gt;card_suit&lt;/code&gt;&quot; that may take on only one of four possible values: &quot;&lt;code&gt;Clubs&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;code&gt;Diamonds&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;code&gt;Hearts&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, and &quot;&lt;code&gt;Spades&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. In general the '''&lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt;''' command takes the form:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
enum new_type_name { possible_value_1,
                     possible_value_1,
                     /* ..., */
                     possible_value_n
} Optional_Variable_With_This_Type;
&lt;/source&gt;

While the second line of code creates a new variable with this data type and initializes it to value to &lt;code&gt;Diamonds&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.  The other lines create new variables of this new type and show some initializations that are (and are not) possible. 

Internally enumerated types are stored as integers, that begin with 0 and increment by 1 for each new possible value for the data type.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
enum apples { Fuji, Macintosh, GrannySmith };
enum oranges { Blood, Navel, Persian };
apples pie_filling = Navel; //error can't make an apple pie with oranges.
apples my_fav_apple = Macintosh;
oranges my_fav_orange = Navel; //This has the same internal integer value as my_favorite_apple

//Many compilers will produce an error or warning letting you know your comparing two different quantities.
if(my_fav_apple == my_fav_orange) 
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;You shouldn't compare apples and oranges&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
&lt;/source&gt;

While enumerated types are not integers, they are in some case converted into integers.  For example, when we try to send an enumerated type to standard output.

For example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
enum color {Red, Green, Blue};
color hair=Red;
color eyes=Blue;
color skin=Green;
std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;My hair color is &quot; &lt;&lt; hair &lt;&lt; std::endl;
std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;My eye color is &quot; &lt;&lt; eyes &lt;&lt; std::endl;
std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;My skin color is &quot; &lt;&lt; skin &lt;&lt; std::endl;
if (skin==Green)
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;I am seasick!&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
&lt;/source&gt;

Will produce the output:
&lt;pre&gt;
My hair color is 0
My eye color is 2
My skin color is 1
I am seasick!
&lt;/pre&gt;

We could improve this example by introducing an array that holds the names of our enumerated type such as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
std::string color_names[3]={&quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;};
enum color {Red, Green, Blue};
color hair=Red;
color eyes=Blue;
color skin=Green;
std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;My hair color is &quot; &lt;&lt; color_names[hair] &lt;&lt; std::endl;
std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;My eye color is &quot; &lt;&lt; color_names[eyes] &lt;&lt; std::endl;
std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;My skin color is &quot; &lt;&lt; color_names[skin] &lt;&lt; std::endl;
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case hair is automatically converted to an integer when it is index arrays.  This technique is intimately tied to the fact that the color Red is internally stored as &quot;0&quot;, Green is internally stored as &quot;1&quot;, and Blue is internally stored as &quot;2&quot;. '''Be Careful!''' One may override these default choices for the internal values of the enumerated types.

This is done by simply setting the value in the '''&lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt;''' such as:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
enum color {Red=2, Green=4, Blue=6};
&lt;/source&gt;

In fact it is not necessary to an integer for every value of an enumerated type.  In the case the value, the compiler will simply increase the value of the previous possible value by one.

Consider the following example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
enum colour {Red=2, Green, Blue=6, Orange};
&lt;/source&gt;

Here the internal value of &quot;&lt;code&gt;Red&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is 2, &quot;&lt;code&gt;Green&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is 3, &quot;&lt;code&gt;Blue&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is 6 and &quot;&lt;code&gt;Orange&lt;/code&gt; is 7.
Be careful to keep in mind when using this that the internal values do not need to be unique.  

Enumerated types are also automatically converted into integers in arithmetic expressions.  Which makes it useful to be able to choose particular integers for the internal representations of an enumerated type.
 
One may have enumerated for the width and height of a standard computer screen.  This may allow a program to do meaningful calculations, while still maintaining the benefits of an enumerated type.   
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
enum screen_width {SMALL=800, MEDIUM=1280};
enum screen_height {SMALL=600, MEDIUM=768};
screen_width MyScreenW=SMALL;
screen_height MyScreenH=SMALL;
std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;The number of pixels on my screen is &quot; &lt;&lt; MyScreenW*MyScreenH &lt;&lt; std::endl;
&lt;/source&gt;

It should be noted that the internal values used in an enumerated type are constant, and cannot be changed during the execution of the program.  

It is perhaps useful to notice that while the enumerated types can be converted to integers for the purpose arithmetic, they cannot be iterated through.

For example: 
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
enum month { JANUARY=1, FEBRUARY, MARCH, APRIL, MAY, JUNE, JULY, AUGUST, SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER, NOVEMBER, DECEMBER};

for( month cur_month = JANUARY; cur_month &lt;= DECEMBER; cur_month=cur_month+1)
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; cur_month &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This will fail to compile. The problem is with the {{C++ Programming/kw|for}} loop.  The first two statements in the loop are fine.  We may certainly create a new month variable and initialize it.  We may also compare two months, where they will be compared as integers.  We may '''not''' increment the cur_month variable.  &quot;&lt;code&gt;cur_month+1&lt;/code&gt;&quot; evaluates to an integer which may not be stored into a &quot;&lt;code&gt;month&lt;/code&gt;&quot; data type.

In the code above we might try to fix this by '''replacing''' the {{C++ Programming/kw|for}} loop with:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
for( int monthcount = JANUARY; monthcount &lt;= DECEMBER; monthcount++)
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; monthcount  &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This will work because we can increment the integer &quot;&lt;code&gt;mounthcount&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.

I wonder why nobody has thought of using array modifiers to simplify the creation of the fence. I have added information about this. [[User:Ldo|Ldo]] ([[User talk:Ldo|talk]]) 00:27, 26 November 2010 (UTC)

I can not imagine that this tutorial was without array modifier ^^.[[User:Adam.Elenktik|Adam.Elenktik]] ([[User talk:Adam.Elenktik|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Adam.Elenktik|contribs]]) 20:55, 21 May 2013 (UTC)

==Making the roof and house in one object==
Wouldn't it be simpler to enter edit mode, then enter face select mode, select the top face of the cube and extrude it along the Z axis by 2 units? It'll also make manipulating the house much easier with it as one object. This method is not for people who don't know how to edit things separately from another part of the same object. It is possible to do the above in edit mode and still edit the roof separately, and is explained in previous tutorials. (You just select the parts of the object you wish to edit and edit them.) :--[[User:Mast3rlinkx|Mast3rlinkx]] ([[User talk:Mast3rlinkx|talk]]) 15:33, 11 February 2010 (UTC)

If the roof was made in the same object as the house, then we could not scale the roof a bit wider and let it's edges hang over the house, without all kinds of additional extrusians. [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 00:40, 3 August 2010 (UTC)



==Moving on xy only when making the roof ==
[''User Comment: you can even press'' '''SHIFT+Z''' ''to restrict scaling to X and Y axis without affecting roof height, instead of scaling separately X and Y. SHIFT+Axis also works the same way with grabbing'']

I'm changing the steps to reflect this [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 21:20, 3 August 2010 (UTC)

==Alternate roof Method==
What I did made a more realistic roof, giving the roof a trapezoidal profile. Starting with the basic cube, enter edit mode. Enter face select mode and select the top face, extruding it by 2 units. Enter vertex select mode and choose the top front vertices and merge them at the center. Repeat for the top rear vertices. Enter face select mode and select all the faces below the roof except the base of the house-to-be. Press &quot;X&quot; and choose &quot;Faces.&quot; Enter edge select mode and select all four lower edges of the roof. Press &quot;S&quot; and then &quot;Shift+Z&quot; and scale these edges by 1.2 units. Press &quot;E,&quot; then hit &quot;Esc.&quot; Press &quot;S&quot; again and scale these new edges by 0.8 units. Enter vertex select mode and choose two vertices that are vertically parallel and press &quot;F.&quot; Repeat for the other vertices. Then select four edges that form a vertical square and press &quot;F.&quot; Repeat to make three more walls.&lt;/br&gt;
'''End Mast3rlinkx's method'''

==Picking colors on the mac==
Note: I am no good with colours so I cheated: there is a file rgb.txt in the X Window System which contains about 750 colours represented as R, G, B triples. If you can access this file, you can convert the RGB triple into hexadecimal and enter it into the box called &quot;Hex:&quot; at the top right of the colour selector. I chose &quot;eedd82&quot; LightGoldenrod for the house and &quot;cd5c5c&quot; IndianRed for the roof.{{Clr}}

==Making the fence==

Note:I found it easier to make the upright by subdividing the plane(after it was scaled down) and then moving the middle three verticies near the top. Then i merged the top three verticies and merged them at the center. I found this way much less confusing and easier to do.

It would be much simpler to enter face select mode, then extrude the top face by .07 on the Z axis. Then enter vertex select mode and select the top two vertices of the front face and merge them at the center. Repeat for the back face's top two vertices.
:Also, if you want a more advanced method for building this model (like I did), go to [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Building a House/Advanced Building of the House|Advanced Build of a House]].
::--[[User:Mast3rlinkx|Mast3rlinkx]] ([[User talk:Mast3rlinkx|talk]]) 14:55, 12 February 2010 (UTC)

Note: I made the fence out of a cube, extrude up once and merge the top vertices.
If you just stop where this part of the tutorial ends, then the fence doesn't look right. What I did was enter edit mode for the fence and deleted one of the intersecting palings at each corner, make the remaining corner post a square when viewed from the top, then merged the vertices that make the peak at the center to make a square post with a pyramidal top at each corner. This makes for a much more realistic fence without any advanced methods used.

== it's hard to remember what each of the 4 views is showing==

I can't keep track of what each view is showing, so i was going to change to rewite the tutorial to only use one view at a time, but then I discovered the &quot;view name&quot; setting in the user preferences, which will show us the name of the view that each window is showing! I'll add that into the top section and go thru the tutorial again to make sure I haven't gotten anymore x &amp; y reversed [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 23:10, 3 August 2010 (UTC)

==Be fruitfull and multiply the fence==
You will go bananas doing this.  Better, scale the first pale so that it is big enough, then duplicate it in turn, pressing CTRL to snap the succesive pales to grid (first pale has to be big enough so that grid distance = pale distance).  When you are done you scale the fence down to fit the size of the house.

The text has scaling instructions thanks to an earlier editor :) [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 12:37, 9 August 2010 (UTC)

== Converting this tutorial to Blender 2.5x ==

I am starting redo this tutorial for Blender 2.5x, I have 2.54 now and will change to 2.55 when it is available for Linux/x86_64.

I haven't seen anywhere else in this wikibook any other tutorials being converted.

When I'm finished, I will ask where the tutorial should go -- the only advice I've seen is to put it in Miscellaneous.

[[User:Wynnmc|Wynnmc]] ([[User talk:Wynnmc|talk]]) 20:21, 6 November 2010 (UTC)

== I love the noob note ==

&quot;Noob note-- Make sure that you are in object mode when you duplicate the cube to create your roof. It needs to be its own object so that you can edit it separately from the house object, since you will put one through the other later on (to get the eaves to extend past the walls of the house, without doing extra extrusions)&quot;

How a newb reads it : &quot;Note for idiots&quot;... (Noob is the derogatory word for newb/newbie)... 
haha

== Naming the roof and house objects ==

&quot;To change the name of the house object, go into object mode ( TAB  if not already there), select the original cube, select the Editing panel from the Button window header ( F9  or click on the icon) and, in the panel &quot;Link and Materials&quot;, you will see&quot;

Ok, i think i am in object mode. the box went full solid and glowing orange and i can move it as one thing so i think it is. but there is nothing that happens with F9 and there is no &quot;editing panel&quot; from the button window header that I can see.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A statistic is a single number that represents or helps to describe one aspect of a data set.

By calculating a statistic, you summarise the data and lose detail.  Usually, this means you cannot recreate the original data, even from a collection of statistics.

Examples of statistics include: the mode, median, mean and range (of discrete data), estimated mean, estimated median and modal class of grouped data, interquartile range.  

For IB you also need to know the meaning and method for finding the mean and standard deviation of data sets.  The mean is an example of a statistic that measures location.  The standard deviation is a an example of a statistic that measures dispersal, or spread.  It is common when comparing data sets to comment about both dispersal and location.

:I guess since its been brought up, I'll bite. I think the book should not of been renamed like it was. &quot;Tomato (firmware)&quot; is a Wikipedia convention that isn't used at Wikibooks, and might perhaps even be against policy. The book should be moved back to the &quot;Tomato Firmware&quot; title. The decision to move also appears to be based on discussion that happened at Wikipedia which might also be a problem. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:24, 2 August 2010 (UTC)
::I think even Tomato will work, because we don't have a book about tomatoes. Yet. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 14:34, 2 August 2010 (UTC)
:Could I just chime in - there are a lot of disorganised links to 'Tomato Firmware' on static pages. If we delete the page people will be lost. As it is, the page is quite confusing without the automatic redirect. [[Special:Contributions/121.45.253.46|121.45.253.46]] ([[User talk:121.45.253.46|talk]]) 15:40, 2 August 2010 (UTC)
* The book should be renamed back to '''Tomato&amp;nbsp;Firmware''', per darklama.  The current title is not a book-style title.  IMHO '''Tomato''' is needlessly ambiguous.  The Wikipedia article settled on '''Tomato&amp;nbsp;(firmware)''' in 2006 on the grounds that it was a Wikipedia-style article name, with '''Tomato&amp;nbsp;Firmware''' as the runner-up on the grounds that it was the name used on the project main page.  There was apparently no consensus discussion about renaming the wikibook (not even an out-of-order one at the WP article).
:Re deleting redirects, IIRC it's been suggested that while subpage redirects are generally eliminable (though it's been suggested they be left for a week or more until search engines have caught up with the new arrangement), top-level redirects tend to be kept around indefinitely.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:58, 2 August 2010 (UTC)

:I also don't see a good justification for the rename. The reason stated on the comment &quot;Moving to maintain naming consistency with Wikipedia article, as per discussion on Wikipedia Tomato (firmware) Talkpage.&quot; should have ringed some bells, a discussion at Wikipedia doesn't validate any decision here, and I didn't find any reference to it on the book's talk page.
:I took the chance also to look to the user (that moved the work) contribution history in Wikibooks, the move ought to have been challenged. The problem seems that most contributors to that work are not registered Wikibookians. By these facts and the opinions expressed on this discussion the move should be reverted.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:53, 3 August 2010 (UTC)

Here are some sources of free 3d models from across the web. Take them apart, put them back together, understand what makes them tick, to improve your own modeling.

==Blender-Specific==
These sites offer .blend files for download.
*[http://www.blender-models.com/ The Official Blender Model Repository]
*[http://blender-archi.tuxfamily.org/Models Blender for Architecture]
*http://opengameart.org — more Blender models
*http://katorlegaz.com/3d_models/index.php -- they have furniture, arcade video games, joysticks, toys, vehicles, road and sidewalk items, and simple human models
*[http://yorik.uncreated.net/ Yorik’s site] — some Blender files for his architectural projects are available for download.

===Sites Requiring Registration===
*http://www.blendswap.com/ — specifically for swapping Blender models.

==Non-Blender-Specific==
These sites offer models in other formats.
*http://archive3d.net - 15,000+ free models from archive 3d
This seems to have some licensed models and might be legal trouble see Discussion at http://blenderartists.org/forum/archive/index.php/t-237569.html

*http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/ -  Google's 3d warehouse repository; take the collada version, when available ( the Google Earth downloads are actually .zip files with a collada inside them, so just rename and unzip)
'''Note:''' some of the 3d warehouse models can't be understood by blender due to a zillion repeating elements, others will show up invisible (one sided, or inside out), be gigantic in size, or all parented to some crazy spot out in space. Fixing these to be usable will push your blender skills to new levels in some cases.

'''Tips:''' I’ve tried importing a few of these 3D Warehouse models, and so far I’ve only noticed a couple of issues: 
** The model imports into a new Blender scene, called something like “SketchupScene” or “SketchupScene001”. You may also find additional scenes created with nothing in them, that you can delete. If you try rendering, you may not see anything, because the default camera is only linked into the original default scene named “Scene”. Just select the camera and hit '''CTRL+LKEY''' to link it into the new scene.
** You may notice parts of the model appearing and disappearing as you try viewing it from different angles. This is because it is scaled very large (several hundred Blender Units on a side). Try scaling it down so it’s no more than a few BU on a side.
** There will usually be a lot of doubles, so remove them with '''WKEY'''-&gt;remove doubles.
** There may be many separate objects, so select what you want to combine and hit '''CTRL+J''' to join them all into one object.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This recipe is totally bogus and should be removed. The authentic version contains only four ingredients: 1) pancetta, guanciale, or bacon 2) egg yolks (or whole eggs in some variations), 3) pecorino romano (or parmigiano reggiano as a substitute), and 4) freshly ground black pepper. You may also need a bit of olive oil to brown the pancetta. '''There is no thyme, lemon rind, onion, or creme fraiche. Punto e basta!'''

Furthermore, just because the author read something on an uncited website doesn't make it true. A carbonaro is a coal carrier, or, more likely in this context, a charcoal carrier, not a coal miner, which wouldn't make sense anyway since this dish originated in Rome and there are no coal mines in central Italy. A carbonara would be the carbonaro's wife.

Finally, the correct Italian name for this pasta is &quot;[spaghetti] alla carbonara&quot;, not &quot;[spaghetti] carbonara&quot;, which is pidgin Italian. Unfortunately, this grammatical abomination is also made by many self-proclaimed English-speaking &quot;experts&quot; on Italian food, including famous TV cooking show hosts and cookbook authors, who for some reason think that you can speak Italian by stringing together Italian words with English syntax.

I agree with all the above comment, although maybe not with their tone. I propose the recipe be moved to the North American section. PS why couldn't a carbonaro be a carbonara's husband? ;) [[User:Djkrysa|Djkrysa]] ([[User talk:Djkrysa|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Djkrysa|contribs]]) 16:59, 15 October 2014 (UTC)</text>

;Preface


Project Management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to meet project requirement [PMBOK 1.3] There are books out there that teach about Project Management and the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), and a few others teach how to pass CAPM/PMP. The intent of this book is to bridge the gap between knowledge of Project Management and how to use it in an exam. This book will be neutral in nature and does not cover a particular industry. As you can see from the table of contents, this book consists of several chapters. Exactly one chapter is dedicated to each Project Management Process. This will enable you to view each process as its own entity.
[edit] Audience

This book is intended for those who would like to become a Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) or a Project Management Professional (PMP), and for those who would like to get started in Project Management. If you are already certified, congratulations! This book will help you keep current on the subject. Understanding the content of this book does not require you to be an experienced project manager. It is useful to anyone willing to study the art of project management. A brief introduction at the beginning of each chapter gives an overview of what is to be covered. If you are an experienced project manager, you may encounter concepts with which you are already familiar. Feel free to skip those sections and proceed.

This book covers PMI's Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), Third Edition published in 2004. The Fourth edition came out in December 2008.
[edit] Prerequisite

The citations on this book are from the PMBOK 3.0 published in 2004. So it is advisable to have a copy of PMBOK 3.0 published by PMI.
[edit] Part I: Concepts and Practices
[edit] Introduction

This part gently introduces the Project Management Fundamentals. Chapter 1 deals with the Framework of Project Management building the blocks for essential project management function. Chapter 2 provides an in-depth knowledge of the Project Life Cycle

;Chapter 1 Project Management Framework

After reading this part, the user should be able to - Identify the difference between project and Operational Work. - Understand the characteristics of the project.

Definition of Project: A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result [1.2.1].

Characteristics of the Project:

- Temporary
- Have definite beginning and end
- Create unique product or service
- Have objective that indicate completion
- Progressive Elaboration

Temporary
Temporary in the sense that the project by itself has definite beginning, definite end and is not an ongoing process. Bear in mind, temporary does not apply to the product, service or result itself. Projects are carved to last long.
For instance, construction of road is a project. The project last for a specified period of time. Once the road is laid, the project is said to be complete. The project completion should be measurable. Once this project is completed, the on-going process of maintaining the road which is not a project will put in place. The road lasts longer while the project wraps until complete.

Unique
Product or service produced by the project is different from anything else on the market and involves creating something new to this environment. Unique nature does not mean that no such project exists. Consider construction of a bridge. It is considered as a project, because either the existing bridge is torn down and a new one is constructed or a new bridge is constructed. In the first case, since the outcome is a new bridge and not routine maintenance of the bridge, it becomes project. Even though the technology of bridge construction exists, it becomes unique as they are carried at different locations with different owner, different river.

Purposeful (Objective)
Well defined set of desired end result. One of the requirements of objective is that it is measurable. This quality of the objective will enable to mark the project complete.

Have Life cycle
Progress from an idea, through planning and execution, until they are complete.
Have definite beginning and ending

Have interdependencies
Have defined sequence.

Progressive Elaboration
Developing in steps and continuing by increments. Project entities are described in broad terms at the start of the project but detailed as project progress. Initially this may look failure prone as the details are not detailed, but will eventually

Example:
The activity undertaken to construct a bridge is considered as project as (1) the project ends by the time the construction is complete (2) have time limit as to when the bridge should be finished (3) Not a routine maintenance work (4) Will provide an ability to cross the river.

Difference between project and program

Program is a logical group of related projects. Example:
A marketing department might have a program to launch the company's latest product. Within that program, there might be individual projects for achieving different objectives, such as planning the marketing campaign and launching the product.

[edit] Chapter 6 Project Management Plan

3.2.2.1 (4.3)


[edit] Chapter 7 Scope Planning

3.2.2.2 (5.1)

Have you ever made a trip to the grocery store just to buy a loaf of bread and milk. However when you check out you realize that you were enticed to buy meat, cookies, candy, pies, and every other item that looked tasty in store. It is easy to exceed your original intentions if you do not have a clear objective of what your plan of attack is and how you plan to prevent yourself from diverting from your original path.

The following section discusses scope management which is how to get your work completed – and make sure you only get the correct work completed. We will also discuss how as a project manager you can create a plan to control your projects scope to ensure you have a plan to keep your work in line with your customers requirements.

According to the PMBOK Project scope management is “the processes to ensure that the project includes all of the work required, and only the work required, to complete the project successfully”. The project scope statement also meets the following criteria

   1.  It determines what is included in the project.
   2.  It serves as a guide to determine what work is not needed to complete the project objectives
   3.  It defines what work is needed to complete the project objectives.
   4.  It serves as a point of reference for what is not included in the project.

All this contributes to show that a Project Scope Statement is really just a statement that tells all stakeholders for the project what work is required to complete the project. It is a great tool for a project manager to determine what work is included on the project and all the project manager to add or remove work from the project.


[edit] Scope Planning Process

Inputs Project Charter, Preliminary project scope statement, project management plan

Outputs Scope Management plan

The Scope Management plan is a document that plays a key role at helping the project manager avoid possible issues with future scope changes, and scope creep. The Scope Management plan consists of some of the following characteristics.

1. It can be very formal or informal 2. The document describes how scope changes will be classified and identified 3. The plan describes how the project scope will be managed 4. The plan can be as detailed as the project manager deems necessary 5. This document is considered a subsidiary piece of the overall project management plan.
[edit] Chapter 8 Scope Definition

3.2.2.3 (5.2)


[edit] Chapter 9 Create WBS

3.2.2.4 (5.3)

The WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) is a method of representing work packages, from the high level down to the low level. The project may be &quot;Clean Kitchen&quot; and is made of secondary level work packages such as &quot;Wash Floor,&quot; &quot;Clean Fridge,&quot; and &quot;Wipe Countertops&quot;. &quot;Wash Floor&quot; might be broken down into &quot;Prepare Materials,&quot; &quot;Clear Floor of Objects,&quot; and &quot;Scrub&quot;.

Work Packages should be broken down to whatever level is needed; either common sense takes over or the project scope limits the detail level. This is graphically represented by something such as:
[edit] Chapter 10 Activity Definition

3.2.2.5 (6.1)
[edit] Chapter 11 Activity Sequencing

3.2.2.6 (6.2)

Activity sequencing is a process for identifying dependencies between scheduled events.
[edit] Chapter 12 Activity Resource Estimating

3.2.2.7 (6.3)

This process is required for finding out what types of resources are required for each scheduled activity.
[edit] Chapter 13 Activity Duration Estimating

3.2.2.8 (6.4)

This process tries to find out the number of work periods shall be required for each activity which has been scheduled.
[edit] Chapter 14 Schedule Development

3.2.2.9 (6.5)


This process is used to analyze sequences of activities, schedule constraints, resource requirements, and activity durations to come up with a feasible project schedule.
[edit] Chapter 15 Cost Estimating

3.2.2.10 (7.1)

A good cost estimation includes the identification of cost components through thorough research. This enables the costs of a project to be monitored, and while the project is in progress, avoids cost overruns.

Inaccuracies in the cost estimation are inevitable. The goal is to be as realistice as possible

Typical cost components include labour, supplies, materials, equipments, and overheads.


S-Curve.

The S Curve is a tool which consists of a display of cumulative costs, labour hours or other quantities plotted against time.

The name of the S-Curve comes from the S-like shape of the curve, flatter at the beginning and end and steeper in the middle. The S-curve is useful as a cost estimation tool because it is the way most of the projects look like in the real world.

The S curve can be used as an indicator for many applications related to project management such as: target, baseline, cost, and time.

There are multiple types of S curves and they include :

The Cost versus Time S Curve. This is useful for projects that contain labour and non-labour tasks.

The Target S Curve. This is useful for the ideal progress of the project if all tasks are completed as currently scheduled.

The Value and Percentage S Curve. This is a useful for calculating the project's actual percentage completion.

The Actual S Curve. This one ise useful in depicting the actual progress of the project until the present time.
[edit] Chapter 16 Cost Budgeting

3.2.2.11 (7.2) This process is used to find out the quality standards and metrics which shall be used in the project and also how they can be met satisfactorily. Budgeting means allocation of funds, suppose the estimate is of 100 units, but the money which can be provided for that activity is only 70 units. then 70 units becomes our budget. moreover it is the comprehensive short-term operational plan for a business.


The bill of materials defines the complete set of materials required in order to create a product.

The BOM can be in the form of a tree with multiple levels. It can also be in a document format which is indented to the lowest level required, so that it accurately lists all parts and raw materials needed to make the specified product.

The BOM is then used by the project manager and/or purchasing department to order any supplies which are necessary for the project.
[edit] Chapter 17 Quality Planning

3.2.2.12 (8.1)
[edit] Chapter 18 Human Resource Planning

3.2.2.13 (9.1)


This process is carried out to find out the human resources required for the project.

Also the roles of all team members.

Reporting relationships among members.

Responsibilites of team members

And creating a staffing management plan.

Types of bilateral procurment contrats

Request for Proposal (RFP): this is a request for a detailed proposal on price, how the work will be accomplished, skills and experience of the people to be included and various other details. These items of service are usually higher dollar value and tend to be for nonstandard items.

Request for Quotation (RFQ): requests a price quote per item and hour. These items are relatively low dollar value.

Invitation for Bid (IFB) or Request for Bid (RFB): requests a single price for the entire package of work. Items of service are usually high dollar value and are standard.

This process is used to observe the execution of the project. The objective is to identify problems and issues in a timely manner and suggest corrective action so that the project's objectives can be met.

By knowing the variances of the project from the plan, corrective action can be suggested.

This includes monitoring project parameters and comparing them to the performance baseline.

Preventing the circumvention integrated change control so that only approved changes ar implemented.

Thus avoiding scope creep and gold plating.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a few simple rules for matrix differentiation.  These allow much econometrics to be done in matrix form, which can be simpler and far less cumbersome than using nested summation signs.

''Differentiating an inner product with respect to a vector''

Let '''a''' be a given column vector and let '''x''' be a column choice vector (a vector of values to be chosen).  Their transposes can be denoted as '''a' ''' and '''x' '''.  Then the derivative of their inner product, which is a scalar, is a column vector:

:'''∂a'x/∂x = ∂x'a/∂x = a'''.

''Differentiating a quadratic form with respect to a vector''

Let '''A''' be a matrix, either symmetric or non-symmetric, and consider the quadratic form '''x'Ax''', which is itself a scalar.  The derivative of this quadratic form with respect to the vector '''x''' is the column vector

:'''∂x'Ax/∂x = (A+A')x'''.

But in econometrics, almost always the matrix in the quadratic form will be symmetric.  If '''A''' is indeed symmetric, the formula can be simplified to

:'''∂x'Ax/∂x = 2Ax'''.

''Application to Ordinary Least Squares''

Perhaps the most basic concept in econometrics is ordinary least squares, in which we choose the regression coefficients so as to minimize the sum of squared residuals (mispredictions) of the regression.  Suppose the regression model is

:'''y = Xβ + e''',

where '''y''' is an ''n''×1 vector of observed values of the dependent variable, '''X''' is an ''n×k'' matrix in which each column is an ''n''×1 vector of observed values of one of the ''k'' independent variables (''k&lt;n''), '''β''' is the ''k''×1 vector of estimated response coefficients to be chosen, and '''e''' is the ''n''×1 vector of residuals.

The reader may confirm that the sum of squared residuals&amp;mdash;the sum of the squares of the elements of '''e'''&amp;mdash;is given by

:'''e'e = (y - Xβ)'(y - Xβ) = y'y - y'Xβ - β'X'y + β'X'Xβ = y'y - 2β'(X'y) + β'(X'X)β'''

where the last equality holds because '''y'Xβ''' is a scalar and thus is its own transpose.  Note that '''(X'y)''' is a ''k''×1 vector and '''(X'X)''' is a ''k×k'' matrix.  Using the above rules for differentiation, we have

:'''∂e'e/∂β = -2X'y + 2(X'X)β''',

where we have used the fact that '''X'X''' is symmetric.  When we express the first-order condition by equating this vector derivative to the zero vector, we obtain

:'''(X'X)β = X'y''',

which can be solved for the choice vector '''β''' as

:'''β = (X'X)&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;X'y'''.

This is the ordinary least squares estimator.  Note that so long as '''X''' has full column rank, the expression '''(X'X)&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;''' exists and '''(X'X)''' is positive definite, ensuring that the second-order conditions are satisfied.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''&lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;''' keyword is discouraged as it makes it difficult to follow the program logic, this way inducing to errors. The '''&lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;''' statement causes the current thread of execution to jump to the specified label.

;Syntax
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
label:
  statement(s);

goto label;
&lt;/source&gt;

In some rare cases, the '''&lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;''' statement allows to write uncluttered code, for example, when handling multiple exit points leading to the cleanup code at a function exit (and neither exception handling or object destructors are better options). Except in those rare cases, the use of unconditional jumps is a frequent symptom of a complicated design, as the presence of many levels of nested statements.

In exceptional cases, like heavy optimization, a programmer may need more control over code behavior; a '''&lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;''' allows the programmer to specify that execution flow jumps directly and unconditionally to a desired label. A ''label'' is the name given to a label statement elsewhere in the function.

{{NOTE|note=There is a classic paper in software engineering by [[w:William Wulf|W. A. Wulf]] called [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1241523 &quot;A case against the GOTO&quot;], presented in the 25th [[w:Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] National Conference in October 1972, a time when the debate about '''&lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;''' statements was reaching its peak. In this paper Wulf defends that '''&lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;''' statements should be regarded as dangerous. Wulf is also known by one of his comments regarding efficiency: &quot;More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency (without necessarily achieving it) than for any other single reason -- including blind stupidity.&quot;.}}

A '''&lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;''' can, for example, be used to break out of two nested loops. This example breaks after replacing the first encountered non-zero element with zero. 
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 30; ++i) {
  for (int j = 0; j &lt; 30; ++j) {
    if (a[i][j] != 0) {
       a[i][j] = 0;
       goto done;
     }
  }
}
done:
/* rest of program */
&lt;/source&gt;

Although simple, they quickly lead to illegible and unmaintainable code. 
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// snarled mess of gotos

int i = 0;
  goto test_it;
body:
  a[i++] = 0;
test_it:
  if (a[i]) 
    goto body;
/* rest of program */
&lt;/source&gt;

is much less understandable than the equivalent:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
for (int i = 0; a[i]; ++i) {
  a[i] = 0;
}
/* rest of program */
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Goto'''s are typically used in functions where performance is critical or in the output of machine-generated code (like a parser generated by ''[[w:yacc|yacc]]''.)

The '''&lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;''' statement should almost always be avoided, there are rare cases when it enhances the readability of code. One such case is an &quot;error section&quot;.

'''Example'''
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;new&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

...

int *my_allocated_1 = NULL;
char *my_allocated_2 = NULL, *my_allocated_3 = NULL;
my_allocated_1 = new (std::nothrow) int[500];

if (my_allocated_1 == NULL)
{  
  std::cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;error in allocated_1&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  goto error;
}

my_allocated_2 = new (std::nothrow) char[1000];

if (my_allocated_2 == NULL)
{  
  std::cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;error in allocated_2&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  goto error;
}
    
my_allocated_3 = new (std::nothrow) char[1000];

if (my_allocated_3 == NULL)
{  
  std::cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;error in allocated_3&quot; &lt;&lt;std::endl;
  goto error;
}
return 0;
    
error:
  delete [] my_allocated_1;
  delete [] my_allocated_2;
  delete [] my_allocated_3;
  return 1;
&lt;/source&gt;

This construct avoids hassling with the origin of the error and is cleaner than an equivalent construct with control structures. It is thus less error prone.

{{NOTE|note=While the above example shows a reasonable use of '''goto'''s, it is uncommon in practice. ''Exceptions'' handle such cases in a clearer, more effective and more organized way. This will be discussed in &quot;Exception Handling&quot; in detail.  Using RAII to manage resources such as memory also avoids the need for most of the explicit cleanup code that is shown above.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Leigh

I hope you find my changes acceptable. From my perspective, the OP case needs to be presented first followed by the history and principles of OER which you have outlined - course ware, copyright etc. The material is great and has lots of detail, but I am being ruthless to make it more readable for people who I know will want the quick and dirty info and shorter descriptions. The arguments you provide are great, and could be presented as more of a positive debate of both view points to convince them rather than an impassioned and sometimes negative lecture. I have suggested some of the detail is linked to another page to make it easier to read - you will see where. Perhaps Social networking and participatory culture needs to be shortened with links to the detail - can you pull out the absolute important bits you want to include. I have had a go but feel these sections are still too long. I have done my bit on this page.  --[[User:Bronwynh|Bronwynh]] ([[User talk:Bronwynh|talk]]) 05:47, 11 August 2010 (UTC) 

I don't think you need the following about learning objects - it is too negative. 

From 2001 - 2004 there probably wasn't an eLearning Unit on the planet that had not discussed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_object re-usable learning object (LO)] theory. &lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot;&gt; This statement needs to be backed up with a reference. &lt;/font color&gt;  The development of learning objects was entirely tied to interoperability within Learning Management Systems, and attracted [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_Object#Learning_object_projects very large investments in the period]. &lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot;&gt; This statement needs to be backed up with a reference. I would dispute this statement as they were also developed as stand alone resources, well before LMS arrived - e.g. Merlot from 1997. Also AUS Toolboxes can operate separate to a LMS. So I think this needs to be reworded. &lt;/font color&gt;  The energy and commitment behind learning object development has waned considerably in recent years, to a point to which it is a rarely talked about and generally a rarely considered area in today's eLearning Units. &lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot;&gt; This statement needs to be backed up with a reference. &lt;/font color&gt;  


Is this a 2007 or 2010 statement? - &quot;Today it has 251 language editions with the English version alone containing 1,778,031 articles!&quot;--[[User:Bronwynh|Bronwynh]] ([[User talk:Bronwynh|talk]]) 03:04, 4 August 2010 (UTC)</text>

'''Chimichurri''' is a South American sauce for meats containing primarily oil, vinegar, parsley, red chilli and herbs. There are many different variants of chimichurri, and every cook will have their own private recipe. Chimichurri can be used as a marinade or sauce for grilled or roasted meats, or as a dipping sauce for [[Cookbook:empanadas|empanadas]]

==Ingeredients==

* 100 ml [[Cookbook:olive oil|olive oil]]
* 50 ml white [[Cookbook:wine vinegar|wine vinegar]]
* 50 ml [[Cookbook:water|water]]

* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:salt|sea salt]] flakes
* 1 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]

===Optional ingredients===
Depending on taste you can add any combination of the following:

* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:thyme|thyme]], finely chopped
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:lemon|lemon]] juice
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:bay leaf|bay leaf]], small flakes
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:coriander|coriander]], finely chopped
* 1/2 green [[Cookbook:bell Pepper|bell pepper]], deseeded and finely chopped (instead of green pepper, if used)

;Red chimichurri
* 50 ml red [[Cookbook:wine vinegar|wine vinegar]] (instead of white wine vinegar)
* 1 [[Cookbook:tomato|tomato]], peeled, seeded, finely chopped
* 1/2 red bell pepper, deseeded and finely chopped

==Method==
* Combine all the ingredient except the oil, vinegar and water to a large bowl and mix together well, ensuring all the herbs and spices (especially the salt) are distributed evenly.
* Allow to rest for 30 minutes.
* Bring the the the vinegar and water to the boil, add to the other ingredients and mix well. This helps to soften the taste of the onion and garlic.
* Allow to rest for 30 minutes.
* Add the oil and mix well. If the liquid part doesn't cover the ingredients add oil water and vinegar in a 2:1:1 ratio to cover them.
* Transfer to an air-tight container and refrigerate overnight at least, or better, for a few days.
* When needed, remove from refrigerator about 30 minutes ahead of time to allow the oil to thin out again. Stir well and serve.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Shemini—“Eighth”    Vayikra/Leviticus 9:1-11:14

&lt;u&gt;Symbolism of the Eighth Day&lt;/u&gt;

The name of the Parsha, Shemini, means “the eighth,” and refers to the day on which Aaron and his sons were inducted as the priests of the Sanctuary.  There is a relationship between the numbers “seven” and “eight” in Torah. “Seven” is associated with the physical space and time.  The “level of holiness” man is capable of reaching in this world is symbolized by the number seven. “Eight” represents a level of holiness beyond the normal confines of space and time.   It is related to “being wholly united with Yahweh as He is in Himself, rather than as He is related to the world.”  This is why a circumcision is done on the eighth day and can be performed on Shabbat (which is the “seventh day” of every week).  Shabbat belongs to physical space and time, but circumcision belongs to the realm of the Holy.  “Eight” thus represents a level of holiness that goes beyond the idea that God and the world are two distinct entities.

The number eight is associated with the Time of the Redemption. 
As seen in this Parsha, the “seven days” working on the Tabernacle prepared everyone for the “eighth” day, when they experienced the presence of God.  This is related to the idea of seven thousand years of human history (including the Millennial Kingdom) followed by the “eighth day” of the Olam Haba (World to Come).


&lt;u&gt;The Consecration&lt;/u&gt;

And he said to Aaron: “Take you a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for an ascent offering, without blemish, and offer them before God.    “And to the children of Israel you shall speak, saying: Take a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before God; and a meal offering mingled with oil;
“For today God will appear to you...”

The offerings are brought as instructed, following which, Moshe and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of God appeared to all the people.    Leviticus 9:22-24

In an awesome display of His holiness, Aaron, the High Priest, blesses the people and a fire consumes the burnt offering.  At this point,  the children of Israel shout and fall on their faces.  Apparently, the Holy One was pleased with their obedience and He accepts their offerings by His Shekinah appearing again, the first time since the Tabernacle was finished.   Now with all the preparations completed and the priests ready to minister, the Tabernacle can begin to be used for what it was intended.

The Talmud tells us that when the fire came down from heaven, 
1.  It crouched majestically over the altar like a lion.
2.  It’s flame was of a substance that appeared solid
3.  It was able to devour even wet wood.
4.  It caused no smoke    
This only happened on three other recorded occasions - at the birth of Samson (Judges 13); at the dedication of Solomon’s temple (2 Chronicles 7); and when Elijah challenged the prophets of Baal.  (1 Kings 18)  -   Also in Acts 2 with the tongues of fire.
Then within some undetermined amount of time, tragedy comes to the House of Aaron.  For unstated reasons, Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron take unauthorized fire before Yahweh and in His displeasure He consumes them with fire from the altar.  When you reflect on the descriptive verses, you can readily conclude that reverence, respect and awe for the Holy One of Israel are some of the things that He requires of His servants.   


&lt;u&gt;Strange Fire&lt;/u&gt;

Nadav and Avihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire in it, and put incense on it, and offered strange fire before God, which He commanded them not.   A fire went out from God, and consumed them, and they died before God. (10:1-2)
Aaron’s sons died on account of four things: “For drawing near&quot;--because they entered into the innermost precincts of the Sanctuary.  “For offering&quot;--because they offered a sacrifice which they had not been commanded to offer.  “For the strange fire&quot;--which they brought, not as commanded.  “And for not having taken counsel from each other&quot;--as it says, “Each of them his censer,” implying that they acted each on his own initiative, not taking counsel from one another.

“Then Moshe said to Aaron, ‘It is what Yahweh spoke, saying, “By those who come near Me I will be treated as holy, And before all the people I will be honoured&quot;’  So Aaron,  therefore, kept silent” (Vayikra/Leviticus10:3)

Aaron’s sons, Nadav and Avihu, sinned with fire and were punished with death by fire.
However, within a few short verses, the text turns to the problem of serving Yahweh while under the intoxicating influence of “wine or strong drink”.  Hence it has been concluded by Biblical scholars that it is conceivable that Nadab and Abihu could have been under the influence of alcohol and that they simply did not show a reverent fear of the Holy One.  As an example for eternity, the dramatic loss of life by a consuming fire has indelibly reminded people in positions of spiritual responsibility that the Holy One requires absolute sobriety when one is conducting his priestly duties.

In Ecclesiastes 5:1, it is written,  “Guard your steps when you go to the house of God; for to draw near to listen is better than to give the sacrifice of fools, for they don’t know that they do evil.” (HNV revised)

The Artscroll Chumash says that they went into the Tabernacle after having had wine.  (p. 594)   Many other Rabbis also understand this to have been the case.  The same fire which blessed the people for meeting His requirements of obedience in doing things after His pattern, destroyed those who did not.   Surely our God is a consuming fire.

Anyone who does not come to God His way, is approaching Him in rebellion and disobedience. That was the sin of Nadab and Abihu.  They thought they could come to God another way, their way.   In doing so they elevated themselves to a position of insolence to the Most High, presuming they could enter His Presence on their own merit and in their own way, as having the power to choose what the Almighty should accept from them.

This is not a judgement that occurred because they were under a different covenant.  It was not just how God handled rebellion and disobedience in the Old Covenant.  He did similar in Acts chapter 5 with Ananias and Sapphira.  The difference today is that we do not have His manifest Presence amongst us.    The heavenly fire is missing whenever complete dedication is missing.

Yahweh’s fire falls on the sacrifices that are offered with hearts completely dedicated to Him, as it is written in 1 Kings 18:38,  “Then the fire of Yahweh fell, and consumed the ascension offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.&quot;(HNV revised)  But the fire will consume those who come before Him in arrogance and self-will.
If we want to experience the glory of Yahweh’s fire in our lives, we must give ourselves as ascension offerings with hearts completely dedicated to Him.   Then the fire will fall as in Acts 2: 3,    “Tongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them, and one sat on each of them.&quot;(HNV)


&lt;u&gt;Separation Unto Him&lt;/u&gt;

As the text continues, the linkage is made to the requirement to make a distinction between the holy and the profane and the clean and the unclean.   This is where the balance of the portion begins to rivet our attention For it is in this verse where the Hebrew word badal,translated for “distinction or separation,” becomes the primary emphasis.  Here the royal priesthood, the nation of priests, the children of Israel who have been called out to be, as Isaiah declares centuries later a “light unto the nations,&quot;are commanded to make a distinction between the holy and the profane and to understand the difference between the clean and the unclean.

And Moshe called Mishael and Elzafan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them: “Come near, carry your brothers from before the Sanctuary out of the camp.” So they went near, and carried them in their robes out of the camp; as Moshe had said.

Because of the centrality of their role in the revelation of the Divine Presence in the Sanctuary that day, Aaron and his two remaining sons are forbidden to engage in any of the customary mourning practices:  “And Moshe said to Aaron, and to Elazar and to Itamar, his sons:  “Let not the hair of your heads grow long, neither rend your clothes; lest you die, and lest anger come upon all the people. Your brethren, the whole house of Israel, shall bewail the conflagration which God has burned...&quot;
And they did according to the word of Moshe.

Nadab and Abihu were executed by the fire of Yahweh for not following his commandments. Likewise, at the end of the Messianic Age (Millennium) unrepentant sinners will be executed by the fire of Yahweh in the Lake of Fire. We are now living in an age of grace where, thankfully, each of our sinful actions is not met by instant divine judgment. Does knowing that we will not be instantly “zapped” when we sin cause us to become lax and even calloused toward sin in our lives? Do we truly walk in the fear of Yahweh? Do we fear the consequences of sin even though the results may not be immediate? How loose is your spiritual walk? How many hidden sins that no one knows about do you have that you are failing to deal with? The path of righteousness is becoming narrower and narrower. Not everyone is going to be “the greatest in the Kingdom of heaven” (Mt. 5:19).


&lt;u&gt;The Clean and the Unclean&lt;/u&gt;

“‘For I am Yahweh your God Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy.  And you shall not make yourselves unclean with any of the swarming things that swarm on the earth.  For I am Yahweh who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God; thus you shall be holy, for I am holy”  (Vayikra/Leviticus11:44-45)

This week’s Torah portion contains the laws of distinguishing between clean and unclean animals. The Bible says that those animals which God designates as unclean are not to be regarded as food.
When God speaks about that which is unclean and clean in Scripture, He not referring to physical cleanliness. Yahweh God has taken everything in the world and divided it into two categories,  - That which is clean and that which is unclean.  Everything unclean He has placed in the category of sin and death, Whereas every thing clean is in the realm of life and righteousness.

Coming into contact with anything which God has declared unclean, by either touching or eating it, renders a person “tamei” or spiritually unclean, they have come into contact with what God has declared to be in the realm of sin and death.  This does not mean that the person is now physically or morally unclean, but that they are spiritually unclean and therefore unable to participate in communal worship.  They will remain in this tamei state until they have taken the necessary steps to become “tahor” or clean. So the kashrut laws were given to us for the purpose of being holy, why?  Because our God is holy!

“Therefore,gird up your minds, be sober, hope perfectly on the grace to be brought to you at the revealing of Yeshua the Messiah  As obedient children, do not be conformed to the previous lusts of your former ignorance, but like the Holy One Who called you, be holy yourselves also in all of your conduct,because it is written, ‘YOU SHALL BEHOLY, FOR I AM HOLY'” (1Peter 1:13-16)

The reason why God gave us the dietary commandments and why certain animals such as pigs, shrimp, crabs, lobsters, and birds of prey are considered inedible, is because Yahweh is a holy God who makes distinction between the clean and unclean and He wants us to live it out in our daily lives.  Many Christians might scoff at the idea that separating clean and unclean meats is archaic and too “Old Testament.”   But how many of the same fail to separate the clean and unclean when choosing friends?  How many of the same fail to separate clean and unclean when reading books, watching television, or looking up Internet websites? You see, even “smaller” principles as they relate to what we eat can have larger consequences.  For when we learn to separate “small” things that He considers acceptable and unacceptable, we will learn how to separate much larger things and be part of the separated people that He desires.

Their food is one of the most important things that mark the difference between the children of Israel and other people.  This chapter teaches us that what man eats is very important to Yahweh.  From the beginning He has been very interested in man’s diet.  The first commandment given to man had to do with food.  Sin came into the world through forbidden food.  So, if what man eats is so important to Yahweh, it ought to be important to man as well.  Yahweh is the one who determines what is important and what is of less importance for man.  The Scriptures teach us that what we eat is very important.  Food has a lot to do with consecration and sin.

According to Rabbi Shaul, when a person does any part of Torah to earn, merit or keep any part of his atonement, his justification received by grace through faith and accomplished in total by the death and resurrection of Yeshua Messiah, then that becomes legalism!  It should not be done at all.  But, on the other hand, because Yahweh has written Torah on our heart as a New Creation, it has now become part of our basic identity.  We then can join with Rabbi Shaul as well as tens of thousands of other Jewish believers about whom it is said in Acts 21:20, “You see, brother, how tens of thousands of Jews have believed, and all of them are zealous for the Torah.”
We can be zealous for keeping the Torah in an attitude of devotion and reverence for Yahweh our God.
If Shaul wanted to teach against a believer, especially a Jewish believer, living according to the Torah (which would include the dietary laws), this would be the time to nail it down.  But, in fact, he teaches the opposite and confirms that not only is it permissible but he himself lives that way too!

Thus, if Israel, especially the believers in Messiah among Israel--and those who are grafted into Israel--see the importance of maintaining our identity as a holy nation,  just like our spiritual forefathers did by expressing it through the Torah of the dietary laws, then why should anyone be discouraged from it.


&lt;u&gt;A Wholesome Lifestyle of Daily Bread&lt;/u&gt; 
  
The biblical kosher (or kasher/rvk [Strong’s H#3787] meaning to be straight, right, acceptable) laws involve many areas: health issues, holiness (not defiling the body, the temple of Yahweh’s Set-apart Spirit), separation issues we’re to act, live, eat, worship, think, dress and talk differently than the heathens around us. We’re a called-out and sanctified (set apart) people. Therefore, we do not have the liberty to act, speak, dress, eat and live the way the heathens do.  We can’t expect to be called the Children of the Most High yet live like the children of the world.  We must choose who we are going to serve: Yahweh or Mamon.

The same God who has placed boundaries around our behavior in every other area of life has placed boundaries around our diets. If we acknowledge that he has the authority to regulate our sexual inclinations and appetites, we must also recognize he has the authority to regulate our stomachs.
“Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God will do away with both of them. Yet the body is not for immorality, but for Yahweh, and Yahweh is for the body.” (1 Corinthians 6:13)
In chapter 11 instructions are given with regard to clean and unclean foods.   The dietary laws of Kashrus were lovingly given to protect us.  “You shall worship Yahweh, your God, and He shall bless your bread and your water, and I shall remove illness from the midst of you.”    Exodus 23:25

Oftentimes, many of the diseases that scourge and ravage our bodies today are brought on because of what we eat. We eat unwholesome foods, junk and fast foods, which were not sanctified biblically. These unwholesome foods over a period of time begin to attack our bodies with sickness and lead to many chronic illnesses that are preventable if we follow the prescribed diets that were given to us biblically. We would greatly enhance our quality and length of life, if we were to follow Yahweh’s grocery list.

Many brethren are led to believe that it is acceptable to eat pig. They readily quote: “I Timothy 4:3-4 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving.&quot;

On face value, this particular passage of scripture would do nicely to license one to eat whatever she/he wishes since every creature God has created is good, and that nothing is to be refused if received with prayer and thanksgiving right?  This in fact is a good example of taking a text out of context.  Many who quote and use this text fail to read verse 5, “For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.” Sanctification means that which is set apart, holy.  And in order for us to know what is sanctified by Yahweh’ word, we would need to return to the book of Leviticus and read chapter 11, which details for us the laws of Kashrus.   Unclean animals are not holy - set apart for us to eat.

If we are what we eat, then by mere deductive reasoning we can logically conclude that if we eat that which is not sanctified by Yahweh’ word; then are we not eating what pagans eat?  This of course places us smack in the middle of idolatry.  In order for our bread to be blessed, we would first need to worship Him.  In order to worship Yahweh, it requires us to obey His commands.  And if we obey His commands, then are we entitled to all His many benefits.  Let us not fall for the entrapments of apostasy, but let us return to our first love, Yahweh.
Let Us Run This Race with endurance!   


&lt;u&gt;Clean and unclean meats:&lt;/u&gt; 

11:4, 47 The word unclean is tawmay meaning defiled, impure, polluted ethically, ritually or religiously and the word clean is tahowr which means pure physically, ceremonially, morally, ethically.  In verse 43 Yahweh says that in eating unclean meats one becomes abominable (or detestable, filthy). In Ezekiel 22:26 Yahweh rebukes his people because, “Her priests have violated my Torah-law, and have profaned my set-apart/kadosh things: they have put no difference between the set-apart/kadosh and profane/polluted/common, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.” In Leviticus 11: 45 the Torah states: For I am Yahweh that brings you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your Yahweh: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.” 

What is Yahweh trying to tell us here about the foods we eat? Is this more than just an issue of physical health? Why the mention of leaving Egypt here?  There are many issues here that need to be explored. How serious are you about obedience?  Is your god your belly?  Do your taste buds or the Word of Yahweh rule your life? 
Remember, Torah covers all aspects of life: physical, spiritual, emotional, relational, etc. Torah is a very holistic handbook on life.  Are you one who takes the (humanistic) pick-and-choose approach to Torah-obedience?:  “I’ll obey only the biblical (dietary) laws that suit me.”   Isn’t this akin to what the serpent told Adam and Eve?:  “You can have it your way...Yahweh didn’t really mean what he said when it comes to obedience.&quot;

We obey him simply because he has said these things. It is certainly true that when we obey the commandments we will have a long life and health in our bodies. It is also true that the meat of several of these unclean animals is harmful and may contain things that are dangerous for man to eat. It is also true that the nature of the animals is in the blood, and if one eats part of their blood, which is unavoidable when eating meat, it is possible that the nature of the animals affect the character of the person who eats it. These things are secondary, however, and the Torah does not focus on them. The Torah says that one who avoids eating certain animals that have been classified by heaven as unclean, will be consecrated. These rules have mainly to do with consecration, and consecration has a lot to do with food. Obedience to these commands will also bring healing. A bi-product of this obedience is health and prosperity in all things, but the main purpose for these commandments is, as mentioned, not man’s health, but his consecration.


&lt;u&gt;Specified Clean Foods&lt;/u&gt;

Animals have to have a split hoof and chew the cud. Horses chew the cud but do not have a split hoof. Rabbits chew the cud but do not have a hoof. Pigs have a split hoof but do not chew the cud. These animals are all unclean. Here are most of the (Torah) clean animals from Leviticus 11: sheep, goats, cows, dear, oxen, buffalo and moose all have split hooves and chew the cud. Here are some unclean animals: dog, cat, possum, squirrel, rat, ferret, monkey, kangaroo, elephant, rhinoceros and all reptiles.

Fish have to have both scales and fins to be clean. It would be easier to list a few of the common unclean fishes than all the clean. Among the unclean are: catfish, squid, octopus, shellfish, dolphin, whale, jellyfish, crab, shrimp, eel, mussels, abalone, clam, tuna etc..   Fish with fins and scales live in the higher and clearer waters. They are sustained by the air that enters there, and therefore their bodies contain a certain amount of heat which counteracts the abundance of moistness of the waters. The fish which do not have fins and scales dwell in the lower turbulent waters and cannot repel the abundance of moistness in their native habitat. Hence, the cold fluid in the area in which they swim, cleaves to them and can cause death to people who consume them.


&lt;u&gt;Spiritual Issues&lt;/u&gt;

In 2 Corinthians 6:16-17 we read: “And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith Yahweh, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.”

The issue of clean/pure and unclean/polluted/abominable meats is not simply a dietary/health consideration, but a spiritual issue with Yahweh.   Both Moshe (Lev. 19:2) and the Apostolic writers had a clear sense of the fact that without holiness no one will see Yahweh (Heb. 12:14),  and that holiness or being kadosh/set-apart from the ways, lifestyles, ideologies of this world (i.e., from spiritual Egypt) is an absolute requirement of Yahweh for his people. Is it possible to spiritualize away the concept of set-apartness and still be true to Scripture?  Can one be spiritually sanctified (set-apart) through the atoning work of Yeshua at the cross, but then have a polluted lifestyle?   In other words, can one follow the spirit of the law and violate the letter and still be acceptable to Yahweh?   What did James say about faith without works (James 2:20)?   What did Yeshua teach at the Sermon On the Mount (Matt. 5-7) about uniting the letter and the spirit of the law and practicing both?

The Holy Spirit enables us now to keep His commandments and convicts us when we are about to violate His commandments.  This creates more liberality for those who have received the Messiah and the Holy Spirit.  We are no longer under a system where we are bound to consult a written code of interpretation of the Torah.   The law is spiritual and a liberated spirit whose heart is renewed in such a way as to desire to obey, walks in liberty in the keeping of the commandments - they are not burdensome.
 
We become holy (kadosh/set-apart) through the blood of Yeshua, the Lamb of God and we remain sanctified by retaining our fellowship with Him by confessing and forsaking sin. on a regular basis.   (1 John 3:4) 

“If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness (our own ways=sin) we lie, and do not the truth,  but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Yeshua Messiah his Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:6-9)

“Come now, and let us reason together, saith Yahweh: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.” (Isaiah 1:18) 

Yahweh cares about our entire person: body, soul and spirit (1 Thessalonians 5:23). 
We are to worship and serve him with the totality of our being (with all our heart, soul and might (Deut. 6:5; Mark 12:30).   At the beginning He made us in his very own likeness/image (Gen. 1:26), and He gave instructions as to what we were to eat.   The original sin was in regard to what was eaten.   Man chose to disobey and eat from the wrong ‘tree’, contrary to the command of Yahweh.  There is a saying, You are what you eat.  Adam and Eve sinned when they ate of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.  They became defiled by what they ate.  

That which is pure and set-apart/clean, is good while that which is polluted, defiled or unclean is evil in the eyes of Yahweh. 

What are some other ways we can defile/pollute/destroy the Temple of our bodies? Alcoholism, nicotine, junk food, pornography, illicit sex, watching immoral and unrighteous movies and television gossip/slander and wrong thoughts (lust, bitterness, pride, etc.) to name a few.

Have you turned away from eating things which are abominable physically and also that which is polluted spiritually (traditions of men which nullify the Word of Yahweh, lies, false doctrines, false teachings, false prophets and false messiahs (i.e. those we reverence and from who we take counsel?)     
We need to cleanse ourselves from every defilement of the flesh and the spirit and be clean in His sight. Babylon means mixture or confusion and in the last days Yahweh is calling his people out of Babylon (Rev. 18:4). 

From which tree are you feeding?  .... from the Tree of Knowledge or from the Tree of Life ??? (1 Timothy 4:5)?

Thekohser-v.2 is '''Gregory Kohs''' in real life, founder of [http://www.mywikibiz.com MyWikiBiz.com].  This account is to overcome an improper out-of-process auto-lock on an old account.  No worries, I have not the least intention of vandalizing or disrupting Wikibooks in any way whatsoever.

During my Wikimedia Board of Trustees candidate run, I leveled strong criticism against an English Wikibooks chapter within the ''United States History'' text.  I will attempt to help improve the design of the current textbook, so that I am not misinterpreted as a complete sourpuss.  I studied the Second World War at the BA level (magna cum laude) and at the MA and C.Phil levels.</text>

Do you know when the term &quot;strategic bombing&quot; came into use? --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] ([[User talk:JWSchmidt|talk]]) 15:29, 5 August 2010 (UTC)

:Thekohser-v.2 has been globally blocked, but he tells me that October 1918 seems to be when it was coined, but 1942 was when it came into repeated use, and 1943 in widespread use. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:04, 6 August 2010 (UTC)

:::It was &quot;globally locked by [[User:Jyothis]] as a sock of a globally banned user on [[m:|Meta Wiki]].&quot; [[User:Diego Grez|Diego Grez]] ([[User talk:Diego Grez|talk]]) 17:04, 7 August 2010 (UTC)

:::::Keep in mind that I get less experience at Wikibooks with problematic users than admins elsewhere, but it seems to me that socks are usually designated based on similar behaviors between two users.  To know for sure would require CheckUser action, which I don't perform unless there's disruption involved.  Globally banned from my perspective means that a steward at Meta has decided that a user has been disruptive at enough wikis that they lose the privilege of editing at all wikis.  The details of when or why I don't really get involved in as I'm not a steward.  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:22, 7 August 2010 (UTC)
::::::&quot;Globally banned from my perspective means that a steward at Meta has decided that a user has been disruptive at enough wikis that they lose the privilege of editing at all wikis.&quot; &lt;-- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]], can you link to the policy on global bans? --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] ([[User talk:JWSchmidt|talk]]) 22:08, 7 August 2010 (UTC)
{{outdent|::::::}} [[m:Steward requests/Global|Steward requests/Global]] where people request accounts to be globally banned links to [[m:Global blocking|Global blocking]], which details a ''guideline''.  However, the paragraph on local unblocking I know only applies to IP users.  The talk page confirms that the page I'm linking to really only applies to IPs. According to what I've read, I should be using the term &quot;global lock&quot; rather than &quot;global block&quot; when referring to this account.  [[m:Global locking|Global locking]] doesn't exist, so I'd say there is no hard and fast policy on global locking. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:33, 7 August 2010 (UTC)

:Also maybe relevant: apparently some stewards feel it's necessary to implement a local block in addition to a global lock, even if the user never edited at Wikibooks and even if doing so is redundant: see [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:BlockList&amp;hideaddressblocks=1&amp;hidetempblocks=1 this log] for anything tagged &quot;crosswiki abuse&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!--globally locked; about bot--&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;. This could make sense for local accounts that are detached from a unified account or for an account that isn't SUL.  However, I've checked a few and this isn't always the case. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:50, 7 August 2010 (UTC)
::&quot;here people request accounts to be globally banned&quot; &lt;-- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]], I see no use of the word &quot;ban&quot; at [[m:Steward requests/Global|Steward requests/Global]], so why do you describe that page as the place to go when requesting a global ban? &quot;no hard and fast policy on global locking&quot; &lt;-- &quot;[[m:Steward handbook#Managing global accounts|Accounts should never be locked except in cases of certain bad faith.]]&quot;. &quot;[[m:Locked global account|This is done to stop abuse such as spamming, vandalizing, or creating malicious account names.]]&quot; What evidence is there that the [[User:Thekohser-v.2]] account has been associated with spamming, vandalizing, or creating malicious account names? --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] ([[User talk:JWSchmidt|talk]]) 00:56, 8 August 2010 (UTC)

This discussion is important and should be moved to a more visible place, like [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General]] the issue of this discussion was initiated in [[User talk:Thekohser]] (it deals with the local community rights and freedoms, block and unblock process, cross-wiki administrative actions, edit protection of a blocked user's talk pages without demonstrated abuse on project). I've been fallowing only locally the actions '''against''' the user and I am not particularly happy on how and what has been done, especially since the user local activity has only been productive.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:01, 8 August 2010 (UTC)

:I agree that the discussion would be more fruitful in a general forum.  As for the word of &quot;ban&quot;, Diego above and JW above both use the term.  I've also seen &quot;community ban&quot; mentioned before, though I've not participated in such a thing.  I used &quot;ban&quot; because apparently &quot;global block&quot; is not technically correct.  However, to be technically correct, I guess I should only use &quot;global lock&quot; or &quot;globally locked&quot;.  As for evidence, this account being associated with another account that is globally locked is what got it locked.  I can't speak for the circumstances surrounding [[User:Thekohser]].  I've only been told that he is &quot;globally banned&quot; and &quot;for good reason&quot;.  My purview is Wikibooks and I've not really followed the controversy that led to the global lock. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 03:01, 8 August 2010 (UTC)

::We seem to be in general agreement that something isn't clear around this subject and that it is of some importance and impact to the project and that we all need to have some clarification...
::It is hard to define and establish the technical term on actions that seem unique and obscure (even if not intentionally so), of note is also that they have gone unchallenged here (it seems other projects did protest or even reverted the action for what was said on the other talk page) and have been supported by some local admins.
::If no objections arise a summary of the issues with relevant links should be made at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General]] so we can bring them to the community attention for an examination of the subject as to obtain a validation/repudiation for what has been happening.

      <comment>Dan Polansky moved page [[Talk:Perl Programming/The if Control Structure]] to [[Talk:Perl Programming/Conditionals]]: A simpler yet still clear name</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I think the ''if'' definition should say

&lt;nowiki&gt;if (boolean expression) {
    statement
}&lt;/nowiki&gt; 

with &quot;statement&quot; instead of &quot;expression&quot;

I'm just learning perl, so I don't dare to make the change myself. However, AFAIK, the if statement doesn't return the values of the statements/expressions executed.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several tactical constructs aimed at capturing stones.&lt;ref&gt;Kim 1994 pp. 80–98&lt;/ref&gt; These are among the first things a player learns after understanding the rules. Recognizing the possibility that stones can be captured using these techniques is an important step forward.
==Ladder==
&lt;div class=&quot;thumb tright&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbinner&quot; style=&quot;width:184px; font-size: 100%;&quot;&gt;
{{Goban 9x9|=
   | ul|  u|  u|  u|  u|  u|  u|  u|  u|=
   |  l|   |  w|   |   |   |   |   |   |=
   |  l|  w|  b|  w|   |   |   |   |   |=
   |  l|  w| b1| b3| w4|   |   |   |   |=
   |  l|   | w2| b5| b7| w8|   |   |   |=
   |  l|   |   | w6| b9|   |   |   |   |=
   |  l|   |   |   | 10|   |   |   |   |=
   |  l|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |=
   |  l|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |20}}

&lt;div class=&quot;thumbcaption&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 88%;&quot;&gt;
A ladder. Black cannot escape unless the ladder connects to friendly stones further down the board.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The most basic technique is the ''ladder''.&lt;ref name=Ladder&gt;Kim 1994 pp. 88–90&lt;/ref&gt; To capture stones in a ladder, a player uses a constant series of ''atari'' to force the opponent into a zigzag pattern as shown in the diagram to the right. Unless the pattern runs into friendly stones along the way, the stones in the ladder cannot avoid capture. Experienced players will recognize the futility of continuing the pattern and will play elsewhere. The presence of a ladder on the board does give a player the option to play a stone in the path of the ladder, thereby threatening to rescue their stones, forcing a response. Such a move is called a ''ladder breaker'' and may prove a powerful strategic response. In the diagram, Black has the option of playing a ladder breaker.

==Net==
&lt;div class=&quot;thumb tleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbinner&quot; style=&quot;width:184px; font-size: 100%;&quot;&gt;
{{Goban 9x9|=
   | ul|  u|  u|  u|  u|  u|  u|  u|  u|=
   |  l|   |  b|   |   |   |   |   |   |=
   |  b|   |  b|  w|  w|   |   |   |   |=
   |  l|  b|  w|  b|  w|   |   |   |   |=
   |  l|   |  w|  b|   |   |   |   |   |=
   |  l|   |  w|  b|   |   |   |   |   |=
   |  l|   |  w|   | w1|   |   |   |   |=
   |  l|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |=
   |  l|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |20}}

&lt;div class=&quot;thumbcaption&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 88%;&quot;&gt;
A net. The chain of three black stones cannot escape in any direction.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Another technique to capture stones is the so-called ''net'',&lt;ref name=Net&gt;Kim 1994 pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; also known by its Japanese name, ''geta''. This refers to a move that loosely surrounds some stones, preventing their escape in all directions. An example is given in the diagram to the left. It is generally better to capture stones in a net than in a ladder, because a net does not depend on the condition that there are no opposing stones in the way, nor does it allow the opponent to play a strategic ladder breaker.

==Snapback==
&lt;div class=&quot;thumb tright&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbinner&quot; style=&quot;width:184px; font-size: 100%;&quot;&gt;
{{Goban 9x9|=

A snapback. Although Black can capture the white stone by playing at the circled point, White can then ''snap back'' by playing at '''1''' again.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
A third technique to capture stones is the ''snapback''.&lt;ref name=SnapBack&gt;Kim 1994 pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; In a snapback, one player allows a single stone to be captured, then immediately plays on the point formerly occupied by that stone; by so doing, the player captures a larger group of their opponent's stones, in effect ''snapping back'' at those stones. An example can be seen on the right. As with the ladder, an experienced player will not play out such a sequence, recognizing the futility of capturing only to be captured back immediately.

[[Image:Completing the square 307.PNG|right]]
Let's pretend that you are the person that invented agriculture.

Let's say that you figured out that when you put seeds in the ground in a square plot that is 10 paces by 10 paces you find that you have enough wheat to keep yourself fed while the next crop grows.  Having done this you find that you have lots of time on your hands so you start thinking.  Pretty soon you've discovered how to catch live wild birds.  You find that if you feed your birds some of your grain they lay eggs for you which go nicely with the wheat that you've been eating.  Unfortunately since you didn't increase the amount of wheat that you planted you find that you come up a little short at the end of the season and have to eat your birds.  Since you're no dummy (you invented agriculture didn't you!) you land on the idea of using stones to keep track of the wheat you eat, and the amount of wheat a single bird eats.   The next season you decide to plant wheat in a plot that is 11 X 11 paces.  Your stones tell you that you eat 10 times as much wheat as your birds, and you have some wheat left over.

We know that the area of land to grow the amount of wheat you need is &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;. 
We know that the amount of wheat that a bird needs is 1/10th what you need or 1/10 &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The amount of wheat you need is equal to 100 square paces.  So &lt;math&gt; x^2 = 100.&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging that into the equation we get:

&lt;math&gt; 100 + (1/10 * 100) = s&lt;/math&gt;  where s=the square paces you need for you and your bird.

&lt;math&gt; 110 = s&lt;/math&gt;

Since your last field of wheat was 11 x 11 square paces or 121 square paces you have 11 square paces worth of wheat left over.  So you catch another bird.

Why did we use the the terms &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1/10x^2&lt;/math&gt; above?  &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; is the term that we use to figure out the amount of land we need, but since our point of view is currently ourselves we can use variables like h for human, b for bird.  In fact in the exercises below we will figure out values for other variables.  Following the exercises we will change our point of view, and see how this change led to considerations like what are shown in the diagram on the right.

Exercises: 
1) You decide to change the size of your field to 12 X 12.  How many birds can you raise?  
2) How many birds can you raise on a 13 X 13 field? 
3) You can grow a new crop every 90 days in the spring, summer, and fall. Unfortunately in the winter your crop won't grow, so you need to save enough grain to get you and your birds through the winter.  Try to write an equation that shows you how much grain you need to save for winter.
4) You can collect one egg a day from your birds.  The birds live for 3 years, but you always eat the oldest bird because its the biggest.  If you don't want to catch any more birds how many do you need to keep in order to have one egg every day and a bird for dinner every 9 days?
5) You decide to get a dog for company and protection.  Your dog also needs meat as well as wheat.  Feeding the dog requires 9 birds a season and 1/2 as much wheat as it takes to feed a person.   How many additional birds do you need?  How much additional land do you need ... don't forget to feed both the additional birds and the dog.
6)You use your dog to help you find birds.  You can find 3 birds in the Spring, 6 birds in the Summer, 12 birds in the fall, and no birds in the Winter.  How does this information affect your calculation above?


Imagine that you are a ruler in ancient Babylonia.  It is your job to store and distribute grain to your various subjects and to say who can stay in the kingdom.  In the spring you would have to give each subject enough grain to plant their fields.  

Let's say that you know that you have 25,000 square paces of land, farmed by 100 subjects, but you don't know how much each subject farms.  Because you don't want to end up deposed like the previous ruler you decide to keep track of the seed that you give out and the seed that comes back in.  You find out that the previous king gave out 300 jars of seed to the farmers.  You think this is easy, you will give each farmer 3 jars of seeds and everything will work out fine.  Instead what happens is that 50 of the farmers come back to you for more seed because you didn't give them enough.

If you don't give your subjects enough grain they will come back and ask for more, but they will turn any extra grain that you give them into bread.  This wouldn't be too bad, except that every seven years or so there is a drought and the fields don't produce enough grain to feed the farmers for the coming year.  If you have extra grain in your granary to keep your subjects fed during the drought years they will think you're a wise king.  If you don't have any extra grain your subjects may try to depose you and find a new king, so its in your best interest to store as much grain as you can.</text>

== '''EXECUTIVE SUMMARY''' ==

=== INTRODUCTION ===

If saving money is a priority for your K-12 institution, you should review and analyze “cloud computing” alternatives as a potential next step for your technology department.  Usage of “cloud computing” resources and capabilities is rising most rapidly among colleges and universities, but thousands of K-12 educational institutions — as well as hundreds of non-profits and dozens of municipal, state and Federal government entities — have already made, or will soon make, the move to the “cloud.”  If you choose to switch to cloud computing, it’s likely that your job and your department’s responsibilities will change dramatically.

=== '''CHAPTER FORMAT''' ===

''This Chapter Presented in an Exceptional Format for This Wikibook Due to Importance of Subject'' - Both 1) an executive summary and 2) a longer, detailed discussion of cloud computing will be presented.  The initial summary contains links to additional relevant information in the following detailed section should you wish to enhance and enrich your understanding of a given facet or factor presented.   In 2009 and beyond, we believe we should provide access to an above-average amount of information on something that may change your job as profoundly as cloud computing very potentially will.  This chapter format, however, makes the review of more in-depth critical thinking overtly discretionary — offering an easily skimmed summary of key cloud computing facts and issues if your time is tightly constrained.  Indeed, an even greater distillation of this chapter can be gleaned solely from the clickable box of headers above, a true birds-eye view if you're flying very quickly.  Of note to frequent flyers, however, our more detailed “how-to” counsel primarily resides, by necessity, in the lower &quot;detailed discussion&quot; sections.

''Bold and Italicized Font Indicate Summaries and Signposts'' - Bolded questions and italicized condensations of answers and other relevant perspectives are provided as telegraphic signposts for skimmers on the fly.

=== '''WHO SHOULD READ WHAT LEVEL OF DETAIL''' ===

==== A Version for Each Reader  ==== 

* ''Tier 1'' - Those who are simply interested in the issue of cloud computing can garner a good deal of preliminary information by simply reading the clickable box of blue headers (clicking any of interest, of course).

* ''Tier 2'' - Those who are considering cloud computing for their K-12 institution, but haven't set any timetable for the process of vendor review and analysis will acquire a good background of knowledge by skimming or reading the Executive Summary preceding the detailed discussion.

* ''Tier 3'' - Those who are actively considering cloud computing as a near- or medium-term option for their K-12 institution should reference whatever detailed discussion seems appropriate to your selection process.  We may well offer solutions to problems you haven't yet thought of.

=== '''WHAT IS “CLOUD COMPUTING” (abbreviated “CC” often below)?''' ===

==== '''Definition of CC as Shared Web-Sourced Computing and Storage on Demand''' ====

''Where One Stands on CC Often Depends on Where One Sits''  - One can find numerous definitions of “cloud computing” so it’s important to define what you mean in any conversations with non-technology staff.  “Experts” tend to define CC in ways most meaningful or useful to them or their companies.

''Everything Old is New Again'' - As with other so-called Internet &quot;revolutions,” many aspects of CC consist of “old,” existing technologies used together in new ways.   In aggregate, however, CC is truly, as Wikipedia states, a “paradigm shift” that is an important factor contributing to an increasingly mobile Web 2.0 computing environment and user base. 

''Essential Characteristics of CC'' - The current consensus definition of Wikipedia editors in late 2009 is that [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing cloud computing] is “Internet-based computing, whereby shared resources, software and information are provided to computers and other devices on-demand, like the electricity grid.”

The essential elements of this Wikipedia definition are:

* ''Web Locus'' - Browsers access a “cloud” located “virtually” in the global Internet or World Wide Web.
  
* ''Resource Pooling'' - Provision of “shared” resources, software and information, often from multiple locations to multiple consumers. 
 
* ''Broad Network Access'' - Capabilities are available over a network accessible with a range of mobile “devices.”
 
* ''Highly Flexible Levels of Consumption'' - The user manages consumption of products and services “on demand,” whether scaling up or scaling down.

* ''Metered Usage'' - The provision of cloud computing products and services should be able to be finely measured and reported, especially for any billing.

==== Selected CC Service Models Range from Software to Platform to Infrastructure as a Service====
 
In past years, Wikipedia and others have cited three, somewhat overlapping service models as part of definitions for cloud computing.  These are:

* ''Software as a Service (SaaS)'' – The consumer runs easily accessible applications on the cloud, usually without any control of the infrastructure.

* ''Platform as a Service (PaaS)'' – Consumer-created, proprietary or customized applications are supported by the cloud computing provider in the cloud, but the consumer still has no control over the underlying cloud infrastructure.

* ''Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)'' – The consumer may manage provision of fundamental computing resources including storage, processing and networks.  The provision of computing power is occasionally considered separately from data storage and termed “Computing as a Service” (CaaS). 

* ''Other Terms Describing Cloud Computing'' – Other commonly used phrases that might help you explain cloud computing to less knowledgeable students or teachers at your school include “IT as a service” or “Desktop as a service.”

More descriptive details are included in the [[K-12_School_Computer_Networking/Chapter_35/Cloud_Computing#DETAILED_DISCUSSION_OF_.22WHAT_IS_CLOUD_COMPUTING.3F.22|detailed discussion of “What is CC?”]] below.

=== HOW DO K-12 SCHOOLS MOST OFTEN USE CC? ===

==== Storage and Applications Primary CC Capabilities Sought ====

As stated in [[K-12_School_Computer_Networking/Chapter_30|Chapter 30]] and [[K-12_School_Computer_Networking/Chapter_33|Chapter 33]] of this Wikibook, data hosting and Web-based software applications are the two capabilities most commonly sought by K-12 technology coordinators considering a switch to cloud computing.

==== Email and Collaboration Are Top CC Applications ==== 

When evaluating cloud computing as an option, applications that 1) provide a cloud-based email function or 2) enhance online collaboration are typically the top priority of most K-12 school technology coordinators.  Beyond basic software applications, many are now attracted to cloud computing applications that facilitate creativity and collaboration among a range of client users.

=== WHY DO K-12 SCHOOLS CHOOSE TO SWITCH TO CC? === 

==== K-12 Institutions Save Money and Time, While Enhancing User Collaboration ====

The top two reasons why cited by K-12 technology staff as rationale for switching to CC are 1) cost savings and 2) reduced staff labor hours.  Key facets of these important benefits, plus the potential added advantage of increased user collaboration are as follows:

* ''Substantial Technology Budget Savings Desired'' - Currently, K-12 institutions can secure a large amount of CC data storage and many sophisticated Internet-based applications at no or low cost. More information on CC providers is [[K-12_School_Computer_Networking/Chapter_35/Cloud_Computing#WHAT_CC_PROVIDERS_DO_SCHOOLS_USE_MOST_OFTEN.3F|presented below]] .

:''Examples of K-12 Scenarios Where CC Should Be Considered'' - Scenarios that might prompt you to consider cloud computing are those in which 1) finding new ways to save money is a high priority for your department, as it is for many schools in a period characterized by technology budget pressure and cuts or 2) your computing needs are up-and-down, hard-to-predict or expanding, potentially forcing upfront investment in capacity that’s either infrequently used or only eventually needed in the future.

* ''Reductions in Staff Time Spent on Maintenance and Support Valued'' – Most technology departments at educational institutions experience significant reductions in staff labor hours necessary for ongoing infrastructure maintenance after moving to CC.   In addition, many have also reported declines in staff time needed for user support after an initial labor-intensive transition period of several weeks. 

:''Use of Surplus Time Produced by CC is Discretionary'' - Some switchers state this freed-up technology staff time is now being invested in achieving better integration of technology to help meet classroom educational goals.  You know best what you would do with the extra time almost always afforded by CC.

:''Long-term Reduction in Overall Staff Labor Hours Possible'' – A switch to CC might make it possible to cut staff or duties from your department.  Be aware, though, that moving to CC also yields a host of new responsibilities, so do not move too quickly.  As discussed below, many create a special CC-focused full-time or part-time position.

* ''Enhanced User Collaboration Also Seen to be Beneficial'' - Faculty, staff and students at your K-12 school or schools clearly may benefit from expanded opportunities for online collaboration available via CC.

The potential [[K-12_School_Computer_Networking/Chapter_35/Cloud_Computing#DETAILED_DISCUSSION_OF_.E2.80.9CWHAT_ARE_THE_POTENTIAL_BENEFITS_OF_CC.3F.E2.80.9D|benefits]] — as well as [[K-12_School_Computer_Networking/Chapter_35/Cloud_Computing#DETAILED_DISCUSSION_OF_.E2.80.9CWHAT_ARE_THE_POTENTIAL_CONCERNS_ABOUT_CC.3F.E2.80.9D|concerns]] with — cloud computing are discussed in much more detail below

=== HOW FAST IS CC GROWING IN GENERAL? ===

==== Overall CC Growth is Dramatic ====

''CC Category Revenue Seen Tripling by 2013''  – Most experts believe that revenue from CC will at least triple from 2010 to 2013 to more than $150 billion in aggregate.  

''CC Category Bigger Than Microsoft or Apple'' – For perspective, the most conservative projection for future CC annual revenue exceeds that for America’s second- and third-largest corporations: Apple and Microsoft, respectively.

More details on CC growth are [[K-12_School_Computer_Networking/Chapter_35/Cloud_Computing#DETAILED_DISCUSSION_OF_.E2.80.9CHOW_FAST_IS_CC_GROWING_IN_GENERAL.3F.E2.80.9D|provided below]].

=== HOW FAST IS CC GROWING FOR EDUCATION SPECIFICALLY? ===

==== Spurred by Email Outsourcing, Growth Also Dramatic Among Educational Institutions ==== 

''Cloud Computing Even Hotter Trend for Educational Institutions'' – Evidence of a trend towards CC among K-12 institutions is, at present, plentiful — but only anecdotal.  Among colleges and universities, however, reliable broad-scale surveys have revealed a  boom in CC since 2008, especially for email.  Similar technology trends for K-12 institutions often lag, but roughly follow, those in higher education.  We expect the K-12 trend towards cloud computing will rapidly accelerate.  

''Over Half of Total College/University Student and Faculty Email Likely Now Outsourced'' – The most recent published results of the trusted annual Campus Computing Report of college and university technology directors (effectively data from early 2009) were as follows:

* About two-fifths (42.4%) of those surveyed “had migrated,” or “were about to migrate” to an “outsourced student email service.”

* An additional three in ten (28.3%) were reviewing outsourcing options for students during the 2008-2009 academic year.

* Less than a fifth (14.8%) of institutions had migrated to outsourced email for faculty by mid-2008, however, but many were considering doing so in the near future.

Thus, the estimated percentage of colleges and universities outsourcing email and other functions in 2010 is likely over 75%.  Based on institutional size, the proportion of total college and university users — including faculty, students and staff — who likely now employ outsourced email capabilities is even higher as you read this. 

''K-12 Schools Currently at Lower Levels, But Rising Extremely Rapidly'' - Among K-12 institutions, there is no source of data as broad-based and reliable as the Campus Computing Report for colleges and universities.  Evidence for growth does exist in a wide number of varied sources, notably 1) online articles or announcements by public K-12 school districts (some among the largest in the country); 2) similar articles and announcements from individual schools or 3) Google or MS testimonials or case studies from K-12 institutions.  The current level of CC usage among K-12 institutions appears to be lower than that for colleges and universities, but expanding at comparably dramatic levels. 

Anecdotal data strongly supports a general statement by Google that Google Apps for Education is now being used by millions of K-12 students and faculty and thousands of K-12 institutions — and Microsoft's Live@edu could almost certainly make the same statement.

More details on the remarkable growth of CC, including interesting additional survey data, are [[K-12_School_Computer_Networking/Chapter_35/Cloud_Computing#DETAILED_DISCUSSION_OF_.E2.80.9CHOW_FAST_IS_CC_GROWING_FOR_EDUCATION.3F.E2.80.9D|provided below]].

=== '''WHAT CC PROVIDERS DO SCHOOLS USE MOST OFTEN?''' ===

==== Google and Microsoft Dominate CC for Education Clients ====

As noted, K-12 trends tend to lag, but roughly follow, the following trends in colleges and universities:

* ''Google and Microsoft Supply 95% of CC for All Schools''   – With free offerings, Google and Microsoft dominate the education market. Projections of the annual College Survey above indicate that Google and Microsoft together very probably now account for over 95% of CC usage among educational institutions, with open-source Zimbra serving over 4% of the rest.  (Zimbra received little mention from K-12 users, but it, and other potential resources, are viable options that should be considered.) 

*''A Majority of Colleges and Universities Use Google'' – In 2008, the Campus Computing Survey found that a majority of colleges and universities outsourcing student email had opted for Google (56.5%), while two-fifths (38.4%) used Microsoft and 4.8 % used Zimbra. These proportions persisted through 2009, with Google edging higher. 

''Proposed Teachers College (TC) Contract Google Apps for Education Provides Insight'' – The public April 2010 recommendation by Teachers College Academic Computing Department to switch all faculty, staff and students to the Google cloud will be an informative case study for this chapter.  Much of this discussion will be presented in the detailed section below.

Other details, including interesting additional survey data, are also [[K-12_School_Computer_Networking/Chapter_35/Cloud_Computing#DETAILED_DISCUSSION_OF_.E2.80.9CWHAT_CC_PROVIDERS_DO_SCHOOLS_USE_MOST_OFTEN.3F.E2.80.9D|provided below]].

=== WHAT CC OPTIONS SHOULD K-12 INSTITUTIONS CONSIDER? ===

=== Free Google Apps for Education and Microsoft Live@Edu Used Most By K-12 Institutions, but Other Options Exist === 

''Google, Microsoft and Zimbra Are The Top Three'' - Google (with Google Apps for Education), Microsoft (with Live@Eu) and Zimbra all now offer a suite of products and services at no charge to all accredited K-12 educational institutions.  Google and Microsoft, in particular, are hotly competitive in the K-12 education market. 

''Don’t Settle Without Reviewing Options!'' - If you are considering switching to the cloud to save time and money, you should keep checking for updated offerings since new features are being added almost monthly.   Other CC options available through either larger (e.g. [http://www.redhat.com/solutions/education/ Red Hat Solutions for Education] and [http://aws.amazon.com/education Amazon Web Services in Education]) or smaller vendors (any online search will yield numerous candidates) should also be considered in any comprehensive forward-planning review you conduct for your K-12 institution. These options are growing and changing almost daily.

''Consider Open Source Options to Reduce Your Dependence on Private Companies'' – Open source options are really the only way to be free of the potential whims of a private company.  You could start your strategic review at sites like [http://www.schoolforge.net/ schoolforge.net], [http://www.eduforge.org/ eduforge.org] or [http://www.osalt.com/ osalt.com].  You could also join helpful discussion groups, such as the [http://members.opensource.org/mailman/listinfo/osi-edu-discuss Open Source Initiative Education Project]. 

All of these alternatives are [[K-12_School_Computer_Networking/Chapter_35/Cloud_Computing#DETAILED_DISCUSSION_OF_.E2.80.9CWHAT_CC_OPTIONS_SHOULD_K-12_INSTITUTIONS_CONSIDER.3F.E2.80.9D|discussed below]] in very extensive detail, including a detailed section on the reasons why vendors are offering schools free CC resources.

=== [These issues are discussed in [[K-12_School_Computer_Networking/Chapter_35/Cloud_Computing#DETAILED_DISCUSSION_OF_.E2.80.9CWHAT_ARE_THE_POTENTIAL_BENEFITS_OF_CC.3F.E2.80.9D|much more detail below.]]] ===

==== Easy Scalability ====

The fact that you consume only what you need, classic “pay-as-you-go” metered usage, means that you maximize dollar efficiency as you're scaling up and down .  Formerly necessary upfront investments in hardware or software for eventual or possible needs are not needed anymore, minimizing overall investment. Any changes in your CC network can made with less time, trouble and money required.

==== More Flexibility ====

Upgrades of software and hardware tend to be much cheaper.  Thus, there is a heightened ability to experiment with various options.  Any decision can be reversed relatively easily if dissatisfied.  CC systems can typically accommodate multiple document formats.  Documents are much more accessible in cloud, dramatically reducing the need to store anything locally.

==== Increased Mobility ====

Multiple devices can now access the cloud, including not only laptops and home users, but netbooks and mobile phone browsers — including higher end “smartphones” or “app phones — and other devices.  Computing is made far more mobile.

==== Less Maintenance and Support ==== 

Those that switch to the cloud almost always experience a substantial drop in staff time for maintenance (reportedly now a majority of dedicated staff labor hours for most K-12 institutions).  One factor contributing to lowered maintenance is elimination of the need to install or service applications individually.  Many report less time needed for ongoing user support after an initial transition period of several weeks (the transition time is usually much less than feared).  Some have reported that they now can spend this surplus time on integration of technology, but obviously that choice would be yours.

==== Lower Costs ==== 

All of the above factors will likely have positive effects on your costs.  Put simply, by doing more with much less “on the ground,” the utility computing approach slashes need for investment.  Separate analyses we did each showed total direct and indirect savings can be conservatively estimated at roughly $50 per user per year or $200 per computer with an average user ratio (the bases for these estimates are discussed at length below).  Another factor in decreased costs is that cloud computing vendors’ economies of scale yield customer savings.

==== Other Potential Benefits Include Security and Reliability ====

Cloud computing may well offer better security and reliability than your current school computing network.  Because there are also concerns with each of these factors, however, both the pluses and minuses will be discussed below in the “What Are the Potential Concerns with CC?” section.

=== WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL CONCERNS ABOUT CC? === 

=== [Many more “how-to” tips on addressing concerns included in [[K-12_School_Computer_Networking/Chapter_35/Cloud_Computing#DETAILED_DISCUSSION_OF_.E2.80.9CWHAT_ARE_THE_POTENTIAL_CONCERNS_ABOUT_CC.3F.E2.80.9D|detailed discussion below]].] ===

==== Security ==== 

Security and privacy are the most common concerns with CC.  In diagnosing your security vulnerabilities, it is important to assess the relative weight of your various different security priorities, whether it be operational and organizational security; general physical security, including ensuring the integrity of the server; security of applications; or protection from threats from hackers or unauthorized users.  When you move your data to the cloud, you are relinquishing much of your control over security features. 

On the other hand, the cloud computing vendor may be able to employ more sophisticated and up-to-date security measures than you can, especially the larger ones who can spread enhanced security costs and staff over a larger user base.  They may also be able to move more quickly to find solutions to the ever-changing array of security risks, devoting greater resources than you can afford with your much smaller staffing and budgets.  The nature of the cloud also enables security updates to be put in place as soon as they are developed, an especially important factor when dealing with a substantial and newly emerging threat. 

The following issues related to security are [[K-12_School_Computer_Networking/Chapter_35/Cloud_Computing#Detailed_Discussion_of_Security|discussed in much more detail below]]: 1) centralization vs. de-centralization 2) security of server/storage locations; 3) issues with multi-tenancy; and 4) the fact that the highest vulnerability is typically at the local level.

To start to gauge your security risks, ask if the CC vendor has passed a standard “SAS 70” security audit.  Be aware that full and transparent CC vendor reporting to you is essential to security.  Because these reports may be too voluminous or detailed to screen by yourself, you may want to consider engaging one of the fast-increasing number of providers of cloud monitoring services.

One of the most important factors promoting private vendor consciousness of security - as well as privacy, compliance, and, to some degree, all of the concerns below - is that the vendor knows well 1) that their reputation depends on maintaining the highest standards and 2) that their reputation is the rock on which all future business success must be built.

==== Privacy ====

Privacy and security are so inter-related that many of the issues directly or indirectly relevant to privacy are touched upon above in the “Security” section, as well as in sections like &quot;Compliance&quot; below.  Multi-tenancy is a potential privacy threat that can be largely addressed by good vendor reporting. 

Because of the Google hacking incident in China, many people wrongly have sizeable concerns about data requests from foreign governments to servers situated internationally. The simple fact that those security breaches were hacks by unknown individuals versus anything formally approved and organized by the Chinese government efforts is sometimes forgotten.  Foreign governments are very unlikely to request data housed for another country’s educational institutions by a private multinational CC vendor.  Even if they did request it, Google and any other CC vendor would adamantly refuse to surrender it, citing overwhelming legal precedent.  In rare cases, such as that of a homicide in which meaningful information could be proven to be held by a CC vendor, there might be discussions as to whether limited evidence might be disclosed. 
 
U.S. K-12 institutions should be more concerned about data requests from U.S. governmental entities.  U.S. Federal and state law clearly does provide extensive privacy protections to individual students and schools, but cases like the National Security Agency’s (NSA) successful request for phone data on suspected terrorists or their accomplices illustrate that the prevention of possible, but uncertain, future negative events may be considered the basis for data requests from the U.S. government.  This is a slippery slope, but we’ve yet to slide down very far.

==== Advertising ====

The issue of receiving unwanted advertising concerns many who consider Google Apps for Education or Microsoft Live@Edu. Both Google and Microsoft set clear contractual limits. Unlike Gmail, Google states that it will not serve any advertising to anyone but alumni who still use the school’s Google account.  Microsoft states that it will not serve any “third-party” advertising, but opens the door to advertising Microsoft’s own products and services to school users.

==== Compliance ==== 

Both Google and Microsoft, as well as other vendors, assure compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).  In general, privacy and compliance are linked and there will always be issues, even if breaches are due to vendor or user “mistakes” alone.

==== Portability ====

Future data portability is critical to ensure, but inexplicably often ignored or dismissed.  Portability is part of the larger issue of the importance of an exit strategy.  Before entering any contract, especially with a smaller vendor who may be more likely to store data in their own idiosyncratic format, it important to make formal provisions that ensure future data portability.

==== Recovery ====

Your ability to recover may be enhanced by CC, but concerns remain.  It is paramount that any new CC functions be incorporated into an updated disaster recovery plan should you make the switch. Unlike business, Recovery Point Objective (RPO) may be more important to your K-12 institution than Recovery Time Objective (RTO), but your priorities need to decided upon. Google and Microsoft have contractual parameters for recovery which should be reviewed for acceptability if you are considering choosing either Apps for Education or Live@Edu.

==== Assessment of All Costs (including Hidden and Indirect Costs) ====
 
While calculation of the Total Cost of Ownership of your current K-12 school network is critical for determining cost savings achievable by switching to the cloud, calculation of the potential costs of a CC system are just as important in determining whether such a move makes sense financially.  The lowered costs of upgrades, maintenance and support in dollars and staff time are obvious estimates to make.  Indirect costs are harder to estimate, but they must be identified and approximated if you are to present an accurate financial picture for options and ultimate recommendations.

Separately, K-12 technology coordinators who engage billed CC services must understand exactly “how they are billed for what” before signing any cloud computing contract.   Usage of all cloud computing resources must be measured with accuracy.  Billing for CC usage, whether for applications, data storage or any other product or service, should be reported on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.  Whether working with smaller private CC vendor or a large &quot;free&quot; vendor  special staff function and, potentially, a monitoring service should be designated to help you stay on top of necessary tracking. 

Should you decide to join the many who are switching to the cloud, the effort you put into preparing in advance for the new direct and indirect effects of a CC network on your department's functioning will yield many positive results — making the short-term transition smoother and your long-term job more satisfying.

== '''DETAILED DISCUSSION OF CLOUD COMPUTING''' ==

=== DETAILED DISCUSSION OF &quot;WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING?&quot; ===

==== Detailed Discussion of Definition of Cloud Computing ==== 

''Where One Stands on Cloud Computing Often Depends on Where One Sits''  - On the Internet, in print and other media, one can find numerous definitions of “cloud computing” that vary in small or more significant ways, so it’s important to define what you mean in any conversations with non-technology staff.  As with other umbrella terms widely used online, such as “Web 2.0,” “experts” tend to define “cloud computing” in ways most meaningful or useful to them or their companies. 

''Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing''  - The current [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%20Cloud_computing Wikipedia definition] in early 2010 is that cloud computing is “Internet-based computing, whereby shared resources, software and information are provided to computers and other devices on-demand, like the electricity grid.”  The essential elements of this definition are:

* ''Web Locus'' - Identification of the global “Internet” or World Wide Web as the locus of cloud computing.  Web browsers are the means to access the cloud.  

* ''Resource Pooling'' - Provision of “shared” resources, software and information, often from multiple locations to multiple consumers.  Examples of pooled resources include storage, processing, memory and network bandwidth

* ''Broad Network Access'' – Capabilities are available over a cloud computing network accessible with a range of mobile “devices,” including laptops, smartphones and PDAs in addition to desktops. 

* ''Highly Flexible Levels of Consumption'' - The user-managed consumption of products and services “on demand.”  Cloud computing offers users rapid elasticity in consumption, whether scaling up or scaling down.

* ''Metered Usage'' - The last parenthetical reference to “the electricity grid” in the Wikipedia definition is a layman-friendly analogy illustrating the metered usage that characterizes cloud computing. The provision of cloud computing products and services (storage, processing or bandwidth, for example) should be able to be finely controlled, monitored, measured and reported in a transparent manner, especially for any billing tied to consumption.

''What’s Old is Sometimes New Again'' - The segment’s growing popularity has also prompted some vendors to newly rename products and services they’ve long offered as trendy “cloud computing,” a phenomenon dubbed “cloud-washing” by Forrester Research.   Anyone using Hotmail in the years since 1997 or Gmail since 2004, for example, has essentially been using cloud computing capability.  In fact, the first successful demo of software for a cloud-based “[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmail Webmail]” occurred in 1995.

==== Detailed Discussion of Service Models for Cloud Computing ==== 

In past years, Wikipedia and others have cited three, somewhat overlapping service models as part of definitions for cloud computing.  These are:

* ''Software as a Service (SaaS)'' – The consumer runs easily accessible applications on the cloud, usually without any control of the underlying infrastructure or even individual application capabilities except for limited user-specific configuration settings.

* ''Platform as a Service (PaaS)'' – Consumer-created, proprietary or customized applications are supported by the cloud computing provider in the cloud.  The consumer thus may manage deployment of applications and, potentially, configurations of the applications’ hosting environment, but still has no control over the underlying cloud infrastructure (e.g., servers, operating systems or storage).

* ''Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)'' – In this service mode, the consumer may manage provision of fundamental computing resources including storage, processing and networks.  The provision of computing power is occasionally considered separately from data storage and termed “Computing as a Service” (CaaS).  Some IaaS cloud computing vendors will allow the consumer to deploy and run client-specific, customized software including operating systems and applications.  The consumer thus may control operating systems, storage and, possibly, select limited network components like host firewalls in addition to deployed applications.

''Other Terms Describing Cloud Computing'' – Other commonly used phrases that might help you explain cloud computing to less knowledgeable students or teachers at your school include “IT as a service” or “Desktop as a service.”

''Not a Cloud in the Sky'' – Graphic depictions of cloud computing for laymen typically use a visual of amorphous “virtual cloud” floating in the sky.  The “cloud” is actually a graphic often used in network diagrams as a symbol for whatever’s connected externally, but depicting a “cloud in the sky” may mislead those less knowledgeable. The reality is that, while it may be accessed &quot;over the air,&quot; your data will be located on computers or a physical server (or servers) in a data center (or centers) somewhere on Earth's surface.  This fact helps explain why many of the concerns associated with cloud computing are those that would result from any outsourced physical storage and processing.

=== DETAILED DISCUSSION OF “HOW DO K-12 SCHOOLS MOST OFTEN USE CC?” ===

 
==== Storage and Applications Primary Cloud Computing Capabilities Sought ==== 
  
As noted above, [[K-12_School_Computer_Networking/Chapter_30|Chapter 30]] and [[K-12_School_Computer_Networking/Chapter_33|Chapter 33]] cite data hosting and Web-based software applications are the two capabilities most commonly sought by K-12 technology coordinators considering a switch to cloud computing.

==== Email and Collaboration Primary Cloud Computing Functions Sought ====

When evaluating cloud computing as an option, a cloud-based email function is the top priority of most K-12 school technology coordinators.  Beyond basic software applications, many are now attracted to cloud computing applications that facilitate creativity and collaboration among a range of client users.

=== DETAILED DISCUSSION OF “WHY DO K-12 SCHOOLS CHOOSE CC?” === 

==== K-12 Institutions Save Money and Time, While Enhancing Collaboration ====

This presents typical goals cited by K-12 technology staff as rationale for switching to cloud computing.  The [[K-12_School_Computer_Networking/Chapter_35/Cloud_Computing#DETAILED_DISCUSSION_OF_.E2.80.9CWHAT_ARE_THE_POTENTIAL_BENEFITS_OF_CC.3F.E2.80.9D|potential benefits of]] – as well as [[K-12_School_Computer_Networking/Chapter_35/Cloud_Computing#DETAILED_DISCUSSION_OF_.E2.80.9CWHAT_ARE_THE_POTENTIAL_CONCERNS_ABOUT_CC.3F.E2.80.9D|concerns with]]  — cloud computing are discussed in more detail below.

''Substantial Technology Budget Savings Desired'' - Cost saving is most often cited as a reason to consider cloud computing alternatives.  Currently, K-12 institutions can secure a large amount of cloud computing data storage and many sophisticated Internet-based applications at no cost.  Examples of scenarios that might prompt you to consider cloud computing in your next forward planning or strategic review of resources and capabilities include those in which:

* Finding new ways to save money is a high priority for your department, as it is for many schools in a period characterized by technology budget pressure and cuts.

* Your computing needs are up-and-down, hard-to-predict or expanding, potentially forcing upfront investment in larger-than-ongoing-average capacity that’s either infrequently used or only eventually needed in the future.

''Reductions in Staff Time Spent on Maintenance and Support Valued'' – After moving functions from a local network to the cloud, most technology departments at educational institutions experience significant reductions in staff labor hours necessary for ongoing infrastructure maintenance, of course, but many have also reported declines in staff time needed for user support after an initial transition period.  Some switchers state this freed-up technology staff time is now being invested in achieving better integration of technology to help meet educational goals.  Some schools initially thought that cloud computing would enable them to cut back on systems administration staff overall, but many found it wiser to create new cloud administrator-type position or positions.

''Enhanced User Collaboration Seen to be Beneficial'' - Faculty, staff and students at your K-12 school or schools may benefit from expanded opportunities for online collaboration available via cloud computing products and services.

=== DETAILED DISCUSSION OF “HOW FAST IS CC GROWING IN GENERAL?” ===

==== Overall Cloud Computing Expected to Triple by 2013 ====

''One of “Hottest Topics” in Information Technology'' – Especially since early 2009, cloud computing has often been described as one of the hottest topics in IT.   One piece of informal evidence of cloud computing's current salience is that a search of the phrase “hottest topic” with “cloud computing” and “IT” on any search engine yields dozens of hits.   

''Cloud Computing Category Estimated to Triple by 2013'' – One common way to measure the size and growth of any business sector is by revenue and its associated rate of increase. While estimates of current and future business levels vary in terms of absolute dollars, there is general agreement that revenue from cloud computing will triple from 2010 to 2013 to up to $150 billion.  

''Cloud Computing Category Bigger Than Microsoft or Apple'' - For perspective, even the lowest projection of 2010 aggregate yearly cloud computing revenue exceeds the aggregate annual revenue for both of America’s second- and third-largest corporations: Apple and Microsoft, respectively, growing ever closer to Exxon Mobil in terms of both annual corporate revenue and market capitalization.

=== DETAILED DISCUSSION OF “HOW FAST IS CC GROWING FOR EDUCATION?” === 

==== Spurred by Email Outsourcing, Growth Dramatic Among Educational Institutions ==== 

''Cloud Computing Even “Hotter” Trend for Educational Institutions'' – Evidence of a trend towards cloud computing among K-12 institutions is, at present, only anecdotal.  Surveys have revealed a marked boom in cloud computing among colleges and universities since 2008, especially for email.  Similar technology trends for K-12 institutions often lag, but roughly follow, those in higher education.  We expect the K-12 trend towards cloud computing will accelerate.  

''Over Half of Email Likely Now Outsourced by Higher-Education Users'' – The Campus Computing Report conducts an annual survey of college and university technology directors.  Statistical calculations show that, given the sample of 500 in a total universe of 4000-plus public and private two- or four-year colleges and universities, the following survey percentage results on 2008 email outsourcing trends are reliable at the 95% confidence interval within +/- 5% for the general population: 

* About two-fifths (42.4%) of surveyed “had migrated,” or “were about to migrate” to an “outsourced student email service.”

* An additional three in ten (28.3%) were reviewing outsourcing options for students during the 2008-2009 academic year.

* Less than a fifth (14.8%) of institutions had migrated to outsourced email for faculty by mid-2008, however, but many were considering doing so in the near future.

Free summaries of any Campus Computing Survey report from 1994–2008 can be [http://www.campuscomputing.net/survey downloaded here].  For $75, the full 2009 report can be [http://www.campuscomputing.net/files/CC2009-OrderForm.pdf ordered in .pdf format here].  Full print copies of any report from 1994–2008 can also be ordered for $35.    

''Majority of Higher Ed Users Likely Now Use Outsourced Email'' - The proportions of outsourced email for faculty and staff very likely jumped in the last two years since that survey was taken.  The percentage of colleges and universities outsourcing email and other functions now is probably closer to 75% than 50%.  Given typical faculty-to-student ratios, it’s safe to say a majority of college and university users now employ outsourced email capabilities.
  
''K-12 Use of Outsourced Capabilities Lower But Expanding Rapidly'' - Among K-12 institutions, there is no source of data as broad-based and reliable as the Campus Computing Report for colleges and universities.  Evidence for growth has been gathered from varied sources, such as 1) online articles or announcements by public K-12 school districts (some among the largest in the country) and individual schools or 2) Google or MS testimonials or case studies from K-12 institutions.  The current level of cloud computing usage among K-12 institutions appears to be lower than that for colleges and universities, but expanding at comparably dramatic levels.  Anecdotal data strongly supports a general statement by Google that Google Apps for Education is now being used by millions of K-12 students and faculty and thousands of K-12 institutions – and Live@edu could almost certainly make the same statement.

=== DETAILED DISCUSSION OF “WHAT CC PROVIDERS DO SCHOOLS USE MOST OFTEN?” === 

==== Google and Microsoft Overwhelmingly Dominate Cloud Computing for Education Clients ====

''Google and Microsoft Are Top Cloud Computing Suppliers for Schools'' – Two companies are the suppliers for practically all of the cloud computing email and collaboration systems for education. With free offerings, Google and Microsoft dominate the education market.  Statistically valid quantitative data on cloud computing providers’ comparative share among educational institutions is only available for higher-education institutions, but K-12 trends tend to lag, but follow, these kinds of trends in technology for education.  Conservative projections of the respected, large-scale annual Campus Computing Survey indicate that Google and Microsoft very probably now account for over 95% of cloud computing among educational institutions together in 2010, with open-source Zimbra serving over 4% of the rest.  

''Most Common Reasons Why for Google and Microsoft'' - When choosing between Google and Microsoft for a given school, senior spokespeople usually mention.  Those who choose Google Apps for Education most frequently say that Gmail is already being used by most of the students so its popularity with a large number of users is proven.  Those who choose Microsoft Live@edu tend to point to the fact that the school already uses Microsoft’s products and services, such as MS Exchange, and that MS software is most familiar to faculty and staff — both factors easing the transition in their eyes.   Testimonials from those who’ve made the switch indicate the transitions from any system to Google Apps for Education and MS Live@edu is almost always quick and easy.  As discussed below, K-12 technology directors should far more factors than ease of transition in assessing next steps

''A Majority of Colleges and Universities Use Google'' – In 2008, the Campus Computing Survey found that a majority of colleges and universities outsourcing student email had opted for Google (56.5%), while two-fifths (38.4%) used Microsoft and 4.8 % used Zimbra.  Less than 0.5% thus used any other cloud computing vendor. These proportions persisted through 2009, with Google edging higher.  

''Market Share by Type of Institution Also Shows Google Dominance'' – Slides of select data from the 2009 Campus Computing Survey (CCS) are viewable in a video of a presentation by the CCS director posted on the 2009 EDUCAUSE Conference [http://www.educause.edu/E09+Hybrid/%20EDUCAUSE2009FacetoFace%20Conferen/The2009CampusComputingSurvey/176028 website]  .  These slides show that Google’s relative share of outsourced email at private research universities and four-year colleges neared two-thirds of the total market.  Microsoft remained strongest at public research and four-year institutions, with over one-third of the outsourced email market.  Two-year community colleges were the only category that favored Microsoft (55% versus 40% for Google).  Zimbra’s share of market was generally a low single-digit market percentage, only registering as high as 8% at public research universities last year. 

''Proposed Teachers College (TC) Contract Google Apps for Education Provides Insight'' – The public April 2010 recommendation by Teachers College Academic Computing Department to switch all faculty, staff and students to the Google cloud will be an informative case study for this chapter.  We will be able to provide you with agreed-upon details of what appears to be a typical Google Apps for Education contract, as well as the rationale offered for the TC technology department’s proposal.

=== DETAILED DISCUSSION OF “WHAT CC OPTIONS SHOULD K-12 INSTITUTIONS CONSIDER?” ===

Google, Microsoft and Zimbra all now offer a suite of products and services at no charge to all accredited K-12 educational institutions.  Google and Microsoft, in particular, are hotly competitive in the K-12 education market.  If you are considering switching to the cloud to save time and money, you should keep checking for updated offerings since new features are being added almost monthly.   

Other cloud computing options available through smaller vendors or open source applications should also be considered in any comprehensive forward-planning review you conduct for your K-12 institution. These options are growing and changing almost daily.  All of these alternatives are discussed below.  

==== Free Products and Services Provided by Google, Microsoft and Zimbra ==== 

''Extensive Free Packages Offered to K-12 Institutions''  – A summary of each vendor’s cloud-based products and service follows, with further discussion of benefits and concerns continuing below. The resources and capabilities you can get free may well be satisfactory for your K-12 institution without any paid add-ons.  Incremental services such as 1) more extensive archiving and discovery (needed for more rigorous compliance) and 2) extra security features may be purchased on a discounted, per-user basis (though Google currently offers a full security package free to K-12 institutions only).

* ''Google'' - [http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/edu/k12.html Google Apps for Education for K-12 schools] includes Google’s Gmail, Docs, Sites, Groups, Talk and Video, all free for K-12 institutions.  Extra security features now free for K-12 Google clients cost up to $15 per user for higher-education institutions, non-profits and government entities, but this offer for free extra security may not last beyond 2010.  The pending TC contract for Google Apps for Education specifies TC’s 1) full ownership of all data with privacy guarantees that are well beyond FERPA specifications, 2) full control of all accounts and feature selection and 3) school-specific email addresses (jdewey@tc.columbia.edu, for example, not jdewey@gmail.com).  Very importantly, Google guarantees no advertisements or data mining for life of any contract with an educational institution.

* ''Microsoft'' – [http://www.microsoft.com/liveatedu/liveatedu-for-primary-education.aspx?locale=en-US&amp;country=US Microsoft Live@edu for K-12 schools] offers “co-branded” Exchange email and calendar functions at no cost.  Microsoft’s Live@edu collaborative products and services for K-12 students and faculty include MS Office Live Workspace, Windows Live Skydrive and Windows Live Spaces.  Microsoft (MS) offers IM capabilities with its Windows Live Messenger; MS also touts its Windows Live Writer as an easy way to compose blog posts, whether on Live Spaces or an existing class blog.   MS policy on ads or data mining and we don’t have access to a pending contract like we do for Google and Teachers College; it’s quite probable that that MS matches these features of Google’s privacy policy for educational clients, however.  To compete even more effectively with Google Docs, it’s rumored that MS may soon offer pared-down versions of MS Office software like PowerPoint, Word and Excel to Live@edu clients.  In another major competitive move in 2010, Microsoft announced a “strategic technical collaboration agreement” with ePals, a trusted provider of Web 2.0 platforms (and “safe, secure email”) to K-12 institutions. 
 
* ''Zimbra'' – [http://www.zimbra.com/ Zimbra’s Collaboration Server 6.0 Open Source Edition] provides software for email, group calendar, contacts, instant messaging, file storage and web document management.  Zimbra is not a cloud computing company, but Zimbra integrates easily with any existing cloud-based systems including those offered by VMware, its new owner.  Open Source Initiative does not recognize Zimbra as possessing a true open source license because 1) a small portion of its code is evidently now proprietary and 2) Yahoo! released the last few Zimbra versions under its Yahoo! Public Initiative rather than meet the more rigid requirements of the [http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd Open Source Initiative].   Zimbra was founded in 2005, primarily as an open source, downloadable email and collaboration suite for small business that was in many ways comparable to, and able to be integrated with, Microsoft Exchange.  Zimbra was an early Web 2.0 hit known particularly for the ease of its calendaring mashups. Yahoo! acquired the company for $350 million in 2007.  After introducing a paid Network Edition with considerably more features than its open source version, Zimbra trumpeted its rise to “50 million paid mailboxes.”   In January 2010, VMware acquired the company at a price reportedly much less than Yahoo! paid three years before.  VMware’s vSphere cloud infrastructure will complement Zimbra’s free products and services for educational users at discounted prices.  (On the other hand, Zimbra has ramped up its efforts to “upsell” its clients to more feature-laden Premier and Professional offerings; this may mean that they will be slower to add features to their open source offering.

==== Free or Low-Cost Alternatives to Google, MS or Zimbra ====

''Other Large Cloud Computing Companies'' – A comprehensive review of potential next steps regarding cloud computing for your K-12 institution should not be restricted to Microsoft Live@Edu, Google Apps for Education or VMware’s Zimbra.  Larger providers of cloud capabilities may also offer favorable contracts to K-12 educational clients.  Amazon Web Services (AWS), a major player in the cloud computing industry, has provided several universities with free “grants.” Red Hat, best known as the leading supplier of open source solutions for corporations, has also initiated efforts in the education sector. 

''Smaller Cloud Computing Companies'' –There are hundreds, if not thousands, of other cloud computing vendors and that number is growing every day; some of them may be more suitable for your specific needs.   While none of over a dozen smaller cloud computing vendors approached for this article offered free resources to our medium-sized high school network prototype, most indicated that discounted services could be negotiated.  Negotiated fees for a smaller K-12 institution could run under $1000 per month for a single institution so it’s very likely you would still save a lot versus your existing network with a smaller paid vendor.  Importantly, most small CC contractors also offered the ability to highly customize systems and applications for each individual client to a much greater degree than Google and MS would.  If you have institution-specific idiosyncratic needs, you may conclude that customization and a greater degree of overall control outweigh the “free” offerings offered by the industry giants.   Nothing, of course, is ever truly free.  The discussion below offer our analysis of why the biggest vendors are offering “free” suites of applications to education, i.e., “what’s in it for Google and Microsoft?” The trade-off of large vs. small is yet another issue illuminated by the comprehensive cost analysis and detailed comparison of pluses and minuses that we strongly recommend.

''True Open Source Software Alternatives'' – K-12 technology coordinators should also consider true open source solutions, especially for specific educational needs.  Open source applications would also be able to more customized to the needs of your school, potentially working together with cloud-based capabilities in an integrated overall package.    The fact that Zimbra does meet the Open Source Initiative’s strict requirements should also not deter K-12 technology coordinators from considering the Zimbra alternative to Google and Microsoft.   If you use open source applications, you won’t be dependent on the fluctuating whims and fortunes of a private company.  Public-sector entities (e.g., local, state and national government users are beginning to look at this dependence more critically, but both private and public K-12 entities should do the same.  Numerous open source options can be found online.  As noted above, you could start the strategic review and the learning process at sites like schoolforge.net, eduforge.org or osalt.com.  You could also join helpful discussion groups, such as the [http://members.opensource.org/mailman/listinfo/osi-edu-discuss Open Source Initiative Education Project].

=== DETAILED DISCUSSION OF “WHY DO SOME VENDORS GIVE SCHOOLS FREE CC?” ===

==== Current Policy Towards Schools Consistent with Historic Practice ==== 

''Google, MS and Zimbra Have Always Favored Educational Clients –'' Google, “founded by a research project at Stanford University,” seems sincere in its desire to “give back to the educational community” (LINK to FAQs for Google’s Apps for Education).  Microsoft has historically voiced similar sentiments.  Zimbra started as an open source email and collaboration package for small businesses, but was also adopted by a number of educational institutions.   Google introduced Google Apps for Education in October 2006, but only began distributing the suite widely in 2008. MS had long offered free or heavily discounted software to educators beginning Live@edu as a hotmail service in March 2005.  Each (plus Zimbra) has continued to add features to their free educational package as they developed new technology or, in the case of Microsoft and especially Google, acquired companies for their technology.  The current offers are thus consistent with past corporate policy towards educational institutions, but long-term business benefits are clearly part of their decision-making. 

==== Building Brands Builds Long-Term Business and Good Will ==== 

Savvy readers may be suspicious about anything that’s “free” so this section discusses the potential business benefits derived by Google, Microsoft (MS) and Zimbra from their free offerings to educational clients. 

* ''Positive Public Image Possesses Business Value'' – It’s also undeniable that contributing to education, especially during tough times, helps build a corporation’s short-term and long-term public image – and thus its marketplace “brand.” Good will is an intangible business asset  that may positively affect ongoing decisions made by a range of constituents influencing future business success, from many types of prospective paying customers to government regulators (e.g., those currently assessing anti-trust issues for Google in the U.S. and Europe). 

* '' Early Conversion of Users to Brand Supports Long-Term Business Success''  – From a marketing and business perspective, corporations highly value the conversion of young users to their “brand” of products and services.  Instilling brand loyalty among K-12 students (and their teachers) can produce manifold long-term business benefits.  Every marketer knows it’s far more expensive on a per-person basis to convert new users than to retain existing consumers.  By graduation, millions of K-12 students will likely have acquired some degree of brand loyalty to the brand of products and services they’ve used so frequently; they may already possess a disinclination to switch to another company’s unfamiliar products and services if they have a choice in the future. MS fully acknowledges this long-term objective for Live@edu: “Our goal is to introduce our services to students who are beginning to form online habits, discover that these services help reduce the time it takes to finish coursework while at the same time helping them stay connected with friends and family, have them fall in love with them, and use them for life.”  After high school or college, many in this new generation will have influence over purchase decisions regarding similar capabilities and resources from these same companies.

* ''Educators and Educational Institutions Provide Valuable Implicit or Explicit Endorsements'' - Computing systems endorsed by educators and educational institutions are viewed by many as having received an implicit seal of approval.  Some make it explicit; many technology directors for universities and colleges and K-12 institutions have provided Google and MS with actual filmed or written testimonials published online, as well in what might be considered “selling materials”.  Though the value of an endorsement, implied or explicit, is arguably higher if given by a technology director or professor from a college or university known for technological or academic prowess, any cloud computing company would benefit if they were simply able to list your K-12 institution as client without a written or filmed testimonial.

* ''Relatively Small Incremental Investment Due to Economies of Scale'' – The incremental investment required of Google to serve the K-12 market is less than one might think.  Each is essentially offering the core products and services underlying enhanced premium versions of cloud computing packages sold on a per-user basis.  In addition, massive economies of scale in areas like storage sharply reduce the marginal cost of adding another client institution.  

* ''Long-Term Option for Fee-Based Products and Services for Education'' - Google and Microsoft (and, to some degree, Zimbra) can afford to take the long-term view.  Both may eventually charge a fee for their cloud-based products and services for educational clients, but that isn’t likely to happen for years.  In Google’s pending contract with Teachers College, there is no guarantee that all cloud computing capabilities and resources will be free for the full five-year agreement; should Google begin charging any fees, however, TC has the right to break the contract and take back all its data with Google’s assistance – an inconvenience, but also a protection.  

If and when any fees are charged for what’s now free, it’s probable that Google and Microsoft’s even more massive future economies of scale will help keep costs much lower than cloud computing competitors.  At that point, though, even just one penny for every user will represent over $100 million per year in revenue globally; every added dime in user fees would mean at least $1 billion in incremental revenue annually.

=== DETAILED DISCUSSION OF “WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF CC?” ===

Though examined individually, advantages such as scalability and decreased maintenance are also factors contributing to cloud computing’s primary benefit: lowered costs.  In addition, please note there are minuses associated with some of the benefits discussed below.  These concerns will be discussed in the next section.

==== Detailed Discussion of Easy Scalability ====

The scalability advantages of CC include:

''Consuming Only What You Need'' - The ability to expand or reduce the scale of your usage easily and rapidly is one of the primary benefits of cloud computing.   

“Paying As You Go” - As noted above, the metered nature of cloud computing means you only pay for what you actually use.

''Making a Minimal Upfront Investment'' - The scalable nature of cloud computing eliminates the investment formerly required to meet predicted peak load usage. 

''Changes Made Easier, Faster and Cheaper'' - By switching to a cloud computing vendor, you are essentially delegating almost all of the following responsibilities and the associated costs of scaling up (or down to some extent) to an outside contractor.  This is a big plus with the one obvious minus of loss of control.

* ''Less Time'' – Previously, many hours were required to review and analyze issues including selection of the right new server capabilities or addressing other hardware or software needs

* ''Less Trouble'' – No more hassles merging and ironing out conflicts between old and new systems…those are the vendor’s problem. 

* ''Less Money'' – Last but not least, you don’t have to buy any more new hardware and software to accomplish the CC functions you select

==== Detailed Discussion of More Flexibility ====

''Upgrades Are Much Cheaper and Can be Reversed Easily'' - The ability to quickly and easily shift platforms or change applications in a cloud-based system is another flexibility bonus.  In a traditional computing network system, it can be both difficult and expensive to reverse a commitment (e.g., one made by a predecessor) to specific type or brand of infrastructure.  Upgrades of software applications involve many fewer complications and staff labor costs.

''CC Can Typically Accommodate Multiple Formats'' - Clouds are designed to upload documents created in a range of software formats, solving a common problem for K-12 students; documents created in one computer environment (e.g., home or library) that cannot be opened in another (e.g., school) without a compatibility patch.  (As another sign of sophisticated integration through the cloud, Google plans make it possible for any document to be printed by any printer from any device without the need for compatible printer drivers.)  

''Dramatic Reduction of Documents Stored Locally and Corollary Rise in Document Accessibility'' - Even more basically, the flexible access of cloud storage addresses another reportedly widespread K-12 student problem, especially among younger students: the storage of documents on local storage devices (e.g., CD, flash drive or school library hard drive) that are subsequently lost or cleared.  Students with documents stored on the cloud need no longer transfer documents to local storage devices for transport. 

''Heightened Ability to Experiment with Various Options'' - Depending upon the nature of the cloud computing system chosen, experimentation with alternatives may be accomplished more easily and flexibly.  Experimentation, of course, is one of the foundations of academic and technological inquiry.  With greater opportunities for experimentation, you may be able to evaluate new ways to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of your K-12 computing systems.   On the other hand, if you choose free cloud computing from a sole source vendor, your choices are limited to those provided by that vendor.

==== Detailed Discussion of Increased Mobility ====

''Vastly Increased Mobile Access'' - One key benefit of cloud computing is increased mobile access.  Apps offered in the cloud are being customized for integration into a range of devices.  Since you access cloud computing resources through a web browser, all appropriately integrated apps can be deployed from anywhere on any Internet-enabled device.   

''Ability to Use Multiple Devices'' - The use of mobile phone browsers, including higher end “smartphones” or “app phones,” by K-12 students for educational purposes is currently at very low levels versus usage for social or entertainment purposes. Prohibitions on their in-school use are clearly a limiting factor.  The use of other mobile devices for education (e.g., iPod-like devices, tablet computers and iPad-like devices or the low-cost netbooks discussed in Chapter 30) is only beginning to expand.  Experts believe the use of mobile devices for education and other non-social or entertainment uses will rise rapidly within two-to-three years.
  
''Significance of Apple’s Recent Market Growth in Underscoring Mobility as Priority'' - When Apple passed Microsoft in market capitalization (now over $227 billion), some saw the event as a symbolic dividing line between past and future uses of computer technology, as well as a salient indicator of future trends.  Apple’s rapid business gains are due to devices you can hold in your hand (e.g., iPods, iPhones and iPads), while Microsoft’s core business still lies with devices that sit on your desk. The ratio of a company’s stock price to earnings per share is a measure of how optimistic investors are about the prospects for a company’s products and services; Apple’s current P/E is 21 versus 13 for Microsoft.  Comparative growth in stock price is another salient measure; in the past five years, Apple’s stock price has risen over 550%, while Microsoft has been essentially flat at 4%. 

''Access to the Cloud Will Be More Equitable Due to Cheaper Mobile Devices'' - The ability to use less expensive devices than desktops for schoolwork will also address one shrinking, but still significant, source of educational inequity.  According to a 2010 Pew Survey, more than 90% of all U.S. homes with students now have Internet access via computers.  99% of higher-income White households were wired, but the proportion of lower-income Latino and African American students with Internet access at home has only recently surpassed 80%.

''A Good Overview of Future Trends in Technology for Education'' - For a perspective on future trends in the use of technology for education, see the [http://wp.nmc.org/horizon-k12-2010/chapters/technologies 2010 Horizon Report by the New Media Coalition].  Selective and effective use of mobile devices other than laptops will help K-12 schools attain more educational goals; more broadly, one key to enhanced educational use of technology is more widespread use of the cloud.

==== Detailed Discussion of Less Maintenance and Support ====
 
''Substantial Drop in Staff Time for Maintenance (Now a Majority of Labor Hours for Most K-12 Institutions)'' - Time spent in ongoing maintenance of infrastructure (e.g., servers) will almost certainly decrease substantially with cloud computing, since most maintenance duties are effectively being outsourced.  You know how much of your department’s time is spent on maintenance, but surveys have generally shown a steady increase over the last decade to levels as high as 70% of overall staff time.
 
''No Need to Install Applications Individually'' - Cloud computing applications don't have to be installed individually on every user's computer.  Thus, they are much easier to support and upgrade since any improvements or changes reach all users instantly when they link to the cloud.  Since applications are usually delivered to multiple tenants of the cloud, however, you should ask about the any consequent limitations to customization.

''Many Report Less Time Needed for Ongoing User Support Post-CC-Transition '' - Online feedback and case studies of converts to CC – as well as TC’s own surveys of technology directors at other universities that have switched to Google Apps for Education specifically — indicate that time spent on user support for applications has dropped for most. Reasons cited include well-integrated, user-friendly apps backed by brief, clear online tutorials in video and text.   In case histories, estimates of the percentage of support saved when moving to the cloud time range from 20% to 80%. 

''Transition Time Usually Much Less Than Feared'' - Because of the sophistication of the integration offered by CC vendors, the transition to a new cloud computing system for a K-12 institution may be shorter and less troublesome than you may think.  The transition to Google Apps for Education, for instance, follows a standard six-week progression.  Several technological directors described the transition and relatively trouble-free, if not seamless.  While there clearly is an increase in technology staff responsibilities during the transition, interviews and other feedback indicate that almost all problems arising from merging old systems with the Google Apps cloud were ironed out within that six-week window.

''Some Report Surplus Time Spent on Integration of Technology, but Obviously That Choice Would Be Yours'' - Some of those surveyed or interviewed for case studies stated that the time saved on maintenance and support frees technology staff to contribute more to activities that directly support educational goals, such as better integration of collaborative technology with teaching.  Many do, however, create a new position (or part-time position or multiple positions) administering CC operations and ongoing issues.

==== Detailed Discussion of Lower Costs ==== 

If one chooses to outsource both data storage and software applications from the cloud, two major categories of K-12 technology costs will be immediately reduced: 1) upfront capital expenditures on future hardware and other physical resources associated with your computing network and 2) future software licensing fees.  

True cost savings cannot be determined without assessing your Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). For tips on where to go to learn how to calculate your TCO, please see below.

''Doing More with Much Less “on the Ground”'' - In general, your institution can do more with less, because almost all needs for processing, storage, networking and applications can be met with access to the cloud.  The range of ever more productive mobile devices (detailed in the above discussion of greater user mobility) are all cheaper than current-day desktops and laptops.  Netbooks  (see Chapter 30 in this wikibook) are salient trend of the future, but some schools now save money by looking to the past.  Many schools on a tight budget have also discovered that cloud computing makes it possible to resurrect less powerful computers more than a decade old, as in [http://www.eschoolnews.com/2009/03/04/subscription-based-cloud-helps-pike-county-extend-computers-to-more-students this case study].  

''Utility Computing Approach Slashes Need for Investment –'' The metered nature dramatically reduces the investment, monetary and otherwise, made in hardware or software needed for peak, infrequent or one-time intensive computing activities.  From an accounting standpoint, these costs would be transferred off the balance sheet, freeing up working capital for other funding needs.

''Cloud Computing Vendors’ Economies of Scale Yield Customer Savings'' - Because a cloud computing vendor typically serves multiple clients, there are many costs that can be spread over a much larger base than your K-12 institution, such as enhanced infrastructure and software.  Other price rates are just lower than a K-12 institution may be able to secure, especially K-12 institutions in high-cost urban areas. Costs for real estate and electric power are often lower than those for educational institutions, for instance, because cloud computing providers can locate server and data center facilities in rural or even remote locations where many costs are comparatively lower.  In a very competitive industry, a large part of these savings are passed on to customers. 

''Separate Analyses Show Approximate Savings of $200 Per Computer or $50 Per User Per Year is a Conservative Estimate'' - Based on the analysis conducted below, an average K-12 institution should save at least $50 per user per year in direct and indirect costs with cloud computing.  The rate of savings per computer depends on the average number of users per client computer, but $200 per computer per year is a reasonable estimate given an average public school number of four. What might be termed “back office” cost savings on support, maintenance and capital investment could potentially be re-invested in a variety of “front-office” strategies to enhance teacher efficacy and student learning through better integration and increased use of technology. 

''Analysis of Google Apps for Education Costs as Representative Case Study'' - Many schools, both large and small, have found cost savings by moving to the cloud. While this chapter should not be seen as a recommendation to consider the Google Apps for Education option without reviewing other alternatives, the case studies K-12 and higher education available were a good source of some cost savings data, as well as anecdotal reports of user experiences after adopting Google’s cloud-based suite of applications for educational clients.  In general, almost all private educational institutions and most public either failed to aggregate or disclose their cost savings, but hard estimates that were provided were impressive.  

To cite two public K-12 examples, Prince Georges County, MD public schools, the fourteenth-largest public school district in America, reported a $1MM first-year savings in direct hardware investment alone attributable to adopting Google Apps for its 28,000 K-12 faculty and staff.  The Saline Area, MI, a much smaller suburban/rural school district also adopted Google Apps initially for its 600 faculty and staff, choosing to proceed with a roll-out to 3200 students in grades 5-12 in Year 2; before that roll-out, the district Superintendent stated that $400K was saved in the first year, including savings from non-renewal of the prior system, reduced email maintenance, hardware upgrades and ongoing IT support.  Even without any staff time saving (or any Year 2 savings for Saline), both reports support a rough yardstick of $50 per user in total savings.  Case studies for individual K-12 institutions (Bronx IS 339 or Columbia Secondary School are two from New York City) focused on a range of perceived educational benefits without discussing specific cost savings, but it was clear that significant savings had realized. 

Reported cost savings due to cloud computing for public and private college or universities give additional financial perspective. The size of a university computing network presumably facilitates economies of scale unrealizable by the smaller institution at which you may work or will be working, so your current hardware and software cost, and thus your savings, are higher.  Notre Dame University, with 12,000 graduate and undergraduate students and 1200 faculty and staff estimated a total $1.5 million in savings due to the switch to the cloud; Utah State, with 23,000 total students and 800 faculty estimated $800,000 per year.  The technology coordination staff in the Teachers College Academic Computing Department estimates $453,000 will be saved in hardware costs and licensing fees alone in a five-year contract with the Google Apps system they are recommending for 6000 faculty and staff starting in 2011.  These figures show enough consistency to venture a range of estimated cost savings for an average K-12 institution.  TC excluded several areas of potential direct and indirect cost savings (e.g., staff labor hours) that could substantially raise its $15 in direct savings per capita per annum; Utah State, like most, probably omitted some direct staff, as well as indirect costs, from its $34 per head estimate.  Notre Dame’s total savings of $113 per capita may be considered to fall across more than one year. These cases also support a conservative ballpark of $50 per user for a smaller, less efficient K-12 institution.  

Beyond hardware and licensing, the additional factors that should be part of an estimate of reduced Total Cost Ownership (TCO) should almost double these per capita savings (see below discussion of TCO), as would your institution’s likely lower economies of scale.  In addition, studies have shown that further indirect cost savings would add about 80% to your total savings.  Google Apps are largely free, of course, so choice of another cloud computing vendor for other reasons might lower these total savings.   Even so, a reasonable estimate of the savings you might realize versus current TCO including indirect costs could be significantly more than the abovementioned $200 per computer and $50 per capita for the first two years.  These back-office savings could be re-invested in a variety of strategies to enhance teacher and increase student learning. 

''Check for Any Incremental CC Costs, However!'' - While costs for hardware and software will almost certainly decrease, there may be new types of operating expenses associated with cloud computing that must be thoroughly understood by technology coordinators before entering into a contract.  These will be discussed under potential concerns [LINK to “Concerns” section].

==== How Do You Calculate Total Cost Savings Generated by Switch to CC? ====

''Total Cost Ownership (TCO)'' - In general, an accurate comparison of projected costs for any alternative future computing systems, including cloud computing, cannot be made without assessing the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).  As originally defined, the phrase ‘total cost of ownership” refers to all the costs associated with the use of computer hardware and software including administrative costs, licensing costs, deployment and configuration, hardware and software updates, training and development, maintenance, technical support and any other costs associated with acquiring, deploying, operating, maintaining and upgrading computer systems.   These are normally “direct” costs that can be found or extracted from the technology budget.

''Helpful Background and How-To Perspectives on TCO'' – Though certainly best practices, the Total Cost of Ownership is more often calculated by private-sector businesses, governmental organizations and public school districts than by individual schools.  We do recommend you do at least a rough estimate for your K-12 institution.   Excellent comprehensive perspectives on the total cost of ownership for K-12 educational institutions may be found in this presentation of a [http://k12tco.gartner.com K-12 Total Cost of Ownership Tool] and this [http://www.curriculum.edu.au/verve/_resources/total_cost_op.pdf review and analysis  of TCO and open-source software].  You can find more guidance for calculating TCO in many places online, including fill-in-the-blank spreadsheets at [http://archive.is/20130119130156/http://techrepublic.com.com/ TechRepublic], an &quot;online community&quot; of the wider and also useful [http://www.zdnet.com/ ZDNet]. 

''Indirect Costs'' - So-called indirect costs should also be evaluated in any comparison, though they are difficult to estimate.  These costs are largely those borne by the end-user community such as end-user 1) peer support, 2) self-support including hours spent in training classes and more casual learning, 3) time spent in file or storage management, 4) applications development by users or 5) the end-user labor and other costs associated with downtime.  Indirect costs usually amount to 35%-to-50% of total costs.  While they are often considered “soft” or “hidden,” indirect costs are real. 
 
As shown above, we have conducted prototype analyses of the potential cost savings you might realize by switching to cloud computing to give you a preliminary idea of the average cost savings achieved. These analyses recognize TCO and associated indirect costs.  Your institutions costs, of course, may vary significantly for a variety of reasons.

==== Other Potential Benefits Include Security and Reliability ==== 

''CC Security and Reliability Have Advantages and Disadvantages'' - Cost savings, reduced staff time spent in maintenance and support, enhanced flexibility and ease of scalability are all pluses enjoyed, to varying degrees, by almost K-12 institutions that switch to cloud computing.  There are other important cloud computing issues, such as security and reliability, which have both pluses and minuses.  Both the potential benefits and drawbacks associated with these issues will be discussed together below.

=== DETAILED DISCUSSION OF “WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL CONCERNS ABOUT CC?” ===

==== Detailed Discussion of Security ====

''Security and Privacy are Most Common Concerns'' - Security and privacy is often the top concerns for any educational institution considering a switch to cloud computing.  In mid-spring 2010, Yale University, for example, cited concerns with Gmail users’ security and privacy as the reasons for 1) delaying a switch to Google Apps for Education and 2) extending the review by its Information Technology Services.  In late spring 2010, UC Davis cancelled a trial of Gmail for faculty and staff, indicating special concerns with Google Buzz, but was comfortable using Gmail for all UC Davis students.  One of the reasons these two examples were notable, however, is that the number of educational institutions proceeding with plans to move to cloud computing so far outweighs those who’ve gotten cold feet.  

''Importance of Assessing Your Security Priorities'' - Several differing concerns about cloud computing overlap with some aspects of security, including privacy and reliability, but they will be discussed separately below.  Additionally, as you know, there are several inter-related, but different, facets of overall security, such as operational and organizational security; general physical security, including ensuring the integrity of the server; security of applications; and protection from threats from hackers or unauthorized users — but there are some general observations that can be made.  Your assessment of the security factors associated with moving to the cloud will likely include listing many potential minuses, but you’ll also very likely identify some potential pluses that may lower your current security risks.  

''Review of Standard Google Contract Regarding Security'' - TC’s IT department’s analysis of pending contract with Google Apps for Education provided us with some insights on the security and privacy, though mostly for Google Apps for Education.  For whatever reason, Microsoft is not as forthcoming in its online materials on security and privacy measures for Live@edu as Google is for Google Apps for Education, though we secured a recent [http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~swaneybr/buckeyemail/contract.pdf Live@edu contract with Ohio State University].   Reviewing this contract, as well as Google’s general approach to [http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/infrastructure_security.html security for Google Apps for Education] may help you formulate specific security questions for the cloud computing vendors you review.  You should ask Google and Microsoft the same hard questions that you would ask any of the other cloud computing vendors you review about specific security measures that are not initially presented to you, even though 1) you may have less leverage because they are giving you their K-12 cloud computing products and services for free and 2) they may offer less latitude because they undoubtedly want to keep the thousands of contracts they have with schools contracts as uniform.

==== Basic Plus and Minuses of CC Security ==== 

''Some Relative Advantages of CC Contractor Regarding Security'' - On the one hand, no one cares more about the security of your data than you do. When you move your data to the cloud, you are relinquishing much of your control over security features. On the other hand, the cloud computing vendor may be able to employ more sophisticated and up-to-date security measures than you can, especially the larger ones who can spread enhanced security costs and staff over a larger user base.  They may also be able to move more quickly to find solutions to the ever-changing array of security risks, devoting greater resources than you can afford with much smaller staffing and budgets.  The nature of the cloud also enables security updates to be put in place as soon as they are developed, an especially important factor when dealing with a substantial and newly emerging, threat.

''Security Highest Priority Issue for Most Cloud Computing Vendors'' - Cloud computing vendors are aware of the critical importance of security and privacy in preserving their business reputation and maintaining customer trust.  Since any significant breaches will damage future business prospects, security is likely a top priority for vendors’ staff attention and corporate investment.  Be aware that some lower-paying or “pro bono” clients may be placed in a “tier” with less security features so you should ensure that you have all the information you need to balance your security objectives against your budget. This is especially important with smaller vendor.  At no charge, Google is currently offering educational institutions an enhanced security package (designed by the recently acquired Postini) for which business client pay over $10 per user, but this offer to educational clients may not last through 2010. 

''Centralization vs. De-Centralization'' - If your data is currently stored in multiple locations with differing security profiles, the cloud may provide the benefits of greater centralization.  For de-centralized data, the risk of a security breach is as high as a virtual network’s weakest de-centralized link.  Centralization makes it easier to implement uniformly high security measures, but more of your data is vulnerable to a given security breach if it’s located in one location.   Overall, centralization will probably lowers your of a security breach, while increasing the potential damage.   Finally, from yet another perspective discussed more fully in “Reliability and Recovery,” there are distinct advantages to some degree of data replication and storage redundancy.
 
''Security of Server/Storage Locations'' – Yale and UC Davis were both angered when Google would not promise to reveal the precise physical location of all servers on which their data might be stored.  Google states that it does not do so for its own security reasons, though, on judgment, Google’s wish to maintain long-term business flexibility probably was a factor as well.  In emphasizing Google’s security problems in China, Yale’s spokesperson showed he’d clearly not read the Google commitment that satisfied TC; Google guarantees educational clients would not house data in any of 15 higher-risk countries (e.g., China, North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Sudan, Cuba, etc.).  When considering smaller vendors, you should request the physical locations of their servers; you can decide if a guarantee like Google’s is sufficient. 

''Issues with Multi-Tenancy'' -The multi-tenant architecture common to almost cloud computing systems provides advantages, including substantial economies of scale, but you should ask how the potential security issues associated with multi-tenancy have been resolved.  As cloud computing becomes more and more sophisticated, safeguards against “mixing” data are getting very good.  Some cloud computing clients, however, have requested that their data only be housed with clients from the same user category (e.g., education, government, non-profit).  Similar co-tenants may well have to meet similar security, privacy and compliance standards.  

''Highest Vulnerability Typically at the Local Level'' - Any K-12 technology coordinator knows the primary security weaknesses exist at on the local end-user level, a problem compounded by the increasing mobility of users’ devices. It should be noted that in a cloud computing network, almost all data is stored on the cloud rather than locally, substantially decreasing the amount of stored data at risk in local devices. 

''Ways to Decrease Local Vulnerability'' - There are several relatively easy ways to decrease the vulnerability the email system that is such an integral component of your K-12 CC network.  Webmail itself can never be described as 100% secure, though comprehensive email encryption (over and above the limited encryption employed by webmail providers) can reduce your webmail risk to minimal levels.  Even though encryption software’s quality and ease of use has increased significantly along with availability (including many free and open-source options), far too few beyond business IT departments take advantage of these wise security measures. Technology coordinators that wish to further limit vulnerability in a cloud-based system are encouraged to review open-source options available via [http://www.gnupg.org the GNU Privacy Guard Project].   If you want to further increase security in a cloud-based network accessed by many mobile devices, one particularly interesting strategy involving the creation of one-time passwords on roaming devices is presented in [http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/78026/1569113867_final_email.pdf.pdf this white paper titled “One-Time Password Access to any Server without Changing the Server”]. 

''Google Security Breakdown'' - In yet another example of confusion, critics of Google Apps viewed the Google Street View fracas in Europe in spring 2010 as a Google security flaw. As  you may recall, Google came under fire in Europe and, subsequently, several U.S. Congressmen for mistakenly recording data from unprotected WiFi networks while recording Google Street View and laying the groundwork for future Google Mobile apps.  From a standpoint of security (as opposed to Google’s failure to apply proper oversight in Street View data collection), it was actually just another illustration of many local end-users’ failure to employ appropriate security measures. Data from unprotected networks and devices can be easily captured in a number of ways, of course, including a growing array of free or moderately priced “packet sniffers.”   Accessing private data from unprotected networks and devices may be illegal but it’s easy to do if the precautions similar to those suggested above are not taken.
   
''Specific Microsoft and Google Security'' - While Microsoft and Google institute more sophisticated overall security on an ongoing basis than the huge majority of K-12 institutions, they are also obviously more attractive targets.  The sheer market dominance of Microsoft operating systems (roughly 90% of users globally versus 5% for Apple and 3% for Linux, though expert estimates vary), as well as its IE browser (about 50% of users versus 30% for FireFox, 7% for Google Chrome and 5% for Safari) make Microsoft by far the most popular target for the most talented hackers. 
 
''Google Questions Microsoft Security and Vice Versa'' - Google has announced that its own future use of Microsoft systems would be severely curtailed for security reasons.  Citing the exploitation of MS zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer (the outdated IE 6 was easiest to attack, but the flaw existed in later versions) by Chinese hackers to steal data from a Gmail user’s computer once it had been compromised. Google may have implied that Microsoft security was weaker than that for Apple OSX or Linux, but the number of successful attacks on MS vehicles is mostly a result of Microsoft’s tendency to be targeted much more often.  The decision was probably also influenced Google’s growing competition with MS on a number of fronts. MS standards for security are almost certainly comparable to Google’s in efficacy, especially if you the most updated versions are used and all security patches are downloaded immediately.  MS responded with generalities about their concern over Google Security, but may get more specific later. 

More confusion has arisen over data ownership (the client, not Google, owns the data but this will be discussed in the “Privacy” section below).

==== More Next Steps to Enhance Security ==== 


''First, Ask If CC Vendor Has Passed a Standard “SAS 70” Security Audit''  - One quick means to determine whether a potential vendor has established adequate security standards is to ask whether they have passed an SAS 70 Audit. The AICPA’s (i.e., American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) “[http://sas70.com/sas70_overview.html Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70, Service Organizations]” sets relatively demanding and widely recognized standards for controls over information, including data storage in the cloud.  

''Full CC Vendor Reporting Essential to Security'' - As noted, one recommended next step is to designate a staff member at your school to manage and closely monitor your cloud computing system, with ongoing security being a key element of his or her job description.  You cannot satisfactorily monitor security and overall performance without being able to audit all relevant activity. Before signing any contract with a cloud computing vendor, it is essential that you are specific about all the metrics you want to see, since the vendor may well have to set up additional systems to meet your objectives. 

''Hiring Monitoring Services'' - Some reports, such as logs of every attempt to access your cloud network, may be too detailed or voluminous to audit in an efficient manner.  You may want to consider hiring one of the growing number of relatively low-cost cloud monitoring services to keep tabs on potential security breaches, [http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2010/02/04/cloud-monitoring-services-a-resource-guide a good &quot;starter list&quot; of which is here].

''The Cloud Security Alliance'' - A great source for general information is the [http://www.cloudsecurityalliance.org Cloud Security Alliance] is a non-profit organization formed to promote the use of best practices for providing security assurance within cloud computing

==== Detailed Discussion of Privacy ====

As noted, security and privacy issues are interwoven.

''The Only Acceptable Standard'' - The contracts for both Google and Microsoft make it clear that clients own all data and you should accept nothing less.  

''CC Multi-Tenancy Threat to Privacy'' – In any multi-tenant CC situation, privacy is also an issue.  Again, full reporting by the CC vendor should help illuminate any breaches of both security and privacy.

''Data Requests from Foreign Governments'' - The well-publicized security breaches in China have also generated confusion about whether Google and other cloud computing companies may be forced to reveal data if requested by a local countries’ government.  The simple fact that the security breaches were hacks by unknown individuals versus anything formally approved and organized by the Chinese government efforts is sometimes forgotten.  Moreover, foreign governments are very unlikely to request data housed for another country’s educational institutions by a private multinational CC vendor.  Even if they did request it, Google and any other CC vendor would adamantly refuse to surrender it, citing overwhelming legal precedent.  In rare situations, an exception might be argued if the data was manifestly demonstrated to be critical to solving a criminal case such as a homicide, but, even then, the CC vendor would proceed with great reluctance. 
 
''Data Requests by U.S Government'' - U.S. K-12 institutions should be more concerned about data requests from U.S. governmental entities.  U.S. Federal and state law clearly does provide extensive privacy protections to individual students and schools.  Cases like the National Security Agency’s (NSA) successful request for phone data on suspected terrorists or their accomplices, however, illustrate that the prevention of possible, but uncertain, future negative events may be considered the basis for data requests from the U.S. government.  This is a slippery slope, but we’ve yet to slide down very far, especially with regard to educational institutions.

==== Detailed Discussion of Advertising ==== 

''The Issue of Unwanted Advertising Concerns Many'' - The advertising that some fear may accompany free cloud computing services is a much-discussed subset of the overall privacy issue about which there is much confusion (once again).  Exposure to advertising is often the price one pays for “free” online services so assumptions are made.  No one likes to see ad messages appended to personal communications.  Beyond that, some types of online targeting may result in genuine breaches of privacy and, potentially, security issues.  One oft-cited example is the scanning of email text in Gmail that enables relevant ads to be served to respective users.  This constitutes passive “data mining,” but when personal data is actively saved to build a behavioral profile, that’s an even greater intrusion of privacy.  Many, however, respond negatively to the prospect of these intrusions without doing their homework, including some members of the Yale and UC Davis review committee, 

''Microsoft and Google Set Clear Contractual Limits (with Google Being Most Strict in Banning Advertising to Current Clients and Microsoft Opening Door to Advertising Their Own Products and Services)'' - Microsoft and Google place clear limits on advertising and use of personal data in their respective cloud computing contracts for schools.  In addition to the contract language, Google references its overall [http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html Privacy Policy] set forth in its Privacy Center.  The default setting on Google Apps for Education prevents any advertising at all from being served to students and staff.  Microsoft states that it will not serve any “third-party” advertising, but strongly indicates that ads for Microsoft products and services will be delivered to both students and staff.  Both companies also state that they reserve the right to serve ads to any alumni or non-staff or non-student users.  

Privacy Always An Issue, Even If Breaches Due to “Mistakes” Alone - There’s no question that companies that host cloud-based resources can much more easily monitor users’ communications and stored data.  Privacy can be more easily breached in unlawful ways (e.g., an individual working for a cloud computing vendor), but it can also be breached in a manner considered lawful (as with recent monitoring of millions of phone calls by the U.S. National Security Agency).  In addition, of course, mistakes made by cloud suppliers can also provide openings for invasions of privacy.   

Security and privacy are also linked to compliance issues.

==== Detailed Discussion of Compliance ==== 

''Compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is Assured'' - The pending TC contract for Google Apps for Education specifies TC’s 1) full ownership of all data with privacy guarantees that are well beyond FERPA specifications, 2) full control of all accounts and feature selection and 3) school-specific email addresses (jdewey@tc.columbia.edu, for example, not jdewey@gmail.com).   Microsoft and others have similar policies.

''You Should Require All Vendors to Ensure Full Compliance'' - In general, you should demand that any cloud computing vendor you select abides by all relevant compliance requirements.  In many cases, you will want to structure the reporting of data to ensure that full compliance is achieved.

==== Detailed Discussion of Portability ====

''Future Data Portability Critical to Ensure, But Often Ignored or Dismissed'' - Portability of data is a major issue that many technology directors overlook. While some in the industry rightly feel that the long-term success of the cloud computing industry rests partially on uniform standards and have initiated efforts to do so, there is little uniformity now.  From a vendor’s selfish perspective, in fact, it may be seen to advantageous if idiosyncratic standards make it very difficult for you to take your business elsewhere.

''The Importance of Having An Exit Strategy'' – Similar to the necessity for a Disaster Recovery Plan for your K-12 school, you should never enter a contract for cloud computing without an exit strategy. You and your K-12 institution may choose to leave a vendor for reasons you cannot anticipate now.  An unacceptable increase in future fees is just one example of a possible scenario.  Google makes a contractual commitment not to charge anything for four years, but Microsoft dodges the question in both its five-year contract and its FAQs.  Second, a smaller cloud computing vendor may choose to suspend service for a range of reasons or the vendor may implement unacceptable changes after a merger or acquisition or, in a hotly competitive sector where margins are continually decreasing, your chosen vendor company may simply go out of business. 

''Portability Issue Paramount with Smaller CC Vendors'' - Especially if you choose a smaller vendor, you should determine precisely how the data the will be stored in advance (in terms of format and other aspects).  Some industry leaders are pushing for more uniform standards for cloud computing, but, until this objective is met, you need to be careful.   Other questions include 1) how much a transition from the system will cost, if anything and 2) how long a typical transition takes.  You should obtain as many guarantees as possible regarding any future transition away from the vendor.  A worst-case scenario that is happening less frequently as the industry matures is that your data is stored in such a manner that makes it practically impossible to transfer.  A more common scenario is that the dollars and time expended greatly exceed expectations, crippling your operations for a period of time while the transition is effected.  Future difficulties can be greatly lessened or prevented entirely with a clear exit strategy. 

==== Detailed Discussion of Recovery ====

''Ability to Recover may be Enhanced by CC, But Concerns Remain'' - In general, the offsite nature of cloud computing will likely improve your potential data loss risk and, given the right advance planning, positively affect your recovery time as well.  As with other concerns above, however, outsourced offsite services and capabilities means “out of your direct control.”    

''Incorporate CC Functions into Existing Disaster Recovery Plan, Because “It’s When, Not If”'' - With any school network, it’s not a question of whether your network will go down or crash, but when it will do so.  Historic events have shown the same axiom applies to the biggest and most sophisticated networks, such as those maintained by Google. You may well already have a Disaster Recovery Plan, [[K-12_School_Computer_Networking/Chapter_15|as discussed in Chapter 15]] of this Wikibook.  If not, however, before you enter a contract with a cloud computing vendor, you should establish 1) your Recovery Time Objective (RTO) based on how long you can go without being able to use or access your network and 2) Recovery Point Objective (RPO) based on how much of your data you want to be able to retrieve and restore rapidly.   To a great degree, these are independent considerations so you must establish priorities and weigh them against the costs in time and money. 

''Recovery Time Objective (RTO) Versus Recovery Point Objective (RPO) '' - Most businesses emphasize RTO over RPO, though both are obviously important. For your school, RPO may be the most important measure, especially when it comes to data necessary for compliance.  You should compare your current recovery system against what you might achieve with a cloud computing system.  A tape back-up system in which the tapes are stored in an offsite vault means that the tapes must be found and then transported back to your school: a recovery time that’s measured in days.  If you absolutely need a file that you saved yesterday, that taped back-up system might represent a poor RPO as well. An onsite back-up disc system would improve both your RTO and RPO, but it has its costs. Up-to-the-minute online backup could make it much easier and faster to locate that specific file, but slow down recovery time.  The replacement of a server’s hard drive might require hundreds of gigabytes of information and streaming 1 TB of data over a T1 line could take weeks. 

''Google and Microsoft Contractual Parameters for Recovery'' - Google and Microsoft have both set contractual parameters for their responsibility to clients in the case of “downtime” their free services, with Google's simple policy [http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/terms/sla.html presented here], though compensation for downtime comes in the form of days added to the already free contract.  With Google and Microsoft, the odds that data will be irretrievably lost are low enough they consider these very rare events on a case-by-case basis. With smaller cloud computing vendors you may prefer, replication and recovery-focused via software and redundant hardware across a given number of remote locations are the means to dramatically lower the costs in time, trouble and money of recovery.  But beyond a certain level, lowering the recovery time and increasing the percentage of data retrieved can cost huge amounts of money.  Since every minute of downtime can cost a large financial services company hundreds of thousands of dollars, for example, it may well be worth investing in systems that lower RTO to what’s known as “five nines” for “mission critical” data and server availability (i.e. accessible 99.999% of the time or, conversely, just 5 minutes of downtime per year); “four nines” for business vital data and hardware, etc.  Your school may be conservative so 95% may be too low, but a plan representing a hypothetical 99% should be sufficient for a school for general data.  In addition to the cloud, you would be wise to store or replicate locally all special data that must not be lost.

==== Detailed Discussion of Indirect Costs ====

''Calculate All Indirect Costs In Addition to Direct Costs'' - There are much fewer direct monetary costs with Google and Microsoft than with a smaller vendor, but you should carefully assess the number of likely indirect costs for any prospective vendor.  Any and all labor hours that might be devoted to launching, maintaining and monitoring a new system should clearly be projected and “costed out.”  This should include estimated time for orientation for teachers, students, administrative staff and even parents.  Other costs (e.g., new written materials, any new hardware you’d like, new systems for compliance reporting, etc.) will occur to you as you brainstorm.  There are sure to be labor costs associated with ensuring the selective transition of historic data and replacement or adaptation of ancillary software or hardware.  Just as in a move to a new office or home, the transition is a perfect time to throw stuff out!

==== Detailed Discussion of Hidden Costs ==== 

''Beware of Hidden Costs with Paid Vendors...'' - K-12 technology coordinators must understand exactly “how they are billed for what” before signing any cloud computing contract.   Usage of all cloud computing resources must be measured with accuracy.  Billing for this usage, whether for applications, data storage or any other product or service, should be reported on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis.   As noted above, assigning a specific cloud administrator (or taking on this function yourself as your duty split changes) is likety to be wise.  Some form of independent cloud monitoring service could be invaluable too. 

''...But Hidden Costs Not Just An issue with Paid Vendors'' – While calculation of the Total Cost of Ownership (see above) of your current K-12 school network is critical for determining cost savings achievable by switching to the cloud, calculation of the potential costs of a CC system are just as important in determining whether such a move makes senses financially.  The lowered costs of upgrades, maintenance and support in dollars and staff time are the obvious estimates to make.  The indirect costs are harder to estimate, but they must be identified and approximated if you are to present an accurate picture.

=== GETTING FEEDBACK ON CLOUD COMPUTING VENDORS BEFORE YOU SWITCH ===

Again, Google's Apps for Education is used as a case study since it affords the most information on user responses.  For other vendors, you should look for similar sources of information, e.g., online testimonials and critique; feedback from institutions who have made the switch to whatever vendor you are considering; and impressions garnered fro help forums about what can go wrong.

''Feedback from K-12 and Higher Education Institutions on Google Apps for Education'' - A review of just one collection of case studies and filmed testimonials by academic users from institutions similar to your own may inform your general learning about the positive attributes of Google Apps specifically and, to some degree, cloud computing generally. Of the almost [http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/edu/customers.html 50 highly positive “stories”] told or written by the Google Apps for Education users themselves, 75% are higher-education versus 25% K-12.  There are a wide variety of types of institutions represented for each category.  You are encouraged to search using phrases like “Google Apps for Education” and “school district” if you want more independent feedback.  You can also visit [http://edu.googleapps.com/ Google Apps for Education discussion forums].

''Teachers College Feedback'' - Teachers College sought current user feedback from some of the universities with “posted “stories”, but contacted many other Google Apps cloud computing users as well.  These ranged from large and technologically sophisticated universities like Cornell, Brown and UVA to smaller private colleges like Oberlin, Hamilton and Lehigh.   All apparently indicated a high degree of user and technology staff satisfaction, as well as substantial cost savings.
    
''One Good Way To Assess “What Might Go Wrong”'' - Conversely, if you want to know almost everything that can go wrong, as well as experts’ (mostly from Google) responsiveness online, skim the posts that catch your eye in the [http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/apps-education?hl=en Google Apps for Education Help Forum], especially those listed as most “popular&quot;.  

Both testaments to strengths and weaknesses should be taken with a grain of salt.  For example, the the link above is by far the highest number of case study .pdfs and videos conveniently located on one Web page for you, but they all have been selected and posted by Google.  Conversely, as another example, most of you know the general tenor of “help” seekers with a problem based on experience in your own K-12 institution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Parameters===
This template can be used to make [[Go|go]] board, with stones and various other marks. For example,
{|border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;8&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;background:transparent&quot;
|-valign=&quot;middle&quot;
|&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Goban 5x5|=
  |  |  |  |  | b|=
  | b|bT| A|-c| b|=
  |  | c|w2|  |  |=
  | w| -| w| b| w|=
  |  |  | w| w|  |=
|24|u=u|d=d|l=l|r=r}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
|produces
|{{Goban 5x5|=
  |  |  |  |  | b|=
  | b|bT| A|-c| b|=
  |  | c|w2|  |  |=
  | w| -| w| b| w|=
  |  |  | w| w|  |=
|24|u=u|d=d|l=l|r=r}}
|}
* The first parameters are one or two letters codes (sometimes three), that specify which tile is used. Though a preceding space is OK, be sure '''''not''''' to leave a space after that code.
* On the last line, the &quot;24&quot; parameter is the size of each tile (in pixels), it should preferably be even for correct centering of cells.
* The last four parameters ''|u=u|d=d|l=l|r=r'' specify which borders should be drawn (up, down, left and right). For instance, to draw an upper right corner, the final code is simply ''|u=u|r=r'' (and remember to place the hoshi point accordingly).
NB: The last four parameters are not used in the 19×19 Goban template.

===Static stones and Joseki series ===
{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;8&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid #AAAAAA;border-collapse:collapse;text-align:center&quot;
|-valign=&quot;top&quot;
|[[Image:Go b.png|24x24px]]&lt;br /&gt;b
|[[Image:Go bT.png|24x24px]]&lt;br /&gt;bT
|[[Image:Go b1.png|24x24px]]&lt;br /&gt;b1
| ...
|[[Image:Go b9.png|24x24px]]&lt;br /&gt;b9
|-valign=&quot;top&quot;
|[[Image:Go w.png|24x24px]]&lt;br /&gt;w
|[[Image:Go wT.png|24x24px]]&lt;br /&gt;wT
|[[Image:Go w1.png|24x24px]]&lt;br /&gt;w1
| ...
|[[Image:Go w9.png|24x24px]]&lt;br /&gt;w9
|}
These stone series are available as black (''b'') and white (''w''). They can be marked by a triangle (T) or a number from 1 to 9 (allowing short sequences).

===Fuseki series===
{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;8&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid #AAAAAA;border-collapse:collapse;text-align:center&quot;
|-valign=&quot;top&quot;
|[[Image:Go 00.png|24x24px]]&lt;br /&gt;00
|[[Image:Go 02.png|24x24px]]&lt;br /&gt;02
|[[Image:Go 04.png|24x24px]]&lt;br /&gt;04
| ...
|[[Image:Go 96.png|24x24px]]&lt;br /&gt;96
|[[Image:Go 98.png|24x24px]]&lt;br /&gt;98
|-valign=&quot;top&quot;
|[[Image:Go 01.png|24x24px]]&lt;br /&gt;01
|[[Image:Go 03.png|24x24px]]&lt;br /&gt;03
|[[Image:Go 05.png|24x24px]]&lt;br /&gt;05
| ...
|[[Image:Go 97.png|24x24px]]&lt;br /&gt;97
|[[Image:Go 99.png|24x24px]]&lt;br /&gt;99
|}

These 100 tiles are used for game transcription, where the numbering goes beyond 10. Even numbers are always white, and odd numbers are always black (since black gets to make the first move of the game). The numbering is limited to the 00-99 range for practical reasons, it is assumed that there will be a figure change at least every 100 play.

Note the difference between ''02'' (with a leading zero) and ''b2''.

===Board and board marks===
The useful marks are:
* Capital letters from A to I, create the corresponding marks;
* An hyphen or a small x creates the hoshi point.
* A Capital X creates an X-mark.
* A lowercase c creates a small red circle.
The available tiles are:
{|border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;8&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;border:none;text-align:center;background:transparent&quot;

Note: the appropriate cell codes for the borders are generated automatically by default, so you can leave these parameters blank, and fill only the position of stones, or circled empty positions.&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Template subpages|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

==Introduction==

The NouveauBitMap class contains and object of nouveau_bo. This object represents a buffer in memory accessible from GPU (either VRAM or GART). This nouveau_bo object is used in functions like copy and fill.

Nouveau requires minimum pixel block size of 64x64 to use accelerated transfer

UAE P96 up to now, the picasso96 emulation always used RGBFF_CHUNKY which maps to PIXFMT_BGR15 in cybegraphics and the copied the contents via WirtePixelArray to the [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?post_id=51951#forumpost51951 display windows]. When WritePixelArray is used, a conversion between modes is made. I made this conversion based on other drivers, so there should not be a difference here. 
No it tries to get the pixel format via GetCyberIDAttr(modeID, CYBRIDATTR_PIXFMT) and so no format conversions should be necessary. The conversion from PIXFMT_BGR15 to 24bit should not be that slow. Also WritePixelArray is now accelerated so it should be very fast. 



==OpenGL==

When 3D driver wants to blit the render buffer onto a BitMap it needs to get a hold of nouveau_bo that is behind the BitMap and do a GPU copy from its render buffer onto this nouveau_bo object. The render buffer is always in the same pixel format as the BitMap, because it is created based on a BitMap passed when creating GL context.

I think the Amiga 3D API is Warp3D, but I don't know anything more. OpenGL in this context is an alien API. 

Yes, mesa.library is AROS-specific. I have never seen or used libraries you mentioned, but I think it is possible that AROSMesa API is somewhat similar to StormMESA API. I based AROSMesa API on Kalamatee's work which seemed to be based on StormMESA. 


From client perspective using mesa.library is quite simple:

* Create a window
* Call AROSMesaCreateContext passing it the window and some other stuff -&gt; you get rendering context in return
* Call AROSMesaMakeCurrent passing it the context so that AROSMesa knows what to render on
* Render some stuff using glXXX functions
* Call AROSMesaSwapBuffers to have the content of render buffer painted onto your window
* Loop to glXXX functions 


If you are looking for an example, check /tests/mesa/mesasimplerendering.c and examined  AROSMesaCreateContext() code. 

This function is in fact responsible for setting up a &quot;pipe screen&quot; - some entity that is in fact used for rendering. A pipe screen is managed using gallium.library, which in turn works with OOP objects.


Wondering what is done in SDL_Init() and SDL_Quit(); isn't a peropenerbase needed anyway ? 
Hmm. SDL_VideoInit manipulates the global variable &quot;current_video&quot;. But MorphOS's PowerSDL seems to do the same thing. 

Does SDL have a context you pass to each function or does it rely on context beeing &quot;global&quot; (like GL does). If it is the later case, you need to check if context can be per opener (shared by more than one task) or the context needs to be really per task. 

It's the latter. I wonder if those problems are the reason my MorphOS's PowerSDL spawns a ThreadServer task. 

Alternatively you can use the approach I had for Mesa. Mesa always accesses the global context via a macro and in case of AROS this macro actually uses &quot;library-side task local storage&quot; of my own very-simple
implementation. (see AROS/workbench/libs/mesa/src/aros/tls.[ch]). This way the there is no need to do any GL API changes. 




==Reference==


===Backends===

Currently gallium.library knows only two backends: 

 hidd.gallium.nouveau    and    hidd.gallium.softpipe    (a    software implementation). 

This list of backends is hardcoded.

Here i see two design flaws: 

* Hardcoding a list of backends. Adding third backend (for ATI, for example) will require gallium.library modification. 
* A backend object (representing a pipe screen) is created with no arguments.  It  is  not  associated  with  any  display driver object. 



===Card Info===

Nouveau driver is designed in such a way that it stores card information in class static data (automatically disallowing using more than one card). This is a serious flaw. 

In  order  to  overcome  these problems i would suggest to do a thing similar to bitmaps management. I would add a method to graphics driver class,  something  like  moHidd_Gfx_NewPipeScreen.  It would create an object  of  hidd.gallium subclass. The actual subclass would depend on the driver (on which the method is called). 

If  this  method  returns  NULL,  this means that this driver doesn't support  hardware  accelerated  3D. In this case gallium.library would use hidd.gallium.softpipe, as currently.
 gallium.library/CreatePipeScreen() 
this   way  needs  an  argument, something  like Screen *, or better may be ViewPort *. It will pick up display driver object from ViewPort's bitmap: 

&lt;pre&gt;
OOP_Object *drv;
OOP_Object *bm = vp-&gt;RasInfo-&gt;BitMap-&gt;Planes[0];

OOP_GetAttr(bm, aHidd_BitMap_GfxHidd, (IPTR *)&amp;drv);
&lt;/pre&gt;

I don't think moHidd_Gfx_NewPipeScreen is the correct method though, it should be more like moHidd_Gfx_GalliumHiddObject. I'm also reluctant to do this change now as I don't believe I know all of the use cases of gallium.library. Remember that mesa.library is just one of possible clients and you don't really need Screen, nor ViewPort nor BitMap to use GPU. You only need these things if you actually want to blit your rendering onto AROS screen. That's why 3D driver don't have any association with 2D (like the case is now). 

Here comes  an  answer  about  implementing  MM_Query3DSupport  in monitorclass.   We   need   to   add   moHidd_Gfx_QueryHardware3D with pixelformat object as argument. The driver will be able to examine the given pixelformat and tell if it supports hardware 3D.

In case of nouveau, the implementation of moHidd_Gfx_QueryHardware3D should be:

 if (card &gt;= NV30 and bitsperpixelofmode &gt;=16) return TRUE; else return FALSE;

I assume than you will make a following implementation of MM_Query3DSupport:

&lt;pre&gt;
if (moHidd_Gfx_Query3DSupport)
return MSQUERY3D_HWDRIVER;
else if (bitsperpixelofmode &gt;= 16)
return  MSQUERY3D_SWDRIVER;
else
return MSQUERY3D_NODRIVER;
&lt;/pre&gt;

An answer to implementing  MM_Query3DSupport in monitorclass. We need to add   moHidd_Gfx_QueryHardware3D with pixelformat object as argument. The driver will be able to examine the
given pixelformat and tell if it  supports hardware 3D. I see softpipe.hidd works with any pixelformat, so we can safely assume that software 3D works with anything.

I see softpipe.hidd works with any pixelformat, so we can safely assume that software 3D works with anything. With anything that is &gt;= 16 bit. Mesa does not support 256 color rendering. 

What  will  you  say to this? If it's okay, I'll add these methods to the specification.
You can add the moHidd_Gfx_QueryHardware3D but I need time to think over the first method you mentioned. Also the first method is not needed right now for your work on monitorclass.




===Multiple cards===

As any HW GFX driver at this point, Nouveau can only work with one card. It's &quot;old style&quot; driver :)
Actually CreatePipeScreen struct TagItem * tags as parameters. This is done on purpose so that in &quot;future&quot; what you describe is possible by creating additional tags and adding their handling. I wanted to do something very similar to what you described - the CreatePipeScreen would require passing a BitMap to create a proper pipe screen - I just did not get around to implement this.
A note also: this would not magically make nouveau support more than one card, rather a change for the future support.

The semaphore protection is done at the caller level - for example CopyBox or FillRect. I also added explicit notice to the codes:

AROS/workbench/hidds/hidd.nouveau/nouveau.conf
AROS/workbench/hidds/hidd.nouveau/nouveau_intern.h
AROS/workbench/hidds/hidd.nouveau/nouveaubitmapclass.c
AROS/workbench/hidds/hidd.nouveau/nouveauclass.c
AROS/workbench/hidds/hidd.nouveau/nouveaugalliumclass.c
AROS/workbench/hidds/hidd.nouveau/nv04_accel.c
AROS/workbench/hidds/hidd.nouveau/nv50_accel.c

&lt;pre&gt;
/* NOTE: Assumes lock on bitmap is already made */
/* NOTE: Assumes buffer is not mapped */
BOOL HIDDNouveauNV04FillSolidRect(struct CardData * carddata,
    struct HIDDNouveauBitMapData * bmdata, ULONG minX, ULONG minY, ULONG maxX, ULONG maxY, ULONG drawmode, ULONG color)
&lt;/pre&gt;

A bitmap lock is not enough if things like carddata-&gt;chan are global (shared among bitmaps).
One gfx function to bitmap A may happen at the same time as a gfx function to bitmap B.

The drm layer itself take care of synchronizing access to the chan object. Also command buffers are allocated and executed per caller. The mapping/unmapping is about getting a VRAM address for a buffer. Buffer is allocated somewhere in VRAM but it can be moved by drm layer to other locations when needed. In order to get a &quot;access pointer&quot; to the buffer, it needs to be mapped (nouveau_bo_map). When a buffer is mapped, it cannot be moved but also accelerated functions cannot work on mapped buffer - thus for &quot;pointer&quot; access I need to map the buffer while for accelerate access I need to unmap it.

In other places like Linux/X11 things are different, because X11 rendering functions are executed only by single task (X server) but basically moving Wanderer windows while for example having movies played in mplayer or web pages reloading in OWB should be causing command buffers corruption and hang of GPU or corrupted graphics at best. 

Note that most windows are simple refresh windows. Those don't have any offscreen bitmaps.
Rendering into visible areas of this windows go directly into screen bitmap. Rendering into
hidden areas of this windows are ignored.

So most of the rendering goes into a single bitmap: the screen bitmap.

OWB probably mostly uses pixel buffers in RAM:, but no bitmaps.

You would need to have some test program which does some RectFill()ing (or another function which the driver accelerates) in a smart refresh window. Then run it multiple times and make some of the windows fully or partly hidden (rendering into visible parts of smart refresh windows goes directly into screenbitmap, too. Only rendering into hidden parts goes into offscreen bitmaps). Shell (CON:) windows are smart refresh windows at the moment (in theory with charmap support it would be better if they were simple refresh). Some things in layers are pretty unoptimized (causing more back and forth blitting
then really necessary), tough. Maybe you mean windows/layers with superbitmaps? Those are certainly broken, but also pretty useless. 

Does it really matter if that BM_OBJ|COLMAP|COLMOD swapping is done always or not. Back in the era before that (unneeded) &quot;NoFrameBuffer&quot; stuff at least it did not, because if HIDD_Gfx_Show returned the same bm it got as input, the swapping would not really swap anything, as it put the same value in that was already there. 
It seems to matter somehow. Nouveau is a NoFrameBuffer driver and if I was returning the received bitmap, the third resolution change was somehow causing problems (crash or not refreshed display). I were not able to trace the cause, just the not doing the swap makes things work correctly.

Does anybody know why procedures from this tests are not integrate with our HIDD system? They give quite nice boost especially now with GART based transfers for nouveau? The reasoning was that if graphics.hidd is in &quot;ROM&quot; (whether this is the case of not seems to change every couple of years) it could increase size quite a bit, if one added really optimized versions of all conversions. Even if the ones in patchrgbconv give speedup, they are not really optimized. Optimized would mean things like loop unrolling, using SSE or similar where possible, using asm, ... Furthermore for some conversions where dest color format has more bits per RGB than source color format, one may want to have an option which chooses between either fast conversion and more accurate conversion (example &quot;fast&quot;: R5G5B5 -&gt; R8G8B8 == RRRRR000GGGGG000BBBBB000. == pixels get darker, because of the 0 padding) == even more conversion functions and taken up space. By allowing the conversion functions to be patched at runtime, it's also possible to write, compile and check new routines faster (patchrgbconv has option to benchmark and verify if routines work as expected) And it can also be done by outside coders.

'''Compositing''' is the combination of multiple sources of visual input into a single, final image. This is common functionality in expensive, commercial video editors. Some of these (such as Adobe After Effects) use a layer-based compositing engine. Others (such as Apple Shake, The Foundry's Nuke, and eyeon fusion) use a more powerful node-based compositing engine. Blender features a very advanced and powerful compositing engine through the use of the Nodes Editor window. Although the challenge of learning to use nodes may seem intimidating, it can be very rewarding because of the professional-looking final products that can be easily produced.

==Compositing Example==
In this tutorial, we will see how compositing, combined with ''render layers'', can produce some effects that are difficult or impossible to achieve just by straight rendering of a 3D model.

Start with a new Blender document. For a change, let’s use the default cube. Assign it a new material. Keep all the settings at default, but in the Shading panel, set the Emit value to 1.0 and give it an interesting diffuse colour.

Go to the Render context [[File:Blender255RenderContextButton.png]], look for the Post Processing panel, and check the “Edge” box. This will draw a black outline around all objects. If you hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}} to render right now, you should see something like this:

[[File:GlowingCubeWithEdgeOutline.png]]

So far, not very exciting. Now go to the Render Layers context [[File:Blender267RenderLayersContextButton.png]]. You should see there is already an initial default layer called “RenderLayer”. If you look in its Layer panel, you should see checkboxes indicating all the passes of the rendering process to include in this layer. Look for the “Edge” checkbox, and uncheck that. Now click the {{B3D:N2P/Do|+}} icon next to the list of layers, to add a new layer. Look in its Layer panel, make sure “Edge” is checked, and ''un''check all the other checkboxes in the “Include:” section.

Now open up a Node Editor window, and look for the three icons to the right of the menus, showing what kind of nodes to edit: [[File:Blender267NodeEditorTypeIcons.png]]; click on the leftmost one (if it’s not already selected) to enable compositing nodes. Now check the “Use Nodes” box to the right of it. You should now see the initial default node setup, with a single Render Layers node feeding the initial default render layer directly to the output:

[[File:Blender267DefaultCompositingNodes.png]]

Add another Render Layers node. From its layer popup menu, select the second render layer you created, the one producing the edge outlines (which should be called “RenderLayer.001” if you didn’t change its name).

Now, add a Blur node (Filter submenu of the Add menu). The default Gaussian kind of blur will do fine. Put nonzero values (e.g. 1) into the X and Y fields (otherwise the blur Size value will have no effect). Give it a Size value of, say, 20. Connect the Image output of the first render layer (the one doing everything except the edge outlines) into its Image input.

Add an Alpha Over node (from the Color submenu of the Add menu). Feed the Image output from the Blur node into its ''upper'' image input, and the Image output from the second render layer (the one producing the outline edges) into its ''lower'' image input. Leave the Factor at its default 1.0. Connect the Image output of this Alpha Over node to the Image input of the Composite node (the final output).

When you are done, check that your connections look like this (remember, the exact positions of the nodes are unimportant, except for clarity; what’s important is the connections between them):

[[File:Blender267GlowingCubeCompositingNodes.png]]

The effect of this is to blur the rendering of the cube (apart from the edge outline), and then put the edge outline back on top of it. If you hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}} to render now, you should see something like this:

[[File:GlowingCubeWithEdgeOutlineBlurred.png]]

==Things to Try==

What happens if you put different values into the X and Y fields of the Blur node? Try making the X value different from the Y value.

What happens if you get the inputs the wrong way round into the Alpha Over node?

Try the other blur types available from the menu in the Blur node.

Texture nodes allow you to produce textures that are the result of complex computations. This tutorial will just scratch the surface of what’s possible.

==A Simple “Rainbow” Texture==
Start with a new Blender document. Delete the default cube. Add a new plane object. In the Material context in the Object Properties window, click the icon to the left of the material name to assign a material to the plane (there should already be a default unused one called “Material”). In the Texture context, there should already be a texture called “Tex” assigned to this material. Now split the area showing the 3D view into two side-by-side areas. In the right-hand area, bring up the Node Editor. In its area header, you should see a group of 3 little icons next to the menu [[File:Blender267NodeEditorTypeIcons.png]]; click on the middle one for Texture Nodes. You will see appear, further along the area header, a popup menu containing the names of the textures so far created in your document: this should be showing the name “Tex” of the texture you assigned to the material for your plane object. And to the right of that, there should be a checkbox titled “Use Nodes”. Check that, and you should see a pair of initial nodes immediately appear in the editor: an ''input'' node titled “Checker” and an ''output'' node titled “Output”, with an editable field in it containing “Default”.

There must be at least one output node in the texture definition; the data fed to this will make up the final texture. The names you assign in the Name field will appear in the Texture context in the Object Properties window, in a popup menu titled “Output:”, with one item for each output node. Initially this may show “Not Specified”: change it to “Default”.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Navigation in the Node Editor:''' As in most Blender windows, you can scroll around by dragging with {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}}, and zoom the view in and out with the mouse wheel.}}

Each node window has little coloured circles (terminals) on its left and right edges; the ones on the left edge (if any) are inputs for feeding data from other nodes, and the ones on the right edge (if any) are for supplying data to other nodes. Thus, output nodes have no outputs (they’re the final destination for the data), while input nodes have no inputs. Other node types represent intermediate stages in the processing, so they will have both inputs and outputs.

Back in the Node Editor, click on the titlebar of the “Checker” node window and use either {{B3D:N2P/Do|XKEY}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|DEL}} to delete it. Note that, unlike deleting objects in the 3D view, there is '''no''' confirmation popup: the node immediately disappears. (Of course, you can use {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|ZKEY}} to undo operations in the usual way.)

Now go to the “Add” menu (or use the usual {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|A}} shortcut), find the “Input” submenu, and select the “Coordinates” item. This will add a new input node, which just produces the unadorned texture coordinates as its data. The newly-added node will follow the mouse around; press {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} once you have moved it to a convenient place. You will see the new node has one output terminal, titled “Coordinates”. Left-click on this, and drag to the input terminal in the Output window with the word “Color” and a small rectangular colour swatch next to it. Voilà! A line (effectively a wire) should appear connecting the two terminals, and you should see the big square colour swatch in the Output window change from black to a whole rainbow of colours. That’s your texture!

[[File:Blender267RainbowTextureNodes.png]]

If you make a wrong connection, you can move or cut it by dragging the output end of the wire away from the input terminal it is attached to with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}, to either a new input terminal or simply into an unoccupied space between nodes; when you let go the button, the wire will attach to the new input terminal in the former case, or disappear in the latter case.

At this point, you should be able to hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}} to render, and you will see your plane object with the rainbow texture applied. You can see why I chose a Plane object: being flat, the entire texture is visible from one camera angle.

[[Image:RainbowTextureNodesRender.png]]

==Scalars Versus Vectors==
The wires carry numbers between nodes. These numbers can be of two kinds: a ''scalar'' is a single real quantity, like “0.5”, while a ''vector'' can consist of two, three or four scalars in a sequence, like “(0.5, 0.75, 0.2, 1.0)”. The number of components in a vector is also known as the ''dimension'' of the vector. Two-dimensional vectors can be used to represent texture coordinates, while three-dimensional vectors can represent positions in space. Colours can be represented with 3 dimensions (R, G,B or H, S, V) or 4 dimensions (RGB or HSV plus alpha channel).

Some nodes operate on scalars, while others operate on vectors. And there are nodes where some terminals input or output scalars, while others input or output vectors.

Try this. To the above Coordinates and Output nodes, add a “Separate RGBA” node (under the “Color” submenu of the “Add” menu). Feed the output from the Coordinates node to the “Color” input node of the Separate node. Now connect just the “Red” output terminal from the Separate node to the output node (if you move the newly-created node on top of the existing wire, this should happen automatically):

[[File:Blender267TextureCoordsSeparate.png]]

See how the Output swatch shows just a greyscale ramp running from black on the left to white on the right? This shows how the first dimension of a vector is interpreted as the red component in an RGB colour, but as the X coordinate in a position. Remove the output from the Red terminal (delete the existing wire), and take it from the Green terminal instead (by dragging a new wire from Green to the Color terminal on the Output node); now you will see the ramp going from black at the bottom to white at the top. The second dimension of a vector is the green component in an RGB colour, and the Y coordinate in a position.

The terminals have different colours to remind you what type of data they ''should'' be used for (purplish for coordinates, yellow for colours, grey for scalars), but '''as far as Blender’s Node Editor is concerned, colours and positions are not actually different types.''' Both are vectors, and one can be interpreted as the other. This can be (ab)used for some creative effects! For example, the name of the “Separate RGBA” node says it’s for separating an RGBA colour into its components, but here we are using it to take apart a coordinate vector instead.

Note also in the above, that the Color terminal on the Output node expects a vector RGB colour, but when you feed it a single colour component (i.e. a scalar), it simply replicates it the necessary number of times to make a vector of the required dimension. Since all components of the RGB colour are the same, you get a shade of grey.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Multivibrator 555==
The 555 timer IC is a very versatile and useful component and can be used for many things, from giving clock pulses to switch debouncing and as an output transducer. The basic 555 IC is housed in an 8-pin carrier, and these come in DIL and SOIC formats. They run from 3-15V, and are generally quite hardy devices.

The 555 has 8 pins. The layout of these pins is shown to the right and the function of these pins in given in the table below.
[[image:555 Pinout.svg|right|200px]]

|1||GND||Ground Supply||This is the 0V Power Supply pin for the IC
|-
|2||TR||Trigger||A low voltage (less than 1/3 Vcc) starts the timer
|-
|3||Q||Output||This is where the output signal comes from

==Basic Circuit==

The basic 555 astable circuit is set up like this.

[[image:555 Astable Diagram.svg|300px|center]]

*At higher frequencies and loads, it is advisable to put a 100nF capacitor between Pin 5 and 0V.

The frequency and mark-space ratio are defined by the values of R1, R2 and C1 only. For a roughly even (1:1) mark-spce ratio, R1 is usually set at 1K, and the other resistor (R2) and capacitor are changed to alter the frequency. If better control over the mark-space ratio is required, use the next circuit.

===Design equations===

::&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{1.44}{\left( R_1 + 2R_2 \right)\times C}&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{High time}=0.69 \times \left( R_1 + R_2 \right) \times C&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Low time}=0.69 \times R_2 \times C&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Mark-space ratio}=\frac{R_1+R_2}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

There is an online calculator [http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Bill_Bowden/555.htm here] that will give the frequency, high time and low time for a given set of components.

==Variable mark-space ratio==

This variation allow much easier control of the mark-space ratio without too much impact on the frequency. The only difference is a diode petween Pins 6 and 7, with the cathode at Pin 6. The effect of this is to [[Practical_Electronics/Glossary#S|shunt]] resistor R2 when charging C1. This means that C1 charges though R1 only. This removes R2 from the &quot;high-time&quot; equation, and make calculating the mark-space ratio easier and prevents the frequency from being altered excessively by changes in the mark-space ratio ( although this still happens to a certain extent).

[[Image:555 Mk-sp Diagram.svg|300px|center]] 

===Design equations===

::&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{1.44}{\left( R_1 + R_2 \right)\times C}&lt;/math&gt;. 

::''This is different to the [[#Design equations|design equation]] for the standard 555 Astable. (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; instead of 2R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)'' 

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{High time}=0.69 \times R_1 \times C&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Low time}=0.69 \times R_2 \times C&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Mark-space ratio}=\frac{R_1}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Mini-astable==

This astable uses fewer components than the basic astable, and requires only the IC, one resistor and one capacitor, plus the Pin 5 capacitor for final versions.

[[Image:555 Mini Astable Diagram.svg|300px|center]]

This astable has a MSR of approximately 1:1, but this tends to increase under heavy current load, as the output does not swing fully to the power supply. This astable is not a reliable source of frequency, and should never be used where an accurate, stable clock is needed.

===Design equations===

::&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{0.72}{R_1\times C}&lt;/math&gt;. 

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{High time}=\mbox{Low time}=0.69 \times R_1 \times C&lt;/math&gt;

==Pin 4 Enable==
Pin 4 is normally held high, and in this state it does nothing. However, when Pin 4 is brought low, the 555 is disabled, and the output is held low. This can be used to turn an astable on when desired. An example of this is the [[Practical_Electronics/Astables/Double Astable|double-astable bleeper]], which uses the output from one astable to enable another, faster astable.

Pin 8 should '''not''' be used as the enable pin, as this will draw all the current needed to run the device from the triggering circuit.

==Other astable circuits==

*[[Practical_Electronics/Frequency Modulation/555|Frequency Modulation]]
*[[Practical_Electronics/Astable/Diminishing Frequency|Diminishing Frequency]]

==Units of Design Equations==

The units that the components values and frequency are measure in are the standard base units: ohms, farads and hertz. This are often inconvenient, as the value for componets are usually several orders of magnitude away from the base unit. It is possible to use more conveninet units to calculate the frequency, and the common combinations are given below:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Resistance!!Capacitance!!Period!!Frequency
|-
|&amp;Omega;||F||s||Hz
|-
|M&amp;Omega;||&amp;mu;F||s||Hz
|-
|k&amp;Omega;||&amp;mu;F||ms||kHz
|}

This plugin consists of a single [[Practical_Electronics/Astables/555|555 Astable]]. This plugin is very versatile, and can be used for any number of things, but it often is used to give a clock to run a circuit. The plugin below gives a pulse of about 2Hz with a very low mark-space ratio. The circuit diagram is given below.

[[image:555_Mk-sp_Diagram.svg|center|300px]]

This circuit obeys the following formulae with regards to its frequency and mark space ratio.

::&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{1.44}{\left( R_1 + R_2 \right)\times C}&lt;/math&gt;. 

::''This is different to the [[Practical_Electronics/Astables/555#Design equations|design equation]] for the standard 555 Astable. (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; instead of 2R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)'' 

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{High time}=0.69 R_1 \times C&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{High time}=0.69 R_2 \times C&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Mark-space ratio}=R_{ms}=\frac{R_1}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

The values below give a frequency of about 2Hz, with a mark-space ratio of about 1:50.

The stripboard layout is as shown below with a component list.

{|align=center
|[[Image:555_Mk-sp_Stripboard.svg|center|300px]]
|
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Ref.!!Component
|-
|IC1||555 Timer IC
|-
|R1||10K Resistor
|-
|R2||330K Resistor
|-
|C1||2.2&amp;mu;F Capacitor
|-
|D1||1N4148 Signal Diode
|}
|}

==Variations==

===Enable pin===

To give this plugin an enable pin, replace the wire link from Pin 4 to +V with a 10K resistor going from Pin 4 to ground (Pin 1). Then add a header pin to Pin 4. A high signal on this pin will cause the astable to function, a low will disable it, locking the output low.

== Request project notice ==

I request that a project notice (box at the top) be created about the changes to the general discussion (regarding proposals) or about [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Proposals#Proposal to change the icon and definition of &quot;tranwiki&quot; at the RfDs|my proposal]], since most people will not have the new location on their watch list. Thanks.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:24, 14 July 2010 (UTC)

:[[Image:Yes_check.svg|15px| ]] '''Done'''''-ish''. I have updated the notice so that it announces the reorganization of the reading rooms and invites editors to join in the discussion about proposals.  A project notice about the icons used at the RfD seemed a little out of place to me, so I hope this more generic announcement is satisfactory. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 11:15, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

::I'm sorry but you seem to have made a grammatical mistake. 'All discussions' should be a third person plural which means there should be no 's' after 'take'. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 11:34, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

::: Why are you sorry!  Well done and thank you. I have corrected it now, let me know if you spot any other mistakes. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 11:53, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

:: Thanks, even if I don't see it (using classic skin here). In any case stating that my proposal is about icons is the same as stating that the barnstar proposal is about finding a solution for the project lack of participation.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 12:23, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

:::Maybe people don't participate because there's no sense of community with few developing WikiProjects to join together collaborators, a hostility toward personalizing one's user page with userboxes, and no feel-good awards for people to give each other for helping to improve the collective state of the project. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:27, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

::::The first one is intrinsic to the project nature, I don't think that it is fixable in a consistent way and the few we are the more difficult it will be to turn it around from inside. For the rest I disagree with your view point, I've heard people stating that they don't like them and don't need them (a sentiment that I share) but I haven't noticed anyone objecting against the liberty of others to pimp their user pages how they see fit. Did I miss something ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 12:39, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

:::: Maybe Wikibooks needs to develop its own personality to give people a sense of community. Maybe that is why few develop WikiProjects, use userboxes, and suggest rewards. How about BookClubs instead of WikiProjects? How about bookboxes instead of userboxes? Medals have already been discussed as a possible alternative to barn stars. The theme seems to learn more towards developing our own approaches and not simply copying what Wikipedia has done.
:::: A WikiProject is a way to bring together participants that work on related articles, but all those Wikipedia articles are part of a single work. Wikibooks has multiple works, so Wikibooks would benefit from a different approach, one that involves taking into account that Wikibooks already has book-level participation and discussions without WikiProjects. A book club discussions many books, which would be a level above book-level discussions.
:::: User boxes on Wikipedia seem to often be random and unrelated to Wikipedia in some way. I guess maybe some people at Wikibooks feel that userboxes should have some purpose. The babel boxes let people know what languages a person knows. Book boxes could let people know what kind of books people read and might be able to help with. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:59, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

:::::Borrowing certain things from Wikipedia lowers the barrier to entry for encouraging people who edit there to contribute here as well.  You can have userboxes that describe a book as Xerol describes below.  [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Languages|WikiProject Languages]] is an example of how a WikiProject can have a scope unique to the project it is on. WikiProjects are not Wikipedia-specific. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:24, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

::::::I wonder if there's a way to facilitate inter-wiki groups, perhaps on meta. It might require a bit of micromanagement (especially at first if people don't have SULs set up) but that might ''really'' get people involved. In the case of the languages project, people on wikibooks would collaborate with people on wikipedia and wiktionary to get all the appropriate pages up to date with information that's both relevant inter- and intra-project. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 20:46, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

:::::::[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] had gotten interwiki WikiProjects stated as the best possibility when he went to Wikipedia to recruit for Wikibooks.  People complained about the lack of an interwiki watchlist, however.  There is a proposed WikiProject to foster such collaboration: [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Proposals/Cross-wiki collaboration]].   &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:07, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

:::::::[[User:Duplode|Duplode]]'s spirit also inspiried me to go project specific, but to no real avail.  If your curious the conversation is archived [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Mathematics/Archive_61#Call_to_Arms_for_Wikipedia.27s_sister_projects here]. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 21:18, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

:::::Seems to me like one of the easiest ways to combine a few approaches is to have userbox-type boxes for particular books they've contributed to on more than a minor scale. Of course it's not really that enforcable so if someone wants to put on their page that they're a major contributor to a Quantum Physics book when they don't even know what a proton is we can't do much about it. (I guess we ''could'', but it's effort that could be much better used elsewhere.) On a higher level, a way for contributors to groups of related books to congregate and collaborate would be nice. I could see groups for Mathematics, Languages, Physical Sciences, etc. forming and encouraging cross-book collaboration would also go a long way to having more polished works on WB. &lt;small&gt;Quick note, I know books are supposed to be largely independent from each other but I personally find it difficult to look at two books in one subject area (but different subjects) that are completely different in presentation.&lt;/small&gt; I can't find it now but I also seem to remember there being some kind of vandal patrol group years back (2005 or so), a couple groups like that for various cleanup tasks (RC patrol, reviewers, [[User:Xerol/Cleanup|war on orphans]], to name a few) would perhaps get more people on board with those tasks. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 13:10, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

::::::That group's still there, at [[WB:CVU]]. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:35, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

== Moved existing photo to the commons, and updated it their ==

I moved wikibooks:Jeepbody1.png to wikimedia:Jeepbody1.png, so i could upload a new version with step numbers to match the text. I tried to use the commons helper tool, but it seemed unable to do the task; but it gave me the templates I needed to put in to the commons version of it. 

I've marked the one here at wikibooks with \{\{nowcommons\}\} and am wondering if I need to do anything further in order to have the original removed, and have the one at the commons become visible here? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pearts|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:I have deleted it for you, so you should be able to see the Commons version here now.  You may have to flush your cache though. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 10:13, 20 July 2010 (UTC)

:yes, It is now visible from the book page. thanks! [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 12:38, 20 July 2010 (UTC)

::If you want to use CommonsHelper to move to Commons directly, you need to sign up for at [http://toolserver.org/~magnus/tusc.php?language=commons&amp;project=wikimedia TUSC] account.  Otherwise you can only copy the templates and have to upload manually.  Alternatively, you can make a request here and I'll prioritize it over my other efforts to push files to Commons. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:42, 20 July 2010 (UTC)

::I did sign up for a TUSC account, but commons helper kept complaining that the image did not have a compatable license to permit moving it to the commons.. I tried to add a more recient template to it, but the commons helper did not find what it was looking for. Any ideas on what is missing? [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 18:26, 20 July 2010 (UTC)

:::Somehow CommonsHelper has been adjusted for our templates here, despite differences in usage between here and Commons.  The Blender 3D screenshots, for instance, use {{tlx|free screenshot|license{{=}}GPL}}, while they have to be changed to use {{tlx|free screenshot|template{{=}}GPL}} at Commons.  I see you put the latter on the page before the move.  The former is what will appear valid to CommonsHelper. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:39, 20 July 2010 (UTC)

==Original research==
I'm afraid that it is [[WB:NOR|against our policy]] to have books that incorporate original research.  [[Westron]] by your description is including information on a constructed language that is not verifiable (made up by yourself).  If it were to only discuss the version of the language by Tolkien, that would not be a problem.  If you would like to find out more, please see [[Wikibooks:Original research]].  If you wish to create a language learning resource that does not find itself subject to these concerns, [[v:|Wikiversity]] allows original research.  Thank you for your consideration. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:19, 7 August 2010 (UTC)</text>

II Kings 4:42 - 5:19;  Mark 1:40-45; Mark 5:1-43
Matthew 8:1-4; Matthew 11:2-6;  

This week’s Torah portion is devoted to the topic of what makes a person clean or unclean.
It details some very interesting commandments that many are ignorant of, both in Christianity and the Messianic  movement.  This portion deals with two things: 

(1) the uncleanness of a woman after giving birth,and 

(2) what is to be done with those who have 'leprosy'.  

The commandments relating to women after birth primarily deal with ritual uncleanness and the commandments relating to lepers deal with how it is to be determined whether or not someone has leprosy and to how it can be  determined if one is healed from leprosy.  This Torah portion discusses things that are not commonly talked about in religious circles today.  Anything related to bodily functions is not discussed  in modern assemblies and since leprosy is not common in the Western world,  many seem to think that it is irrelevant.  But even if most of us will not have leprosy in our physical bodies, we can still be &quot;spiritual&quot; leper s and need healing from the Master. 

When times of natural uncleanness come, we are to avoid touching anything which is holy.  Once again we must connect with the spiritual implications of what is being taught.  If we can follow the format of what is given here is this portion of scripture, we can come to a much clearer understanding of what Yahweh expects of us.


&lt;u&gt;Purification After Child Birth&lt;/u&gt;

The Parsha addresses the subject of a woman who goes from a state of purity to impurity by giving birth.  
Parenthood is Yahweh' will for man and woman to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth.  Childbirth is a blessed event, and the Rabbis put great emphasis on the preparation for it, understanding that the reason this instruction was given after the instruction regarding what was clean and unclean food is because of the importance of what a mother eats during pregnancy in relation to the health and well-being of her child. The Torah is teaching that the parents' obligation to a child does not begin after he is born, but while he is still in his mother's womb. The pregnant mother must be careful of what she eats, because it can have a positive or negative effect on the child, depending on whether the food is kosher or not.

For Hebrew women, the gestation time was to be spent in prayer and spiritual preparation for herself and the future of the child and the task of motherhood to follow. The time of her 'uncleanness afterward also gave opportunity for seclusion so as to give time for mother and child to bond, apart from the physical necessity for this separation.

One of life's greatest joys in parenthood is to conceive and give birth to a new life and childbirth is a blessed event.  However, the discharges associated with childbirth were to be treated as unclean.

Uncleanness does not indicate we are rejected by God.  The woman's uncleanness after having a child has no bearing on whether or not she is personally acceptable in God’s sight.  Neither is there a difference in the sex of the child.  So why would Yahweh tell us that a woman is unclean after having had a child?  
One of the reasons involved in this time of separation is because Yahweh knows women need time with their children after giving birth.  This frees them from religious practices so that proper bonding with the child can occur.  Had He not given this instruction for mothers, they would feel obligated to continue their strict observance of rules (under the old system) and worship.  Since they are unclean, they are not required to maintain normal observance.

While females need more time to bond with their mothers, they mature much faster than boys.  The unclean state for a female child is twice as long as for males but this is not a sign of any inferiority of female to male, but is related to differences in their physical and emotional constitutions.  This time does allow for the mother to have the needed time with her child to develop healthy relationships at birth.   The mother's time of separation was intended to be a time of renewal through prayer, consecration, and dedication of the newborn's life back to Yahweh.

The need for separation was necessitated by the emission of blood after the birth which is part of the evidence of the curse that resulted from the fall and to also allow time for the body to heal and be restored.
Pain and labour were pronounced upon childbirth which should otherwise be a joy of bringing new life to birth.    We are told in the new covenant that women will be saved from this aspect if &quot;they continue in faith, love and holiness&quot;

The need to offer a sacrifice no longer applies as Yeshua is our offering for sin, once for all.  1 Timothy 2:15;  Hebrews 10:10
Children are born in the sinful fallen state from Adam's sin and need to come to their own acceptance of redemption and the reality of eternal death and accept the redemption of Messiah Yeshua.

If we say that we have no sin, we are misleading ourselves, and the truth is not in us, I John 1:8.   
The Psalmist's words in Psalms 51:5 applied here says, &quot;Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.&quot;  The uncleanliness associated with childbearing expresses the truth that the newborn child needs a Saviour.

This period of impurity following the birth of a child is both physical and spiritual.
The physical emissions of blood during this period rendered unclean to come into the temple and is consistent with all the other instructions for bodily emissions, and the body needs to become clean before being presented before His Presence again.

On the spiritual side, birth has taken place under the curse that was pronounced upon Eve is still operating and in a state of sin (not the personal sin of those involved) the woman brings forth another being who is also a sinner.   (Romans 5:12)  For this reason she is required to offer a sin offering.  (12:6)

This does not redeem the soul of the child, but is to atone for him being born under Adam's curse so that the blessings of the covenant can come upon him until he is of age to enter into the covenant by his own choice.
Yeshua's atonement did away with all sacrifices, so that this offering as well as all the other offerings are included in His once -for-all offering for our sins.

The initial impurity period, and the following pure state, are double for a female birth than for a male birth and this could relate to the fact that the female body is more susceptible to the effects of the curse.  (Genesis 3:16)


&lt;u&gt;The Laws of Uncleanness&lt;/u&gt;

Our portion discusses, in great detail, the laws of one affected by the skin disease called Tzara’at, translated 'leprosy'   This is not leprosy as we know it today termed &quot;Hansen's disease&quot;, but related to any skin eruption that was 'unclean'. 

The KJV says leprosy, but this is a mistranslation.  The rabbis teach (and so does Matthew Henry in his commentary) that these skin disorders &quot;[were] a plague often inflicted immediately by the hand of God&quot;  (M.H. Concise Commentary, page. 111).   

Hebraic understanding on this,  interprets this affliction as something which is spiritual in origin  (Arachin 15 a-b), and as such is a Divine warning that the afflicted person has acted sinfully.  The leprosy discussed in the Torah is a form of punishment meted out to those guilty of secret sin, lashon hara - evil talk being the most common (Arachin 15b).

The rabbis (and Matthew Henry) understand that the word used here tzarat is uncleanness that comes as a result of sin and therefore link leprosy and evil speaking. They teach that the skin disorder mentioned in this Torah portion is a result of sins of the mouth such as slander, gossip, murder with the mouth, false oaths and pride as well as sexual immorality, robbery, and selfishness.  For proof of this the rabbis cite the similarity between the Hebrew word for skin disorder (m'tzora) and the word one who spreads slander (motzeyra).  They say that these skin disorders are &quot;Divine retribution for the offender's failure to feel the needs and share the hurt of others.  Yahweh rebukes this antisocial behavior by isolating him from society, so that he can experience the pain he has imposed on others and heal himself through repentance&quot; (Artscroll Chumash, page 610).  

The remedy was also intended to be a cure - being separated from the community and alone gives one time to meditate and seek Yahweh for the healing of the problem, which needs repentance and restitution to the person or persons wronged. That there are two chapters here which deal with it, show its importance. 
Miriam  was afflicted with leprosy as a judgement for speaking against Moshe in Numbers chapter 12.   

This is an act of the loving hand of Yahweh, a judgment-unto-repentance, to bring you, out of sin and back to him. 

It would be well for us to pause at this moment and to consider our own behavior with respect to our tongue.  As we get closer to the end of the age and the return of Messiah it is likely that Yahweh will begin to require greater spiritual accountability of His people.   He wants to instill within people the true fear of Yahweh God and a repentant and contrite heart, and to turn people away from lukewarmness.  May the Holy Spirit help us that we not sin with our tongue, that we hold ourselves accountable and responsible and that we walk in the fear of God at all times.

Next time you have an ailment, a trial, a setback, some problem in life, before ascribing its occurrence simply to time and chance reflect for a moment and consider: perhaps, you are reaping the consequences for something that you have sown?  Is there a sin in your life which you have not confessed and for which you have not repented?  Is He trying to get your attention?  In the case of sickness it could be as simple as your not eating the right foods, not getting enough exercise or enough rest.  Or it could be gossip, slander, bitterness, unforgiving or anger,  violating some of Yahweh's Torah commands which you know you should be keeping.


&lt;u&gt;The Leper&lt;/u&gt;

“As for the leper who has the infection, his clothes shall be torn,and the hair of his head shall be uncovered, and he shall cover his moustache and  cry, “Unclean! Unclean!’ He shall remain unclean all the days during which he has the infection; he is unclean.  He shall live alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp. “    Vayikra/Leviticus13:45-46 

What a tragic predicament, to be considered unclean, defiled and required to dwell alone.  Lepers had no choice in the matter.  Their very presence invoked fear from those who saw them. The one who  was discovered to be a leper was to have his clothes and hair removed, as they might contain infection and he was to declare himself unclean.  Then he was to go and live outside the camp.  Leprosy in ancient times was not something you wanted to get.  Few people recovered from it and according to the Torah, Yahweh specified certain commandments to get lepers out of the assembly.  

Sin is like leprosy and makes a person unclean, with the major exception of the sinner having a choice.  The true believers today must choose to separate from all forms of uncleanness from Yahweh’s perspective of what is unclean. Yahweh has always had trouble getting His people to separate themselves from ungodliness.  We make the choice to leave the righteous paths of Yahweh and even the most righteous can go so far astray that Yahweh considers them as unclean.

“But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousness are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.”   Isaiah 64:6 

Consider the path you are taking.  Yahweh’s heartfelt desire is for His people to return to fellowship with Him.  Sin separates us from Him and considering that all that falls short of His standard is sinful in His sight, we need a different perspective toward our lifestyle and what is acceptable in His sight to that which the world calls righteous or acceptable behaviour.

“For ALL have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God”    Romans 3:23 
The glory of God is Yahweh’s righteous standard of holiness which was originally imparted to man.

If we say that we have not sin, we are misleading ourselves, and the truth is not in us, I John 1:8

The righteous individuals of this generation know their lives depends upon continual Teshuva/repentance (return).  We all need to consider that our lives hang in the balance.  Are we repentant or not?
Only, the repentant person has the hope of being proclaimed clean.  Even King David knew the power of continual return.  After his sin with Bathsheeba he realized turning to Yahweh was the only way to rectify the situation.

“For You do not desire sacrifice; else I would give it: You do not delight in burnt offering. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise”    Psalm 51:16-17

Yeshua exemplified this.  Yeshua also desires us to have a broken and contrite heart as we approach Yahweh.  It is time to leave our uncleanness behind together with all justification of what we consider to be right, and turn toward Him with a repentant heart.
 
Just as leprosy is a terrible disease infecting the body, so does sin infect many other people in His Body.   For this reason we are told to pursue peace with people and holiness and to be careful of any root of bitterness that would spring up and cause trouble and thereby defile many.    Hebrews 12:14-16
What is interesting today is that many people who are “part” of the Body of Believers have leprosy and they don’t even know it.  Because, as a whole we are not astute in the Torah which is God’s instruction manual.   We cannot recognize sin when we see it.   Thus , we cannot diagnose spiritual lepers from the symptoms that are there to see.
Those who walk in sinful ways are being stripped naked before us and are leaving because of their choices of continuance in sin  -  that is, their continued violation of God’ s commandments. 

We need to learn to diagnose sin in our midst.  Just as the priests were to know how to diagnose lepers

Who are engineers and what do they do? Why are the activities of engineers important? In this section, we will begin to discover some answers to these questions.

==Some Practicing Engineers==
{{Robox|theme=8|title=Activity}}
What do you already know about engineering and engineers? Imagine an engineer at work. (You might want to get out a paper and something to write with.) What does the engineer look like? What is the engineering wearing? Where is the engineer working, and what are they doing? What does the engineer spend most of the day doing? What sorts of tools is the engineer using to help with their work? Is the engineer working alone or with others?

Capture your ideas by making a list of your answers to the questions above, or by drawing a picture of the engineer that you are imagining. When you are finished share your drawing or list with someone else. How are your lists or pictures similar? How are they different?

Continue imagining your engineer and add to your drawing or list. What sort of education does your engineer have? What sorts of classes did they take in college? What does the engineer do very well, and what does the engineer not do well? Does your engineer have an area of specialization? If so, what? How much money does your engineer make in a given year? Now share the expanded version of your engineer with someone else, and once again discuss the similarities and differences.

As we progress though the chapter, we will check to see if your ideas change.
{{Robox/Close}}

Now that you have envisioned an engineer, let us look at some real-life profiles of practicing engineers. As you read each profile, note the attributes that you included in your picture or list and make a new list of the attributes that differ from your picture or list.

===Profile 1===
Ashley is in charge of product development and support for a large '''electronics''' product company in the Pacific Northwest. She manages two engineering teams. She is 39 years old and likes living in the Pacific Northwest because of the outdoor activities such as hiking and camping. The members of her engineering teams live in other cities and most of them live outside the United States in countries that include India, China, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia. Each location has some particular engineering advantage. For example, the United States is the best place to design products and manage product development and support; India has a very good system to support technology development and it is less expensive to develop software there; China was selected as the best place to manufacture computer chips; and Malaysia and Sri Lanka were selected to manufacture and assemble the rest of the products.

Most days Ashley works out of her home. Because her engineering team members are located all over the world, she must be available to communicate with them 24 hours a day or whenever a problem arises. To aid this global communication, Ashley's computer sounds a bell any time one of her team members sends important email or needs to talk with her directly. Since she is available 24 hours a day, her daily routine is very flexible. Ashley can usually choose her own work schedule, except when she has scheduled meetings or urgent communication demands, which might be only two or three times each week. Sometimes she spends the morning working in her garden after handling some of her morning communication (the bell also rings outside), and she also takes a break to paint most afternoons. Ashley travels to each of the team member locations one or two times each year.

Ashley's most important tools are her computer and her mobile phone. She has excellent communication skills and knows how to relate to the different cultures of her team members. Ashley also has a broad knowledge of electronic product systems. Although she is not an expert in any of the individual components, she understands how each of the components works together (Figure 1).

[[File:Navy-Radome.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 2.1''': One of Ashley's projects might include developing components that will be part of a satellite antenna system such as this one at the Cryptologic Operations Center in Misawa, Japan.]]

Ashley was in college for four and one-half years studying for her engineering degree. She spent the first year at a community college before transferring to a university. Ashley liked math in high school but did not settle on an engineering major until she was in her junior year of college and had to use math to analyze and design an electronics project. Her favorite courses were those that explained how electronic devices worked. Ashley earned $90,000 in 2006.

Tyson loved cars and motorcycles since he was very young; he began working on them while he was still too young to drive. His dream has always been to design cars and motorcycles. When he graduated from high school he found that his high school grades, and especially his math background, were not good enough to be admitted to a university engineering program. He worked while taking evening courses at a community college for two years before transferring into a university engineering program. Tyson found his physics courses interesting, but struggled with math. Tyson studied engineering for another four years before he graduated with an engineering degree. In school, he learned that there were very few job opportunities to actually design cars and motorcycles. However, Tyson had done a senior project using a '''rapid prototyping (RP)''' machine. The RP machine could automatically build almost any part that Tyson could design on a computer. He learned to create many different types of part designs on the computer using what is called computer-aided design (CAD) software. With this software Tyson could make dimensional drawings, and he spent many extra hours in the lab designing and using the RP machine to make his designs (Figure 2). After graduation, he took a job in Texas with a rapid prototyping company. Soon Tyson found that the rapid prototyping technology could be used to make expensive specialty parts, and he began working with motorcycle designers in Italy and Spain. He also found a NASCAR racing team that needed custom parts and worked with their designers.

[[File:Cad crank.jpg|frame|center|'''Figure 2.2''': This piston assembly was designed using CAD software similar to the one Tyson used.]]

After eight years, Tyson decided to start his own company designing and producing high-end custom motorcycle and car parts. He now lives in California and owns two sports cars and a motorcycle. Tyson, 43, earned $285,000 in 2006. He travels out of town and out of the country two or three times a month. His most important tools are his computer that has very good CAD software and his mobile communication system. Tyson enjoys listening to his music collection while he works.

Raji's childhood dream was to be a dolphin trainer. She really loved biology and chemistry classes in high school, but was undecided about her college major. A guest speaker in her high school biology class described how engineers were combining biology and technology to develop new technologies that could one day help blind people see; the speaker encouraged Raji to consider an engineering career. With her good grades, she received a college scholarship that paid for her tuition, room and board.

[[File:Army prosthetic.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 2.3''': Bioengineers help design prosthetic limbs that allow amputees to live a more active life.]]

Raji earned a bioengineering degree in four years, and her favorite courses were those that included time in the bioengineering labs. In her junior year of college, because of her good grades and careful lab work, she received an invitation to work with a team of students and professors on a research project designing prosthetic limbs for amputees (Figure 3). Raji found that she really liked research. After graduating with a bachelor's degree, she decided to go to graduate school for a PhD. Raji, now 28, will complete her PhD degree next year and hopes to work for a bioengineering company as a research engineer. She has also considered teaching at a university. Raji likes to ski and plans to begin scuba diving. Maybe Raji will finally get to swim with the dolphins.

===Profile 4===
Xaio grew up in Taiwan and studied many hours every day while in high school so he would be accepted into a regional college. He was very interested in how computers work and wanted to learn to design them, so he studied computer engineering in college. Xaio knew that he would be able to find a job when he finished school, but most of the jobs for computer engineers in his home region did not pay as well as similar jobs in other countries. In fact, some of the job opportunities in other countries paid more money in one year than Xaio's family made in ten years. However, such a high paying job would require a master's degree from a good school in another country, and that would be expensive. Xaio applied to schools in the United States and in Great Britain and was accepted to a good school in the United States, where he finished a master's degree in computer engineering in two years.

Xaio has been working for an electronics design company in the United States for five years. Because of his knowledge of Taiwanese culture and language, and his knowledge of electronics design, the design company trained him in '''microelectronics''' manufacturing and testing. Now Xaio is a team leader for manufacturing some of the company's designs that are being made in Taiwan (Figure 4). He travels to Taiwan about four times a year. His hobbies include tennis and ballroom dancing. Xaio made $85,000 in 2006.

Glenn had many interests growing up; he played on a soccer team for several years, and played trumpet in his grade school and junior high bands. In high school, he was good at math and science, but he also enjoyed playing trumpet in the marching band and competing on the swim team. As a junior in high school, he had a very difficult time deciding what his college major should be; he liked many different things, and was not sure which he wanted to pursue. Several of his teachers suggested that he consider engineering, and after visits to several colleges, he decided electrical engineering appealed to him. He started as a college freshman in electrical engineering. One year later, he decided that mechanical engineering was a better fit for his interests; he switched to mechanical engineering and graduated with a B+ grade average three and one-half years later.

After graduation, he was hired by a large aerospace company whose primary business is Department of Defense contracts. The company provided a one-year training period in which he rotated through several different divisions of the company and became familiar with the different product lines within the company. Now he works as a member of a large team updating engine and transmission designs for a military helicopter. He enjoys the technical challenges of his job. He plans to improve his technical expertise by starting a masters program in the next few years. He believes that this will help him move into a team leadership position.

==Engineering is Diverse and Global==
Now that you have read the profiles of several different engineers and made a list of their attributes, have any of your original ideas about engineers changed? What have you discovered about engineers and engineering?

Hopefully, you have noticed that engineers are as diverse as the types of careers they pursue. They are women and men, young and old. They are '''consultants''', teachers, and technical sales representatives. They work for small companies and large companies. Many start their own companies. They work in industrial plants and research labs. Some engineers work in an office; some work in production and manufacturing facilities; others spend most of their time working outdoors. And some engineers do a great deal of travel.

Engineers need a college degree, and many choose to acquire advanced specialization by pursuing a master's or PhD degree. Others choose to pursue an engineering degree because it provides them with both a solid technical background and strong critical thinking skills that support them in other fields such as law, medicine, business, and public service.

You may have also noticed that engineers can make a good income, that they often work in teams, and that those teams are composed of people from around the world. In the past ten years engineering has become a global career.

{{Robox|theme=8|title=Activity}}
(For this exercise you need access to the Internet or a library.) Approximately 75,000 students graduated from engineering colleges in the United States following the 2005–2006 academic year. See if you can find out how many engineering graduates there were from other countries. Which countries have the most engineering graduates? Can you guess why?

Engineers solve problems using math, science, and technology. They also design products that are useful for humans. To become an engineer you need a degree in engineering that will provide you with a broad background in math, science, and technology, as engineers use these skills to solve problems on a daily basis. Besides the broad background, engineering students also choose a specialization in some branch of engineering. Engineers in each branch have knowledge and skills that can be applied to many fields and can contribute to solving many different types of problems. Since many engineering projects encompass multiple problems to solve, engineers in one field often work closely with specialists in other fields, including scientists, other engineers, and business leaders.

==Engineering Specializations==
Most engineering specializations have emerged over the past 200 years as scientific knowledge in various fields has grown. Prior to that, engineering focused primarily on the construction of roads, bridges, canals, or military structures and devices.

{{Robox|theme=8|title=Activity}}
To better understand the breadth of engineering specializations it is time to make another list. This time you do not need to do any research. Simply make a list of all of the engineering specializations or types of engineers you can think of, and write a brief description of one of those specializations. Refer to the [[#Major Engineering Societies|list of engineering societies]] that represent different engineering specializations at the end of this lesson. How many were you able to name? Are there others that you did not write down? Was your description of the engineering specialization similar to the description listed? You may want to spend some time reading all of the descriptions to better understand the various engineering specializations.

{{Robox|theme=8|title=Activity}}
Now that you are familiar with some of the different engineering specializations and the major societies that represent engineering, let us see if you can match an engineering design project with an engineering specialization.

An aircraft manufacturer wants to design and manufacture the world's largest airplane. What type of engineer(s) should they hire?

From reading the [[#Major Engineering Societies|list of engineering specializations]] at the end of the lesson, your first response might be an aerospace engineer. However, did you know that there are miles of electrical wiring and thousands of electronic devices inside of an airplane such as the Airbus A380 shown in Figure 5? Therefore, it might be a good idea to hire an engineer with some knowledge of electrical systems (perhaps an electrical engineer). We probably do not want the aircraft to break into pieces under the weight of the hundreds of people or thousands of pounds of cargo inside the aircraft, so it might be a good idea to hire structural engineers or civil engineers. Today there are thousands of different materials that can be used to manufacture products so we might want to hire engineers with specialized knowledge of materials (materials engineer). Pilots need to be able to operate the very specialized equipment that controls an airplane, so you might want to hire engineers who specialize in human-computer interaction (industrial engineer). It might also be a good idea to hire systems engineers who have specialized knowledge of how the different parts of the aircraft (mechanical, electrical, structural, materials, human-computer interaction) fit and work together.

==Engineering Skills==
Many employers hire engineers because of particular skills, and not because of a particular discipline, degree, or specialization. Let us explore the range of engineering skills and educational degrees that employers look for in their employees. Job advertisements usually describe a position and list the skills, experience, and education required or desired for the position. Engineering skills can be highly technical, and may include the ability to use certain types of math and science, the ability to use certain types of instruments, the ability to operate certain types of computer programs, or the ability to apply certain areas of specialized engineering knowledge.

{{Robox|theme=8|title=Activity}}
At the end of the lesson you will find several [[#Sample Engineering Job Opportunities|engineering job advertisements]] that were posted on the Internet in 2007. As you read them, you may notice terms that are new or unfamiliar to you, particularly if the ad is describing a specialized technical skill. You may also see terms that you do understand. Read each of the job descriptions and requirements carefully. Make a list of the degree requirements for each position, the experience required for each position, and the skill requirements that you understand. Did you notice that an engineering degree was listed as a requirement in all three ads? You might have also noticed that none of the positions required a specific engineering specialization.
{{Robox/Close}}

About half of all engineering job advertisements today do not require a discipline-specific engineering degree. Rather they require an engineering degree coupled with a set of specific skills or experience.

Two of the ads list a desired number of years of experience, and all of the ads list specific types of experience. Below you will find one example from each of the ads.

* '''Ad 1''': Experience in managing complex, high-profile projects.
* '''Ad 2''': Familiarity or experience in one or more of the following areas: product development, program management, imaging and printing.
* '''Ad 3''': Experience in injection molding plastics.

Experience is a very important qualification for most engineering jobs. Many engineering students gain experience while they are in school through internships and/or through part-time employment. Others gain employment experience after school and progress to new positions as they gain more experience.

Let us now look at some of the engineering skills with which you are probably more familiar. Did you notice that all three ads require good communication skills?

* '''Ad 1''': Demonstrates strong communication skills by clearly documenting activities and presenting information, technical content and ideas through spoken and written words; listens well.
* '''Ad 2''': Good communication skills.
* '''Ad 3''': Strong communication skills with the ability to initiate establish and maintain positive relationships with internal and external customers. Clean, accurate, precise work, and documentation.

Engineers must be able to communicate their ideas to others. Engineers often make presentations, write technical reports, and interact with customers and other technical experts.

One of the ads uses the following words: &quot;clean, accurate, precise work, and documentation&quot;. Many engineers keep detailed notebooks of their work. This helps them remember how they solved a problem, or why they chose to design a product a certain way. Do you think the Wright Brothers kept good notes while they were trying to design the world's first airplane? They recorded every experiment, every failure, and every success. Sometimes engineering notes are used to apply for patents that can be quite valuable. Sometimes engineers must defend their designs when problems occur. Why do you think it would be important to have engineering notes and documentation in the case of an engineering failure, such as the collapse of a bridge or a building? One answer is that notes and documentation help engineers find the causes of failure, which ultimately leads to improved designs.  Another answer is that good documentation can protect engineers against lawsuits.

All three ads also required good organizational skills.

* '''Ad 1''': Defines and prioritizes realistic, specific goals; able to complete scheduled tasks in the face of changing priorities.
* '''Ad 2''': Good organizational skills, multitask ability, teamwork ability a must, self-directed.
* '''Ad 3''': Detail-oriented, strong organization skills, time management (time lines), and deadline driven. Self-starter, motivated, and proactive.

Engineers frequently work on multiple projects simultaneously (multitasking), and most of those projects have different tasks and corresponding deadlines. Engineers also usually work with one or more teams simultaneously, where each team member has different skills and responsibilities. Task deadlines are critical to the success of most projects. Sometimes missing a deadline can cause an entire project to be cancelled, or may result in the loss of significant revenue. For example, imagine that you are on a team designing a new video game controller. If you do not finish the design, testing and manufacture of the product, your company may miss the holiday season in which the majority of product sales will occur. Or perhaps your company knows that another firm is also designing a new video game controller and that the first company to get their product to market is likely to acquire the most customers.

{{Robox|theme=14|title=Enrichment Activity (Medium)}}
Identify one or two engineering skills from the advertisements below that interest you, and do some research to explain the nature and details of that skill.
{{Robox/Close}}

One ad listed the following requirement:

:'''Ad 1''': Uses a logical, systematic approach to solving problems through analysis and evaluation of alternate solutions.

Engineers learn to solve problems using a careful systematic problem-solving approach. Note that the requirement also states, &quot;…and evaluation of alternative solutions&quot;. Usually, there is more than one solution to a problem.

{{Robox|theme=8|title=Activity}}
A fire has been burning in a coal mine for several years in the northeastern United States. As shown in Figures 6 and 7, the fire is completely underground; smoke rises through cracks in the ground in some areas and the ground has collapsed in several locations. There are many potential solutions to this problem: we could fill the mine with water; we could try to smother the fire by cutting off oxygen; or we could just let it burn.

[[File:Censign.jpg|500px|thumb|center|'''Figure 2.6''': A fire in an underground coal mine in Centralia, Pennsylvania, has been burning since 1962.]]

[[File:Pdr 1647.jpg|500px|thumb|center|'''Figure 2.7''': Smoke rising up through cracks in the pavement caused by the intense heat of
the fire burning below.]]

There are many possible solutions to most problems, and in order to ensure the best solution is selected it is important that engineers evaluate each and every alternative. In the situation above, which of the solution to the mine fire do you think would cost the most? Which solution would cause the most harm to the environment or to the people that live in the area? Which solution is most likely to actually put out the fire? These are the sorts of questions engineers must answer to arrive at an optimal solution. The solution that was actually chosen for the mine fire was to let the fire continue to burn.

==Engineering Education==
In 2006 there were approximately 350 engineering colleges or schools in the United States and Canada. There are hundreds more in other countries. Most engineering colleges or schools have multiple engineering programs that offer degrees in different engineering specializations. For example, Arizona State University (ASU) in Tempe and Mesa, Arizona, offers the following 12 engineering and engineering technology degrees. In addition, within many of these degrees are specialized concentrations or focus areas.

* Aerospace Engineering
* Bioengineering
* Chemical Engineering
* Civil and Environmental Engineering
* Computer Engineering
* Electrical Engineering
* Electronics Engineering Technology
* Engineering (multidisciplinary)
* Industrial Engineering
* Manufacturing Engineering Technology
* Mechanical Engineering
* Mechanical Engineering Technology

Engineering programs are usually accredited by an organization outside of the university. Accreditation is like a stamp of approval, indicating that the engineering program has been evaluated, and that it meets standards for a quality process, adequate resources, and an appropriate engineering curriculum. The largest accreditation organization for engineering programs is ABET. In 2007, ABET accredited more than 2,700 different programs in engineering, technology, applied science, and computing.

ABET requires that all engineering programs demonstrate that their students attain the outcomes shown below. These outcomes are quite general, and are needed by almost any engineer. In addition to these outcomes, there are specific outcomes required by each engineering discipline. Thus, electrical engineering students must demonstrate the ability to design complex electrical and electronic systems; mechanical engineering students must demonstrate the ability to design and realize thermal and mechanical systems. Finally, each engineering program may have outcomes that are specific to the program; for example, these outcomes may address the needs of companies or industries that hire the program's graduates. If you study engineering in an ABET-accredited program, you will spend part of your time pursuing each of these different outcomes.

# an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering;
# an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data;
# an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability;
# an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams;
# an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems;
# an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility;
# an ability to communicate effectively;
# the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context;
# a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning;
# a knowledge of contemporary issues;
# an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice.

To prepare to study engineering in college, you should get a good foundation in high school in math and science. Look at outcome number 1 (an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering). In most college engineering programs, students study chemistry, physics, higher math (either calculus or discrete mathematics), and possibly biology; so you need to be prepared to enter into college-level study in these areas. You will be best prepared if you take high school courses in all of these areas. In addition, it is helpful if you are ready to start calculus while in your first year in college.

Completing an engineering curriculum can be challenging and will probably require many hours of study outside of the classroom. Most undergraduate engineering programs are designed so that you can complete a bachelor's degree in four years. Because they were not well prepared in high school or do not stay on track as a full-time student, many students, however, take five or more years to complete their degrees.

Completing an engineering degree with good grades opens up many possible gratifying career paths. A engineering degree provides the foundation for the types of careers discussed in the profiles in the section &quot;[[../Discovering_Engineering#Some_Practicing_Engineers|Some Practicing Engineers]]&quot; of the previous lesson. Many graduates of engineering programs also move into technical sales or engineering management positions within the first ten years of their careers. In addition, an engineering degree provides an excellent starting point for graduate education. Many people with a bachelor’s degree in engineering choose to pursue a master's degree in an engineering specialization to gain advanced and deep knowledge. A bachelor's degree in engineering also provides a good foundation for an advanced degree in law, business, or even medicine.

Identify two different university engineering programs, preferably at different schools. Research the admission requirements and the classes you would be expected to take in the first two years of the program. How many of these courses are math, science, and engineering courses? See if you can identify the courses in each of these areas.

==Engineering Licensure==
Many engineers choose to become licensed as a professional engineer (PE). While licensure is not required for the majority of engineering careers, only licensed professionals are allowed to offer their services to the public and sign and seal plans for the public. Some engineers who are not required to hold a professional license choose to do so for other reasons; for example, some do it to demonstrate that they have accomplished a recognized standard. It may also be advantageous when seeking or changing employment opportunities, as the PE certification sets a candidate apart from other nonlicensed engineers.

The requirements for engineering licensure are determined by each state, and therefore vary somewhat from state to state. Despite the variations, there is a standard process. The first step is to graduate from an ABET-accredited engineering program. The second step is to take the engineering fundamentals exam (FE) that covers the fundamental engineering sciences that are studied in engineering school. The third step is to acquire experience through employment, the criteria for which varies from state to state. The final step is to take the engineering professional examination.

Material nodes look very similar to texture nodes, and indeed there is a fair amount of overlap in functionality. Some important differences are:

* Functions for performing spatial transformations (e.g. rotation and scaling) are only available for texture nodes.
* Functions for altering diffuse versus specular colours and rendering parameters, like translucency, are only available for material nodes.

==A Simple Graduated Material==
First of all, let’s set up a really basic modelling scene to show off the node-based material you’ll be creating in a moment.

Open a new Blender document, with the default cube, default light and default camera. Create a plane object. Rotate and position that so it lies behind the cube from the camera’s viewpoint. Scale the plane up to say, 4x, to form a decent-sized backdrop. Assign it a new default material, and a texture with some detail to it; I used a simple Marble with default settings, except under the “Map To” miniwindow I changed the colour to a medium grey from the default magenta, to stop it hurting my eyes.

Now select the cube. Scale it 3x in the Z-axis; the elongated proportions should show off a gradation more nicely. In the “Material” miniwindow, set the “Col” (diffuse) colour to white, and the alpha to zero. In the “Mirror Trans” miniwindow, turn on “Ray Transp” and set the “IOR” to some suitable refractive index, say 1.5 for glass.

Hit '''F12''' to do an initial render, just to confirm you’ve got everything nicely arranged.

[[Image:MaterialNodesRenderBefore.jpg]]

With the cube still selected, open the Node Editor. By default, the Material Nodes mode should already be selected, and the combo box should be showing the name of the material you assigned to the cube; select it if it’s not. Click the “Use Nodes” button, and immediately two node windows should appear, a Material one and Output one.

Click on the title of the Material node window, and use '''XKEY''' or '''DEL''' to get rid of it. Go to the “Add” menu, “Input” submenu, and add a new “Geometry” node. Also add a new “Extended Material” node. And from the “Convertor” submenu, a new “Separate RGB” node. In the middle of the Extended Material node window, there is a popup menu showing you the names of the materials in your document; select name of the material you previously assigned to the cube again.

Make sure there are no wires running between any of the nodes; now run one from the “Color” output terminal on the Material node to the “Color” input on the Output node, and one from the “Alpha” output on the former to the “Alpha” input on the latter.

Notice that, next to each of the input terminals in the Material window, there is either a field for entering a scalar value (grey terminals), or a button which pops up a little set of controls for letting you specify X, Y and Z components for a vector (blue terminals), or a colour swatch which pops up to let you pick a new colour (yellow terminals). This way, you don’t have to make connections to all the inputs, or indeed any of them; any unconnected inputs will be set to the constant value that you specify.

Anyway. connect a wire from the “Global” output of the Geometry node to the “Image” input of the Separate RGB node. “But geometry isn’t a colour!?” I hear you cry. But as explained on [[../Texture Nodes|Texture Nodes]], a vector is a vector. Feeding in a position instead of a colour to Separate RGB means its outputs are not the R, G and B components of the colour, but the X, Y and Z components of the position. So run another wire from the B (i.e. Z) output of Separate RGB to the Alpha input of the Extended Material window. The resulting layout should look like this:

Now you’re ready to render. But before hitting '''F12''', hit '''JKEY''' to switch render buffers. That way you still have the previous render to compare with. Once the render window comes up, you can hit '''JKEY''' to alternate between the two renders.

Here’s what my node example looked like (note I turned the energy of the lamp down to 0.5, otherwise it seemed too bright):

[[Image:MaterialNodesRenderAfter.jpg]]

Notice the gradation of transparency along the Z-axis, from fully transparent at the bottom to fully opaque at the top.

For added fun, try taking the material Alpha setting from the R or G outputs of the Separate RGB node instead, just to see the gradation orient along the X or Y axes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==U.S. GAAP and IFRS==


The transition from US GAAP to [[w:International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) affects the way one reports and accounts for information on financial statementsis. IFRS is already impacting business decisions.  Switching to IFRS will help eliminate the differences between companies financial statements which ultimately is a huge thing allowing better camparabilitiy among companies.  IFRS is principle based accounting, which simply means instead of a having a lot of rules to follow it is more broad with its concepts to guide the accountants.  The goal of a principle based system is to avoid numerous rules.  This makes it easier to go about your business more freely.  Comparing your company to another has always been important.  To see what you have to do to stay on top, and to actually know you are, through comparing is an important motivation.  IFRS will help make this more feasible, and hopefully encourage companies and motivate them along with their competitors now having a better understanding of where they stand.

==Some of the differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS==

Accounting for contingent losses is very similar between the two however IFRS is &quot;more likely than not&quot; as well as as &quot;probable&quot;.  IFRS requires reporting present values of estimated cash flows when the effect of time value of money is material whereas U.S. GAAP allows this when the timing of cash flows is fixed or reliably determinable.

Question 1: Under IFRS, if every amount in a range of contingent losses is equally likely the amount accrued is the?

Under, IFRS, not like U.S. GAAP, convertible debt is divided into its liability and equity elements.

Question 2:  Cost incurred in connection with the issuance of bond's and other debt, such as legal costs printing costs, and underwriting fees, are referred to as debt issuance costs.  Using IFRS:

a. transaction costs are recorded separately as an asset
b. we increase the recorded amount of the debt by the transaction costs
c. the increase i nthe effective interest rate is reflected in the interest expense
d. the decrease in the effective interest rate is reflected in the interest expense.

Under IFRS the rate used for leases is usually the rate implicit to discount the minimum lease payments.  However, under U.S. GAAP the lessor uses oen rate, the implicit rate, and the lessees use another, the incremental borrowing rate unless the other rate is lower.

Question 3:

When recording a capital lease Blue Company is aware that the implicit interest rate used by the Greay Company, the lessor, to calculate lease payments is 7%.  Blue's incremental borrowing rate is 6%.  Blue should record the leased asset and lease liability at the present value of the lease payments discounted at:

Question 4:  A lease is a capital lease if substantially all risks and rewards of ownership are transferred whether using U.S. GAAP or IFRS.  When making this determination less judgement, more specificity is applied using?

Question 5:  When the leaseback in a Sale-leaseback transaction is an operating lease, a company that prepares it's financial statements using IFRS:


As shown there are still similarities between U.S. GAAP and IFRS but as more and more companies transform over to IFRS it is important to know the differences in the way they account for things!

:All of the questions can be found in the Study Guide Volume 2 for Chapters 13-21, there also are more IFRS question for self-study within this book:





Answers:

1.  Mid point of the range
2. C
3. 7%, if using IFRS
4.  U.S. GAAP
5.  Immediately recognizes the gain on the sale

((A.Cunningham))



:''See [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Intermediate_Accounting Intermediate Accounting wikibook overview]''

The three major financial statements are: the Balance Sheet, the Income Statement, and the Statement of Cash Flows.

==Balance Sheet==
The balance sheet presented in the financial statements published by a firm provides summary information of the assets, liabilities, and shareholder equities of the firm.  There is much detail in subaccounts of the firm's accounting system which is not reported.  What is provided is summary in major account areas, and includes classification of short-term vs. long-term assets and liabilities.

==Income Statement==
The income statement presented in published financial statement is also summary.
Income Statement is the statement of operations or statement of earnings is used to summarize the profit generating activities that occurred during a particular period of time. The income statement consist of revenues and expenses.The income statement describes a company's revenue and expenses along with the resulting net income or loss over a period of time due to earning activities. 
   There are two ways in preparing an income statement. Single step income statement which is an easier approach. Using the simple step method, you total revenues and total expenses, then subtract the total revenue from the total expenses to arrive at the net income. The multi-step income statement is more complex than the single step. The multi-step method takes several steps to arrive at the net income.

Question 1
Prepare an income statement based on the following information: Service Revenue ,38000; Supplies Expenses,16000; Salaries Expense,12000; Miscellaneous Expenses, 7000.
                              Income Staement
Service Revenue           38000
Supplies Expenses        (16000)
Salaries Expenses        (12000)
Miscellaneous Expenses   (7000)
Net Income                3000

==Statement of Cash Flows==
The statement of cash flows provides a reconciliation between beginning vs. end balances of cash and cash equivalents of a firm, for the period of the income statement.  A categorization of cash flows by Operating vs. Investing vs. Financing cash flows has been adopted and is now part of required U.S. GAAP reporting.

SFAS #95
230-10-45-1

A statement of cash flows shall report the cash effects during a period of an entity's operations, its investing transactions, and its financing transactions.

The statement of cash flows lists all cash inflow and cash outflow during a reporting period.
It has three primary categories:

1.	Cash flows from operating activities

2.	Cash flows from investing activities

3.	Cash flows from financing activities

There are also two other categories

4.	The reconciliation of the net increase or decrease in cash with the change in the balance of the cash account.

5.	Noncash investing and financing activities.

'''Cash Flows from Operating Activities:'''

Includes inflows and outflows of cash that are from activities reported on the income statement. So, they are elements of the net income.
The cash outflows are when operational assets are acquired.
The cash inflows are when the assets are sold.
But, resale of the assets are reported as investing activities except the purchase and sale of inventory are reported as operating activities.
There are two different methods that can be used to report the cash flows of operating activities. There is the direct method and the indirect method.

''Direct Method'' is when each cash effect is reported directly.

''Indirect Method'' is when the cash effects are reported indirectly by beginning with reported net income and working backwards to convert the amount to cash basis.

In order to identify the inflows and outflows for operating activities you need to analyze the components of the income statement.

For example, in order to find out the cash inflow from customer we need to know the sales revenue, but the sales revenue is also affected by the account receivable account. So, if the sales revenue is 300 and the Accounts Receivable increases by 20 then the cash received from customers would be 280.

In order to determine the cash paid to suppliers you need to look at two accounts: inventory and accounts payable and then determine their effect on the cost of goods sold. For example, if the cost of goods sold was 220 and inventory increased by 7 and accounts payable decreased by 15 the cash paid to suppliers would be 242. You add 7 because the inventory increased and you add 15 because the accounts payable decreased, which means more money was paid.

The cash paid for interest is determined by the bond interest expense and discount on the bonds payable. For example, if the interest expense is $10 and the unamortized discount decreases by $3 then the cash paid for interest is $7.

'''Cash flows from investing activities:'''

SFAS #95
230-10-45-11

 Cash flows from purchases, sales, and maturities of available-for-sale securities shall be classified as cash flows from investing activities and reported gross in the statement of cash flows.
Payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, investment in securities (except trade securities), and non-trade receivable are reported as investing activities.

A gain or loss on sale of land is reported as an investing activity. Whether it is a gain or loss is determined by the difference between the amount of cash received from the sale and the book value.
For example, if the book value was $120,000 and you sold it for $150,000 that would be a gain of $30,000.

'''Cash flows from financing activities:'''

The cash flows from financing activities are the inflows and outflows of cash resulting from external financing of a business.
Activities that considered financing activities are sale of common and preferred stock, issuance of bonds and other debt securities, buyback of stock, payment of debt, and payment of cash dividends to shareholders.

'''Reconciliation with change in cash balance:'''

The financial statements must report a reconciliation of net income to net cash flows from operating activities.

'''Noncash investing and financing activities:'''

1.	Acquiring an asset by incurring a debt payable to seller.

2.	Acquiring an asset by entering into a capital lease.

3.	Converting debt into common stock or other equity securities.

4.	Exchanging noncash assets or liabilities for other noncash assets or liabilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Relationships ==
In mathematics when an equation is exactly in balance we say that both sides are equal.  We show this relationship with an equal sign.

When the two sides of the equation are not equal then one of the sides has to be larger.  When the left side is larger than the equation reads &quot;The left side is greater than the right side.&quot; and we use a greater than sign.  When the right side is larger than the equation reads &quot;The left side is less than the right side.&quot; and we use a less than sign.

Sometimes we want to include the number on the right side and still establish an inclusive relationship between the left and right sides.  In this case we use the relationships greater than or equal to and less than or equal to.  These relationships are also important because they are the inverse relationships for the greater than and less than relationships.  The inverse of greater than is less than or equal to, not just less than.  Similarly the inverse of less than is greater than or equal to not just greater than.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Metsora  Leviticus 14-15


&lt;u&gt;The law of the leper&lt;/u&gt;— (Torat haMetzora)   

Yahweh has already given the laws for determining if a person is a tzarua (leper). Now the Torah is turning to the issue of cleansing a tzarua who has been healed already.  This is not about healing the disease, as 14: 3 makes clear, but about purifying the ritual uncleanness so the ‘tzarua’ person can return to the camp. Ritual uncleanness in the camp would defile God’s holy presence in the land, as God says in Leviticus 15:31, 
“Thus you shall keep the sons of Israel separated from their uncleanness, so that they will not die in their uncleanness by their defiling My tabernacle that is among them.”

The offering of two living clean birds— The ceremony is so specific it seems to carry some symbolic meaning. Yet the symbolism can only be surmised, since the meaning is not stated. The two birds, one living and one dead, suggest someone in a state of death (dead bird) returning to life (live bird that is released). Since the leper lived in a perpetual state of mourning and was treated as though a corpse, the cleansing of a tzarua is a picture of resurrection from death.

Cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop—The rabbis admit to being puzzled by these symbols.  Some, who see leprosy as punishment for pride (and gossip) take the cedar to be a symbol of pride, since it is tall and strong.  The scarlet represents humility, they say, since the dye for scarlet is made from a worm.  Others see the cedar’s resistance to rot as the reason for its use, symbolizing the freeing of the leper from rot.  Another possibility is that cedar, which is a red colored wood, and scarlet are both chosen as symbols of blood purification or life (since blood is life).  The hyssop was used at Passover to paint blood on the door. These three elements together were burned along with the ashes of a red heifer to make water of purification (Numbers 19).


&lt;u&gt;Exclusion of the Leprous Person&lt;/u&gt;

If part of a person’s skin turns white, he is brought to a kohen for examination. Under certain circumstances, the kohen will order the person to be temporarily confined (musgar), to see if the signs of tzara’at develop into a definite plague (muchlot). After the period of confinement, the person, after further examination by the kohen, may be declared muchlat, or, alternatively, tahor (ritually clean). Under other circumstances, the kohen will declare the person muchlat immediately.

Once the person is declared muchlat by the kohen, he must isolate himself from the community:
And the Tzarua [not translated as “leper,” since they are not actually the same], upon whom the plague is found, his clothes shall be torn; his head shall be unkempt [i.e., he may not cut his hair]; and over his upper lip shall he be veiled; and “Tamei! Tamei!” shall he cry. All the days that the plague is upon him shall he be tamei; he is tamei.   He shall dwell in isolation; outside the camp shall be his dwelling (Vayikra 13:45-46).

The Tzarua, with his uncut hair and face covered, his clothing in tatters, and warning everyone not to come in contact with him, lives in complete isolation. He resided outside the camp in the desert; later, he lived outside any walled city in the land of Israel. Even other people who are rendered tamei must live isolated, in an all- tz’ru’im area. His life is a kind of living death, as he himself mourns his condition.

In view of all this, the following laws are especially surprising:
But if the tzara’at then breaks out further in the skin, and the tzara’at covers all the skin, [susceptible to] the plague, from his head to his feet, to all that is shown to the eyes of the kohen; then, the kohen shall look and behold tzara’at has covered all his flesh, and he shall pronounce the plague tahor… But, on the day that there appears healthy flesh in him, he shall become tamei. And the kohen shall view the healthy flesh and pronounce him tamei : the healthy flesh is tamei, it is tzara’at (Vayikra 13:12-15).

The case here, is when the person was first declared tamei, and then the tzara’at spreads throughout his body. When a person who has been declared tamei has an outbreak of tzara’at over his whole body (as seen by the kohen), then he is declared tahor! If, on the other hand, he was previously tahor, then an outbreak of full-body tzara’at renders him tamei! 

The issues regarding the unclean (tamei) and clean (tahor) and their relationship to leprosy is once again considered, especially in regard to the age-old challenges presented by the Evil Tongue which in Hebrew is labeled, Lashon Hara.

For centuries the Sages of Judaism have faithfully taught that these portions on a physical level, which address how you handle issues of childbirth purification, leprosy on skin, garments and the house and their purification procedures and the instructions regarding fluidic emissions from the body and how to purify all that has touched the issue.  

However, the important thing to remember is that although these procedures are recorded in great detail, what the Hebrew scholars and sons of Israel have concluded is that the Holy One is more concerned with the spiritual condition that these physical manifestations simply reflect.  Because while addressing the nuances of being physically tamei or unclean, the long-term consequences of spiritual impurity to the Body of the Messiah is far more detrimental to the health of ALL Israel.  

One of the challenges that faces all of humanity is the reality of our fallen nature. Whether a person believes the fact that he or she is a recipient of the curses that were placed upon Adam and Eve in the garden (Bereisheet/Genesis 3:16-19), the empirical evidence speaks for itself.

Mankind is burdened with various degrees of understanding inherited from tasting the knowledge of the tree of good and evil. So with that as a basic premise, the problems that are generated affect all cultures. The sons of Israel were not exempted, but instead were called out to be “a light unto the nations” (Yeshayahu/Isaiah 42:6; 49:6; 60:3) in order to reveal to the other nations a better plan that is ultimately embodied in the gift of Torah.  For His Divine purposes, the Holy One of Israel chose one man, Abraham, and through his descendants He has promised to bless all who choose to be blessed.

“And I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed” (Bereisheet/Genesis 12:3).

So through Abraham’s promised seed and what is eventually recorded in the Holy Scriptures, we have a divine chronicle of what the Creator has determined He wants to convey to His creatures that will ultimately give them life eternal. The problem is mankind has to constantly battle with the proclivity to follow the ways of our flesh instead of turning to the Tree of Life, Yeshua the Messiah, for the empowerment we need to walk in the ways of Torah.


&lt;u&gt;Speak No Evil&lt;/u&gt;

With all of that being said, one of the most prevalent calamities that infect the human soul is the inherent need to build oneself up or to feel better about oneself, when in the deep recesses of the mind, mankind attempts to justify, or at the least, cover up its sin nature. One of the most frequent ways to enhance your personal image is to put other people down.  By doing so, this allows the person to compare how much better he is than the person that he disparages.  The Scriptures are replete with admonitions against this very damaging human tendency.  Just this one portion from the Book of Proverbs states how vile the Holy One considers improper use of the tongue.

“There are six things which the LORD hates, yes, seven which are an abomination to Him: [1] haughty eyes, [2] a lying tongue, and [3] hands that shed innocent blood, [4] a heart that devises wicked plans, [5] feet that run rapidly to evil, [6] a false witness who utters lies, [7] and one who spreads strife among brothers” (Mishle/Proverbs 6:16-19).

Here the author describes three things that fall in the category of Lashon Hara, and if you include part of the “heart that devises wicked plans,” you could conclude that nearly half of the things that the Holy One of Israel HATES are a result of what comes forth from the mouth. For when you compliment this Proverb with some of the instructions that Yeshua teaches His listeners, you will be able to concede that what does usher forth from the mouth is indeed a reflection of an evil and wicked heart.

“But the things that proceed out of a man come from the heart; and those make the man common. For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, and slander” (Mattityahu/Matthew 15:18-19).

Now as you read this instruction from the Messiah, did you notice His use of the words “false witness” and “slander”?  These are two of the most vicious forms of killing that go way beyond a simple murder of an individual.  In fact, when you compare the difference between a one-time murder and the chronic character assassination perpetrated by a false witness against a person by slander, you might conclude that to be murdered once is preferred to the seemingly perpetual consequences of lies.

The classic example of this is the ancient Hebrew word picture that compares slander to a goose down feather pillow that has been cut open and cast to the wind.   Imagine if you will, some fallacious statements that are being made about you and how those very words have a tendency to float in all directions landing at different times.   Due to the nature of man described earlier, with mankind’s proclivity to want to feel better about them than what the reality truly is, when the gossip or rumor or slander of false witness is heard, there is a natural inclination to want to share the “juicy news” with others.   This innate problem in humanity has the effect of not only spreading the bad word, but it goes in every direction and lands at almost any unexpected time.

So the problem with lashon hara or the evil tongue is considered by the Rabbis to even be more damaging to a person than murder.   At least with murder, the event occurs only one time and it is over.   On the other hand, the result of slander and false witness can go on without end and continue to damage a person for not only his lifetime, but even beyond his life.


&lt;u&gt;Bodily Discharges&lt;/u&gt;   Lev. 15

Seminal emissions that come forth from the man cause him to be unclean before God and with the woman her menstrual cycle causes her to be unclean.    Since she did not become pregnant, an egg, which was a potential child, is released without having been made into a human life. This has also, to a certain degree, got to do with death, and therefore produces ritual uncleanness in the woman.  It is during this time of uncleanness that God commands husband and wife not to have sexual relations.  The Orthodox take this command very seriously, to the extent, they will sleep in separate rooms during this time.  This makes it so when they once again are able to come together it is like being newly married.  This time apart also allows the woman’s body to heal itself and prepare for the next cycle of being able to conceive children.

The state of being tameh, ritually unclean, is produced when man has any type of contact with death. The human body is the main source of ritual uncleanness. Sexual intercourse has to do with death since millions of sperms die without producing human life.

In verse 31 of our passage from Leviticus we are told be become nazir.  Nazir means to separate or consecrate oneself to God and in order to do that we must separate ourselves from becoming unclean.  What is instructed here in the natural needs to be also established in the spiritual, we discover is it is impossible to do so without God’s help and this is where the enabling of the Spirit of Yahweh is necessary to give us the necessary grace to overcome.


&lt;u&gt;Unclean and Clean&lt;/u&gt;

Now you can perhaps see why the Holy One included in the Torah these passages that deal with the condition of unclean versus being clean.  Then when you really analyze these statements about skin conditions and different conditions because of natural bodily fluid excretions, you can begin to conclude that the point Moses in these passages is trying to get across to the children of Israel is that for a considerable amount of time during the normal course of our lives, men and women are simply in a state of “uncleanness.”   And when you really analyze these two Torah portions, you can readily conclude that man’s unclean tendency is something we cannot do a whole lot about.   This is why we need to be covered by the atoning blood of the Messiah.

There is one prophetic picture that the Prophet Ezekiel shares with us that does a reasonably good job of describing some of the inherent problems associated with being unclean.   In chapter 36, that ultimately leads us into a critical chapter that describes some of the latter day events of the restoration, Ezekiel graphically tells of the condition that the House of Israel has to deal with while living in their own land.

“Son of man, when the house of Israel was living in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and their deeds; their way before Me was like the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.   Therefore I poured out My wrath on them for the blood which they had shed on the land, because they had defiled it with their idols.  Also I scattered them among the nations and they were dispersed throughout the lands.   According to their ways and their deeds I judged them.   When they came to the nations where they went, they profaned My holy name, because it was said of them, ‘These are the people of Yahweh; yet they have come out of His land.’ But I had concern for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they went.  Therefore say to the house of Israel, “Thus says the Lord Yahweh,  ‘It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for My holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you went. I will vindicate the holiness of My great name which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst.   Then the nations will know that I am Yahweh,’ declares the Lord Yahweh, ‘when I prove Myself holy among you in their sight.   For I will take you from the nations, gather you from all the lands and bring you into your own land.   Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.   I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will be careful to observe My ordinances.  You will live in the land that I gave to your forefathers; so you will be My people, and I will be your God. Moreover, I will save you from all your uncleanness’ 	Ezekiel 36:17-29a).

In this passage, Ezekiel compares the House of Israel to a woman in her state of niddah or being unclean.  Because Israel did not walk in the ways or perform the deeds that were expected of the sons of Israel by the Holy One, Israel was scattered to the nations.  Then to add insult to injury, the children of Israel profaned the name of Yahweh in the nations to which they were banished.  Then Ezekiel points out that Yahweh Himself, for His own name’s sake, will return the sons of Israel to the land and then will sprinkle Israel with clean water and cleanse Israel from all of his filthiness and idol worship.


&lt;u&gt;Becoming Sanctified&lt;/u&gt;

When we think of washing and water and the Word, the image of the Messiah washing His called out ones with the living cleansing water of the Word comes to mind as described by the Apostle Paul to the Ephesians.
“That He might sanctify it, cleansing it by the washing of the water with the spoken word” (Ephesians 5:26).
This especially comes to mind because as Ezekiel continues, he talks about the new heart of flesh and washing Israel with clean water, in order for Israel to actually be able to walk in His statutes and observe His ordinances.

“Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will be careful to observe My ordinances” (Yechezkel/Ezekiel 36:25-27).

In Psalm 51:7, it is written,   “Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean. Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.&quot;(HNV)

Without a doubt, it was the cleansing from tzaraat that was in the background of David’s prayer in this Psalm. After sinning with Uriah’s wife, he prays to be cleansed with hyssop in order to be rid of the “leprosy” of sin and death. When it mentions being whiter than snow, it means coming up cleaner than the one who is completely covered with tzaraat, so that he is all white, as it is written in Leviticus 13:13,  “then the priest shall examine him; and, behold, if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean of the plague. It has all turned white: he is clean.&quot;(HNV revised)

The Apostle Paul understood the absolute need for a new nature or to become a new creation in order to have that heart of flesh that follows the Spirit of the Most High.

“Therefore from now on we recognize no man according to the flesh; but even if we have known Messiah according to the flesh, yet now we no longer know Him so. Therefore if anyone is in Messiah, he is a renewed creature; the old has passed away, the renewed has come” (2 Corinthians 5:16-17).

The Apostle Peter also spoke of the “divine nature” and its attributes.
“Through which He has granted to us His precious and greatest promises, so that through them you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust. And for this same reason also, applying all diligence, in your faith supply excellence, and in excellence, knowledge; and in knowledge, self control; and in self-control, patient endurance; and in patient endurance, piety; and in piety, brotherly love; and in brotherly love, love. For if these are yours and are super-abounding, they keep you neither idle nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah. For he who lacks these is blind or short-sighted, having forgotten his cleansing from his former sins” (2 Kefa/Peter 1:4-9).

Both of these men in their writings were trying to encourage the post-Resurrection Saints to embrace their new natures. And of course when you read about these new natures, you will find that they have been delivered from the lusts of the flesh that include all of the human tendencies we spoke of earlier to want to use their tongues to put other people down so that they can elevate themselves.  Those hearts of the people who are still walking around in Adam’s fallen nature with hearts of stone, that are not being cleansed by the washing of the water of the Word.  They might be reading the Word, but things are not changing in their stony hearts.  Instead, they continue to evidence the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life (1 John 2:16).
These are the people who usher forth from their very mouths all of the things that Yeshua said would evidence that they are defiled or common. This is not a matter of what they eat, but rather their innate condition of their heart.

“‘THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR FROM ME. BUT IN VAIN THEY WORSHIP ME, TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE INJUNCTIONS OF MEN.’ And after He called the crowd to Him, He said to them, ‘Hear, and understand. Not what enters into the mouth makes the man common, but what proceeds out of the mouth, this makes the man common” (Matthew 15:8-11).

Therefore, the only solution to all of these maladies, whether they be spots on your skin, or lips that speak slander and give false witness against your fellowmen, or the natural flow of body fluids, is the faithful decision to confess and repent of your individual sins and transgressions and cry out to the Heavenly Father for mercy.

Then in His mercy to you, as a result of the blood atonement provided by the work at Calvary, you can now be a new creature, washed by the blood (Revelation 7:14).  Then with your new heart of flesh, you will be compelled by the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit to continue washing yourself by the water of the Word as you grow in your love for Him and the work He has done to make you eternally clean.   Then perhaps in your thankfulness for your new life, you can be one of those who instead can serve Him and be clean!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==G.1 The nature of EM waves and light sources==

===G.1.1 Outline the nature of electromagnetic (EM) waves===
Light is an EM wave. The speed of light is independent of the velocity of the source of the light.

Electromagnetic waves consists of oscillating magnetic and electric fields that are at 90 degrees to each other and in phase. This can be visualised as two transverse waves perpendicular to each other, propagating in the same direction.


===G.1.2 Describe the different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum===
[[File:EM_Spectrum_Properties_edit.svg]]

Most importantly is visible light from roughly 400-700 nanometres

===G.1.3 Describe what is meant by the dispersion of EM waves===
The splitting of white light into its component colours when it passes from one medium to the other because different media have different refractive indices is called dispersion (as shown below).
Red has the highest wavelength therefore it has the lowest frequency, in comparision to blue light which has  low wavelength and a high frequency.
[[File:Prism_rainbow_schema.png]]

===G.1.4 Describe the dispersion of EM waves in terms of the dependence of refractive index on wavelength===
In the example above, red is diffracted the least, while violet the most. This is because the waves of lower frequency (i.e. red) are diffracted less (have a lower refractive index).

Dispersion can occur throughout the EM spectrum not just for light.

===G.1.5 Distinguish between transmission, absorption and scattering of radiation===
Consider an EM wave going through a medium:


     ----------|medium|---------&gt;


By common sense:
* the wave is transmitted if it goes straight through
* the wave is absorbed if the substances in the medium (e.g. molecules in air) absorb its energy. This energy can be re-emitted.
* the wave is scattered if it bounces of particles in the medium into random directions.
Waves can be partially transmitted/absorbed/scattered.

===G.1.6 Discuss examples of the transmission, absorption and scattering of EM radiation===
The most common example is; Why is the sky blue and sunsets red?
* During the day: blue light is scattered by small dust particles in the atmosphere. If there was no atmosphere, the sky would be black.
* During sunsets: the light must travel through more atmosphere. Blue light is scattered more than red light (because it has a shorter wavelength) so the blue light is scattered too much before it reaches you, therefore we only see the red light.


Other examples include; UV light being absorbed by the ozone layer and infra-red radiation being absorbed by greenhouse gases (causing global warming).

==Lasers==
===G.1.7 Explain the terms monochromatic and coherent===
Monochromatic (mono=one, chromatic=colour) light is of a small range of wavelengths, for example from 500-501 nm. Light bulbs are NOT monochromatic as white light is a mixture of many different frequencies.


Coherent light means the waves are linked together, that is all the photons emitted are in phase with one another.

===G.1.8 Identify laser light as a source of coherent light===
&quot;Laser light is a source of coherent light&quot;.

===G.1.9 Outline the mechanism for the production of laser light===
Laser stands for &quot;Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation&quot;. 

Stimulated emission, refers to a process where 'electrons that are in an excited state' emit photons and drop to a lower state. This is caused by another photon passing by the excited electron (giving a total of two photons). By nature, both photons are of the same wavelength and are in phase (explanation is not required).


Lasers work by pumping lots of energy into the laser such that over 50% of the electrons in a medium are in an excited state. It then has two mirrors, one of which lets 1% of photons through (this is the light we see).


Search for an animation on the internet to explain this properly.

===G.1.10 Outline an application of the use of a laser===
Choose one of the following:
* medical applications (laser surgery)
* communications
* technology (bar-code scanners, laser disks)
* industry (surveying, welding and machining metals, drilling tiny holes in metals)
* production of CDs
* reading and writing CDs, DVDs, etc.

==G2 Optical Instruments==
===G.2.1 Define the terms principal axis, focal point, focal length and linear magnification as applied to a converging (convex) lens===

Principal Axis: ''is a straight line that goes through the centre of the lens at right angles to lens surface.''

Focal Point: ''the point on the principal axis through which a ray parallel to the principal axis passes through after refraction in the lens.''

Focal Length: ''The distance of the focal point of a lens from the centre of the lens''

Linear Magnification (m):''is the ratio between the size (height) of the image (h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) and the size (height)of the object (h&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;). It has no units.''

&lt;math&gt; m=\frac{h_i}{h_o} &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Convex lens diagram.svg]]

===G.2.2 Define the power of a convex lens and the dioptre===

The power of a lens is a measure of how much light is bent by it.
The power of the lens (P) is defined in terms of the focal length of the lens (f):

: &lt;math&gt; P=\frac{1}{f} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The unit for the power of a lens is ''m'' &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; or dioptres (dpt)

===G.2.3 Define linear magnification===

Linear magnification (m) is defined as the ratio of the height of the image ''h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the height of the object ''h&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'':

&lt;math&gt; m=\frac{h_i}{h_o} &lt;/math&gt;

===G.2.5 Distinguish between a real image and a virtual image===
A real image is formed when light rays actually coverge (come together) in a point. Can be projected. 

A virtual image is formed by light rays which appear to converge from a point. Cannot be projected on a screen.

===G.2.6 Apply the convention &quot;real is positive, virtual is negative&quot; to the thin lens formula===
===G.2.7 solve problems for a single convex lens using the thin lens formula===
==The simple magnifying glass==
===G.2.8 Define the terms far point and near point for the unaided eye===

For the normal eye, the far point may be assumed to be at infinity and the near point is conventionally taken as being a point 25 cm from the eye.

'''Near point -''' Distance between the eye and the nearest object that can be brought comfortably into focus. “least distance of distinct vision”

'''Far point''' Distance between the eye and the furthest object that can be brought into focus.

===G.2.9 Define angular magnification===
===G.2.10 Derive an expression for the angular magnification of a simple magnifying glass formed at the near point and at infinity===
==The compound microscope and astronomical telescope==
===G.2.11 Construct a ray diagram for a compound microscope with final image formed close to the near point of the eye (normal adjustment)===
===G.2.12 Construct a ray diagram for an astronomical telescope with the final image at infinity (normal adjustment)===
===G.2.13 State the equation relating angular magnification to the focal lengths to lenses in an astronomical telescope in normal adjustment===
===G.2.14 Solve problems involving the compound and the astronomical telescope===

==Aberrations==
===G.2.15 Explain the meaning of spherical aberrations and of chromatic aberration as produced by a single lens===

You are expected to know of two types of optical aberrations, ''chromatic'' and ''spherical''.

'''''Chromatic aberrations''''' are caused by the fact that different wavelengths of light are refracted different amounts by the glass in the lens which after all has a different density than air. This can be counteracted by using several lenses after each other that have different refractive indexes to effectively &quot;bend the color back&quot;.

'''''Spherical aberrations''''' on the other hand are a result of that no lenses are perfectly spherical. Thus the light incident on the outer portions of the lens will be bent more than the light incident more in the center. To prevent this an aperture may be used to prevent light from hitting the outer portions of the lens.  

[[File:Chromatic aberration.png|thumb|center|A diagram showing chromatic aberration]]

[[File:Spherical aberration (PSF).png|thumb|center|A diagram showing spherical abrration]]

===G.2.16 Describe how spherical aberration in a lens may be reduced===
Spherical aberration in a lens may be reduced by:
* Shutting off the light near the edge of a lens (use an aperture).
* Grind the curvature.
* Use a combination of lenses. (eg. Use two lenses instead of one thicker one).

===G.2.17 Describe how chromatic aberration in a lens may be reduced===
Chromatic aberration in a lens may be reduced by:
* Using a combination of convex and concave lenses (a compound lens).

==G3 Two-source interference of waves==
===G.3.1 State the conditions necessary to observe interference between two sources===
In order for two light sources to create an observable interference pattern, the light from the two sources must be coherent.

===G.3.2 Explain, by means of the principle of superposition, the interference pattern produced by waves from two coherent point sources===
===G.3.3 Outline a double-slit experiment for light and draw the intensity distribution of the observed fringe pattern===

Young's double slit experiment

===G.3.4 Solve problems involving two-source interference===

==G4 Diffraction grating==
=== '''G.4.1 Describe the effect on the double-slit intensity distribution of increasing the number of slits.'''&lt;br /&gt;===
=== '''G.4.2 Derive the diffraction grating formula for normal incidence.''' &lt;br /&gt;=== 
=== '''G.4.3 Outline the use of a diffraction grating to measure wavelengths.''' &lt;br /&gt;=== 
=== '''G.4.4 Solve problems involving a diffraction grating.''' &lt;br /&gt;===

==G5 X-rays==

It is possible to call Perl functions and modules in Python. One way to do that is the [http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyPerl PyPerl Module]. It is not developed actively any more and for it to work in newer versions, one has to use [http://svn.mandriva.com/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/packages/cooker/python-perlmodule/current/SOURCES/ this] version and apply the patches.

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import perl
perl.eval( &quot;use lib './' &quot;)
perl.require( 'Module::ModuleName' )

obj = perl.callm(&quot;new&quot;, 'Module::ModuleName'  )
obj[ '_attr1' ] = 9
obj[ '_attr2' ] = 42
obj.fxn1()
&lt;/source&gt;

It is thus possible to handle Perl objects, change their attributes and call
their methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{draft}}

The implementation of '''global user rights''' on Wikimedia projects extends to the English Wikibooks. This policy defines their use on this wiki.

==Use of rights==

===Staff===
{{main|wmf:Staff}}

Staff are paid employees of the [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]]. Similar to the [[m:Ombudsman commission|Ombudsmen]], they hold global CheckUser rights as well as global adminship and global oversight rights. They will perform office actions when needed such as complaints related to [[w:defamation|defamation]], [[w:Privacy laws of the United States|privacy violations]], or [[w:copyright infringement|copyright infringement]].

* List of users with [[Special:GlobalUsers/Staff|staff rights]]

===Stewards===
{{main|m:Stewards}}
Stewards may use their [[#Global rollbackers|global rollback]] permission on the English Wikibooks, and may use [[Special:Undelete]] to view deleted revisions in the course of their duties as stewards. They are also permitted to use the oversight tool to suppress abusive usernames. Stewards generally should not use their global rights to perform tasks that could be performed by local users. In emergency situations where local users are unable or unavailable to act, stewards are asked to use their global rights to protect the best interests of Wikibooks.

In their global role, stewards grant CheckUser and Oversight permissions to all projects and can remove all permissions (in an emergency, or in response to a user request or Board decision). These actions can affect the English Wikibooks, but are done and logged at [[meta:Steward requests/Permissions]].

*List of users with [[Special:GlobalUsers/steward|steward rights]]

===Sysadmins===
{{main|m:System administrators}}

Wikimedia '''system administrators''' are people who do [https://wikitech.leuksman.com/view/Server_admin_log systems administration work] on the Wikimedia servers. They can change Wikimedia site's live copy of [[w:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]], read server logs, etc. Those with server access can also carry out various non-development tasks.

The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] legally controls the servers, so the [[Wikimedia:Board of Trustees|Wikimedia Board of Trustees]] are ultimately responsible for determining who has sysadmin access. However, they generally delegate this responsibility. On a day-to-day basis, various sysadmins with root access manage the server accounts.

System administrators may use their global rights in whatever manner they deem necessary to manage the Wikimedia Foundation's assets. 

*List of users with [[Special:GlobalUsers/sysadmin|sysadmin rights]]

===Ombudsmen===
{{main|m:Ombudsman commission}}

The '''ombudsman commission''' is tasked with investigating complaints about violations of the [[m:privacy policy|privacy policy]] (in particular concerning the use of [[m:CheckUser policy|CheckUser]] tools) on any Wikimedia project for the board in an official manner. The users who make up the ombudsman commission are given the ability to view the CheckUser log on every project. To file a complaint, please contact an Ombudsman privately.

The Ombudsmen may use their global rights for investigating complaints about violations of the [[m:privacy policy|privacy policy]]. Their use of the global rights is at the discretion and restriction of the Wikimedia Foundation board of trustees.

*List of users with [[Special:GlobalUsers/Ombudsmen|Ombudsmen rights]]

===Global bots===
{{main|m:Global bots}}

The English Wikibooks does not allow the use of global bots approved by the [[m:Global bots|Meta policy]] to update interwiki links. Users that run global bots are expected to follow [[Wikibooks:Bots]] when bots are used locally. English Wikibooks administrators may locally block global bots that do not confirm to English Wikibooks norms and policies.

*List of bots with [[Special:GlobalUsers/Global bot|global bot rights]]

===Global rollbackers===
{{main|m:Global rollback}}

Global rollbackers can use their rights by default, provided they have not previously had rollback removed at the English Wikibooks. If removal has previously occurred, they must request and be [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions|granted rollback locally]] by an [[Wikibooks:Administrators|English Wikibooks administrator]]. Furthermore, any English Wikibooks administrator can ask a global rollbacker to stop using rollback if what they deem to be misuse occurs, and the global rollbacker must comply with such a request. Such a decision by an administrator can be appealed to the [[WB:AA|wider community]]. Failure to comply may result in a block.

*List of users with [[Special:GlobalUsers/Global rollback|Global rollback rights]]

===Global sysops===
{{main|m:Global sysops}}
The global sysop group is activated on the English Wikibooks as community consensus to opt in was attained. By default, the proposal only applies to wikis with fewer than 10 sysops and/or fewer than 3 active sysops.  Global sysops are users with global permissions associated with the fighting of vandals, especially on smaller wikis which struggle to deal with the level of vandalism. Global sysops are permitted to use any of the rights associated with their role on the English Wikibooks, except as detailed below. A global sysop who breaches these policies, except in urgent cases where no administrator can be found, will be indefinitely blocked at the English Wikibooks and will undergo an immediate vote of confidence at [[m:Main Page|Meta]].

*List of users with [[Special:GlobalUsers/Global sysops|Global sysops rights]]

==== Deleted contributions ====
Certain types of deleted contributions remain visible to administrators through [[Special:DeletedContributions]]. Global sysops may not access this information without the express consent of an English Wikibooks administrator.

==Removal of rights==
A user who abuses their global rights by knowingly or recklessly using their global rights on the English Wikibooks in contravention of this policy should be reported to [[meta:Steward requests/Permissions]] or [[irc:#wikimedia-stewards|#wikimedia-stewards]] immediately, where the stewards will determine whether an emergency removal of tools is required. An indefinite block may also be placed on the account locally during this period if necessary to prevent further abuse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Example: Highway and City Gas Mileage ====

{| width=100% 
| width=30% |[[Image:Mpg_example2.PNG‎|left]]
| width=70% style=&quot;padding:15px;|The gas mileage sticker on cars gives two numbers: one for city driving, and one for highway driving.  If a sticker says the car gets 25 mpg in the city and 32 mpg on the highway how far can you drive?

The abbreviation mpg stands for miles per gallon.  The sticker on our car predicts that we get between 25 and 32 mpg, but when we drive our car we estimate how far we are going and how much gas we have in our tank.   When we graph we need to change our inequality to a function where x is the number of gallons of gas in our tank.

25x &lt; f(x) &lt; 32x.

The picture on the left has two lines one for y=25x and one for y = 32x.  The yellow portion of the picture represents how far we may be able to drive when we have x gallons of gas.  The vertical line at 10 shows us that we can drive between 250 and 320 miles on 10 gallons of gas.  The difference between these two numbers is 70.  If we drew a line at 1 gallon of gas we would see that we could drive between 25 and 32 miles, and the difference would be 7.  

What this graph shows us is the predicted range of miles we can drive on a given amount of gas.  The more gas we have, the more likely our actual mileage is going to be different from what the sticker on our car predicted.  If our actual mileage falls outside of this range than we may want to take our car to a mechanic to make sure everything is running correctly on our car.  If your mileage is too high the odometer on your car may be broken.  If your mileage is too low your car might need a tune up.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;Please see the last sentence in the second paragraph below&gt;


DHCP acknowledgement

When the DHCP server receives the DHCPREQUEST message from the client, it initiates the final phase of the configuration process. This acknowledgement phase involves sending a DHCPACK packet to the client. This packet includes the lease duration and any other configuration information that the client might have requested. At this point, the TCP/IP configuration process is complete.

The server acknowledges the request and sends the acknowledgement to the client. The system as a whole expects the client to configure its network interface with the supplied options. are you sure about this?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">  The sentence is the basic structure that writers use to make the statements that form a paragraph.  the sentence uses words to express a complete thought and normally has at least one subject and one predicate.

sentence patterns

pattern 1; subject-verb
   the simplest sentence pattern we can use is the subject-verb pattern. all that is necessary to complete this pattern is  a subject and an intransitive verb, the kind of verb that takes no object.

1.Birds fly
2.fish swim

pattern 2 subject-verb -subject complement

this pattern uses alinking verb (a form of the verb be or verbs such as appear, become, feel, grow, look, make , seem, smell, and sound) to connect a subject to its complement, the word or words that describe the subject.

1.that pie smells delicious 
2.she is a lawyer.
3.he seems preoccupied recently.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Education is giving out information and communicating to your trainees ==


Many people don't understand the difference between [http://oudegreeresults2010.blogspot.com/2010/06/osmania-university-degree-results-2010.html '''education'''] and training. Education is giving out information and communicating to your trainees. Training is about practice and building skills. Today's younger generation of employees wants to be trained, not educated.

Problem is, if we don't educate them before we train them, it could lead to problems. Think about how you learned to drive. You need knowledge of the laws and then the actual training of getting behind the wheel. Same can be said for learning about the birds and the bees--if the education part isn't done effectively, the training could lead to undesirable results!

Mark Flores, director of ops for Chuck E. Cheese's, uses the macaroni-and-cheese example to demonstrate the difference. We've all made mac &amp; cheese plenty of times in our lives, but if we don't follow the instructions exactly, we might get macaroni soup, crunchy macaroni, or something else other than what we intended. So how do we deliver education and training to ensure consistency?

Manuals. Boooooooooring! We do need documentation, but make it fun! Include tons of photos and minimal text so it's more of a comic strip look. People are more likely to remember what they see versus what they read, so retention of information is better. Additionally, it's easier to translate into other languages.

Videos. Better than reading for most employees, but they need to be short segments (3--5 minutes maximum) with tons of visual image changes. Our employees today are used to watching CNN with talking video, a crawler message along the bottom, and the weather forecast on the side--all while having four online chats with their friends. Long, drawn-out videos lose their attention quickly. Watch a segment and go practice what you learn. You can watch the next segment after that.

Online. Golden Corral, White Castle, Sea Island Shrimp House, Buffalo Wild Wings, and Chuck E. Cheese's are all using or testing e-learning. Since it is self-paced, it goes at the speed of the learner. Be careful: As we've seen with e-books, it's not too comfortable to read a book on a PC, so keep the text to a minimum. Review questions can be built in as a checkpoint for the learner to advance to the next section. Great way to replace video and print, but it's still not &quot;training.&quot;

Tests. We all hate tests! To ensure consistency in tests, keep them simple and visual (use as many pictures as possible), and use multiple-choice, ordering, or true-false format to ensure consistency in grading. Most of our employees no longer take fill-in-the-blank or essay tests. Ensure they have the basics down. Do all your trainers actually grade tests the same way?

All the above forms of &quot;training&quot; are really just [http://oudegreeresults2010.blogspot.com/2010/06/osmania-university-degree-results-2010.html '''education'''], yet most managers think it's training. We didn't get our driver's license after reading the book, watching the video, and passing a test--we had to demonstrate our skills to the authorities before we received permission to drive. Education is the necessary evil that must come first, though.

Do we follow the same format with our employees? Many companies do not--we just memorize a bunch of useless information the guest cares little about and then we're ready. You need to be validated on the skills it takes to do the job and re-validated periodically in the future. Knowing the job and doing the job are two entirely different things--and the guest notices.

Skill Validation

Having the new employee demonstrate skills for a manager shows you two things: how good the trainer was, and that the employee can do the functions of the job. We all might think we have the same definition of &quot;greet the guest&quot; or &quot;suggestive sell,&quot; but when we see our employees in action, we find it's all across the board. If we don't coach them through the skill, they will simply do what they see at other restaurants (which often isn't good). Conduct these validations every 90--180 days to keep standards top of mind.

People train people. Just because someone is a good employee doesn't mean they will be a good trainer. The proper tools to educate will help, but the payoff is in the trainer demonstrating, coaching, and validating the skill of a new employee. To illustrate this point to your team, ask your trainers to train you on how to tie your shoes or put on a shirt. Act like you know nothing about it. Point being, it's a simple task we can all do in our sleep--like ringing up orders or making burgers--but it's incredibly hard to train someone else how to do it.</text>

==[[Wikibooks:WikiProject Mathematics]]==
Noticed that you were editing [[Trigonometry]] a bit and I thought you might want to know about the mathematics wikiproject. If you have any questions that related to putting mathematics on a wiki you can ask there (or ask me if you prefer).

== Orphaning ==

Please understand that removing links to a page is not a deletion of that page.  You must request deletion with {{tl|delete}} with valid rationale.  Removing links to a page will be discovered as pages with no links get added to a maintenance list.  At that time removal of links will be reversed.  I have merged the page you delinked into another book, but it is not proper etiquette to simply &quot;orphan&quot; a page that you dislike.  Just a friendly notice. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:45, 2 September 2010 (UTC)

      <comment>Brackets are not part of the syntax of returning a value</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''&lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;''' statement causes execution to jump from the current function to whatever function called the current function. An optional a result ('''''return variable''''') can be returned. A function may have more than one '''&lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;''' statement (but returning the same type).

;Syntax:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
return;
return value;
&lt;/source&gt;

Within the body of the function, the '''&lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;''' statement should NOT '''&lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;''' a pointer or a reference that has the address in memory of a local variable that was declared within the function, because as soon as the function exits, all local variables are destroyed and your pointer or reference will be pointing to some place in memory which you no longer own, so you cannot guarantee its contents.  If the object to which a pointer refers is destroyed, the pointer is said to be a ''dangling pointer'' until it is given a new value; any use of the value of such a pointer is invalid.  Having a dangling pointer like that is dangerous; pointers or references to local variables must not be allowed to escape the function in which those local (aka automatic) variables live.

However, within the body of your function, if your pointer or reference has the address in memory of a data type, '''struct''', or class that you dynamically allocated the memory for, using the new operator, then returning said pointer or reference would be reasonable:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
SOMETYPE *MyFunc()  //returning a pointer that has a dynamically 
{           //allocated memory address is valid code 
  int *p = new int[5]; 

  //... 

  return p; 
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In most cases, a better approach in that case would be to '''&lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;''' an object such as a smart pointer which could manage the memory; explicit memory management using widely distributed calls to &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt;) is tedious, verbose and error prone. At the very least, functions which '''&lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;''' dynamically allocated resources should be carefully documented.  See this book's section on memory management for more details.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
const SOMETYPE *MyFunc(int *p) 
{
  //... 

  return p; 
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case the SOMETYPE object pointed to by the returned pointer may not be modified, and if SOMETYPE is a class then only '''const''' member functions may be called on the SOMETYPE object.

If such a '''const''' '''&lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;''' value is a pointer or a reference to a class then we cannot call non-const methods on that pointer or reference since that would break our agreement not to change it.

{{NOTE|As a general rule methods should be '''const''' except when it's not possible to make them such. While getting used to the semantics you can use the compiler to inform you when a method may not be '''const''' -- it will (usually) give an error if you declare a method '''const''' that needs to be non-const.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two schools of though in hiring someone for the CI role. Some believe that hiring someone with CI exeprience is the best other believe that its better to hire with industry experience and then train the CI skillsets. 

Both approaches seem to work, though hiring a seasoned CI professional helps get a CI department up and running very quickly. 

The Body of Knowledge in Competitive Intelligence defines a framework for the skills and competencies every CI-Professional should know.

      <text xml:space="preserve">War games are simulations of the external environment to anticipate the external response and to proactively prepare for it.

What follows is an outline of Ben Gilad's book entitled &lt;u&gt;Business War Games&lt;/u&gt;.

Compiled by Kristian Erik Hermansen

Part I: From Sand Table to Boardroom

Chapter 1: War Gaming Made Simple
Marketing managers, brand teams, and product and project leaders should be able to run quick, cheap, and effective war games to:
Assess and anticipate changes in their markets.
Pressure-test global and regional strategies.
Develop and test plans to go after existing competitors or defend against rising threats.
&quot;Insulate&quot; new launches.
Get a buy-in, identify gaps in market knowledge, and create a defensible business case.
Hannibal’s victory
The previous diagram depicts the initial positions. The Roman forces are on top. Both armies placed their infantry in the center, with a cavalry unit on each side. Note that Hannibal 's left cavalry wing was much larger than the right, and that his center was pitched forward. 
Because they enjoyed tremendous numerical superiority, the Romans attacked f rst, sending in their infantry. Hannibal knew that was what they were likely to do. He ordered his center to retreat and, at the same time, the large left-wing cavalry to start a flanking maneuver, overwhelming the numerically inferior Roman cavalry wing.
In the heat of the advance, the Romans did not notice that they were being flanked from behind, and that Hannibal c infantry was drawing them into an arc. Then Hannibal 's center stopped retreating.
The Roman legionnaires were surrounded. Sixty thousand of them perished that day, making it one of the bloodiest battles in the history of wars.
War gaming is nothing more than role-playing in order to understand a third party, with the goal of answering:
What will the opponent do?
What then is my best option?
War Gaming in Business: Where Does It Make the Most Sense?
in testing a competitive plan-for a single product, a brand portfolio, a division, or a whole company.
The &quot;We've Already Taken This Into Account&quot; Myth
The Delusion of Absolute Performance
War Games Without Computers
Did Hannibal need a laptop? No.
Why Not Game Theory?
Their predictions of stable solutions are not consistent with observed behavior.
Humans Make It Realistic
role-playing games bring far superior results, because predicting human and organizational behavior is far beyond current mathematical models.
War Games Without the War?
In business, strategy is always about a third party (the customer) whose role in deciding who is a &quot;victor&quot; is rather complex and may involve keeping the competition alive rather than allowing for a decisive &quot;victory.&quot;
Would You Prefer &quot;IRS&quot;?
&quot;Iterations of Rivals' Strategics&quot;
So What Is the Best Way to War Game?
put together a competitor's character.
The 7 Tests of Effective War Gaming It has to be:
Realistic.
Empowering.
Accessible.
Lots of fun.
Inexpensive.
Simple.
Transparent.
To remember these seven tests, remember this simple acronym: An effective war game makes the manager a REALIST. Effective managers are neither optimistic nor pessimistic. They meet the market reality well prepared.
Aren't Most Managers Already Realists?
Maybe, but...
The best strategies, the most rigorous research, the clearest of operating plans-all are undermined because the key people behind them have missed the reality of the situation for one reason or another.
When to Play a War Game
Formal Prerequisites for a War Game
You need to make a decision, create a plan.
There are external third parties whose reactions greatly affect the success of this decision, and you do not have direct intelligence on their intended reactions, nor are they inclined to provide you with an advanced copy of their plans.
There is cost involved if your decision is a wrong one.
Informal Prerequisites for a War Game
Management allows for the possibility of plans to go wrong, and is willing to make changes to strategy to improve its odds under competitive pressure.
Management allows a free exchange of information in a game. If your boss already made up his mind about a strategy, there is little point in running a game.
When Not to Play War Games
Some executives are narcissistic, and see their plans as infallible. It does not mean they have bad strategies. They simply cannot make good use of war gaming. I would not run a war game with either Lee Iacocca or Dick Cheney in the room.
War Gaming and the More Traditional Planning Approaches
War gaming does not replace strategic planning.
Fringe Benefits of Effective War Games
Sustained External Focus
Intelligence gaps
Buy-in
Self-awareness
Case Study: There's a New Sheriff in Town
Let us sum up Ed's situation again, because so many managers can find themselves in a similar state on their way up. He needed to:
Formulate a better strategy.
Build a strong business case behind this strategy.
Get a buy-in from key people. (We can call it the &quot;3b&quot; case for short.)
The 3b Case as a Special Case of War Gaming
Strategies that are created in a vacuum, succeed in a vacuum only.
knowing who your competitor's habitual consultant is, is one good starting point to predicting its moves.
A lot of good knowledge of the competitive reality resides with middle management and field people, not top management.
a war game legitimizes the poking of &quot;holes&quot; and airing of blind spots in a company's strategy through the potential actions of rivals.


Chapter 2: Big war games, little war games, and what did they do without computers?
Famous Military War Games
Frederick the Great of Prussia actually took a mobile war gaming toolkit with him to all of his military operations.
Otto von Bismarck, the &quot;Iron Chancellor&quot; of Prussia, was famous as well as notorious for his insistence on basing every political, diplomatic, and military move on a profound understanding of underlying dynamics and likely responses.
Little Wars
the Israeli hostage rescue operation in Entebbe, Uganda, shows just how the art should be practiced.
Tiny War Games
Back in the early 20th century, H.G. Wells published two books, Floor Games (1911) and Little Wars (1913), that offered a set of rules for playing war games using toy soldiers.
War Games in a Different Context
Great white sharks hunt sea lions. They show an ability to at least act in patterns that resemble those of a war gaming strategist: thinking ahead of the potential response from the other player.
Now the question: Is your company the shark or is it the sea lion?
The Move to Business War Games
The discipline of finance has led the charge in responding to the post-World War II world of business, on two fronts:
mitigating risk (corporate finance)
influencing the top executive discourse.
The risk piece, despite fits and starts, has generally worked well during the past 30 years:
New financial instruments have given companies a new way to manage risk and expand their reach. Puts and calls, hedging of inputs (think Southwest and the price of oil), weather futures, and, of course, the use of options.
Financial modeling and credit scoring allowed better risk management for lenders. Bank-based credit card lenders, for example, took a bath in earlier recessions, but made a bunch of money in the 1990s.
The creative use of capital markets allowed companies to spread risk. The Capital Asset Pricing Model is the big example. A more-specific example is how mortgage-backed securities solved the problem of spreading out the payment streams during the life of the bonds.
reducing strategy to a series of discounted cash flows (DCF), real options (the new game in town), or good old estimated profit-and-loss statements is a recipe for disaster. Just look at Enron, a wizard of P&amp;Ls and forward-looking financial planning.



Part II: Competitors as Characters

Chapter 3: Can You Accurately Predict Competitors’ Moves?
You don't need 100-percent accuracy to improve your plan's odds of success. All you need is a realistic and pragmatic assessment of competitors' most likely responses.
Start here
Competitors' moves do not happen in a vacuum.
Market Imbalance
Theories of market behavior can be roughly divided into two types:
neoclassical equilibrium theories (including variants such as game theory and decisions under uncertainty)
Schumpeterian market theories (named for Joseph A. Schempeter, author of Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy [Harper &amp; Row, 1942]).
In a stable market, opportunities are exhausted and rates of return tend to equalize, and there is no intrinsic reason to change the situation.
Schumpeterian theory, on the other hand, regards markets as in a constant state of flux
What Causes Markets' Constant Imbalance?
Michael Porter's Five Forces model of industry analysis is a good starting point.
The Most Predictive Theory of Competitors' Behavior
none has come even close to the predictive power of Michael Porter's pioneering Four Corners Model.
Porter's model posits that competitors' behavior is influenced by 4 antecedents or &quot;corners&quot; in a balance-sheet type table, such as this one:
Motivation
Observed Behavior
- Drivers
- Management assumptions
- Current strategy
- Capabilities
Porter advocated a closer look at what neuroscientists term automatic or unobserved processes, underlying observed behavior.
New Neuroscience Research
The result is the following four brain activities:
Automatic cognitive.
automatic cognitive process is a reflexive processing of percepts, such as in visual identification, language understanding, or quick physical reactions.
Deliberate cognitive.
Deliberate cognitive activities control rational thinking, such as calculations of economic value added (EVA) of projects.
Automatic affective.
Automatic affective activities apply where affects (feelings and moods) automatically create impressions based on memory and drives' states.
Deliberate affective.
Deliberate affective activities intervene mostly when one tries, for example, to deliberately imagine past emotional experiences in order to understand another person's feelings (such as in method acting).
A 2003 study of gifts given to physicians by pharmaceutical companies reveals amazing results.' Physicians in this study adamantly denied being influenced in their prescription practices by those gifts despite experimental evidence to the contrary.
The neuroscientists are quite clear on one thing: &quot;The struggle between rapid unconscious pattern-detection processes and their slow, effortful modulation by deliberation is not a fair contest; so automatic impressions will influence behavior much of the time.&quot;
Give the executives spreadsheets and they can make a case for anything according to their prior beliefs.
So, in analyzing competitors, pay close attention to the left-hand side of Porter's Four Corners Model if you want to make accurate predictions.
Do You Need Role-Playing?
Predicting competitors' actions requires the ability to &quot;read&quot; others' minds, and, apparently, we are not all born equal with regard to this ability.
Brodmann 10 area in the frontal cortex.
Mirror Imaging
Companies spend 20 minutes reassuring themselves that they know what competitors will do. And yet acting is not serious?
Managerial Biases
The problem is that, without a rigorous framework to guide this thinking, research shows that managers are likely to fall into the following traps:
Intuition takes over.
Emotions take over.
Over-optimism takes over.
Myopia takes over.
So use a state-of-the-art theory of competitors' real behavior
The Secret to Amazing Predictions
The art here is that of narrowing down the possibilities to those most likely moves.
Predicting competitors' moves is similar to predicting hurricanes.
So, What Are Competitors Most Likely to Do?
Question # 1: &quot;Is the Competitor Satisfied With its Present Position in the Market?&quot;
Performing Industry Imbalance Analysis
Question # 2: &quot;What Are the Competitor's Hot Buttons?&quot;
Identifying a Competitor's Corresponding Management Assumptions and Beliefs About the Market
Question # 3: &quot;What Are the Competitor's Blind Spots?&quot;
Comparing #1 and #2
Bringing It All Together
Obvious vs. Most Likely
Playing the Host
So, in the end, predicting what your management will or will not do is as important as predicting what competitors will.


Chapter 4: Competitors as Characters
Get to the essence of competitors by understanding their character.
Characters
If nothing more, a war game is a great catalyst to push managers to actually research their competitors, rather than rely on their anecdotal, personal experience with then.
How Did Al Pacino Play Scarface's Tony Montana?
There are four elements to getting under a character's skin (their order does not matter) :
Use a &quot;Magic If.&quot;
Use the &quot;Magic If' within a script, a plot, or a story line.
Look for a &quot;theme.&quot;
Use sense memory.
&quot;Acting is hard because it requires not just the study of books...but constant study of human behavior.”

Part III: Step-by-step

Chapter 5: Step 1: Is it time to war game?
The Basic Requirements
Use a war game if:
You need to draw a plan or decide on a strategy.
The success of the plan depends on the real-world moves and countermoves of competitors (and other third parties).
You don't have direct information on those intended moves.
You don't want to just retake up hypothetical assumptions about what competitors' can do.
You are not interested in a theoretical modeling of the market but in predicting what competitors are most likely to do to your plan so you can &quot;competitor-proof&quot; it as much as possible.
A planning failure could be costly to you and the firm.
Which Plans Call for War Gaming?
Meeting a change in market conditions (so-called Landscape games; see 	the next section).
Launching a new product or service.
Entering a new market.
Increasing share of a product/service
Reviving a brand.
Defending against a new competitor or against a growing threat of lower cost substitutes to your product/service.
Fundamental questions answered by all war games are:
What will competitors do?
How can we outsmart them?
Applying these two questions to the previous list of plans means you are looking for deeper insight on such problems as:
How is the market most likely to shift in the next three years, and how can we meet these changes better than competitors?
How do we increase market share in our current markets without giving up the store and starting a price war?
What is the best way to launch our new or improved prod uct/ brand against tough competitors?
With what do we replace our current product when its life is over, and stay ahead of the competition?
What is the best way to enter the Brazilian (Chinese, Israeli, Indian, Hungarian, and so on) market?
How do we defend against new entry of molecules EL2043 and Pf7077 into our market? (This isn't a joke; it's pharmaceutical company lingo. That's the way they talk!)
How do we take back the leadership position in this segment against competitors who are bigger, better financed, and better positioned in customer’s minds?
How do we maintain our product leadership position against the rising power of low-cost Chinese manufacturers?
You may not like the answers, but war games are the most realistic setting to place these questions on the table before going to market
1 Limitation
The only limitation on simple, low-cost, transparent war games is that they should be focused on one industry, or one set of players at a time.
Which War Games Are Appropriate?
There are basically two types of games:
games for formulating a new plan (Landscape games)
games for testing an existing plan (Test games)
Landscape Games
Landscape games are aimed at unmasking the underlying, ambiguous changes in a market early on.
Test Games
Test games test an already developed strategy against the likely responses of competitors (and, at times, customers, potential alliance partners, government or industry regulators, distributors, and so forth).
But What if They Do X?
Hannibal won the battle against the much-larger Roman army because he predicted their most likely move, not because he planned against everything that could go wrong!
So, No Testing Against Surprises?
test against unexpected responses within the context of exposing blind spots in the host company's thinking.


Chapter 6: Avoid Potential War Gaming Traps: Bad Timing, Unreceptive Management, and Insular Culture
Bad Timing
Test failed: # 2
Test # 2 of any war game you decide to run is that the game must empower you to walk away from a bad plan.
Unreceptive Management
Tests failed: # 1, 6, 7
The result is often an unrealistic game, because confronting an unpleasant reality may meet with resistance.
Thin-Skinned Executives
Some research suggests that, as one climbs the corporate ladder, the ability to face criticism diminishes.
Neurotic Managers
Some executives who lack self-confidence, or are new to their positions and have a strong fear of failure, may want a game to go exactly as they envisioned it.
Domineering Bosses
The problem is that, if their style is aggressive enough, they will dominate the game to a point where others' perspectives and analyses will get depressed.
Insular Culture
Tests failed : #1, 4, 6, 7
Sometimes a company's culture can work against an effective game.
A &quot;not invented here&quot; culture will prevent strategic options from being superior.
A &quot;harmony at all cost&quot; culture will prevent discussions from pointing out blind spots and will confine confrontation to polite exchanges.
A paranoid culture will prevent transparent discussions.
A cynical culture will treat any discussion during a war game as useless.


Chapter 7: Step 2: The Teams -- Who Do We Not Invite?
Note: The following rules of thumb apply to games lasting between one and one and a half days, consistent with the need to keep the game inexpensive and accessible to middle managers.
Rule of Thumb # 1:
The Number of People in a Game Should be in the Range of 12-48.
Rule of Thumb #2:
The Number of Players per Team Should Not be Less Than 3 and No More Than 8
Rule of Thumb # 3:
The Number of Teams Should. Not Exceed. 6
Who to Invite
Your team, of course.
Other people in the organization who have experience facing these competitors in other markets or knowledge about competitors' characteristics.
If possible and practical:
Competitors' former employees. (Beware of never asking them for proprietary information. They can contribute significantly to understanding the competitors' character, though.)
People whose support you need in order to accomplish the plan's goals.
Representatives of other functions with whom the plan should be coordinated for execution (production, legal, R&amp;D, and so forth).
People who have good knowledge of additional third parties in your market, such as customers, distributors, and regulators (according to their relevance to your situation).
Who to Invite Selectively and Cautiously
Advertising agencies.
Research vendors.
Customers.
Who Not to Invite
Easily offended people.
Shy people or people with a fear of speaking up.
Very junior employees.
Loud and over-aggressive people.
Un-fun people.
Senior executives who are thin-skinned, neurotic, or domineering.
Team Composition and Balance
Size Matters
Games that are played to pressure-test business unit strategy, at a global or regional level, are by nature played with more participants and at a higher level.
Competitors' Teams
The rule is to strive for diversity of perspectives and experiences, but it is a flexible rule.
Diversity is enhanced with:
Staff and field managers.
Various functional skills.
Experience and knowledge of the external environment.
Different personalities.
Personalities
Though the team majority will be made up of hardworking, dedicated, and toe-the-line managers, each team should have one &quot;troublemaker.&quot;
The Home Team
You should put courageous people on the home team.
The role of the home team is to bring an objective, market-oriented perspective to the plan.
The home team should leave the obvious to the competitor teams who are going to have a field day exploiting obvious weaknesses.
Who You Should Not Put on the Home Team
Try not to put the core members of the team that worked on the plan on the home team.
Where Should You Put Decision-Makers?
You don't have to have senior executives in your game. If you do, however, here are a few rules of thumb:
Put the most senior person in the room on a competitors' team, typically the largest (or most pressing) competitor.
If the game sponsor is a very senior executive, such a general manager or president of a division, or the company's CEO, and he or she expresses an interest in playing, put them on &quot;jury duty.&quot;
Senior-Executives-Only Games
Executives-only games fail Test #1 of Effective War Gaming: They are unrealistic.
So stay away from games saturated by high-powered people. Let the large consulting firms make millions off them.
Summary
Suggested Teams' Composition
Bulk of participants: marketing managers (including market research) plus competitor experts (competitive intelligence managers, insight managers, K1VI managers, former competitors' employees)
Augmented by: Sales managers, operations people, a finance analyst, technology/R&amp;D managers.
And always try to include a troublemaker or two!
Team Leadership
When the game is a &quot;family-intimate&quot; game, without a clear boss on a team, teams assign &quot;leadership&quot; roles naturally to the first person who takes charge.
Team Facilitators
One person on the team, or an outside secretarial help, must capture the team's notes for both presentation and record.


Chapter 8: Deciding Who to Role-Play
Which Competitors Should You Role-Play?
Quite often, the choice is obvious.
The largest competitors or those that have the ability to become large 	competitors.
Strategic Grouping
The importance of strategic groups is their effect on how their members react to 	change in the environment.
Competitors in your cluster use a similar type of assets and similar strategies to go after the same customers you do !
Who Looks Like You?
Before you war game, draw a quick and intuitive map defining the clusters in your industry based on major strategic differences, not tactical moves.
No Clusters? No Problem
If you can't think of strategic clusters in your industry, don't feel bad: You are in good company.
Porter’s competitive convergence
Composite Profile
A composite profile minimizes the differences between the competitors in the service of creating a sense of their character and, therefore, their likely response.
Role-Playing Other 3rd Parties
Consider these cases the exception, though. Most war games are about competitors.


Chapter 9: Step 3: Intelligence and then Some
gather credible intelligence and prepare a briefing book for the game's participants to be able to role-play a competitor as realistically as possible
The Absolutely, Positively Necessary Information
What do we want to know about a character?
What are the character's age and background?
What are the character's relationships with others and with the physical surrounding?
What is the character's physical state of being?
What is the character's emotional state?
What does the character want?
What does the character presently do?
What immediate precedents caused the character to do this?
How does the character perceive him/herself?
What prevents the character from accomplishing his or her objectives (from within and without)?
Team Briefing
You will find the task imminently easier if-'you think of the competitor data as clues to the competitor's character.
Where did it come from?
Competitor's history
What has it kept from its past?
Competitor's culture
What is it doing now?
Product market position.
Relationships with distributors.
Relative strength with customers.
Strength of sales force, relative share of S&amp;A cost, compensation of salespeople, their skill level.
Marketing approach: advertising, promotion.
Production essentials
Research prowess
Financial ratio analysis (comparative to you)/overall cost position: Is it a low-cost leader?
Depth of management: Are the young as good?
Corporate overall portfolio strength.
What does it want?
The competitor's stated goals (especially financial).
Its real &quot;bottom-line&quot; expectations from the business unit, brand, or product you are up against.
How does it think?
Habitual Large Consulting Firms (HLCF) used by competitor's management.
Executives' background (professional, personal, educational). Anyone parachuting from the HLCF?
More important is to get some background on the executives you are facing with your product or brand than on the top brass at corporate.
Internal politics: Who is influential? Who is rising? What camps are formed?
Board composition and board-CEO relationships. Rubber stamp? Independent agendas? Wimps? Role models?
The place of the product/brand/business unit you are going against in the parent's company portfolio. Is it important? Is it a cash cow?
How does it feel?
Governmental and legal actions against the company.
How is its recent performance (especially on growth, market share, profits, ROI, and share price) compared with past performance and publicly stated goals?
Group Briefing
Include in this portion whatever is available from this list:
General articles from the business press (The Economist is by far the best, followed by the Wall Street Journal) on the industry as a whole.
Wall Street analysts' reports on the industry as a whole.
Trade magazine overview articles of the state of the industry and future trends.
Market research studies and surveys about the consumer/customer statistics, characteristics, and emerging trends.
Any news reports about acquisitions, mergers, entry by new players.
Any significant data about supply chain: major supply trends (availability and prices), labor trends, and so forth.
General articles about substitute industries and their trends
Sources
human and published. They are also known as primary and secondary.
If you have the money, conduct some interviews
If you invited salespeople into the game, they have a lot of tactical primary intelligence on customers and competitors.
Your engineers, scientists, and operation managers taking part in the game have some knowledge of competitors' production and R&amp;D capabilities.
Pay Attention to What They Do, Not What They Say
Quite often, a company's communication with the outside world goes through PR firms and internal communications departments.
Pay Attention to What They Say, Not Only What They Do
The last section's rule of thumb has one exception. If a company says outrageous things, it is worth paying attention, as you can glimpse a character underneath.
Who Should Prepare the Intelligence Briefing?
The short answer is your market or competitive intelligence (CI) manager.



Part IV: Running a Business War Game

Chapter 10: Step 4: Let’s Play! A Real Game Hour by Hour
Game 1: Reviving a Brand
The Settings
This is a description of a real game, played in the early 2000s, modified to protect the proprietary nature of the host company's information. The industry gamed was beverages.
The Plan to Be War Gamed
The global brand director and his team put together a &quot;brand revival&quot; plan that called for attacking the market leader aggressively and taking share away from it.
The Game's Structure
The game called for four teams with eight managers on each team, for a total of 32 players.
Game Type
Test game. The brand team prepared a plan and the game was called for to test it against market response.
Game Plan
Round 1: After a short presentation from the brand team, the four teams would break out to role-play competitors.
Round 2: The host team would be dispersed among the other teams.
Round 3: Having survived dynamic consistency tests (testing against competitors' likely reactions), suggestions for improvements would be examined for internal consistency (with the company's overall strategy) and external consistency (with the identified market disequilibrium).
Pre-game Preparations
Comment: Small touches such as a photo of the competitors' executives in charge of this category, a sample of competitors' products, and paraphernalia (competitors' logos, t-shirts, caps) help teams get in character. Use your imagination!
Hour-by-Hour Instructions (and Running Commentary)
8:00 Start the game by putting the existing plan on the table.
8:15-10:00 Introduce the methodologies. Remember: These methodologies work together to reach one goal: accurate predictions of competitors' likely moves.
10:00 Introduce the first round.
1:00-3:00 Let teams present their findings.
3:00-4:00 Introduce the second round.
4:00-7:00 Let the teams present their recommendations and battle each other.
7:00 Bring the game to a close with a clear conclusion.
Game 2: Launching a New Product
The Settings
The industry in this real-world game was pharmaceutical, an industry that considers itself a special case, with its own unique business model.
The Plan to Be War Gamed
The VP in charge of the therapeutic area (TA, the pharma industry's equivalent of a business unit)' for which the drug was developed asked the brand team to prepare a launching plan.
Game Type
Landscape Game
Hour-by-Hour Instructions With Commentary
8:00 Here are the essential assumptions behind the brand team's intended launch plan, the way they were presented by the brand manager:
10:00-12:00 Teams were sent to breakout rooms.
1:00-3:00 The teams presented.
3:00-4:30 Teams are sent to develop improvement to the launch plan. Is it even possible to salvage the plan?
4:30-7:00 Teams battle over strategic options for RFH.
7:00 The exhausted VP of the TA thanked the participants.


Chapter 11: Implementing the Game’s Results
At the End of the Game...
Step 1: Collect All Analyses.
Step 2: Do Not Leave Confidential Documents in the Room.
Step 3: Disseminate a Summary of the Game Among Participants.
Implementing the Game's Results
Communicating Decisions
Management should send an update to the game participants.
Reaping Hidden Benefits
War games create a &quot;competitive database&quot; that can last for years if stored and updated effectively.
These simple steps will ensure effective use of the capital:
Store the predictions and the rationale behind them in a file.
Ask someone from the competitor's team to follow up on the predictions within a certain time period, and update you.
If the predictions were off, analyze the reason and update the competitor's character.
If the predictions were on target, notify other members of your organization
Make sure to &quot;cc&quot; top management on the previous memo. It can't hurt, can it?
Strengthening Intelligence Capabilities
A war game uncovers your organization's intelligence capability-or lack thereof. You can ignore it, or you can capitalize on the findings.
The game revealed major intelligence gaps: critical things you didn't have a clue about.
The game revealed minor gaps: tactical details you would be happy to have had but actually affected no real change in your strategy.


Chapter 12: Strategic Junctures
How do you prove a war game is effective?
When Is Hindsight Valuable? Not Always
Yogi Berra is credited with saying it is hard to predict, especially the future.
&quot;Looking back, the should have done something three years ago.&quot;
The Fox That Outfoxed the Mouse
Strategic Juncture 1: The first war game should have been run by Disney shortly after Malone and Murdoch announced their marriage, and ESPN's CEO defected to the competition.
Fox Gets Serious
Strategic Juncture 2: At this point in 1997, Murdoch was showing his hand. He was going after regional franchises-both teams and TV stations.
Who Knew Flat Drinks Would Be All the Rage?
The acquisition of a leading sports-drink brand (Gatorade) was a way for Quaker Oats to diversify its sources of revenue.
Quaker bought Snapple, outbidding Coca Cola, paying $1.7 billion.
The purchase of Snapple in 1994 did not turn out to be such a good investment for Quaker Oats. It sold it at a big loss in 1997.
During the period Quaker controlled Snapple (between 1994 and 1997), Snapple lost 23 percent of its annual revenues.
When Technology Culture Blinds the Decision-Makers
Technologically focused companies tend to miss out on social/demographic changes that greatly affect the buyer in their industry.
Motorola was slow to recognize the consumer market potential for mobile telephony.
Strategic Juncture 1: At this point the shift from business to consumer adoption was in its early mode.
In 1991, The Economist predicted the widespread adoption of mobile phones.
Prices of Phones Dropping
Strategic Juncture 2: It was time to make a technology bet. But technology is not a strategy.
When Motorola missed the signs for the rapid adoption of cellular phones by consumers, it missed the early opportunity to adapt.

== Usurpation ==

Hello Adrignola. Could you please help me with [[:meta:Steward requests/SUL requests#Azeez|this request]]? Thanks in advance. [[:meta:User:Azeez|Azeez]] 04:35, 3 August 2010 (UTC)
:[[Image:Yes_check.svg|15px| ]] '''Done'''. Please visit [[w:Special:MergeAccount|Special:MergeAccount]] to unify your account after logging in here. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:56, 3 August 2010 (UTC)
== Sorry ==

Sorry for the mistake, and thanks for pointing that out. :) [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 12:53, 4 August 2010 (UTC)
== redirects ==

Dear Adrignola,

I see that someone is re-organizing the [[C++ Programming]] book,
and that you are deleting the redirects left behind.

I am happy that you are doing this under-appreciated clean-up work.
However, as [[Help:Editing#Redirecting|Wikibooks:Redirect]] points out, deleting redirects breaks links.
People search on Google, click on the link to some page in a Wikibook that used to have exactly the information they were looking for,
then they are faced with a blank edit page.

Would it be possible to hold off on deleting redirects until the next Google re-indexing,
to avoid that problem?
That way, even if the page has moved since the last Google re-indexing,
people are redirected to a more useful page.
(I hear rumors that Google re-indexes Wikibooks about once a week,
so deleting redirects around 7 days after the move is fine with me).
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 22:33, 30 July 2010 (UTC)

:Sure.  I wouldn't normally go out of my way to delete redirects, but these redirects were tagged for deletion, so that's why I took notice.  Had they not been tagged, I likely would have been in blissful ignorance of their existence. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:48, 30 July 2010 (UTC)

::Question: This is an interesting point, but has other implications. (Sorry to intrude but as the one that tagged the named redirects, I would like to understand the issue)
::I fully support some consideration toward Google (but I don't understand what guarantees or best practices should be employed in general, not in particular to these redirects). I also share the view that most of our readers come from search engines results (I did, but it is debatable if special consideration should only be given only to Goolge, even if I also share the notion that it is the most used engine). What knowledge do we have about the indexing made by Google and others? Do we know the days and depth of those indexes and do we have some sort of guarantee that they will even be updated, that would validate a special consideration ?
::I've always acted on the notion that those re-indexes were out of our control or that we couldn't have special expectations, so losing time and effort on these considerations wasn't necessary. In other words that our cleanup tasks had no other special consideration than the usefulness to our local community.  I also noted that deleted pages now have a different layout than when I started working here, for instance [[Law of three]] continue to show the destination of the redirect (even if not in a transparent way).

: ''I don't understand what guarantees or best practices should be employed in general''. Me either, but I see that the [[Help:Editing#Redirecting|Wikibooks:Redirect]] page claims that &quot;we always leave redirects in the old location to point to the new location&quot;. The person who has been using the WWW longer than anyone else once said that [http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI &quot;Cool URIs don't change&quot;].
: ''Do we know the days ... of those indexes'' If we know that most search engines re-index the internet once a week, I don't think we need to know the exact day that any particular search engine re-indexes Wikibooks -- we could assume that they all must have re-indexed Wikibooks *sometime* during a 7 day waiting period.

::I don't think it would take much effort to rework the query template for this situation.  However, note that placing a template above the redirect causes it to no longer function as a redirect and only serve as a link.  Placing a template below the redirect and causing it to continue to work does nothing, as the template is ignored.  You can see it yourself by placing {{tl|delete}} below the redirect code; the page is not added to the speedy deletion category.  So making and adding a new template changes nothing from the state of a redirect with a {{tl|delete}} on it or a deleted redirect that shows the destination of the redirect if the deleting admin did not clear the deletion summary. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 03:53, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

== Strange behaviour of an image ==

Hallo Adrignola
you recently helped me with renaming a book Question Writer 3 Manual to Question Writer Manual - and thanks very much for that.  This week I have noticed that one of the images used in the book only appears properly on the screen when I am logged in (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:QW3_Pro_star_icon.png).  When I am not logged in and to other readers(probably not logged in)only the file name appears.  All other images appear to be OK.  I know that this one image has a different license but there no note on the image to say the license is wrong ??  Do you have any suggestions what might be the issue - I did wonder if it was an problem with the new look Wikibooks?

:I moved that image to Commons since it is freely licensed.  When logged-out, you are viewing a cached version of a page, which tries to pull the image from Wikibooks.  Since I deleted it locally, it then shows a red link to the file name.  Logged in, you don't use the cache and it pulls the image from Commons.  To correct this when logged out (before the cached version expires), you can add &lt;tt&gt;?action=purge&lt;/tt&gt; to the end of the address of the page you are viewing.  I don't know offhand how often the cached version of pages is updated (other than when someone makes an edit to the page, in which case it's immediately). &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:28, 7 August 2010 (UTC)

Mike's action didn't help but he has been a valid Wikibookian, he has put work on the project, a middle ground will have to be found and even what has been said about the move on the CU flag, that seemed especially badly timed, will need to be clarified (and it also a situation that needs to be clearly covered in policy as it does cause problems).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:06, 15 August 2010 (UTC)

:::This is partially why I created the timeline at [[Wikibooks:Administrators]], to show who formerly held the tools.  We remove administrators due to inactivity and so any of the &quot;former&quot; people in that timeline, if they become active again, might be eligible again.  I do not recall anyone being involuntarily removed due to abuse, so it seems like it wouldn't be necessary to create an all-inclusive list duplicating the timeline. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 23:52, 15 August 2010 (UTC)

::::::I hope you find this comment useful.

::::::The policy of automatic removal of tools upon inactivity is one which sets up this problem. That is not a normal process on wikis, except sometimes with certain high-level privileges. Automatic removal is harmless if a removed admin can return to tool access on request.

::::::In other words, it should really be considered a suspension of tool use, to protect the wiki, without any &quot;cloud.&quot; What is a &quot;cloud&quot;? It means some reason to think that if the admin had not resigned, tool access might have been removed anyway. My own view is that &quot;cloud' should also be considered suspended if the admin resigns. (I.e., any process under way might be re-activated.) The reason is that resignation under a cloud can reduce disruption and should be encouraged. Sometimes, as well, the true nature of a situation becomes clear, later, so suspending a cloud can make it much easier to resolve.

::::::Sometimes a &quot;cloud&quot; has arisen to the point that it was reasonably clear that the tools would have been removed. With any voluntary resignation, I'd say, note should be made of any pending process or complaint, anyone could do this within a reasonable time, and a 'crat should review that upon a restoration request, and decide if a community discussion is needed before restoration. The norm, absent a cloud, would be restoration on request, restoring the status quo ante, and considerations of efficiency lead to this conclusion. We know that any active administrator may make enemies, and thus a restoration discussion is quite likely to become disruptive, even if there was no cloud at the time of resignation or suspension for lack of activity. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 15:46, 17 August 2010 (UTC)

:::::::To me the removal of tools due to inactivity is primarily to keep the list pruned, to ease the speed at which a contributor can get in contact with someone in case of an emergency.  It enables easier auditing of sysop activity with the toolserver tool (won't even load for Wikipedia because they've never pruned).  A lesser issue is that of security.  I am majoring in information technology with an additional focus on security and work part-time after classes locking things down at the campus (among other tasks).  When people graduate, they're removed.  When staff are terminated, they're removed.  So I don't mesh with all the people at Wikipedia complaining about security being a bogus rationale, because it's used in the real world.  I digress.  I don't believe there'd be a problem restoring upon request if the situation in which the tools were resigned was not controversial. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:56, 17 August 2010 (UTC)
::::::::Yes, removal makes the seeking of help more efficient, though that can be addressed by using a noticeboard to request help, instead of directing it to an individual administrator/bureaucrat. Further, there could be a separate listing of inactive administrators. The noticeboard procedure, if the noticeboard is not allowed to become a debate forum, is probably the best and most efficient, it doesn't depend on the presence of the admin you pick to ask. (it would just be a quick and efficient way to find someone to assist, and an admin &quot;answering the call&quot; would just note that (even prior to decision) and close the request, and if someone disagrees, in some way, they would then query the answering administrator or go through other process to discuss the matter somewhere else. That's crucial! A noticeboard like that should not become clogged with edits, which is what happened with AN/I on Wikipedia.)
::::::::Given this, I don't see the value of actual removal, except for the long-term security problem. Given that problem, removal for serious inactivity seems prudent, and quite harmless if the sysop can get the bit back on request. The notice to the sysop should mention this if it doesn't! Thanks for the opportunity to discuss this, I'm trying to design better procedures at Wikiversity and it helps me. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 18:02, 17 August 2010 (UTC)

I believe another rational used for pruning inactive administrators is that the community changes over time and administrators gone awhile cannot be expected to know current community expectations, and could potentially use the tools in ways that harm the community or are no longer considered acceptable if they were allowed to keep the tools indefinitely. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:33, 17 August 2010 (UTC)

There was one inactive administrator where changes in expectation lead to disapproval of how an administrator used the tools when they came back, but the community consensus was to wait out inactivity instead of removing the tools immediately. Any former administrator can request the tools again without prejudice, but AFAIK that hasn't happened yet so that part of the policy has never been tested. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:46, 17 August 2010 (UTC)

I don't expect to be doing any more work on those old book topics. For that reason I invite anyone to consider deleting them. I am indifferent on whether they are kept or not. [[User:PullUpYourSocks|PullUpYourSocks]] ([[User talk:PullUpYourSocks|talk]]) 13:36, 18 August 2010 (UTC)

== voting ==

Hi Adrignola,
*I have a question: Is there an edit limit for voting? If yes, what is the limit? Thanks in advance. [[User:Srhat|Srhat]] ([[User talk:Srhat|talk]]) 21:23, 19 August 2010 (UTC)

*:How about at least 50 edits and registered for at least two months?  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:46, 19 August 2010 (UTC)

**Thank you :) I just couldn't find the page explaining this. [[User:Srhat|Srhat]] ([[User talk:Srhat|talk]]) 21:52, 19 August 2010 (UTC)

[[Wikibooks:Decision making]] seems to have dropped the edit and registration restrictions way back. Is this about the voting for checkuser? Are there special meta requirements? (Beyond verification of ID.) I'm thinking I'll go !vote since I do intend to become active here. With books. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 00:33, 20 August 2010 (UTC)

:Locally we don't have any restrictions and we really don't need them. I doubt this process needs any special consideration since it is only a call for demonstrated confidence (not really a vote), since every user will be affected by the decision, therefore any registered users should be able to participate and any objection (even of unregistered users) would be considered, since it is a decision covered by our policy for consensus, with some added external requirements (due to the nature of the tool).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:03, 20 August 2010 (UTC)

:(edit conflict) Well, I actually think there ''isn't'' a page that has any requirements.  Our major permissions discussions have always revolved around consensus, so bureaucrats would use common sense and discount any unregistered/new users' opinions in the discussions when looking at an admin/'crat candidate.  The requirements imposed by Meta for electing a CheckUser here forcing it to be a vote go against the Wikibooks grain, so to speak.  Meta's requirements are for a minimum number of support votes ''and'' those support votes need to make up a certain percentage of the total.  Wikis with ArbComs can set their own procedures. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 01:05, 20 August 2010 (UTC)
== CheckUser ==

I have restored your checkuser tools here since the project has now two checkusers again, as per policy. Regards, [[User:Dferg|Dferg]] ([[User talk:Dferg|talk]]) 17:01, 21 August 2010 (UTC)
== excuse me ==

but weren't you supposed to suppress the redirect in [[1945 The United States uses atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 10:08, 23 August 2010 (UTC)

:There's nothing that says I ''have'' to.  Given that it was recently being worked on, I didn't want the anonymous contributor (who will have a harder time looking at their contributions to see where the page went) to wonder what happened to the page.  Since it has been some time now, I have deleted the redirect.  I didn't know that failing to suppress it in that move three days ago would bother you. :) &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:07, 23 August 2010 (UTC)
== [[Template:Collection]] ==

Could you take a look at [[:Template:Collection]]?  It got way big on me, and now it chops off the word the first word in the book title (Adventist), and leads to an error page.  I see this in the following sections of my book:
* [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Outdoor Industries]]
* [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts]]
* [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature]]
* [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Health and Science]]
* [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Household Arts]]
* [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Outreach]]
Since you were the last to edit it, I thought maybe you'd be up to tackling the problem.  Thanks! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:33, 25 August 2010 (UTC)

:Fixed.  The manually-specified parameter wasn't properly encoded. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 01:52, 25 August 2010 (UTC)

== I edited your closing sentence at VfD ==

Just to point out that I just edited you action on [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]], some words were out of order.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 13:42, 30 August 2010 (UTC)
:That's a perfectly good word order; &quot;the user is paying X no heed&quot;, X=&quot;attempts to reason with them&quot;.  I de-redacted it (no offense to anyone involved, I hope).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:08, 30 August 2010 (UTC)
::&quot;This is in line with vandalism and the user is paying attempts to reason with them no heed.&quot; to me it doesn't seem correct and takes an effort to make sense of it, but I defer to you on such things. The separation created from the action and the qualifier creates unnecessary confusion, a clearer variation would be &quot;the user is paying, to the attempts to reason with him, no heed.&quot; resolving the problem caused by unnecessary &quot;them&quot;...

:::English is my native language and so I've no doubt that some of my sentence structures might be of a complex nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Assigning users to sites, why and how ==
=== Introduction ===
Most of the OpenClinica users will start experimenting with OpenClinica on a stand-alone machine, doing everything as &quot;root&quot;. But as soon as things get serious and more users are involved an installation on a server is required. And different user-access-levels are what you want: you'll create some users as data-entry persons, some as Monitor, etc.
All this is quite straight forward and we won't get into detail, but one thing is not so obvious: how do you assign users to sites? And first of all: why should you?

=== Why assign users to sites? ===
That's an easy one: because you are required to do so. It is good clinical practice to limit what (trained) users can do to the subjects they are responsible for. And the other way round: to ensure that only authorized people can access and edit the data. Even if you're not very much interested in GCP: it is safer to limit user's access to their &quot;own&quot; subjects. And even if you're not interested in &quot;safer&quot;: your sites will like it if they can be sure others can't access or edit &quot;their&quot; data.

=== How do you assign users to sites? ===
In these instructions we will set up for study with &quot;Unique Protocol ID&quot; TDS006, two data-entry-persons UserA and UserB for sites A (Amsterdam) and B (Barcelona). 

=== Creating two sites and naming them ===
Start with creating the sites. This is done in &quot;Tasks&quot;-&quot;Build Study&quot; menu option. In the Build-Study-screen this is task number 6 &quot;Create sites&quot;. Just click on the plus-sign in the right column and fill in the details of the sites that will participate. It is not obligatory to fill in everything, but as usual, you must complete the items with an asterisk. (And it's convenient to give &quot;Facility City:&quot;, because this is used as your default location when creating a new event.) 
Use for Site Name &quot;TDS006 Amsterdam&quot; and not just &quot;Amsterdam&quot; and use for the Unique Protocol ID &quot;TDS006_A&quot;. Using your Study OID in the name of your site will help you, when you will look at your user-list later. And using it in the Protocol ID will make it easier to keep it unique.

=== Switching from study to site ===
You may not have realized this, but the above steps can only be done if your &quot;current study&quot; is the study as a whole. &quot;What else can it be?&quot; you may think, but if you click the menu option in the top of your screen, left of the middle, called &quot;Change Study/Site&quot;, you'll get a choice of studies and under your current study you will see your two new sites &quot;TDS006 Amsterdam&quot; and &quot;TDS006 Barcelona&quot;. Choose site &quot;TDS006 Amsterdam&quot;. You must now click the button labeled &quot;Confirm study&quot;, which sounds odd, as you don't switch to a study, but to a site. But to a very deep level studies and sites are the same! (We will not discuss the consequences here, but this means among other things that you can use different versions of a CRF as default for different sites. Or you can hide CRF's for one site and show it to another. Or you can lock or freeze a site.)
You'll now see &quot;Confirm Changing Study You are choosing to switch to the study: TDS006 Amsterdam with a role of Study Director.&quot; Click the button &quot;Confirm&quot;. In the top of your screen you now see the name of your study, plus the name of your site.
If you go to menu option &quot;Tasks&quot;-&quot;Study Setup&quot; the menu option &quot;Build Study&quot; has disappeared. 

=== Creating two new users and assigning them ===
Next thing to do is create two users: UserA and UserB. You do this in menu-option &quot;Tasks&quot;-&quot;Administration&quot;-&quot;Users&quot; (and not in &quot;Tasks&quot;-&quot;Study Setup&quot;-&quot;Users&quot;). Create the two accounts and choose for &quot;Active Study&quot; not the whole study, but one site. Again: very easy. 

=== Assigning existing users ===
If you want to assign existing users to new study-sites, this procedure is slightly different. If you did not already switch to &quot;TDS006 Amsterdam&quot; as described above, do so now. Then you use &quot;Tasks&quot;-&quot;Administration&quot;-&quot;Users&quot;. The screen is titled &quot;Manage All Users In TDS006 Amsterdam&quot;. Click on &quot;Assign new user to current study&quot; and notice that here again the term &quot;study&quot; is used and not &quot;site&quot;. A list of all available users is displayed: scroll through the pages for your user and choose as Role &quot;Clinical Research Coordinator&quot; (if you need a data-entry-person) and check the box in the column &quot;selected&quot;. Click button &quot;Submit&quot; and you're ready. To assign UserB to Barcelona, first switch Study/Site to &quot;TDS006 Barcelona&quot; and repeat the other steps.

To see the results, go to menu option &quot;Tasks&quot;-&quot;Administration&quot;-&quot;Users&quot;. In the list of users, you will see for UserA &quot;TDS006 Amsterdam&quot;, among other studies and sites. If you're consequent in your naming of sites, you will have no difficulty in distinguishing between studies and sites.

The following hardware has been tested with AROS and any issues have been noted. If you have encountered differently (i.e. problems, incompatibilities, faults, niggles, annoyances, environment, errors, review of setup etc) please update this information. 



=== Laptops ===

Currently, the minimum for consistently good results on laptops / notebooks is centrino or the AMD equivalent as well as recent atom or amd fusion (i.e. around 1Ghz or higher). 


* Dell Latitude D-series laptops - high quality business class machines, some support in Aros, easy to replace wifi card 
* For the tiny carry anywhere, the first incarnation of Acer Aspire netbooks 


Please bear in mind that AROS has hardware driver developers that you could count on a one or two hands, whilst Linux counts in the tens and Windows in the hundreds. So support is patchy at times but shows some improvement after 2005/6 for a few years. So consequently, be aware that drivers support on native is usually a few years or more behind linux, MacOS(TM) and Windows(TM). 

Taking a random laptop / notebook you can expect the following 
&lt;pre&gt;

The best option at the moment for Pentium 1, PentiumII or early P3 PentiumIII based notebook machines is to run a small linux distro like [http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/index.php?f=35&amp;sid=1d4923f0c58f5e40e1323039ebd97122 puppy] 214X, 215CE and host AROS on top. AROS can exist on a Windows(TM) install as well. See here for more information [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=3843&amp;forum=24&amp;post_id=35472#forumpost35472 Linux hosted] and [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?start=170&amp;topic_id=3017&amp;viewmode=flat&amp;order=ASC Windows hosted] with downloads here [http://aros.sourceforge.net/download.php AROS download page]

Try to avoid dedicated discrete graphics options from Nvidia or Ati as the BGA solder joints tend to fail sooner or later. The latest AMD socketed APU should resolve this but as they are now concentrated on the cheaper end of the market so build quality issues may come into play (time will tell). 

Most vendor suppliers get OEM (original equipment manufacturers) to make their laptops. These brand name companies purchase their laptops from an ODM (Original Design Manufacturer) such as Quanta, Compal, Wistron, Inventec, Foxconn (Hon Hai), Flextronics and Asus (now Pegatron) with together 80% market share and MiTAC, FIC, Arima, Uniwill, ECS and Clevo (remaining 20%).

===Motherboard===

Since 2001, a growing number of motherboards (now a very large percentage) have added functionality implemented on the motherboard meaning that less PCI, AGP and PCI-E slots are now used or appear. 

Most Intel Atom and equivalent AMD Fusion CPUs are faster than Intel P3s but still some way short of P4 or Dual Core performance. 


* Late 2002, USB2.0 added and slightly better AROS sound support (AC97) appeared 
* 2002-2005 and still, to a limited extent, ongoing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor_plague bad capacitors] 
* Late 2003, ATX PSUs moved from 5V to 12v rails BEING IMPORTANT (extra 4pin on motherboard for CPU) 


* Late 2005, PCI Express replaced AGP and HDAudio replaced AC97 
* Late 2007, ATX PSUs added extra 12V PCI-E connectors and 4+4pin for CPUs 
* Late 2010, USB3.0 appears on motherboards or needing a PCI-E motherboard slot

==Introduction==


Created originally on this [http://amigaworld.net/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?mode=viewtopic&amp;topic_id=30859&amp;forum=28&amp;start=380&amp;viewmode=flat&amp;order=0#543705 thread] on amigaworld.net  and [http://aadb.amiga.me/data/content.html here] and  [http://amifind.platon42.de/cgi-bin/amifind?query=personal+paint&amp;dir=-1&amp;mode=and aminet search]. 

Aros does have some software. Windows, MacOSX and Linux have a lot more software but in every day use how much do you use. The most used apps that most people use on a daily basis are...



* Web browser AROS - using Fab's Odyssey or the original AROS OWB 
* Email AROS - using YAM and SimpleMAIL 
* Web Chat AROS - Facebook and Twitter via jabberwocky 
* Video playback AROS - yes via mplayer 
* Audio Playback AROS - yes via mplayer 
* Games AROS - some ported games plus lots of emulation software and HTML5 casual ones while we wait for native games. 
* Office - On-line apps could also be used via the OWB web browser, like Google Docs. 



;ABIv0 is the current but soon to be old standard for AROS 
;ABIv1 is going to be the newest standard for AROS 



There is still a lot of software to be ported or written so if you are interested in joining in with this effort see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Developer/Docs here]

==Various Application Guides==


===Web Browser===

====Fab's Odyssey OWB ====

Slow internet experience can be improved by deleting cookies.db 

Even simpler, add ezdownload.js to the scripts list just like youtube.js next. To use Youtube, OWB Settings-&gt;Scripts add youtube.js and then each Youtube play website will show a series of numbers. First set are for download, next with Flash and finally without Flash. It should highlight which are which.

The higher the number the better the quality and size. Numbers seem to go in order from a series of flv files, to a series of vp8 and finally h264 files. Google likes breaking Youtube support often and [http://fabportnawak.free.fr/owb/scripts/ new .js scripts] sometimes appear. 

If you have 1gb of memory or more, copy the browser directory to ram and run the browser environment there - saves hard disk wear and tear 
Create User-Startup text file or add the following to this file in SYSːs drawer... i.e. creating a script 


&lt;pre &gt;
stack 100000

; using AspireOS 
copy FROM SYS:Extras/Networking/Odyssey_Web_Browser/ TO RAM:OWB ALL CLONE &gt; Nil:

; using Icaros Desktop (line below may need further editing by removing the ; below) 
; copy FROM SYS:Tools/Odyssey_Web_Browser/ TO RAM:OWB ALL CLONE &gt; Nil:

cd RAM:OWB
run OWB &gt; Nil:
&lt;/pre &gt;





==== AROS Orygyn OWB ====






===E-Mail ===

====YAM====

[http://www.freelists.org/list/yam YAM Freelists] 

 Use of on-line e-mail accounts with AROS based email clients limited by lack of OpenSSL AmiSSl v3 compatible library 

=====GMail =====
Incoming Mail (POP3) Server - requires SSL: pop.gmail.com
Use SSL: Yes
Port: 995

Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server - requires TLS: smtp.gmail.com (use authentication)
Use Authentication: Yes
Use STARTTLS: Yes (some clients call this SSL)
Port: 465 or 587

Account Name: your Gmail username (including '@gmail.com')
Email Address: your full Gmail email address (username@gmail.com)
Password: your Gmail password

Anyway, the SMTP is pop.gmail.com port 465 and it uses SSLLv3 Authentication. The POP3 settings are for the same server (pop.gmail.com), only on port 995 instead. 



=====Outlook.com access =====

&lt;pre &gt;
Outlook.com SMTP server address: smtp.live.com
Outlook.com SMTP user name: Your full Outlook.com email address (not an alias)
Outlook.com SMTP password: Your Outlook.com password
Outlook.com SMTP port: 587
Outlook.com SMTP TLS/SSL encryption required: yes 
&lt;/pre &gt; 



=====Yahoo  Mail =====

&lt;pre &gt;
“POP3 Server” – Set the POP server for incoming mails as pop.mail.yahoo.com. You will have to enable “SSL” and use 995 for Port.
“SMTP Server” – Set the SMTP server for outgoing mails as smtp.mail.yahoo.com. You will also have to make sure that “SSL” is enabled and use 465 for port. you must also enable “authentication” for this to work.
“Account Name or Login Name” – Your Yahoo Mail ID i.e. your email address without the domain “@yahoo.com”.
“Email Address” – Your Yahoo Mail address i.e. your email address including the domain “@yahoo.com”. E.g. myname@yahoo.com
“Password” – Your Yahoo Mail password.
&lt;/pre &gt; 

Yahoo! Mail Plus users may have to set POP server as plus.pop.mail.yahoo.com and SMTP server as plus.smtp.mail.yahoo.com.

Note that you need to enable “Web &amp; POP Access” in your Yahoo Mail account to send and receive Yahoo Mail messages through any other email program.

You will have to enable “Allow your Yahoo Mail to be POPed” under “POP and Forwarding”, to send and receive Yahoo mails through any other email client. 

Cannot be done since 2002 unless the customer pays Yahoo a monthly fee to have access to SMTP and POP3 



=====Microsoft Outlook Express Mail =====

1. Get the files to your PC.
By whatever method get the files off your Amiga onto your PC. In the YAM folder you have a number of different folders, one for each of your folders in YAM. Inside that is a file usually some numbers such as 332423.283. YAM created a new file for every single email you received.

2. Open up a brand new Outlook Express. Just configure the account to use 127.0.0.1 as mail servers. It doesnt really matter. You will need to manually create any subfolders you used in YAM.

3. You will need to do a mass rename on all your email files from YAM. Just add a .eml to the end of it. Amazing how PCs still rely mostly on the file name so it knows what sort of file it is rather than just looking at it! There are a number of multiple renamers online to download and free too.

4. Go into each of your folders, inbox, sent items etc. And do a select all then drag the files into Outlook Express (to the relevent folder obviously) Amazingly the file format that YAM used is very compatible with .eml standard and viola your emails appear. With correct dates and working attachments.

5. If you want your email into Microsoft Outlook. Open that up and create a new profile and a new blank PST file. Then go into File Import and choose to import from Outlook Express. And the mail will go into there. And viola.. you have your old email from your Amiga in a more modern day format.






====SimpleMail email client ====

[http://www.freelists.org/list/simplemail-usr User list] 

 Use of on-line e-mail accounts with AROS based email clients limited by lack of OpenSSL AmiSSL v3 compatible library 



If you use TTF fonts and have installed the MSFonts (Arial etc.) the trouble is that SimpleHTML will use those TTF fonts and the HTML mail will ask for them in such a size that it is unreadable on the amiga (OS4 will probably have better luck), the solution would be to have simplehtml not allow sizes under a certain size or update the SimpleHTML to handle &lt;FONT SIZE=xx&gt; fully 

for instance this
&lt;FONT SIZE=&quot;-2&quot; FACE=&quot;Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;Retrieve email using your device&lt;BR&gt; ($49.99)&lt;/FONT&gt; 

is getting translated to a unreadable Verdana font in size 9 if you have the MS Fonts installed, SimpleHTML does not support negative sizes in the SimpleHTML.config file (in any logical way at least).

this is how my SimpleHTML.config looks like

&lt;/pre &gt; 



=====GMail =====
gmail pop/smtp config:

Be sure to activate the pop3 in your gmail account.
pop3:
pop.gmail.com
Use SSL: Yes
Port: 995

smtp:
smtp.gmail.com (with authentication)
Use Authentication: Yes
Use SSL: Yes
Port: 465 or 587

Be sure that you change the pop3 and the smpt tcp ports! I don't know if YAM or simplemail can be configured like this.

If you dont need encryption then it works fine afaik. If you want to use encryption, it needs ssl. So to keep it simple, yes if you want to use secure sockets (ssl) than it is useless for you (atm).

=====Microsoft Mail =====



=====Yahoo  Mail =====

“POP3 Server” – Set the POP server for incoming mails as pop.mail.yahoo.com. You will have to enable “SSL” and use 995 for Port.
“SMTP Server” – Set the SMTP server for outgoing mails as smtp.mail.yahoo.com. You will also have to make sure that “SSL” is enabled and use 465 for port. you must also enable “authentication” for this to work.

“Email Address” – Your Yahoo Mail address i.e. your email address including the domain “@yahoo.com”. E.g. myname@yahoo.com
“Password” – Your Yahoo Mail password.
Yahoo! Mail Plus users may have to set POP server as plus.pop.mail.yahoo.com and SMTP server as plus.smtp.mail.yahoo.com.

Note that you need to enable “Web &amp; POP Access” in your Yahoo Mail account to send and receive Yahoo Mail messages through any other email program.

You will have to enable “Allow your Yahoo Mail to be POPed” under “POP and Forwarding”, to send and receive Yahoo mails through any other email client. 

Cannot be done since 2002 unless the customer pays Yahoo a subscription subs fee to have access to SMTP and POP3 





===Instant Messaging IM ===


====IRC Internet Relay Chat====

Just type a message in ''lowercase''' letters and it will be posted to all in the [http://irc1.netsplit.de/channels/details.php?room=%23aros&amp;net=freenode AROS channel]. Please do not use UPPER CASE as it is a sign of SHOUTING which is annoying. 

Other things to type in - replace &lt;message&gt; with a line of text and &lt;nick&gt; with a person's name 

&lt;pre&gt;
/help 

/list 

/who
/whois &lt;nick&gt;

/msg &lt;nick&gt; &lt;message&gt;

/query &lt;nick&gt; 
&lt;message&gt;s
/query

/away &lt;message&gt;
/away 

/quit &lt;going away message&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;


[http://irchelp.org/irchelp/new2irc.html#smiley Intro guide here].

Issue the command /me &lt;text&gt; where &lt;text&gt; is the text that should follow your nickname.
Example: /me slaps ajk around a bit with a large trout 

/nick &lt;newNick&gt; 

/nickserv register &lt;password&gt; &lt;email address&gt; 

/ns instead of /nickserv, while others might need /msg nickserv 

/nickserv identify &lt;password&gt;

Alternatives:
/ns identify &lt;password&gt;
/msg nickserv identify &lt;password&gt;

Enter channel #team*amiga and you're done. Recently the channel has started hosting regular Q&amp;A sessions. 


BitlBee and Minbif are IRCd-like gateways to multiple IM networks (new server being im.bitlbee.org im.bitlbee.org:6667 ) working with WookieChat. Seems to be most useful on WookieChat as you can be connected to several servers at once. 
One for Bitlbee and any messages that might come through that. One for your normal IRC chat server.

=====Aircos =====

Double click on Aircos icon in Extras:Networking/Apps/Aircos. It has been set up with a guest account for trial purposes. Though ideally, choose a nickname and password for frequent use of irc. 






====Jabberwocky====

Jabberwocky is ideal for one-to-one social media communication, use IRC if you require one to many. You sign up to a server that someone else has setup and access chat services through them. [http://blog.movieos.org/2007/10/running-a-jabber-server-with-ejabberd/ Servers] are setup and close down at random so see the below lists for current servers. 

The two ways to access chat from jabberwocky
&lt;pre &gt;
Jabberwocky -&gt; Server -&gt; XMPP -&gt; 
Jabberwocky -&gt; Server -&gt; Transports (Gateways) -&gt; 
&lt;/pre &gt;

The Jabber.org service connects with all IM services that use XMPP, the open standard for instant messaging and presence over the Internet. The services we connect with include Google Talk, Live Journal Talk, Nimbuzz, Ovi, and thousands more. However, you can not connect from Jabber.org to proprietary services like AIM, ICQ, MSN, Skype, or Yahoo because they don’t yet use XMPP components (XEP-0114) '''but''' you can use Jabber.com's servers and IM gateways (MSN, ICQ, Yahoo etc) instead. 

Unfortunately jabberwocky can only connect to one server at a time. so if you set it up with separate facebook and google talk accounts, for example, sometimes you'll only get one or the other. 

The best way to use jabberwocky is in conjunction with a public jabber server with '''transports''' to your favorite services, like gtalk, facebook, yahoo, ICQ, AIM, etc. 


You have to register with one of the servers, [http://www.jaim.at/server/server_by_gateway_xmpp.html gateway list with icons], [https://list.jabber.at/ this list] or [http://www.jabberes.org/servers/ another list], [http://xmpp.net/ this security XMPP list], 

Jabberwocky open a window where the Jabber server part is typed in as well as your Nickname and Password. 

Jabber ID (JID) identifies you to the server and other users. 

Once registered the next step is to goto Jabberwocky's &quot;Windows&quot; menu and select the &quot;Agents&quot; option. The &quot;Agents List&quot; window will open. 

Roster (contacts list) 

[http://search.wensley.org.uk/ Chatrooms] (MUC) are available 

File Transfer - can send and receive files through the Jabber service but not with other services like IRC, ICQ, AIM or Yahoo. All you need is an installed webbrowser and OpenURL. 

Clickable URLs - The message window uses Mailtext.mcc and you can set a URL action in the MUI mailtext prefs like SYS:Utils/OpenURL %s NEWWIN. 



There is no consistent Skype like (H.323 VoIP) video conferencing available over Jabber. The move from xmpp to Jingle should help but no support on any amiga-like systems at the moment. [http://aminet.net/package/dev/src/AmiPhoneSrc192 AmiPhone] and [http://www.lysator.liu.se/%28frame,faq,nobg,useframes%29/ahi/v4-site/ Speak Freely] was an early attempt voice only contact. SIP and Asterisk are other PBX options. 




=====Facebook=====

If you're using the XMPP transport provided by facebook themselves, chat.facebook.com, it looks like they're now requiring SSL transport. This means jabberwocky method below will no longer work. The best thing to do is to create an ID on a public jabber server which has a facebook gateway. 

&lt;pre &gt;
1. launch jabberwocky
2. if the login window doesn't appear on launch, select 'account' from the jabberwocky menu
3. your jabber ID will be user@chat.facebook.com where user is your user ID
4. your password is your normal facebook password
5. to save this for next time, click the popup gadget next to the ID field

6. click the 'add' button
7. click the 'close' button
8. click the 'connect' button
&lt;/pre &gt;

you're done. you can also click the 'save as default account' button if you want. jabberwocky configured to auto-connect when launching the program, but you can configure as you like. there is amigaguide documentation included with jabberwocky. 

[http://amigaworld.net/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=37085&amp;forum=32 Read more here] 

for facebook users, you can log-in directly to facebook with jabberwocky. just sign in as @chat.facebook.com with your facebook password as the password



=====Google Talk=====

any XMPP server will work, but you have to add your contacts manually. a google talk user is typically either @gmail.com or @talk.google.com. a true gtalk transport is nice because it brings your contacts to you and (can) also support file transfers to/from google talk users. 





=====Twitter=====

For a few years, there has been added a twitter transport. Servers include [http://jabber.hot-chilli.net/ jabber.hot-chili.net],  and . 

An [http://jabber.hot-chilli.net/tag/how-tos/ How-to] 

:Read [http://jabber.hot-chilli.net/2010/05/09/twitter-transport-working/ more]



=====ICQ=====

The new version (beta) of StriCQ uses a newer ICQ protocol. Most of the ICQ Jabber Transports still use an older ICQ protocol. You can only talk one-way to StriCQ using the older Transports. Only the newer ICQv7 Transport lets you talk both ways to StriCQ. Look at the server lists in the first section to check. 

Register on a Jabber server, e.g. this one works: http://www.jabber.de/
Then login into Jabberwocky with the following login data e.g. xxx@jabber.de / Password: xxx Now add your ICQ account under the window-&gt;Agents-&gt;&quot;Register&quot;. Now Jabberwocky connects via the Jabber.de server with your ICQ account.




=====Yahoo Messenger=====

To do 



=====MSN=====

 early months of 2013 Microsoft will ditch MSN Messenger client and force everyone to use Skype...
 but MSN protocol and servers will keep working as usual for quite a long time.... 

Occasionally the Messenger servers have been experiencing problems signing in.  You may need to sign in at www.outlook.com and then try again.  It may also take multiple tries to sign in.  (This also affects you if you’re using Skype.)

You have to check each servers' Agents List to see what transports (MSN protocol, ICQ protocol, etc) are supported or use the list address' provided in the section above. Then register with each transport (IRC, MSN, ICQ, etc) to which you need access. After registering you can Connect to start chatting. 

msn.jabber.com/registered should appear in the window. 

From this [http://tech.dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/amiga-jabberwocky/message/1378 JW group] guide which  helps with this process in a clear, step by step procedure. 

1. Sign up on MSN's site for a passport account. This typically involves getting a Hotmail address. 

2. Log on to the Jabber server of your choice and do the following:

* Select the &quot;Windows/Agents&quot; menu option in Jabberwocky.
* Select the MSN Agent from the list presented by the server.
* Click the Register button to open a new window asking for:
**Username = passort account email address, typically your hotmail address.
**Nick = Screen name to be shown to anyone you add to your buddy list.
**Password = Password for your passport account/hotmail address.
* Click the Register button at the bottom of the new window.

3. If all goes well, you will see the MSN Gateway added to your buddy list. If not, repeat part 2 on another server. Some servers may show MSN in their list of available agents, but have not updated their software for the latest protocols used by MSN. 

4. Once you are registered, you can now add people to your buddy list. Note that you need to include the '''msn.''' ahead of the servername so that it knows what gateway agent to use. Some servers may use a slight variation and require '''msg.gate.''' before the server name, so try both to see what works. 

If my friend's msn was amiga@hotmail.co.uk and my jabber server was @jabber.meta.net.nz..
then amiga'''%'''hotmail.com@'''msn.'''jabber.meta.net.nz

or another the trick to import MSN contacts is that you don't type the hotmail URL but the passport URL... eg. Instead of: goodvibe%hotmail.com@msn.jabber.com  You type: goodvibe%passport.com@msn.jabber.com 
And the thing about importing contacts I'm afraid you'll have to do it by hand, one at the time...

====Frying Pan ====

backup dvds (4GB ISO size limit due to use of FileInfoBlock), create audio cds from mp3's, and put .iso files on discs

If using for the first time - click Drive button and Device set to ata.device and unit to 0 (zero)  

Click Tracks Button - Drive 1 - Create New Disc or Import Existing Disc Image (iso bin/cue etc) - Session File open cue file 

If you're making a data cd, with files and drawers from your hard drive, you should be using the ISO Builder.. which is the MUI page on the left. (&quot;Data/Audio Tracks&quot; is on the right).

You should use the &quot;Data/Audio tracks&quot; page if you want to create music cds with AIFF/WAV/MP3 files, or if you download an .iso file, and you want to put it on a cd. 

Click WRITE Button - set write speed - click on long Write button 



Examples 

Easiest way would be to burn a DATA CD, simply go to &quot;Tracks&quot; page &quot;ISO Builder&quot; and &quot;ADD&quot; everything you need to burn. 

On the &quot;Write&quot; page i have &quot;Masterize Disc (DAO)&quot;, &quot;Close Disc&quot; and &quot;Eject after Write&quot; set. 

One must not &quot;Blank disc before write&quot; if one uses a CDR 


AUDIO CD from MP3's are as easy but tricky to deal with. FP only understands one MP3 format, Layer II, everything else will just create
empty tracks 

Burning bootable CD's works only with .iso files. Go to &quot;Tracks&quot; page and &quot;Data/Audio Tracks&quot; and add the .iso 





====Audio Evolution 4====

The number of tracks per project(s) is unlimited .... AHI limits you to recording only two at a time. ie not on 8 track sound cards like the Juli@ or Phase 88.

Assign PageStream: &quot;Work:PageStream3&quot;
Assign SoftLogik: &quot;PageStream:SoftLogik&quot;
Assign Fonts: &quot;PageStream:SoftLogik/Fonts&quot; ADD
&lt;/pre &gt;

Normally Pagestream Fonts are installed in directory Pagestream3:Fonts/. Next step is to mark the right fonts-path in Pagestream's Systemprefs (don't confuse softlogik.font - this is only a screen-systemfont). Installed them all in a NEW Pagestream/Fonts drawer - every font-family in its own separate directory and marked them in PageStream3/Systemprefs for each family entry. e.g. Project &gt; System Preferences &gt;Fonts. You simply enter the path where the fonts are located into the Default Drawer string. e.g System:PageStream/Fonts
Then you click on Add and add a drawer. Then you hit Update. Then you hit Save. The new font(s) are available. 

If everything went ok font &quot;triumvirate-normal&quot; should be chosen automatically when typing text. Kerning and leading 

Normally, only use postscript fonts (Adobe Type 1 - both metric file .afm or .pfm variant and outline file .pfb) because easier to print to postscript printers and these fonts give the best results and printing is fast! Double sided printing.

====Ignition - Amiga Spreadsheet====

; Needs ABIv1 to be completed (2012?) before more can be done 

File formats supported 
* ascii #?.txt and #?.csv (single sheets with data only). 
* igs and TurboCalc(WIP) #?.tc for all sheets with data, formats and formulas. 

There is '''no''' support for xls, xlsx, ods or uos ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Office_Format Uniform Unified Office Format]) yet. 



* Always use Esc key after editing Spreadsheet cells.
* copy/paste seems to copy the first instance only so go to Edit -&gt; Clipboard to manage the list of remembered actions. 
* Right mouse click on row (1 or 2 or 3) or column header (a or b or c)  to access optimal height or width of the row or column respectively 
* Edit -&gt; Insert -&gt; Row  seems to clear the spreadsheet or clears the rows after the inserted row until undo restores as it should be...

Change Sheet name by  Object -&gt; Sheet -&gt; Properties 

Click in the cell which will contain the result, and click '''down arrow button''' to the right of the formula box at the bottom of the spreadsheet and choose the function required from the list provided. Then click on the start cell and click on the bottom right corner, a '''very''' small blob, which allows stretching a bounding box (thick grey outlines) across many cells This grey bounding box can be used to '''copy a formula''' to other cells. 

Object -&gt; Cell -&gt; Properties to change cell format - Currency only covers DM and not $, Euro, Renminbi, Yen or Pound etc. 
Shift key and arrow keys selects a range of cells, so that '''formatting can be done to all highlighted cells'''. 
View -&gt; Overview then select ALL with one click (in empty cell in the top left hand corner of the sheet). 

Default mode is relative cell referencing e.g. a1+a2 but absolute e.g. $a$1+$a$2 can be entered. 

* #sheet-name to '''absolute''' reference another sheet-name cell unless reference() function used.

Every ODF file is a collection of several subdocuments within a package (ZIP file), each of which stores part of the complete document. 

* content.xml – Document content and automatic styles used in the content.
* styles.xml – Styles used in the document content and automatic styles used in the styles themselves.
* meta.xml – Document meta information, such as the author or the time of the last save action.
* settings.xml – Application-specific settings, such as the window size or printer information.


To read document follow these steps:

* Extracting .ods file.
* Getting content.xml file (which contains sheets data).
* Creating XmlDocument object from content.xml file.
* Creating DataSet (that represent Spreadsheet file).
* With XmlDocument select “table:table” elements, and then create adequate DataTables.
* Parse child’s of “table:table” element and fill DataTables with those data.
* At the end, return DataSet and show it in application’s interface. 


To write document follow these steps:

* Extracting template.ods file (.ods file that we use as template).
* Getting content.xml file.
* Creating XmlDocument object from content.xml file.
* Erasing all “table:table” elements from the content.xml file.
* Reading data from our DataSet and composing adequate “table:table” elements.
* Adding “table:table” elements to content.xml file.
* Zipping that file as new .ods file.



XLS file format 

The XLS file format contains streams, substreams, and records. 

These sheet substreams include worksheets, macro sheets, chart sheets, dialog sheets, and VBA module sheets. 
All the records in an XLS document start with a 2-byte unsigned integer to specify Record Type (rt), and another for Count of Bytes (cb). A record cannot exceed 8224 bytes. If larger then the rest is stored in one or more continue records. 

* Workbook stream 
**Globals substream
***BoundSheet8 record - info for Worksheet substream i.e. name, location, type, and visibility. (4bytes the lbPlyPos FilePointer, specifies the position in the Workbook stream where the sheet substream starts) 
**Worksheet substream (sheet) - Cell Table - Row record - Cells (2byte=row 2byte=column 2byte=XF format)
***Blank cell record
***RK cell record 32-bit number. 
***BoolErr cell record (2-byte Bes structure that may be either a Boolean value or an error code)
***Number cell record (64-bit floating-point number)
***LabelSst cell record (4-byte integer that specifies a string in the Shared Strings Table (SST). Specifically, the integer corresponds to the array index in the RGB field of the SST)
***Formula cell record (FormulaValue structure in the 8 bytes that follow the cell structure. The next 6 bytes can be ignored, and the rest of the record is a CellParsedFormula structure that contains the formula itself)
***MulBlank record (first 2 bytes give the row, and the next 2 bytes give the column that the series of blanks starts at. Next, a variable length array of cell structures follows to store formatting information, and the last 2 bytes show what column the series of blanks ends on)
***MulRK record 
***Shared String Table (SST) contains all of the string values in the workbook.

====Scandal====

Scanner usually needs to be connected via a usb port and not via a hub or extension lead. 

Check in Trident Prefs -&gt; Devices that the USB Scanner is not bound to anything (e.g. Bindings None)
If not found then reboot the computer and recheck. 

Start Scandal, choose Settings from Menu strip at top of screen and in Scanner Driver choose the ?#.device of the scanner (e.g epson2.device). 

The next two boxes - leave empty as they are for morphos SCSI use only
 or put ata.device (use the selection option in bigger box below) and Unit as 0 this is needed for gt68xx 

* gt68xx - no editing needed in s/gt68xx.conf but needs a firmware file that corresponds to the scanner [http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/gt68xx-backend/ gt68xx firmwares] in sys:s/gt68xx. 

* epson2 - Need to edit the file epson2.conf in sys/s that corresponds to the scanner being used 

'''Save''' the settings but do not press the Use button (aros freezes) 

Back to the Picture Scan window and the right-hand sections. 

Click on the '''Information''' tab and press Connect button and the scanner should now be detected. 

Go next to the '''Scanner''' tab next to Information Tab should have Color, Black and White, etc and dpi settings now. Selecting an option Color, B/W etc can cause dpi settings corruption (especially if the settings are in one line) so set '''dpi first'''. Make sure if Preview is set or not. 

In the '''Scan''' Tab, press Scan and the scanner will do its duty. 
Be aware that nothing is saved to disk yet. 

In the Save tab, change format JPEG, PNG or IFF DEEP. Tick incremental and base filename if necessary and then click the Save button. The image will now be saved to permanent storage.


The driver ignores a device if it is already bond to another usb class, rejects it from being usable. However, open Trident prefs, select your device and use the right mouse button to open. Select &quot;NONE&quot; to prevent poseidon from touching the device. Now save settings. It should always work now.

# change the text alignment within the textbox. I can choose left, center, or right aligned by either changing the integer in the second column from 0 (left) to 1 or 2 (center, or right). 
# The third integer in the row specifies fontcolor. For instance, 0 is black, but blue is 1 and Green3 is 13.
# The sixth integer in the bottom row specifies fontface. 0 is Times-Roman, but 16 is Helvetica (a MATLAB default).
# The seventh number is fontsize. 12 represents a 12pt fontsize. Changing the fontsize of an item really is as easy as changing that number to 20.
# The next number is the counter-clockwise angle of the text. Notice that I have changed the angle to .7854 (pi/4 rounded to four digits=45 degrees).
# twelfth number is the position according to the standard “x-axis” in Xfig units from the left. Note that 1200 Xfig units is equivalent to once inch.
# thirteenth number is the “y-position” from the top using the same unit convention as before.

* The nested text string is what you entered into the textbox.
* The “01″ present at the end of that line in the .fig file is the closing tag. For instance, a change to \100 appends a @ symbol at the end of the period of that sentence.

===Games===


==== Hurrican ====

AROS version can be compiled from hurrican svn. Compiled it on the Linux side with AROS cross compilers. 

- get Hurrican source from sourceforge

- get SDL_mixer from archives.aros-exec.org (the one in AROS contrib does not have MOD support compiled in)

- cd to &quot;Hurrican/src&quot;, adjust Makefile (TARGET=aros, make INCLUDES_OS point to AROS SDL headers and fix
  path to libSDL_mixer.a)

- type make. I compiled everything on the Linux side, so
  &quot;export PATH=$PATH:&lt;arosdir&gt;/bin/linux-i386/tools/crosstools&quot; first.

- this should create &quot;Hurrican/hurricanaros&quot;.

- copy &quot;Hurrican/&quot; over to where AROS can see it. Increase stack before launching it
  (try 1000000 - stacksnoop seems to be broken at the moment, so that's just a random
  guess). Also make sure to have enough RAM in AROS. For AROS hosted try starting
  AROS with &quot;-m 256&quot;.

- cursor keys in game may not work. Try 2/4/6/8 on numkey pad and game prefs to reconfigure.

- On AROS hosted (only place I tested) to use accelerated opengl do &quot;make workbench-libs-hostgl&quot;
  and before running the game do &quot;Loadresource sys:storage/libs/mesa.library&quot;, or copy the library
  over the one in sys:libs.

There are still some little gfx, music and other problems in the game.


====Warzone 2100 ====




Command Centre - once built - radar mini map bottom left appears 

Icons in bottom right (clockwise from top) -  production, research, build, design, intelligence (goals), 
Bar power bottom middle of screen 
Power Generator near to Command 
Oil derricks on oil field (4 per gemerator) 

Factory near to power generator 

2 Research Facility near Command (one after the other) 

Set tanks off to right and scavengers attack 


Make another 3 research to end up with 5 (right mouse click to pause) 

Design menu - shows items that can be made 
Click new design centre window and click icon on rhs - choose body on the right
Click next 2 icons and rename at strip at the top of the central window 

Search out scavengers and cars on route left and up 

If discover base - destroy tower(s) first - fences - buildings last (keep distance - not too close) 

Artifacts (grey canisters) recovered to advance research 
Destroy enemy derricks and eventually put your own on there 

Research new ability - intelligence option icon - weapon research 
Research patterns - mk2 - mk3 

Build another factory - remove any rookie machine gun cars before building new ones up to 5 

Rally point(s) - yellow numbers in circles are moveable 

At each new rally point - new factory - scuttle old machine gun units - build new ones 
Put new oil derrick and connect to factory - 

Move west to next scavenger base 

Machine guard tower finally becomes available to research 

Save point 

Further missions add more to the map - to the south and east

The most important problems at that time were the so called &quot;Little endian / Big endian&quot;. 
This is the order the data are stored in memory. 

BnP is using internal much own 4-Byte IDs, to check which kind of datas are currently processed.
Especially in all it's files the IDs are playing a important role. The IDs are stored into the file in the same order they are layed out in the memory.

In a BnP file (no matter which kind) the ID &quot;NAME&quot; (saved as its ANSI-values) is stored on a Big endian system (68k-computer) as &quot;NAME&quot;. On a Little endian - system (x86-computer) as &quot;EMAN&quot;. 

My target at that time was, to make the AROS-BnP compatible to songs, which were stored on a 68k-computer (AMIGA).

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Negative ions (F + e- ‡ F-) have larger radii because the positive charge of the nucleus has less positive pulling power (PPP) due to the presence of an extra electron in this ionic state.&quot;

How can this statement be justified? - Whilst there is a repulsion effect in each of the three P orbitals, 2 of these orbitals are already occupied in fluorine, so the attraction to all 3 second P orbitals should be identical and the attractions will be the same.  What evidence is there that the P orbitals are altered by the addition of an electron?  

According to my data book, which uses the Pauling index, the van der Waals radius for oxygen (0.150 nm) is greater than the anion radius (0.140 nm).  Other indices give a yet smaller ionic radius for O.  Comparisons with covalent radii are useless as these involve different bonding orbitals.

In any case; &quot;larger&quot; than what? Ionic radii can only be estimates as they cannot be measured independently of other ions.  The criteria for all other radii measurements (covalent, van der Waals and metallic) are all different, so comparisons are meaningless.

name=Wit-Sharpening Potion|
type=Magic (potion)|
features=Uncertain|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Wit-Sharpening Potion''''' was seen being made in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] Class in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 27|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], in the first Potions class after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

While the effects of this potion are never described, it can be assumed from the name that it is intended to increase perceptiveness or &quot;wit&quot;. We do learn that the principal ingredients are powdered scarabs, ginger root, and armadillo bile, but unlike some other potions, we do not hear this one's finished state described.

The overall purpose of this potion in the narrative seems to be marking a change in concentration in the Potions class. In the earlier part of the year, up until Christmas, Potions had been centered on antidotes. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] had found this topic particularly unnerving, as he expected [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] to poison him as part of the term-end test, to see how well Harry had made his antidotes. While the Second Task occurs nearly two months later, on 24 February, and this class occurs after that, we do not see any Potions classes during the intervening months; this is the first Potions class we have attended with Harry since Christmas.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

This book was to be created by students of the University of Canberra, who are studying the unit [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Sport_event_management Sport event management] (formally titled &quot;Sport as Entertainment&quot;). In October 2010 the students were to run a sporting event and prepare a report as a chapter for this wikibook, explaining the preparation, operation and evaluation of the event. In the week starting 1 September, a structure for the chapters will be determined.

      <comment>/* Displaying the Results */ text() was unnecessary; in return clauses, string() is the best practice</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have multiple fields that you would like to search on.  You want to allow users to optionally search on specific fields and perform a boolean &quot;AND&quot; when multiple fields are used.

For example you may have a database of people.  Each person has a first name, last name, e-mail and phone.  You want to allow users to search on any single field or multiple fields together.  If two fields are entered only records that match both fields will be returned.

== Method ==
We will use a standard HTML form with multiple input and selection fields.  We will check each incoming search request for each parameter and if the parameter is not null we will concatenate a single query with many predicates and then evaluate it using the util:eval() function.

== Example XML Data Set ==

In the following example we will use an XML file that contains list of people.  The format will be the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;people&gt;
   &lt;person&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;123&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;firstname&gt;John&lt;/firstname&gt;
      &lt;lastname&gt;Smith&lt;/lastname&gt;
      &lt;phone&gt;(123) 456-7890&lt;/phone&gt;
      &lt;email&gt;john.smith@example.com&lt;/email&gt;
      &lt;type&gt;faculty&lt;/type&gt;
   &lt;/person&gt;
   &lt;person&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;456&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;firstname&gt;Sue&lt;/firstname&gt;
      &lt;lastname&gt;Jones&lt;/lastname&gt;
      &lt;phone&gt;(123) 654-0123&lt;/phone&gt;
      &lt;email&gt;sue.jones@example.com&lt;/email&gt;
      &lt;type&gt;staff&lt;/type&gt;
   &lt;/person&gt;
&lt;/people&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Background on Predicates ==
If you have a single &quot;where clause&quot; (called a predicate) you can always this predicate to the end of an XPath expression.  For example the following FLWOR expression will return all person records in the system:

   for $person in collection('/db/apps/directory')//person
   return
      $person

You can now restrict this to only include faculty by adding a predicate:

   for $person in collection('/db/apps/directory')//person[type='faculty']
   return
      $person

You can now search for all faculty with a first name of &quot;mark&quot; buy just adding an additional predicate:

   for $person in collection('/db/apps/directory')//person[type='faculty'][firstName='mark']
   return
      $person

== Sample Search Form ==

[[image:advanced-search-form-screen-image.png]]

== Sample HTML code for advanced search form ==

The following is an HTML form section for this form.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;form method=&quot;get&quot; action=&quot;advanced-search.xq&quot;&gt;            
    &lt;label&gt;First Name: &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;firstname&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    
    &lt;label&gt;Last Name: &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;lastname&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    
    &lt;label&gt;E-Mail: &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;email&quot; size=&quot;40&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    
    &lt;label&gt;Phone: &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;phone&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    
    &lt;label&gt;Primary Type: &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;select name=&quot;type&quot;&gt;
        &lt;option value=&quot;&quot;&gt;- Select -&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;option value=&quot;staff&quot;&gt;Staff&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;option value=&quot;faculty&quot;&gt;Faculty&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;option value=&quot;student&quot;&gt;Students&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    
    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;Submit&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

When the user adds a name of &quot;John&quot; to the first name field and selects a type of &quot;staff&quot; and then the submit query button is pressed the following is an example of the URL created by this form:

   advanced-search.xq?firstname=John&amp;lastname=&amp;email=&amp;phone=&amp;type=staff&amp;Submit=Submit+Query

Note that most of the fields are null.  Only firstname and type have a value to the right of the equal sign.

== Sample Search Service ==

The search service will have the following code sections.

=== Getting the URL parameters ===
The following code fragment will get the URL parameters from the incoming URL request and assign them to XQuery variables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $firstname := lower-case(request:get-parameter('firstname', ''))
let $lastname := lower-case(request:get-parameter('lastname', ''))
let $email := lower-case(request:get-parameter('email', ''))
let $phone := lower-case(request:get-parameter('phone', ''))
let $type := lower-case(request:get-parameter('type', ''))
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that each of the incoming parameters is first converted to lowercase before any comparisons are done.

=== Building the Predicate Strings ===
We are now ready to start building our predicates.  Since many of the fields will be empty we will only construct a predicate
if the variable exists.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $firstname-predicate := if ($firstname) then concat('[lower-case(firstname)', &quot; = '&quot;, $firstname, &quot;']&quot;) else ()
let $lastname-predicate := if ($lastname) then concat('[lower-case(lastname)', &quot; = '&quot;, $lastname, &quot;']&quot;) else ()
let $email-predicate := if ($email) then concat('[lower-case(email)', &quot; = '&quot;, $email, &quot;']&quot;) else ()
let $phone-predicate := if ($phone) then concat(&quot;[contains(phone, '&quot;, $phone, &quot;')]&quot;) else ()
let $type-predicate := if ($type) then concat('[type', &quot; = '&quot;, $type, &quot;']&quot;) else ()
&lt;/source&gt;

For the firstname, lastname, and email we are comparing the incoming parameter with the lowercase string in the XML file.  With the phone number we are using the contains() function to return all records that have a string somewhere in the phone number.  The type is using an exact match since both the case of the data and keyword are known precisely.

The most challenging aspect of this program is learning how to get the order of the quotes correct.  In general I use single quotes for enclosing static strings unless that string itself must contain a single quote.  Then we use double quotes.  The most difficult part is to assemble a string such as [type = 'staff'] and to remember to put the single quotes around the word '''staff'''.  If you can figure this out the rest will be easy.

If you are having trouble you can also break the concat into multiple lines:

   concat(
      '[type',
      &quot; = '&quot;,
      $type,
      &quot;']&quot;
   )

Where each line clearly must start and end with the same type of quote.

=== Concatenating the Query ===
To create an eval string we just need to create a single long string starting with the collection and add each of the predicates.  If there was no argument the predicate strings will be null.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $eval-string := concat
   (&quot;collection('/db/apps/directory/data')//person&quot;, 
    $firstname-predicate,
    $lastname-predicate,
    $email-predicate,
    $phone-predicate,
    $type-predicate
   )
&lt;/source&gt;

The query with just a lastname and type would then look like this:

collection('/db/apps/directory/data')//person[lower-case(firstname) = 'John'][lower-case(type) = 'faculty']

Note that some advanced system will modify the order of the predicates based on the most likely to narrow the search.  Since
there are fewer records with the first name John than there are faculty it is always more efficient to put the first name before the type.  This means that fewer nodes need to be moved from hard disk into RAM and the query will execute much faster.

=== Executing the Query ===
The execution of the query is done by passing the eval string to the '''util:eval''' function.
   let $persons := util:eval($eval-string) 

=== Displaying the Results ===
We are now ready to display all of the results.  We do this by creating a FLWOR statement for each person and returning a &lt;div&gt; element for each hit.  The &lt;div&gt; elements each have single link with the lastname, firstname and type as the link content.  When the user clicks on each link an item viewer is used and the ID of the person is passed to the item viewer.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
for $person in $persons
   let $id := $person/id
   let $lastname := $person/lastname
   let $firstname := $person/firstname
   order by $lastname, $firstname
   return
      &lt;div class=&quot;hit&quot;&gt;
         &lt;a href=&quot;../views/view-item.xq?id={$id}&quot;&gt;
           {$lastname},
           {$person//firstname/string()} {' '}
           {$person/type/string()}
         &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== NGram Searching ===

in your conf.xml module make sure the following line is uncommented:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;module uri=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/ngram&quot;  class=&quot;org.exist.xquery.modules.ngram.NGramModule&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is the page on NGram elements in your collection.xconf file:

[http://exist-db.org/ngram.html NGram Configuration File]

After you edit then reindex.

You can now use any of the following functions:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Acharei Mot-  After the Death    Leviticus16:1-18:30;   Amos 9:7-15

Leviticus 16 begins, “Now Yahweh spoke to Moshe after the death of Nadab and Abihu.” The death of Nadab and Abihu happened in Leviticus 10. Leviticus 16 is the logical successor to Leviticus 10, describing how to cleanse the sanctuary from the uncleanness caused by Nadab and Abihu. They had polluted the sanctuary in two ways: their sin and their death inside the sacred area (corpses were unclean). The laws of impurities were placed between Chapters 10 and 16 to explain other causes of pollution requiring the annual day of purgation (atonement).


&lt;u&gt;The Day of Atonement&lt;/u&gt;

On that day, the High Priest immersed (in a mikvah) five times, and washed his hands and feet from the kiyyor (&quot;basin&quot;) that stood before the Sanctuary ten times: each time he changed his clothes, he was required to immerse once, and wash twice (once before removing the first set of clothes, and again after dressing in the second set).
For there were five sets of services performed by him on that day: 

1) The regular morning services, performed in the &quot;golden garments&quot; throughout the year). 

2) The special services of the day (reciting the confession over the Yom Kippur offerings, casting the lots, entering the Holy of Holies to offer the ketoret and to sprinkle the blood of the Yom Kippur offerings)--performed in the linen garments. 

3) The two rams brought as &quot;ascending offerings&quot; and the day's musaf offerings--in the golden garments. 

4) returning to the Holy of Holies to remove the pan of burning incense--in linen garments. 

5) the regular afternoon services--in the golden garments.


Priests offered bulls for their own cleansing (Lev. 4:3).  A bull was the most expensive sacrificial animal and was required to cleanse the priest to make him fit to perform the ministry to cleanse others. (Vs.11)
&quot;He shall put incense on the fire before Yahweh that the cloud of incense may cover the mercy seat&quot;
The altar of incense was usually in the outer room of the sanctuary, but on Yom Kippur (The Day of Purgation) it was brought behind the veil to the inner room, the Holy of Holies. The incense smoke was a protection from the glory of God so that the priest would not die.  (Vs.13)
In order to enter the presence of the Shekhinah (glorious presence) the High Priest needed two protections: a sacrifice for purification from uncleanness  for himself and incense to shelter him from God’s holiness.

&quot;Then he shall slaughter the goat of the purification offering&quot;   (v.15)    Usually a purification offering for the whole congregation would be a bull, as for the priest (Lev. 4:14).   The offering for a leader of the people was a male goat (Lev. 4:23), which is what God prescribes for Yom Kippur.  In this case, the male goat is for the people as a whole.  As with the bull, the blood is sprinkled 7 times in front of the ark.  The number of sprinklings suggests complete cleansing.   Thus the climax of holiness is reached in the ceremony of purification performed in the Sanctuary on the Day of Atonement.


&lt;u&gt;The Two Goats&lt;/u&gt;

“When he finishes atoning for the holy place and the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall offer the live goat. 21 “Then Aaron shall lay both of his hands on the head of the live goat,and confess over it all the iniquities of the sons of Israel and all their transgressions in regard to all their sins; and he shall lay them on the head of the goat and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who stands in readiness. 22 “The goat shall bear on itself all their iniquities to a solitary land; and he shall release the goat in the wilderness.     Leviticus16:-22

What Aaron, as the High Priest of Israel, is being instructed to do regarding the laying on of hands upon the goat designated to receive the sins of Israel and what Messiah Yeshua  did on our behalf as part of the people of Israel.    

During this ceremony two goats of equal size and appearance are taken.  One goes “toward God” and the other “away from God&quot; Aaron as High Priest has been empowered to atone for the holy place, the tent of meeting and the altar.  In order to do this he will offer one of the goats as a sacrifice.  Then he is to lay his hands upon the head of the other goat and confess the sins of the people. After doing this, the goat is to be led away into the wilderness with the sins of the nation of Israel upon its head.  

In later times the goat was taken away from the city into the wilderness, twelve miles up the mountain and shoved  over the cliff where it’s bowels burst open on the rocks, to ensure it would not return to the camp and later to Jerusalem. (see Acts 1:16-19) .   As the scapegoat was led away the people knew that now their sins were also forgotten, in fact they were ‘removed from the congregation.’ Yoma 6:8 says “a strip of crimson wool was tied to the door of the sanctuary and when the he-goat reached the wilderness the strip turned white; as it is said,  ‘Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as the snow.'&quot;

The goat becomes a sin-bearer, an idea that is repeated in Isaiah 53:6, “Yahweh has laid upon him the iniquities of us all.”    Now we see the closest thing in the Torah to the cross.  Whereas sacrifices cleansed the sanctuary and the land, the scapegoat removed sins from the people.  The rabbis said the sacrifices purged the Temple, but the scapegoat purged Israel’s sins.


&lt;u&gt;Sacrifices for Sin&lt;/u&gt;

We do not appreciate the extent of how God views our sins.   In verse 21 sin is described as iniquities and transgression.  The Hebrew word for iniquity carries the meaning of perversity, depravity, iniquity and guilt.  This implies much more than what we consider to be sin.  God takes sin to a whole other level.  While we may mouth pretty prayers about the sinners we are,  do we really understand that we are sinners.   Each and every one of us is a sinner before the face of God.   Our sin causes us not be able to stand in the presence of God or else we would die.  It is only through the intercession of the High Priest of Israel that a temporary covering was placed over Israel that cleansed them in the eyes of God.

In addition to the sin or iniquity,  Aaron also placed upon the goat the transgressions of Israel.  In Hebrew the word is ‘pesha’ and means transgression or rebellion.  While these are two different words they mean essentially the same thing because to transgress against God is to disobey His commandments and that constitutes rebellion.  Remember the first sin committed was by Adam and Eve (Chava) disobeying a direct command from God not to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. 

This was not mere disobedience but direct rebellion and transgression of a command from God.   No matter how God defines sin in the Torah or how many various sins He shows us the basic sin is transgression and rebellion against the word of God.   The New Covenant defines sin as this:   Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.  1 John 3:4


The Greek word for lawlessness is ‘anomia’ which the opposite of ‘nomos’ which means law and is the equivalent to the Hebrew word Torah.  So sin is defined by the Apostle John as transgressing the Torah.

5771‘avown(2 Ki 7:9, Ps 51:5 [7]) {aw-vone’}Meaning:perversity,depravity, iniquity, guilt or punishment of iniquity 

5588[v;peh'-shah}Meaning:rebellion, transgression (nation against nation), transgression(against God), in general, as recognized by sinner, as God deals with it, as God forgives, guilt of transgression, punishment for transgression, offering for transgression

3034hd’y&quot;yadah{yaw-daw’} Meaning:to throw, shoot, cast, to shoot (arrows), to give thanks, laud,praise, to confess, confess (the 	name of God), to confess (sin), to give thanks

The Hebrew word for confess is ‘yadah’ and carries a similar meaning and is connected to the Hebrew word ‘yarah’ and is used in connection with describing the purpose of the Torah.  The Torah becomes the arrow that is shot at its mark, us, and when it hits its mark it should convict us of our sin and cause us to desire to fix the problem.

What Yahweh is communicating in Leviticus, especially through verses like 16:16 and 15:31, is that His presence could not remain in a land of sinful men and women unless sin and impurity was constantly cleansed through the means he provided.  These included daily sacrifices, morning and evening, additional sacrifices for Shabbat and holy days, additional sacrifices and ritual washings for various circumstances, and the continual ministry of the priests.   If the land needed to be cleansed so God could remain in it, how much more will we need to be cleansed in order to appear before God.


&lt;u&gt;The Blood Atonement&lt;/u&gt;

Leviticus 17:11 is a crucial Scripture theologically regarding the blood atonement.   For believers in Yeshua the message of Messiah and him crucified addresses this issue. The importance of the blood of the Lamb in the atonement for sins as well as in overcoming sin, sickness (1 Peter 2:24) and the powers of hell (Rev. 12:11) cannot be over emphasized.  How thorough is our understanding of the power of the blood?   We should appropriate its power on a regular basis in our lives?  The power of the blood is central to the efficacy of the communion elements.  The concept of the blood of Yeshua is central to the Gospel message with 40 to 50 references to it in the Apostolic Writings.  Such terms are used as “blood of the Lamb”, “blood of Messiah”, “precious blood of Messiah”, “blood of the everlasting covenant”, “redemption through Messiah’s blood”, “blood of His cross”, “communion of the blood of Messiah”, “faith in his blood”, and “purchased with his blood.”   The reality of the blood of Messiah needs to be central in our faith walk, for it is only through the blood that we have redemption.  
In this parasha Yahweh has taught us how to have life in the Mishkan and to dwell in His presence.  He shared about clean and unclean, holy and unholy practices and what separates us physically and spiritually from Him by us becoming contaminated by the foods we eat, actions we participate in or by our thoughts and speech.   Chapter 16 is the clarification of holiness and how to go about it, which continues year after year.  This is not about salvation; it’s about Temple maintenance,  our Temple - the body. It is about how to retain His indwelling Presence in a sanctified vessel - one which is holy - a vessel unto honour.


&lt;u&gt;Prophetical Application&lt;/u&gt;

•Yom Kippur is the day when:

(a) Yahweh's judgment upon the earth will occur prior to the Second Coming of Yeshua the Messiah culminating in the battle at 	Megiddo.

(b) The beast and false prophet are thrown into the Lake of Fire

(c) Satan will be cast into the bottomless pit.

Yom Kippur is the day of completion: 

It is the time when Yahweh will have the last word on man's 6000 (rebellious and sinful) years on earth.

:Satan is judged.

:The Babylon the Great system is judged.

:The earth is cleansed and readied for Messiah to &quot;touch down&quot; upon the Mount of Olives.


Comarison of Leviticus 16 Event and the Apocalypse Event of Revelation 15-16

•Smoke and fire in the Temple of Yahweh before the Mercy Seat:  Leviticus 16:13; Revelation 15:8

•Revelation 8:3-4 Incense on the Golden Altar before the throne of Yahweh are the prayers of the Saints.

•No man could enter the Tabernacle/Temple while the High Priest made Atonement:  Leviticus 16:17

•Revelation 15:8 No one could enter the Temple until the seven last plagues were completed; i.e., there was no access to the Mercy Seat/no prayers to Yahweh/no salvation granted. Men had their chance to repent from the wicked ways up to and during the 30 days of teshuvah (the thirty days of the sixth month preceding Yom Teruah) and during the ten days of awe (Tribulation period) between Yom Teruah and Yom Kippur.

•The Mercy Seat and the ground were sprinkled seven times for cleansing.

•Leviticus 16:14 The blood of the bull is sprinkled on the Mercy Seat and on the ground seven times. The four horns of the altar represent the whole earth or the four corners of the earth north, south, east and west.

•Revelation 16 Yahweh cleanses the earth via the seven bowl judgments (called “Wrath of Yahweh”). The blood of the wicked rebels is poured out on the ground (14:20).

•Why must this happen?   -   The soul that sins shall die (Ezek. 18:4, 20) and the wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23).  Either one is held accountable for his own sin and suffers the consequences of his sin or he receives the kippur (covering) of the blood of Yeshua for the remission of sins.  There are no other avenues for sinners.  For those who reject Messiah and his sin offering they are under the penalty of death and there is no way out.

•The earth has been defiled by so much unrepentant wickedness that a great cleansing process must occur men dying for their own sins.

•This proves the truth of Yahweh’s divine justice. There is divine retribution for sin a price must eventually be paid for sin.

•The earth will be prepared or cleansed for Messiah’s arrival.

•The earth will be ready to receive Messiah and his kingdom.

•Messiah, blessed be his holiness(!), cannot set foot on a defiled earth without becoming defiled himself. This is proof that Messiah cannot set foot on this earth until after the wrath of Yahweh is poured out i.e., after Yom Kippur and at the beginning of Sukkot (Feast of Tabernacles) when Yahweh Yeshua will tabernacle with his bride, the saints, who has made herself ready by putting on robes of righteousness.

•Acts 3:18-21 “The restitution of all things” (KJV) or “Fullness of times”.  
Messiah can’t return until after the earth is cleansed and restored.


&lt;u&gt;Prophetic Concepts&lt;/u&gt;

•The Fall Harvest: This time period lasts from Yom Teruah (Feast of Trumpets) to Sukkot (Feast of Tabernacles) (lasting 15 days).   Revelation 14 speaks of two endtime “harvests” of which the fall festivals are a shadow picture:
Harvest of saints to their reward Revelation 14:4-5 (and Matt. 24:30-31) and Matthew 25:31-46 (the sheep and goats judgment pictures both groups).

•Harvest of wicked to their reward Revelation 14:15-20

•There is no mention of the Saints during the Seven Bowls Wrath of Yahweh.  They’ve already been “harvested” and are gathered into Yahweh’s “barn” for safekeeping.

•The Seventh Bowl Judgment is poured out on the Babylonian (Rev. 18:23; 19:2)  system the deceiver and corrupter of the world.

==MUIBuilder==

MUI-Builder allows you to create the complete interface of an application.  For example, all the windows of this application were created with MUI-Builder. 

Each application is made up of a hierarchy of interface objects.  As an example, the following diagram depicts a possible application. 

 Application -&gt; One or more Windows -&gt; One or More Objects (maybe in groups) 

MUI-Builder is aimed at letting you create this tree simply by using a simple user-friendly graphic interface.
We will build step by step a little GUI, whose goal will be to display a simple text when we click on some buttons. 


 MUIBuilder -&gt; MIUB generic text file -&gt; View to test GUI -&gt; Object Code -&gt; create Guide Docs 




===Simple GUI layout===

MUIBuilder 2.3 application has a Windows and a Creation Control section. 

First of all we have to create a window by click on '''New Window''' under Creation Control headings which opens Windows Attributes window which has a Creation Control TAB and Attributes TAB. 

'''Add Child''' button from the middle section. 

Select in Object Choice (ie a list of GUI objects) and click on the '''Text''' option button (it is near the bottom). 

Usually would define its parameters (you don't need to modify anything at this time) and click on '''Ok'''.
; We will in future set more options within Windows and Buttons, e.g. Labels, etc. 

Your Text object is now inserted under GROUP_ROOT as G TX_label_0. 

Now add a group via Object Choice again (make it an horizontal group by ticking Horizontal Group in Attributes TAB). 

If everything goes well, you'll see the group name just under the text object e.g. H GR_grp_0

select this group, and add three buttons (select GR_grp_0 each time and '''Add Child''' and KeyButton). 
Just define their Title(s) '1st button', '2nd button' and '3rd button' and their shortcuts '1', '2' and '3'.

;Your simple GUI is now completed ! Now we will define the notifications on these objects. 


Select the 1st button in Windows Attributes, and click on the '''Notify''' button at the bottom of the MUIBuilder window. 

In the window which appears, choose the '''Release button''' event, then choose the text object you previously created (TX_label_0), and at last the '''Put a constant value''' action. 
Add this notification simply by double-clicking on the action name, or click on the '''Add notify'''. 
MUIBuilder will ask for a string for you to enter. Enter '1st button selected'. Once added, quit the notification window.

Repeat the previous operation on the two other buttons : enter '2nd button selected' and '3rd button selected' as constant strings.



;View Button 
Once you've returned to the creation window, just press the '''Test''' button, and click on the buttons of your GUI. 



The Project menu SAVE and LOAD will respectively save to and load from a file (#?.MUIB)  the interface of the application you're creating.  Using these buttons, you can continue with a previously unfinished application, or modify an already existing application. The save file is an ascii file, so it is easy to edit it using a text editor. Please don't modify them in this way : there is a good chance that you will corrupt the file ... 




===Very simple Calculator type layout===

Repeat the start of the above example until after the text object is added. 

Click on GROUP ROOT (GR_grp_0) rather that TX_Label and click on Add Child and select Group object (the top option) 

This automatically opens a '''Group Choices''' window for new GR_grp_1. 

Tick boxes Horizontal Group, Same Size, Columns and Horizontal Spacing. Set Row/Columns Number to 5 and Spacing Horizontal to 3. Click OK 

Now click once this newly added option and click Add Child again and select Keybutton to add, repeat four more times 

Single click on GR_grp_1 and '''Copy -&gt;''' button to copy the group (with buttons) to tmp windows (right hand side) 

Single click on the top entry in the tmp window (e.g. GR_grp_1). Click on '''&lt;-Copy''' button four times to copy back 

Clicking '''Test''' (center of three buttons at the bottom), you should now have a text window spanning the whole width and 25 buttons (5x5) underneath. 




===Dual directory lister type layout===

(when viewing results it adds objects underneath rather than besides) and 




;Code Button 
When you click on the 'Code' button of the MUI-Builder main window, you start the generation of the source code. 

MUI-Builder will verify that you haven't used the same label for two different objects twice. There are two lists (side by side) in the Code TAB 
* one containing the names of all objects in you application (Objects Label list)
* one containing the names of all labels that will be generated in your source code. (Generated Labels list) 

You will be able to control very precisely the way MUI-Builder will generate the labels in your code. If you don't care about 	this option, MUI-Builder will do everything automatically for you! 



Before generating the source code, you will have to define the options in the '''Options TAB'''. 
The software actually creates generic code, which is more a description of the program than a real compilable source. 

After this generic code is created ( temporary file in 'T:' ), MUIBuilder executes one of the code-generation modules ( located in the 'modules' directory ) which uses the temporary file.  Actually most languages are available. 

*Declarations : to obtain the declarations and initializations in your source
*Environment : select it if you want to generate code for includes, event loop, procedure declaration ...
*Code : select it if you want to generate the MUI code. 
*Generate IDs : 
*Notifications : to generate notifications source code.
*Locale : to generate localize code. 


;Locale Tick Box in Options TAB

When you select the '''Locale''' box in the Code window and Options TAB, you chose to generate localized source code.  In fact, all strings and shortcuts will be replaced by a call to a 'GetString' function ( which should return a locale string from your catalog file ). 

A lot of program are able to generate this function for you (Catcomp and Flexcat for examples ). 
The name of the 'GetString' function can be chosen either in the preferences window, or in the code-generation window.
If you don't know how to use these features, please take a look at the examples included in the MUIBuilder archive. 



Note that each option may be selected independently from the others. You can also create exactly the part of the code you desire ...

Example:

You've created a window and you want to add a button in your code. Select only the 'Code' option and create it will create the button code! After inserting this text in the program, you'll need the declaration of the object button in your source.  Select 'Declaration' ... and insert the generated text directly where you want in your source ! 



;Code Button
;App Code Button 
This button enables you to generate the source code for the whole application. The generated source will depend on the options you previously choose. 



;Object Code Button
This button enables you to generate the source code of an object you previously chose in the 'Objects labels' list. This operation can really be of interest, if you want to be able to create stand-alone MUI objects : for example, you could be able to generate each window independantly, or include an object in more than one window by calling the function creating this object. 

By selecting this button, you can deactivate the code generation for the object selected in the 'Generated Labels' list.

MUI-Builder automatically knows if it has to generate the label of each object. For example it is often useless to keep a pointer variable to a MUI-Group, unless you want to dynamically add objects to this group during the execution of the program. 

'''Remove Label''' and the '''Add label''' button allow you to change MUI-Builder standard definitions on objects. 


By clicking on this button, you tell MUI-Builder to generate the label of the selected object. 



;Catalog Button

The name of the '.cd' file must be given before generating the Catalog. 

Here is a summarize of what is necessary to know about the catalog description file ( 'xxxx.cd' file )

You'll find in this file all the strings of your program in the default language.

Thanks to that file, you will be able to create automatically 	( with Catcomp or Flexcat ) : 

the translation file ( 'xxxxx.ct' file ) in which you'll find the strings in a foreign language.

the program source file corresponding to your favorite language. 

To all beginners who still don't know how to localize a program, i suggest to use the now well-known Flexcat program (by Jochen Wiedmann) which will provide you the possibiliy to generate code in most languages. 




==Objects==

MUIBuilder enables you to create every MUI objects that you would like to include in you application. These objects can be created or modified in the main creation window (after you pressed the New Window button in the main window). 

To line up some objects, you just have to include them in a multi column (vertical lining) or a multi-lines (horizontal lining)  group (most of the time multi column) 

Some objects (Slider, CheckMark, String) have a title proposed by MUIBuilder.  These titles don't exist in MUI: to give you this possibility, MUIBuilder include the object and its title in an horizontal group. So you won't be able to line up these objects, if you use this feature : just use some labels + objects without title in some multicolumn groups. 

One of the frequently asked questions is : &quot;after i added some objects in my window, the GUI is no longer resizable&quot; : only one answer to give : use Space objects and add them in your GUI ! 



===Group (groups other GUI elements)===

Groups are the basics elements to which all other objects will be placed. Every time you create an object you will have to declare it as a child of a specific group. You may specify this group by selecting it in the list gadget.

When you create a new window, it already has a group default child. This child object is the root group.  You define a window by attaching children to this root group.  Note that other groups may also be children to the root group.  You must define the attributes for each group: 

*Horizontal : The objects of the group will be placed horizontally.
*Register : The group will show only one of its children at a time.  After selecting this attribute, you must go to the 'Register' entries page to chose the names of the pages of the register.
*Same Height : The all chidlren of the group will have the same height.
*Same Width : The all children of the group will have the same width.
*Same Size : The all children of the group will have the same size.
*Virtual : The group will be virtual. 
*Columns : Format the group in columns. Enter the number of columns in the string gadget.
*Lines : Format the group in rows. Enter the number of rows in the string gadget.
*Spacing
;Horizontal : enables you to control horizontal spacing between the objects.
;Vertical : enables you to control vertical spacing between the objects. This object inherits from the Area object. 

To get children there's MUIA_Group_ChildList. Walking through list is done with NextObject().

To get parent there's MUIA_Parent.

If you don't know number of children or it's variable you would have to alloc some memory for the method struct (
sizeof(struct MUIP_Group_Sort) + sizeof(Object *) * num_children) and then call it with DoMethodA(obj, alloced_method). Then free the method struct again.

num_children = number of successful NextObject() calls on child list.




===Application (main class for all applications)===

MUIA_Application_Sleep. Nesting works, too. Blocks all input handling in the window. Including resizing (since it requires input handling.) setting it to FALSE brings things back works.

Your application is the root node of the dependency tree representing your complete graphic interface.  By clicking the 'Apply' button in the main window of MUI-Builder, you can set: 

* Base of the application i.e. the name of the AREXX server of your application
* Author the author's name
* Title the application's name
* Version the version
* Copyright the copyright text
* Description a description of your application 

Moreover, you'll find in this window other buttons at the bottom : 

;Notify The possibility to add notifications on the application. It can have only one sort of child object: the Window. 

;Menu button, that will open the menu creation window, that will enable you to create the application Menu.  This menu can't be tested from MUIBuilder, since it must be attached to an application ! And i can't create a new application in the MUIBuilder application itself !!!! 




===Window (main class for all windows)===

You all already know what a window is! But the problem is learning how to make one with MUI-Builder...

After clicking '''New Window''' button, the '''Window Attributes''' window has two TABS, one named 'Creation Control' and the other called 'Attributes'. 

;The Creation page contains 2 lists: 
* In the fist one, you build your GUI itself. The display offers a hierarchical tree. To fold or unfold a node of the tree, you just have to double-click on the little arrow at the left of the object.  Thanks to the buttons between the two lists, you can edit/copy/move the objects of your GUI. Moreover, the menus offer two items Fold and Unfold which will enable you to fold or unfold completely the whole tree.
* In the two most left columns appear two letters : H(for Help) and G(for generated) : they enable the control respectively from the node generation in the guide documenation, and for the label generation in the source code. If you double-click on one of this letter, it toggles the generation either of the AmigaGuide node, or of the label in the source. 

The goal of the right-most list is to store temporarily some objects. 


;In the 'Attributes' page, you can find :  Window label and title. The window attributes themselves : 
* AppWindow : if you want your window to be a appwindow 
* Borderless : if you don't want a border
* Depth gagdet : if you want a depth gadget
* Size gadget : if you want a size gadget
* BackDrop : to have a window in the background
* Close gadget : to put a close gadget in the window
* Dragbar : enables the window to be dragged 	
* Open at Init : (IMPORTANT) this specify if you want your window to be opened when your application will be created. 

Busy window pointer uses MUIA_Window_Sleep set it to TRUE: 




===Area (base class for all GUI elements)===

Every MUI objects that inherits from the Area object include in their GUI a register group. 

Hide : The object won't appear in the GUI, except if it is alone in the window.

Disable : the object gets a ghost pattern and doesn't respond to user input.

Input Mode : enable to turn an object to a button.

Phantom Frame : The frame will not appear. 

Frame : Defines a frame for the current object. 

Background : Defines the background you want in your object. 

Control char : the character needed to activate a given object. 

Title Frame : a title added in the top of the frame of the object

Some attributes are not provided for some object : this is not a bug ... it's a feature !!! I don't want the user to be able to do something wrong in his GUI (such as making a button with a String frame !!!!). 


====Rectangle (spacing object)====

This object is little bit complex, because it offers in fact more than only one object. It enables the creation of : 

* A rectangle area in a window
* A horizontal bar, with or without a title to separate objects in a GUI
* A vertical bar to separate objects in a GUI

You can define the height and width of these objects too.


This object inherits from the Area object. 



====Balance (balancing separator bar)====

?

====Image (image display)====

To define an image for this gadget, you must select the image that you wish to be displayed. 


Possible choices are :

Free Vertical : the image will resize vertically.

Free Horizontal : the image will resize horizontally.

Input Mode : the user will be able to select the image.

Fix Height : set the image height to a constant specified in the associated string gadget. This makes Free horizontal useless.

Fix Width : set the image width to a constant specified in the associated string gadget. This makes Free vertical useless.

As with other objects, you must specify the label. 

Two notes about the image support in this version 2.2 : 

the popasl gadget provide the ability to enter an image file (which will be displayed using datatypes)

It seems there is a problem with dynamically added images in MUI : they seem to not be displayed right. So, when you'll test your application, sometimes the image won't appear. Despite of this, the code should be correctly generated. 

This object inherits from the Area object. 



====Menubar (displays a menustrip object)====
====Bitmap (draws bitmaps)====
====Bodychunk (makes bitmap from ILBM body chunk)====

====Text (text display)====

To define a Text Gadget, you must specify :

Text_SetMax : the maximum size of the gadget will be its initial size.

Text_SetMin : the minimum size of the gadget will be its initial size.

Label : Its label in the generated source code 


The text must be written in the associated string gadget and can contain every Special character you can find in a C source code.


This object inherits from the Area object.

End 
&lt;/pre&gt;




===Gadget (base class for intuition gadgets)===

====Boopsi (interface to BOOPSI gadgets)====

?


====Prop (proportional gadget)====

Set the following options :

Horizontal : the gadget must be horizontal

Fix Width : set the width to a constant specified in the associated string gadget.

Fix Height : set the height to a constant specified in the associated string gadget.


Then you should specify : 

the number of entries

the number of the first entry

the number of visible entries

As always : don't forget the label !


This object inherits from the Area object. 



====Gauge (fuel gauge)====

To define a gauge, you must set:

its orientation ( horizontal or vertical)

if you want to set the height of the gauge to a constant value it must be specified in the associated String Gadget.  This is especially useful with horizontal gauges. 

if you want to set the width of the gauge to a constant value it must be specified in the associated String Gadget.  This is especially used with vertical gauges. 

if its value must be 'divided' (then give the associated value)

its maximum value

the info test of the gauge : this little text will be displayed inside the gauge itself.  To include in this text the current level of the gauge, just put a %ld in the info text. 

its label


This object inherits from the Area object.



====Space====

This object allows you to insert a space between two other objects so the window can be resized. It can be horizontal, vertical or vertical and horizontal. You can enter the spacing value for both the horizontal and vertical space. 



====Scale (percentage scale)====

A scale gadget must be used with a Gauge gadget to display a graduation beside it.

You only have to specify its orientation. Note that only the horizontal orientation is available at this time in MUI.


This object inherits from the Area object. 




====Colorfield (field with changeable color)====

This simple object is designed to show a colour on screen. You just have to define :

If you want to fix its height or not

If you want to fix its width or not

the colour of the field


This object inherits from the Area object. 





====List====

To completely define a list, you must specify : 

its label

if 'double click' is enable or not

if the multiselection is enable

if the list is in input mode or not

if the vertical size must be adjusted at creation or not

if the horizontal size must be adjusted at creation or not

The part of the list you want to show to user (activate): - No special positioning - Show the first entry - Show the last entry


the type of the list - a standard list 
* a floattext list, that allows to show texts. You can enter a text in the corresponding string gadget 
* a list of volumes ( volumes + assigns )


The function hooks can be defined too, but they are not absolutely necessary to make the list usable (see MUI-Autodocs!)  
* Construction : called when you insert an object in the list
* Destruction : called when you delete an object in the list
* Compare : called when you sort the list 
* Display : called when you display an object
* Multitest : called when you perform multiselection 


The format of the list enables to define multicolumn lists (not tested directly in MUIBuilder). 

The list title.  Note that there is an other type of list called a DirList. This type of list can be created by clicking on its button in the 'Object Choice' window. This object inherits from the Area object. 


====DirList====

The Directory list shows the files and directories in the selected directory.  The possible options are :

Drawers only : shows ONLY directories

File Only : shows ONLY files

MultiSelection : enables a multiselection of the files in the list

Reject Icons : don't show the '.info' files 

Sort High-Low : reverse sorting order 

Sort Type : choice of the sort key ( Name, Date, Size ) 

Sort Dirs : Three possibilities :
* Directories appear at the head of the list
* Directories appear at the tail of the list
* Directories are mixed with file (following Sort Type option)

The directory to read

The pattern to accept

The pattern to reject

This object inherits from the Area object. 



====Temporary List====

In this list you can put objects you want to move from a group to another one, or from a window to another one. The list content won't be deleted when you delete your application, or when you load a new one. In this way, you will be able to transfer an object from an application to another one ... 



====Floattext (special list with floating text)====
====Volumelist (special list with volumes)====
====Scrmodelist (special list with screen modes)====


====String====

To completely define a string gadget, you must specify : 

its title ( that you can replace with your own ) 

its label

the initial content of the string gadget 

a string containing all the letters accepted by the gadget

a string containing all the letters refused by the gadget

the maximal length of the string


This object inherits from the Area object. 



====Button====

To completely define a button, you must specify: 

its label

the text that will appear in it


This object inherits from the Area object. 



====Label====

To completely define a label gadget, you must specify : 

its label

the text that appears on screen


This object inherits from the Area object. 



====Cycle Gadget====

To completely define a cycle gadget, you must specify : 

the list of its entries

its label


If you specify a control char for a cycle gadget, please add a label with the same control char, so that the user could see which character he has to use ! 

This object inherits from the Area object. 



====Radio Buttons====

To completely define a radio gadget, you must specify :

the buttons' list : to add, delete, rename the entries of this list, just use the buttons at the right of the list. 

its label


This object inherits from the Area object. 

it other amigaoses mui gives nice two rows ( MUIA_Group_Columns, 3, in my code )
&lt;pre&gt;
MUIA_Group_Child, data-&gt;settings[RESOLUTION_RADIO] = NewObject(MyRadioClass-&gt;mcc_Class, NULL,
MUIA_Radio_Entries, Radio_DPI,
MUIA_Group_Columns, 3,
MUIA_Radio_Active, 2,
TAG_END),
&lt;/pre&gt;
but on Aros i have one row :/

I added MUIA_ShowSelState, FALSE, into this code because on morphos backdrop was selected and change state. It may be ZUNE bug too and maybe should be fixed in ZUNE sources :).

&lt;pre&gt;
IPTR muiscanMyRadio_New(struct IClass *cl, Object *obj, struct opSet *msg)

for (i = 0; i &lt; entries_num; i++)
{
state = (entries_active == i) ? TRUE : FALSE;

buttons[i] = HGroup,
MUIA_ShowSelState, FALSE,
Child, (IPTR)ImageObject,
&lt;/pre&gt;

Try adding another invisible object (Child, HVSpace) to the group so that the number of objects in the group is evenly dividable by the number of rows. MUI autodocs say that is how it is supposed to be done, but maybe newer versions of it don't mind anymore.


====Register (handles page groups with titles)====
====Penadjust (group to adjust a pen)====
====Virtgroup (handles virtual groups)====
====Scrollgroup (virtual groups with scrollbars)====
====Scrollbar (traditional scrollbar)====
====Listview (listview)====



====CheckMark====

You can specify wether you want a Title or not (like the strings and sliders) before the CheckMark.  If you want a title, you can specify it in the 'title' string gadget Don't forget to specify a label. 


This object inherits from the Area object. 




===Numeric (base class for slider gadgets)===

====Knob (turning knob)====

====Levelmeter (level display)====

====Numericbutton (space saving popup slider)====

====Slider (traditional slider)====

You can specify:

if the current level must be displayed ( 'Slider Quiet' )

if the slider must be displayed in the reverse mode

if the slider must have a title or not

Then you must specify:

the maximum value

the minimum value

the initial value


You can also set:

the title of the object

and its label !


This object inherits from the Area object. 







===Popstring (base class for popup objects)===

====Popobject (popup anything in a separate window)====

The Popobject provides a list and an image associated with any of the MUI object you can create with MUIBuilder. This object will pop up when you'll click on the popup image. It will appear in the tree hierarchy display as any other object of the GUI, and can be edited in the usual way ... even if it is a group which contains many other objects. 

To define this object, MUIBuilder provides :

A list with the possible images

Some attributes :
* Follow : The Pop object follows the window
* Light : The Pop Object is displayed in a borderless window
* Volatile  : The object disappear when you click on the pop image


The hooks provided here are :
* Open Hook  : called at the opening of the pop window
* Close Hook : called at the close of the pop window

The label of the object


This object inherits from the Area object. 


====Poplist (popup a simple listview)====

====Popscreen (popup a list of public screens)====

====Popasl====

This object enables the inclusion of standard ASL requesters in your GUI.  The attributes you can set are: 

The image you prefer

The type of the requester which could be : 
* File requester
* Font requester
* Screen Mode requester

There are some hooks you can set:
* Start hook : called at the requester creation
* Stop hook  : called when you close the requester

the label of the requester

This object inherits from the Area object. 




====Coloradjust (several gadgets to adjust a color)====
====Palette (complete palette gadget)====
====Pendisplay (displays a pen specification)====
====Poppen (popup button to adjust a pen spec)====








===Family (handles multiple children)===

=====Menus=====

A menu can be attached to a window or the application object.  It is made of several titles, sub menus and items. When built, it is similar to a tree hierarchy, and is displayed in this way in the menu creation window. 

The only limitation is the depth of the tree which is limited to 2. (In fact : a sub menu can't have a sub menu) 

Moreover:

The titles, submenus  and items can be activated or not using the Enable checkmark 

The items have acces to some more attributes : 
* It can be Checkable
* If checkable, you can set its initial state
* You can define a shortcut for any menu item





===Notifications===

The events notifications is to my mind the best new feature provided in MUIBuilder 2.0.  It's the first time in the amiga history :-) that such a feature is included in an interface builder. 

The goal is to provide the possibility to define links between events and actions. The events come from MUI Object : you will define for a given event the action that will be performed, and on which object it will be performed. 

Once a link event-action is builded, it can be tested directly by MUIBuilder, by clicking on the Test button on the creation window. Every action which don't use the application object or/and external program variables can be tested without any problem in MUIBuilder. 

The notification window offers : 

The list of the possible events generated by the object whose name appears at the top of the window

The list of the objects on which an action can be performed. To help you to find a given object, the list entries are organized in a hierarchical order.  The window containing the object you are editing appears at first position in this list, then comes the application object, and at least all other windows in the application. 

Once you have selected a destination object, the third list contains all actions which can be performed on this object. Some of these actions need some arguments ... MUIBuilder will ask for them if needed. 

To add a notification on an object you are currently editing, you need either to double-click on an element of the actions list, or to select the '''Add Notify''' button. 

The application object collects all actions to make on your program itself (for example external variables modifications, functions call ...) 

When you validate an action, it is possible that it needs a parameter : if so the program will open a request window. The parameter can be of the following types : 

*Functions - Choice of a function name.
*Variables - Choice of a variable name.
*Constants - Give a constant.

The choice of an object to which you want to add a notification can be performed in two different ways : 

* For a window : by clicking on the Notify button of the Attributes page
* For an object: by selecting the given object in the creation window and clicking on the Notify button.



===Functions===

If an action parameter is a function Hook, MUIBuilder ask you for the function name. It opens a window where all the existing functions appear.  You can either chose one of the existing functions or create a new one.  When you generate the source code, MUIBuilder will generate what is needed to reference these functions. 



===Variables===

Some actions need a variable as parameter. To get this variable name, MUIBuilder opens a window, in which you can find the list of existing variables. You can either chose one of the existing function or create a new one. 



===Constants===

A constant can have several types:

* A boolean : 2 possibles values True/False
* A string
* An integer
* A character

Depending on the type of the constant, one of the gadgets of the request window will be activated. You'll have to enter the needed value in this gadget. 




===MUIBuilder Preferences===

This configuration Panel offers many choices for parameters for the program. All choices will be saved in an environment variable (ENV:MUIBuider.env) which is creating when you are installing MUIB. 

There are the following choices :

1. Ghost windows : to see ONLY one window of MUIBuilder at a time. (very useful for slow computers, and for people who dislike having too many windows on the screen ! ) 

2. Icons : select it if you want an icon created with the save file 

3. Requests : select it if you want all the warning requesters 

4. Test : if you select this option, you will see the result for your work during the building you your GUI. 

5. Code : chose your generator module 

6. Editor : You must specify here the name of your favorite editor. This editor should be run in a synchronous way !  ( i.e. not as a background task ). the following editors should work without any problems : 

7. GetString : If you enter a string here, it will be the default name of the 'GetString' function which is used to localize your program. If this String is EMPTY, then MUIBuilder will create a name using the application name ( 'GetApplicationNameString' ).

8. Depth : allows you to define the minimal depth used when displaying the tree hierarchy in the creation window.

9. Character : this character is inserted in the tree display to make hierarchy more readable.

10. Label : if you set this option, the names of the objects will appear to make the hotkay visible.

11. Columns : number of columns used to display the image objects. 

12. Images Location : The directory where you can find the objects images.


Once you have selected these options, you can save them by selecting the corresponding button. When you save the preferences, it saves your working directory too (in the environment variable of course). 






===Misc===

why does Zune use such weird get() macros? e.g.

&lt;pre&gt;
#define get(obj, attr, storage)                                         \
({                                                                      \
    union {                                                             \
       IPTR  __zune_get_storage;                                        \
       typeof(*storage) __zune_val_storage;                             \
    } __tmp;                                                              \
    __tmp.__zune_val_storage = *storage;                                  \
    ULONG __zune_get_ret = GetAttr((attr), (obj), &amp;__tmp.__zune_get_storage); \
    *(storage) = __tmp.__zune_val_storage;                                \
    __zune_get_ret;                                                     \
})
&lt;/pre&gt;

Why is it not simply:

 #define get(obj,attr,store) GetAttr(attr,obj,(IPTR *)store)

??

The problem with the first macro is that it accesses the contents of the
pointer and thus code like

int x;
get(listview, MUIA_NList_Active, &amp;x);

raises tons of &quot;variable 'x' is used uninitialized in this function&quot; warnings because the macro reads from the pointer... but it shouldn't do that because it doesn't matter what's inside &quot;x&quot; when calling get(). 

I believe the reason is the strict aliasing &quot;problem&quot; with recent GCC versions. (at least that's what I remember). 
I think the idea was to have code like this

&lt;pre&gt;
   ULONG var;
   get(obj, attr, &amp;var);
&lt;/pre&gt;

working on 64 bit AROS without &quot;ULONG --&gt; IPTR&quot; source code changes. But I don't think it would work on big endian 64 bit cpus. 

It's still pretty awkward because it even breaks some code. E.g. the following doesn't work with the new get() macro: 

&lt;pre&gt;
ULONG *rgb;
get(obj, MUIA_XXX_Picture, (ULONG) &amp;rgb);
&lt;/pre&gt;
The ULONG cast causes an error here from gcc. I have to remove it in order to get it built or switch to the old macros. Very annoying...




Is there a way to make the sub-window that Network Prefs uses for entering interface details bigger? I've now added a second window like this for specifying wireless networks, and the problem is even worse because the box for entering the encryption key is tiny. I've tried and failed to specify a bigger size or add a resize gadget with MUI tags. Is this a bug in the program or in Zune? 

This happens because of the rules MUI/Zune uses to calc min/max sizes. From MUIdev.guide: 

* Vertical groups - The minimum height of a vertical group is the sum of all minimum heights of its children. The maximum height of a vertical group is the sum of all maximum heights of its children. The minimum width of a vertical group is the biggest minimum width of its children.

The maximum width of a vertical group is the smallest maximum width of its children. 

So if you have a vertical group with one ore more (horizontally) resizable objects and additionally one or more objects which has a fixed width, then the group will get a fixed maxwidth, i.e. not resizable. 

So make sure that all child objects of the vgroup are resizable horizontally:

And when you add
#define MUIMASTER_YES_INLINE_STDARG
at the beginning of your program you don't need the additional argument in MUI_Request.


IMHO It would be better to study the real behaviour of the MUI classes in question to find out what should be happening and why/how we differ - and fix Zune appropriately. 

The difference between MUI and zune is, that MUI push all redraw messages and redraw later when pop the messages all at once and avoid double redraw. AROS redraw immediate. The problem of change AROS to do the same is what should do if a redraw is push and the class is remove. The object would know about the pushed redraw and should remove it on its own deletion. 


Morphos has some details on [http://library.morphzone.org/General_Rules_and_Purpose_of_Subclassing subclassing]. 


Seems to be MUI dataspace &quot;design problem&quot;, config data is stored and loaded as a stream of bytes, original type is unknown at this point. muimaster/classes/dataspace.c and notify.c For example BetterString on the other hand stores all config data as strings. 





In zune prefs select NListTree, select Example tab, then select any other class -&gt;  crash.

That's probably still this long standing [https://mail.aros.org/mailman/private/aros-dev/2009-June/058904.html bug]. Georg made some suggestions, but I was uable to implement them. 

I have a solution for the problem. It needs a new attribute MUIA_Group_InExchange. In MUIM_Group_InitChange we check if there is a parent and if this one or one of its parents is in exchange state. If so, we do not set the exchange state flag, because recalc display will be done by one of the parents of the object. If not, we set the exchange state flag for the current object and recalc
display will happen on MUIM_Group_ExitChange. I'm absolute noob when it comes to mui coding, but usually it's good practice in OOP to handle something completely inside of one class. 

Init/Exit Change might help you.

If you change a GUI element, call on the parent group first and after your modifications call MUIM_Group_ExitChange.

You can also just force a refresh without anything between init and exit:
DoMethod(groupobj, MUIM_Group_InitChange);
DoMethod(groupobj, MUIM_Group_ExitChange);

Exactly .. Zune is designed to automatically position/size the objects. Because of this you have to tell the parent object that wou are going to alter yourself, and at the end it should also cause the other &quot;children&quot; to adjust themselves accordingly. Thats the whole purpose of having to do the initchange/exitchange stuff.

Zune will make the affected objects re-layout, and then fire the draw method to make them visibly update.

You are _never_ meant to draw outside of the draw method.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Makefile templates ==
May I suggest a section (or sub page) with complete Makefile templates for typical projects? There are examples of a small c++ project, but it should be nice with for instance VHDL projects, LaTeX projects etcetera. --Petter Källström, [[Special:Contributions/78.69.195.202|78.69.195.202]] ([[User talk:78.69.195.202|talk]]) 12:55, 12 August 2010 (UTC)
: No one complained for over 4 months, so I created the page [[Make/Examples]], with only a LaTeX Makefile example. Worth to link to from the original article? --Petter Källström, [[Special:Contributions/130.236.56.173|130.236.56.173]] ([[User talk:130.236.56.173|talk]]) 17:12, 23 December 2010 (UTC)

== Questions ==
A question (so far):
=== Looping directives ===
I have a list (e.g. a variable containing all my .o files), and I would like to generate one rule for each of them. Something like:
&lt;pre&gt;Foreach file, $(ObjFiles)
$(file).o : $(file).cpp
	$(COMP) $@
endforeach&lt;/pre&gt;
This should be possible using the $(foreach ., ., .) function, if you can accept to generate another makefile each time that you call. Is there any simpler way?
-- Petter Källström, again. [[Special:Contributions/130.236.56.173|130.236.56.173]] ([[User talk:130.236.56.173|talk]]) 16:13, 21 December 2010 (UTC)

: Yes, there's a simpler way -- &quot;implicit rules&quot;. In particular, &quot;built-in implicit rules&quot; make this super-easy.

: This particular task you mention is super-common: &quot;I have a bunch of &quot;.cpp&quot; files, and each one needs to be compiled into its respective &quot;.o&quot; intermediate files before I link them all together into the final executable (unless somehow I can automatically skip some particular compilation because I haven't changed that &quot;.cpp&quot; since the last time I made the &quot;.o&quot; file from it)&quot;.

: The particular task you mention is so super-common that there is a built-in implicit rule to recent versions of ''make'' to handle it.
: When you type &quot;make&quot; on the command line and it finds the following makefile:
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
# Create the executable &quot;file1&quot; from all the source files.
COMPILER=g++
OBJS=file1.o file2.o file3.o
default: testcase
testcase: $(OBJS)
	$(COMPILER) -o file1 $(OBJS)
&lt;/source&gt;
: then &quot;make&quot; automagically hunts around for some source file &quot;file2.c&quot; or &quot;file2.cpp&quot; or &quot;file2.p&quot; or &quot;file2.f&quot; source file it can possibly compile to create that &quot;file2.o&quot; file, then re-builds &quot;file2.o&quot; from whichever one of those files it found, using the appropriate compiler and the appropriate compiler flags.
: This may at first appear to be merely a fragment of a makefile that *only* handles one step -- it appears to *only* run &quot;g++&quot; once, converting the penultimate &quot;.o&quot; intermediate files into the final &quot;.file&quot; executable -- but this file is actually so much more.
: This is a complete makefile that handles the complete process of converting several source files (and creating a bunch of &quot;.o&quot; files as an intermediate step) into the final &quot;file1&quot; executable.
: (If you don't like the built-in defaults, the [http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Catalogue-of-Rules.html Catalogue of Rules] explains how to set the appropriate C compiler, C++ compiler, Pascal compiler, and Fortran compiler, and how to set the appropriate compiler flags for each one).
: How can we improve the [[make]] Wikibook, so when it mentions that makefile, our readers understand that it's a complete makefile that handles the complete process, rather than just a fragment of a makefile that handles one step of the process?

: The more general task you mention -- &quot;I have a long list of input source files, and I want to run some function on each one of them, as if I manually typed in a separate rule like this for each one of them -- but, alas, there is no built-in implicit rule to handle this kind of file&quot; -- can also be handled by a single implicit rule, but it's more complicated.
: Adding the following lines to your makefile would define an implicit rule to handle the files you mentioned in your example (if, hypothetically, this was not already a built-in implicit rule):
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
# Warning: untested fragment
%.o : %.cpp
	$(CXX) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $&lt; -o $@
&lt;/source&gt;
: Should we explain implicit rules in detail in this Wikibook, or is it enough to briefly mention them as an advanced topic and link to [http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Implicit-Rules.html Using Implicit Rules] ? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/DavidCary|contribs]]) 15:39, 25 October 2011 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ethical behavior is the cornerstone of the accounting profession. There have been many corporate scandals involving individuals who acted in an unethical, and often times illegal, way.

Ethics is the belief system that permits us to distinguish right from wrong. It is something that we develop over our lifetimes and serves to help us identify good and bad behavior.

Everyone has faced ethical situations in school and will face similar situations at work. We should be capable of identifying ethical concerns and analyzing our options, that is, what is the right and wrong thing to do. Making an ethical decision means we choose the best option available under the circumstances.

The ten members will consist of representatives from following categories: 1.Three “Code Contributor Representatives” Three persons who represent the developers who actively contribute source code to the OpenOffice.org code repository. They communicate concerns and proposals of individual as well as corporate code developers. Typically they should be members of the core projects of OpenOffice.org. 2.Three “Product Development Representatives”: These three representatives will be responsible for representing general will of all project members contributing to the product development that goes beyond code contribution (e. g. documentation, qa, distribution, marketing ...). 3.Two &quot;Lang Representatives&quot;: Once elected, the Lang Representatives are expected to actively coordinate and communicate the concerns and proposals of all Native Language Projects so that no individual language or regional group is alienated from the mainstream of OpenOffice.org community life. 4.One Community Contributor Representative: One person who has demonstrated active participation in the Project and advocacy of end users, but is not eligible for election for any of the other seats on the Council. This particularly refers to prominent members of OpenOffice.org's online user community. 5.One Sun Staff Member: One representative from Sun Microsystems. As the founding member and sponsor of OpenOffice.org it is vital to understand Sun's strategy and position on OpenOffice.org issues. Therefore the council will include one person appointed by Sun who can represent Sun as well as championing Council recommendations and requests to Sun. 2.Terms Of Service 1.Elections All Council Members (but the Sun Staff Member) will be elected using an open process that respects the principles of democracy and meritocracy. The detailed process for electing the members will be written in the bylaws but has to respect these basic rules: 1.Each OpenOffice.org community member is eligible for any of the council seats. 2.The call for candidates will be published at an online resource which is accessible for every community member. 3.Each community member is allowed to nominate candidates (including self-nomination). 4.Candidate are encouraged to introduce themselves. 5.Council members of the different categories will be elected by a corresponding constituency The Sun Staff Member will be appointed by Sun management. 2.Constituencies for elections Constituencies for council elections are defined as follows: 1.Code Contributor Representatives All active code contributors - people who constantly contribute code to the project under the general rules of the project, as defined by following criteria: 1.contributor is a domain developer 2.contributor has commit access to the OpenOffice.org code repository 3.contributing code with the established child workspace processes 4.contributing under the accepted term and conditions of the project (SCA, formerly known as JCA or CA). 5.contributor constantly takes over ownership of child workspaces (took ownership of at least one CWS within the last 6 months). 2.Product Development Representatives Category leads, project leads and co-leads of all OpenOffice.org projects (accepted and incubator) but not from the native-lang category or l10n project. 3.Lang Representatives Category leads, project leads and co-leads from native-lang projects, plus project lead and co-leads of l10n project. 4.Community Contributor Representative All OpenOffice.org community members 5.Sun Staff Member Sun Microsystems, Inc and its management 3.Length of Service 1.The Code Contributor, Product Development and Native Language Representatives will be re-elected every two years. These elections will be staggered so that half of each group is re-elected at twelve month intervals. Product development and Lang members are discouraged from serving successive terms. 2.The Community Contributor Representative will be re-elected every twelve months. This member may not serve sequential terms. 3.The Sun Staff Member will be replaced according to the discretion of Sun Management. 4.Deputies 1.Immediately on beginning Council service, each Council Member will appoint a Deputy. Where at all possible, this Deputy should be someone from the same category as the Council Member, and in any case must be a member of the OpenOffice.org Community. 2.Whenever a Council member is unavailable for a vote or other duties, whether such absence is planned or unplanned, their Deputy will temporarily assume the duties and full authority of the Council member at the request of any Council member. To this end, all Deputies are expected to constantly monitor Council discussion and issues. 3.If a Deputy becomes unable to participate actively in the OpenOffice.org Community for any significant period of time, that Deputy's Council member will immediately appoint a replacement Deputy. 5.Resignation and Removal 1.Council members may resign at any time that their active and regular participation in OpenOffice.org becomes difficult or impossible. If a Council member is absent from Council participation for more than three weeks without giving cause and an expected return date, that Council member will be considered to have resigned. 2.When a Council member resigns, his or her Deputy will serve in his or her place until a special election from the Council member's category can reasonably be held. 3.Council members may be removed for proven misconduct, according to established guidelines, by a Consensus vote of the other nine Council members. When this occurs, all other Council business is suspended until a new election for that Council seat is completed and the replacement Council member is installed. 5.Business of the Council: the Community Council activities will be conducted on principles of openness and democracy, tempered by pragmatic realities. 1.Online Forum for Council business 1.Regular Council business will be conducted through an online forum with an archive accessible to all OpenOffice.org registered users and members. This may be one or more mailing lists, or some kind of enhanced Web or online conference forum, or some combination of the preceding. 2.Occasionally, the Council may have to close some business to the public, in which case a confidential session may be established with a Council vote. This session will be brief in duration, and specific in its content, and will be made public when the necessity for confidentiality has passed. Examples of topics requiring confidential sessions include: 1.Sensitive strategic, legal or marketing discussions with Sun. 2.Confidential legal or marketing discussions with OEMs, sponsors, partners, and similar external entities. 3.Discussions of upcoming press releases. 4.Discussions of removal of Council or Community members for misconduct where such discussions could cause harm to the reputation of the person discussed. 3.This online forum will be hosted (preferably) at www.OpenOffice.org, or at another site owned and/or managed collectively by several Community members, depending on technology and available sponsorship. 2.Consent Voting: To avoid disenfranchising any group represented by a Council member, all Council votes will be by consent, unless specified different. 3.Council Procedures 1.Agenda: Every regular Council session (the duration of which will be set in the Council Bylaws), the Council will set an agenda of upcoming business which will be posted in a publicly accessible online location. 2.Modifications to the Agenda: Modifications to this agenda made necessary by events will be made both to the public agenda and posted to an appropriate general Community mailing list before being acted upon except for Rush Votes per below. 3.Timing of votes: whenever possible, all votes will be called at least five days but not more than ten days in advance of a final vote, in order to allow the larger Community a chance for comment. 4.Rush votes: In cases where immediate decision is required, a &quot;rush&quot; vote will be taken and enacted, which will be followed by a discussion period ending in a validation vote of this rush decision at the end of this period, on a normal schedule, which may result in the Rush vote being overturned or confirmed. 4.Delegation of Authority: 1.In order to keep OpenOffice.org running, the Council may delegate some portion of the Council's authority either to existing Projects, or to new Committees created by the Council. 2.Example of groups to whom the Council may choose to delegate authority may be: 1.The Project Leads 2.Release Committee 3.An Engineering Steering Committee 4.The Marketing Project 5.Bylaws 1.The Council will keep written bylaws, which will be publicly available through an online resource. 2.Each significant Council policy decision will be added to these bylaws, and thereafter become binding on all Council members unless removed through a specific Council vote. 3.Standing prior decisions by the Project Leads will be automatically “grandfathered in” to these Bylaws, unless such decisions conflict with the terms of this charter. 6.Changes to this Charter: Any alteration of the terms of this charter requires a consensus vote of the Council, which must then be ratified by all of the following means: 1.A two-thirds majority vote of the Leads of the Accepted Projects (except Lang) and Community Managers. 2.A two-thirds majority vote of the Leads of Native Language Projects. 3.A plebiscite on discuss@openoffice.org or its successor(s) in purpose as a general Community forum. 6.Definitions 1.Community Member: Any participant, either an individual or a company, in the OpenOffice.org Project in good standing as defined by the Community Guidelines. 2.Community Guidelines: A collection of guidelines on the criteria for Community membership and behavior of Community members as adopted by the Community Council. Until the Council is established, the published Guidelines at www.openoffice.org will be used. 3.Sun: Sun Microsystems, Inc and its management. 4.Consensus: A vote in which all eligible voters concur with the decision, and there are no opposing votes. 5.Consent: In consent decision making a &quot;not against&quot; is required. An argument must always be given, as well as an indication as to whether the objection is paramount or not. 6.Plebiscite: A public discussion to determine the general approval or disapproval of a measure according to the responses given and objections raised without a numerical vote being taken. 7.Simple Majority: Fifty-one percent (51%) or more of general or runoff votes. 8.Projects: The &quot;Accepted Projects&quot; of OpenOffice.org according to the criteria and procedures already in place for the projects. This includes Incubator as a single Project. 9.Native Language Projects: All sub-projects under the Native-Lang category, may include, in the future, project of regional focus that do not involve non-English languages. 10.Community Managers: Select full-time staff assigned to help manage the OpenOffice.org project by Sun, Collabnet, or sponsors. 11.Sponsors: Commercial companies or other organizations with a substantial commitment to providing resources for OpenOffice.org, as approved by the Council, generally not including Sun Microsystems (whose status goes far beyond sponsor). 12.Constituency: The group responsible for electing or appointing that particular representative as defined in the bylaws. 13.“Discouraged from serving successive terms:”: The same candidate will not run for a second term for the same Council seat, unless there is a genuine scarcity of willing and qualified candidates. 14.“May not serve successive terms”: Candidates who have just served one term are not eligible to run in the succeeding election. 15.Absence from Council Participation: A Council member is considered &quot;absent&quot; if they fail to vote by a regular vote deadline. 16.Council Seat: Any one of the ten Council representatives' positions. 17.Meritocracy: The principle observed in many Open Source projects, which states, &quot;The one who does the work calls the shots.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">GTK+ '''events''' are similar to '''signals''':  they are 'emitted' by specific widgets and can be handled by callback functions.  The only differences as far as the PyGTK programmer is concerned are the arguments to a callback function and its return value.  As an example, we'll use the 'button_pressed_event' emitted by the '''gtk.Button''' widget, which can be connected to a callback function the same way a signal is:

 button.connect('button_press_event', callback_func, callback_data)

where '''button''' is an instance of the '''gtk.Button''' object.  The '''callback_data''' argument, as explained in the previous chapter, is optional.  The definition of the callback function contains three arguments:  a reference to the widget that emitted the signal, the event and the callback data:

 def callback_func(widget, event, callback_data)

The value returned from this function '''must''' be a boolean value (unlike callback functions for signals).  This return value is an important message in the GTK+ event mechanism:

* '''False''' means that the event was not fully processed so GTK+ should continue doing whatever it usually does when this event occurs and the signal should propagate further.
* '''True''' means that the event ''was'' fully handled and GTK+ no longer needs to do any further processing in response to the event.

As an example, the 'delete_event' event is emitted from a '''gtk.Window''' when the user tries to close the window;  if we connect a callback function to this and the function returns False, GTK+ will go on to close the window and emit the 'destroy' signal.  If our callback function returns True, however, GTK+ ''does not'' close the window itself or emit the 'destroy' signal.  This allows us to intervene when someone tries to close a window so we have to opportunity to ask them if, for example, they want to save their work, and then either instruct GTK+ to close the window or leave it open by returning the appropriate values from our callback function.</text>

(7A) Tell what precautions must be taken for a safe swim.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
(7B) Demonstrate your ability to jump feet first into water over your head in depth, level off and swim 25 feet on the surface, stop, turn sharply, resume swimming, then return to your starting place.  	
(7C) Demonstrate water rescue methods by reaching with your arm or leg, by reaching with a suitable object, and by throwing lines and objects.  Explain why swimming rescues should not be attempted when a reaching or throwing rescue is possible, and explain why and how a rescue swimmer should avoid contact with the victim.	
First Class Rank Requirements 9a - 9c
(9A) Tell what precautions should be taken for a safe trip afloat.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
(9B) Before doing the following requirements, successfully complete the BSA swimmer test:	
Jump feet first into water over your head in depth, swim 75 yards in a strong manner using one or more of the following strokes: sidestroke, breaststroke, trudgen, or crawl; then swim 25 yards using an easy, resting backstroke.  The 100 yards must be swum continuously and include at least one sharp turn.  After completing the swim, rest by floating.  
(9C) With a helper and a practice victim, show a line rescue both as tender and as rescuer.  The practice victim should be approximately 30 feet fro shore in deep water.

Safe Swim Defense

 
Before a BSA group may engage in swimming activities of any kind, a minimum of one adult leader must complete Safe Swim Defense training, have a commitment card (No. 34243) with them, and agree to use the eight defenses in this plan. One of the best opportunities for Safe Swim Defense training is in summer camp. The eight defenses are:

1. Qualified Supervision 
All swimming activity must be supervised by a mature and conscientious adult age 21 or older who understands and knowingly accepts responsibility for the well-being and safety of youth members in his or her care, who is experienced in the water and confident of his or her ability to respond in the event of an emergency, and who is trained in and committed to compliance with the eight points of BSA Safe Swim Defense. (It is strongly recommended that all units have at least one adult or older youth member currently trained as a BSA Lifeguard to assist in the planning and conduct of all swimming activity.)

2. Physical Fitness 
Require evidence of fitness for swimming activity with a complete health history from physician, parent, or legal guardian. The adult supervisor should adjust all supervision, discipline, and protection to anticipate any potential risks associated with individual health conditions. In the event of any significant health conditions, an examination by a physician should be required by the adult supervisor.  Those with physical disabilities can enjoy and benefit from aquatics if the disabilities are known and necessary precautions are taken.

3. Safe Area 
When swimming in areas not regularly maintained and used for swimming activity, have lifeguards and swimmers systematically examine the bottom of the swimming area to determine varying depths, currents, deep holes, rocks, and stumps. Mark off the area for three groups: not more than 3 1/2 feet deep for nonswimmers; from shallow water to just over the head for beginners; deep water not over 12 feet for swimmers. A participant should not be permitted to swim in an area where he cannot readily recover and maintain his footing, or cannot maintain his position on the water, because of swimming ability or water flow. When setting up a safe swimming area in natural waters, use poles stuck in the bottom, or plastic bottles, balloons, or sticks attached to rock anchors with twine for boundary markers. Enclose nonswimmer and beginner areas with buoy lines (twine and floats) between markers. Mark the outer bounds of the swimmer's area with floats. Be sure that clear-water depth is at least 7 feet before allowing anyone to dive into the water. Diving is prohibited from any height more than 40 inches above the water surface; feet-first entry is prohibited from more than 60 inches above the water. For any entry from more than 18 inches above the water surface, clear-water depth must be 10 to 12 feet. Only surface swimming is permitted in turbid water. Swimming is not permitted in water more than 12 feet deep, in turbid water where poor visibility and depth would interfere with emergency recognition or prompt rescue, or in whitewater, unless all participants wear appropriate personal flotation devices and the supervisor determines that swimming with personal flotation equipment is safe under the circumstances.

4. Lifeguards on Duty 
Swim only where there are lifeguards on duty. For unit swims in areas where lifeguards are not provided by others, the supervisor should designate two capable swimmers as lifeguards. Station them ashore, equipped with a lifeline (a 100-foot length of 3/8-inch nylon cord). In an emergency, one carries out the line; the other feeds it out from shore, then pulls in his partner and the person being helped. In addition, if a boat is available, have two people, preferably capable swimmers, take it out?one rowing and the other equipped with a 10-foot pole or extra oar. Provide one guard for every 10 people in the water, and adjust the number and positioning of guards as needed to protect the particular area and activity.

5. Lookout 
Station a lookout on the shore where it is possible to see and hear everything in all areas. The lookout may be the adult in charge of the swim and may give the buddy signals.

6. Ability Groups 
Divide into three ability groups: Nonswimmers, beginners, and swimmers. Keep each group in its own area. Nonswimmers have not passed a swimming test. Beginners must pass this test: jump feetfirst into water over the head in depth, level off, swim 25 feet on the surface. Stop, turn sharply, resume swimming as before and return to the starting place. Swimmers must pass this test: jump feet first into water over the head in depth. Level off and swim 75 yards in a strong manner using one or more of the following strokes: sidestroke, breaststroke, trudgen, or crawl; then swim 25 yards using an easy resting backstroke. The 100 yards must be completed in one swim without stops and must include at least one sharp turn. After completing the swim, rest by floating. These classification tests should be renewed annually, preferably at the beginning of the season.

7. Buddy System 
Pair every youth with another in the same ability group. Buddies check in and out of the swimming area together. Emphasize that each buddy lifeguards his buddy. Check everyone in the water about every 10 minutes, or as needed to keep the buddies together. The adult in charge signals for a buddy check with a single blast of a whistle or ring of a bell, and call &quot;Buddies!&quot; The adult counts slowly to 10 while buddies join and raise hands and remain still and silent. Guards check all areas, count the pairs, and compare the total with the number known to be in the water. Signal two blasts or bells to resume swimming. Signal three blasts or bells for checkout.

8. Discipline 
Be sure everyone understands and agrees that swimming is allowed only with proper supervision and use of the complete Safe Swim Defense. The applicable rules should be presented and learned prior to the outing, and should be reviewed for all participants at the water's edge just before the swimming activity begins. Scouts should respect and follow all directions and rules of the adult supervisor. When people know the reason for rules and procedures they are more likely to follow them. Be strict and fair, showing no favoritism. 
SAFETY AFLOAT

 
Safety Afloat has been developed to promote boating and boating safety and to set standards for safe unit activity afloat. Before a BSA group may engage in an excursion, expedition, or trip on the water (canoe, raft, sailboat, motorboat, rowboat, floating in an inner tube, or other craft), adult leaders for such activity must complete Safety Afloat Training, No. 34159, have a commitment card, No. 34242, with them, and be dedicated to full compliance with all nine points of Safety Afloat.
1. Qualified Supervision
All activity afloat must be supervised by a mature and conscientious adult age 21 or older who understands and knowingly accepts responsibility for the well-being and safety of the children in his or her care, who is experienced and qualified in the particular watercraft skills and equipment involved in the activity, and who is committed to compliance with the nine points of BSA Safety Afloat. One such supervisor is required for each 10 people, with a minimum of two adults for any one group. At least one supervisor must be age 21 or older, and the remaining supervisors must be age 18 or older. All supervisors must complete BSA Safety Afloat and Safe Swim Defense training and rescue training for the type of watercraft to be used in the activity, and at least one must be trained in CPR. It is strongly recommended that all units have at least one adult or older youth member currently trained as a BSA Lifeguard to assist in the planning and conducting of all activity afloat.  For Cub Scouts: The ratio of adult supervisors to participants is one to five.
2. Physical Fitness
All persons must present evidence of fitness by a complete health history from a physician, parent, or legal guardian. Adjust all supervision, discipline, and protection to anticipate any risks associated with individual health conditions. In the event of any significant health conditions, a medical evaluation by a physician should be required by the adult leader.
3. Swimming Ability
A person who has not been classified as a &quot;swimmer&quot; may ride as a passenger in a rowboat or motorboat with an adult swimmer, or in a canoe, raft, or sailboat with an adult who is trained as a lifeguard or a lifesaver by a recognized agency. In all other circumstances, the person must be a swimmer to participate in an activity afloat. Swimmers must pass this test:
Jump feet first into water over your head. Swim 75 yards in a strong manner using one or more of the following strokes:sidestroke, breaststroke, trudgen, or crawl; then swim 25 yards using an easy resting backstroke. The 100 yards must be swum continuously and include at least one sharp turn. After completing the swim, rest by floating. This qualification test should be renewed annually.
4. Personal Flotation Equipment
Properly fitted U.S. Coast Guard-approved personal flotation devices (PFDs) must be worn by all persons engaged in activity on the open water (rowing, canoeing, sailing, boardsailing, motorboating, waterskiing, rafting, tubing, kayaking, and surfboarding). Type II and III PFDs are recommended.
5. Buddy System
All activity afloat necessitates using the buddy system. Not only must every individual have a buddy, but every craft should have a &quot;buddy boat&quot; when on the water.
6. Skill Proficiency
All participants in activity afloat must be trained and experienced in watercraft handling skills, safety, and emergency procedures. (a) For unit activity on white water, all participants must complete special training by a BSA Aquatics Instructor or qualified whitewater specialist. (b) Powerboat operators must be able to meet requirements for the Motorboating merit badge or equivalent. (c) Except for whitewater and powerboat operation as noted above, either a minimum of three hours' training and supervised practice or meeting requirements for &quot;basic handling tests&quot; is required for all float trips or open-water excursions using unpowered craft. (d) Motorized personal watercraft, such as the Jet Ski? and SeaDoo?, are not authorized for use in Scouting aquatics, and their use should not be permitted in or near BSA program areas.
For Cub Scouts:Canoeing, kayaking, rowing, and rafting for Cub Scouts (including Webelos Scouts) are to be limited to council/district events on flat water ponds or controlled lake areas free of powerboats and sailboats. Prior to recreational canoeing and kayaking, Cub Scouts are to be instructed in basic handling skills and safety practices.
7. Planning
Float Plan — Obtain current maps and information about the waterway to be traveled. Know exactly where the unit will &quot;put in&quot; and &quot;pull out&quot; and what course will be followed. Travel time should be estimated generously. Review the plan with others who have traveled the course recently. 
Local Rules — Determine which state and local regulations are applicable, and follow them. Get written permission to use or cross private property. 
Notification — File the float plan with parents or participants and a member of the unit committee. File the float plan with the local council office when traveling on running water. Check in with all those who should be notified when returning. 
Weather — Check the weather forecast just before setting out, and keep an alert weather eye. Bring all craft ashore when rough weather threatens. 
Contingencies — Planning must identify possible emergencies and other circumstances that could force a change of plans. Appropriate alternative plans must be developed for each.
For Cub Scouts:Cub Scout canoeing, kayaking, rowing, and rafting do not include &quot;trips&quot; or &quot;expeditions&quot; and are not to be conducted on running water (i.e., rivers or streams); therefore, some procedures are inapplicable. Suitable weather requires clear skies, no appreciable wind, and warm air and water.
8. Equipment
All equipment must be suited to the craft, to water conditions, and to the individual; must be in good repair; and must satisfy all state and federal requirements. Spare equipment or repair materials must be carried. Appropriate rescue equipment must be available for immediate use.
9. Discipline
All participants should know, understand, and respect the rules and procedures for safe unit activity afloat. The applicable rules should be presented and learned prior to the outing, and should be reviewed for all participants at the water's edge just before the activity begins. When Scouts know and understand the reasons for the rules, they will observe them. When fairly and impartially applied, rules do not interfere with the fun. Rules for safety, plus common sense and good judgment, keep the fun from being interrupted by tragedy.
Note: For cruising vessels (excluding rowboats, canoes, kayaks, and rafts, but including sailboats and powerboats greater than 20 feet long) used in adult-supervised unit activities by a chartered Venturing crew/ship specializing in watercraft operations, or used in adult-supervised program activity in connection with any high-adventure program or other activity under the direct sponsorship and control of the National Council, the standards and procedures in the Sea Scout Manual may be substituted for the Safety Afloat standards.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter covers the basic set of widgets which collect data from the user, including text boxes, radio buttons, tick (or check) boxes and spin buttons.  These widgets allow the most common types of data to be collected by your application.  You can get your application to pre-populate them with data and retrieve data by calling various methods, and you can place restrictions on what the user can input into the widgets, often removing the need for validation of data in your code.

== Footnotes ==

Why are some modules - for instance, those on Mercury, Venus and the Moon - plastered with footnotes? This is meant to be a book for young people, not academics. I suggest sources are listed in a module at the end of the book. If specific referencing is a must, I suggest something like the truncated-quote method:

=== Mercury ===

&quot;...is a terrestrial planet&quot; : [http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Mercury&amp;Display=OverviewLong 1]  [http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html 2]&lt;/br&gt;
&quot;...has visited Mercury&quot; : Zuber, Maria T., &lt;i&gt;Mercury&lt;/i&gt;, World Book Online Reference Center, 2004 (World Book, Inc.) [http://www.worldbookonline.com/wb/Article?id=ar356240 1]  [http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/mercury_worldbook.html 2]&lt;/br&gt;
etc.

:Well, I've been doing it as part of the proofreading process. I don't know if they'll make it to the print version, but it is nice to know where all the facts came from. It's helpful in convincing adults about the legitimacy of Wikijunior too. :)--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 05:31, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

Thanks for letting me know, [[User:Shanel|Shanel]]; I agree entirely. In fact, as well as staying online, I think they ought to make it to the print version - with the usual caveat that URLs tend to date sooner rather than later. In both cases, though, I strongly suggest they're moved to an appendix module, for the sake of our target audience. Since you've already spent time creating them, I volunteer to undertake this task - but only if there's some consensus for it to be done. Thanks for your work! &amp;nbsp; [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 00:28, 30 October 2005 (UTC)
----

Thank you! I like the idea of moving them to an appendix. It's less clutter, and it doesn't look as &quot;scary&quot; to kids. I'll start a vote on this talk page to see if everyone agrees.--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 23:12, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

: The footnotes were added during the process of fact-checking and verification.  It was the only way to see what facts had been checked and which had not.  At the time, we were hoping that someone would come along with a way we could switch the footnotes on and off, so that they would be in the source text, but off in the printed version, and in a &quot;completed online&quot; version.  Or else printed in an &quot;endnotes&quot; section.  Still hoping. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] ([[User talk:SV Resolution|talk]]) 17:46, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

== Any target audience trials? ==

Has anyone tried giving a module or two to someone in our target audience to see what they make of it?&lt;/br&gt;
How wide an age-range is our target audience meant to be?

I'm wondering whether a number of systematic features of the book - for instance, using descriptions such as &quot;terrestrial&quot; - might puzzle younger members of our audience unduly.

[[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 05:00, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

:There's been no testing by kids as far as I know. Wikijunior is meant for 7-12 year olds. There is a glossary, but I don't think it's complete. That, and it has to be proofread to make sure the definitions are kid-friendly too--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 05:18, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

In which case I'm also wondering just how far numbers (especially those using decimals) and units should be part of the main text, rather than only in say infoboxes or the like. I can imagine not everyone who might enjoy reading this book is as educated or confident with numbers and units as the book currently suggests (to me, at least). I'm not meaning to suggest the book should be &quot;dumbed down&quot; but rather that there's more division between words and numbers etc.

My niece is a little too young to try a test-read at present, but perhaps you or anyone else might know some 7-12 year olds only too willing to tell us what they think...?

Thanks,&lt;/br&gt;
[[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 00:38, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

: I could, thoeretically, see if my old elementary school teachers are interested seeing it and using it, prehapes for a lesson or 2, in there class. However I have some doubts that such a goal is possible cause it require vasts amounts of ink and paper to print enoug for the 30+ people. Prehapes I could simply print out the section that relates to the perticular lesson. Also I am surronded by young neighbors (like 4,6,7, 7, 8, 10, 10, 12 year old people (yeah quite a range)) so prehapes I could show it to them and tell me how they like it. [[User:N1person|N1person]] 04:11, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

This sounds a perfect opportunity, N1person, so please go for it. Yes, I'd print out only one or two modules &amp;ndash; ones that may be too simple or too sophisticated in content and/or tone &amp;ndash; and see what people made of them. Some idea of what's too simple or too sophisticated for young people these days would be great. Thanks in advance, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 13:18, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

:I don't know any young kids, and my brother and I are too old (15 and 17). I've been trying to round numbers as I proofread so there aren't any decimal places, and avoid words like &quot;silicate&quot; and &quot;organic compunds.&quot; --[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 19:55, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

[[Image:Kid Reading Wikijunior Solar System.png|thumb|right|250px|My son reading Wikijunior Solar System]]

The #1 complaint that I had (in an admittedly very politically conservative area) was the images of some of the greek gods in their various states of undress.  The raping of Europa by Zeus in particular was considered rather offensive, even this from my perspective it is classical art.  The image of Neptune was also considered borderline pornographic.  Since the images of the various Greek dieties is hardly even necessary, I am considering just removing them altogether (even though I was the one who added them in).  There is a mythology component to the planets that is useful in a historical context, but we don't need to be an art history book either.

I've also been looking at other intro to the Solar System books that are commercially published, and now that I'm working on this book here I can see so many factual errors in those other books.  One very blatant error I saw in one book was a mixup between Phobos and Deimos on the discussion of Mars.  This is one area where having many contributors and the editorial style of a Wiki can have a huge improvement over other similar projects.  Indeed the factual material was one of the areas where people were most impressed when I showed the book to them.

In terms of physical publishing, make sure that the images you use for the main content also look reasonable in Black &amp; White.  Color publishing is still incredibly expensive unless you have a huge print run, and even then it still costs more.  I've published this book with a small printing company near where I live, and the cost was somewhat reasonable as long as the bulk of the images were all in B&amp;W.  The cover I did in color though, and that turned out to be incredibly stunning.  It certainly makes a splash as cover art.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:09, 7 February 2006 (UTC)


:I have to agree that he nude images of the gods could cause problems. Personally, I like them, but I am a pretty liberal minded parent. These books, whether on paper or online, need to be acceptable to  a wide audience. My area is fairly conservative, surrounded by extremely conservative smaller towns. I am sure that those pictures, no matter how non-offensive they are to those of us with open minds, would get this book, and possibly all of Wikijunior on the schools &quot;blocked&quot; list. While banning &quot;real&quot; books is seen as draconian, many of these groups will not hesitate to ban online content at the slightest hint of an issue. I do not believe in bowing down to that sort of pressure, but by starting out with &quot;acceptable&quot; material the conservatives will start having to respect the medium more and censor less in the future.[[User:Starchildmom|Starchildmom]] 22:45, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

::Being blocked would be advertizement we couldn't buy ;).

Currently, I am the only person working on the [[Wikijunior Solar System/Comets|Comets]] module.

==Reference style==
I've noticed that the way SV and Basejumper do their references is a bit iffereent than how I did mine. Each of their references has its own number, but mine are grouped together.For example, if I found two references for the length of a day on the moon, reference #24 would be both URLs. Should I split them apart?--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 21:23, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

==References.==
===In appendix?===
[[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] has suggested that we move the references to an appendix, and has volunteered to do so. So, lets have a vote:
====Yes====
#

=====Online only.=====
#[[User:Jeandré|— Jeandré,]] 2005-11-19t20:16z. I don't think a book for kids should have it in the book itself, a link to a page online with all the references would be better.

#[[User:Starchildmom|Starchildmom]] 03:14, 1 April 2006 (UTC) The way they currently are is much too confusing for kids. The references need to be separated from the main text.

====No====
#

=====Online only.=====
#

----
Also, we should probably decide on a consistent reference style. I volunteer to do this. Should it be:

===Group references to the same fact together===
#

===Number each reference individually===
#[[User:Jeandré|— Jeandré,]] 2005-11-19t20:16z

===Some newfangled style===

==How was it discovered?==
I have also been removing the &quot;How was it discovered?&quot; sections. I removed them because anything  before Uranus was known by the ancients, so that section would end up being repetitive. Plus, it was missing in most modules. In fact, I don't think it was even one of the oroginal questions. If anyone objects let me know.--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 02:41, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

Shanel, I would leave those sections in.  I'm an elementary school media specialist (and hope to become more active here), and I know that students in the 4th grade who are assigned this topic are always asked to find out how the planet was discovered.  The fact that almost all of them were known to the ancients may seem repetitive, but it's an important fact that should be attached to each planet.--[[User:Dalelyles|Dale]] 27 November 2005

== two html versions ==

What is the difference between the two html versions? Which one should I edit?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;(this unsigned entry by [[User:Gbleem|Gbleem]] 18:43, December 22 2005 (UTC))&lt;/small&gt;

: Not knowing any better, I'd say edit the version on the website rather than extracted html documents. [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 04:16, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

::The reason why there is &quot;two version&quot; under the HTML distributions is because there is a [[Wikijunior Solar System/Beck Foundation|version written specifically for the Beck Foundation]] and another version that has the full content of this website.  The concern was that the full version would have far too much content to fit within the &quot;48 page&quot; restriction that was brandied about... and even removing the extra moons of the outer planets and Mars is still too much in this regard.  '''I was the editor/author''' who made the two versions here, and all that you find in there is a transclusion of the individual articles that are also found immediately off from the main page.  By clicking on the full HTML version, you can download the whole Wikibook at once and save it with your browser.  I've done that to create the PDF version of the Wikibook as a way to simplify the process of compiling the book.  You can still click on the &quot;edit&quot; sections in the full version as well, and either one will allow you to edit the same content in that regard.  If you click on the &quot;edit this page&quot; tab, it only allows you to edit the transclusion list.  Unless there is some new major sections (like adding some major asteroids or comets, or some additional moons of Saturn), this is not going to really need to be done.  Changes in the individual articles will be updated automatically in the full versions.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:34, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

==Main Image==

umm, you guys do realize that the image of the solar system on the main page is horribly out of scale?

:Any image that attempts to display the whole Solar System is going to be horribly out of proportion simply because the range of sizes and the distances involved are absolutely huge.  I consider this main image to be more art than any attempt to be scientifically accurate, but there is still some strong symbolism that can be attached to the order of the planets, the moons, and some of the features of the Solar System that come from that image.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:43, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

: So long as some idea of the proportions involved is given in the book, sooner rather than later &amp;ndash; and esepcially as regards the difference in distances between the inner and outer planets &amp;ndash; then I reckon there should be no problem. I'd hope most young people reading the book would realise the picture wasn't to scale if they didn't already know. [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 16:18, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

== Readability; 'Freezing' modules to form a version 1 of the book ==

I've not been copyediting or revising material for this book for a while now as it occurred to me that I'm not confident how simple or sophisticated the text could/should be. On the one hand, I feel some modules might be overloaded with information and demands on reading skills; but, on the other hand, that some modules &amp;ndash; including those at the start of the book I've worked through &amp;ndash; might now be too simple.

Does anyone reading this have experience working with the target audience (8-12 year olds) and wish to pass comment? &amp;nbsp;I &amp;ndash; and I hope others &amp;ndash; would be grateful.

Meanwhile, by &quot;taking snapshots to form a version 1.0&quot;, I'm returning to a concern expressed a month ago by [[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]], who(m?) I see has previously been much involved in this project. Please see [[User talk:David Kernow#Wikijunior Solar System/Our Solar System]]. I think something like a consensus (a vote?) to freeze modules as those for a version 1 of the book is needed otherwise there may never be a moment when a truly coherent, consistent book exists. Once a module is frozen as a particular version, people visiting the module's URL would work on what would become the next version of the module, to join the next versions of the other modules, all eventually 'frozen' to form the next overall version of the book; and so on. Please leave your thoughts here or at the thread linked above.

Thanks, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 16:45, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

:Freezing looks like a good idea, as long as we don't call early frozen modules version/edition 1. That designation should probably only be made after extensive testing with the target audience. -- [[User:Jeandré|Jeandré]], 2006-01-08[[User talk:Jeandré|t]]11:16z

Thanks for your response, Jeandré &amp;ndash; and also for your lonely votes above. It seems some lobbying nearer Wikibooks' root will be needed, especially re audience testing.

==FactCheck for Neptune heavily required==
Hi folks,

Im translating this project into german at german wikibooks, i have a question. You are saying that &quot;Scooter&quot; runs around the neptun every 16 hours, and you or someone else conclude this must be about 2000 Kilometers per hour. But there is something else. Neptune's day is 16 hours long, and if a full rotation is made, scooter is again visible. But Scooter needs not to move. So the question is, where does the information about 2000 Km/h windspeed come from ? -- [[User:84.189.239.208|84.189.239.208]] 01:06, 15 January 2006 (UTC) (aka [[de:Benutzer:ThePacker]])

: I researched a bit the NASA says something very different, you can compare it, if you follow this link : http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/neptunefact.html  
: I can calculate on this factsheet a maximum windspeed of 720 km/h or 200 m/s. This is far away from 2000 km/h. -- [[User:ThePacker|ThePacker]] 01:46, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

::I proofread it. It says &quot;up to 2000 Km/h.&quot; So it isn't the average wind speed, but the fastest wind speed recorded. Your calculation for the average is correct though. :)--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 19:47, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

:::Indeed, but where does this information come from. I had a look in different wikipedias and the german Brockhaus, but i havent found some hints for these high windspeeds. Those links provided do only cover tornados and their impact on facilities. But there is no link given, where something is said about maximum windspeeds of 2000km/h or 600m/s. I'm still not convinced... But i believe you proofread this article. Can you please provide me a link for this number/value? -- [[User:ThePacker|ThePacker]] 22:56, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

::::There are links though. In the references section, they're next to the fifth arrow, The links are: http://www.nineplanets.org/neptune.html and http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/solar_system_level1/neptune.html.

:I've fixed it.--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 19:51, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

== Consistent scales ==

I've noticed a couple of things about the use of scales on these pages.
#First of all they are not always consistent. On the Sun page the first temperature is in Fahrenheit, while later it is in Celsius. Velocity can be listed in miles per hour or km per hour (or both in a few places). Kilometers has also been spelled kilometres, and ''vice versa''.
#In addition your audience may not necessarily be familiar with the metric system, so a brief introduction close to the start of the book would be good. (At least for abbreviations such as '''km''', '''kg''' and '''&amp;deg;C'''.)
Thanks! &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 21:56, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

:Since the astronomical community largely uses the metric system, even within the USA, I would suggest that we stick with metric measurements.  The only situation where I think non-metric units might be acceptable (in parenthesis) might be for surface temperatures on planets or moons.  As far as kilometers vs. kilometres, that is again American vs. European spelling conventions.  I don't have an easy solution for that issue. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:36, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

::I agree with the metric system use. The kilometers vs. kilometres spelling could be explained in a units introduction section, then the abbreviation '''km''' used thereafter. Likewise such a section could compare metric vs. old English. Thanks. &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 22:11, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

==Mistake in the 'Who discovered solar system?' section==
The first paragraph starts out, &quot;Anyone who looks up at the sky enough on clear nights can see seven bright objects. These are the Sun, our Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. &quot;

Clearly, anyone who looks up into the night sky will *not* see the Sun. And if s/he does, s/he will *not* see the other six objects, and it won't be night.

Since I'm not an editor on Wikibooks, I decided I shouldn't edit this mistake, but obviously *someone* should.

--User Firsfron (from Wikipedia)

:I don't see why not, but I agree that this section does need to be &quot;cleaned up&quot;.  It should simply read (anybody who looks up into the sky) and keep it simple, but truthful.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:50, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

== Factcheck Hyperion ==

Under: How long is a day on Hyperion? is a description, which says ''Hyperion has a chaotic orbit. It wobbles so much that its location in space is impossible to predict!'': this can lead to misunderstandings, because the orbit around saturn is like an orbit compareable to other moons, but its own rotation axis is chaotic and impossible to predict. So says the german wikipedia. -- [[User:ThePacker|ThePacker]] 22:42, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

:So it has a multi-axis rotation?  Very interesting, and yes, very chaotic.  Imagine taking a gyroscope or bicycle wheel and then turing it while it is spinning.  Over time the rotation settles down to a more ordinary single axis rotation, but this is caused usually by a collsion of two similarly sized object, where the angular momentum is kept for awhile having two or perhaps more axii that the object is rotating around.  This doesn't happen on the Earth because it would take a nearly Earth-sized object to collide with the Earth to have this occur.  We would be dead if it did happen.  This has been observed with some of the smaller asteroids, and is assumed to have been caused by a recent collision... recent in terms of the age of the Solar System, not that it necessarily happened just a few days before it was observed. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:46, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

::You are explaining a rotationaxis using a regular shape. But if you have an irregular Object, the rotation axis dont have to be there where you describe it. Saturn pulls Hyperion, some of the mass is nearer to Saturn (because of its shape, and orientation in Space) and the other is further away. Because of the gravity of saturn, you can not predict, where the axis is, because: you cant't predict how much of the mass will be nearer to the Saturn (remember the irregular shape), this leads to the following problem. The gravity is not a linear function. And each different constallation of rotation (I mean the orientation of an irregular Object in relative position to Saturn) and its rotational speed of each mass element leads to a different axis. Sorry my english is not that good to explain it better.

== Adding names of planets as page titles ==

A simple '''bolded''' page title and divider bar needs to be at the top of where the text actually starts. Kids need that signpost to clearly define where to start reading. Right now, even without the cleanup notices, it is hard for a target-age reader to determine where all the web page stuff ends and the &quot;good stuff&quot; starts.

I will start adding them as I go through systematically proofreading. Maybe a simple template that would create a consistently colored bar with the page title in it would also work?

== Too many scientific errors in the book! ==

I've corrected some, e.g. chapter Venus said Venus always has the same side face to the Earth, and chapter Mercury also said 100 kg item weigh 38 kg on Mercury, also chapter Moon said the Apollo photo of the Earth was taken from the surface, I believe there still many other errors in the book, please review this carefully! — [[User:218.68.245.98|218.68.245.98]] 15:08, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

== Redoing the references ==

A quite revolution has occured on Wikimedia projects regarding citations and references.  We can now put in citations that are directly embedded into the text while we edit, and they are automatically generated and put onto the web page where we would like to put them (usually at the bottom of the page, as usual).  The really cool thing about using this approach is that each page can keep the references and citations while as a web page, but they can be either eliminated completely for the published edition or left as a huge appendix of just citiations (endnotes) when doing the printed version.  And put in very small print or have other editorial control that keeps the citations from being overwhelming to younger children.

For details on how to do this, see:  [[w:Wikipedia:Footnotes]] which goes into depth about this current footnote system.  It really does work out quite well, and I've started using it already on [[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System]], although this whole project needs massive cleanup of the citations if this is the route we want to go.  The only drawback is that it is harder to seperate citations into seperate chapters, but there may even be a cool way to do that as well.  We are going to have to do some experimentation on that level.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:23, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
:I don't see references as a big consideration for Wikijunior.  This isn't a reference work, it's an educational book for kids. [[User:Isomorphic|Isomorphic]] 22:52, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

== Editorial Standards ==

The main page says: ''&quot;It's more important to be understood than to be precisely accurate on every detail.&quot;'' and while this is probably good advice when writing for children, it might leave one with the impression that being accurate is not important. I think that this should be rephrased. Perhaps ''&quot;Being understood is just as important as being accurate. Authors should concentrate on the most important concepts rather than getting wrapped up in every trivial detail.&quot;''--[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 20:38, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

== Proofing status ==

I'm curious to know what's the status of the proofreading of this wikibook? It seems like the pages have been sitting around now for months with the proofing/do not add new material tags on them. Is one allowed to make corrections? I didn't know whether to make changes to the [[Wikijunior Solar System/Asteroid belt]] page, for example, so I just wrote them up on the talk page instead. Can anybody go in and just start doing blanket cleanup, if they are so inclined? Thanks. &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 22:00, 21 August 2006 (UTC)
: Apparently it still needs proofreading (based on the asteroids page.) ;-) When you see something that's wrong, you should go ahead and correct it. --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 05:14, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

== Dwarf Planets (Pluto is no longer a planet) == 
http://www.guardian.co.uk/space/article/0,,1857618,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=1 

Instead it is Classified as a &quot;Dwarf Planet&quot; along with Ceres and UB313. This needs to be addressed. There is now a formal definition of a planet that we shouldn't contradict anywhere.

:OK, I'm game with that.  That means that Ceres and UB313 (aka Xena) have now been promoted to planet status and this book perhaps should reflect that new definition of 11 planets instead of merely 9.  And that would be good.

:I know that is not what some people want to read here, but I consider the whole debate to be something very silly and pig-headed.  What will be very interesting it to see what will happen at the next IAU convention.  I promise you that the final word on this issue hasn't been said, and it is likly to get ugly before it gets resolved.  That the IAU has taken an official position on this issue is interesting, but there were a number of &quot;members&quot; that didn't vote on the proposal and may force this to be reconsidered.

:The thing that I find very peculiar with the &quot;definition&quot; that the IAU came up with is that in order to be considered a full-fledged planet, that planet must have substantial gravitational influence with other objects in its orbital path and that path must be nearly a circular orbit.  I consider this to be an unstable definition as exceptions will still creep in especially as other planetary systems of other stars are discovered that will challenge this definition.  In other words, I consider that to be a band-aid definition only and not something that will meet scientific rigor or help with ontological discussions about objects in space.

:For myself, I favor a mass/size definition of planets more that uses clean non-solar system centric concepts that would apply more universally even outside of our solar system.  That would include wheither a planet is circular or not due to gravity (this is required currently for even status as a &quot;dwarf planet&quot; by the IAU).  It would also be useful to include classification stages between not just planets and asteroids, but between different types of planets like terrestrial planets and gas giants.  When this distinction is fuzzy due to extra-solar planets that fall between the size of the Earth and Neptune, it will get to be very interesting.  I also don't mind calling the Earth's Moon, Titan, Triton, Ganymede, Io, Callisto, and Europa as dwarf planets either, even though the IAU is currently trying to avoid including those objects into the definition.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:51, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

It is sure that science is constantly changing. Perhaps in just a short amount of time definitions will change again, forcing everyone wanting to write something about planets to have to take a step back and start again.

There is some issue on whether or not to talk about dwarf planets at all. At this point, it seems there is mention of it in some pages, but dwarf planets don't have any pages except for, of course, Pluto. As there might be less information about each Dwarf Planet available, it is possible we may have to combine them on a single page, like comets.

The last note about dwarf planets is that UB313 has been officially named (quite recently, in fact, less than two weeks ago). Now it is called &quot;Eris&quot;, and it's moon is called Dysnomia. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 02:05, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

: The asteroids article stills says that Ceres is the largest asteroid. Since Ceres is now a dwarf planet, this is no longer true. The asteroids article needs fack checking in other ways too. --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 03:10, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

Going from one planet to the next is somewhat cumbersome (and I imagine possibly not easy for children). How about adding a 'next page' button to the bottom right of each page ? I would be prepared to do that if i get one or to: go aheads here. Regards [[w:User:Sean Heron]] [[User:211.44.18.22|211.44.18.22]] 03:52, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
:Seems like a useful idea to me. --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 05:03, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
I've done it now (and can understand why other people might not want to do it :D ) . I only noticed there where more pages in the module than in the top right box pretty late, and to say the truth couldnt be bothered with filling in all the moons of the planets into the chain of &quot;next pages&quot;. Whoever does feel like it may do so of course.

By the way, I followed the style of [[Wikijunior Big Cats/Meet The Cats| Wikijunior: Big Cats]], as that was the only other wikijunior I could find that had a next page function. Everybody feel free to improve on that of course (a page back for example ? A nice picture of a page being turned would be good as well...).

Many kind Regards [[w:User:Sean Heron]] [[User:211.44.20.113|211.44.20.113]] 14:09, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

==Prepare an audience test version/revision== 
Hey y'all, let's get a static version of this book ready for audience testing. If we can produce a pdf, I can print paper copies and get some feedback from kids and teachers at my son's elementary school. I already have both the librarian and a second-grade teacher on board. I also have some pretty good contacts at a private primary school, and through the cub scouts. I'm pretty sure I can get at least 10 kids in the target range as test readers.

What needs to be done to create a new PDF? Here are a few things I can think of. 

* Set goals for completion.
* 'Freeze' pages that have been proofed. (Replace existing cleanup tags with temporary freeze tags.)
* Decide which modules will be included. 
* Decide on a version/revision labeling convention. 
* Finish proofing included modules. (Mars, Jupiter, Asteroids all still need proofing) 
* Create the HTML master document. 
* Layout the PDF. 
* Publish the PDF. 
* Create feedback form for test readers. 
* Create feedback summary document. 
* Revise documents based on feedback.

Is anyone else ready to move this title out of limbo? How many are out there willing to commit to this? --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 18:18, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

== Stars? ==

The introduction page has a section on the stars. It mentions at the end of the paragraph that there will be more on the topic later. However, apart from a brief mention on the &quot;Our Solar System&quot; page, I don't believe stars and galaxies are even mentioned in the remainder of the book. Should that section be modified or removed? It doesn't really seem appropriate for a book on the solar system. Thanks. &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 16:42, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
: I hadn't read the intro page. It needs a lot of work, IMO. --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 19:43, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

== Format consistency ==

There are varying formats for the cool fact boxes. Also, we should change the questions in all of the pages to either including the name or saying &quot;this planet&quot; or whatever object is in question; I propose we go for filling out the name. But it's somewhat inconsistent to flip between saying &quot;this planet&quot; and the name of the planet, IMO. A single format should be chosen for consistency. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 17:04, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

: I think filling out the name is a good idea as well. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 20:07, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

== Cleanup and Proofing tags == 

I've been watching this project pretty closely for about 3 months. There have been very few edits anywhere in Wikijunior Solar System. I think the tags are actually stifling improvements to this book. If there are no objections, I'm going to take them down in two weeks. I don't think that leaving those tags up in perpetuity is beneficial in any way. If we want to tak a run at a publishable again in the near future we can figure out the best approach as a community. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 03:40, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
: Okay, I did it. 

:I'm going to think about the best way to actually get a big ready for publication in a form that we can all be proud of and propose a process on [[Talk:Wikijunior]] --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 20:05, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

The [[Wikijunior Solar System/Asteroid belt]] page appears to be in decent condition now, yet is still only shows a 50% completion status. I am wondering what else needs to be done to get that page wrapped up? &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 23:08, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

:Zero replies in two months, so I bumped the article up to 75%. &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 21:58, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

== PDF Update ==
I was wondering when (if ever) the PDF version will be updated. As of now I can not even download the PDF currently listed in the article. Is there a process by which someone will update the file? I am interested because I would be able to present the book as supplemental learning material to a fourth grade class of 23 students studying the solar system and see their reactions, but I'd only be able to do so with some copy of the book. --[[User:Odie5533|Odie5533]] 01:34, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

:I have been holding off on recreating an updated PDF file mainly because of the previous cleanup campaign and the fact that it hasn't been finished.  This is something that perhaps I will make a priority, as I have other uses for the PDF as well.
:I just saw that there is some problem with downloading the PDF files, so you might want to look at [[:Image:Solar System.pdf]] and download some of the earlier versions at the moment (which seem to work just fine for me).  I'm also going to ask on the technical side to see what might be a problem here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:34, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

== Solar System study module ==

Hi, I would like to invite all of you interested in this are, to come to en.wikiversity and cooperate on a study module called [[v:en:Solar System|The Solar System]]. Regards --[[User:Juan de Vojníkov|Juan de Vojníkov]] 17:36, 7 October 2007 (UTC)

== How long would it take people to get there ==

I'm not sure that these sections are helpful, since the time depends significantly on the propulsion method and the type of orbital path followed. I suggest that they be expanded or removed.&amp;mdash;[[User:RJHall|RJHall]] ([[User talk:RJHall|talk]]) 21:33, 16 October 2008 (UTC)

== Category sort keys ==

Until a day or so ago, the [[:Category:{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}|book category for this book]] had all the pages of the book sorted by the last name of the page; so, for example, {{nowrap|[[Wikijunior:Solar System/Jupiter/Ganymede]]}} would be listed in the category alphabetically under &lt;code&gt;G&lt;/code&gt; (for &lt;code&gt;Ganymede&lt;/code&gt;).  In some minor work on the category, I incidentally &amp;mdash; and reversibly &amp;mdash; caused this to change, so that it would now be listed in the category alphabetically under &lt;code&gt;J&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp; (for &lt;code&gt;Jupiter/Ganymede&lt;/code&gt;).  I could readily change this so it sorts by last name again, if it matters to anyone.  Does it matter to anyone?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:22, 9 July 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">As always, contributions are welcome.  We ask, however, that major changes be discussed on the book's [[Talk:PyGTK For GUI Programming|talk page]] and that the following points be observed for sake of consistency:

* Python source code should be placed between the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot; line&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags.
* The &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Navigation}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template should be placed at the bottom of each page, e.g:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Navigation|Book=PyGTK For GUI Programming|previous=Introduction|current=First Steps|next=Events}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
(Note the capital 'B' in book and lower case first letters for the other arguments - the template only works this way.)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is only my second contribution and I am unfamiliar with the process and not yet confident about making contributions. Please be gentle with me! I think there is an error on this page but I dont want to make the change without first discussing it. The section is that of Pixels.
The text says &quot;When representing text, each pixel is one character (for example, a letter, a number, a space, or a new line).&quot; My reading of this is that a character is represented by a single pixel which doesnt seem possible to me. Perhaps the original author could comment here and clarify exactly where my misunderstandings lie or redraft the section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As always, contributions are welcome.  We ask, however, that major changes be discussed on the book's [[Talk:PyGTK For GUI Programming|talk page]] and that the following points be observed for sake of consistency:

* Python source code should be placed between the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot; line&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags.
* The &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Navigation}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template should be placed at the bottom of each page, e.g:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Navigation|Book=PyGTK For GUI Programming|previous=Introduction|current=First Steps|next=Events}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
(Note the capital 'B' in book and lower case first letters for the other arguments - the template only works this way.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">As you learned in the previous chapter, signals are emitted by widgets to allow your application to respond to specific actions, for example a button press.  These responses are created by writing a function in the form:

 def callback_func(widget, callback_data=None)

and registering it with a specific widget and signal by using the widget's '''connect''' method:

 widget.connect(signal_name, callback_function, callback_data)

where '''signal_name''' is a string indicating the name of the signal to respond to, '''callback_function''' is a reference to your callback function (without brackets and arguments), and '''callback_data''' is an optional arbitrary object to pass to your callback function.

If you are structuring your application inside a Python class, as demonstrated in the previous chapter, then your callback 'method' will need an additional argument as a reference to the class instance:

 class App:
     ... snip ...
     def callback_method(&lt;strong&gt;self&lt;/strong&gt;, widget, callback_data):
        ... snip ...

For organizational purposes it is often advisable to group all your callback methods at the end of the class, or to suffix them with '''_callback'''.

== Events ==
GTK+ '''events''' are similar to '''signals''':  they are 'emitted' by specific widgets and can be handled by callback functions.  The only differences as far as the PyGTK programmer is concerned are the arguments to a callback function and its return value.  As an example, we'll use the 'button_pressed_event' emitted by the '''gtk.Button''' widget, which can be connected to a callback function the same way a signal is:

 button.connect('button_press_event', callback_func, callback_data)

where '''button''' is an instance of the '''gtk.Button''' object.  The '''callback_data''' argument, as explained in the previous chapter, is optional.  The definition of the callback function contains three arguments:  a reference to the widget that emitted the signal, the event and the callback data:

 def callback_func(widget, event, callback_data=None)

The value returned from this function '''must''' be a boolean value (unlike callback functions for signals).  This return value is an important message in the GTK+ event mechanism:

* '''False''' means that the event was not fully processed so GTK+ should continue doing whatever it usually does when this event occurs and the signal should propagate further.
* '''True''' means that the event ''was'' fully handled and GTK+ no longer needs to do any further processing in response to the event.

As an example, the 'delete_event' event is emitted from a '''gtk.Window''' when the user tries to close the window;  if we connect a callback function to this and the function returns False, GTK+ will go on to close the window and emit the 'destroy' signal.  If our callback function returns True, however, GTK+ ''does not'' close the window itself or emit the 'destroy' signal.  This allows us to intervene when someone tries to close a window so we have to opportunity to ask them if, for example, they want to save their work, and then either instruct GTK+ to close the window or leave it open by returning the appropriate values from our callback function.

== GTK+ main loop ==
The GTK+ toolkit is known as 'event-driven' because it sleeps in a loop until a signal or event is emitted, at which point it adds the signal to the end of a '''queue'''.   Another part of GTK+ takes signals from the top of the queue, one at a time, and runs whatever callback functions are registered with the signal or event before moving to the next item in the queue.  This is why you need to run the '''gtk.main()''' function, which serves to prevent your application from halting as soon as it has set up the GUI, and run any callback functions you have registered with '''.connect()''' when signals and events are emitted.

It is important to note, however, that GTK+ does not run callback functions in new threads;  if one callback function takes a long time to run, then the rest of the GUI will remain unresponsive until that function finishes.  Below is a quick example to demonstrate this point:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot; line&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python

import pygtk
pygtk.require('2.0')
import gtk
import time

class App:
    def __init__(self):
        self.window = gtk.Window(type=gtk.WINDOW_TOPLEVEL)
        self.hbox = gtk.HBox()
        self.button_print = gtk.Button(label='Print something')
        self.button_sleep = gtk.Button(label='Hang for 5 seconds')

        self.hbox.pack_start(self.button_print)
        self.hbox.pack_start(self.button_sleep)

        self.button_print.connect('clicked', self.print_hi)
        self.button_sleep.connect('clicked', self.sleep)
        self.window.connect('destroy', self.quit)
        
        self.window.add(self.hbox)
        self.window.show_all()

        gtk.main()

    def print_hi(self, widget, callback_data=None):
        print 'Hi there!'

    def sleep(self, widget, callback_data=None):
        time.sleep(5)

    def quit(self, widget, callback_data=None):
        gtk.main_quit()

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    app = App()
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:Pygtk hang example.png|right|thumb|400px]]

If you run the program above from a terminal, you should see a window with two buttons.  Pressing the first button causes 'Hi there!' to be printed on the terminal.  If you press the second button, the callback function hangs for five seconds, meaning that by pressing the second button and then the first in quick succession, the 'Hi there!' message won't be printed until 5 seconds has passed, demonstrating how signals are added to the queue which are executed one at a time.

:''&quot;In PHP5 a constructor must be declared as public or it will not work.&quot;''

The '''qvwm''' window manager resembles Microsoft Windows '95.

qvwm was written by Kenichi Kourai in 1996 and released at [http://www.qvwm.org/ qvwm.org] (later [http://www.csg.is.titech.ac.jp/~kourai/qvwm/ csg.is.titech.ac.jp/~kourai/qvwm/]). He is no longer involved, this project is run by a volunteers. Last version was released in 2007 april in [http://sourceforge.net/projects/qvwm/ sourceforge].

q means 9, and v means 5, so qv in qvwm means 95.

== Features ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Leases'''
A lease is a contractual arrangement by which a ''lessor/owner'' provides a ''lessee/user'' the right to use an asset for a specified period of time. In return, the lessee agrees to make periodic cash payments during the term of the lease. An apartment lease is a typical rental agreement referred to as an ''operating lease'' in which the fundamental rights and responsibilities of ownership are retained by the lessor. ''Capital leases''(Direct financing or sales-type leases to the lessor) are contracts that are formulated outwardly as leases, but in reality are installment purchases/sales.
Typically,
&lt;u&gt;Lessee&lt;/u&gt;:
1.Operating Lease
2.Capital 
&lt;u&gt;Lessor&lt;/u&gt;:
1.Operating Lease
2.Direct Financing Lease
or Sales-type lease
Leasing sometimes is used as a means of off-balance-sheet financing. Operational, tax, and financial market incentives often make leasing an attractive alternative to purchasing.

&lt;big&gt;Lease Classification&lt;/big&gt;
'''Capital Leases''': A lessee should classify a lease transaction as a capital lease if it includes a noncancelable lease term and one or more of the four criteria listed are met. Otherwise, it is an operating lease.
1. The agreement specifies that ownership of the asset transfers to the lessee.
2. The agreement contains a bargain purchase option.
3. The noncancelable lease term is equal to 75% or more of the expected economic life of the asset.
4. The present value of the minimum lease payments is equal to or greater than 90% of the fair value of the asset.

A '''Bargain purchase option (BPO)''' is a provision in the lease contract that gives the lessee the option of purchasing the leased property at a bargain price. This is defined as a price sufficiently lower than the expected fair value of the property that the exercise of the option appears reasonably assured at the inception of the lease.

'''Expected economic life''': If an asset is leased for most of its useful life, then most of the benefits and responsibilities of ownership are transferred to the lessee. 75% or more of the expected economic life of the asset is threshold point for this purpose.

'''Bargain renewal options''' gives the lessee the option to renew the lease at a bargain rate. That is, the rental payment is sufficiently lower than the expected fair rental of the property at the date the option becomes exercisable that exercise of the option appears reasonably assured.  

'''Minimum lease payments''': If the lease payments required by a lease contract substantially pay for a leased asset, it is logical to identify the arrangement as a lease contract substantially pay for a leased asset, it is logical to identify the arrangement as a lease equivalent to an installment purchase. It is considered to exist when the present value of the minimum lease payments is equal to or greater than 90% of the fair value of the asset at the inception of the lease.
&lt;big&gt;Additional Lessor Conditions&lt;/big&gt;
1. The collectibility of the lease payments must be reasonably predictable.
2. If any costs to the lessor have yet to be incurred, they are reasonably predictable. (Performance by the lessor is substantially complete.)

'''Operating Lease'''
If a lease does not met any of the criteria for a capital lease it is considered to be more in the nature of a rental agreement and is referred to as an ''operating lease''. In an operating lease, rent is recognized on a straight-line basis unless another systematic method more clearly reflects the benefits of the asset's use. So, if rental payments are uneven-for instance, if rent increases are scheduled-the total scheduled payments ordinarily would be expensed equally over the lease term.
&lt;u&gt;Advance Payments&lt;/u&gt;
Often lease agreements call for advance payments to be made at the inception of the lease that represent prepaid rent. For instance, it is common for a lessee to pay a bonus in return for negotiating more favorable lease terms. Such payments are recorded as prepaid rent and allocated( normally on a straight-line basis ) to rent expense/rent revenue over the lease term. Sometimes advance payments include security deposits that are refundable at the expiration of the lease or prepayments of the last period's rent. Rent payments may be scheduled to increase periodically over the lease term. The total rent over the term of the lease is allocated to individual periods on a straight-line basis. As a result, the temporarily unpaid portion of rent expense must be credited to deferred rent expense payable until later in the lease term when rent payments exceed rent expense.

On January 1, 2010, Doogin Wagon, Inc., a computer services firm, leased a printer from ElernZac Corporation. The lease agreement specifies four annual payments of $100,000 beginning January 1, 2010, the inception of the lease, and at each January 1 thereafter through 2013. The useful life of the printer is estimated to be eight years. Before deciding to lease, Doogin Wagon considered purchasing the printer for its cash price of $625,000. If funds were borrowed to buy the copier, the interest rate would have been 10%.
1. Does the agreement specify a ownership transfer?
2. Does the agreement contain a bargain purchase option?
3. Is the lease term equal to 75% or more of the expected economic life of the asset?
4. Is the present value of the minimum lease payments equal to or greater than 90% of the fair value of the printer?
5. How should this lease be classified?

'''ANSWER''':
1. Does the agreement specify a ownership transfer?
''NO''

2. Does the agreement contain a bargain purchase option?
''NO''

3. Is the lease term equal to 75% or more of the expected economic life of the asset?
''4 years &lt; 75% of 8 years''
''4 years &lt; 6 years''
''NO''

4. Is the present value of the minimum lease payments equal to or greater than 90% of the fair value of the printer?
''$100,000 x 3.48685 (Table 6, n=4, i=10%)= $348,685''
''$348,685 &lt; 90% of $625,000''=''$348,685 &lt; $562,500''

5. How should this lease be classified?
''Since none of the four classification criteria is met, this is an operating lease.''</text>

{{TODO|&amp;bull; develop text&lt;br&gt;&amp;bull; move to new page [[GLPK/Software profiling and performance optimization]]}}

__FORCETOC__

== Background ==

At the end of 2012, a [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-glpk/2012-12/msg00081.html discussion] on code development sparked on the &lt;tt&gt;[help-glpk]&lt;/tt&gt; mailing list.  The initial comments covered solver algorithms, including numerical methods, and multi-core execution.  After some deliberation, it was agreed that concurrent processing was unlikely to yield much in the way of advantage, but that that algorithmic development under serial processing had a lot to offer.  Andrew Makhorin suggested that the split was something like 20/80%.

The title of this page indicates a focus on improving the numerical methods specifically and the run-time performance more generally.  This should not preclude improvements to the solver algorithms being considered, but the emphasis is classic software performance optimization.

The issue of thread-safe execution &amp;mdash; related to multi-core execution but also different in important ways &amp;mdash; was assign its own workflow and wikibook page entitled [[GLPK/The_thread-safety_question|the thread-safety question]].  Unless circumstances dictate otherwise, this separation will be maintained.

== Purpose of this page ==

The purpose of this page (and any subsequent sub-pages) is to summarize the discussion and any consensus decisions that arise.
It is also a place where key literature can be recorded for easy reference.

Contentious issues should be debated and resolved on the &lt;tt&gt;[help-glpk]&lt;/tt&gt; list first and should not be &quot;discussed&quot; here using this page as a vehicle.

== General requirements ==

GLPK is multi-platform and solutions should also be applicable across common environments including Linux, the UNIXes, Mac OS&amp;nbsp;X, and Microsoft Windows.  These days, mobile platforms should be considered, including [[w:Android_(operating_system)|Google Android]], [[w:Ios|Mac IOS]], and [[w:Windows_Phone|Microsoft Windows Phone]].  The use of [[w:Graphics_processing_unit|graphics processing units]] has been excluded.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

==Ingredients==
* Mushroom, sliced 60g
* [[Cookbook:Butter|Butter]], 10g
* [[Cookbook:Flour|Flour]] 10 g
* Dried onion 15 g
* [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|Bay leaf]] 2 leaves
* Milk or white stock  180 ml
* Seasoning to taste
* Cream 20 ml
* Brunoise cut of mushroom for garnish
* Parsley              

==Procedure==
# Heat the butter in a heavy sauce pot or pan, add chopped onion and mushroom stir for few seconds until just transparent. Don't let the mushroom brown.
# Then add flour, stir to make roux. Don't let them brown, then pour over milk or white stock, bring to boil.
# Simmer the soup for 10 to 15 minutes until mushroom is cooked
# Pass the soup through a food mill or into a blender to purée it
# Add the purée of mushroom into the soup and add enough hot milk or cream to the soup to bring it to proper consistency but do not boil.
# Season to taste, garnish with brunoise cut of mushroom and parsley

      <text xml:space="preserve">A collage (From the French: coller, to glue) is a work of formal art, primarily in the visual arts, made from an assemblage of different forms, thus creating a new whole.
A collage may include newspaper clippings, ribbons, bits of colored or hand-made papers, portions of other artwork, photographs and found objects, glued to a piece of paper or canvas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The materials used in a collage decide much upon its outcome. 

==Materials==
Possible materials for collages are:
*Printed things, such as
**newspaper cutouts 
**postcards
**photographs
**pieces of other artworks
**printed tissue
**pieces of other artworks
**ornamental paper

*Art supplies, like
**colored paper
**hand-made paper
**papers of different grains, textures, weights

*Found/Household items, for example
**yarn
**cloth
**packaging
**tin
**CDs

*Natural items, although somewhat less typical:
**wood
**pressed leaves and flowers
**sand
**wool
**rocks

===Acquisition thereof===
Start collecting anything collage-able you like that comes into your hands. Skim mail advertisements for usable material. You can also order catalogs from home furnishers, garden stores, etc., which most companies offer for free.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== RSS Weather, News and Sports feed ==

&lt;p&gt;So you want your Leaf to tell you what the weather is like and the forecast for tomorrow?
Thanks to Dr. Bruce and Mr. Gary Malolepsy this is easy.
The RSS function also allows for news and sport news to be read and I will show you the commands in the end. (For some reason the sports function seems to be broken at the moment, I will update if/when I get it working)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just follow these instructions and you will have Leaf telling you weather and news in no time.&lt;br /&gt;
I assume you have a working copy of the Leaf AI platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, make backup copies of the following files that we will be editing:
* Leaf.lisp
* Leaf Interface.lisp
* Speech.xml
&lt;/p&gt;	

&lt;p&gt;You are going to need the RSS package from the Yahoo Leaf group at http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/leaf_an_AI_robot/files/ scroll down and you will find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Download and unzip the RSS.lisp to your Leaf folder and the IMessDLL.dll into your system folder (c:\windows\system32)
Open up your Speech.xml and add &lt;P&gt;forecast&lt;/P&gt; under the line that says &lt;P&gt;this is a dragon&lt;/P&gt;
You can now save and close the file.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;forecast&quot; is going to be our keyword for making Leaf download and tell us what the weather is like and forecast tomorrows weather.&lt;br /&gt;
Now open up RSS.lisp and copy everything with ctrl+a and then ctrl+c to copy everything into your computers clipboard, then open your Leaf Interfaces.lisp and scroll to the bottom where you will paste the clipboard into Leaf Interfaces.lisp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save and then hit compile in your File menu.&lt;br /&gt;
Close Leaf Interfaces.lisp and open Leaf.lisp, because we're now going to add the function that tells Leaf to listen for the keyword &quot;forecast&quot; and what to do when he hears it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, open up Leaf.lisp and use the find function, it's in the Edit menu.
Write &quot;this is Bart&quot; without the &quot;&quot; characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can copy and paste this section under the bart function:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 ((string-equal *text-phrase*
                (concatenate 'string robot &quot; forecast&quot;))  ;behavior
 (setf *text-phrase* nil)
 (weather YOURZIP))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Just change YOURZIP to your local zip code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To also make Leaf able to tell you news, add this code under the last one you made:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 ((string-equal *text-phrase*
                (concatenate 'string robot &quot; news&quot;))  ;behavior
 (setf *text-phrase* nil)
 (News))
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;And add &lt;P&gt;news&lt;/P&gt; to your Speech.xml under &lt;P&gt;forecast&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now compile Leaf.lisp using the File menu.&lt;br /&gt;
There you have it, Leaf can now tell you the local weather and tomorrows forecast as well as the latest news.&lt;/p&gt;

: (note) No that does not make sense, please just erase the answers to the question in the requirements for the Citizenhip in the World merit badge Wikibook think here.  It's better if it's erased so kids don't use those answers when they should be doing the work themselves.

:: It is easy for somebody assessing work (whether a child's or an adult's) to check if they have plagiarized the answer. All assessors need to do this because the information to answer any question is easily available on the Internet. In the case of your edits, it is custom and practice within this Wikibook to include the answers. While you may disagree with this, just erasing them (repeatedly) is not the way to approach it once other people have started to revert your edits. The best way is probably to start a discussion on the talk page of the book to explain why you think the answers should be removed. However, as I-20 states, the overarching princple is that we do not censor content so removing something because it might be &quot;misused&quot; is unlikely to ever succeed as an argument, but feel free to try. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:55, 15 August 2010 (UTC)
Okay I understand, thanks, but also I was trying to fix some answers up and make them better than they were originally (this was before I did the crazy erasing) and I was actually making the answers more elaborate and better.  I don't understand why they were erased, because I turned a three word sentence into a paragraph with better detail.
:It may have been reverted by mistake. The rollback tool will reverse all sequential edits by one person, so if you expanded an answer, then deleted something else (for example), the person trying to revert your removal may have accidentally removed all your changes. Anyway, I've removed your block as requested. If you're trying to improve the answers, please go ahead and do so.

Working to develop digital literacy, digital information literacy, and online networking skills with teachers instead of, or before working with students may be less productive than working with students directly. This is an interesting proposition made by [http://hedc.otago.ac.nz/magnolia/RussellButson/About-Me/Publications.html Russell Butson], working in the Higher Education Development Centre (HEDC) at Otago University. It is possible that a large proportion of the teaching staff will feel they have more to lose by participating in open education through social media. It may, therefore, be more productive to work with students who arguably have more to gain in developing digital literacy and online networking skills, given their relatively early career stages. By working directly with students it may help to benefit their learning objectives and career aspirations sooner, while helping teachers to observe more objectively the benefits and pitfalls to these new communication skills. Discussions continue with Russell Butson regarding his research into this approach to Educational Development.


Did wiki use increase between 2007 to 2009? &quot;This number was expected to increase when the teacher training schedules used by Otago Polytechnic started to include orientation and skills development in the use of wikis as well as a number of other publishing platforms and media sharing services.&quot; 

Leigh which is true - from Introduction/Otago Polytechnic's initial steps

''Otago Polytechnic is a small public education and training institution in the South of New Zealand that graduates an average of 1,987 students per year.''

The benefits of using wikis are described in two different chapters - I can see the difference - in the Introduction it is to do with content development perspectives of staff whereas in the Development chapter it is more about organisational perspective and infrastructure, so I have changed the title in the Introduction chapter to: ==Benefits for using wikis in content development==

[[Open_Education_Practices:_A_User_Guide_for_Organisations/Resources_and_Practices#Benefits_of_using_wikis|Benefits of using wikis]]

    * Open access to resources making them easily reusable on other platforms;
    * Information which is easy to edit, making development much more participatory, rather than reliant on developers;
    * Improved usability provided by a standardised interface helping to ensure a base line quality standard;
    * Version control and records of edit history which are always available;

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Introduction to Tax Accounting===

[http://www.fasb.org/summary/stsum109.shtml SAFA #109], [http://asc.fasb.org/home&amp;u=MDgtMTUtMjAxMDswNTo0MjtBQUE1MTA0OTtTVU5ZLU9zd2Vnbzs4Q0Q1NDJBQjMzQUU2QkI0RUJGMDk4QTQxQTM5NUY0QQ== 740-10-25-20]

Although most of the information on a company’s income tax return comes from the income statement, there often is a difference between pretax income and taxable income.  These differences are due to the recording requirements of GAAP for financial accounting (usually following matching principle and allowing accruals of revenue and expenses) and the requirements of the IRS’s tax regulations for tax accounting (which are more oriented to cash). Such timing differences between financial accounting and tax accounting create temporary differences.  Also there are events, usually one-time, which create &quot;permanent differences&quot;, such as GAAP recognizing as expense an item which the IRS will not allow to be deducted.

===Temporary Differences===
A temporary difference between pretax financial accounting income and taxable income often creates the amount to be included in taxable income one or two years before or after the revenue or expense was realized in financial accounting.  Recording in this matter, in turn, creates a difference of the amount that is recorded of an asset or a liability on the financial statements. Items that create temporary differences include:
    •	Installment sales
    •	Unrealized gain on recorded investments
    •	Rent collected in advance
    •	Subscriptions collected in advance
    •	Revenue collected in advance
    •	Estimated expenses and loses
    •	Unrealized loss from recorded investments at fair value
    •	Differences in recording method for depreciation
    •	Prepaid tax deductable expenses
These temporary differences create either a deferred tax liability or a deferred tax asset.

===Deferred Tax Liability===

A deferred tax liability is best described as “a liability that represents the increase in taxes payable in future years as a result of taxable temporary differences existing at the end of the current year” (Kieso, Weygandt, &amp; Warfield, 2007, p. 967).

For example: The Cram Corporation sold property worth $100 million on January 1, 2009. Terms included $25 million installments each year starting on January 1, 2009 and the final payment to be made on January 1, 2012.
 
Example of a sale creating a deferred tax liability that is a temporary difference
  ($ in millions)          Originates	     Reverses	        
  Year	                     2009     2010   2011  2012   Total
  Pretax Accounting Income    $200     $150   $125  $100   $575
  Installment sale of land   ($100)     0      0      0   ($100)
  Installment income of sale   $25      $25    $25   $25   $100
  Taxable income	      $125     $175   $150  $125   $575


In this example the pretax income vary from the taxable income for that given year due to differences in recognition of the sale of the land. Remember, according to GAAP, revenue is recognized when earned, but the IRS recognizes revenue when it is received for tax accounting.

===Deferred Tax Asset===

The opposite is true of a deferred tax asset. This is best described as a “deferred tax asset represents the increase in taxes refundable (or saved) in future years as a result of deductible temporary differences existing at the end of the current year” (Kieso, Weygandt, &amp; Warfield, 2007, p. 970).
For example: The Cram Corporation 2009 income statement included a warranty expense valued at $50 million that is deducted when paid in 2010 and 2011.

Example of a expense creating a deferred tax asset that is temporary in nature
         ($ in millions)    Originates   Reverses   
  Year	                       2009	 2010  2011   Total	
  Pretax accounting income     $200	 $150  $125    $475
  Expense on income statement   $50		        $50
  Expense on tax return	          0	 ($25) ($25)   (50)
  Taxable income 	       $250	  $125  $100   $475

In this example the expense on tax return is representative of a future tax benefit from reversing a temporary difference in warranty expense that is paid in the current year.

===Permanent Differences===
One permanent difference arises when a firm has engaged in illegal activity, and has incurred expenses that are real in GAAP terms but are disallowed by the IRS.  For example the payment of fines to the government for illegal activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Kedoshim  Leviticus 19:1- 20:27

&quot;And Yahweh spoke unto Moses, saying, Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Yisrael, and say unto them, You shall be Holy: for I Yahweh your Elohim am holy.   You shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my Sabbaths: I am Yahweh your Elohim.   Turn you not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am Yahweh your Elohim. &quot;   Leviticus 19:1-4

'Thus you are to be holy to Me, for I Yahweh am holy; and I have set you apart from the peoples to be Mine'  Leviticus :26).

The word qodesh in Hebrew is the equivalent of holy and means to 'separate' or 'a setting apart from'.    This means that when something is 'set apart' it is no longer available for general use, but separated and designated specifically for Yahweh.  Likewise, when a man marries and puts the ring on his bride's finger, he proclaims, &quot;With this act you have become sanctified to me - separated from the entire world and specifically designated only for me.&quot;

Kedoshim means holy, set aside for a special purpose, different from others.   When He demands of His people to be holy, He means that they must elevate themselves above the mundane materialistic world and conduct themselves in an exalted way which reflects His holiness.  

The overriding premise of Kedoshim begins and closes with the admonition to the children of Israel to be holy, for Yahweh is holy. In between is a list of 'dos and don'ts' that promote this requirement for the pursuit of holiness.  From simple ways to handle harvest, labor and foreign relations, to restrictions about occult and deviant sexual activity, the wide variety of instructions are all designed to set apart a sanctified people for the pleasure of Yahweh.


The parashah  deals with issues of holiness:

19:3 Parents				19:4 Idols				19:5-8 Holy meat

19:9-11 Property			19:12 Swearing				19:13-15 Oppression

19:16-18 Gossip/ Hate/Vengeance		19:19 Mixed crops/cattle		19:20-22 Relations with a slave

19:23-25 Fruit of the land		19:26 Blood/ divination			19:27-28 Hair/ tattoos/cuttings

19:29 Child concubinage			19:30 Shabbat				19:31 Spiritism

19:32 Honoring elderly			19:33-34 Protecting aliens		19:35-37 Just measures

20:1-5 Molech/ child sacrifice		20:6-8 Spiritism			20:9 Cursing parents

20:10 Adultery				20:11-12 Incest				20:13-21 Sexual sins


As one meditates upon each of these mitzvot(commandments), a sense of protection from the wickedness of the world system comes to mind.  Even though the thought of participating in many of these activities has never been considered, the sad reality is these depraved activities do occur in many civilizations.  Sadly, even in the Judeo/Christian culture of America, the laxity of moral codes and basic human ethics is fostering a proliferation of many of these formerly illegal actions.  One could readily conclude from observing the society that surrounds us that we are definitely in the Last Days that Paul warned Timothy about in his final epistle.

'But know this, that in the last days hard times will come. For men will be lovers of themselves,lovers of money, boastful, arrogant,blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful,unholy, without natural affection,irreconcilable, malicious slanderers, without self-control, brutal, haters of good, betrayers,reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; holding to a form of piety, although they have denied its power; and turn away from such men as these ' (2 Timotheos/Timothy 3:1-5).

When you take a look at this list of how men would behave in the Last Days, you can readily detect that each of these despicable end-time characteristics are almost part and parcel with men ignoring the list of commandments detailed in Kedoshim.

Rather than focus on all of the negative aspects of Kedoshim, one small section of the reading had to do with actions among the people, brethren and neighbors of Israel.  The positive commandments about how we should treat our neighbors is something that we will consider, as the distinction of our walk with the Messiah of Israel should testify that we are indeed the people of Israel.
 
When Yeshua came to us, He came as the Holy One of God. The disciples of Yeshua called Him by this title. (John 6:69) Even the demons recognized Him as the Holy One of God. (Mark 1:24)
Yeshua is called the Holy One of God because His holiness is derived directly from obeying the Father's commandments.   He said, “I do nothing on My own initiative, but I speak these things as the Father taught Me.” (John 8:28) And again he says, “I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love.” (John 15:10)  He always did the Father's will  (Luke 22:42)  He was the embodiment of the Word of God, the commandments lived out in a human being,  as He said,  “He who has seen me, has seen the Father.” (John 14:9), because the commandments are an expression of the nature and character of God.  They are a revelation of godliness (God-like-ness).
Therefore by keeping His commandments, we are conforming ourselves to His standards of behaviour and become reflections of His character and nature - His person, being holy, as He is holy.

Not that we become god-like by an external performance of the commandments given to us, but that when we do them from the heart as an act of obedience, His Word by the operation of His Spirit, sanctifies us (i.e. makes us holy), as Yeshua said, &quot;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him&quot;.   His Word is the Father's commandments which He kept.
We become holy by His indwelling presence as a result of keeping the Word of God.  John 14:15-23; 17:17


&lt;u&gt;Obeying the Commandments&lt;/u&gt;

The holiness that Yahweh sets before us, therefore, in the passage of scripture above, can only be accomplished by setting oneself apart from all that is sinful, impure, and morally imperfect.   The Torah tells us that we are to become holy in every area of our lives.  Yahweh's concern in all the instructions that He gives us is that we would not think like, worship like or live like the nations around about us.   He called His people to be to be radically different so that they were a testimony and a reflection of His own nature and character.  The essential attributes of holiness, which is the nature of God, requires putting forth a diligent effort on our part, and will require an exertion of one’s own free will to achieve, involving the denial of our own inclinations and reasonings which have been formed by those around us.   

The holiness of Yahweh is the essential attribute of His divine nature.   All moral law and perfection have its eternal origin and unchangeable basis in His own nature.   Therefore, His eternal holiness revealed to men sets before them the highest goal of their aspiration, their hope, and their endeavor to honor and live before His divine presence. 

The motivation of the instruction to be holy is centred in the fact that He is holy.   We are to be imitators of Him who called us out of darkness into His marvellous light.    We do not earn merit or greater acceptance with Him by obeying His commands to separate ourselves from all that is contrary to Him.    His love is unconditional toward us and is based on the merits of Yeshua's atonement for us alone and not by any attempt on our part to gain favour with God.   But we are able to come closer to Him when we remove the unclean things which separate us from Him.   Isaiah 59: 1-2

Our motivation should be that because He is holy and He is our Father, in love we want to respond to His goodness to us and be like Him, and bless Him with our obedience to His commands, which are for our good.
By so doing we honour His parental care of us and magnify Him in the sight of the world.

Many of the commandments were given so that the Hebrew people would be different from other nations and so that they would not look like the idol worshippers who used to shave off their sideburns and the corners of their beards or tattooing themselves, see Jeremiah 7:25-26.  Also that they would not practice their divination and sorcery.

Yeshua said,  &quot;You have heard it said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy’—  Loving your neighbor is a commandment from the parashah for this week (Lev 19:18).  Hating your enemy is not a biblical commandment.  Nor is it found in any Jewish literature.  What could Yeshua have been referring to?   Matthew 5:43-48

Hating the enemy in first century Judaism — It may very well have been that Yeshua referred to a popular saying, but one can easily see how he was referring to an attitude prevalent in first century Judaism: hatred for Rome (and for opposing religious and political parties).  One of Yeshua’s messages for his generation was to love the enemy, to turn the other cheek when insulted, and to go the extra mile when conscripted into labor. Israel was dominated by Rome for a reason — or not following God.  Yeshua taught that the way for Israel to be free from Rome was to follow God, not to start a revolution.

&quot;But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father in Heaven, because He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.   For if you love those loving you, what reward do you have.  Do not the tax-collectors do the same?  And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others?  Do not even the tax collectors do so?   Therefore you be perfect,l, just as your Heavenly Father is perfect '   (Mattityahu/Matthew 5:43-48).

This is the measure of the standard of holiness which Yeshua set for His people.    This is the perfection of the law, which is the standard of holiness found in Yeshua, the express image of the Father's Person  -  the Word made flesh. We are called to allow His Word to dwell in us in all its fullness working out in us His holiness

We love, because he first loved us.&quot;(1 John 4:19HNV revised)  Our love is in direct proportion to the amount of love we have received from the Father.  In other words, if we cultivate our relationship with Him, we will be able to receive of His love and then we will be able to love our neighbor in the same way that we are loved by our Father.

Interestingly, He concludes this admonition by reminding His listeners that they needed to be perfect or holy, just as the Father is perfect or holy.  Of course this degree of holiness or perfection can only be obtained from the imputed righteousness available by the atoning blood of the Messiah.


&lt;u&gt;The Process of Becoming Holy&lt;/u&gt;

The last two Torah parashot have focused upon the mercy seat of Yahweh and its significance, with the blood of the sacrifice sprinkled upon the mercy seat representing that forgiveness of our sins is only possible by Yahweh’ grace and His mercy, and not because of any work that we have done.   We have come to understand that our sins are blotted out through substitutionary atonement.   This is also known as regeneration and justification.  
This imparts to us a new nature which is the first requirement to becoming 'holy'.    Without this impartation of His divine nature it is impossible to achieve god-like-ness through any of our own efforts.
Justification does not make one righteous, neither does it bestow righteousness, but rather what it does, is to declare a person potentially to be justified before Yahweh.   That is, our sins are remitted or put away from us by the sacrificial atonement of Yeshua in dying for us and being cleansed by His blood.  So the sinner now becomes righteous in Yahweh’ sight when he is in Messiah Yeshua.   Once we have become justified before Yahweh, we now need to become sanctified by setting ourselves apart from that which is sinful, impure, and morally imperfect.   There is a need to change our former lifestyle by taking heed to the Word of God and following its directions for living. 

Perhaps the most oft quoted reference is described in triplicate by the gospel accounts of Matthew,Mark, and Luke. When Yeshua was asked what the greatest commandment was he responded with the following coupling.
'Yeshua answered, 'The foremost is: 'Hear,O Yisrael! Adonai is our God; Adonai is one; and you shall love Adonai your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.
'The second is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'There is no other commandment greater than these.' And the scribe said to Him, 'Very well, Teacher, You have truly stated that He is One; and that there is no one else except Him;and to love Him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength,and to love one's neighbor as himself,abounds all the more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.' And when Yeshua saw that he had answered intelligently, He said to him, 'You are not far from the Kingdom of God.' And after that, no one had the courage to ask Him any more questions'  (Mark12:29-34).

If you look at these three separate passages you will detect that the two questions had three similar but not identical answers recorded by the three different gospel writers.  Each coupled the question about what was the greatest commandment or how might one inherit eternal life with the concept of loving the Father with all one's heart, mind, soul and strength. This was considered the First Commandment and the requirement to love one's neighbor as himself was coupled as the Second. 

So when you boil it all down, and consider the referenced verses in Kedoshim, they lay the very foundation for one of the most important commandments in the Holy Writ.  Many refer to this as the 'Golden Rule' or 'doing unto others what you would have them do unto you.'  Remember after loving our Heavenly Father, we are supposed to love our neighbor as ourselves.  If you take the time to do some introspection, you might realize that obedience to the second greatest commandment is more theory than reality in your life. 

&quot;We love, because he first loved us.&quot;(1 John 4:19HNV revised)  Our love is in direct proportion to the amount of love we have received from the Father.  In other words, if we cultivate our relationship with Him, we will be able to receive of His love and then we will be able to love our neighbor in the same way that we are loved by our Father.

Interestingly, He concludes this admonition by reminding His listeners that they needed to be perfect or holy, just as the Father is perfect or holy.  Of course this degree of holiness or perfection can only be obtained from the imputed righteousness available by the atoning blood of the Messiah.


&lt;u&gt;Positional Sanctification:&lt;/u&gt;

There are three aspects of sanctification.   The first aspect is positional, which is achieved once we are justified before Yahweh.  When we make a decision to follow Yeshua, He stands before Yahweh the Holy One who judges and judicially declares righteous the sinner who believes in Him.   And the justified believer then emerges from Yahweh’ eternal court room with a consciousness that Yeshua is now his substitute, and has borne his guilt, penalty and punishment and that he/she now stands without accusation before Yahweh.  The believer has the Position of being &quot;justified&quot; - just-as-if he had never sinned.  He has been made righteous on the basis of Yeshua's atonement for him which is not based on anything that he has done other than putting his trust in that work of atonement and receiving the undeserved benefit and mercy from Yahweh.  This first step of positional sanctification, therefore, becomes the possession of everyone who comes to faith in Messiah Yeshua.  
But our 'salvation' - that which we have inherited, needs to be made our possession and incorporated into our lives.
We are exhorted to  -  &quot;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling&quot;   Philippians 2:12
As we go onwards in our pilgrim journey of being conformed to His likeness, it requires our faith in the same grace and mercy from Yahweh to appropriate the promises by faith in His son, Yeshua.  
&quot;Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see Yahweh.  &quot;   Hebrews 12:14


&lt;u&gt;Experiential Sanctification&lt;/u&gt;
Today, as well as long ago,  His people are constantly faced with the people of the surrounding nations whose amoral sexual and religious practices ran contrary to the holiness of Yahweh.   It was always Yahweh’s will that His divine presence would rest in the midst of the entire assembly of the children of Yisrael, and that they would elevate themselves to be consecrated to His calling of being a holy people.   This aspect of sanctification takes one’s lifestyle to task as it relates to becoming changed to be like Yahweh Himself.   The philosophical doctrine of men runs counterproductive to the words and instructions of life given Israel from Yahweh.   To have experientially real sanctification,  requires us to exert authority over sin by coming out of its clutches by choosing to separate ourselves from it.   This form of sanctification is actual holiness whereby we separate ourselves from all forms of idolatry, impurity of lifestyle, and immorality.   For Yahweh says that He has not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.   That means that we have to change.

We need to establish a different set of standards and life-purpose for ourselves than those in the world.    Because of that, we will often be at variance with them and unable to join in their pattern of living.   Therefore, &quot;Come out from among them and be separate says Yahweh, do not touch what is unclean, and I will receive you. I will be a Father to you, and you will be My sons and daughters, says Yahweh the Almighty'   Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the sight of God&quot;  2 Corinthians 6:17-7: 1

The world may entertain itself on a diet of impurity contrary to Yahweh’ commandments, but we refuse to sell our birthright as did Esau to gratify our fleshly desires.  The Presence of God will reside only in a holy place. The Master’s power was derived directly from the Holy Spirit; that is, the Spirit of the Holy God, which rested upon Him and moved through Him without measure.  Finally, the Master’s holiness is derived from His imitation of the Father.  Inasmuch as the commandments are the definitions of holiness, Messiah is likewise defined by the commandments because He kept them. Therefore, He was able to fulfill the commandment “You shall be holy, for I Yahweh your God am holy.” (Leviticus 19:2)  His holiness is a complete holiness. There are no holes in his holiness.  For us, sin is a hole in the holiness.  Each sin is an area of life where we have failed to uphold the standard of separation and change our orientation to the values and lifestyle of this world.


&lt;u&gt;Ultimate Sanctification:&lt;/u&gt;

&quot;For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest you be wearied and faint in your minds.   You have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin. &quot; 
To the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to Yahweh the judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, And to Yeshua the mediator of the renewed covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks of better things than that of Abel.  &quot;     Hebrews 12:3-4; Hebrews 12:23-24
The blood of Yeshua which effected the covenant atones completely for all sin and therefore is powerful and effective to deliver us from the power of sin in all its forms.  We are given exceedingly great promises whereby we may be partakers of the divine nature and come to the perfection of walking in His divine love and truth.    2 Peter 1: 2-11

He is able to present us faultless before His Presence (Jude 24-25) if we but give the diligence to appropriate what He has purchased for us and promised to us as our inheritance.
The complete and ultimate glorification and conformity to the likeness of God will be at Messiah Yeshua’s coming to those who have been walking in conformity to His will, according to His commandments.  


&lt;u&gt;Faithfulness to Yahweh’s call to Holiness. &lt;/u&gt; 

Because Yahweh’ people are to bear His name (Yisrael), they are to be like Him and reflect His divine nature by manifesting a separate lifestyle from the ungodly customs and sins of the surrounding nations.   This manifestation of sanctification can only be expressed with a devotion to serving Yahweh in gladness and righteousness.   For if we love Yahweh then we will keep His commands and detest those things which He abhors, and love those things which He cherishes.  His commandments are not burdensome to those who love Him.

Choosing those things which please Him goes beyond &quot;not breaking the commandments.&quot;   In fact, it is taught that it is possible for someone to live a very &quot;un-holy&quot; life without really breaking any of the written commandments.  For example, if someone sat home every day and overate kosher food, they are not technically breaking a moral commandment.  However,  that is not &quot;holy&quot; behaviour - whatever is centred in self is sinful.  
Rather, &quot;holy&quot; means to take the physical aspects of life and elevate them to achieve a harmony with the spiritual aspect of divine life - to live as Yeshua would motivate you to live in this world in your circumstances of life.

In Leviticus 19:2-3 where Yahweh says, &quot;You shall be holy since I, God, Yahweh your God, am holy&quot;,  it goes on to give the instructions in the outworking of that holiness.  Every man should revere his mother and his father and you should observe my Sabbaths etc. , on through the moral and ceremonial laws  -  &quot;I am Yahweh your God&quot;.  
Why does God command us to be holy and then list dozens of commandments in order to achieve this goal?   The commandments become a blueprint to follow to achieve the desired end.   The mirror and reflection of His holiness.
What is necessary is that we become a &quot;hearer and a doer&quot; of the Word - the Torah. 
  
The New Covenant tells us that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. Romans 10:17
We must permeate our hearing, and thereby our lives, with the holy words of God in order to be made holy.   How can a person obey Yahweh if he does not know what He has instructed us?

To be holy is to be obedient to the concepts and precepts of Torah because Torah is the expressed will of Yahweh God in writing.  Only by practicing what is written does one become holy, and the motivation to do so must come from the heart.   With a willingness of heart there is a joyful performance of His Word rather than a dutiful compliance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This module needs to be rewritten with the usual method of doing it (ie. drawing arcs and using a protractor) rather than this overly complicated one. Also, the proofs and verifications should be left out as they are unsuitable for children.

You can't use a protractor in a construction. This is a straightforward construction based on techniques presented earlier in the book. What do you believe is unsuitable about the proof? It simply explains that the three copies of the lines are the same length as their originals and that the length of the sides of the triangle are the same as the length of the copies. I don't see the point in showing a child how to do the construction without actually explaining why it works.

      <text xml:space="preserve">American history in school often starts with Columbus discovering the American continent in 1492. This produces the impression: “The Europeans have been the explorers of America and the first civilized subjects on this new continent.” But that is not true and conveys a one-sided picture of their own country to the students.
First of all scientists estimate that the Native Americans crossed the Bering Street 20.000-50.000 years ago, so the American continent originally belongs to the Indians.
Secondly the Europeans conquered a civilized continent with highly developed societies (like the Aztec or the Inca). Language and culture were complex and comparable to their own, although they prefer the image of the peaceful settlers who brought the savages values and God.
From the independence of the USA in 1776 up to 1900 the American Indians have been driven out of their original tribal areas step by step (depending on the gradual western expansion of the USA). Between 1800 and 1850 the American population had grown from 5 million to 23 million people and they needed more space than ever before. So this required a great expansion of the young Nation and therefore a “legal” and systematic resettlement of the original inhabitants of North America. 
So this summary contains the important political events concerning the Native Americans and shall explain historical developments as a short overview. 

==Overview of the 19th century's events==
*1824	The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was founded (out of the US War Department)
*1830   Indian Removal Act: the first Indian tribes as a whole had to leave their territories. Many tribes accepted the land western the Mississippi in exchange 	for their homeland, but some refused to go which caused guerrilla wars
*1838/9 Trail of tears:  the Cherokee tribe was forced to move to Oklahoma under military control and about one fourth of the tribe members died on this walk
*1869   the transcontinental railroad was finished so that the whole North American continent was finally under European control from now
*1871   Indian tribes were no longer considered independent: any issues concerning the American Indians and conflicts about land property were now exclusively handled by the US government
*1873-74 Buffalo War: Some tribes of Plains Indians tred to save the last herds of buffalo in Texas and Oklahoma from the white hunters by force of arms because the decreasing number of buffaloes (1890 only about 550 animals left from 50 million in 1800) threatened the survival of many tribes. The will to resist the Europeans was weakened (also by epidemics of smallpox and measles that wiped out whole tribes) so the American Indians were easily forced to sign contracts in which they agreed to leave their land to the USA
*By that time almost all American Indians lived in reservations
*1874 Gold was found in the Black Hills (part of the “Great Sioux-Reservation” in South Dakota). The government planed a separation from the reservation and 	an immediate relocation of the inhabitants of this areax .This led to the Indian Wars:
*1876 Little Big Horn: a battle between Indian armed forces (under Crazy Horse and 	Sitting Bull) and the 7th US cavalry regiment (under Colonel Custer). It was the 	last and most striking military success  for the  American Indians but without 	positive effects for their situation.
*1880 Start of the Boarding School Policy in the USA: Indian children had to live in European schools which was a forced “civilization” of the American Indians
*1890-92 Ghost-dance Movement: a new religious movement which encouraged the American Indians in resisting against the government and the army. Therefore the US government tightened up the control and observation of Indian leaders
*1890 Sitting-Bull was murdered which marks the ending of the Indian wars.
*1890 Wounded Knee: massacre during which about 300 Indians were killed by the US army, among the victims there were mainly women, elders and children
*1898 Curtis Act: final step by the Congress to deprive the American Indians of self-government and sovereign control over tribes land

==Overview of the 20th / 21st Century's events==
*1924 Snyder Act: All American Indians received the US citizenship
*1941 The USA entered the 2nd Word War and young Indians serve in the US Army      
*1950 Termination Policy: There were no further supports by the US government for the reservations( e.g. education, health care) and efforts were made to dissolve the reservations and to terminate all existing treaties between the government and the American Indians.
*1956 Relocation Policy aimed to attract the American Indians to leave their reservations (e.g. assimilation programs and offers for jobs and education in 	the cities). About 35.000 American Indians moved to cities as a direct result.
*1958 Alaska became a state of the USA so that the Alaskan Natives were now US citizens as well.
*1968 The AIM (American Indian Movement) was founded to represent American Indian interests and problems; activities like:
*1969 Occupation of the island Alcatraz (estate of a former federal prison) for one and a half years.		*1969 The first Indian Survival Schools were founded by American Indian traditionalists)		
*1972 »Trail of Broken Treaties«: Occupation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington D.C as a protest to arouse the government's attention to the problems and aims of the American Indians; 
*1973 Wounded Knee “II”: members of the AIM occupied the village Wounded Knee in the Pine Ridge reservation to remind to the massacre and to criticize the US policy towards the American Indians. A forcible breakup of the 	demonstration by the police and the US Army took place. However, Wounded Knee is still a symbol for the oppression of the American Indians 
*The results of these activities were international attention and legislative effects:    
*1975 Indian Self-Determination Act: the Congress guaranteed that the tribes would be supported as much as possible (in education and other issues) and far-reaching self-determination inside the reservations which showed a turning-point in Indian policy 
*1977 International Indian Treaty Council (IITC, founded 1974) became a consultant for the UNO as a non-federal organization, so the American Indians received international acknowledgment:	
*1990 Native American Languages Act was an obligation to protect and support Indian languages.
*1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act: the return of American Indian ritual objects and skeletons from museums which had been stolen from graves and holy burial places, was promised.
*1999/2000  Foundation of “Nunavut”, a sovereign Inuit nation in northern Canada

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
===Stereotypes and prejudices about the Native Americans in the USA===

It's a fact that most people don't know anything about American Indians and their current situation. The reason for this lack of knowledge probably is (besides a general tendency of our modern society to be self-centered) that most people have a fixed romanticized  image of what they call “a real Indian” which is popular and attractive and therefore not likely to be corrected:

Movies, comics and novels, e.g. the fiction of Karl May, and the childhood games have formed an idea of proud and brave warriors who live a life of privation and freedom, in deep attachment to Mother earth and nature. Their habits are savage and mysterious. Their wild appearance (tall and dark, with long plaits and dressed up in leather clothes and feathers) and the adventures on horseback are linked with them, fascinate almost everybody– a little boy as much as an adult.
However, these are stereotypes, romantic ideas of a heroic figure that has vanished a long time ago or has never existed.

Moreover this picture of a “typical Indian” which we have made up, only refers to one cultural group of the American Indians, that is the Plains Indian who is member of nomadic tribes like the Sioux, the Comanche or the Cheyenne. Also the assumption that American Indians only lived in the &quot;Wild West&quot; is completely wrong. The area in which the North American Indians had spread before the Europeans arrived, amounts to 6.1 Billion acres, an expanse which Germany would fit in more than 68 times and which contains almost any kind of climate zone and landscape. The necessary adaption to these different natural circumstances has created an immense variety of Indian cultures which can be as different in their customs as night and day, so it is impossible to talk about “the Indian” as a specific character, but rather as an individual of an ethnic group with great diversity in language, history and lifestyle.

A common mistake almost every non-Indian makes is to generalize the many different tribes and to call them all together “Indians”. It is said that the Indians prefer terms which underline that they have been the first people in North America (like “First Americans”, “Native Americans”) and that they are no exotic group but simply “people” or individuals referred to with their specific (tribal) names, like any other American. 

Another image which has come up in the recent years with conservation becoming a more and more important aspect, is the Native American as holy guard of nature who protects the animals and plants. This is a little bit bent into shape to fit in the authors' arguments.

Furthermore, the media who like to shock their audience to arouse more interest publish shots of the “modern Indians” from time to time: dull alcoholics in front of the TV who scrape a bare living in decaying reservations or guys who all run casinos.

But which image could fit?

===Who is an Indian?===
According to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (USA) one may call oneself “Indian” and receive the services offered to this ethnic minority, if one is
  
  (1)  a member of a tribe recognized by the federal government, 
  (2)  of one-half or more Indian blood of tribes indigenous to the United States; or 
  (3)  for some purposes, of one-fourth or more Indian ancestry.

However, the admission rules differ from tribe to tribe and furthermore the American Indians have mixed with people of other ethnic origin during the last centuries, which often makes it difficult to identify an unknown person as American Indian or Non-Indian.

In most of the books and articles about American Indians the author either describes their life only during the time between the arrival of the Europeans and their banishment into reservations; or he gives a one-sided description of their current situation (e.g. romanticized, shocking, etc.).

If we want to get to know the modern life of the American Indians, we should ask:

*Do the pessimistic pictures convey a realistic impression?
**What happened to the probably most popular heroes of our childhood after they had been exiled to the reservations?  
***Are they integrated or still exotic outcasts?
****Who are they? 
*****How is their life like, nowadays?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Originally the text of this wikibook had been a piece of work for the English course of a final class at a German grammar school, therefore I beg your pardon if it is not complete or in some issues wrong. I am no American Indian but I was very interested in Native Americans when I was young. So I was embarrassed about myself as I realized that I hardly know anything about the American Indians that live today, only about the period of time shortly after the arrival of the Europeans.
So when we had to find a topic for a piece of work, which had to be written in the 13th grade in our grammar school, I remembered my lack of knowledge concerning the American Indians' situation. I talked to classmates, family members and friends and found out how much (or little) they know about it. One answer was:

&quot;Oh, Indians. Are there still any?&quot;

So my decision was made. I hope you will enjoy reading and add more information, especially about Canadian First Nations, because I couldn't mention them in my piece of work (otherwise it would have had more than 100 pages) and freeware photos.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Native American Population==

For it is not easy to register American Indians and Alaska Natives without adding those of more than one race”, ( this makes up 1.6 % of the whole US population). This proves a steady increase of the American Indian population: In 1900 epidemics, starvation and wars almost had wiped out the Native Americans and only 200,000 were left. But 50 years later the number had regrown to 350,000, in 1990 it exceeded 2 million and for 2050 it is projected to be almost double the present number.

==The modern tribes and their home==

The Indigenous people belong to 500~600 federally recognized tribes in the USA, including 225 in Alaska. These are often of little membership, except the Cherokee and the Navajo nation (the most populous tribes by far) which have both more than 300,000 members.
A tribe is considered “federally recognized” if the members can prove their tribe's existence throughout the 20th century. Only then they may receive the services and benefits offered by the BIA, e.g. social services and assistance in economic development, etc.

However, there are also many tribes which are (partly) recognized by their state, but not by the BIA, for example the Wampanoag. These tribes do not get any governmental support by the BIA, so they are keen on changing their status: 150 tribes applied for federal recognition since 1978, but the Congress has signed  positive only 12 petitions by now. But no matter if their tribe is federally recognized or not, each American Indian is a US citizen today and has (in most cases) the same rights and duties as any other American.

There are 56 million acres of land held in trust for American Indians and Alaska Natives by the Secretary of the Interior which contains the federal reservations, but not all Indian reservations and 223 Alaskan village groups. The latter have no reservation status, but are often of Indian inhabitants only. As a result of the expansion of the European civilization, which forced the American Indians to withdraw farther and farther to the West, the  American Indian reservations and the areas preferred by the ones outside the reservations, are not evenly distributed over the USA. In fact most of the American Indian population is concentrated on a eleven states, most of them western the Mississippi (highest percentage among them California, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arizona), which are the home for two thirds of the American Indians.
   	        	
===American Indians outside the reservations===
 
Despite a common assumption not all the American Indians live in reservations. Actually the American Indians living outside the reservations make up the vast majority: between 64% and 85% of the American Indians do not live in one of the reservations or Indian communities in the USA but in rural areas or in big cities.

From the beginning of the expulsion in the early 19th Century there have been a few Indian communities and single families who managed to escape the authorities' notice. But the big wave of American Indians leaving their reservations has been initiated by the supportive measurements of the US government (like special benefits)in the 1950's (Termination policy and Relocation policy). At this time, a lot of American Indians left their tribe to work in big cities ( Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York had and have especially many Indian inhabitants ) or in towns not far from the reservations ( for example Oklahoma City, Minneapolis, Seattle or Phoenix).
This happened step by step: in 1970 about 45% of the American Indians already lived outside the reservations, twenty years later it were 54%.
Nowadays the “rural exodus” is still a current topic, because young American Indians believe that the cities offer many opportunities to make money and that moving is the only possibility to change their life and to escape from the hopelessness in the reservations. 

For some this dreams became reality, for example for the Iroquois, who typically have a good head for heights and profited from their unique quality by working as demanded steel construction workers or engineers on the building sites of skyscrapers in almost any big city. Now they have settled in a quarter of their own in Brooklyn in New York City, which is quite unusual because the majority of the “City Indians” is not living in ghettos.

Different from the Iroquois many other “City Indians” have been less successful: in the beginning of the Termination policy about three quarters of the American Indians returned to their reservations and today badly paid jobs and several social underclass problems in urban areas impede the life quality of many (young) American Indians. But altogether their social situation and their career prospects are better than in the reservations which can be seen in the fact that their rates of higher education (college degree and more) are constantly higher as those in the reservations, as well as their median age and their average income. This shows a slight rise on the social ladder compared to their past.

===American Indians in Reservations=== 

Only a little bit more than one third of the American Indians are residents at a reservation (or community, rancheria, pueblo etc.), which are no longer internment camps (like some reservations in the 19th century had been). However, sometimes there are  still fences and “wards”, although the inhabitants legally are free to go and live anywhere they like. On the other hand, a reservation is no paradise for Indians: they are neither living in Tipis (, but in huts, council flats or in simple prefabricated houses), nor riding on horseback. Although they are often isolated from the modern industrial society, they adapted in many ways to the European culture, e.g. Fast-Food restaurants and supermarkets opened in the reservations and satellite TV and an Internet access are available in most cases.

Today, the reservations cover 52 million acres of the Indian trust land which appears infinitely small compared with their original tribal area, that is the entire North American continent. 
American Indian Areas (in the USA there are 270-300 federal reservations, mostly western the Mississippi, and about 21 state reservations, the majority in the East) exist in all sizes and compositions: Some of the reservations are quite small (partly less than 1000 acres, the smallest comprises only 100 acres), others are very large with the Navajo Nation in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah as the largest (containing 17 million acres); some are inhabited by only one tribe, others are the home of several different tribes. 
Many reservations are inhabited by non-Indians, too, and a lot of reservation land has White owners or tenants (actually only about 140 reservations consist of exclusively tribal-owned land). 
The US government used to handle any issues concerning the American Indians in the past. Yet since 1975( Indian Self-Determination Act) the reservations are free to form their own tribal governments, which are assembled by democratic elections or out of the elder councils. This self-government is limited only as far as the states' power, i.e. the reservations are legally treated like sovereign states and the state authorities only have scarce control over them. In many reservations laws (both criminal and civil) and law enforcement are more or less independent of the surrounding. The Navajo nation for example has replaced each law of the state of Arizona by own (except the traffic regulations) and the tribe folds its own courts and police, so that only dangerous criminals have to stand trial on a non-Indian court. 
The tribes also administer their own fire brigades and social programs and are allowed to manage the usage of their natural resources on their own (although the USA violate this right from time to time). This far-reaching self-sufficiency conveys a feeling of pride and security to some of the American Indians in the reservations and so they are keen on becoming completely self-sustaining some day. As a special privilege the American Indians in reservations do not have to pay taxes of any income or trade made upon their tribal land and they (officially) receive free health care. This supportive measures are badly needed because many are on federal welfare and social benefits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Contemporary education and culture=
For more than 100 years the US government pursued a policy whose purpose has been to dissolve the structures of the tribal chief system and to assimilate the American Indian culture.

American Indian culture has been considered primitive, by the Westerns especially the European colonialists, in comparison to their more modern and advanced  culture. A lot of measures had been taken to make this plan real, for example missionary work to convert the “wild pagans” to Christianity, bans on ritual dance, worship and Indian clothes, and the separation of the American Indian children from their tribes as soon as possible and their education in special boarding schools. 

==Education &amp; tribal languages==
All the customs, songs and myths of the American Indians have been passed on by oral tradition ever since, so (for the Europeans) the most effective method to destroy the Native culture was to deprive them of their language:  
Throughout the 19th century a lot of boarding schools had been founded (often held by Christian organizations), in which the American Indian children were taught in English and should adopt the European and Christian manners and customs. They were separated from their tribes and families for several years without any visits. 

The reports about the teaching methods in this schools show that the daily life must have been a torture to the young American Indians. Talking in a tribal language and carrying on worship was harshly punished ( corporal and psychological punishment were considered normal), and the children generally were treated very badly: 
“He said that he got only one pair of shoes a year and was forced to wear them until they became too small, and his feet became crippled. He still [(today 55 years old -authoress)] has problems walking.”
They had to work, too, for there was often no money for servants and they also became victims of psychological and sexual abuse, and so the American Indians have gotten to know the European culture from its darkest side.

These boarding schools existed until late in the 20th century (the last ones were closed in the 1980's and 90'sx), by that time the number of American Indians who were still speaking their Native language had begun to shrink by alarming proportions: for example among the Mohawk (a tribe of the six Iroquois Nations) only about 5% spoke the tribal language, mostly people older than 70 years.

In order to preserve the American Indian languages from dying out, the wish to set up schools where young American Indians should be taught by Native Americans or specially trained teachers, rather than by Whites, and get in touch with their culture again, became stronger: 
In the late 1960's the first American Indian survival schools had been opened and an alliance of education authorities under American Indian control been established. Today almost all the American Indian reservations run schools of their own, partly they offer language courses for adults, too, and there even are American Indian colleges and universities (e.g. Fort Peck Community College in Montana or the Haskell Indian Nations University Kansas). The latter enable the young American Indians to achieve a secondary education combined with their own cultural values, and during the last 20 years the number of American Indians enrolling for college or university has increased by 80%.
 
Most American Indians in reservations visit the new Native schools from childhood and many of those who are going to attend higher education leave the reservations to earn more money, which is of advantage for their big families in the reservations.

The lessons in which the Native American children are taught in their tribal language helped to protect 175 American Indian dialects and had the effect that about one third of the children over five years talk in their mother tongue at home (although it is estimated that only the 20 most spoken languages will exist throughout the 21st century).
 
In comparison to the past, all this developments mark important steps of independence and success, especially for the rural American Indians, because formal education is the basis for future professional success and now the Native American children are able to learn without having to leave their families and give up their Indian language and identity. 

==Culture &amp; traditions==
Another idea to assimilate the American Indians to European culture was to convert the “wild pagans” to Christianity so many missionaries had come to North America funded by the US government. Since the Europeans harshly punished any kind of resistance against their “civilization” programs (the boarding schools have also been used as a threat to put the Native American parents under pressure), the most American Indians obeyed the new laws, stopped talking their original language and gave up the majority of their customs.

But during the 20th century the suppression of American Indian culture became less strict and successively the American Indians returned to their culture and explored  more modern mediums which had been unknown to them before: for example several  Native American newspapers have been published for the first time ( e.g. the magazine »Wassaja« (»smoke signal«) by the Cherokee (1916 /1926) and the “Navajo Times” (1943)).

In the 1970's a lot of American Indian radio stations had their first broadcasts, in tribal language of course, and today many of them are on air for about twelve hours a day (for example KYUK , Alaska, and KTDB, New Mexico). New media like the Internet and motion picture have been “discovered” by American Indians,too, and a lot of tribes are presenting themselves on websites today.   
When the government officially removed the prohibition of the American Indian culture in 1990 (→ see Native American Languages Act &amp; Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act) a great revival of the American Indian culture took place:  

===Sports===
 
Probably the best known American Indian sport is Lacrosse, a rough game played with sticks similar to butterfly nets, which originally took place when conflicts between tribes should be solved more or less peaceful and without armed force. It is still played by American Indians as well as Whites in sports clubs or in schools. 

===Contemporary music, literature and Art===

Music was (just like among other peoples) a very important part of the traditional American Indian festivities and rituals because the Indians believed it to be the language of the spirits. The singing has often been accompanied by rhythmical instruments like drums, rattles and sometimes flutes and this simple composition is still popular, but mainly during tribal festivals like Powwows (see page 18),  rather than in commercial music: There musicians with American Indian ancestry also deserve credit. Performers like for example Robbie Robertson (a member of “The Band”), Tori Amos and CocoRosie often use modern sounds and instruments ( for example electronic instruments in the case of CocoRosie), combined with poetic lyrics inspired by their tribal history ( as in the song “Yo George” by Tori Amos).

 I salute to you Commander ●  
 and I sneeze ● 'Cause I have Now ● an Allergy ● 
 To your policies it seems ● Where have we gone wrong America? ● Mr Lincoln we cannot seem ● to find you 
 anywhere out of the millions ● from the deserts ● To the mountains ● Over prairies ● to the shores (…)
                    ''excerpt of lyrics of &quot;Yo George&quot; from the album [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Doll_Posse American Doll posse] by Tori Amos''

In 1969 the first American Indian publishing house (“The Indian Historian Press”) has been founded and with its assistance ( but also published by other companies) books about and/or by Native Americans have been released. American Indian writers proved their well-known talent of storytelling by writing novels and essays, which are (partly) known and published outside the USA ( e.g. N. Scott Momaday's House Made of Dawn, (Pulitzer Prize for fiction, 1969)). Especially American Indian myths and fairy tales are very popular and therefore frequently edited anew. 

In the American Indians' arts and crafts there exists a manifold variety of techniques and styles which some of the American Indian tribes have perfected: the tribes in the Southwestern area are still famous for their pottery, jewelry, weaving and basketry which attracts a lot of tourists to these reservations, and the descendent's of the Plains Indians are still working in embroidery and feathers. 

But American Indians also take part in modern art such as abstract paintings and sculptures, which often deal with American Indian problems or concerns. Today Indian artwork has a special copyright label to prevent it from imitation.    

===Religion and rituals===

As already mentioned American Indians had been forced to acquire Christianity, so many of them are baptized and still believe in the Christian God. Others  are member of the so-called “Native-American-Church”, a denomination which is a kind of mixture of Christian values and Native American beliefs.

But the tribal pure religions (the Navajo for example believed in a goddess called “Changing Woman” and Plains Indians like the Algonquin or the Sioux believed in the natural power called “Manitu”/”Wakan”) have not disappeared: the myths and legends are still told and the religious dances and inter-tribal Powwows (modern dance festivals) are arranged several times a year all over the USA.

Many American Indians take part as competitive dancers, dressed in colorful extravagant regalia, others play traditional tunes and rhythms. These Powwows are a great attraction also to Whites, but they are no carnival or tourist entertainment, but a religious and cultural festivity with the purpose to strengthen the community spirit between the members of different tribes. Fortunately, the American Indians do not have to hide their culture any longer and they are free to pass on their heritage and traditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Economy and sources of income= 

The economic situation of the American Indians is quite variable and depending on the location, for example the average payment level in the reservations only lies at about 57% of the American Indian's wages in the cities. But today an American Indian can choose by right each job he likes and those who have the necessary higher education are working as doctors, teachers, judges, scientists, etc. or as social workers and policemen (especially in their own reservations).

The US Census of 2000 shows that less American Indians than white Americans work in the executive floors like in management and professional. But there are several firms and enterprises held by American Indians (about 200.000, the most of them in New York City, Los Angeles and Gallup, New Mexico), which often serve in construction work or repair and maintenance services and offer a lot of jobs for other American Indians.

American Indians without secondary education or any education at all often work as day laborers and/or move between the different farms and plantations, because in the reservations the job situation rarely offers vacancies.

The Native Americans in the reservations also make several profit out of their tribal land, for example they are allowed to rent it to industry and enterprises or private tenants, and they are free to pursue farming, stock-breeding, fishing and hunting. They also make use of their natural resources as wind power, timber and water power, but also petroleum, natural gas and uranium which is sold to the government or to companies of the energy industry. These organize the output in most cases and in return offer jobs for the American Indians (for example miners in the Navajo reservation). 

Another important source of income is tourism: the sale of arts and crafts as souvenirs, wellness hotels, ski slopes and other sports like backpacking, as well as museums and other cultural centers where sometimes reenactments of  American Indian battles or the historical daily life are presented to tourists (with the possibility to be entertained as well as to join).  

===Casinos===

Closely linked with tourism is the business of the American Indian casinos which is the best known aspect of American Indian economy nowadays. In 1988 the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, a special governmental law, opened up this source of income for the American Indians and allowed them to offer traditional Indian gaming and the lighter forms of gambling, such as bingo.

This development aid, which rescued many tribes out of their poverty (for example the Fort-Mohave, who once had been one of the poorest tribes in the USA, have built eleven casinos and luxury hotels), has caused a kind of economic miracle for the American Indians:
they own about 400 casinos and bingo centers in 130-160 reservations, the biggest resort casino in the world and the biggest casino in the whole USA is Foxwoods of the Mashantucket Pequot tribe in Connecticut. Most of the other “new buffalo&quot; are quite small but as a whole they yield about 20 Billion US-Dollars a year and offer jobs for half a million people, also non-Indians.

This great economical impact can be attributed to the fact that the USA have very strict rules concerning the gambling industry and in most states any kind of gambling is forbidden. But with the American Indian areas being quite independent from state's law and actually being no state territory, these prohibitions are not in force inside the reservations. Therefore the American Indians almost possess the total monopoly on gaming in the USA and it is not surprising that their main customers are Whites who bring a lot of money to the accounts of the reservation's casinos, hotels, gas stations and local business.

The casinos are subject of regular inspections by the National Indian Gaming Commission, which checks the observance to the official Gaming Regulations.    

===New ideas===

However, the modern sources of income such as mass tourism, the sale of natural resources and casinos are controversial among the American Indians. Some tribes (for example the Navajo, the Hopi and the Winnemem Wintu) reject and boycott the casinos, being thoroughly convinced that this business threatens their American Indian culture.
Furthermore the output of natural resources destroys or at least endangers the reservation's nature and wildlife. 

Therefore and because of fear that the success could end some day, many chiefs and heads of tribal governments are searching for other options to make money and in general many tribes  try to promote their traditional economic methods: for example some tribes are busy on re-naturalizing mustangs, wapiti, elks and buffalo as their traditional food. A new idea developed in the recent years is the operation of renewable resources and sustainable energy and sources of income which are and less dependent on grants and foreign interests. So gaming, land leasing and mass tourism are only considered as transitional economy which helps to give the actual objectives a start.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Current problems==
To get a realistic impression of an ethnic community, it is absolutely necessary to look at its seemy side and to analyze its problems. Due to the fact that the reservations in the USA are on a different level of development, their problems are varying and of different graveness. But in many cases one problem produces the next, so there is definitely no shortage of worrying aspects among the American Indians in the reservations as well as outside.
  
===Bad job conditions at the reservations, exploitation and environmental destruction===

Today there are only 52 million acres left from the original American Indian homeland of the about 6.1 billion acres that form North America and this trust land is mostly of inferior quality: the BIA took an investigation about the erosion on American Indian tribes land and considered the state of 12 million acres crucially, 17 million gravely, 24 million gently affected as to that.
So for many Native Americans there is no possibility to make a living by farming without the use of chemicals and in some reservations commercial hunting and fishing are prohibited.

Furthermore the lack of infrastructure (e.g., often no electricity, telephones or Internet connectivity) makes life difficult in the reservations and these drawbacks and the insufficient or partly missing links to the traffic system keep most foreign industry from installing sites in the reservations. The bad conditions complicate the foundation of American Indian businesses like casinos and tourism for some tribes, too, because they are not within easy reach from the next big city and the potential customers.

Considering these circumstances, it is not surprising that the rates of unemployment are between 50 and 70% (in some reservations they are higher than 80%), and that the American Indians have the lowest average income in the USA.

The government in the 1990s promised high financial and economic rewards to the tribes who would agree to the storage of toxic and radioactive waste on their reservation land for several decades. Many American Indians (mainly those of the poorer reservations like the Mescalero-Apache) were tempted by the money and were not aware of the consequences for their health, their environment and life base, which makes the barriers to the reservations' development even more unbreakable.

===Lack of education and poverty===

The percentage of citizens with less than a High School graduate was leveled 19.6%  among the total US population, about 10% higher for the American Indians outside the reservations  and again by 10% more for those in the reservations. The rate of students with more than a Bachelors' degree also proves the underdeveloped state of education among the American Indians, for it ranges between 8 and 13%, with an total USA average of 24%.

Furthermore the reservation schools have the highest rate of teacher turnover and they often lack the means for school supply and sufficient staff. Even those Native Americans students who could attend secondary education are inhibited by bureaucracy and the great distances to the universities.

This lack of formal education fuels other social problems like unemployment, poverty, teenage pregnancy, criminality and drug abuse and it forces the Native Americans to accept badly paid jobs. Therefore an improve of their life standards is not easy since they are also inhibited by the costs for food (which in reservations are absurdly enough higher than outside the reservations) and the financial burdens especially on City Indians, such as high rents and taxes (which they have to pay in full amount, unlike the Native Americans in the reservations).

As a result there are 24 to 25% of all American Indians who live below the poverty line and in the reservations the figure sometimes exceeds 40% of the residents. Especially poverty among children is an urgent problem, because for example in the Pine Ridge reservation (South Dakota) 46% of the American Indian children are considered poor, which is higher than the poverty rate among adults.

===Social challenges===
 
In the reservations but also outside the Native Americans have to deal with further worrying social developments: of all ethnic groups in the USA the American Indians have the

*highest rate of school drop outs (about 54%),
*highest rate of child mortality, 
*highest rate of suicide
*highest rate of teenage suicide ( 18.5 per 100,000),
*highest rate of teenage pregnancy,
*lowest life expectancy ( 55 years)

Drug abuse and alcoholism have become mass problems among the American Indians (in some reservations eight families out of ten have problems with alcoholism) and unfortunately among their children, too. For those the confrontation with unemployment, environmental destruction, the decay of the reservations and the lack of positive future prospects and leisure time activities to distract them situation, are probably hard to bare. 

Caused or at least promoted by drug abuse, there is a lot of crime in the reservations and outside of which the American Indians (especially children) are victims and offenders (especially young adults) at the same rate: Domestic violence, rape, child abuse and child neglect are reported to take place very often in the reservations, with the estimated number of unknown cases being very high.

Furthermore in the recent years gang violence in the reservations has increased, fueled by weak law enforcement, youth unemployment and the lack of activities for young Indians and with the results of vandalism, theft, assaults (also sexual) and street fights. 
 
====Shortage of housing and health problems====
 
Homelessness is considered a subject of no public interest in the US society and therefore there is little information about the homeless American Indians in the USA, but it is estimated that there are “90,000 homeless or under housed Indian families”, especially in the reservations where the shortage and decay of houses is an omnipresent challenge: old shacks (often left army buildings) and council flats which often lack of electricity, running or warm water and in more than 50% of all cases of public sewer and are in need for repair are common housing conditions.

As a result of the shortage of housing American Indian houses have to offer home for big families and their acquaintances, so that 30% of the American Indians live in overcrowded homes and sometimes “25 people [have] to live in a two-bedroom home” which promotes a lack of hygiene and the spread of diseases.

In fact the health conditions in the reservations are deplorable, anyhow:
Native Americans are suffering of diabetes, alcoholism, tuberculosis and other health conditions and are dying at shocking rates. The cases of asthma, heart failure, cancer and AIDS are also noticeable accumulated within American Indian communities (unfortunately mostly among the elders and children) and are out of all proportion to the inadequate health care system: Especially the malnutrition based diseases such as rickets and diabetes require expensive medical treatments like for example dialysis and therefore the federal health service in many reservations is overburdened.

Furthermore the consequences of pollution and contamination in some areas threaten the American Indian's health and life because toxic and radioactive traces are discovered in the drinking water, the soil, the nutrition and the bodies of the American Indians themselves. American Indian farm workers also get in touch with the “1.2 billion pounds of highly toxic pesticides sprayed on our food every year” because the safety measures such as protective clothing often are insufficient or missing. So an increase of cancer and deformity based deaths are caused by contacts with these dangerous substances.

A widespread epidemic of which children suffer when their mothers drank a lot of alcohol during pregnancy, are the “Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders” (FASD) and they appear in many different degrees of gravity: In general the central nervous system is affected and therefore these children suffer from epileptic attacks, speech disorders, learning difficulties, inhibited growth and deformed bodies and organs. These symptoms can be suppressed by medical treatment, although there is no complete remedy.

===Mental health=== 
  
In many books and films about American Indians we are shown the sins and crimes committed by the white Immigrants, which are often hard to believe. Hence it appears likely that the present generation of American Indians are still full of sadness and horror about the past, like the descendants of the Jews, whose fate seems almost comparable to the American Indians'.

Although we cannot look into the Native American heads, except if they write or talk about their feelings, it is known that the experiences for example of the boarding schools have caused traumas among the former pupils. The high rates of mental illness, alcoholism and suicide may also give evidence of the American Indians' mental condition.

A further aspect, which affects many poor Native Americans, is the dependency on federal welfare and the US government's generosity concerning health care and social benefits. 

===Discord between the American Indians===
  
Other Americans sometimes talk about “the American  Indians” as a compact group of tribes, which is a completely wrong impression: the Native American tribes have never been united altogether and even today they still behave detrimentally to each other. For example the crimes and abuses, such as corruption of Native American responsibilities to their fellow Indians' disadvantage, prove the discord between the single tribes and American Indians.

The US policy had encouraged this conflict throughout many decades, for they often placed the borders of a reservation in such a way that it surrounded another tribe's area. This policy has been quite effective and the Navajo, as an example, sold the mining rights for the area of Black Mesa without the agreement of the Hopi who worship the area as a spiritual center.

It would be interesting to know what would have happened, if the American Indians had stood solidly against the European immigrants...

===The relationship between the American Indians and the USA===

In the past discrimination has been the common reaction towards American Indians and was in no way inferior to the experiences of the African Americans, except that it is less known to the world. Similar to the Black Americans the civil rights activists who supported the Native Americans as well as Native Americans who stood up for their rights in public had become victims of social disadvantage or even political assassination.

Today the discrimination of American Indians is not as omnipresent and publicly expressed as in the past, probably because of the Native American resistance movement in the past century. Its traces, however, are still there: for example in the names of many US sports teams like “Cleveland Indians” or “Washington Redskins”, in commercial television or advertising using the image of the strong Indian for their purposes, or in the suggestions of some politicians to terminate the self-determination or existence of single tribes.

The ignorance and indifference towards the American Indian problems and concerns is  the more important strain on the relationship between the USA and the Native Americans, today (besides the memories to past injustice). Conflicts between the government and Native Americans are often solved by actions of the US army and other American Indian affairs are often treated without the adequate political sensitiveness as well: the decision whether an Indian tribe should be recognized as such is within the scope of duties of the BIA, a non-Indian organization with only partly Indian staff, which appears difficult to be cohered.

Furthermore the US government takes its time to realize a mistake and to apologize for it (e.g. the USA has not signed yet an official state resolution of 2004 to “offer an apology to all Native Peoples on behalf of the United States [for past] ill-conceived policies”).

The US government's obstinacy combined with the tribes' pride makes the removal of old  misunderstandings between the government and the American Indian tribes such as the erroneous belief that federal compensation payments for holy tribal land would be accepted by the Native Americans and (in return) that there would be another choice for the American Indians than coming to terms with the past. An even more important obstacle to the removal of the American Indian problems is the indifference among other people, such as fellow citizens who only have a vague understanding of the problems facing Native Americans today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==American Indian relief organizations== 

The problems mentioned and others impair the American Indians' chances of improving their living conditions and of giving more hopeful future prospects to their children and grand-children.

===From resistance groups to relief organizations===

So the outside world's attention had to be drawn to the Native American situation, which had been the basic idea for the foundation of the American Indian movement (AIM). The most important and best-known resistance group set up in 1968 and caused quite a stir with its militant activities like the occupation of the historic village Wounded Knee. Those were intended to remind the world to what has been done to the Native Americans and to make public, from which problems and discriminative prejudices the American Indians have to suffer. The aim was to improve the situation and to get through the general tribal self-determination.

On the other hand this radical group also caused a hardening of the front between the American Indians and the US government, so in the end the many Native Americans no longer approved of their aims and the AIM as a representative organization for American Indians lost its importance.

Nevertheless, the activities of the Native American resistance movement had the effects that many people in the USA and outside began to feel sympathy to the American Indians and founded charity organizations. The latter organize collection campaigns of money, food and everyday things like clothes. Unfortunately many of them concentrated on donation rather than support of local relief organizations, which is of course important for the families being in a plight. But it does not help the American Indians out of their misery in the long run, because they are kept in a relationship of dependence on the charities and do not have or are not able to take charge themselves.

===From charity to cooperative self-help=== 

Therefore it had been necessary to form partnerships between the donating administrators and the tribal chiefs and members and some organizations (e.g. the Friends of the Pine Ridge Reservation, the National Relief Charity) adapted to these challenges. They try to encourage the foundation of tribal relief organizations and to give them “a little push” by bureaucratic guidance and financial support. The effects are astounding: Innumerable tribally administered programs have been set up, on inter tribal level as well as limited to single reservations, and they replaced the federal US organizations for Native Americans.

Here some examples:

*The American Indian Science and Engineering Society ( AISES) is working on the promotion of American Indian and Alaska Native engineers and scientists and on the improvement of the access to secondary education for the American Indian student.
*The Center for American Indian Economic Development (CAIED) offers assistance in the economic and technological development to the tribes of Arizona and helps them to become self-sufficient in government and business.
*the Alliance for Native American Indian Rights (ANAIR) aims to protect the American Indian burial places and places of cultural heritage such as holy mountains like Mount Rushmore (inter-tribal)
*To guide tribes in environmental development and protection The Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals (ITEP) provides several programs like waste disposal, training for environmental protection and inspection and the running of advisory centers for questions about the climate change and other environmental issues concerning the Native Americans.
*The Indian Health Service's goal is to achieve adequate health care and sensitive medical staff for all American Indians and Alaska Natives and to improve the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of the Natives as far as possible.
*The American Indian Prevention Coalition inc.(AIPC) tries to sub indigenous families and communities in prevention and recovery programs against drug-addiction especially among teenagers and children (in reservations and cities).  
*Held as a non-profit organization the National Indian Gaming Association (NIGA) serves as a supervision authority in gaming regulations, as office to turn to for American Indians for issues of educational, economical and legislative nature and as agent between the Native Americans and the US executives.
*The Indian Arts and Crafts Association's (IACA) efforts are targeted to the promotion, marketing and safeguard of authentic American Indian art.
*Futures for Children is an organization which manages mentoring, educational and psychological training, family support and encouraging programs for students in New Mexico and Arizona.

In correspondence with the non-Indian charity associations, the American Indian relief organizations try to help the Native Americans to stand on their own feet again without the necessity of federal welfare and give them the chance to life a live worthy for the original inhabitants of North America.

Hi. Based on various talkpage discussions (at [[w:Talk:Bonsai]] and elsewhere), I've copied across all the content from [[w:Bonsai#Care]], to here. I've placed it at [[Bonsai/Care]], which is hopefully a good location. Please tell me if I've made any glaring mistakes or mis-assumptions, as there might be additional content to follow! Thanks.

Sure, good Idea, I hadn't seen there was content around. [[User:Richardofoakshire|Richardofoakshire]] ([[User talk:Richardofoakshire|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Richardofoakshire|contribs]]) 11:51, 6 March 2011 (UTC)

==Non-traditional bonsai==
I gave non-traditional bonsai its own section to not conflict with the Japanese traditional bonsai. Its helpful to describe how Japanese style bonsai works. Since the term Bonsai has two related definitions, I could put the umbrella term under this section to include all miniature tree gardening without conflicting with the rest of the book's focus. I hope that works out. [[User:Sidelight12|Sidelight12]]''' &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Sidelight12|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:15, 17 December 2012 (UTC)</text>

Bonsai (盆栽 Japanese) (lit. tray cultivation) is the art of growing trees, or woody plants shaped as trees, in containers. Bonsai does not require genetically dwarfed trees, but rather depends on growing small trees from regular stock and seeds. Bonsai uses cultivation techniques like pruning, root reduction, potting, defoliation, and grafting to produce small trees that mimic the shape and style of mature, full-sized trees.
The purposes of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and the pleasant exercise of effort and ingenuity (for the grower). By contrast with other plant cultivation practices, bonsai is not intended for production of food, for medicine, or for creating yard-sized or park-sized landscapes. Instead, bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping of one or more small trees in a single container.
'Bonsai' is a Japanese pronunciation of the earlier Chinese term penzai (盆栽). A 'bon' is a tray-like pot typically used in bonsai culture. The word bonsai is sometimes used as an umbrella term for all miniature trees in containers or pots, but this article focuses primarily on bonsai as defined in the Japanese tradition. Similar practices in other cultures include the Chinese tradition of penjing and the miniature living landscapes of Vietnamese hòn non bộ.&lt;ref&gt;Bonsai. In Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you acquired a young tree from a garden center or nursery, or if you have collected a yamadori, you will need to accommodate your tree in pot. Placing your tree in a beautiful, shallow, especially made bonsai pot may seem tempting at first, however It is recommended you plant your tree into a training pot first. This allows the tree to get used to a life in a container and will store more water. Just after repotting, enough water is very important.
#First, cut the tip off the larger roots, this encourages new growth. Don't take too much, or your tree can dry out.
#Because you removed some roots, and with that a part of the water supply, remove some foliage too. Don't cut anything you'll regret later - just about as much as you took away at the roots.
#Make sure your pot is large enough. If there are no water holes in the bottom, cut some out.
#Cover the water holes with mesh. This prevents the soil from falling out, lets air in and water out.
#Put a bit of soil in, about two centimeters is enough.
#Now place your bonsai in.
#While carefully holding your bonsai straight, fill in soil around the roots.
#Water your bonsai.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Buying a Bonsai==
===Bonsai Store===
Buying a young bonsai and then shaping it to your desire is probably the easiest way of achieving one. Most garden stores sell bonsai, but they usually carry only a small amount, to that of bad quality. If you wish to have a larger selection, I recommend that you visit a bonsai store.
When you buy a bonsai, you should always check it for the following:
 
*     Does it look natural? (It should)
*     Are there any marks of wires on the bark? If yes, don't buy it.
*   Is the tree sturdy? Do not buy a tree that looks like a branch stuck into the soil half an hour ago.
*      Do you see surface roots? If there are none, that is not a neccesary minus, there could be beautiful roots underneath the soil.
*      If there are wires, does it seem the branches will stay in place if the wires are removed? They should.
*      Are there glued-on rocks? If yes, don't buy the tree, because it will be difficult to repot later.
 
If you are unsure of the trees’ quality, you should ask the storeowner or a worker if they can tell you its history. If they cannot, the bonsai is probably of mass production. Nevertheless, if it would be your first bonsai, it could be of use for practice.

===Buying Nursery Trees===
A cheaper alternative to buying a bonsai is buying a young tree from a nursery. You will find all sorts of trees of all ages. Buy a tree that is about as tall as you want your final result to be.

==Yamadori==

If you have decided against buying your bonsai, you might want to take out into the country and find your own tree. I advocate that you bring a few tools along. A shovel, a plastic bag, and large pruning shears always come in handy. When you are looking for a tree, look for a sturdy but not too large tree that has nice foliage. Try to find a tree with no or little fungus. Lichens, moss, and vines are okay. You can remove them later if you want to. If you see any part of the bark removed or damaged, there is a chance the tree will be infected with some disease.
Once you have found a tree you like, check if you are on someone’s’ property. If so, go ask the owner of the land for permission before you dig. If you are in a national or state park, you cannot dig there.
To start digging, estimate the size of the root ball. The roots’ span is usually two to three times the crown’s size. Then take the shovel and cut down into the soil at a reasonable distance from the tree. (You’ll be the one to clean up afterwards.) When you have your tree dug up, lift it out of the ground and place it in a bag. Be sure to leave some soil on the roots to ensure proper sturdiness of the tree.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A good bonsai is one, that looks just as if it were a real, big tree, just smaller. The idea is to symbolize and simplify the look of a natural tree.

==Stem Composition==
When your tree is ready to be shaped into a bonsai, the first thing to do is to choose a front side. This side should be the one people should look at if your bonsai is ever displayed. Then, choose what style your tree should be in. Deciduous trees are probably not as qualified for Bunjingi, Kengai, and Han-Kengai as coniferous ones, but you can experiment. Try looking at some trees in nature, try drawing them. That will give you a feel for what looks natural, for what doesn't.
If you have chosen a style that fits your tree well, (feel free to make up your own) choose a large, sturdy branch about one third up from the bottom of the stem. It should point to the right or left of the tree, never to the back or front. Reduce this branches length to 6 to 8 times the stems diameter at its thickest point. Remove all branches below this one to make the stem visible. The second branch should be pointing to the opposing side of the first one. The third one should point to the back to give your tree some depth. All other branches will follow in this manner: side, other side, back, side, other side…

Also, I've been told that Juniorspace doesn't count toward the 100 edits, and I plan to do the majority of editing in Juniorspace, so, yeah...

{{edit filter navigation}}
The '''[[Special:AbuseFilter|Edit filter]]''' is a tool used to allow trusted users to set specific controls on user activity and create automated reactions for certain behaviors.

The [[mw:Extension:AbuseFilter|Abuse Filter extension]] was developed by [[w:User:Werdna|Werdna]] with support from the Wikimedia Foundation, and went live on the English Wikibooks in August 2010. Nearly all user-facing elements of the filter refer to it as the &quot;Edit filter&quot; as not all the edits it flags are abusive. In the software and special pages it retains its original name.

The extension allows automatic filters/heuristics to be applied to all edits. Specific rules can be developed, such as &quot;users with fewer than 500 edits are blocked from moving pages to titles which match this regular expression: /poop/&quot;. Of course, the rules can get quite a bit more complicated.

Log entries and filters are viewable by autoconfirmed users. For all filters, including those hidden from public view, a brief, general summary of what the rule targets will be available, and displayed in the log, the list of active filters, and in any error messages generated by the filter.

Implementation of AbuseFilter on Wikibooks is being done with due caution&amp;mdash;most edit filters should be tested for a few days (in &quot;log only&quot; mode) before being brought to full force (&quot;warn&quot;, &quot;disallow&quot;, or &quot;throttle&quot; modes). Only administrators are allowed to modify any of the filters. 

== Extension documentation ==
=== Filtering criteria ===
For all of the following, we can do extensive normalization, regex matching, length comparison and regular comparisons (less than, greater than, equal to) matching, combining different filters with Boolean logic.

==== User ====
* Edit count.
* Account age.
* Groups.
* Email-confirmed status.

==== Titles (moved-to, moved from included) ====
* Namespace.
* Title.
* Full text.
* Restrictions and protection status.

==== Action ====
* The action type (edit, move or createaccount).
* Edit summary.
* Contents of the edit.

==== Throttling ====
*Filters can specify whether actions done at a certain rate are by the same IP address, account, /16 range, account-creation-date, and/or to the same page, for a consequence (below) to be invoked.
* Any of the above conditions can be combined to produce a separate rate-limiter. For instance, we can group all accounts created on the same date, from the same /16, for the purposes of rate-limiting.
* Any actions set for that filter will occur if, and only if, the rate-limiter is tripped. This reduces false-positives by making the filter apply only if the same user is consistently tripping a particular filter, rather than a single false-positive.

=== Actions which can be assigned in response to filtered edits ===
If a user triggers a filter, the edit filter can apply any of the following sanctions based on the severity of the offense:
* All actions triggering a filter are logged at a special page.
* The user's action can be tagged for further review.
* The user can be warned that their actions may be unconstructive.
* The user's action may be disallowed.
* The user's account may have its autoconfirmed status removed.

The following actions are currently not available on this wiki:
* The user's account may be blocked from editing, along with all IP addresses used in the last 7 days.
* The user's account may be removed from all privileged groups (such as sysop or bot).

Note: Individual sanctions can be disabled selectively. Any administrator can [[Special:AbuseFilter/tools|restore autoconfirmed status]] in case of an error.

=== Monitoring ===
All edits triggering an action will produce a report at [[Special:AbuseLog]]. On this page, a brief log entry is entered. Users with the appropriate permissions may view the log summary. Administrators may view details on the log entry. This includes all information available to the filter when it ran, and may be useful for debugging purposes.  CheckUsers may view private data about the action which caused the log event, such as the user's IP address.  The edit can also be tested against another existing or proposed filter via an &quot;examine&quot; link.

==== Sample log entries ====
[[Image:AbuseLog-Sample.png|thumb|A sample detailed log entry]]
* 06:43, 23 June 2008: [[User:Example|Example]] ([[User talk:Example|discuss]] | [[Special:Contributions/Example|contribs]] | [[Special:Block/Example|block]]) triggered filter 1, making an edit on [[Main Page]]. Actions taken: Warn, disallow; Filter description: Test Filter (details | examine)

* 06:42, 23 June 2008: [[User:Example|Example]] ([[User talk:Example|discuss]] | [[Special:Contributions/Example|contribs]] | [[Special:Block/Example|block]]) triggered filter 1, making an edit on [[Main Page]]. Actions taken: Warn; Filter description: Test Filter (details | examine)
* 06:42, 23 June 2008: [[User:Example|Example]] ([[User talk:Example|discuss]] | [[Special:Contributions/Example|contribs]] | [[Special:Block/Example|block]]) triggered filter 2, making an edit on [[Main Page]]. Actions taken: None; Filter description: Test Filter (details | examine)
* 06:22, 23 June 2008: [[User:Example|Example]] ([[User talk:Example|discuss]] | [[Special:Contributions/Example|contribs]] | [[Special:Block/Example|block]]) triggered filter 1, making an edit on [[Main Page]]. Actions taken: Warn, Disallow; Filter description: Test Filter (details | examine)
* 06:22, 23 June 2008: [[User:Example|Example]] ([[User talk:Example|discuss]] | [[Special:Contributions/Example|contribs]] | [[Special:Block/Example|block]]) triggered filter 2, making an edit on [[Main Page]]. Actions taken: None; Filter description: Test Filter (details | examine)

The details link brings up a screen like that on the right.

=== Safeguards ===
To protect the wiki against poorly configured filters, a technical limit is imposed on the maximum percentage of actions that will trigger a given filter. Other technical limits are in the process of being written.

=== Notification ===
All notifications are based on the template {{[[template:edit filter warning|edit filter warning]]}}.

Standard notifications shown to a user triggering a filter '''action''':

{| class=wikitable
! Message name
! Message text
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;[[MediaWiki:abusefilter-disallowed|abusefilter-disallowed]]&lt;/tt&gt;
| {{MediaWiki:abusefilter-disallowed}}
&lt;!-- not currently enabled on en wiki
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;[[MediaWiki:abusefilter-blocked|abusefilter-blocked]]&lt;/tt&gt;
| {{MediaWiki:abusefilter-blocked}}
--&gt;
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;[[MediaWiki:abusefilter-degrouped|abusefilter-degrouped]]&lt;/tt&gt;
| {{MediaWiki:abusefilter-degrouped}}
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;[[MediaWiki:abusefilter-autopromote-blocked|abusefilter-autopromote-blocked]]&lt;/tt&gt;
| {{MediaWiki:abusefilter-autopromote-blocked}}
|}

Generic '''warning''' message is below. Administrators are advised to use custom warnings.
{| class=wikitable
! Message name
! Message text
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;[[MediaWiki:abusefilter-warning|abusefilter-warning]]&lt;/tt&gt;
| {{MediaWiki:abusefilter-warning}}
|}

Some existing filters and their warnings:

{| class=wikitable
! Filter and message
! Message text
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
| [[Special:AbuseFilter/1|1: large deletions]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;[[MediaWiki:abusefilter-warning-removal|removal]]&lt;/tt&gt;
| {{MediaWiki:abusefilter-warning-removal}}
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
| [[Special:AbuseFilter/3|3: link spamming]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;[[MediaWiki:abusefilter-warning-link-spam|possible link spam]]&lt;/tt&gt;
| {{MediaWiki:Abusefilter-warning-link-spam}}
|}


If a filter is set to warn and disallow, then a user clicking &quot;Save page&quot; will alternatively see that warning and standard [[MediaWiki:Abusefilter-disallowed|disallowed]] message.

==Known issues==
When the extension is initially installed, the available actions will '''not''' include blocking or removing from privileged groups. This restricted usage has been determined by community consensus, and if the extension is successful, the community may decide to enable the &lt;tt&gt;block&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;rangeblock&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;degroup&lt;/tt&gt; actions for use on this wiki.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{edit filter navigation}}

{{warning|[[Wikibooks:Edit filter|Edit filter]]s are very powerful tools - do not underestimate the damage errors can cause. If you're new to this, make sure you get appropriate input from editors more experienced with edit filters.}}

== Creating a filter ==
This section explains how to create a filter with some preliminary testing, so you don't flood the [[Special:AbuseFilter/history|history page]].
* Read documentation  at [[mw:Extension:AbuseFilter/RulesFormat]]
* Test some expressions at [[Special:AbuseFilter/tools|debugging tools]]:
*: for example, evaluate &lt;code&gt;'some string' rlike 'myregexp'&lt;/code&gt; to test your regexp;
*: true expression evaluates to &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;, false shows nothing
* Manually test your code at [[Special:AbuseFilter/test|batch testing]] page:
*: find someone who recently made an edit that you're trying to target, 
*: put that username in &quot;Changes by user&quot; field and click &quot;test&quot; button; 
*: if you don't see positive triggers:
*:: check &quot;show changes that do not match the filter&quot; and click &quot;test&quot; again
*:: find the edit that you targeted and click on &quot;(details)&quot;
*:: check the variables and maybe return back to [[Special:AbuseFilter/tools|debugging tools]]
* [[Special:AbuseFilter/new|Create]] idle (logging only) filter
*: in the notes field add something like &quot;Testing phase, will add a warning&quot;
*: let the idle filter run for a while to test for false positives and negatives
* Post a message at [[Wikibooks talk:Edit filter]], so other administrators have a chance to fix your code or improve the warning
* Finally, fully enable your filter, e.g. add warning, prevention, tagging, etc

== Controlling efficiency ==
Because these filters are run on every single edit, a poorly worded filter has the strong potential to severely slow down editing or even cause some larger pages to time out. However, some very minor changes in how the conditions are ordered can greatly decrease the running time of the filters. Making use of the order of operations in this way can make the difference between a good filter and one that must be disabled for performance reasons.

=== Order of operations ===
Operations are generally done left-to-right, but there is an order to which they are resolved. As soon as the filter fails one of the conditions, it will stop checking the rest of them (due to [[w:short-circuit evaluation|short-circuit evaluation]]) and move on to the next filter. The evaluation order is:
# Anything surrounded by parentheses (&lt;tt&gt;(&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt;) is evaluated as a single unit.
# Turning variables/literals into their respective data. (i.e., &lt;tt&gt;article_namespace&lt;/tt&gt; to 0)
# Function calls (&lt;tt&gt;norm&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;lcase&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.)
# Unary + and - (i.e. &lt;tt&gt;-1234&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;+1234&lt;/tt&gt;)
# Keywords 
# Boolean inversion (&lt;tt&gt;!x&lt;/tt&gt;)
# Exponentiation (&lt;tt&gt;2**3 → 8&lt;/tt&gt;)
# Multiplication-related (multiplication, division, modulo)
# Comparisons. (&lt;, &gt;, ==)
# Boolean operations. (&amp;, |, ^, in)

=== Making expensive operations cheaper ===
When using keywords such as &lt;tt&gt;rlike&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;in&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;contains&lt;/tt&gt;, the filter must go through the entire string variable to look for the string you're searching for. Variables such as &lt;tt&gt;old_wikitext&lt;/tt&gt; have the tendency to be very large. Sometimes you will be able to approximate these variables by using smaller ones such as &lt;tt&gt;added_lines&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;removed_lines&lt;/tt&gt;, which the filter can process much faster. Also, using a check for &lt;tt&gt;old_size&lt;/tt&gt; can also help to ensure that you're not going to even try checking a large block of wikitext.

You should always order your filters so that the condition that will knock out the largest number of edits is first. Usually this is a user groups or a user edit count check; in general, the last condition should be the regex that is actually looking for the sort of vandalism you're targeting.

[[Category:Wikibooks edit filter|Requested]]

This page is for non-administrators or people without sufficient knowledge about the coding involved to make requests to enact edit filters. Please add a new section ''at the top'' of current requests using the following format:

&lt;pre&gt;
==Filter name==
*'''Task''': What is the filter supposed to do? To what pages and editors does it apply?
*'''Reason''': Why is the filter needed.
- ~~~~
&lt;/pre&gt;

Bear the following in mind:

* Filters are applied to ''all'' edits. Therefore, problematic changes that apply to a single page are likely not suitable for an edit filter.
* Each filter takes time to run, making editing (and to some extent other things) slightly slower. The time is only a few milliseconds per filter, but with enough filters that adds up.
* There is a limit to what filters can check for. More complex, non-essential tasks, such as those that need to perform a more in-depth check of the page or fetch information that the filter system does not have access to, are better served by separate software, run by an individual user on their own machine, or dedicated server such as the Toolserver, rather than those used to actually host Wikibooks.
* It is not called the '''abuse''' filter for a reason. Contributors are not expected to have read every policy, guideline, and style page. Trivial formatting mistakes and edits that at first glance look fine but go against some obscure style guideline or convention are not suitable candidates for an edit filter&amp;mdash;quite apart from performance concerns, if it doesn't harm the project, it is best not to hassle new contributors because of it.
* For prevention of creation of pages with certain names, [[MediaWiki:Titleblacklist]] is usually a better way to handle the problem.

== Poop vandalism ==
*'''Task''': detect &quot;Poop&quot; vandalism
*'''Reason''': A major abuse filter on enwiki. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikijunior:Ancient_Civilizations/Norse&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1932230 I reverted an instance of poop vandalism]. I have a filter from test wikipedia you can use. '''—[[User:I-20|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;I-20&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:I-20|&lt;span style=&quot;vertical-align:super;&quot;&gt;the highway&lt;/span&gt;]]''' 20:58, 12 September 2010 (UTC)
**We do have a filter, but it needs more words. '''—[[User:I-20|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;I-20&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:I-20|&lt;span style=&quot;vertical-align:super;&quot;&gt;the highway&lt;/span&gt;]]''' 21:01, 12 September 2010 (UTC)
***The filter at test.wikipedia.org is hidden.  I'll be happy to make any additions you'd like.

****I know it's hidden. I can send the filter via email. '''—[[User:I-20|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;I-20&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:I-20|&lt;span style=&quot;vertical-align:super;&quot;&gt;the highway&lt;/span&gt;]]''' 00:55, 15 September 2010 (UTC)

== Large Scale Hidden IP Vandalism ==
See the discussion at the bottom of my Talk Page.  It seems there has been some strange vandalism where large amounts of seemingly normal text have been added to pages by IP users which mostly consists of text copied from Wikipedia with some useful parts left in.  It's gone undetected mostly.  Would it be easy to set up an edit filter which warns or doesn't permit when an IP user adds more than, say, 10,000 bytes?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:15, 18 March 2013 (UTC)

: New edits can do this. Filters cannot be applied to old edits though. I think tagging the edits as &quot;big edits&quot; should be the way to go and should be applied to everyone, not just IP users. Big edits can then be easily examined by everyone. Some registered users have copied text from Wikipedia and other websites at times too. No telling how many of those have gone undetected as well. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:28, 19 March 2013 (UTC)

::The suggestion by Dirk is that this is vandalism rather than cases of unknowledgeable editors and it seems to be only IP editors.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 07:20, 19 March 2013 (UTC)

:::A filter will find 10,000 bytes by an unknowledgeable IP editor with good intentions, an IP editor who waited until they had a lot written before submitting their work, and vandalism. I think &lt;s&gt;AGF&lt;/s&gt; assuming nothing and letting things slip through is better than assuming its all bad. Applying a tag will allow all to be found, and people to address only those situations where there is an actual problem. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:26, 19 March 2013 (UTC)

:::: The ideal, of course, is not to AGF but rather (taking a tip from Wikinews&amp;nbsp;:-) to not ABF.  But the point is well made.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 17:47, 19 March 2013 (UTC)</text>

;Description
: I was editing a wikibooks page on thin layer chromatography under the major headline of structural biochemistry. This contribution in which I was attempting to make was to include a little more information about the retardation factor between a solvent and a compound of interest in climbing up a silica based gel. This contribution also included a descriptive picture, as well as a  formula in which to actually calculate the retardation factor.

It was the &quot;retardation factor&quot; that triggered the filter due to it trying to detect vandalism with the word &quot;retard&quot; in it.  I've adjusted the filter so that it should not affect you again.  I also added the text to the page you were attempting to add.

:It was triggering because of the &quot;[]&quot; in the code, which was triggering the &quot;test edit&quot; filter, as the &quot;[]&quot; is a result of one of the buttons you see below the edit box.  Sometimes vandals will go and try to edit a page and hit a bunch of the toolbar buttons.  That filter was designed to catch that.  I removed the portion of it that would look for the &quot;[]&quot; since I see it's used often in C++ code. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:48, 4 November 2010 (UTC)

;Description
: This is a discussion of performance enhancements available for the Jeep Liberty.  The last sentence of the paragraph currently states that there is only one vendor of ECU flash updates for the Liberty Diesel.  Having been investigating this update for my Liberty, I am aware of at least one other vendor of ECU flash updates:  Green Diesel Engineering.  

I edited the last sentence to read as follows:
&quot;The ECU on the 2.8L CRD is made by Bosch, and at this time there are at least two companies offering a re-flash for the CRD ECU: one is [http://www.greendieselengineering.com Green Diesel Engineering] and the other is [http://www.inmotionusa.com INMOTION TUNING].&quot;

However, when I attempted to save this edited sentence, it was flagged by the automatic program as being Unconstructive. 

Note:  Regrettably, due to problems with the login program, I was unable to login with my Wikipedia username, Biscuiteater57, nor was I able to register separately under my Wikipedia username (which I prefer to do).  I received error messages that the username already exists in the unified user login, but also that the username does not exist.  I have submitted a trouble ticket about this problem.

;Description
: I was editing the page &gt; the content under the title &quot;McComiskey&quot; 
(McComiskey, Bruce. &quot;Disassembling Plato's Critique of Rhetoric in the Gorgias (447a-466a).&quot; Rhetoric Review 11 (1992): 79-90.
McComiskey concurs that Plato scholars do not contest Plato’s disdain for the sophists. However, Plato’s treatment of sophist rhetoric, particularly that of Gorgias, the Leontini rhetorician, divides scholars: some—Kathleen Freeman, Terence Irwin, and W.H. Thompson among others—read Plato’s treatment of Gorgias the sophist as fair and accurate; conversely, McComiskey, drawing his argument from extant fragments of Gorgias, sees these views as distorted and unfounded.
Plato presents this distorted view of Gorgias’ rhetoric to gain the favor of an audience leery of anti-democratic sentiments. Plato’s audience would have memories of the tyranny of the Four Hundred and of the tyranny of the Thirty freshly in mind. These bloody revolts temporary supplanted Greek democracy with a Socrates-Plato endorsed oligarchy. Gorgias the sophist supported democracy; thus, Plato’s readers were unlikely to accept Socrates’ “defeat” of Gorgias if Plato did not depict Gorgias’ rhetoric in a conflicting and absurd light.
McComiskey explains that unlike Socrates and Plato whose epistemology is foundational, based on some “external reality or immutable truth” against which to compare, to weigh impressions, Gorgias the sophist adheres to a relativistic epistemology based on the kairotic , the opportune, moment. Since human’s understanding of reality is filtered through the distortion of our senses, a kairotic moment is necessary to “unite disparate subjective” images (205). McComiskey concludes that Plato’s rendering of Gorgias’ rhetoric could never be supported by Gorgias’ the sophist’s relativistic epistemology.)

I think it was the URL spam (copy paste of a section of links I had on another page) the filter will not detect commutative edits (of the same content), I've completed the action and I doubt that a change in the filter would be required or result in improvement (even so a reviewer should be considered trustworthy enough to be excluded from this type of spam detection, or at least susceptible to engage in constructive dialog if any deviation is detected, and it would be ground to have the reviewer status removed).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 00:13, 23 September 2011 (UTC)

:Well, not it worked, after I tried again after a while. Strange error.
:It does appear strange.  Seems to be some kind of prevention for new or unregistered users adding large amounts of text in one go which might suggest a copy and paste of copyrighted text.  Hopefully someone who knows the Filters better can help.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:35, 20 April 2014 (UTC)
:I believe, after looking a little more, that this filter prevents unregistered users from creating lots of new pages within a short space of time.  I have lowered the time that this filter kicks in.  The filter will now allow unregistered users to create 2 new pages every 10 minutes.  If this is an inconvenience then maybe it could be lowered further otherwise I would suggest logging in or registering an account.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:46, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

:I'm not great with the edit filter but I may have a look to see what the problem is.  I suspect that it doesn't allow very new users to create a user page with external links until they've made a few edits.  Anyway, for now, I have copied the above text onto your user page so hopefully you can now edit it to your heart's content.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:15, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
:A quick look tells me that you triggered the filter because you created a new account and quickly created a new page with an external link.  If you had waited a while (say, 20 minutes) or made edits elsewhere first then it would have allowed it.  This filter is necessary at the moment because daily we receive a substantial amount of spam from spambots which make similar edits.  I'm sorry you were inconvenienced - hopefully everything will be fine for you from now on.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:19, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

: Trying to create this page:

== Maintaining Sort Order ==
Python does not provide modules like C++'s set and map data types as part of its standard library. This is a concious decision on the part of Guido, et al to preserve &quot;one obvious way to do it.&quot; Instead Python delegates this task to third-party libraries that are available on the [https://pypi.python.org/pypi Python Package Index]. These libraries use various techniques to maintain list, dict, and set types in sorted order. Maintaining order using a specialized data structure can avoid very slow behavior (quadratic run-time) in the naive approach of editing and constantly re-sorting. Several implementations are described here.

* [http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/ Python SortedContainers Module] - Pure-Python implementation that is fast-as-C implementations. Implements sorted list, dict, and set data types. Testing includes 100% code coverage and hours of stress. Documentation includes full API reference, [http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/performance.html performance comparison], and contributing/development guidelines.
* [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rbtree Python rbtree Module] - Provides a fast, C-implementation for dict and set data types. Based on a red-black tree implementation.
* [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/treap Python treap Module] - Provides a sorted dict data type. Uses a treap for implementation and improves performance using Cython.
* [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bintrees Python bintrees Module] - Provides several tree-based implementations for dict and set data types. Fastest implementations are based on AVL and Red-Black trees. Implemented in C. Extends the conventional API to provide set operations for dict data types.
* [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Banyan Python banyan Module] - Provides a fast, C-implementation for dict and set data types.
* [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/skiplistcollections Python skiplistcollections Module] - Pure-Python implementation based on skip-lists providing a limited API for dict and set data types.
* [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blist Python blist Module] - Provides sorted list, dict and set data types based on the &quot;blist&quot; data type, a B-tree implementation. Implemented in Python and C.

If I am not mistaken, this is the second time I've attempted to improve content and been prevented to on wikibooks (other was a different topic). It is especially galling when the content I posted was on the DISCUSSION page, not the article page! Hopefully, I will remember your restrictive software and never contribute to WB again.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 09:07, 16 August 2010 (UTC)

== Book medium ==
I've restored the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Image Portfolio]] to its previous state. The mention to use a bookmark may only make sense in special circumstances and to some users, but of more importance is that you shouldn't assume the media the book is in (there are special boxes that will prevent some information to be present on the print version). Remember not to assume the media the book is in or you will limit the portability of its content.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 09:13, 16 August 2010 (UTC)</text>

==Welcome!==
[[Wikibooks:Welcome|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be directly attributed to you.
* The use of your own [[Help:Watching pages|watchlist]] to monitor pages that you are interested in.
* A personal user page and [[Help:talk page|talk page]].
* The ability to [[Help:Preferences|customize]] certain aspects of the Wikibooks interface.
* The ability to rename pages.
* The eligibility to become an [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrator]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].

:''For the list of tags, see [[Special:Tags]].''

'''Tags''' (i.e., edit tags) are brief messages that the software automatically places next to certain edits in [[Help:Tracking changes#Page history|histories]], [[m:Help:Recent changes|recent changes]], and other special pages. The list of tags is at [[Special:Tags]]. They all come from the [[Wikibooks:Edit filter|Edit Filter]]; administrators can direct an edit filter to tag edits matching the filter.

Edits may be filtered by entering a tag in the [[Special:Contributions]] or [[Special:RecentChanges]] Tag text box.

==Use and formatting==
Tags shouldn't be overly specific, instead the log should be directly used for review of edits.

For each tag, the respective appearance and description system messages can be accessed from [[Special:Tags]]. They should be created in the usual format, using a &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Special:Tags|Tags]]:&lt;/nowiki&gt; prefix for the appearance.

Tags should generally not be renamed from the edit filter interface when they have already been applied to edits, as this would create a new tag. So make sure to use the correct name from the start, or change the tag description itself. Currently, there's no way to delete or reassign tags.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==How to change the name of your Leaf==

&lt;p&gt;As always you should back up your files before changing anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open your '''Leaf.lisp''' and use the '''Find''' function (In LispWorks this is in the Edit menu) and search for '''&quot;NAME YOUR ROBOT&quot;''' with the &quot;&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
In the line below it where it says &lt;nowiki&gt;(defconstant robot &quot;Leaf&quot;)&lt;/nowiki&gt; is where you change your robots name so go ahead and take your pick, just change &quot;Leaf&quot; to what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Save the file, compile and close it, now open your '''Speech.xml''' and add your robots name to the end of the list of names and save the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it, next time you start up Leaf your robot should respond to its new name.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This will show you how to create a special page.

== MySpecialPage.php ==

This file registers the special page.

  parent::__construct();
 }

 function execute($par) {

  $output = &quot;Hello! Your lucky number is '''$d'''!&quot;;
  $wgOut-&gt;addWikiText($output);
 }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This is the special page itself. It should say something like Hello! &quot;Your lucky number is '''3'''&quot;!

The Ergative alignment, formally known as '''Absolutive-Ergative''' alignment, is a rather common grammatical case system. Absolutive-Ergative differentiates between the '''Agent''', it being marked in the '''Ergative''' case, from the '''Subject''', with the fusion of both seen in '''Nominative-Accusative''' systems. The '''Absolutive''' case
marks the '''Object''' and '''Subject''' the same, often leaving them unmarked.
==Distribution and Spread==
The Absolutive-Ergative system is almost absent in Indo-European languages which are by far mostly Nominative-Accusative. In Europe, the only Ergative language is Basque. Ergative languages are spread thinly throughout the world, with certain pockets that contain a high concentration of Ergative languages. While Absolutive-Ergative languages cover an area from north Canada to Tibet and Iran, one of the main concentrations are in the Caucasus languages (think Georgian), Australian ones, and Eskimo-Aleut. Other Ergative languages exist, and Tibetan is a good example.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Stock footage''', and similarly, '''archive footage''', '''library pictures''' and '''file footage''' are film or video footage that is not custom shot for use in a specific film or television program. Stock footage is of beneficial use to filmmakers as it is far cheaper than shooting new material. A single piece of stock footage is a &quot;stock shot&quot; or a &quot;library shot&quot;.

== Where can I acquire stock footage? ==
There are many ways to acquire stock footage; a partial list of websites to acquire such footage is available [http://desktopvideo.about.com/od/videoprojects/tp/stock-footage-websites.htm here].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Imagine, if you will, some monkeys.
Unlike the common stereotype of &quot;monkey see, monkey do&quot;,
these monkeys are rebellious, contrarian monkeys.
Each one always do the *opposite* of what it sees the monkey in front of it doing.
When one monkey stands up, the monkey who sees it insists on laying down.
When one monkey lays down, the monkey who sees it insists on standing up.

Now place 4 of these monkeys, one at each of the 4 corners outside a skyscraper, so each one can only see the one monkey in front of him.
When a prankster comes along and tickles the first monkey until the monkey rolls on the floor laughing (ROFL), the next monkey sees that and insists on standing tall. The following monkey diagonally opposite the laughing monkey can't see the laughing monkey through the building, but he can see the standing monkey on the corner in front of him, so he insists on laying down.
The 4th monkey sees the laying monkey and insists on standing tall.

After the pranksters leave the first monkey, that monkey sees the 4th monkey standing tall and insists on remaining laying on the floor.
We can summarize the situation as
* low High low High.

Later the pranksters find the second monkey standing tall, and tickle that monkey until the monkey rolls on the floor laughing.
After the pranksters leave and the dust settles, a similar but not identical situation occurs.
We summarize the new situation as
* High low High low.

What happens if the building has 6 sides? Or 100 sides?

Next the pranksters do something even more diabolical.
They place some of these monkeys at one of these &quot;modern&quot; architecture skyscrapers has 5 corners, and place 5 monkeys, one at each of the 5 corners.
While the pranksters are tickling the first monkey, we can summarize the situation as
* low High low High low
But as soon as the pranksters tire of it and wander off, the tickled monkey sees the monkey laying in front and insists on standing up:
* High High low High low.
Pretty soon the standing monkey that was watching the monkey be tickled notices that monkey is now standing up, so this standing monkey insists on laying down.
* High low low High low.
The process continues around the building
* High low High High low
* High low High low low
* High low High low High
* low low High low High
* low High High low High
* low High low low High
* low High low High High
* low High low High low
* High High low High low
* High low low High low
and so on.
Even though the pranksters have long gone,
the monkeys keep jumping up and laying down, over and over again, indefinitely.

The 5 monkeys in a ring around this building form a kind of ring oscillator.

There are a huge variety of other things we can use instead of monkeys.
Electronic inverters must be fed a little electronic power, but that costs far less than the feed for a bunch of monkeys.

There are conceptually 3 parts to a ring oscillator:
* signal restoration: when the input of one stage is even a little bit low, the output goes practically all the way High; when the input is even a little bit High, the output goes practically all the way low.
* time delay: when the input suddenly goes high-to-low, it takes a short (but non-zero) amount of time before the next stage &quot;notices&quot; and goes low-to-high.
* a feedback loop, so that the output of the final stage is seen by the first stage, the output of the first stage is seen by the second stage, and so on.

In practice, the &quot;time delay&quot; part may not be a separate physical part, but merely the inherent light-speed delay in information passing from one location to some other physical location.

&lt;u&gt;Requirements for Priests&lt;/u&gt;

This portion is written to define to the priests of Yahweh what the requirements are necessary for them to stay holy.  The interesting thing is that all these restrictions are outward.  First it gives us a series of regulations concerning Levitical priests: how they are to live, the kind of women they are to marry, how they are to stay away from dead things and consecrate themselves as holy unto Yahweh. The portion also gives a variety of sundry laws for the priests and how they are to conduct their day-to-day affairs. Who can be buried or married, what can’t be shaven or cut or marred.  Verse 17 through 23 speaks about the deformed, damaged or sick in the priestly line, and forbids their approach to present offerings.  Yahweh says these rules are established because the priests are leaders, and that they may not profane His name, the sanctuary or the consecration of the anointing oil.  

Its purpose is to enlighten us as sons of the Almighty God of Israel, of the great responsibility that we have been given to be the kingdom of priests and the holy nation that the Holy One Himself has chosen for the purpose of being a light unto the other nations.   From the beginning chapters of Vayikra/Leviticus,where the laws of Sacrifice (chs 1-7), to the inauguration of the sanctuary services (chs 8-10), to descriptions about how the priesthood was to function (chs 9-11), the laws of purity (chs 11-16) which include the dietary laws and the laws of purification, the prohibitions of unlawful marriages and sexual morals (chs 17-18), to the manual for moral instruction (chs 19-), the book has been developing a code of behavior that will literally set the children of Israel apart from all the other nations.  As the previous Torah portion was appropriately named Kedoshim or Holy Ones, the requirements for Israel is to be a holy nation.  Now He imparts further enlightenment and instructs Moses to speak even more instructions to the priests and the sons of Aaron. 

It also details some very important ordinances that help form the foundation of the Biblical society of Israel.   Since the nation of Israel is to become a “nation of Priests,’ with this requirement to be forever and without end,  then it is important for followers of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to understand the responsibility that priesthood carries.  We are in essence to be God’s representatives on earth.  It is upon our heads, because we have been given His revelation, to communicate it effectively to all the other nations so that they will to be drawn into an eternal and saving relationship with the Holy One of Israel.  Consequently, it is incumbent upon the sons of Israel to not only “talk the talk,’ but most importantly, “walk the walk. ' These expressions are useful because in this day and age, as the lines of demarcation between the children of God and the followers of the Evil One are being drawn, it is imperative that the commonwealth of Israel stand up for the Truth as embodied in the Holy Scriptures.  One of the most obvious ways we can do that is by first hearing the Word, then obeying the Word and ultimately walking it out.
  

&lt;u&gt;Leadership&lt;/u&gt;

In chapter 21 Yahweh demands higher standards of righteousness, obedience and holiness for those in leadership over his people. The higher up in leadership you desire to go the more your walk must characterize service, death to self and a holiness (See 1 Tim. 3:1-13; Tit. 1:5-9).  Standards of holiness rise as one moves closer to Yahweh.  Yeshua condemned the religious leaders of his day for not practicing what they preached (hypocrisy), for living lives of pretense and show (whited sepulchers full of bones), for greediness and pride.    The priests were given a prominent role in the service to the Temple.  With this role came many spiritual benefits that the common people did not receive.  These privileges were balanced by additional responsibility, accountability and a higher level of discipline.


&lt;u&gt;Holy Offerings&lt;/u&gt;

Leviticus  22:1-31    In this section of Torah Yahweh makes some strong delineations between that which is profane, polluted or contaminated and that which is kadosh or set-apart unto Yahweh for use in service to Him.  To come into His presence demands that men follow high and exacting standards.  This is to teach sinful man that although Yahweh is high and lifted up above the mortal and mundane plane in kadosh-ness (holiness) and righteousness,  He is not unapproachable by men who prepare themselves properly to come into His presence (Read Ecc. 5:1-2.).   He wanted to impress this upon the Israelites as they began the service of the Tabernacle.  Therefore Yahweh specifies that certain offerings brought to His altar which are contaminated will be rejected if 

(a) the offerer is in a state of physical contamination, 

(b) one is contaminated through improper marriage, 

(c) one is offering a blemished animal. 


In the Book of Hebrews we are called priests.  Yeshua is the guarantor of our priestly covenant (Heb. 7:22)  He is our High Priest, without weakness or flaw, eternal.  And under His priestly reign Paul says “Torah will be put in our minds and written in our hearts” (Heb. 8:10).   So, our calling is more than outward, (although we do have instruction in how to appear).  Our calling is deeper, it reaches the mind and the heart and calls us to honor our High Priest, to follow Him in being a servant and to move beyond outward observance of Torah to the inward life of obedience.  Not the sacrifice of animals or grains, but the sacrifice of praise, the broken and contrite heart that Yahweh can use, and the renewed mind that has wisdom from above. Thanks be to Yahweh and the Messiah Yeshua that in Luke 14 Yeshua makes clear that the deformed, the damaged and the sick will be made welcome at His feast.  We are the imperfect, made whole through His sacrifice, and we are the priests called to bring honor to His name.   

But what type offerings do we bring to Yahweh’s altar?  Our time, our money, our energy, our talents and giftings, our devotion? Do we give him the best?  Do we pray and study His Word consistently and give Him the best quality time?  Are the offerings and tithes which we give the  leftovers after other commitments are met?


&lt;u&gt;Sanctifying His Name&lt;/u&gt;

Leviticus 22:2, 32   This parasha begins and ends with Yahweh commanding His people to not desecrate His kadosh/holy name, but to sanctify or to keep it set-apart.  In Hebrew thought a name is not only one's name, but is a reflection of one's character and identity.    This is part of our worship and He requires us to not offer profane, polluted or contaminated offerings.  In Exodus 20 we find the Ten Commandments (or Words), the first word or command in the Hebrew text is prefaced by  &quot;I am Yahweh your God... &quot; then   &quot;You shall have no other gods before me...&quot;   

His character, His identity, is set before us for us to honour all that He is, to give Him the pre-eminence in all things.  Our actions and behaviour reflects on Him and affects His reputation before the world and the respect they therefore will give to Him.   If we act in a holy manner befitting children of God, His name is sanctified.   If we act in a godless or wicked manner, Yahweh’s Name and reputation is defiled.   A significant amount of ethical standards are formulated around the idea of sanctifying the Name of Yahweh.   Every choice we make in life will in someway or another reflect upon God.   Our every interaction with other human beings will in one way or another say something about the God we serve.

To sanctify God’s Name means to treat His Name with the respect, honor and consecration that He deserves.  But in the broader sense, it refers to obedience and uprightness of character.  The Torah explains that the formula for sanctifying God’s Name is obedience to the commandments. “So you shall keep My commandments, and do them; I am Yahweh.” (22:31)  The Master concurs: “Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” (Matthew 5:16)  He is saying that when we do good works, we bring glory to our Father in Heaven. Our sins rob God of the glory that He is due.   This is part of the meaning of the words the Master taught us to pray. “Sanctified be Your Name, Your Kingdom Come, Your will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven,” are all parallel statements. When God’s will is done on earth, His commandments are being kept. His reign and rule are being exercised on Earth, and His Name is then sanctified.


&lt;u&gt;Set Apart Times.&lt;/u&gt;   

The Torah declares times (Shabbat and festivals), persons (priests and Levites), objects (e.g., articles in the Tabernacle) as kadosh or set apart.  In the Torah and in traditional Judaism times are designated set-apart (23:2) through ritual, prayer or declaration.  People are declared kadosh or set apart for service through initiation involving anointing and the laying on of hands.   In our Christian culture of extreme informality, casualness and personal independence, the kind of formalities that Torah contains when it comes to recognizing set-apart people, times and places can seem foreign, awkward and unnecessary. 

Leviticus 23:1-3   “Yahweh spoke to Moshe, saying: Speak to the Children of Yisrael and say to them: Yahweh’ s appointed festivals that you are to designate as holy convocations – these are My appointed festivals.  For six days labor may be done, and the seventh day is a day of complete rest, a holy convocation, you shall not do any work: it is a Sabbath for Yahweh in all your dwelling places.&quot;

The appointed times of Yahweh in this chapter are the weekly Sabbath/Shabbat (v.  3), Passover (v.  5), Unleavened Bread(vs.  6-8), First Fruits (vs.  9-14), Pentecost/Shavuot(vs'.  15-22), Trumpets (vs.  23-25), Day of Atonement (vs.  26-32),Tabernacles (vs. 33-43), and the Eighth Day Assembly/Shemini Atzeret (v'.  36b). 

On these appointed feasts, Yahweh calls his people together to have a special meeting with them. In these appointed feasts, He has decided to reveal his entire Messianic, prophetic program for the redemption of man and creation. 

All these feasts that Yahweh has established are prophetic pictures of what is going to happen in the future.  They are said to be &quot;holy convocations&quot;.  They are intended to be times of assembling and gathering together.  The word used for 'convocation' is mikra and means 'a rehearsal' .  Rehearsing something enables you to get it right for the main event.  Now, if these feasts are rehearsals for something greater that will be in the coming age, what will happen to those who did not want to take part in the rehearsals.

In the Apostolic Scriptures, Colossians 2:17 tells us that the substance of these times belongs to Messiah, meaning that in addition to the ancient meaning for honoring these days, which is the shadow, there is yet more fulfillment yet to come.   In Yeshua, we know these appointments mean much more than what they were originally established for.  They are a &quot;shadow of what is to come.&quot;    These verses do not say that we should not celebrate these things, but rather the opposite. They say that we should not allow anyone to judge us in the way that we keep them. The shadow is cast by the real object and these shadows help us to have a deeper understanding of the true picture which is the redemptive work of the Messiah.  Even when the true object which casts the shadow is present you cannot remove the shadow.  These shadows are still pointing to something that is to come in the future. So, when we celebrate these feasts, we rehearse and prepare for what is coming.

The weekly Shabbat heads the list of the ‘kadosh’, set apart, appointed times and is called a “set-apart convocation” (Heb. miqra, Strong’s H#4744) or assembly, calling together, convocation.  Obviously, Yahweh takes the weekly Shabbat very seriously.   Intimacy with Yahweh demands personal holiness in heart, mind and action (walking it out).  Holiness as He sees it, demands recognizing His set apart times.  This is part of His statutes which if we honour we shall be blessed. By honoring the weekly Sabbath, we not only have a complete day of physical rest, but we also rest in Messiah by devoting  the day to Him and to meditating on His Word. 

The Children of Yisrael were provided for during the forty years in the wilderness, by the double portion supply of manna for each weekly Shabbat. Yahweh knew that if men and women everywhere would recognize His Sabbath day, they would attribute creation of the universe to Him and by so acknowledging this truth would look to Him as their source of supply.  For this reason He said to them   “Speak to the Children of Yisrael saying, Verily my Sabbaths you shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am Yahweh that does sanctify you”     Exodus 31:13.

It is a sign that we are in covenant relationship with Yahweh and are prepared to be separated from the rest of the world.    We establish our identity by obedience in keeping His commands.

The Feast Days are arranged in chronological order and relate to one’s spiritual walk and development.  They contain the plan of salvation and/or the steps man must go through in being reconciled to our Creator God.  These Sabbath festivals were also known as High Holy Sabbaths, in which no work is done. They are observed differently from the weekly Sabbaths as they were meant to reinforce our spiritual goals and to inspire us to achieve a more committed walk of sanctification. As a result our walk of intimacy with our Heavenly Father will grow and so will our level of spiritual understanding of His ways and purposes for our lives.

At Passover we not only remember the Ancient Israelites exodus from Ancient Egypt, but we also remember the exodus that we have from bondage to sin into new life through Yeshua, Who is our blameless Passover Lamb and blood covering.  We eat matzah for eight days during Unleavened Bread not only to remember how the Israelites had to flee Egypt in haste, but also we recognize that Yeshua is the Bread of Life, leavenless or sinless.
  
At First Fruits we not only commemorate the early harvest, but we recognize that Messiah is the First Fruits risen from the dead and rejoice in the finished work of the Atonement.   This teaches us that Yeshua's resurrection is the foundation for others to be able to take part in the resurrection power, which is symbolized by the grain that comes up out of the earth, as it is written in 1 Corinthians 15:35-44

At Pentecost we are not only reminded of the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai to Moses and the 3,000 Israelites who were killed for their idolatry, but we also remember that the Holy Spirit was poured out in the Upper Room and 3,000 were saved.  In the Fall we celebrate the Feast of Trumpets or Yom Teruah, representing the holy convocation of the Israelites and the future gathering of the saints into the clouds to meet Yeshua as He returns to judge Planet Earth after the Tribulation period.  

On the Day of the Atonement we fast and afflict ourselves, as it was the day where the high priest would atone for the sin of the nation and there would be national mourning, representative of the time when Messiah will return to judge the nations at His Second Coming - a time when there will be worldwide morning as God''s wrath is poured out. 

At Tabernacles we remember our ancestors'' trek through the wilderness which represents our Father's desire to want to tabernacle or dwell with us - the primary theme of the coming Millennial reign and restored Kingdom of Israel on Earth'.  Furthermore, Tabernacles is the probable time when Yeshua was born in Bethlehem. 
And what of the weekly Sabbath?   We devote the seventh day completely unto God and it represents the coming Sabbath Millennium where Yeshua will reign supreme and all will be at rest.
 

&lt;u&gt;Love in Works and Truth&lt;/u&gt;

Love is as a verb, it is a word of action.  One who is in love actively pursues their lover.  One who is in love cherishes, holds dear, and actively desires to express their passion and devotion to their lover and do those things which please the one they love.  

&quot;Hereby we do know that we know Him, if we keep His Commandments. He that says, I know Him, and keeps not His Commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whosoever keeps His word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in Him.&quot;   I John 1:3-5

&quot;My little Children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him.&quot; 
&quot;And whatsoever we ask we receive of Him, because we keep His Commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.&quot;     I John 3:18-19

&quot;You worship you know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Yehudim (Jew). But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship Him. Yahweh our God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.&quot;   John 4:22-24

      <text xml:space="preserve">BEHAR / On the Mount
Leviticus 25:1 to 26:2;   Jeremiah 32:6-27

Behar, ‘On the Mount,’  has some very intriguing commandments in it, most  of which can only be performed in the Land of Israel.  When we review the history of the Ancient Israelites, they did not honor these commandments very well. 

This Torah portion also details various commands related to the jubilee year.   Yahweh tells us that the Land is to have a sabbatical rest every forty-nine years, with a jubilee year proclaimed on Yom Kippur.  During this jubilee year, there is to be no farming and the Land is to remain fallow.  It discusses the law of redemption and the appropriate return of property to its original owners, regulations relating to proper treatment of slaves and servants, and the redeeming of a poor man.  The parashah ends with Yahweh telling us that we will be blessed if we obey Him. 


&lt;u&gt;The Sabbath Cycles - The Shemitta&lt;/u&gt;

Leviticus 25:1-6
“And Yahweh spake unto Moshe in Mt. Sinai, saying, Speak unto the Children of Yisrael, and say unto them, When you come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a Sabbath unto Yahweh. Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof. But in the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the land, a Sabbath for Yahweh: you shall neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard. That which grows of its own accord of your harvest you shall not reap, neither gather the grapes of your vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land. And the Sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for you, and for your servant, and for your maid, and for your hired servant, and for your stranger that sojourns with you.”

The Sabbatical/Shemitah (7-year) cycle and Jubilee (50-year ‘Yovel’) year are based on the number “seven.”  The Sabbatical/Shemitah (7 year cycle) parallels the seven days of creation and the Sabbath day.   The number seven in the bible is the number given for perfection and completion.  The number seven represents the cycle of completion in the creation.  Thus the seven cycles of seven years lead up to Yovel/Jubilee and represents the perfection of perfections - i.e. the ultimate perfection.The Stone Edition Chumash, translates 25:2(b) as follows, “When you come into the land that I give you the land shall observe a Sabbath rest for Yahweh.”    Though the rabbis say this does not imply that Yahweh rests, it acknowledges the fact that as Yahweh “rested” after His creation of the world, so too, Israel rested in the seventh year from its agricultural work on the seventh year to commemorate His act of creation (Artscroll Rashi Leviticus, p. 318). 

His instructions of not sowing or reaping in the seventh year with the promise that He would send great blessing in the year preceding it so that they would have sufficient until the next crop in the new cycle, was a test of faith and of their willingness to be obedient to His commandment and give the land its rest and enter into the cycle of rest that He had planned for them also.

The prohibition only applies to agricultural and gardening work. The only thing that is permitted is watering the plants so that they will not die. During the Shabbat Year, the produce of the ground is without owner, so anyone may eat freely and bring home as much as needed for the day.  For the poor, the seventh year of rest in the land was to provide a source of food for them.  The owners of the field were not to harvest that which grew of its own accord or to prune  or similarly to tend their vines or trees.   During this year everyone, Israelite as well as resident Gentiles, had equal rights to eat of what grew on the ground.

The Sabbath of the land teaches that our means of producing an income belongs entirely to Yahweh.  He gives us life, breath, land, health, eyesight, physical and mental abilities...everything that we need to survive.   All belongs to Yahweh and He gives us everything we need with which to work our land, do our job, raise our family, educate ourselves, etc.  We need to be constantly aware that the systems of this world are under the government of the ‘god of this world’ and are designed to draw men into captivity to the lusts of the flesh, being self-sufficient, and into a mind-set of determining their own destiny.

The Babylonian economic and political systems grip our world today and form the structure of our society.   Babylon is to be destroyed with all its merchandise.    See Revelation Chapters 18 and 19. If our hearts are bound up in the things of this world and our present cultural system, then we are still part of the system that will come under His judgement.  What He established in Israel is His pattern for the Kingdom Age.  We are to live in this world as strangers just passing through on our journey to our final destination.  We are merely sojourners and pilgrims here as was Abraham and all those who have gone before us.


&lt;u&gt;The 'Yovel' - the Jubilee&lt;/u&gt; 
   
Vayikra/Leviticus25:8-10
‘You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years, so that you have the time of the sevens sabbaths of years, namely, forty-nine years.  You shall then sound a ram’s horn abroad on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall sound a horn all through your land.  You shall thus consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to all its inhabitants.  It shall be a Jubilee for you, and each of you shall return to his own property, and each of you shall return to his family.’     

The comparison between the Jubilee and the Sabbath is that both bear testimony to Yahweh’s creation of the universe in six days and His rest on the seventh.  They further note that the seven years of the Shemittah cycle allude to the six thousand years of history that will be climaxed by the seventh millennium, which will be a period of peace and tranquility. 	(Artscroll Stone Edition Chumash, p. 697).  

Note how everything ancient Israel did in their day-to-day life brought them into worshipful relationship with their Creator by causing them to recall both what he had done for them (past tense) and what he would do for them prophetically (future tense). We also should follow this example and forge every aspect of our life into a never-ending recognition and praise of Yahweh’s past,  present and future grace and love for us.

The Sabbaths of the land forced the Israelites to depend totally on Yahweh to bless them triple-fold on the sixth year so that they would have enough food to last on the seventh year as well as during year one again while awaiting the harvest of that year's crops.  We need to have that kind of faith to trust Yahweh implicitly for our provisions.  Think back of the ways and times He has supernaturally provided for you and your family when you thought there was no way through.

These laws concerning the land Sabbaths were a glorious opportunity to learn trust and to demonstrate their faith in Yahweh to bless them abundantly on the sixth year and see His miraculous provision, thereby strengthening their faith and receiving even more blessings from Him the next time, which resulted in them coming progressively to even higher levels of faith.

The Rabbis generally understood this word Yovel, to mean the 'ram's horn'.  However it also carries the meaning of &quot;set out&quot; and &quot;freedom of movement&quot;.  It is also synonymous with a river to which the roots of a tree planted by the river's edge will grow.   &quot;This gives it the sense of a return to roots, meaning thereby that all the fields return to their original owners and each generation goes back to it's original status.&quot;  (Munk Op. cit. 301)

The Yovel or the Jubilee Year was not only for the land, but for its people Yisrael.  If the Children of Yisrael today as well as then would have allowed Yahweh’ divine providence to influence their lives, the corruption of society through murder, thievery, and every imaginable scandal could have been averted.  The land is a divine gift from Yahweh.  For everything is His; the earth belongs to Yahweh and the people that dwell therein for He has founded them both.

The ownership of the land reverts to its original owners during Yovel.  To attempt to sell the land permanently is a violation of this commandment, and particularly to a non-Israelite who does not observe these commandments.

Prophetically, this symbolises the year of release from all bondage, all captivity and enslavement, when everything in creation goes back to it's original condition of purity and righteousness.    For this the whole creation travails and groans to be released from its burden of corruption that resulted from the defilement of sin.  Romans 8:22

Torah mentions in this parasha that the shofar should be blown on the tenth day of the seventh month which is Yom Kippur/Day of Atonement to announce the year of Yovel. Then it says that the year ought to be consecrated and proclaimed as a year of liberty.This blast of the shofar was called the shofar hagadol/the great or final shofar blast (to be distinguished from the first and second shofar blasts which occurred on the feasts of Shavuot/Pentecost and Yom Teruah/Feast of Trumpets respectively.  This same event prophetically corresponds with the return of the exiles (the &quot;lost ten tribes&quot;) to the land of Israel (which is an aspect of what the rabbis call the &quot;Final Redemption&quot;) and the return of Yeshua the Messiah. 

Messiah will come back to place his feet on the earth on Yom Kippur. When he comes back, new liberty will be proclaimed to all the inhabitants of the earth. This also teaches us that the foundation we have for eternal liberty is in the Messiah's death, which is symbolized by the Yom Kippur sacrifices, as well as in the forgiveness and obliteration of sins as a direct result of his death.


&lt;u&gt;Walking As Pilgrims and Sojourners in the Land&lt;/u&gt;

As we approach the end of the book of sanctity of Vayikra, we find that the Torah turns to the subject of fair and just relations between man and man.  We are taught to effect justice in commerce, not to lend money with interest, not to maltreat a fellow believer who has sold himself into slavery, and to redeem a field that had been sold due to dire poverty. A lthough the book of Leviticus/Vayikra treats matters of great holiness, the Torah wishes to communicate that the proof of holiness is demonstrated when morality prevails over self-interest in financial matters.  Along these lines, the Torah prohibits wronging one another (ona’ah):   And if you sell anything to your fellow or buy anything from your fellow’s hand, you shall not wrong (AL TONU) one another (Leviticus/Vayikra 25:14)

This means that, whether there is a transaction of land or movable property, both the buyer and seller are prohibited from defrauding or overcharging.  A profit of up to one-sixth is permissible; with movable property, if the profit is more than one-sixth the sale can be nullified, and if it is exactly one sixth, the profit is returned and the sale remains valid.  Even with landed property, there is a prohibition against ona’ah, although the sale is still valid.

In verse 17 the text says &quot;you shall not oppress one another&quot;.   This means to 'treat abusively' and prohibits wronging another by means of words, not to vex his fellow, nor to offer him inappropriate advice, according to the way and the pleasure of the advisor. In other words, not for personal gain.
The Rabbis understand that the Torah here is teaching against any form of maltreatment, even when no monetary gain is involved, such as verbal abuse or misleading someone.   In any case both applications of ona’ah have one thing in common: pressing one’s advantage to the detriment of another.

The fear of Yahweh is what prevents people from wronging one another.  First of all, one who fears God knows that every person is created in His image to be like Him. Therefore he ought to be respected, regardless of his lifestyle. Just because he is a person, he ought to be respected. Deceiving anyone financially or tormenting anyone verbally is not permitted.  One who deceive and oppresses his fellow man is hurting Yahweh.  Therefore, fear of God will cause people to treat others with respect and love.

When His people live in the light of the knowledge that they are but passing through this life and all that they have and use upon this earth is but leased to them, they do not claim ownership of goods and property.  In this mindset, all are but passing through this life on a pilgrim journey, partaking of the generosity of the true Owner of all things.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bechukotai 	The Gospel in Leviticus
Vayikra (Leviticus) 26:3-27:34 | Yirmeyahu (Jeremiah) 16:19-17:14

This week’s Torah teaching introduces one of the central aspects of the covenant made through Moshe of obedience to His statutes. The Torah clearly teaches here in this parashah that blessing is predicated upon obedience to its chukkim (laws). 

The word chuk (“statute” or “decree”), which gives the Parshah of Bechukotai its name, literally means “engraved”.
The Torah comes in two forms: written and engraved.   On the last day of his life, Moses inscribed the Torah on parchment scrolls.  But this written Torah was preceded by an engraved Torah: the Divine law was first given to us encapsulated in the Ten Commandments, which were etched by the hand of God in two tablets of stone.
By the Holy Spirit - the Ruach ha Chodesh we now have the Torah engraved in our being as well as having the written Word.

Because the Torah is written on the hearts of all who truly name the name of Yeshua as Lord and Savior, it is meant to be followed to the best of our ability.   We have no reason for fear of condemnation, or the trappings of legalism!	(Deuteronomy 10:12-22; Jeremiah 31:33; Ezekiel 36:25-27; Romans 7:22; 8:1; Hebrews 8:10)

We enter into the blessing of His life through faith, but we maintain His life within through not grieving His Spirit, that is, by keeping His precepts.  Thus we maintain fellowship with Him and do not allow ourselves to become separated from Him by disobedience.

Covenants require a response on the part of the follower. Yahweh, for His part, has provided the “promise of inheritance” for all those who participate in the Abrahamic Covenant.  The response to this covenant is “faith”.  The nature of the Mosaic Covenant is “blessing, maintenance, and enjoyment of promise” on the basis of “obedience”. 
 

&lt;u&gt;If you walk in My statutes&lt;/u&gt; (Leviticus 26:3)

If you will walk in My statutes and keep My commandments and perform them; then I will provide your rains in their time, and the land will give its produce and the tree of the field will give its fruit.  Your threshing will last until the vintage, and the vintage will last until the sowing; you will eat your bread to satiety and you will dwell securely in your land.  I will provide peace in the land, and you will lie down with none to frighten you: I will cause wild beasts to withdraw from the land, and a sword will not cross your land.  You will pursue your enemies; and they will fall before you by the sword.  Five of you will pursue a hundred, and a hundred of you will pursue ten thousand; and your enemies will fall before you by the sword. I will turn My attention to you, I will make you fruitful and increase you; and I will establish My covenant with you.  You will eat very old grain and remove the old to make way for the new.  I will place My Sanctuary among you; and My Spirit will not reject you.  I will walk among you, I will be God unto you and you will be a people unto Me.

The word &quot;if&quot; is understood as a plea on the part of God: &quot;If only you would follow My statutes.. .. &quot;(Talmud, Avodah Zarah 5a)

As a loving Father Who desires our good, His heart longs that we might choose to do what is right that He might not have to chastise us to bring us into the path of life.   He would  rather shower us with blessings than use corrective punishment upon us. These punishments here are temporal and meant to be corrective.   When a child trespasses and breaks the family covenant, he is not excluded from the family, but disciplined with the intent that he will learn and grow from the experience. So it is with our heavenly Father - His love is unconditional but not without corrective chastisement.  It is meant to correct us.

In verse 23 Yahweh warns them about behaving 'casually' with Him - an attitude of familiarity that breeds contempt for His instructions.    In the Targum Onkelos the word is interpreted with the meaning of 'witholding' - that is withholding obedience from a heart that is hardened.   This speaks of wilful disobedience and disregard for His instructions to us - going one's own way.
It is the attitude expressed by the actions rather than the behaviour itself.


&lt;u&gt;The Curse of the Law&lt;/u&gt;

From a New Covenant perspective, some teach that all of the curses of the law have been removed in Messiah.  It is a common teaching, based on Galatians that, “Messiah redeemed us from the curse of the Torah.” (Galatians 3:13). This seems to indicate that in Messiah, the curses are removed, but the blessings remain   --  ?
“The curse of the law” spoken of in Galatians 3:13 is not the curses for disobedience listed out in Leviticus 26 or Deuteronomy 28.  The “curse of the law” in Galatians is the end result of the spiritual condition of being separated from God which is death  -  the judgement upon man’s sinful state which is eternal separation from God.   This is different from the curses which come from acts of disobedience of a redeemed community or a person who are in covenant relationship with Yahweh. 

According to Paul, “The curse of the Torah/Law” is condemnation in the eternal court of judgment.   This is the curse of condemnation and death that was unleashed upon Messiah on the torture stake when He took the penalty of sin upon Himself so that all who accepted His atonement would be delivered from its consequences.  It is this condemnation from which we have been redeemed and which has been nailed to His cross.     (Colossians 2:14)
The “certificate of debt” which has been taken out of the way and nailed to the cross is the judgement of eternal death.   This is the ultimate curse of the Torah/Law.   It is this curse which Messiah took upon Himself in becoming “a curse for us.” (Gal. 3:13)

Therefore it is incorrect to suppose that there are no longer any consequences for sin.   The ultimate consequence of condemnation has been removed — nailed to the cross.  But the laws of cause and effect are still very much at work.  Sin still reaps punishment.  Obedience to God still results in blessing.   (Romans 4:15, 5:18–20, 7:25–8:1, 1 Corinthians 3:9)


&lt;u&gt;Blessing and the Curse&lt;/u&gt;

It is interesting that the rewards for keeping His commandments are returned in the physical realm of life to give us abundance in the things which we need for livelihood.   Whereas the absence of His blessings cause us to labour under the heaviness of our existence when things don’t go well for us, with the intent that it will be corrective and that we will turn our hearts toward Him again seeking His deliverance from the result of our errant ways.
The blessings of obedience are an encouragement to continue in the bond of the covenant in relationship with Him and the curses which we reap from eating the fruit of our own ways are meant to keep us from going on unchecked in our rebellious lifestyle.   

After the blessings comes the “rebuke” or “punishment”  --a harshly detailed prediction of what will befall the people of Israel when they turn away from God.   His reproof to them, found in chapter 26:14-45, is in Hebrew the “Tochacha”, a “minor” listing of “curses” brought against the People for their disobedience.  A similar yet “major” listing, also referred to as “Tochacha”, can be read in Parashat Ki Tavo at D’varim (Deuteronomy) chapter 28.

The Hebrew word tochacha means reproof, correction, scolding, reprimand, punishment, etc.  By its context it conveys the purpose of “divine retribution”.   Interesting by comparison, the Hebrew of this current chapter is written in the plural, addressing collective Isra’el.  Its counterpart in Dvarim 28, however, is written in the singular.

There are three things which are listed here specifically as a mandate for the blessings to follow and they are - 
“You shall not make idols for yourselves .. .. .. “
“You shall keep My Sabbaths and reverence My Sanctuary .. .. .. “

These are the priorities of worship - of loving Him with all our mind, heart, soul and strength   -  which if we do,  He says,
# “I will give you the rain in its season  “   ..  
# the land shall yield its produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
# Your threshing shall last till the time of vintage ..  ..   (no shortage of supply)
# you shall eat your bread to the full ..  ..   ..   (full satisfaction and nourishment from what you eat)
# and dwell in your land safely.  I will give peace in the land.”
# I will rid the land of evil beasts, and the sword will not go through your land.”  (3-13)
# He gives promises of power over our enemies, to overcome them  (v.7-8)  And most importantly,  
# “I will look on You favourably and make you fruitful, multiply you and confirm My covenant with you&quot;

Yahweh says that He will ‘confirm’ or ‘maintain’ the covenant, or more correctly translated, “I will cause My covenant to stand”.    In other words He will cause the promises of the covenant  to stand.   
“I will set My Tabernacle among you,    ..   ..  ..   I will walk among you and be your God, and you shall be My people.” (v.11-12)

His literal Presence with them was part of His covenant with them at Sinai.   
He said, “My Presence will go with you” into the land (Exodus 33:14),  and in the land His Tabernacle was set up as  a permanent dwelling place among them.    So it continued with them while they kept His covenant.


&lt;u&gt;The Basis of the Blessings and the Curses&lt;/u&gt;

Before commencing the blessings, Yahweh states: “If you walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments and do them .. .. “  The blessings were conditional.  (26:3 )
Before the curses the He states:   “But if you will not hearken to Me, and will not do all these commands .. .. “ 26:14
“And if you shall despise, or if your soul abhor My judgments, so that you will not do all My commandments, but that you break My Covenant.” 26:15   The standards applied to the blessings evidently differ from those relating to the curses.
Thus, the curses are not to be administered upon the mere transgression of the laws (space is given to repent); only upon despising and abhorring them, as noted by Seforno:   If you shall despise My statutes  beyond mere violation, you will despise them;
And if your soul loathe My judgments consciously  i.e., loathe them as one might willfully spew out something that is objectionable.”     

Thus the preconditions of the blessings radically differ from those of the curses. The understanding is that it is the rejecting of His commandments that brings the curse, not the failure to keep them by one whose heart is toward Him and who fails through the weakness of the flesh.

These statutes are defined for the corporate body of Israel (all twelve tribes including those who join themselves to greater Israel) from its founder, the author and finisher of our faith, Yahweh.  These statutes stand as eternal decrees, permanent rules, which were not annulled at Calvary.  These statutes are also considered (the laws) or instructions enacted by our legislative branch of divine government through Yahweh.  Throughout the discourse of this study, we see that blessings are given to those who observe His statutes in obedience, but to those who are given to disobedience, we see punishment.  Even in the natural, there is a consequence to disobeying the laws and instructions which govern a unified community of people formed into an association such as a society or nation. 

Yahweh assures us that if we obey His statutes, we will be so busy with prosperity that we will still be busy threshing grain when the time comes to harvest our grapes and even then we will still be occupied when it comes time to sow the next year.  Even the very old grain, the stored crops from previous years, will remain fresh and even improve with age so that the old grain will be superior to the new.  And when the new crops come in, new storage houses will need to be built to make room for the new crop. These passages of scripture are rich with the fullness of being close to Yahweh’ heart, however, it does come at a price to us.  The cost for Yahweh’ favored hand of blessings will require us to be obedient and faithful to His statutes.  However, if we choose our way above His, we will face a series of punishments.

:The first series of punishments:

But if you will not listen to Me and will not perform all of these commandments; if you consider My decrees loathsome, and if your being rejects My ordinances, so as not to perform all My commandments, so that you annul My covenant – then I will do the same to you; I will assign upon you panic, swelling lesions, and burning fever, which cause eyes to long and souls to suffer; you will sow your seeds in vain, for your enemies will eat it.  I will turn My attention against you, you will be struck down before enemies; those who hate you will subjugate you – you will flee with no one pursuing you.

:The second series of punishments:

If despite this you do not heed Me, then I shall punish you further, seven times more for your sins.  I will break the pride of your might; I will make your heaven like iron and your land like copper.  Your strength will be spent in vain; your land will not give its produce and the tree of the land will not give its fruit.

:The third series of punishments:

If you behave casually with Me and refuse to heed Me, then I shall lay a further blow upon you – seven times like your sins.  I will incite the wildlife of the field against you and it will leave you bereft of your children, decimate your livestock, and diminish you; and your roads will become desolate.

:The fourth series of punishments:

If despite these you will not be chastised toward Me, and you behave casually with Me, then I, too, will behave toward you with casualness; and I will strike you, even I, seven times for your sins.  I will bring upon you a sword, avenging the vengeance of a covenant, you will be gathered into your cities; then I will send a pestilence among you and you will be delivered into the hand of your enemy.  When I break for you the staff of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one oven, and they will bring back your bread by weight; you will eat and not be sated. 

:The fifth series of punishments:

If despite this you will not heed Me, and you behave toward Me with casualness, I will behave toward you with a fury of casualness; I will chastise you, even I, seven times for your sins.  You will eat the flesh of your sons; and the flesh of your daughters will you eat.  I will destroy your lofty buildings and decimate your sun-idols, I will cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols, and My Spirit will reject you.  I will lay your cities in ruin and I will make your sanctuaries desolate; I will not savor your satisfying aromas.  I will make the land desolate; and your foes who dwell upon it will be desolate. And you, I will scatter among the nations, I will unsheathe the sword after you, your land will be desolate and your cities will be a ruin.

There is an increasing severity in the punishments meted out, but this is not vengeance in operation but a greater measure of discipline required by the stiff-neckedness of the rebellious and their failure to repent in the previous lighter measures of judgement which required Him to exert greater pressure upon them.

Because of Israel’s disobedience and failure to observe the commandment of keeping the Sabbatical years, they were exiled from the land into Babylon for seventy years.  During that time, the land made up for the rest in which it had been deprived.  Israelities, Judah and Ephraim, have been scattered throughout the nations of the world, and were cut off from one another.


&lt;u&gt;Faith and Obedience to Yahweh&lt;/u&gt;

The keeping of Yahweh’s principles does not cause one to inherit eternal life - you cannot earn spiritual blessings.  It is only by faith that you enter into His life (which is an eternal spiritual quality of life) and not by any works of righteousness that you do - you cannot earn salvation.
But as a result of inheriting His life and becoming a recipient of it, Yahweh’s expectation is that you will walk in His precepts.

If we are to ever experience the heights and depths of a real relationship with Yahweh, it will require not only our faith but that of works.  Faith without works is dead.  If we say we love Yahweh and keep not His commandments, then we are a lie and the truth is not in us.  For love is a word of action and requires work to show forth your affection and love.  If we are in love with someone, it requires faithfulness to that person.  So then did our faith in Yeshua at Calvary annul the commandments of Yahweh?  May it never be!  What our faith in fact does is establish a unique and personal relationship with our Messiah Yeshua and Yahweh. Our faith in Yeshua does not lessen our commitment to Yahweh’ instructions and statutes, but in effect establishes and brings about a synthesis of love and obedience to His statutes, and a desire to never wander far from His divine presence ever again.  

Because the Messiah has already come, the Torah is now a document meant to be lived out in the life of a faithful follower of Yeshua, through the power of the Ruach HaKodesh, to the glory of the Father.  It should not be presumed that it can be obeyed in one’s own strength, automatically or legalistically, without having the faith and trust in the empowering of His life within.  Nor can it be performed mechanically without having a motivation of love for Yahweh and for others.  Torah observance is a matter of the heart, always has been, and always will be.

This idea of commandment-keeping is a state of mind, as well as a daily function!  We should never fall for the age-old, compulsory reasons for keeping the commands of Yahweh for being accepted by Him! 

It is not something we do to become saved; it is something we do because we are saved!    It is the result from having the Torah placed in our inward parts, as new creations in Messiah Yeshua,  giving us a new nature that desires to obey Him!

      <comment>moved [[User talk:I-20/rollback.js]] to [[User talk:Frozen Wind/rollback.js]]: Automatically moved page while renaming the user &quot;[[User:I-20|I-20]]&quot; to &quot;[[User:Frozen Wind|Frozen Wind]]&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">;Usage

To install [[User:I-20/rollback.js]], add the following to [[Special:Mypage/monobook.js]] as a logged-in user using the monobook skin:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
importScript('User:I-20/rollback.js');
&lt;/source&gt;

On diff pages, history pages, user contribution pages, recent changes, and personal watchlists, a &quot;sum&quot; link will appear next to the &quot;rollback&quot; link. When you click on &quot;sum&quot;, you will be prompted to enter a summary. Press Cancel to cancel, or leave a blank summary to use the default. In the summary, the text &quot;$user&quot; will automatically be replaced with the user name you're reverting. e.g., &quot;&lt;tt&gt;rv edits by $user; not true&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. Then press OK to submit.

;Extra options

To disable the link from appearing on any one of the pages, add a line containing a list after the &quot;importScript&quot; statement. The options are 'diff', 'history', 'user', 'recent', and 'watchlist'. For example, to disable the link on history pages and user contribution pages:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
rollbackLinksDisable = [ 'history', 'user' ]
&lt;/source&gt;

In addition, there is an option to have default text in the summary pop-up instead of a blank text field. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
rollbackSummaryDefault = &quot;[[WP:RBK|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/$2|$2]] ([[User talk:$2|talk]]) to last version by $1&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

;Finally
None of the above affects how rollback is done if you use the 'rollback' link instead of the 'sum' link. Please contact if there are any problems :) [[User:Gracenotes|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#960;&quot;&gt;Grace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000;&quot;&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Gracenotes|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#960;&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;span title=&quot;User talk:Gracenotes/rollback.js&quot;&gt;§&lt;/span&gt;

Contents

Introduction

Model gliders made out of paper and rubber powered planes fascinating toys. This book will describe how to build and fly these. 


'''Part 1: Gliders from Paper'''

The first step is to build a simple paper glider such as the one shown. Cut the tabs at the back of the wing as shown in the diagram. These will be used to trim the paper plane, that is to adjust the wings so that the plane will fly level.

Why won't the paper plane fly straight without any adjustments? Just like its real life counterparts, the model plane may have inaccuracies in its construction- we call this the air frame, and will need to be trimmed, that is, adjusted in flight to make it fly correctly. For most single engined propeller planes, however, adjustments need to be made to counteract the effect of the slipstream from the propeller, different forces being felt at different speeds and power settings, as well as adjusting the plane so that it does not climb or dive. 

Launch the paper plane holding it level. In the case of my paper plane...

      <text xml:space="preserve">1. Which of the following definitions are functions and which are relations:

:a. &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x + 2&lt;/math&gt; = '''Function'''
:b. &lt;math&gt;g(x) = x - 2&lt;/math&gt; = '''Function'''
:c. &lt;math&gt;h(x) = x * 2&lt;/math&gt; = '''Function'''
:d. &lt;math&gt;i(x) = x / 2&lt;/math&gt; = '''Function'''

2. Which of the following definitions are functions and which are relations:

:a. &lt;math&gt;j(x) = x + x&lt;/math&gt; = '''Function''' Same as x * 2.
:b. &lt;math&gt;k(x) = x - x&lt;/math&gt; = '''Relation'''
:c. &lt;math&gt;l(x) = x * x&lt;/math&gt; = '''Relation'''
:d. &lt;math&gt;m(x) = x / x&lt;/math&gt; = '''Relation'''

3. Can you write descriptions of the functions in problems 1 and 2? What is the difference?

The functions in exercise 1 use a variable and a constant.  The function and relationships in exercise 2 depend on the value of the variable x.  In exercise 1 the functions are guaranteed to be unique because x is changed in a consistent way.  In question 2 the last three functions are relations because the function value can re-occur.  K(x) is a relation because for any value of x the answer will always be 0, l(x) is a relation because it has the the same values for positive and negative values of x, and m(x) has two values: either 1 or -1 and is undefined at 0.  When we evaluate the relationships of the variables in terms of themselves we begin to explore the functionality of the operators.  &lt;math&gt;x + x&lt;/math&gt; shows the relationship between addition and multiplication.  &lt;math&gt; x * x&lt;/math&gt; shows a similar relationship between multiplication and exponentiation.  (Is &lt;math&gt;n(x) = x * x * x &lt;/math&gt; a function or a relation?)   &lt;math&gt;x - x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x / x&lt;/math&gt; show the identity property of subtraction and division respectively.  (What are the identity properties of addition and multiplication?  Are these functions or relationships?)

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:20.0pt'&gt;Basic Irony Tutorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;In this tutorial I will be going through the steps to
create a basic language called “GridWorld” Syntax. Keep
in mind: First, this tutorial was not intended to provide exhaustive knowledge
of the Irony tool, and second, that use of the sample projects in the Irony
download is strongly recommended. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:20.0pt'&gt;Chapter 1 -- GridWorld&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:16.0pt'&gt;I. Introduction to GridWorld&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;We will start off by creating a simple language that
describes a grid of certain height and width, starts at some location within
the grid, and move around within the grid. So here is some possible source code
for the GridWorld language:&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Create a 10 by 10 grid.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Start at location 1,1.&lt;span style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;(1)&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Move down 3.&lt;span style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;(2)&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Move right 3. &lt;span style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;(3)&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Move up 1.&lt;span style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-tab-count:1'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;(4)&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;And here is the result, assuming (0,0) is of the form
(row, column) and is the top left most square:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;You might have already reasoned that it wouldn’t be too
difficult to tackle this problem without use of any parsing tool at all. The
first two lines of our language will always be the same in every program that
we make, with different numbers in place of “10 by 10” and “1,1”, and the next
few lines are quite repetitive. Perhaps the program would become more complex
if the coder was assigned to &lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;validate the
syntax&lt;/i&gt; of this toy language. Even still, in this case it would be a
relatively easy task. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;However, consider writing the same program for a much
more complex language such as Python or C#--a primitive approach from scratch,
though not impossible, would take a lot of time. Irony offers a robust method
to parse language structure. This GridWorld toy problem is a simple basis on
which to learn how to tackle much more complex grammars in the future.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:16.0pt'&gt;II. Creating a GridWorld Grammar
class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;The first step in attacking this problem with Irony is to
create a Grammar class. This class will act like a generalizing schema to parse
source code. First, we’ll need to get the Irony library.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l3 level1 lfo3'&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri'&gt;&lt;span style='mso-list:Ignore'&gt;1.&lt;span 
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Download
Irony. Go to http://irony.codeplex.com/ and get the latest version. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l3 level1 lfo3'&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri'&gt;&lt;span style='mso-list:Ignore'&gt;2.&lt;span 
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Open
the main project and build it in Visual Studio. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l3 level1 lfo3'&gt;&lt;span 
style='mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri'&gt;&lt;span style='mso-list:Ignore'&gt;3.&lt;span 
style='font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This
should generate Irony.dll in “irony-XXXX/Irony/bin/Debug”&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:.5in'&gt;Add Irony.dll to your project.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Now, create a class that extends Irony.Grammar&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:blue;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;using&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;Irony&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:
red'&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;Parsing&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;span style='color:blue'&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:blue;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:blue;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:navy'&gt;GridWorldGrammar&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;Grammar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:.5in'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:blue;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;GridWorldGrammar&lt;/span&gt;()
{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;One option we have at this point is to use case
sensitivity. The Grammar class has a constructor that takes a bool to define
this characteristic, so we could have used the following to support phrases
such as “moVE RigHT 1” (by default, the grammar &lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; case sensitive):&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:.5in'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:blue;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;GridWorldGrammar&lt;/span&gt;()
: &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;)
{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;In this class, we define the rules of the GridWorld
language in BNF. Our language structure has 3 parts to it: the create
statement, the start statement, and one or more move statements. We’ll call the
entity that contains all three of these parts the &lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'&gt;&lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;program&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The &lt;b 
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;createStatment
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;is defined with the words “Create” and “a” followed by a number, “by”,
another number, “grid” and a period. A &lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i 
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;moveStatement &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;contains a &lt;b 
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;direction
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;and a &lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'&gt;number. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Everything else in our language is defined in a similar
fashion. In BNF, this is…&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i 
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;program&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;BNF, or Backus-Naur Form, is an important notation that
Irony uses to understand grammar definitions. If you are not familiar with it,
no sweat, it’s easy to pick up. There are plenty of quick online tutorials, and
Google is your friend.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Luckily, there is almost a direct syntactic translation
of this BNF description into C# through Irony’s use of overriding operators. First,
we must define our Terminals and NonTerminals. Terminals are often predefined
constructs, like a number or string. Here, our only Terminal is a number, which
we’ll define in terms of a regular expression as “a series of one or more
digits”:&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:navy;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;RegexBasedTerminal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:navy'&gt;RegexBasedTerminal&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;number&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;[0-9]+&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Everything else in our language is defined as a
NonTerminal like so:&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;

style='color:navy'&gt;NonTerminal&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;program&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:.5in'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:.5in'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:teal;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;moveStatements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; 
&lt;span style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:.5in'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;

style='color:navy'&gt;NonTerminal&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;direction&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Each string in the NonTerminal constructor will be
important later on when we navigate a parsed tree. Now we can translate the BNF
statements into something Irony can understand. The following is the real meat
of our language.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:green;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:teal;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;program&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
color:red;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:teal;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;Rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;createStatement&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span style='color:red'&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;startStatement&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span style='color:red'&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;moveStatements&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;This should look familiar; this was the first statement
in our BNF rules. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Saying &lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i 
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;this&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;intuitively means “&lt;b 
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;this&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
before &lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'&gt;that.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;” Similarly, &lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i 
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;this&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:red;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i 
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;means “&lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;that”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Anytime a string literal is the first element used in a
rule statement, as in both rules above, it’s good practice to put a ToTerm() function
surrounding the string. It’s not required, but erroneous parsing will occur if
ToTerm is not used like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Unfortunately, there is not a very easy way to describe the
“one or more” and “zero or more” rules. These are called “plus” and “star”
rules, respectively, which are drawn from a similar concept in Regex
expressions. Irony uses the MakePlusRule and MakeStarRule function to define
them. Both are used the same way syntactically, and MakePlusRule can be seen above
in the &lt;b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'&gt;&lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'&gt;moveStatements&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; rule.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
One more statement is required to finish the grammar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;And another statement that will help keep the tree

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;Start&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;at&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;

mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;, &lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span 
style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;Move&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;We’ll discuss this last statement in a little more depth
in section IV. That’s it! We have adequately defined a GridWorld grammar to
parse a GridWorld program. See the appendix for the complete &lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
color:navy;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;GridWorldGrammar &lt;/span&gt;class.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:16.0pt'&gt;III. Parsing source code
&amp;amp; validating syntax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Let’s say we have a GUI that has a Textbox, a Button, and
a Label. Our Textbox will allow the user to type or paste source code that is
in GridWorld syntax. Once a user places their code there, they press the
Button, and the Label will state whether or not the syntax is of the right
form. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;With Irony, this is a very simple operation. Here is a
function that returns whether or not some given source code with a given
grammar object is valid:&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:blue;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt; &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:
teal'&gt;isValid&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;sourceCode&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;Grammar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;grammar&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:
yes&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;LanguageData&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;language&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:blue'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;LanguageData&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;grammar&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:
yes&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;Parser&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;parser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:blue'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;Parser&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:
yes&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;ParseTree&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;parseTree&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;parser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:red'&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;Parse&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;sourceCode&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:
yes&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;ParseTreeNode&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;parseTree&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:red'&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;Root&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun:
yes&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:red'&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:blue'&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;The method this function uses is simple: attempt to parse
the given source code with the given grammar’s rules. If this attempt fails,
then the source code is not valid. Otherwise, it is valid. In this case we know
the parsing failed when the root of the parsed tree doesn’t exist (is of null
value). &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Obviously, there are different ways to implement this
code just as there are different ways to describe our GridWorld language to
Irony in the previous section. It is strongly suggested to explore other
possibilities, increase understanding and knowledge of how Irony works, and
thus reap the full benefits of the Irony tool.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:16.0pt'&gt;IV. Navigating the
language tree &amp;amp; validating content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;We’ve seen how Irony offers an easy and fast way to
validate syntax. Now we’re going to take a look at how to examine the content
of a parsed language tree. The following code is a function that returns the
root of a parsed language tree. As you can see, it looks very similar to the
isValid function above.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;

style='color:teal'&gt;getRoot&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;sourceCode&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:navy'&gt;Grammar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span 
style='color:teal'&gt;grammar&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;By using this function, we can explore and display source

&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Now, let’s parse some code and compare outputs. Recall this
statement we used at the very end of the grammar in section III:&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:teal;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;MarkPunctuation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;(&lt;span 
style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;Create&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;grid&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;by&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;Start&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;at&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
color:purple;mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;&amp;quot;location&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span 
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
mso-no-proof:yes'&gt;, &lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span 
style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:purple'&gt;&amp;quot;Move&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;If we had not included this statement, the parsed tree
from the source code in Figure 1 would look like that of Figure 2. However,
since we added the statement to “help keep the tree clean,” the parsed tree
looks like Figure 3. As you can see, MarkPunctuation is a very handy function.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

3&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Note: the names in this tree do not derive from the names
of the Terminal and NonTerminal variables we used when defining the grammar,
but rather from the string argument sent to the constructor of each variable
when they were each declared. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;There are a number of ways to now go about reading the
tree and producing some output. Note that this means your language is an
interpreted language, not a compiled language; you must write the interpreter.
I cooked up a function that uses the tree format in Figure 3 to create a grid
similar to the one in section 1. See it in the appendix or in the example code
included with this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;Checking content, as well as validating syntax, is an
important part of validating a language source code. This is because being able
to determine which parts of code are incorrect or correct allows the developer
to communicate to the user, often through syntax highlighting. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;For example, the function I wrote to display a grid from
the language tree here can be easily broken if the user writes GridWorld code
that goes off the grid, or tells the interpreter to start at a location not on
the grid. These mistakes certainly wouldn’t be caught by the syntax validator
function seen above; they are practically run-time errors. The developer could
decide to check for these sort of errors, and then highlight the offending
numbers in red. Thus, a user’s confusion and frustration can easily be avoided
by making use of a content-checker. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;That’s all there is to making a simple domain-specific
language parser with Irony!&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Please
see Code Appendix One or the included source code to view what was discussed in
the last few sections.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;The next section will deal with using some of Irony’s
more advanced tools, and then I will go into how to maintain a slightly more
complex language called “Manchester Syntax” that I created during the summer of
2010. &lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:16.0pt'&gt;V. Irony’s tools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p class=MsoNoSpacing&gt;See the README.txt file in the irony-XXXXX folder that
you downloaded from http://irony.codeplex.com/
for information on how to use Irony’s grammar explorer. &lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a CAPTCHA killer. It needs nothing on the form except a hidden field and some server-side code. 

== PHP Example ==
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
//... Your lovely form here
// Example, please adapt
echo &quot;&lt;input type=hidden name=url /&gt;&quot;;
//... Rest of your lovely form here
&lt;/source&gt;

=== verification ===
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
// compare
if ($_POST['url'] != &quot;&quot;) {
 // abort!
}
// processing code here
&lt;/source&gt;

===Usage===
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Language icon|&lt;language code&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

===Example===
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Language icon|eo}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; displays: {{Language icon|eo}}

===Note===
English is the default language, and does not need to be noted using this template, unless there is a reason the reader would assume the link to be in a foreign language (e.g. a foreign title).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Removing Subjects ==

=== Remove and auto-removed ===
In the course of your trial, chances are that you will have to &quot;remove&quot; a subject, or trial-participant. You can do this by using the menu-option Tasks-Administration-Subjects. In the list with all subjects you scroll to your Subject or you filter the list to get the right person. Then you click on the X-icon and the status of the person will change from &quot;available&quot; to &quot;removed&quot;.
So far so good. But you may be surprised to see the Subject still in the Subject-matrix and with status &quot;auto-removed&quot;.

First of all the difference between &quot;removed&quot; and &quot;auto-removed&quot;. &quot;Subject&quot; is one level higher than &quot;Study Subject&quot;, so if you remove a subject in the way described above, you remove the top-level and the sub-levels are &quot;auto-removed&quot;.
To see the same difference: Use the Subject-matrix and click on the magnifying glass-icon. Here you see option &quot;Study Subject Record&quot; (top) and &quot;Global Subject Record&quot; (bottom).

=== Cleaning your subject matrix ===
It is expected behaviour that after you &quot;remove&quot; a Study Subject or even after you &quot;remove&quot; a Subject, this person still shows up in the subject matrix, due to regulations.
If you do not want your list to get cluttered, consider creating an extra site for your study called &quot;RemovedSubjects&quot; or another appropriate name. You can assign Subjects to this site after &quot;removing&quot; them. This way they will not show up in the regular Subject-matrix.
Remember that this will only work if you specify assign users to one or more Study-sites, as opposed to assigning them to the whole Study.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This version of the Anti-CAPTCHA is stronger.

== Form Code ==
=== JavaScript ===
&lt;source lang=javascript&gt;
document.write(&quot;&lt;input type=hidden name=code value=&quot;+Math.random()+&quot; /&gt;&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

This must be in your form.

Use in an HTML form:
&lt;source lang=html4strict&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
document.write(&quot;&lt;input type=hidden name=code value=&quot;+Math.random()+&quot; /&gt;&quot;);
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Server-Side Code ===
Use this:
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
&lt;?php

if (!$_POST['code']) {
   // abort
}

?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Problems with this version ===
It hinders the usability, as people with JavaScript disabled (for example, for security reasons) won't be able to access your form.

== PHP 4 &amp;amp; 5 ==

=== Basic Level ===
* &lt;code&gt;echo &quot;''the text to print''&quot;;&lt;/code&gt; - This language construct will echo the text between the quotes. This is not a function but a language construct.
* &lt;code&gt;echo &quot;$var&quot;;&lt;/code&gt; - Notice the double quotation marks. Because double quotation marks are used, this will print the '''value''' of the variable. If $var=&quot;Bobby&quot;, this will output:
Bobby
* &lt;code&gt;echo '$var';&lt;/code&gt; - Notice that the quotation marks are now single. This will output the literal keystrokes inside the quotes.  The example will output:
$var
* &lt;code&gt;$var=&quot;Jericho&quot;;echo &quot;Joshua fit the battle of $var.&quot;;&lt;/code&gt; - Other than substituting the value of a variable for the variable name (and one or two other minor items), double quotes will quote literal keystrokes.  So this will output:

Joshua fit the battle of Jericho.

Again, if single quotes were used — &lt;code&gt;'Joshua fit the battle of $var';&lt;/code&gt; — this would output:

Joshua fit the battle of $var.
* &lt;code&gt;echo $var;&lt;/code&gt; - If you only want to print the value of a variable, you don't need quotes at all. If the value of $var is &quot;1214&quot;, the code will output:
1214
* &lt;code&gt;require &quot;''url''&quot;;&lt;/code&gt; - This language construct will include the page between the quotes. Can NOT be used with dynamic pages, e.g. &lt;code&gt;require(&quot;''main.php?username=SomeUser''&quot;);&lt;/code&gt; would ''not'' work. This is not a function but a language construct.
* &lt;code&gt;date(&quot;''Date/time format''&quot;);&lt;/code&gt; - Function which returns a date from a Unix Timestamp - where H is the hour, i is the minutes, s is the seconds, d is the day, m is the month and Y is the year in four digits - e.g. &lt;code&gt;date(&quot;H:i:s d/m/Y&quot;);&lt;/code&gt; would return &lt;code&gt;12:22:01 10/08/2006&lt;/code&gt; on 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; August 2006 at 12:22:01.
* &lt;code&gt;unlink(&quot;''filename''&quot;);&lt;/code&gt; - Function which deletes the file specified in ''filename''.

== PHP 4 ==
=== Basic Level ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  $variable1 = 'beginning';
  //This is a comment after a variable being defined
  if ($variable1 == 'beginning') {
    //If is a test to see if a variable has certain
    //value and initiates the wanted sequences if true
    echo 'Hello World!';
    //The echo displays to the page
  }
else
{
echo 'some code';
}

?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Basics, working only on PHP 5.

* &lt;code&gt;file_put_contents(&amp;quot;''filename''&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;''Text to save''&amp;quot;);&lt;/code&gt; - Functions which saves the text specified in ''Text to save'' to the file specified in ''filename''. Will overwrite existing file contents unless another parameter FILE_APPEND is added.
E.g. &lt;code&gt;file_put_contents(&amp;quot;''filename''&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;''Text to save''&amp;quot;);&lt;/code&gt; will write ''Text to save'' to ''filename'', but will overwrite existing text whereas &lt;code&gt;file_put_contents(&amp;quot;''filename''&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;''Text to save''&amp;quot;, FILE_APPEND);&lt;/code&gt; will write ''Text to save'' to ''filename'', but will '''not''' overwrite existing text (instead it appends).
