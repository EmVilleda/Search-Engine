      <text xml:space="preserve">Well in order to begin the proper light set up of OpenGl, you first have to understand the theory of micro quantimistics. This theory states that quantized light is refracted off of any surface at a congruent entrance as well as the departure for the surface, therefore we must take into account the refractive abstraction of the surface we are trying to create. To begin lighting, you must use the LIGHT_A_B_C operator. A,B, and C are variables that represent the different hues of light and color. A is for red, B is for green, and C is for blue. Most programmers pick their colors on programs such as paint and just transfer the numbers because most people do are not knowledgeable enough to memorize color consistencies. After you have chosen the type of light you want to be refracted and reflected from the surface, you have to put the direction and angle in brackets next to the operator. For example, LIGHT_23_13_4 {90 FRONT} beams a teal light on to your surface from the front in a perpendicular ray.

The fiddle tune &quot;Blackberry Blossom&quot;, a fiddle tune in the key of G Major, &lt;ref&gt;Website of Sean Ray|http://seanray.com/2010/blackberry-blossom-2/&lt;/ref&gt; is classified as a &quot;breakdown&quot; and is popular in old time, bluegrass &lt;ref&gt;ref name=Anthony|Building a Traditional Tune Repertoire|Wendy Anthony |http://archive.mandolinsessions.com/jun08/Anthony.html&lt;/ref&gt;and Celtic &lt;ref&gt;The Sessions&lt;/ref&gt;traditional circles. It is considered one of the best known fiddle tune of the twentieth century.

==History==

The tune &lt;ref&gt;ref name=DLA-Dickerson|played by Emma Lee Dickerson and| recorded by= Barbara Kunkle |date recorded=2-9-74|Greenup County, Kentucky|performer=Dickerson, Emma Lee|Place=Greenup County, Kentucky|Original Format=Reel-To-Reel Audio Tape|Holding Library|Berea College |http://www.aca-dla.org/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/Berea43&amp;CISOPTR=571&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=2&lt;/ref&gt; has been added to many tune books - as many as 277, according to The Session, an online resource for traditional musicians. &lt;ref&gt;ref name=The Session|Please expand this reference|http://www.thesession.org/tunes/display/1365&lt;/ref&gt;
The tune became popular as a tune recorded by &quot;Fiddlin'&quot; Arthur Smith and that version, according to Alan Jabbour, supplanted an earlier tune played by Sanford Kelly from Morgan County,&lt;ref&gt; Note: As an E minor tune. He ends the tune &quot;that's the way that God made peace&quot;.|http://www.aca-dla.org/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/Berea43&amp;CISOPTR=3533&amp;filename=3534.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; which is now represented by the tune &quot;Yew Piney Mountain&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;ref name=Jabbour BBB Transcript|cited=Wikiversity Ethnography of Fiddle|Fiddle tune played by Alan Jabbour at Berea College on 5-28-08, while participating in Berea's Appalachian Music Fellowship Program.c; Jabbour, Alan; Blackberry Blossom;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Blackberry Blossom|Lecture and performance by Alan Jabbour|Madison County, Kentucky|Audio Compact Disc|On web Digital Library of Appallachia| Archives, Hutchins Library, Department of Special Collections &amp; Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also called Garfield’s Blackberry Blossom, perhaps to distinguish it from the earlier version.&lt;ref&gt;ref name=Kuntz|The Fiddler’s Companion|Andrew Kuntz|1996[?]|Citing Jean Thomas's Ballad Makin' in the Mountains of Kentucky|http://www.ibiblio.org/fiddlers/BLACK.htm#BLACKBERRY_BLOSSOM_[2]&lt;/ref&gt; Contradicting Jabbour, who clearly distinguishes the earlier version, is the account of Andrew Kuntz to the effect that &quot;Betty Vornbrock and others have noted a similarity between 'Garfield’s Blackberry Blossom' and the West Virginia tune 'Yew Piney Mountain', a variant...also played by Kentucky fiddlers J.P. Fraley and and Santford Kelly&quot;. &lt;ref&gt; Kuntz&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture: use in different genres==

Although the tune is closely associated with the old time/ bluegrass traditions of the United States,&lt;ref&gt; Note: The Digital Library of Appallachia has recordings primarily from Kentucky. http://www.aca-dla.org/cdm4/results.php?CISOOP1=exact&amp;CISOFIELD1=CISOSEARCHALL&amp;CISOROOT=all&amp;CISOBOX1=%20Blackberry%20Blossom&lt;/ref&gt; it enjoys the distinction of often being frequently played by traditional Irish musicians.&lt;ref&gt; The Sessions&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Bluegrass===

According to Devon Wells, Blackberry Blossom, as a banjo tune, was brought to the public's attention as one of the earliest arrangements of  Bill Keith. &lt;ref&gt;ref name=Wells|Saturday, April 2, 2011|
Exploring Blackberry Blossom|Website of Devon Wells|Devon's Banjo Homepage|http://banjohomeplace.blogspot.com/2011/04/exploring-blackberry-blossom-part-i_02.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Wells, a bluegrass teacher, asserts that the tune is a standard in the bluegrass banjo repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;Wells&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the older recordings archived at the Digital Library of Appalachia include:

==Structure==
Like most traditional fiddle tunes, Blackberry Blossom has an A part and a B part; the former is in the key of G Major but the latter switches explicitly to the key of E minor. E minor is the relative minor of the key of G Major - it uses the same sharps and flats but its' modal center is E rather than G. This provides the tune with an unusual mood shift which adds complexity. &lt;ref&gt; Anthony&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Anthony, &quot;The note played on the 1st &amp; 3rd beat of the first 2 measures are the first 4 notes of the descending scale of G. Each of these notes is the beginning of a 3-note run, returning to to this base note, before moving on to the next note in the G scale. &quot;&lt;ref&gt; Anthony&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">From the supply side, most public transit systems operate service that has some common characteristics. The most salient of these are the ''vehicle cycle'' and the notion of ''capacity''. Later, we address some operating characteristics of specific modes, notably separating rail modes from fixed-route bus service.

== Concepts in operations and capacity ==

=== The vehicle cycle ===

It is useful to refer to the operation of a vehicle (van, bus, or train) through the course of a day of transit service; this is commonly referred to as the vehicle “cycle” because it tends to repeat itself from one day to the next. This cycle is illustrated in the figure below.

[[File:vehicle_cycle.png|600px|Caption The Vehicle Cycle]]

* The cycle begins when a vehicle is started from a depot (a garage, yard, or other location). The depot serves as a common location where vehicles are stored or maintained.

* The vehicle is positioned from the depot to a location where it can begin service. This is commonly at the terminus of a route. Such a movement, from the depot to this location, is called a “pull-out”.

* The vehicle travels from its starting location to another route terminus, stopping at stations or stops along the route to allow passengers to board and to alight. We will call such movement of the vehicle a “trip” (or, vehicle trip).

* While moving along the route, the vehicle incurs both running time and dwell time. Running time is the time spent traveling between stops or stations, and dwell time is the time spent stopped at locations to allow passengers to board and alight.

* While moving along the route, the vehicle is engaged in “revenue service”, so that time and miles spent along the route while providing passenger service are called “revenue hours” and “revenue miles”.

* When it reaches a route terminus, the vehicle is re-positioned for further service. If it returns along the same route or another route starting from the same terminus, there may be a short time for recovery before reentering revenue service, called a “layover”.

* A vehicle may also be moved between termini to start service on a different route, resulting in what is called a “deadhead” trip, not in revenue service, between the two termini.

* The vehicle continues in revenue service on the fixed routes, repeating the process of stopping at stations or stops to allow passengers to board and alight.

* When the vehicle has reached its final terminus for its set of trips, it returns to the depot. Such movement from a route terminus to the depot is called a “pull-in”.

This vehicle cycle is common to fixed-route service, particularly for bus and rail transit systems. In the case of demand-responsive service, there are no formal “termini” for a route; rather, the “termini” represent specific locations where persons are picked up or dropped off. At any point, if the vehicle becomes empty, then it may dead-head to the next pick-up location, or it may return to the depot.

=== Capacity ===

Capacity in transit operations is measured as the maximum number of passengers that can be carried past a single point on a fixed route, in a given period of time. The most common measure of capacity is in terms of passengers per hour.

In transit operations, we define the time between vehicles past a given point as the ''headway'' (or time headway), usually in minutes. The inverse of the headway is called the ''frequency'', essentially capturing the number of vehicles per unit time past a certain point on a route, usually measured in vehicles per hour.

&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rl}
 \text{Frequency (veh/hr)} &amp; f = \frac{60 \text{ min/hr}}{h} \\ 
  \\ 
 \text{Headway (in min)} &amp; h = \frac{60 \text{ min/hr}}{f} \\ 
 \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

As an example, a route with a 10-minute headway has a frequency of 6 vehicles per hour.

With this in mind, the capacity of a transit route is given as the product of the frequency and the maximum number of persons per vehicle:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rl}
 \text{Capacity (passengers/hr)}&amp; \text{on the route } = C_{route} = f \cdot N_{car} \cdot C_{car}  \\ 
  \\ 
 \text{where: } &amp; f = \text{ frequency on the route (veh/hr)} \\ 
  &amp; N_{car} = \text{number of cars per train (= 1 for bus)} \\ 
  &amp; C_{car} = \text{maximum number of persons per car (or bus)} \\ 
 \end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

As examples, a bus route with a frequency of 6 buses/hr and a maximum of 55 persons on each bus has a capacity of 330 passengers per hour. A rail line with a frequency of 15 trains/hr (4 min headways) with 6 cars per train and a maximum of 150 persons per car has a capacity of 13,500 passengers per hour.

Capacity is a very important concept in comparing different transit modes.

== Bus operations ==

Bus operations generally follow the traditional vehicle cycle presented above. Operation of each bus is under control of an operator (the driver). That operator is responsible for operating the bus safely along the route, as well as managing passenger boarding and alighting at stops along the route. They may also have responsibility for managing fare payment on board, and for ensuring passenger safety and security. 

One characteristic that is fairly common in bus operations is the notion of “hail-stop” operations. In practice, this means that a bus needs to stop at a stop or station only if a passenger wishes to board or alight; otherwise, the bus may simply bypass the stop at running speed. In this concept, passengers wishing to board or to alight must signal these intentions to the operator, so that he/she knows whether it is necessary to stop at the next stop or station.

In some cases, the bus may stop at all stops; this is more common where the bus has only a limited number of stops and/or high volumes of passengers boarding and alighting at these stops.

Capacity on a bus route is the product of the route’s frequency and the number of passengers on each bus. To get higher capacity, one may increase the frequency of buses or increase the passenger-carrying capacity of each bus, or both.

* In the case of frequency, the primary limitation on very high-frequency service (e.g., higher than one bus per minute) is the limitation on the number of berths for buses to stop at each station. Buses must stop for dwell time to allow passenger boarding and alighting at a stop, and the number of buses that can access the stop during that time depends on how many berths there are. If the average dwell time at a stop is 20 seconds, and the bus stop has only one berth, then the highest frequency of buses serving that stop would be 3 buses in a minute. Of course, reducing dwell times (e.g., boarding and alighting at multiple doors, eliminating paying the fare while boarding) allows for higher capacities in such cases. Also, having multiple berths, especially on route segments where many routes overlap, can also allow for higher frequency service.

* In the case of bus capacity, agencies may move away from a standard, single-level, 40-foot bus to higher-capacity buses, such as double-decked buses or articulated buses. These bus types may have significantly higher passenger loads than a standard bus.

Finally, when buses operate in mixed traffic, it is well known that maintaining a schedule can be a challenge. Signal timing, traffic congestion, traffic incidents, and other factors can disrupt the expected running times; the accommodation of passengers with bicycles or wheelchairs may similarly result in longer dwell times at stops. As a result, poor schedule adherence is a common challenge to service reliability. In many cases, transit agencies will allow for some “slack” in the normal schedule, including extra time in the schedule at various points along a route, and in the layover time at terminals, to allow any buses running behind schedule to catch up again.

It is well-known that higher-frequency bus service is prone to “bunching”: a preceding bus may fall behind schedule, and the subsequent bus runs ahead of schedule, until they form a pair of buses operating as one. To combat poor schedule adherence and bus bunching, bus operations may also include elements of real-time control. Such measures can include: (1) holding buses at stops to allow more equal headways; (2) encouraging drivers to speed up or slow down between stops to maintain the schedule; (3) in more extreme cases, allowing buses to skip stops or to “short-turn” (i.e., reverse direction on a route at a location other than the terminus) to improve schedule adherence or provide more capacity when the passenger demand surges on a certain segment of a route.

== Rail operations ==

Rail vehicles (trains) also follow the vehicle cycle shown earlier. Usually, however, the trains stop at every station on the route. Also, in many cases, fare collection is performed in the station, allowing all doors of the train to be used for passenger boarding and alighting.

Rail systems can run in a grade-separated environment with its own guideway and no conflicting traffic, in a mixed traffic environment with other road vehicles, or in some combination of these two environments. As may be obvious, having a grade-separated environment allows trains to operate with few limitations, allowing higher speeds and much more reliable service (with good schedule adherence and minimal travel time variability). Once rail becomes subject to mixed traffic, speeds can drop and service often becomes less reliable.

Rail systems most commonly operate on electric power being transmitted to the vehicle through either what is called a “third rail”, located just off the ground near the existing rails, or through an overhead catenary.

The operation of rail systems is usually controlled by signal systems which indicate appropriate operating conditions to the train operator, either through signals on the wayside or through signals in the train cab. Traditionally, these signal systems are arranged according to fixed segments of track called “blocks”. These blocks are defined in such a way as to control for safe operation of the train system: no two trains can be located in a single block at the same time. This may be left to the control of the train operator, or an automated or semi-automated system can be employed to enforce these block restrictions.

In a “fixed-block” signal system, the signals have indications with various colors and patterns that prescribe the proper train operation. In the system illustrated below, a red signal is used to indicate stop, a yellow signal to indicate to reduce speed for a red signal ahead, and a green signal to indicate clear to proceed. The most common logic dictating signal the signal indication is based on the occupancy of the block(s) ahead of the signal. In the case below, red indicates the subsequent block is occupied; yellow that the subsequent signal is red; and green that the two subsequent blocks are not occupied. As trains move from block to block (from time ''t'' to ''t''+1 to ''t''+2), the indications in the signal system change accordingly.

[[File:Rail signal.png|600px|Caption Illustration of Rail Signaling]]

The capacity of a rail line is based on the frequency of trains, the number of cars per train, and the maximum number of persons per car.

* The frequency is usually constrained at the upper end by the amount of time a train occupies a block. Since two trains can occupy the same block, the longest time to traverse a block becomes the minimum headway between trains; the highest frequency is then the inverse of the minimum headway. To increase frequency (and hence increase capacity), one must reduce the block length or determine other ways to control vehicle operation.

* Usually, the number of cars per train is limited by the geometry of the station platforms, or of other route geometric features (e.g., the distance between two cross-streets in mixed operation). When the train stops at a station, all cars allow passengers to board and alight, meaning that all cars must fit on the platform. So, adding cars to trains is only possible if all stations on the line can allow the cars to fit on the platform.

* Car capacity depends in part on the length of the car and the arrangement of seating and standing space within the car. Greater standing space means more capacity, although passengers will be less comfortable.

Finally, some rail systems have fully automated or semi-automated operation, where the train speed may be controlled through an automated system. Signals are transmitted through the rails or through the power system to the train motors, indicating the appropriate speed for a given block.

== Sample problem ==

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|TProblem]]'''Problem:'''&lt;br&gt;

A transit agency has an existing 8.5-mile bus route (in one direction) where the average speed *between* stops is 16.9 miles per hour. The route has 22 stops along the route. If the average dwell time at each stop is 18 seconds, what is the average bus speed along the route as a whole?

And, if a 5-minute layover is required at the far end of the route, what is the total round-trip travel time? Assume the time for the inbound trip is identical in time to the outbound trip.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #02D4EE; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]]'''Solution:'''&lt;br&gt;

Total travel time = (8.5 mi) / (16.9 mi/hr) + (22 stops)*(18 sec/stop)*(1 hr / 3600 sec)
		= 0.613 hr = 37 minutes (rounded up to the nearest minute)

The average speed = (8.5 mi / 0.613 hr) = 13.9 mph.

The total round-trip time = 37 min + 5 min layover + 37 min = 79 min
&lt;/div&gt;

== Glossary ==

* Bunching: The phenomenon in which two buses become closer to one another on a route, in some cases even joining one another along the route.

* Deadhead: A trip between route termini while the vehicle is not in revenue service; typically taken to reposition the vehicle to start service on a new route.

* Hail-stop operation: A vehicle need only stop at a station if there are passengers desiring to board or to alight. Otherwise, the vehicle can continue without stopping.

* Layover: A short period of time between the end of revenue service on one trip and the resumption of revenue service on the next (vehicle) trip, at a common terminus.

* Pull-in: The movement of a vehicle from a route terminus back to the depot at the end of revenue service.

* Pull-out: The movement of a vehicle from the depot to a route terminus to begin revenue service.

* Revenue service: The movement of a vehicle along a route where passengers may board and alight.

* Schedule slack: a short amount of time inserted into the schedule on a route to improve schedule adherence

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Digital Filters ==

Digital filters are by essence sampled systems.
The input and output signals are represented by samples with equal time distance.

== FIR Filters ==

''Finite Implulse Response'' (FIR) filters are characterized by a time response depending only on a given number of the last samples of the input signal.
In other terms: once the input signal has fallen to zero, the filter output will do the same after a given number of sampling periods.

The output &lt;math&gt;y(k)&lt;/math&gt; is given by a linear combination of the last input samples &lt;math&gt;x(k-i)&lt;/math&gt;.
:: &lt;math&gt;y(k) = \sum_{i = 0}^{N-1} b(i) \cdot x(k-i)&lt;/math&gt;
The coefficients &lt;math&gt;b(i)&lt;/math&gt; give the weight for the combination.
They also correspond to the coefficients of the numerator of the z-domain filter transfer function.

The following figure shows an FIR filter of order &lt;math&gt;N + 1&lt;/math&gt;:
: [[File:FIR Filter.svg|750px]]
For linear phase filters, the coefficient values are symmetric around the middle one and the delay line can be folded back around this middle point in order to reduce the number of multiplications.

The transfer function of FIR filters only pocesses a numerator.
This corresponds to an all-zero filter. 

FIR filters typically require high orders, in the magnitude of several hundreds.
Thus the choice of this kind of filters will need a great amount of hardware or CPU.
Despite of this, one reason to choose a FIR filter implementation is the ability to achieve a linear phase response, which can be a requirement in some cases.
Nevertheless, the fiter designer has the possibility to choose IIR filters with a good phase linearity in the passband, such as [[Signals_and_Systems/Filter_Implementations#Bessel_Filters|Bessel filters]],
or to design an allpass filter to correct the phase response of a standard IIR filter.

=== Moving Average Filters (MA) ===

'''Moving Average''' (MA) models are process models in the form:
:&lt;math&gt;u(n) = \sum_{m = 0}^M a^*(m)x(n-m)&lt;/math&gt;
MA processes is an alternate representation of FIR filters.

=== Average Filters ===

A filter calculating the average of the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; last samples of a signal 
:: &lt;math&gt;y(k) = \frac{1}{N} \cdot \sum_{i = 0}^{N-1} x(k-i)&lt;/math&gt;
It is the simplest form of an FIR filter, with all coefficients being equal.

The transfer function of an average filter is given by:
:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  H(z) &amp;= \frac{1}{N} \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}z^{-i} \\
       &amp;= \frac{1}{N} \cdot \left ( \frac{1-z^{-N}}{1-z^{-1}} \right ) 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The transfer function of an average filter has &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; equally spaced zeroes along the frequency axis.
However, the zero at DC is masked by the pole of the filter.
Hence, there is a larger lobe a DC which accounts for the filter passband.

=== Cascaded Integrator-Comb (CIC) Filters ===

A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIC_filter Cascaded integrator-comb filter] (CIC) is a special technique for implementing average filters placed in series.
The series placement of the average filters enhances the first lobe at DC compared to all other lobes.

A CIC filter implements the transfer function of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; average filters, each calculating the average of &lt;math&gt;R M&lt;/math&gt; samples.
Its transfer function is thus given by:
:: &lt;math&gt;H(z) = \left ( \frac{1-z^{-R \cdot M}}{1-z^{-1}} \right )^N&lt;/math&gt;

CIC filters are used for decimating the number of samples of a signal by a factor of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;
or, in others terms, to resample a signal at a lower frequency, throwing away &lt;math&gt;R-1&lt;/math&gt; samples out of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.
The factor &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; indicates how much of the first lobe is used by the signal.
The number of average filter stages, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, indicates how well other frequency bands are damped, at the expense of a less flat transfer function around DC.

The CIC structure allows to implement the whole system with only adders and registers, not using any multipliers which are greedy in terms of hardware.

Downsampling by a factor of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; allows to increase the signal resolution by &lt;math&gt;\log_{2}(R)&lt;/math&gt; bits.

== IIR Filters ==

=== Canonical filters ===

Canonical filters implement a filter transfer function with a number of delay elements equal to the filter order, one multiplier per numerator coefficient, one multiplier per denominator coefficient and a series of adders.
Similarily to active filters canonical structures, this kind of circuits showed to be very sensitive to element values: a small change in a coefficients had a large effect on the transfer function.

Here too, the design of active filters has shifted from canonical filters to other structures such as ''chains of second order sections'' or ''leapfrog filters''.

=== Chain of Second Order Sections ===

A ''second order section'', often referred as ''biquad'', implements a second order transfer function.
The transfer function of a filter can be split into a product of transfer functions each associated to a pair of poles and possibly a pair of zeroes.
If the transfer function's order is odd, then a first order section has to be added to the chain.
This section is associated to the real pole and to the real zero if there is one.

The most known [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_biquad_filter biquad structures] are
* direct-form 1
* direct-form 2
* direct-form 1 transposed
* direct-form 2 transposed

The direct-form 2 transposed of the following figure is especially interesting in terms of required hardware as well as signal and coefficient quantization.
: [[File:Biquad_direct_form_2_transposed.svg|300 px]]

=== Digital Leapfrog Filters ===

==== Filter Structure ====

''Digital leapfrog filters'' base on the simulation of [[Signal_Processing/Analog_Filters#Leapfrog_Filters|analog active leapfrog filters]].
The incentive for this choice is to inherit from the excellent passband sensitivity properties of the original [[Signal_Processing/Analog_Filters#Ladder_filters|ladder circuit]].

The following 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order all-pole lowpass leapfrog filter

: [[File:Leapfrog filter order 4.svg]]

can be implemented as a digital circuit by replacing the analog integrators with accumulators.

: [[File:Digital_leapfrog_filter_order_4.svg]]

Replacing the analog integrators with accumulators corresponds to simplify the Z-transform to &lt;math&gt;z = 1 + sT&lt;/math&gt;, which are the two first terms of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series Taylor series] of &lt;math&gt;z = exp(sT)&lt;/math&gt;.
This approximation is good enough for filters where the sampling frequency is much higher than the signal bandwidth.

==== Transfer Function ====

The [[Signal Processing/Filter Design#State Space Representation|state space representation]] of the preceeding filtre can be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{ccrcccccc}
 z \cdot \begin{bmatrix}w_1\\w_2\\w_3\\w_4\end{bmatrix} &amp;
 = &amp;
 \begin{bmatrix}1-\frac{T}{t_1} &amp; -\frac{T}{t_1} &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\frac{T}{t_2} &amp; 1 &amp; -\frac{T}{t_2} &amp; 0\\0 &amp; \frac{T}{t_3} &amp; 1 &amp; -\frac{T}{t_3}\\0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{T}{t_4} &amp; 1-\frac{T}{t_4}\end{bmatrix} &amp;
 \cdot &amp;
 \begin{bmatrix}w_1\\w_2\\w_3\\w_4\end{bmatrix} &amp;
 + &amp;
 \begin{bmatrix}\frac{T}{t_1}\\0\\0\\0\end{bmatrix} &amp;
 \cdot &amp;
 U_{in} \\
 U_{out} &amp;
 = &amp;
 \begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix} &amp;
 \cdot &amp;
 \begin{bmatrix}w_1\\w_2\\w_3\\w_4\end{bmatrix} &amp;
 + &amp;
 \begin{bmatrix}0\end{bmatrix} &amp;
 \cdot &amp;
 U_{in}
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;


From this equation set, one can write the A, B, C, D matrices as:

: &lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix}1-\frac{T}{t_1} &amp; -\frac{T}{t_1} &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\frac{T}{t_2} &amp; 1 &amp; -\frac{T}{t_2} &amp; 0\\0 &amp; \frac{T}{t_3} &amp; 1 &amp; -\frac{T}{t_3}\\0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{T}{t_4} &amp; 1-\frac{T}{t_4}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;B = \begin{bmatrix}\frac{T}{t_1}\\0\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;C = \begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;D = \begin{bmatrix}0\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

From this representation, signal processing tools such as [[Octave_Programming_Tutorial|Octave]] or [[MATLAB Programming|Matlab]] allow to plot the filter's [[Signals and Systems/Frequency Response|frequency response]] or to examine its [[Signal Processing/Filter Design#Zeroes, Poles and Gain|zeroes and poles]].

In the digital leapfrog filter, the relative values of the coefficients set the shape of the transfer function ([[Signals_and_Systems/Filter_Implementations#Butterworth_Filters|Butterworth]], [[Signals_and_Systems/Filter_Implementations#Chebyshev_Filters|Chebyshev]], …), whereas their amplitudes set the cutoff frequency.
Dividing all coefficients by a factor of two shifts the cutoff frequency down by one octave (also a factor of two).

A special case is the Buterworth 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; order filter which has time constants with relative values of 1, 1/2 and 1.
Due to that, this filter can be implemented in hardware without any multiplier, but using shifts instead.

=== Autoregressive Filters (AR) ===

'''Autoregressive''' (AR) models are process models in the form:

:&lt;math&gt;u(n) = \sum_{m = 1}^M a^*(m)u(n-m) + x(n)&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''u(n)'' is the output of the model, ''x(n)'' is the input of the model, and ''u(n - m)'' are previous samples of the model output value. These filters are called &quot;autoregressive&quot; because output values are calculated based on regressions of the previous output values. AR processes can be represented by an all-pole filter.

=== ARMA Filters ===

'''Autoregressive Moving-Average''' (ARMA) filters are combinations of AR and [[Signal_Processing/Types_of_Filters#Moving_Average_Filters_.28MA.29|MA]] filters. The output of the filter is given as a linear combination of both the weighted input and weighted output samples:

:&lt;math&gt;u(n) = \sum_{m = 0}^M a^*(m)x(n-m) + \sum_{k = 1}^K b^*(k)y(n-k)&lt;/math&gt;

ARMA processes can be considered as a digital IIR filter, with both poles and zeros.

== Yule-Walker Equations ==

AR filters are preferred in many instances because they can be analyzed using the '''Yule-Walker equations'''. MA and ARMA processes, on the other hand, can be analyzed by complicated nonlinear equations which are difficult to study and model. 

If we have an AR process with tap-weight coefficients '''a''' (a vector of ''a(n), a(n - 1), ...'') an input of ''x(n)'', and an output of ''y(n)'', we can use the yule-walker equations. We say that &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance of the input signal. We treat the input data signal as a random signal, even if it is a deterministic signal, because we do not know what the value will be until we receive it. We can express the Yule-Walker equations as:

{{eqn|Yule-Walker Equations}}
:&lt;Math&gt;\bold{R}\bold{a} = \bold{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Where '''R''' is the cross-correlation matrix of the process output

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{R} = E[y(n)y^H(n)]&lt;/math&gt;

And '''r''' is the autocorrelation matrix of the process output:

:&lt;math&gt;\bold{r} = E[y(n)y^*(n)]&lt;/math&gt;

=== Variance ===

We can show that:

:&lt;math&gt;r(0) = \sigma_y^2&lt;/math&gt;

We can express the input signal variance as:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \sum_{k = 0}^M a(k) r(k)&lt;/math&gt;

Or, expanding and substituting in for ''r(0)'', we can relate the output variance of the process to the input variance:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \sigma_y^2 + \sum_{k = 1}^M a(k) r(k)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview == 

The process of planning and designing public transit service is called “service planning”. There are a number of activities commonly associated with service planning:

# Network design
# Route design and stop layout
# Frequency determination
# Timetabling
# Vehicle scheduling
# Crew scheduling

These are ordered roughly in terms of a general sequence in time, as well as of a dependence upon higher-level activities. The general design of a transit network is the highest level activity, undertaken only rarely or when major new systems (e.g., rail or express bus) are introduced. The network design then feeds an element of route design and stop layout, in which the more specific physical facilities for the routes and stops or stations are implemented. Once routes are in place, the frequency of service may be determined, and a timetable for vehicle trips (the service) along the route can be constructed. Once the timetable is created, schedules for vehicles on the route and throughout the network (i.e., the vehicle cycle for each vehicle in the fleet) can be created. Finally, work shifts for operators can be generated (a crew schedule), and those operators are assigned to the work.

The first three activities, in network and route design and frequency determination, tend to be more strategic in nature, and may only be considered infrequently by transit planners. These decisions tend to be driven in part by political and economic considerations, and as such may require careful and strategic thinking on the part of transit planners. This unit discusses these strategic issues.

The activities of timetabling and vehicle and crew scheduling are considered more tactical decisions, as these decisions are made as often as the transit agency may consider reviewing or changing schedules. In many cases, these tactical activities are assisted by software tools that can generate high quality solutions in a short period of time, often with direct interaction with the planner. These topics are discussed in the next unit.

== Network and route design ==

=== Network design ===

There are many different ways of structuring a set of transit routes into a network to provide transit service to a given area. These might include any combination of:

* Radial services, focusing on collecting passengers from outlying areas and bringing them into a major trip generator (e.g., a downtown area, major employment center, or other significant destination);

* Cross-town or grid-like routes, focusing on connecting passengers across the area, perhaps between radial services or among several smaller trip generators; and,

* Direct connections, focusing on moving passengers between major trip generators (e.g., between downtown and a high-density residential area, or between a major employer and downtown).

* Circulators, focusing on collecting and distributing passengers in smaller sub-areas.

Usually, transit networks are made up of some combination of these types of routes, allowing a satisfactory level of access to most of the region, with a high degree of direct service to major trip generators. Sometimes, this may involve a combination of modes. For example, in Boston, the rail systems are strongly radial, while the bus system provides cross-town and circulator services. The scale image below shows the strong radial nature of these lines, directed to downtown Boston.

[[File:MBTA Boston subway map.png | Boston Rail Lines]]

Other systems, particularly bus systems, can include both cross-town and radial services, allowing more coverage and greater direct access to destinations. One example is the bus network of New Jersey Transit in and around Newark, shown in the figure below. One can clearly see both radial routes as well as a strong grid-like structure on the west side of downtown.

[[File:Newark buses.svg | 500px | Newark Bus Lines]]

Regardless, in the US, the network structure is usually strongly influenced by political and economic realities, with strong citizen and political input as well as hard budget constraints. However, from a transportation perspective, the resulting network may be characterized in several important ways:

* ''Geographic coverage'', often influenced by political considerations as well as objectives to provide mobility for lower-mobility populations;

* ''Temporal coverage'', determining what time periods on weekdays and on weekends to offer service; and,

* ''Connectivity'' (direct vs. indirect service), with the desire to connect major trip generators with direct routes but perhaps allowing transfer trips to serve lower-demand areas.

These characteristics play a major role in estimating demand for the service. Specifically, the analyst may wish to experiment with a variety of network structures and routes, in order to estimate the level of demand that each network might support. Well-specified travel demand models should be able to account for geographic and temporal coverage, as well as trip connectivity, in forecasting transit usage.

As an important caveat, most transit agencies do not usually approach network design as if from scratch. Most agencies do have some existing route patterns, and associated infrastructure (stops, terminals, guideways, etc.) that may often constrain certain route structures or at least strongly favor maintaining some of the existing routes. As a result, most agencies consider new elements of the network (new routes and services) as a complement to existing services, with more modest adjustments to the existing route structures. However, where new modes of service may be introduced (e.g., rail systems in traditionally bus-oriented networks), more significant restructuring of service may be possible, perhaps extending service to new geographic areas, intensifying service in existing service areas, or supplementing the new mode by directing routes to connect to and from the new mode.

=== Route design ===

In conjunction with network design, a planner must also consider specific routes and their purpose. The layout of individual routes usually involves some trade-offs in design, most notably:

* ''Stop density''. Stop density involves the trade-off of passenger access vs. route speed. Higher stop densities mean that passengers will not have to walk or travel far to get to a stop, allowing easier access to transit service. However, higher stop densities also mean that the vehicle may be stopping frequently, reducing the overall operating speed. 

* ''Route length and circuitousness''. Route length involves the trade-off of direct service vs. service reliability. Longer routes allow passengers to get to more potential destinations, as the route provides direct service to a larger geographic area. But, longer routes may lead to poor schedule adherence, as service may be more prone to travel time variability and/or service disruptions.

* ''Trip generators''. The route can serve major trip generators or more minor trip generators, or some combination of these. Often, routes have termini that coincide with major trip generators, with higher passenger flows occurring between these major generators. However, there may also be a need to serve certain geographic areas with modest demand.

In many cases, some combination of routes can be built into the transit network that provides some balance in each of these areas. Common route designs include the following:

* Line haul: high frequency and/or high capacity service on major travel corridors

* Loops (one-way or two-way): coverage for lower-density areas or circulation in and among activity centers

* Short turn routes: to complement a full route, additional service provided on a shorter segment (the “short turn”) of the route

* Branching (or split) routes: branching toward the end of the route, with areas served by only some buses

* Feeder routes: connect to/from line haul from/to lower density areas

* Limited and express routes: only stop at major stops/stations to improve travel times, balance loads 

* Zonal service: only serve some sections in a major corridor

== Stop density and location ==

As noted above, stop density can affect both access and the overall speed of transit service. Given the time and distance necessary for vehicle acceleration and deceleration, a high density of stops will lead to much slower overall speeds, when the vehicles must stop at many or all of the stops. Yet, this provides much easier access for passengers, who must only travel a short distance to their nearest stop.

General guidelines suggest higher stop densities where land uses are likewise at higher density (downtown areas, major activity centers) and much lower where land uses are at much lower densities.&lt;ref&gt;Transportation Research Board (2003). Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, Transit Cooperative Research Program, Report 100, 2nd Edition. [http://www.trb.org/news/blurb_detail.asp?id=2326]&lt;/ref&gt; But, this guidance may depend on a number of factors. If the probability of stopping is low, then increasing the stop density may come at only a modest cost, in terms of providing additional stop infrastructure. In addition, the lack of easy stop access may also serve as a deterrent to ridership, or may require other accommodations for access, such as large garages or lots for park-and-ride access.

A second area for design involves the suitable location for stops. As may be obvious, the best location for stops is as close to supportive land uses as possible. So, for major trip generators such as high-density work locations (office buildings, retail areas, etc.) and other locations, having a stop directly at or adjacent to the location is best. In many other instances, having stops near intersections may improve pedestrian access to land uses at the intersection or in nearby areas on any cross-street.

In bus operations, stops at intersections include “near-side” and “far-side” stops, referring to whether the stop occurs before or after the bus traverses through the intersection, respectively. Because of the potential conflicts with traffic flow at intersections, however, there are some who might advocate for locating stops away from intersections (“mid-block” locations). An excellent discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of near-side, far-side, and mid-block stops can be found in a recent TCRP Report.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Transportation Institute (1996). Guidelines for the Location and Design of Bus Stops, Transit Cooperative Research Program Report 19, Transportation Research Board, Washington, DC: National Research Council. [http://www.trb.org/Publications/Blurbs/Guidelines_for_the_Location_and_Design_of_Bus_Stop_153827.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Many agencies have specific policies regarding near-side or far-side stops, but these are in general much preferred to mid-block stops.

== Frequency determination ==

There are a number of ways that planners may determine a reasonable frequency of service on a route. The most common methods are:&lt;ref&gt;Peter Furth and Nigel Wilson (1981). “Setting Frequencies on Bus Routes: Theory and Practice,” Transportation Research Record 818, 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Policy headways'''. Many transit agencies will determine specific headways that meet policy goals, usually related to providing a minimum level of service along a route when demand on the route is low. This could include 30-minute or 60-minute headways, for example.

* '''Minimum headways'''. As discussed in the unit on transit operations, bus and rail systems have minimum headways, based on capacity limitations. In cases when demand on a route is very high, these minimum headways can be used to assign the maximum frequencies on the route.

* '''Load management'''. In many cases where policy headways or minimum headways do not apply, the typical way of determining frequencies is based on managing load at the ''peak load point'' along the route. The peak load point is that point along the route that experiences the largest number of passengers per hour. Let ''X'' be the highest allowable ratio of demand to supply (volume to capacity), with values between 0 and 1 (with 1 when volume = capacity). Then:

&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{rl}
  &amp; \frac{P}{f \cdot N_{car} \cdot C_{car} } \le X \text{   or,   } f \ge \frac{P}{X \cdot N_{car} \cdot C_{car} } \\ 
  \\ 
 \text{with} &amp; P = \text{volume at peak load point (passengers/hr)} \\ 
  &amp; X = \text{maximum allowable volume-to-capacity ratio, } 0 \le X \le 1 \\ 
  &amp; N_{car}  = \text{number of cars in a train (= 1 for buses)} \\ 
  &amp; C_{car}  = \text{number of passengers per car} \\ 
 \end{array} &lt;/math&gt;

: For a bus route operated with 55-passenger buses, a demand of 360 passengers per hour past the peak load point, and an allowable load factor of X = 0.90, the frequency must be:

&lt;math&gt;
 f \ge \frac{360 \text{ passengers/hr}}{0.90 \cdot 1 \cdot (55 \text{ passengers/bus})} = \underline {7.27 \text{ buses/hr}}
&lt;/math&gt;

: This would give the planner options for this route such as 7.5 buses/hr (8-min headways) or 8 buses/hr (7.5-min headways), or even higher frequencies.

These are the most common methods for determining frequencies.

From a more rigorous perspective, it can be shown that if one combines operating costs with passenger waiting costs, the “optimal” (cost-minimizing) frequency is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Mohring (1972). “Optimization and Scale Economies in Urban Bus Transportation,” American Economic Review, 62(4), 591-604.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}
 \ &amp; f = \sqrt { \frac{VOT \cdot p}{2 \cdot C \cdot T} }  \\ 
 \ &amp; \\ 
  \text{with: } &amp; VOT = \text{value of passenger waiting time } (\$ \text{ per passenger-hour}) \\ 
 &amp; p = \text{total boardings per hour on the route, both directions (passengers per hour)} \\ 
  &amp; C = \text{operating cost per hour per vehicle } (\$ \text{ per vehicle-hour}) \\ 
  &amp; T = \text{total round trip travel time along the route (hours)}  \\

 \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

The important observation from this formula is that the frequency increases with the square root of the total passenger boardings. The square root balances the operating costs, which grow linearly with the frequency, with the passenger waiting time, which decreases inversely with the frequency.

With a value of waiting time of $15/hr, passenger boardings of 750 passengers per hour, operating costs of $80/vehicle-hour, and a round-trip travel time of 1.75 hours, we have:

&lt;math&gt;
f = \sqrt {\frac{(\$ 15/\text{passenger-hr}) \cdot (750 \text{ passengers/hr})}{2 \cdot (\$ 80/\text{veh-hr}) \cdot (1.75 \text{ hr/veh})}}  = \underline {6.34 \text{ veh/hr}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

which could be rounded to 6 veh/hr (10 min headways) or to 6.67 veh/hr (9 min headways), assuming that the transit agency would prefer to have integer-valued headways.

== Sample problem ==

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|TProblem]]'''Problem:'''&lt;br&gt;

A transit agency is considering changing the frequency on a popular route. Currently, the route serves 1175 passengers in the peak hour, operating at a frequency of 10 buses per hour.

Using Mohring's formula, what is the &quot;optimal&quot; frequency on this route? Use a cost per bus-hour of operation of $66, a value of time of $11 per hour, and a route round-trip time of 95 minutes.

If a comparable demand elasticity with respect to frequency is +0.37 for the peak hour, estimate the total number of passengers in the peak hour for this &quot;optimal&quot; frequency.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #02D4EE; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]]'''Solution:'''&lt;br&gt;

The optimal frequency is given as:

&lt;math&gt;f = \sqrt{ \frac{VOT \cdot p}{2 \cdot C \cdot T} } = \sqrt{ \frac{$11 \cdot 1175 \text{ passengers}}{ 2 \cdot $66 \cdot 95 min/60 min/hr)}} = &lt;/math&gt; 7.86 buses/hr, which we might round up to 8 buses/hr.

At 8 buses/hr, the net change in the frequency is -20%, yielding a percentage change in ridership of (+0.37)*(-20%) = -7.4%, or (-7.4%)*(1175 passengers) = 87 passengers. The new ridership would then be 1088 passengers.

&lt;/div&gt;

== Section 2: Example/Exemplar Resources ==
This section is intended as a place were teachers and contributors can post social studies ['''example units, lesson plans, activities, &amp; class projects'''] that leverage educational technology in order to help teachers teach or students learn social studies. It is also a place where teachers may post the results of various online projects their classes have done. 

This section is also intended to inform the first section concerning various educational media. The content in this section will act as a rich resource for contributors that are highlighting various educational technology media. Contributors can draw examples, illustrations, and anecdotes from this section in order to discuss the employment of educational technology meaningfully in their contributions to the first section of this book. The hope is that contributors who are not educators by profession will not be deterred from adding their ideas for lack of direct experience in the classroom. Rather, they can draw on the ['''example units, lesson plans, activities, &amp; class projects''']within this database in order to illustrate their ideas.

Lastly, the contents of this section will serve as ideas and suggestions for how to implement educational technology within the social studies classroom upon this book's completion. Therefore, these resources will serve as both examples and exemplars.

&quot;'''Star of the County Down'''&quot; is an old [[Irish ballad]] set near [[Banbridge]] in [[County Down]], in [[Northern Ireland]]. The words are by Cathal McGarvey, 1866–1927, from [[Ramelton]], [[County Donegal]].&lt;ref name = &quot;col1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last= O'Lochlainn|first= Colm|year= 1967|publisher= Three Candles Press|location= Dublin|title= Songwriters of Ireland in the English Tongue}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tune of the song, a [[pentatonic]] melody, is similar to that of several other works, including the almost identical English tune &quot;Kingsfold&quot;, well known from several popular hymns, such as &quot;Led By the Spirit.&quot; The folk tune was the basis for [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]' ''[[Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus]]''. 

The melody was also used in an old Irish folk song called My Love Nell.&lt;ref&gt;Folksongs&amp;Ballads popular in Ireland, Volume 3, Loesberg,pp72&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics &lt;ref&gt;http://www.chethams.org.uk/axon_ballads/095.htm&lt;/ref&gt; of My Love Nell tell the story of young man who courts a girl but loses her when she emigrates to America. The only real similarity with Star of the County Down is that Nell too comes from County Down. This may have inspired McGarvey to place the heroine of his new song in Down as well. McGarvey was from Donegal. 

The Star of the County Down uses a tight rhyme scheme. Each [[stanza]] is a double [[quatrain]], and the first and third lines of each quatrain have an internal rhyme on the second and fourth feet: [aa]b[cc]b. The refrain is a single quatrain with the same rhyming pattern.

The song is sung from the point of view of a young man who chances to meet a charming lady by the name of Rose (or Rosie) McCann, referred to as the &quot;star of the County Down&quot;. From a brief encounter the writer's infatuation grows until, by the end of the ballad, he imagines wedding the girl.

One popular arrangement was recorded by Rick Summer Droit on his &lt;ref&gt;[[Laughing Like A Banshee]]&lt;/ref&gt; CD released in 2000

One popular adaptation (keeping the music, but changing the lyrics) is &quot;The Fighting 69th&quot;, which is about the famed [[Irish Brigade (U.S.)|Irish Brigade]] of the [[American Civil War]].

The melody is also used for the carol &quot;The Seven Rejoices of Mary,&quot; sung by [[Loreena McKennitt]] on ''[[A Midwinter Night's Dream]]'' and for the eponymous song on [[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (album)]].

A parody of the song was produced by &quot;Trifolkal&quot; called &quot;The Starbucks of County Down&quot;.

==Lyrics==
&lt;poem&gt;
Near  Banbridge town, in the County Down
One morning in July
Down a bóithrín green came a sweet cailín
And she smiled as she passed me by.
Oh she looked so sweet from her two bare feet
To the sheen of her nut brown hair
Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself
To be sure I was really there.

Chorus:
And from Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay
And from Galway to Dublin town
No maid I've seen like the sweet cailín
That I met in the County Down.

As she onward sped I shook my head
And I gazed with a feeling rare
And I said, says I, to a passerby
&quot;Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?&quot;
He smiled at me, and with pride says he,
&quot;That's the gem of Ireland's crown.
She's young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann
She's the star of the County Down.&quot;

Chorus

I've travelled a bit, but never was hit
Since my roving career began
But fair and square I surrendered there
To the charms of young Rose McCann.
I'd a heart to let and no tenant yet
Did I meet with in shawl or gown
But in she went and I asked no rent
From the star of the County Down.

Chorus

At the crossroads fair I'll be surely there
And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes
And I'll try sheep's eyes, and deludhering lies
On the heart of the nut-brown rose.
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
Though with rust my plow turns brown
Till a smiling bride by my own fireside
Sits the star of the County Down.

Chorus
&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Tam''' (or '''Tamas''')  '''Lin''' (also called '''Tamlane''', '''Tamlin''', '''Tomlin''', '''Tam Lien''', '''Tam-a-Line''', or '''Tam Lane''') is the [[hero]] of a [[legend]]ary [[ballad]] originating from the [[Scottish Borders]]. The story revolves around the rescue of Tam Lin by his true love from the Queen of the [[fairy|Fairies]]. While this [[ballad]] is specific to [[Scotland]], the motif of capturing a person by holding him through all forms of [[Shapeshifting#Transformation chase|transformation]] is found throughout [[Europe]] in [[folktale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 336-7, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

The story has been adapted into various stories, songs and films.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Carterhaugh.jpg|thumb|Carterhaugh, near the confluence of the [[Yarrow Water]] and the [[Ettrick Water]]]]
Most variants begin with the warning that Tam Lin collects either a possession or the [[virginity]] of any maidens who pass through the forest of [[Carterhaugh]]. A young maiden, usually called Janet or Margaret, comes to Carterhaugh and plucks a double rose, whereupon Tam appears and asked why she is in Carterhaugh without his command and has taken what is his. She states that she owns Carterhaugh, because her father has given it to her.

In most variants, she then goes home and discovers that she is pregnant; some variants pick up the story at this point.  When an old [[knight]] taxes her with it, she announces that she will not declare him her baby's father, that her lover is an [[elf]] and that she loves him.  She returns to Carterhaugh. In some variants, her brother has told her that a herb growing there will induce an abortion.  In all, she picks something, whether the herb or the same roses as when they first met.  Tam reappears, enraged, and forbids her to abort.

She asks him whether he was ever human, either after that reappearance, or in some variants, immediately after their first meeting resulted in her seduction.  He reveals that he was a mortal man, who, after falling from his horse, was rescued and captured by the Queen of the Fairies.  Every seven years, the fairies pay a [[teind]], a [[tithe]] to [[Hell]], of one of their people, and Tam fears he will become that tithe on that night ([[Halloween|Hallowe'en]]). He is to ride as part of a company of knights, and Janet will recognise him by the white horse upon which he is riding. He warns her that, when she catches him, the fairies will attempt to make her drop him by [[Shapeshifting#Transformation chase|turning him]] into all manner of beasts (see [[Proteus]]), but that he will do her no harm, and when he is finally turned into a burning coal she is to throw him into a well, whereupon he will reappear as a naked man and she should hide him. Janet does as she is asked, and wins her knight. The Queen of the Fairies is not best pleased, but acknowledges her claim.

In different variations, Tam Lin is reportedly the grandson of The Laird of Roxburgh, the Laird of Foulis, the Earl of Forbes or the Earl of Murray. His name also varies between versions (Tam Lin being the most common) as Tom Line, Tomlin, Young Tambling, and Tam-a-line.

==Versions==
The first recorded version of the song appears in the 1549 book &quot;[[The Complaynt of Scotland]]&quot;.

There have been several interpretations of the Tam Lin story:
*[[Francis James Child]] collected fourteen variants in ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'',&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''English and Scottish Popular Ballads, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/child/ch039.htm &quot;Tam Lin&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; but the summary of [[Child Ballad]] 39A is considered to be the earliest{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} (Another Child ballad, ''[[Burd Ellen and Young Tamlane]]'' has no connection with this ballad except for the similarity of the heroes' names.)
*[[Joseph Jacobs]] included a variant, &quot;Tamlane&quot;, in ''More English Fairy Tales''.&lt;ref name=JacobsMore/&gt;

==Motifs==
Child took the threat to take out Tam Lin's eyes as a common [[Scottish folklore|folklore]] precaution against mortals who could see fairies, in the tales of [[fairy ointment]].  [[Joseph Jacobs]] interpreted it as rather a reversal of the usual practice; the Queen of Faerie would have kept him from seeing the human woman who rescued him.&lt;ref name=JacobsMore/&gt;

In some variants, &quot;[[Hind Etin]]&quot; has verses identical to this for the first meeting between the hero and heroine.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 340, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also versions which change the original story. &quot;Tam Lyn retold&quot; by [[Benjamin Zephaniah]] &amp; [[Eliza Carthy]] (on the 2007 album [[The Imagined Village]]) retells the story with the girl meeting a man in a club and having a one night stand. 6 months later she finds him to say she's pregnant and finds out he's an immigrant without a valid visa and has a court case the following day. She attends the court and sees him go though various transformations before becoming himself: a kind peaceful person.  The judge sees this and lets him become a legal citizen, free to bring up his child with his wife. &quot;Discovery&quot; by [[Three Weird Sisters (band)|Three Weird Sisters]] hints at a darker Tam Lin with ulterior motives for his seduction of the girl.

===Other musical uses===
As well as these versions, the name has also been used as the [[stage name]] of a  New York City-based singer-songwriter, an LP by [[Frankie Armstrong]], [[Brian Pearson]], [[Blowzabella]] and [[Jon Gillaspie]], and for the title of an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Irish dance|reel]].

===Film===
*''[[Tam-Lin (film)|Tam-Lin]]'' (1970) directed by [[Roddy McDowall]], and starring [[Ava Gardner]].

===Other===
* ''Tam-Lin'', a [[Closet drama]] written by [[Elaine Lee]] and illustrated  by [[Charles Vess]], in ''The Book of Ballads and Sagas'', Vess's collection of adaptations of traditional songs, mostly into [[comics]] form.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Indiana is a text book rental state. Every completed open text book that can beat out the commercial competition is an immediate tax cut for Indiana families with children in school. I believe that if every school district notified parents about these potential savings when they're writing their yearly textbook fee checks, free and open text books would quickly improve and become the dominant force in the text book rental states.</text>

&lt;u&gt;'''Ethics'''&lt;/u&gt;: According to The American Heritage Dictionary ethics is a principal of right or good conduct or a body of such principals. 2 A system of moral principals or values. 3 The rules or standards governing the conduct of the members of a profession. 


Aristotle refers to ethics that the subject matter in ethics is practical choice, character, and action. Ethics is a practical art; it is better not to call it a science. It is more like navigation than astronomy. It aims at wisdom about what to do and how to live. We always act in some particular situation or other, so ethics must pay attention to particulars as well as universals. Therefore, we “must be content with indicating the truth in broad, general outline” and look only “for precision as the nature of the subject allows”


G.W.F. Hegel says the reason must become ethics. Hegel says morality must be found in reason, not desire. Reason, moreover, gives us universal laws telling us what our duties are. And to do one’s duty is to act in a way that is both autonomous and free. 

The stage of morality is supplanted by what Hegel calls ethics. Ethics is the next dialectical step in the objectification of spirit. What is required for spirit to become what is – fully rational, self conscious, and free – is for it to be able to recognize itself in its cultural expressions. So the next step, ethics, is the recognition of rationality in institutions – in property, contracts, the family, and the state. Spirit alienated from its products by setting itself apart from them, must reappropriate them, see itself in them, express itself in the social dimension – but now critically, rationally, freely. 

For Hegel, ethics is virtually indistinguishable from social and political philosophy. Or rather, it is not philosophy at all, but the realization of philosophy in an actual community. As he says, “the system of right is the realm of freedom made actual, the world of mind brought forth out of itself like a second nature”. For Hegel an individual must be thought of as socially shaped and constructed. The relation between an individual and the community is more like that between a leg and the body it belongs to. If the leg were to say, “I am an independent entity, and I will go my own way”, this would be manifestly absurd. It is no less absurd for individuals to consider themselves distinct from the community that nourishes, educates, shapes and form them. Indeed, an individual per se is an abstraction from the whole. As separate from the community, a person lacks reality. It is the community, which Hegel calls the State, that is the bearer of the objective reality of spirit and as such is “higher” than the individual. 




&lt;u&gt;'''Ethics for IT Professionals'''&lt;/u&gt;: Companies can take several of the following actions when creating an IT usage policy:
Establishing Guidelines for Use of Company Software – Company IT managers must provide clear rules that govern the use of home computers and associated software.  Some companies negotiate contracts with software manufacturers and provide PCs and software so that IT users can work at home. Other companies help employees buy hardware and software at corporate discount rates. The goal should be to ensure that employees have legal copies of all the software they need to be effective, regardless of whether they work in an office, on the road, or at home.


''Defining and Limiting the Appropriate USE of IT Resources'' – Companies must develop, communicate, and enforce written guidelines that encourage employees to respect corporate IT resource and use them to enhance their job performance. Effective guidelines allow some level of personal use while prohibiting employees from visiting objectionable Internet sites or using company email to send offensive or harassing message. 


''Structuring Information Systems to Protect Data and Information'' – Organization must implement systems and procedures that limit data access to just those employees who need it. For example, sales managers may have total access to sales and promotion database through a company network, but their access should be limited to products for which they are responsible. Furthermore, they should be prohibited from accessing data about research and development results, products formulas, and staffing projection if they don’t need it to do their jobs.


''Installing and Maintaining a Corporate Firewall'' – A firewall is hardware or software device that serves as a barrier between an organization’s network and the internet; a firewall also limits access to the company’s network based on the organization’s internet usage policy. The firewall can be configure to serve as an effective deterrent to unauthorized web surfing by blocking access to specific objectionable websites. The fire wall can also serve as an effective barrier to incoming email from certain websites, companies, or users. It can even be programmed to block email with certain kinds of attachment, which reduces the risk of harmful computer viruses. 




&lt;u&gt;'''Computer and Internet Crime'''&lt;/u&gt;: In today’s computing environment of increasing complexity, higher user expectations, expanding and exchanging systems, and increased reliance on software with known vulnerabilities, it is why the number, variety, and impact of security incident are increasing dramatically.
 

''Increasing Complexity Increases Vulnerability'' – The computing environment has become enormously complex. Networks, computers, operating systems, applications, websites, switches, routers, and gateways are interconnected and driven by hundreds of millions of line codes. This environment continues to increase in complexity every day. The number of possible entry points to a network expands continually as more devices are added, increasing the possibility of security breaches.


''Higher Computer User Expectations'' – Today, time means money, and the faster computer users can solve a problem, the sooner they can be productive. As a result, computer desk are under intense pressure to respond very quickly to user’s questions. Under duress, help desk personnel sometimes forget to verify user’s identities or to check whether they are authorized to perform a requested action. In addition, even though they have been warned against doing so, some computer users share their login ID and password with other coworkers who have forgotten their own passwords. This can enable workers to gain access to information systems and data for which they are not authorized.


''Expanding and Changing Systems Introduce New Risks'' – Business has moved from an era of stand-alone computers, in which critical data was stored on an isolated mainframe computer in a locked room, to an era in which personal computers connect to networks with millions of other computers, all capable of sharing information. Business have moved quickly into ecommerce, mobile computing, collaborative work groups, global business, and interorganizational information systems. Information technology has become ubiquitous and is a necessary tool for organizations to achieve their goals. However, it is increasingly difficult to keep up with the peace of technology change, successfully perform an ongoing assessment of new security risks, and implement approaches for dealing with them. 


''Increasing Reliance on Commercial Software with Known Vulnerabilities'' – In computing, an exploit is an attack on an information system that takes advantage of a particular system vulnerability. Often this attack is due to poor system design or implementation. Once the vulnerability is discovered, software developers quickly create and issue a fix or patch, to eliminate the problem. Any delay in installing the patch exposes the user to a security breach. 


There are many types of exploits use is internet crime. These exploits are not limited just to computers but to smart-phones, iPods, and Blackberry. Some types of exploit are:

''Viruses'' – is a piece of programming code, usually disguised as something else, that causes a computer to behave in an unexpected and usually undesirable manner.
 
''Worms'' - is a harmful program that resides in the active memory of the computer and duplicates itself.
 
''Trojan horse'' – is a program in which malicious code is hidden inside a seemingly harmless program.

''Logic Bomb'' – is another type of Trojan horse which executes when is triggered by a specific event.

''Botnet'' – is a large group of computers controlled from one or more remote locations by hackers, without knowledge or consent of their owners.

''Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks'' – is one in which a malicious hacker takes over computers on the internet and causes them to flood a target site with demands for data and other small tasks. 

''Rootkit'' -  is a set of programs that enables its user to gain administrator level access to a computer without the end user’s consent or knowledge. Once installed, the attacker can gain full control of the system and even obscure the presence of the rootkit from legitimate system administrators.

''Spam'' – is the abuse of email systems to send unsolicited email to large numbers of people. Spam can also be used to deliver harmful worms or other malware.

''Phishing'' – is the act of using email fraudulently to try to get the recipient to reveal personal data. 



'''&lt;u&gt;Privacy&lt;/u&gt;''': According to The American Heritage Dictionary 1. Privacy is the condition of being secluded from others. 2. Secrecy.

The right to privacy was added in the Fourth Amendment when debates on the adoption of the United States Constitution, some of the drafters expressed concern that a powerful government would intrude on the privacy of individual citizens. 

After the constitution when into effect in 1789, several amendments were proposed that would spell out the rights of individuals. Ten of these proposed amendments were ultimately ratified and became known as the Bill of Rights.
The Supreme Court has stated that American citizens are protected by the Fourth Amendment when there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.
 
&lt;u&gt;Amendment IV&lt;/u&gt;: The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violates, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. 

''Information Privacy'' – A broad definition of the right of privacy is “the right to be left alone – the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by free people” Another concept of privacy that is particularly useful in discussing the impact of IT on privacy is the term information privacy is the combination of communication privacy (the ability to communicate with others without those communications being monitored by other persons or organizations) and data privacy ( the ability to limit access to one’s personal data by other individuals and organizations in order to exercise a substantial degree of control over that data and its use)
 
There are several legislative acts passed over the past of 40 years that affect a person’s privacy. However, most of these actions address invasion of privacy by the government, legislation that protects people from data privacy abuses by corporations is almost nonexistent.


&lt;u&gt;Financial Data Privacy Acts&lt;/u&gt;:

''Fair Credit Reporting Act (1970)'' – Regulates the operations of credit-reporting bureaus, including how they collect, store, and use credit information.

''Gramm-leach-Bliley Act (1999)'' – Known as the Financial Service Modernization Glass-Steagall. Glass-Steagall prohibited any one institution from offering investment, commercial banking, and insurance services; individuals companies were only allowed to offer one of those types of financial service products. GLBA enable such entities to merge. 
GLBA alos included three hey rules that affect personal privacy: Financial Privacy Rule, Safeguards Rules, Pretexting Rule.


&lt;u&gt;Health Privacy Act&lt;/u&gt;:

''Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996'' – was designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage; to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in health insurance and healthcare delivery; and to simplify the administration of health insurance.


&lt;u&gt;Children’s Privacy Act&lt;/u&gt;:

''Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (1998)'' – any website that caters to children must offer comprehensive privacy policies, notify parents or guardians about its data—collection practices, and receive parental consent before collecting any personal information from children under 13 years of age. COPPA is meant to give parents control over the collection, use, and disclosure  of their children’s personal information; it does not cover the dissemination of information to children.


&lt;u&gt;Electronic Surveillance&lt;/u&gt;:

''Communication Act of 1934'' – established the Federal communication Commission broad and gave it responsibility for regulating all non-federal-government use of radio and television broadcasting and all interstate telecommunication – including wire, satellite, and cable- as well as all international communications that originate or terminate in the United States. 

''Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act (1968, amended 1986)'' – Also known as the Wiretap Act, regulates the interception of wire (telephone) and oral communications. It allows states and federal law enforcement officials to use wiretapping an electronic eavesdropping, but only under strict limitations.

''Foreign Intelligence surveillance Act (1978)'' – describes procedures for the electronic surveillance and collection of foreign intelligence information in communications between foreign powers and the agents of foreign powers.

''Electronic Communications Privacy Act (1986)'' – deals with three main issues: 1) the protection of communication while in transfer from sender to receiver. 2) the protection of communication held in electronic storage. 3) the prohibition of devices to record dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information without a search warrant. 

''Communications Assistance for Law enforcement Act (1994)'' – was passed by Congress in 1994 and amend both the Wiretap Act and ECPA . CALEA was a hotly debated law because it required the telecommunication industry to build tools into its products that deferral investigators could use after obtaining a court order to eavesdrop on conversations and intercept electronic communications.

''USA Patriot ACT (2001)'' – was passed just after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. It gave sweeping new powers both to domestic law enforcement and international intelligence agencies, including increasing the ability of law enforcement agencies to search telephone, email, medical, financial, and other records.


&lt;u&gt;Export of Personal Data&lt;/u&gt;:

''Organizations for economic Co-operation and Development Fair Information Practices (1980)'' – Another agency concerned with privacy is the OECD, and international organization consisting of 30 member countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, new Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Its goal is to set policy and come to agreement on topics for which multilateral consensus is necessary for individual countries to make progress in a global economy.

''European Union Data Protection Directive (1998)'' – requires any company doing business within the borders of 15 western European nations to implement a set of privacy directives on the fair and appropriate use of information. Basically, this directive requires member countries to ensure that data transferred to non-European Union countries is protected. 


&lt;u&gt;Access to Government Records&lt;/u&gt;:

''Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (1966 amended 1974)'' – passed in 1996 and amended in 1974, grants citizens the right to access certain information and records of the federal government upon request. 

''Privacy Act of 1974'' – prohibits US governments from concealing the existence of any personal data record keeping system. Under this law, any agency that maintains such a system must publicly describe both the kinds of information in it and the manner in which the information will be used. The CIA and law enforcement agencies are excluded from this act; in addition, it does not cover the actions of private industry. 




&lt;u&gt;'''Freedom of Expression'''&lt;/u&gt;: The First Amendment protects American’s rights to freedom of religion and freedom of expression. This amendment has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as applying to the entire federal government, even though it only expressly refers to Congress.

&lt;u&gt;Amendment I&lt;/u&gt;: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for redress of grievances.

Numerous court decisions have broadened the definition of speech to include nonverbal, visual and symbolic forms of expression, such as flag burning, dance movements, and hand gestures. Sometimes the speech at issue is unpopular or highly offensive to a majority of people; however, the Bill of Rights provides protection for minority views. The Supreme Court has also ruled that the First Amendment protects the right to speak anonymously as part of the guarantee of free speech.

The Supreme Court has held that the following types of speech are not protected by the First Amendment and may be forbidden by the government: perjury, fraud, defamation, obscene speech, incitement of panic, incitement to crime, “fighting words”, and sedition (incitement of discontent or rebellion against a government). 

Two of these types of speech – obscene speech and defamation – are particularly relevant to information technology.


&lt;u&gt;Freedom of expression: Key Issues&lt;/u&gt;
There are clear and convincing arguments to support freedom of speech online, the issue is complicated by the ease with which children can access the Internet. Even some advocates of free speech acknowledge the need to restrict children’s Internet access, but it is difficult to restrict their access without also restricting adult’s access

The US government has passed laws, and software manufacturers have invented special software to block access to objectionable material.

''Communication Decency Act (1996)'' - Its purpose was to allow freer competition among phone, cable, and TV companies. Embedded d in the telecommunications Act was the CDA, aimed at protecting children from pornography.

''Child Online Protection Act (1998)'' – The law states that “whoever knowingly and with knowledge of the character of the material, in interstate or foreign commerce by means of the World Wide Web, makes any communication for commercial purposes that is available to any minor that includes any material that is harmful to minors shall be fined not more than $50,000 imprisoned not more than six months, or both. 

''Internet Filtering'' – Is software that can be used to block access to certain Websites that contain material deemed inappropriate or offensive. The best internet filtering uses a combination of URL, keywords, and dynamic content filtering.

''Children’s Internet Protection Act (2000)'' – The act required federally financed schools and libraries to use some form of technological protection to block computer access to obscene material, pornography, and anything else considered harmful to minors.




&lt;u&gt;'''Intellectual Property'''&lt;/u&gt;: Is a term used to describe works of the mind -such as art, books, films, formulas, inventions, music, and processes- that are distinct, and owned or crested by a single person or group. Intellectual property is protected through copyright, patent, and trade secret laws. 

Copyright law protects authored works such as art, books, and music.

Patent law protects invention.

Trade secret laws helps safeguard information that is critical to an organization’s success. 

Together, copyright, patent, and trade secret legislation forms a complex body of law that addresses the ownership of intellectual property. 


''A Copyright'' – is the exclusive right to distribute, display, perform, or reproduce an original work in copies or to prepare derivative works based on the work. Copyright protection is granted to the creators of original works of authorship in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly  or with the aid of a machine device.

''A Patent'' – Is a  grant of a property right issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to an inventor. A patent permits its owner to exclude the public from making, using, or selling a protected invention, and it allows for legal actions against violators. Unlike copyright, a patent prevents independent creations as well as copying. 

''Trade Secrets'' – Trade secret protection begins by identifying all the information that must be protected from undisclosed patent application to market research and business plans, and developing a comprehensive strategy for keeping the information secure. 
Trade secret laws protects only against the misappropriation of trade secrets.


&lt;u&gt;Key Intellectual Properties Issues&lt;/u&gt; – There are several issues with intellectual property such as plagiarism, reverse engineering, open source code, competitive intelligence, and cybersquating.

''Plagiarism'' – Is the act of stealing someone’s ideas or words and passing them off as one’s own.

''Reverse Engineering'' – Is the process of taking something apart in order to understand it, build a copy of it, or improve it.

''Open Source Code'' – Is any program whose source code is made available for use or modification, as users or other developers see fit. The basic premise behind open source code is that when many programmers can read, redistribute, and modify a program’s code, the software improves. Programs with open source code can be adaptable to meet new needs, and bugs can be rapidly identify and fixed.
 
''Competitive Intelligence'' – Is legally obtained information that is gathered to help a company gain an advantage over its rivals.

''Cybersquatting'' – Registered domain names for famous trademarks or company names to which they had no connection, with the people that the trademark’s owner would eventually buy the domain name for a large sum of money. 




&lt;u&gt;'''Software Development'''&lt;/u&gt;: High quality software systems are easy to learn and use because they perform quickly and efficiently; they meet their user’s needs; and they operate safely and reliably so that systems downtime is kept to a minimum. Such software has long been required to support the fields of air traffic control, nuclear power, automobile safety, health care, military and defense, and space exploration.
 
Now that computers and software have become integral parts of almost every business, the demand for high quality software is increasing. End user cannot afford system crashes, lost work, or lower productivity, nor can they tolerate security holes through which intruders can spread viruses, steal data, or shut down Websites. 

Software manufacturers face economic, ethical, and organizations challenges associated with improving the quality of their software. 


''Software Quality'' – is the degree to which a software product meets the needs of its users.

''Quality management'' - focuses on defining, measuring, and refining the quality of the development process and the products developed during its various stages. These products including statements of requirements, flowcharts, and user documentation, are known as deliverables. 


&lt;u&gt;Software Development Process&lt;/u&gt; – Developing information system software is not simple process; it requires completing many complex activities, with many dependencies among the various activities. System analyst, programmers, architects, database specialists, trainers, and testers are all involved in large software projects. Each of these groups has a role to play, and has specific responsibilities and tasks. In addition, each group makes decisions that can affect the software’s quality and the ability of an organization or an individual to use it effectively.
 
''Software development methodology'' - is a standard, proven work process that enables systems analysts, programmers, projects managers, and others to make controlled and orderly progress in developing high-quality software. A methodology defines activities in the software development process, and the individual and group responsibilities for accomplishing these activities. It also recommends specific techniques for accomplishing the various activities, such as using a flowchart to document the logic of a computer program. A methodology offers guidelines for managing the quality of software during the various stages of development. 

''Quality assurance (QA'') - refers to methods within the development cycle design to guarantee reliable operation of the product. Ideally, these methods are applied at each stage of the development cycle. 

Several types of tests are used in software development.

&lt;u&gt;Dynamic Software Testing&lt;/u&gt; – Software is developed in units called subroutines or programs. These units, in turn, are combined to form large systems. One approach to QA is to test the code for a completed unit of software by actually entering test data and comparing the results to the expected results. This is called Dynamic testing. There are two forms of dynamic testing:

* Black-box testing – involves viewing the software unit as a device that has expected input and output behaviors but whose internal working are unknown (a black box)

* White-box testing – treats the software unit as a device that has expected input and output behaviors but whose internal workings, unlike the unit in black-box testing, are known. 

''Others types of Software Testing''
* Static testing – Special software programs called static analyzers are run against the new code. Rather than reviewing input and output, the static analyzer looks for suspicious patterns in programs that might indicate a defect.

* Integration testing – After successful unit testing, the software units are combined into an integrated subsystem that undergoes rigorous testing to ensure that the linkage among the various subsystems work successfully.

* User acceptance testing – Independent testing performed by trained end users to ensure that the system operates as they expect. 





'''&lt;u&gt;The Impact of Information Technology on the Quality of Life'''&lt;/u&gt;: Industrialized nations tend to have a higher standard of living than developing countries. In the United States and in most developed countries, the standard of living has been improving over time. However, its rate varies as a result of business cycles that affect prices, wages, employment levels, and the production of goods and services.

&lt;u&gt;IT Investment and Productivity&lt;/u&gt;

''Productivity'' – is defined as the amount of output produced per unit of input, and it is measured in many different ways. Innovation is a key factor in productivity improvement, and IT has played an important role in enabling innovation. Progressive management teams use IT, as well as other new technology and capital investment, to implement innovations in products, processes, and services. 

''Telework'' – also known as telecommuting, is a work from home arrangement in which an employee works away from the office, - at home, at a client’s office, in a hotel- literally, anywhere. 

''The Digital Divide'' – is another indicator of the standard of living is the availability of technology. The digital divide is a term used to describe the gulf between those who do and those who don’t have access to modern information and communications technology such as cell phones, personal computers, and the internet. 

''E-Rate Program'' – was created through the Telecommunications Act 1996. One of E-Rate’s goal is to help schools and libraries obtain access to state of the art services and technologies at discount rates.

''Ed-tech Program'' – The goal of No Child left Behind Act which was signed into law in 2002, is to end the achievement gap between rich and poor students and between white and minority students, while improving the academic performance of all students. Recognizing that the ability to use computers and access the Internet is a requirement for succeeding in the US educational system and the global workforce, NCLB requires each state to have an Enhancing Education Through Technology program. 




&lt;u&gt;'''Social Networking'''&lt;/u&gt;: A social networking website is a site whose purpose is to create an online community of internet users that enables members to break down barriers created by time, distance, and cultural differences. 

Social networking Websites allow people to interact with others online by sharing opinions, insights, information, interest, and experiences. Members of an online social network may use the site to interact with friends, family members, and colleagues, but they may also wish to develop new personal and professional relationships. 

''Social Networking Advertising'' – involves the use of social networks to inform, promote, and communicate the benefits of products and services. 

''Vital Marketing'' – encourages individuals to pass along a marketing message to others, thus creating the potential for exponential growth in the message’s exposure and influence as one person tells two people, each of those two people tell two or three more people and so on.

''The Use of Social Networks in the Hiring Process'' – Employers can and do look at the social networking profiles of job candidates when making hiring decision. According to a recent survey by CareerBuilder.com, 22 percent of hiring managers use social networking Websites as a source of information about candidates, and additional 9 percent are planning to do so.

''Social Shopping Websites'' – brings shoppers and sellers together in a social networking environment online. Thus, these sites combine two highly popular online activities –shopping and social networking. 

&lt;u&gt;Social Networking Ethical Issues&lt;/u&gt; – Some of the common ethical issues that arise for members of social networking websites are cyberbullying, cyberstalking, encounters with sexual predators, and uploading of inappropriate material. 

''Cyberbullying'' – is the harassment, torment, humiliation, or threatening of one minor by another minor or group of minors via the internet or cell phone. 

''Cyberstalking'' – is threatening behavior or unwanted advances directed at an adult using the internet or other forms of online and electronic communications; it is the adult version of cyberbulling. Online stalking can be a serious problem for victims, terrifying them and causing mental anguish.

''Encounter with Sexual Predators'' – Some social networking webites have been critized for not doing enough to protect minors from encounters with sexual predators. Almost one hundred thousand convicted sex offenders mixing with children on MySpace…is absolutely appalling and totally unacceptable, stated Attorney General Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who is pishing networking websites to adopt stronger safety measures. 




&lt;u&gt;'''Ethics of IT Organizations'''&lt;/u&gt;: Facing a likely long-term shortage of trained and experienced workers, employers are increasingly turning to nontraditional sources to find IT workers with skills that meet their needs; these sources include contingent workers, H-1B workers, and outsourced offshore workers. Employers face ethical decisions about whether to recruit new and more skilled workers from these sources or to develop their own staff to meet the needs of their business.

''Contingent work'' – is a job situation in which an individual does not have an explicit or implicit contract for long term employment. The contingent workforce includes independent contractors, temporary workers hired through employment agencies, on-call or day labors, and on-site workers whose services are provided by contract firms.

A firm is likely to use contingent IT workers if it experiences pronounced fluctuations in its technical staffing needs. Workers are often hired on a contingent basis as consultants on an organizational restructuring project, as technical experts on a product development team, and as supplemental staff for many other short-term projects.

''H-1B Workers'' – is a temporary work visa granted by the US Citizen and Immigration Services for people who work in specialty occupations. Many companies turn to H-1B workers to meet critical business needs or to obtain essential technical skills and knowledge that cannot be readily found in the United States.

''Outsourcing'' – is a long term business arrangement in which a company contracts for services with an outside organization that has expertise in providing a specific function.
Coemployment legal problems with outsourcing are minimal, because the company that contracts for the services does not generally supervise or control the contractor’s employees. The primary rationale for outsourcing is lower cost, but companies also use it to obtain strategic flexibility and to keep their staff focused on the company’s core competencies.

''Offshore Outsourcing'' – is a form of outsourcing in which the services are provided by and organization whose employees are in a foreign country. Any work done at a relatively high cost in the United States may become a candidate for offshore outsourcing.

''Whistle-Blowing'' – Like the subject of contingent workers, whistle- blowing is a significant topic in any discussion of ethics in IT. Both issues raise ethical questions and have social and economic implication. 

''Whistle-blowing'' – is an effort to attract public attention to a negligent, illegal, unethical, abusive, or dangerous act by a company or some other organization. It is an important ethical issue for individuals and organizations. How does one safely and effectively report misconduct, and how should managers handle a whistle-blowing incident?

''Protection for Whistle-Blowers'' – Whistle-blower protection laws allow employees to alert the proper authorities to employer action that are unethical, illegal, or unsafe, or that violate specific policies. Unfortunately, no comprehensive federal law protects all whistle-blowers from retaliators acts. Instead, numerous laws protect a certain class of specific whistle-blowing acts in various industries.

''Green Computing'' – many computer manufacturers today are talking about building a “green PC” by which they usually mean one that uses less electricity to run than the standard computer; thus, its carbon footprint on the planet is smaller. However, to manufacturer a truly green PC, hardware companies must also reduce the amount of hazardous materials used and dramatically increase the amount of reusable or recyclable materials used. The manufacturers must also help consumers dispose of their product in an environmentally safe manner at the end of their useful life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cultural Imperialism: Class Research Virtual Activity ==

== Unit Summary ==
A class of pre-service [[w:Social studies|social studies]] [[w:Teacher|educators]] at the [[w:University of Iowa|University of Iowa]] engaged in an activity of exploratory inquiry. The topic was [[w:Cultural imperialism|cultural imperialism]]. The students were divided into groups and were responsible for engaging in Internet research, gathering data, siting sources, and synthesizing their findings into an argument. Afterwards, the class integrated each groups work into a WikiBook page about cultural imperialism.

== Unit Rationale ==
Social studies students engaged in collaborative learning and reflective inquiry, via the Internet, to find digital resources. They collaborate in a virtual environment and create a functional learning product to showcase their learning experience.

== Student Benefit from Technological Integration ==
* Students gained access to a greater quantity and quality of data online
* Students learned by engaging in research vs. reading from a textbook
* Students taught and learned from each other by presenting research in virtual space
* Students collaboratively engaged in reflective inquiry as opposed to sat passively in their seats
* Students were were assessed by the product of their learning
* Students made a meaningful contribution to the online scholarly community.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Soldier's Joy is  a fiddle tune, classified as a reel or country dance.&lt;ref&gt;ref name= LOC|Library of Congress|American Memory|Soldier's Joy An American Classic|https://archive.is/20121213090237/lcweb2.loc.gov/afc/afccc/soldiersjoy/&lt;/ref&gt; It is popular in the American fiddle canon,  in which it is touted as &quot;an American classic&quot; &lt;ref&gt; LOC &lt;/ref&gt; but traces its origin to Scottish fiddling traditions. &lt;ref&gt;ref name=Learn Scot|http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/scotlandssongs/earlyyears/soldiersjoy.asp&lt;/ref&gt; and Irish fiddle traditions. It has been played in Scotland for over 200 years and Robert Burns used it for the first song of his cantata 'The Jolly Beggars'.According to documentation at the United States Library of Congress, &lt;ref&gt;Library odf Congress American Memory|http://memory.loc.gov&lt;/ref&gt; it is &quot;one of the oldest and most widely distributed tunes&quot; &lt;ref&gt;https://archive.is/20121213090237/lcweb2.loc.gov/afc/afccc/soldiersjoy/&lt;/ref&gt;and is rated in the top ten most-played Old Time Fiddle tune and is dancable. According to the Illinois Humanities Center, the tune dates as early as the 1760s. &lt;ref&gt;ref name= IHC|Soldier's Joy&quot;|Performed by Mr. Charles Wright|Recorded by Professor McIntosh|August 1954 |url=http://www.prairie.org/humanities-resources/kiosk-online-exhibit/fiddle-tunes-quot-jennie-jenkins-quot-and-quot-soldier-039&lt;/ref&gt;
In spite of its upbeat tempo and catchy melody, the term &quot;soldier's joy&quot; has a much darker meaning than is portrayed by the tune. Opinion has it that this term eventually came to refer to the combination of whiskey, beer, and morphine used by Civil War soldiers, presumably for pain relief. As the lyrics state:

==Melody as basis for song==

Like many pure tunes with ancient pedigree, the melody of Soldier's Joy has been used as a basis for construction of [[song]]s, which, unlike pure tunes, have lyrics.
===Civil War era and post-bellum cultural references===

According to the Illinois Humanities Council (IHC), the tune came to represent substance abuse during the Civil War. This is corroborated in concurring secondary sources.

Gimme some of that Soldier’s Joy, you know what I mean

I don’t want to hurt no more my leg is turnin’ green&lt;ref&gt;http://www.countryfriends.dk/us/soldiers-joy-1864.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Skillet Lickers&lt;/ref&gt;

The IHIC version is as follows:


Twenty-five cents for whiskey, twenty-five cents for beer

Twenty-five cents for morphine, get me out of here.

Chorus: I'm my momma's pride and joy

I'm my momma's pride and joy

I'm my momma's pride and joy

Sing you a song called the soldier's joy.

===Country ===
Twenty five cents for whiskey, 25 cents for beer
Twenty five cents for morphine get me out of here

cho:      I'm my momma's pride and joy (3X)

Sing you a song called the soldier's joy

Grasshopper sitting on a sweet potato vine (3X)

Along come a chicken and he's say your mine.

I'm gonna get you there don't you want to go (3X)
All for the soldoer's joy

Chicken in a bread pan scratching that dough

Granny does your dog bite no child no

Etcetera''&lt;ref&gt;ref name=Skillet Lickers|&quot;The Skillet Lickers were very influential in the 1920s-30s building the bridge that connected Appalachian folk music to modern popular music and gave respectability to the formerly ridiculed &quot;hillbilly&quot; music. &quot;-Liner note posted by preservationhall01|Postged May 1, 2009|Other lyrics are &quot;25 cents for the morphine that will take me away from here&quot;|Gid Tanner &amp; The Skillet Lickers-Soldiers Joy-1929(w/film clip)|http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p952jSLddg&amp;feature=fvst&lt;/ref&gt;

== View point ==
Sorry if I messed up the project a bit. I noticed the first edit on the subject on your project and after looking around found the same type of issue with the [[Cultural Anthropology/Human Rights]] section on Cultural Imperialism. In any case thanks for the project you are creating and please consider the view point I presented.&lt;br&gt;
I also noticed that the project is centered mostly on American culture development a great location to find cultural clashes in American history is on the evolution of the states not only their relation with the Indian Nations but for instance the overlap that occurred between previously  territories occupied by the Spanish and French, the Porto Rico impact on the union and the still evolving aculturalization of Mexico and Canada in relation to the USA (and how they diverge) as well as the Jewish and Cuban immigration impact. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 18:24, 25 July 2011 (UTC)


: No worries. I'm glad you are policing for quality and adding/suggestion content. I really, really need to finish the preface to the wikibook so potential contributors can figure out what the heck this wikibook is even supposed to be about. The student-generated units (as of now just cultural imperialism unit that I have been expanding recently) are intended to supply data to potential contributors who know a lot about the main intent of the book (i.e. applying technology to classroom learning) but lack a class to implement the lessons. Teachers and various contributors can add social studies activities they have done in virtual space under the units section.I'm just getting ahead of myself by expanding the cultural anthropology section because I have data from an upcoming class to put up. My real focus is trying to develop the content under the &quot;Project Outline&quot; heading. I will probably use some of the data from that cultural anthropology unit to get the ball rolling on the development of the section on wikis. Thanks for your contributions, the more the merrier.--[[User:Vedalian|Vedalian]] ([[User talk:Vedalian|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Vedalian|contribs]]) 21:36, 25 July 2011 (UTC)Vedalian</text>

The [[w:Canvas element|canvas]] K3D [[w:JavaScript|JavaScript]] programming library supports points, wireframes and polygons with depth-cue shading, simple animation with motion blur and texture mapping with a basic lighting model in three dimensions using [[w:HTML5|HTML5]] graphics. It does not require [[w:WebGL|WebGL]] so it runs on most 2011 browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari, and many smartphones and tablets.  CanvasK3D is available under a [[w:BSD License|BSD-style license]], where the author asks for a link back to his site or a mention of his name.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Please [[Special:Emailuser/Jsalsman|email]] if you have questions or concerns. [[User:Jsalsman|Jsalsman]] ([[User talk:Jsalsman|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jsalsman|contribs]]) 01:04, 24 July 2011 (UTC)

== Textures Render Incorrectly When Object Is Rotated ==

Maybe it is a problem with my code and not the rendering functionality but I have generated a box with a texture on it. The texture is basically a even grid dividing the face into 9 squares.

When the box is rendered dead-on (i.e. angles are all 0, 90, 180 or 360) then the texture appears correct.

However, when the box is rotated to some odd angle (not a multiple of 0, 90, 180 or 360) the texture appears incorrect.

From what I can see, it seems that the face is rendered properly but then the texture is applied linearly not taking the 3D perspective of the face into account.

For example, if you are looking at one of the sides of the box dead-on then it appears as a square. As the box is rotated into the screen, the bottom edge appears to remain the same size but the top edge reduces in size giving the illusion that it is further away (into the screen) from the viewer. Thus the face becomes a trapazoid.

However, it appears that the texture on such a object does not do this. The texture seems to be applied as if the object was flat, using the smaller edge for scaling. The larger edge then uses more of the texture as necessary. This means that while the face has become a trapazoid, the texture has not.


Here is a link to a picture that shows the issues...

Are there any fixes for this planned?

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Fiddlin Bill Henseley, Mountain Fiddler, Asheville, North Carolina by Ben Shahn, 1937 (LOC) (290626613).jpg|thumb|]]
Yew Piney Mountain is part of the canonical Appalachian music tradition which has been highly influential in American fiddle tradition generally, including its old time fiddle and bluegrass fiddle branches. According to Alan Jabbour at The Digital Library of Appalachia, the tune was called at one time Blackberry Blossom (tune)|Blackberry Blossom until that title was taken over by a different tune. The earlier Blackberry Blossom, as played by Sanford Kelly from Morgan County,is what is now called Yew Piney Mountain. &lt;ref&gt; Note: As an E minor tune. He ends the tune &quot;that's the way that God made peace&quot;.|http://www.aca-dla.org/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/Berea43&amp;CISOPTR=3533&amp;filename=3534.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; which is now represented by the tune &quot;Yew Piney Mountain&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;ref name=Jabbour BBB Transcript|cited=Wikiversity Ethnography of Fiddle|Fiddle tune played by Alan Jabbour at Berea College on 5-28-08, while participating in Berea's Appalachian Music Fellowship Program.c; Jabbour, Alan; Blackberry Blossom;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Blackberry Blossom|Lecture and performance by Alan Jabbour|Madison County, Kentucky|Audio Compact Disc|On web Digital Library of Appallachia| Archives, Hutchins Library, Department of Special Collections &amp; Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Differing from Jabbour, however, another influential secondary source, Andrew Kuntz's ''Fiddler's Companion'' asserts that the tunes are related
&lt;ref&gt;ref name=Kuntz|The Fiddler’s Companion|Andrew Kuntz|1996[?]|Citing Jean Thomas's Ballad Makin' in the Mountains of Kentucky|http://www.ibiblio.org/fiddlers/BLACK.htm#BLACKBERRY_BLOSSOM_[2]&lt;/ref&gt; Contradicting Jabbour, who clearly distinguishes the earlier version, is the account of Andrew Kuntz to the effect that &quot;Betty Vornbrock and others have noted a similarity between 'Garfield’s Blackberry Blossom' and the West Virginia tune 'Yew Piney Mountain', a variant...also played by Kentucky fiddlers J.P. Fraley and and Santford Kelly&quot;. &lt;ref&gt; Kuntz&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture: History and Influence==

According to Andy Kurtz, similarities between an unspecified variant of Blackberry Blossom, which may be the different song identified by Jabbour as today's Yew Piney Mountain, were acknowledged in the literature. &lt;ref&gt; Kurtz |&quot;Betty Vornbrock and others have noted a similarity between “Garfield’s Blackberry Blossom” and the West Virginia tune “Yew Piney Mountain [1],” a variant. &lt;/ref&gt; Whichever version that overlap refers to, it was reportedly also played by the well known Kentucky fiddler J.P. Fraley and the more obscure Owen “Snake” Chapman,  as well as by Santford Kelly and others. &lt;ref&gt;Kuntz|&quot;Jean Thomas recorded the tune for the Library of Congress in 1930 from fiddler Ed Morrison (Boyd County, Ky.) at the American Folk Song Festival (AFS 300A). Sources for notated versions: (Buddy Thomas (Ky.) [Phillips]; a home recording of Ed Haley (Ashland, Boyd County, Kentucky) by his son Ralph [Titon]; Scott Marckx [Silberberg]. Phillips (Traditional American Fiddle Tunes), vol. 1, 1994; pg. 27. Silberberg (Tunes I Learned at Tractor Tavern), 2002; pg. 11. Titon (Old Time Kentucky Fiddle Tunes), 2001; No. 10, pg. 43. &lt;/ref&gt; 


The tune is such a solid exemplar of Americana that it is the title of a radio show, &lt;ref&gt;“Yew Piney Mountain,” which airs on Wednesdays from 6-7  pm CST on KRUI, 89.7 FM in Iowa City, Iowa. url=http://yewpineymountain.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt;, serious blogging about Old Time fiddle music &lt;ref&gt;Notes from Yew Piney Mountain|A Blog About Old-Time Music||http://yewpineymountain.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and a Smithsonian Folkways compilation &lt;ref&gt;ref name=Yew Piney SF|title=Yew Piney Mountain|url=http://www.folkways.si.edu/TrackDetails.aspx?itemid=47195|Old-time fiddler Jake Krack and Folkways archivist Jeff Place compiled and annotated this collection of vintage Southern Appalachian string band music from the Smithsonian archive&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;In practice, however, Wikibooks takes a permissive stance by allowing specific types of contributions that, strictly speaking, could be considered original research.

Moreover, authors may add content based on repeatable information from their personal experiences or from common knowledge they have &quot;off the top of their heads.&quot; When adding unsourced information to Wikibooks, though, remember to avoid content that isn't well supported in subject literature, or that other contributors might reasonably disagree with unless you are prepared to defend.&quot;

* Respect for indigenous traditions is appropriate

This is not Wikipedia. Although we adhere to neutral point of view, a slavish adherence is not appropriate. This WikiBook follows professional standards of the field of ethnography and ethnomusicology which is consistent with Wikiversity's standard. WikiBooks strive for textbook quality and thus embrace academic standards; this means that &quot;neutrality&quot; as practiced here rejects points of view such as pseudoscience or Eurocentric chauvinism which suggests that the monoculture of Western Civilization as taught in the 1950's is superior and the only culture of interest. That is taken for granted in the field of Ethnomusicology and Ethnography except perhaps for fringe elements who are by definition not &quot;neutral&quot; even if, perhaps, in some ways they might be &quot;more correct&quot;. This book is NPOV within the scope of ethnographic studies, and parties who do not concur might wish to develop a new book expressing dissent from mainstream ethnic studies, which would probably be acceptable within WikiBooks but would not be acceptable for this book, which is not intended as a radical critique of mainstream ethnomusicological standards.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome!

Even though this is an almost-complete book, we invite your participation in growing this book by adding more information about more fiddle tunes. Banjo players are of course also welcome, along with mandolin, double bass, guitar, washboard, bazouki and other instrumentalists! But a fiddle tune is still considered to be a fiddle tune no matter what instrument it is played on. We hope you enjoy reading about your favorite Old Time tunes and better yet, adding lore of your own!

==If you wish to print==

A [[Bards_Old_Time_Fiddle_Tunebook_Supplement/Print_Version_1|printable version]] is in process and should be online by August 1 if not sooner. At present, it only has two songs!00:12, 23 July 2011 (UTC)

== Failed imports- evidence of attempts to fix this at Mediawiki ==

http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User_talk:Geofferybard#Edit_notices_on_Media_Wiki.3F

This just shows I racked my brain trying to import edit histories. Thus, my extended efforts to copy and past attribution, or at least link to attribution, should satisfy anyone, right?

== Subjects/Categories ==

For some reason I get a redlink at the bottom of Diablo book altho the Subject subsection populates the superordinate Subjects fine. Maybe it just takes a while.[

Very confusing. I see a category at:

[[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category:Environmental_law]] Category:Environmental_law

and at

[[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category:Nuclear_engineering]] Category:Nuclear engineering

but not at [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category:Political_activism]] Category:Political activism



===This just in===

During the elapsed time, the deleted category page has nevertheless populated with the book name, obviously because of the subject tag. But the red link is still red.
How bizarre!



====And so====

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the previous unit on service planning, the strategic decisions of network and route design, stop layout, and frequency determination were described. In this unit, the tactical decisions associated with creating a service schedule (timetabling), creating a schedule for vehicles to operate the service (vehicle scheduling), and creating work shifts for operators (crew scheduling) are presented. A practical guidebook and learning tool has been published recently.&lt;ref&gt;Transportation Research Board (2009a). Controlling System Costs: Basic and Advanced Scheduling Manuals and Contemporary Issues in Transit Scheduling, Transit Cooperative Research Program, Report 135. [http://www.trb.org/Publications/Blurbs/Controlling_System_Costs_Basic_and_Advanced_Schedu_161864.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivation for good solutions to these tactical decisions is to minimize the net operating costs to the agency. Once the timetable is determined, the number of vehicles required to be in revenue service can also be identified. When the vehicle schedule is determined, the total mileage and hours for the vehicle fleet are defined. Finally, when the crew schedule is determined, the total cost of labor (operators) is defined. Since these factors are the primary determinants of operating costs, finding efficient solutions has a direct effect on the bottom line.

In many cases, these tactical activities are assisted by software tools that can generate high quality solutions in a short period of time, often with direct interaction with the planner. As a result, the interested student may wish to consult other sources to identify and to investigate the specific software tools that might be available, such as those described in a recent publication.&lt;ref&gt;Transportation Research Board (2009b). Controlling System Costs: Basic and Advanced Scheduling Manuals and Contemporary Issues in Transit Scheduling, Appendix, Transit Cooperative Research Program, Report 135 Appendix. [http://www.trb.org/Publications/Blurbs/Appendixes_to_TCRP_Report_135_Controlling_System_C_161862.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timetabling ==

The general idea behind timetabling is to create a schedule for service. As inputs, one would consider the frequency of service for the given route (see previous unit) and the expected travel times between stops on the route. The latter could be determined either by historical experience or through estimates based on traffic conditions, vehicle acceleration and deceleration characteristics, expected dwell times, etc.

Let ''h'' be the selected headway for a route, perhaps for a specific time period of the day.

Let ''t&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the time between stop ''i'' and stop ''j'' along the route, where ''i'' and ''j'' are adjacent stops. The travel times between stops, ''t&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'', can vary by time of day, particularly as they may be affected by traffic conditions. They may also reflect any slack time built into the schedule between stops, to allow for possible variability in travel times.

Finally, let ''t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the dispatch time (departure time) of the first vehicle from a terminal.

Then, the timetable can be created simply using the following structure, with ''n'' stops on the route and ''k+1'' vehicles to dispatch:

[[File:Transit timetable.png|680px|Caption Timetable]]

The primary decision variable here is the initial dispatch time, ''t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''. Different operating conditions might lead to a number of possible choices for ''t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'':

* '''“Clockface” values'''. Passengers may remember the schedule more clearly if the dispatch times fall at easily recognized times on the clock. For example, with 15-minute headways, there may be value to passengers in dispatching a vehicle on the :00, :15, :30, and :45 of each hour.

* '''Coordination for improved vehicle scheduling'''. When a vehicle finishes its trip at a terminal, it will often be turned around to continue onto the next trip in the opposite direction on the route. In this case, there is a need for sufficient layover time at the terminal. If the vehicle finishes a trip at time ''t'', then completes the layover after an additional time ''t&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', then the vehicle may start its return trip after ''t'' + ''t&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''. Choosing the dispatch time to occur at or slightly after ''t'' + ''t&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' allows for higher vehicle utilization.

: One way of visualizing such a system uses a so-called “string diagram,” shown in this figure. The blue lines indicate the trajectory of a vehicle from the terminal at stop 1 to the terminal at stop ''n'', with short dwell times at each stop. Vehicles arriving at stop ''n'' then can return along the route in the opposite direction (the red lines), after a layover (indicated by the black arrows). These diagrams can be useful in visualizing vehicle movements and crosses along the route.

[[File:String diagram.png|600px|Caption String diagram of a single route timetable]]

* '''Coordination of passenger transfers'''. In some cases, it may be desirable to choose the dispatch time so that passengers may connect to other routes in the network without unduly long waiting times for the transfer route. To do this consistently across the timetable, the two (or more) routes that connect for the transfer must have the same headway h. If this is the case, then the initial dispatch time t0 can be chosen so that the vehicle’s arrival time at the transfer point matches that of the vehicle on the connecting route.

* '''Reduction of vehicle requirements'''. The timetable will dictate how many vehicles are in operation at any time of the day. In some cases, minor adjustments in the dispatch times, coupled with changes in layovers and/or dead-heads of vehicles between terminals can lead to a reduction in the number of vehicles needed for service.

== Vehicle scheduling ==

Vehicle scheduling, also called “blocking”, involves assigning vehicles to cover the trips associated with the timetable. A vehicle “block” is the schedule of travel of a vehicle for a given day, including: (1) a pull-out from the depot, (2) a sequence of trips from the timetable, (3) any dead-head trips, and (4) a pull-in back to the depot (recall the vehicle cycle from the unit on vehicle operations).

Generally, once the timetable is created, the time and mileage that vehicles spend in revenue service (i.e., completing the trips in the timetable) is fixed. So, the usual goal in vehicle scheduling is to minimize the time and/or distance that vehicles spend outside of revenue service: e.g., pull-ins, pull-outs, dead-heads, and layovers. These all represent time or mileage that are “unproductive”, and hence should be minimized. 

Constraints on this process include the following:

* Each trip in the timetable must be made by a vehicle.
* A vehicle cannot be assigned more than one trip at any point in time.
* If a vehicle must be re-positioned for a trip, the associated travel time and distance from its current position to the new position must be observed.

To solve for the vehicle schedule, one might consider a simple “first-in-first-out” rule. In this case, a vehicle stays on the same route throughout the whole period, and is always assigned to the next trip after a layover. The string diagram above gives just such an arrangement.

As a simple example, suppose we have a route that runs from terminal A to terminal B and then back to terminal A. Travel time from A to B and from B to A, including running and dwell time, is 30 minutes, and a minimum 5 minute layover is needed at each terminal. Headways are 15 minutes.

Below is a timetable for this situation, for trips between 6:00 am and after 9:00 am. The left-hand side of the timetable shows vehicle trips from A to B, while the right-hand side shows vehicle trips from B to A. 

[[File:Veh schedule.png|Caption Timetable and vehicle schedule]]

The colors correspond to different vehicles used on the route. The gray color corresponds to the first vehicle of the day, leaving A at 6:00 am and continuing with the trip from B at 6:40, the trip from A at 7:15, etc. A total of five vehicles are required to cover all the trips in this timetable.

In addition to the trips from the timetable, the vehicle block also includes a pull-out and pull-in, so that the final block for the first vehicle (gray) could look like the following.

[[File:Vehicle block.png|420px|Caption Vehicle block]]

For networks with longer policy headways (e.g., 30- or 60-minute headways), longer layovers at terminals may be necessary if vehicles serve the same route throughout the block. As a result, other options can be considered, particularly in terms of shifting vehicles from one route to another. The timetable may allow vehicles to shift from one route to another, in order to reduce layover time and/or to avoid pull-outs or pull-ins. Specific activities in the block can include:

* '''Interlining''': the process of switching a vehicle from one route to another at a terminal, when the routes share that common terminal.

* '''Deadheading''': the process of switching a vehicle from one route to another, also requiring a re-location of the vehicle (traveling empty) to another terminal. 

These methods can be quite effective under different timetabling conditions.

== Crew scheduling ==

Crew scheduling (also called “run-cutting” in the transit industry) is the task of determining work shifts (so-called “duties” or “runs”) for operators. Generally, the primary interest in crew scheduling is to minimize the total cost of labor that meets the service requirements.

A significant fraction, typically 60-70%, of the total operating costs at a transit agency involves the cost of operators, including wages, benefits, and other premiums. With this in mind, small reductions in the number of operators, or in the total work hours, can result in more substantive reductions in the total operating cost. For this reason, the task of scheduling crew to vehicles is one area where many large transit agencies can achieve some efficiencies and potential cost savings.

Crew scheduling is complicated because operators often cannot simply be assigned to a vehicle for the entire vehicle block. First, the shift would often be much longer than a typical 8-hour work period; and, second, the operator may not get sufficient break time during vehicle layovers (e.g., for lunch). Instead, the duties have to consider more practical concerns of the operators.

In this regard, transit agencies have rules that dictate the kind of work shifts the operators may perform. In most cases in the US, the types of work shifts are governed by collective bargaining agreements (union work rules) that specify work conditions for transit operators. Possible examples of work rules could include restrictions like the following:

* A duty should start and end at the same terminal
* Crew needs at least 2 breaks during the day: a normal (15-min) break and a (30-min) lunch break
* A break is required after no more than 3 hours of work
* Each crew must have at least 8 hours off before resuming duties on the next day
* Only 20% of duties can be longer than 9 hours
* Only 25% of duties can be split into intervals with an unpaid break (e.g. a duty that only covers the AM and PM peak periods)
* Only 30% of duties can be covered by part-time operators

The general approach to creating a crew schedule begins by cutting each vehicle block into “pieces of work.” Each piece of work is a subset of trips in the block, forming the elemental unit of work (driving) for the operator. Then, according to the constraints from the work rules, these pieces of work are assembled into feasible duties. The hope is to assemble a full set of duties such that all pieces of work are covered and that the total cost is minimal. The cost of a duty can depend on both the traditional hourly rate of pay for the operator for hours worked. If the operator has a ''straight'' shift (no unpaid break), they are paid a certain amount, usually at a given hourly rate. Other costs can include:

* A minimum ''guarantee'' of hours of pay, if the guarantee exceeds the number of hours worked (e.g., 8 hours of pay, even if the operator works only 7 hours);
* Premiums for ''overtime'' (e.g., time in the duty over 8 hours);
* Premiums for ''spread'' time. Spread is the total time between the start and end of a duty. If this exceeds a certain maximum (e.g., 9 hours), the operator is entitled to extra pay;
* Premiums for ''swing''. Swing occurs when the duty starts and ends at different locations (terminals, depots);
* Premiums for ''split'' duties, where the duty has an unpaid break. This can occur when an operator works only the AM and PM peak periods, without working in the mid-day;

These rules on pay suggest that the crew schedule should contain as many straight duties as possible. Small pieces of work that remain after generating these straight duties can be allocated to part-time operators (if they are available), to avoid other premiums, or covered using split duties with associated split and/or spread penalties.

A second problem in crew scheduling is ''rostering'', in which duties are assembled into a group of duties (the “roster”) for each operator, by week. For example, one roster could include the same 8-hour duty for 5 weekdays. However, many possible combinations of duties could be considered, especially if weekend or evening service is provided. Once the rosters are created, operators choose from among these duty rosters.

== Glossary ==

* Block: the sequence of trips made by a vehicle in the course of one day of operations, including both revenue and non-revenue trips.

* Duty (or, Run): a work shift for an operator for one day.

* Guarantee: the minimum pay hours for an operator, regardless of the number of hours worked.

* Piece of work: an operator work assignment extracted from a vehicle block.

* Relief: the change of operators during a vehicle block.

* Roster (also, rostering): the set of duties for a single operator in a week.

* Split: a duty covering at least two intervals of time with an unpaid break.

* Spread: the time between when an operator reports for duty and when they end their duty.

* Straight: a duty covering a single interval of time.

* Swing: a duty in which the operator begins and ends at different locations.

* Tripper: a short work assignment (e.g., 2-4 hours); generally much shorter than a typical straight.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This CDR block, in comparison with the phase comparator and the VCO,  requires much less hardware effort to be implemented.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore  it adapts itself to the interfaces that the two other blocks present to it and &lt;br /&gt;
its performances complement what is available from the other two blocks &lt;br /&gt;
to achieve the desired characteristics of the overall loop.&lt;br&gt;

When analyzing an existing CDR, in order to find out its fundamental blocks,&lt;br /&gt;
and to find the fundamental architecture that corresponds (or at least comes closest) to it,&lt;br /&gt;
the amplifier/filter is the easiest block to identify.&lt;br /&gt;
# First, it is the easiest to identify because it is the only block (unlike the phase comparator and the VCO) that needs not operate at frequencies as high as the line pulse frequency f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. In fact, it operates at the &quot;loop&quot; frequencies (that are always lower and often even some decades lower than f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;).  Consequently the technology used to implement the CDR is more than adequate for the amplifier/filter, which looks like the least sophisticated of the three blocks.
# Second, because it is a simple, self contained circuit block with only one input and one output and only one function to accomplish. The phase comparator may be combined with the pulse regenerator and bit decoder, with a run-length mitigator, etc.. The VCO may incorporate DLLs, special LC tuned networks, variable rate dividers, etc..&lt;br /&gt;
In some cases, this block may be just a level shifter, or a flat gain amplifier, or may not be present at all.&lt;br /&gt;
In all cases though, this block exhibits a linear behavior, with the only exception sometimes at its output interface (the VCO drive) if it helps control the inherent non-linearity of the VCO at its end_of_range extremes.&lt;br /&gt;

===Large signals view===
This amp/filter block adapts itself  to the other two and its input and output interfaces  match the output interface of the phase comparator and the input interface of the VCO.&lt;br /&gt;
The signal range at the output of the phase comparator corresponds to the phase interval that the comparator can follow before a slip takes place (multiplied by the comparator phase-to-voltage gain, Gφ).&lt;br /&gt;
The input range of the amp/filter is designed to match it exactly.&lt;br /&gt;
At the other interface, the filter output is designed to match the signal range that the VCO can accept at its input.
===Small signals view===
All CDRs identify, inside the received signal, a frequency close to the free-running frequency of the VCO f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;, and reject any other frequency that differs from f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; more than a certain, small amount. This amount is a characteristic bandwidth of the CDR, and is conceptually the same as the &quot;jitter bandwidth&quot; of the CDR.&lt;br /&gt;
This is primarily a consequence of the integration performed by the VCO.&lt;br /&gt;
To maintain the PLL &quot;low-pass&quot; requirement, also the amplifier/filter is always some sort of low-pass ''(that degenerates into a flat gain block in the simplest of all architectures, as presented in the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Examples|example page, Section:  1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order, type 1]] )''. 
====Flat gain====
For the simplest PLL architecture of interest (loop of 1st order and of type 1 [link indietro]), the filter structure is the simplest: just an amplifier with a flat gain of value G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; (at all frequencies of relevance for the loop operation).&lt;br /&gt;
For such a PLL with flat gain in the intermediate block, the loop jitter low-pass frequency is called  ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt;.

====Low-pass, for more sophisticated PLLs====

Besides the PLL with a flat gain block, two PLL architectures are of interest, that depend only on the architecture of the amplifier/filter itself:
# 1st order low-pass with a single pole ''(the PLL is a 2nd order type 1 loop)'':&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;y(s) / x(s) = G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;  / (sτ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + 1)&lt;/center&gt;
# 1st order low-pass with a single zero ''(the PLL is a 2nd order type 2 loop)'':&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;y(s) / x(s) = G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;  (sτ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; + 1) / sτ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;  
&lt;br /&gt;
The overall performances of these PLLs are analyzed in detail in the following pages [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL| for 1st order type 1 and for 2nd order type one]] as well as [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL| for the 2nd order type 2]] loops.&lt;br /&gt;
=====Equations of the 1st order low-pass filter in general=====
It is a generic first order linear filter, with one zero and one pole.&lt;br /&gt;
The pole is always at a frequency lower than the zero to have a low-pass. (Its output, unbound in the ideal model, will be additionally brutally clamped to +/- Range  [V] to implement the simulator program).&lt;br /&gt;
The reference used to derive the model equations (and the recurrence relation of the linear part for the simulator) can be a possible analog implementation with an operational amplifier, 3 resistors and one capacitor.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Generic PLL diagram with OpAmp filter.png|center|660px]]
The filter transfer function is obtained using the concept that the inverting input of an Op Amp stays at the same voltage of the other input, and that its impedance is infinite:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
x(s)/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = y(s)/R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  y(s)/(R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+1/sC)
y(s)/x(s) = [R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(sCR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 1)] / [R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(sCR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +sCR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 1)]
&lt;/center&gt;
Where:
&lt;center&gt;
G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; / (R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;

τ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C   ;   τ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; =  C (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

To have a calculation sheet simulate the filter, time is considered discrete, and every row of the calculation sheet represents one instant in a sequence.&lt;br /&gt;
The row index k =  1,2,3,... is the reference index for all the time sequences and Δt is the discrete time step.&lt;br /&gt;
A sequence x[k] can then be used as the representation of the input signal and a sequence y[k] as the representation of the output signal.&lt;br /&gt;
A description of the first order filter with difference equations allows the computation of every y[k] from y[k-1], x[k] and x[k-1].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;(A system of higher order would need, for the computation of the output sample, correspondingly older samples from the input and the output sequences.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;For instance, a second order system would require y[k-1], y[k-2], x[k], x[k-1] and x[k-2] for the computation of y[k]).&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the case of our first order filter, let's use the Capacitor equation:
&lt;center&gt;
ΔV =  (I*Δt)/C   
v&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k] – v&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k-1] = i&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k]Δt/C  
&lt;/center&gt;
Note that this is a backward difference, in compliance with the causality of our system.
&lt;center&gt;i&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k]Δt = C(v&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k] – v&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k-1])   '''''(1)'''''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;small&gt;(As the capacitor is the only element with memory, it is the only one that is described by a first order difference equation).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A second equation can be obtained from the Kirchoff's First Law applied to the node of the inverting input (no current flows into the inverting input of the Op Amp):
&lt;center&gt;i&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k] = x[k]/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – y[k]/R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   '''''(2)'''''		''Note: i&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ i&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/center&gt;
and a third equation from the Kirchoff's Second Law applied to the loop of the Op Amp output network:
&lt;center&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k] = y[k] – R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;i&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;   '''''(3)'''''&lt;/center&gt;
Combining '''''(1)''''', '''''(2)''''' and '''''(3)''''', the intermediate variables i&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k] and  v&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k] can be eliminated, and the solution found with respect to y[k].
&lt;center&gt;( x[n]/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – y[n]/R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Δt = C(y[n] – R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;i&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[n] – (y[n-1] – R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;i&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[n-1]))     '''''(1 &amp; 2)'''''
x[n] Δt/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – y[n] Δt/R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; =  y[n]C - R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C(x[n]/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – y[n]/R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) – y[n-1]C + CR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;( x[n-1]/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – y[n-1]/R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)           '''''(1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3)'''''
y[n]( Δt/CR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+1+R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = y[n-1](1+R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ) + x[n]( Δt/CR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)  - x[n-1](R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/center&gt;

=====1st order low-pass with a single zero=====

If R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ∞  (the PLL is of 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order,  type 2) :
[[File:2.2 Loop . Filter reference to simulate.png|center|800px|Filter reference to obtain model (w/o clamp) and simulator (w/clamp) equations]]
Where:
&lt;center&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; / R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
τ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; = CR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
τ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; =τ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/ω&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;,   with ω&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = filter cut-off frequency&lt;br /&gt;
y(s)/x(s) = G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;  (sτ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; + 1) / sτ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;  		
&lt;/center&gt;

The overall PLL block diagram, including the two hard non -linearities that are in the simulation but not in the model, is:

[[File:2.2 Loop block diagram to simulate.png|center|800px|A PLL of the second order, type two with evidence of the fundamental blocks and of the fundamental hard-linearities for the implementatrion of a simulation software]]

The low-pass filter recurrence relation for the simulation can be derved from:
&lt;center&gt;
i&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k] = C(v&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k] – v&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k-1])   (1)&lt;br /&gt;

i&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k] = i&lt;sub&gt;R1&lt;/sub&gt;[k] = x[k]/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;    (2)&lt;br /&gt;

v&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k] = y[k] – R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; i&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k]   (3)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
Combining (1), (2) and (3), the intermediate variables i&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k] and  v&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k] can be eliminated, and the solution found with respect to y[k]:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;center&gt;y[n] = y[n-1] + x[n]( Δt/CR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)  - x[n-1](R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;y[n] = y[n-1] + x[n]( Δt G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;/τ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; + G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;)  - x[n-1]G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The resulting equation can then be inserted in a calculation sheet for the simulation program. (The ratio R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the high frequency gain G&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;  and the time constant R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C corresponds to the time constant τ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;  of the finite zero).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An alternative way of presenting the single zero filter,  to introduce the 2-2 PLL as a 1-1 loop with an additional integration [link], coming to the same results, is the following:

[[File:2.2 Loop . Alternative Filter reference to model n simulate.png|center|620px|PLL loop filter to implement a 2nd order, type 2, loop. Case of a discrete time implementation where the flat gain (high frequency) and the pole in the origin (low frequency) are made with two blocks connected in parallel. Derivation of the recurrence equations.]]

Recursive equation for the flat gain block:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{out} {[n]}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G} *\mathbf{x}{[n]}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Recursive equation for the integrator block of gain 1:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;int[n] = \frac{1}{\tau_i}\textstyle \sum_1^n	x[k]\Delta t &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;int[n] = \frac{1}{\tau_i}\textstyle \sum_1^{n-1}x[k]\Delta t +\displaystyle x[n]\frac{\Delta t}{\tau_i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;int[n] = int[n-1] +x[n]\frac{\Delta t}{\tau_i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
It should be noted that an integrator (more appropriately: an &quot;accumulator&quot; in the discrete time domain) needs only one parameter to be identified. If τ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ( ω&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/τ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the angular frequency for which the gain is 1 i.e. 0 dB) is chosen, then the above applies. The equation can be re-written, without change of result, using G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/τ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; or using ω&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/τ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;
Recursive equation for a flat gain block of gain G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; in parallel with an integrator of time constant  τ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y[n] =G_f * x[n] + int[n] &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y[n] =G_f x[n] + int[n-1] +x[n]\tfrac{\Delta t}{\tau_i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y[n] =G_f x[n] +( y[n-1] -G_f x[n-1]) +x[n]\tfrac{\Delta t}{\tau_i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


_________   _______________&lt;br /&gt;

=====1st order low-pass with a single pole=====

If R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0   (the PLL is of  2nd order,  type 1) :

[[File:2.1 Loop . Filter reference to simulate.png|center|800px|Filter reference to obtain model (w/o clamp) and simulator (w/clamp) equations]]

Where:
&lt;center&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
					
τ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = CR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 					
τ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/ω&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''	-&gt; ω&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = filter cut-off frequency''&lt;br /&gt;

y(s)/x(s) = G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; / (sτ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + 1)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;			
The filter gain is flat from d.c. to the cut-off frequency, and then decreases with a slope of -20 dB/decade.&lt;br /&gt;



The overall PLL block diagram, including the two hard non -linearities that are in the simulation but not in the model, is:
[[File:2.1 Loop block diagram to simulate.png|center|800px|A PLL of the second order and of type one, with evidence of the fundamental blocks and of the fundamental hard-linearities for the implementatrion of a simulation software]]
The low-pass filter recurrence relation for the simulation can be derved from:
&lt;center&gt;
ΔQ  = C ΔV        (1)

i&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k]Δt = C(y[k] – y[k-1])   (1)

i&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k] = x[k]/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  –  y[k]/R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;     (2)

&lt;/center&gt;
Combining (1) and (2), it is possible to solve with respect to y[k], eliminating the intermediate variables i&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k] and  v&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;[k], and to get the formula for the calculation sheet:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
x[k]Δt/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; -  y[k]Δt/R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   = C(y[k] – y[k-1])
 
y[k](1+ Δt/CR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = y[k-1] + x[k]Δt/CR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

y[k] =  ( y[k-1] + x[k]Δt G&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/τ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; ) / (1+ Δt/τ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; )

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

If the filter is to be part of a PLL, the relation ω&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; /ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; is fundamental for the loop operation.&lt;br /&gt;
The filter cut-off frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; should be made greater than the loop  ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; (that is the loop  cut-off frequency if the filter is just a flat amplifier).&lt;br /&gt;
As it will be shown, a loop where ω&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is lower than 2 * ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; is underdamped according to ω&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; /2ω&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt; = ζ [link].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

===In case of a charge pump===
When the last stage of the phase comparator is a [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR phase comparator#The charge pump inside a PLL comparator for clock and data recovery|charge pump]], the performances of the loop amplifier/filter depend both on the charge pump current and on the additional RC networks&lt;ref&gt;Floyd M. Gardner, &quot;Charge-Pump Phase-Lock Loops&quot;, vol. COM-28, NO.11, pp. 1849 - 1858, November 1980 in IEEE TRANSACTION ON COMMUNICATION.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
The following figure also shows the Bode plots of the transfer functions of the two (passive) filtering options:
[[File:Charge pump and filter.png|700px|thumb|center|&lt;center&gt;The charge pump as the output stage of the phase comparator in a CDR;&lt;br /&gt;
the relevant transfer functions when a RC filtering network follows the charge pump.&lt;/center&gt;]]
The transfer functions are:&lt;br /&gt;
:::*     2-2:&lt;center&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;/i&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;   =   (1/s(C&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; + C)) * ( (1 + sRC&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) / (1 + sRC'))   ;   ''C' = series of C and C&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;(ωn&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1/(CC&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)  ;   ζ&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; always &gt; 1 in a passive network)&lt;/center&gt;
:::*     2-1:&lt;center&gt;v&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;/i&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;   =   R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; / ( (1 + sR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;C)*(1 + sR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) + sCR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;))&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;(ωn&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1/(CC&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)  ;  ζ&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; always &gt; 1 in a passive network)&lt;/center&gt;

These networks  exhibit a high frequency pole that is influenced by C ''(1/RC' with C' = CC&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/(C+C&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) in the 2-2 case and 1/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;C + 1/R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; in the 2-1 case)''.&lt;br /&gt;
The frequency of this pole is always high enough not to influence the closed loop performances in the frequency band of interest.&lt;br /&gt;
It corresponds to the need to prevent the high frequency noise (generated by the comparator logic and the charge pump) from propagating outside these circuit blocks.&lt;br /&gt;
Otherwise said, the capacitor C and the poles it creates are not considered for the PLL order and type.&lt;br /&gt;
When no RC network is present besides the capacitor C, the loop is a 1st order loop.
The considerations above, about C filtering high frequency noise of the charge pump without influencing the fundamental PLL operation, hold good as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Userboxes ==

Hello, this is fountain pen.  I'm trying to add some columns of user boxes to my [[User:Fountain Pen/Lead Author|personal page]], but when I put them in they refuse to form straight columns and look strange, with random blank spaces in between userboxes, even though there are no blank spaces in the code.  Any ideas?

:Most userboxes are designed to float left by default or right by default (I'd prefer right).  They aren't all the same height, so you get those spaces as they bunch up in a weird manner.

== jquery help ==

I coded a kind of tooltip for use in a book. I used these jquery and css codes:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;jquery&quot;&gt;
$(&quot;.suffix&quot;).hover( function() {
  var pos = $(this).position(); // position of the 'suffix'
  $(this).wrap('&lt;div class=&quot;tbox&quot; /&gt;'); // make 'suffix' a part of 'tbox'
  var tbox = $(this).parent(&quot;.tbox&quot;);
  $(this).data('title',$(this).attr('title')); 
  var tooltip = $(this).data(&quot;title&quot;);
  $(this).removeAttr('title'); // remove title to prevent native tooltip
  tbox.append('&lt;span class=&quot;tooltip&quot;&gt;' + tooltip + &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;); // add the tooltip text
  tbox.css( { &quot;display&quot;: &quot;block&quot;, &quot;left&quot;: (pos.left-5) + &quot;px&quot;, &quot;top&quot;: (pos.top-7) + &quot;px&quot; } ); // set the position of the 'tbox'
  $(this).clone().insertBefore(tbox).attr(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;csuffix&quot;); // place a clone of the 'suffix' as a placeholder
}, function() {
  var tbox = $(this).parent(&quot;.tbox&quot;);
  var clone = tbox.prev(&quot;#csuffix&quot;); 
  clone.remove(); //remove clone
  $(this).insertBefore(tbox); //replace 'suffix'
  var tbox = $(this).siblings(&quot;.tbox&quot;); //tbox is no longer parent
  tbox.remove();
  $(this).attr('title',$(this).data(&quot;title&quot;)); //replace 'title' for another hover event
} );
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Review Book I'm Working On ==

I've spent some time over the past few months starting the book [[RAC Attack - Oracle Cluster Database at Home]].  I finally got conventions for style and layout that were satisfactory to me, and just this morning I finished migrating in all content from the first section of the original book (CC-BY-SA).

At this stage, I'm wondering if some experienced wikibookians have a few minutes to skim over the structure and style choices I've made and pass along any comments?

here are a few highlights of design decisions:
*flat structure for pages, but a deep structure for page categories (good organization for lots of pages which are coming, but easy to move pages between sections) - note this is automatically accomplished with templates
*all images are max 550px wide... and i'm pretty sure that copyright information is correct in uploads (check?)
*templates for top and bottom navigation components; chapter overview pages double as templates for content pages
*standardized combination of html and wiki-markup to get good spacing and formatting on pages
*planning to eventually code an updated version of [[User:Derbeth/javaLatex]] for PDF and printing (lots of effort, but no love from mwlib.rl/pediapress)
*planned workflow: initial version of lab handbook is very thoroughly tested; all new pages will go into &quot;BullPen&quot; at first until they are tested by somebody and then moved into an appropriate section of the book

I'd also appreciate any thoughts gleaned from looking directly at the book itself.  Thanks!

:Why should diagrams and other illustrations be created custom for the book? In fact that requirement is the only thing that makes the convention necessary...
:Aside for that the only thing I personally dislike is the use of extra navigation templates but in your case since you aren't using the slash convention it may be required, in any case I would substitute the one used for only a link to the top index and the previous and next page.

In other words, all media must be compatible with and uploaded to the commons, unless it's a screenshot which can't be.  Right now there are only a few media under this (non-screenshot) category: the cover/title page graphic, the flowchart of the labs, an architectural overview and a vertical arrow from the first content page.  Of course it's best to re-use content which has already been uploaded to commons (like the vertical arrow in the first content page).  Thanks for the comments!  --[[User:ArdentPerf|ArdentPerf]] ([[User talk:ArdentPerf|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ArdentPerf|contribs]]) 17:06, 13 July 2011 (UTC)
== Weird message ==

For some reason when I acess the page [[Special:RevisionDelete]] I'm getting [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAllMessages&amp;prefix=badaccess-groups+&amp;filter=all&amp;lang=en this unrelated warning]. Could someone restore the original text of the message? [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]] 22:12, 4 July 2011 (UTC)
:Maybe it is enough to use a &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#ifeq:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|Special:Upload|current message|original message}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]] 22:15, 4 July 2011 (UTC)
::Yes, that message was modified for people clicking red-linked images at Wikibooks, which points to the local upload form rather than Commons, when we only allow admins/uploaders to upload non-free files locally.  It's true that it appears for other permissions errors as well. I've implemented your suggested code and it does appear to work.  Thanks! &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:39, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
:::Do you know about [[mw:Manual:$wgUploadMissingFileUrl|$wgUploadMissingFileUrl]]? See e.g. [[bugzilla:29360]]. [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]] 00:35, 6 July 2011 (UTC)
== Collection extension update ==

I just wanted to note that the proposal discussed on
:[[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Proposals/2011/March#Define $wgCollectionHierarchyDelimiter = &quot;/&quot; for Wikibooks project(s)]]
was [http://wikitech.wikimedia.org/index.php?title=Server_admin_log&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=35366&amp;oldid=35364 implemented], closing [[bugzilla:|bug 29648]]. Now [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?diff=next&amp;oldid=2054430 this kind of edit] will not be necessary anymore ;-) [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]] 14:19, 20 July 2011 (UTC)
== InterWiki templates ==

On the [[Subject:Languages]] there is the best horizontal interWiki template. Can I place the same template on the category [[:Category:Languages]] ? Or vertical templates more useful in that case? --[[User:Averaver|Averaver]] ([[User talk:Averaver|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Averaver|contribs]]) 15:36, 18 July 2011 (UTC)
:I agree with your idea. It should look neater and save space on the page. I think you can '''be bold''' here, and make the change without any more discussion. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 17:57, 18 July 2011 (UTC)
:: Ok. I placed horizontal interWiki template on the category [[:Category:Languages]] . If no objection for it I will update some other articles and categories on Wikibooks. --[[User:Averaver|Averaver]] ([[User talk:Averaver|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Averaver|contribs]]) 01:57, 19 July 2011 (UTC)

:What is &quot;best&quot; is a mater of opinion. I think [[Template:Sisterlinks]] is probably better than [[Template:Associated Wikimedia]] because it doesn't use as much screen space and compliments rather than draw attention away from what a page is about. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:43, 19 July 2011 (UTC)
::Yes, the information directly relating to the Wikibooks category is probably the main reason to visit the page so the smaller template is preferable. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 18:36, 19 July 2011 (UTC)
::The [[Template:Sisterlinks]] template is similar to the [[w:Template:Sister project links]] from Wikipedia. The [[Template:Associated Wikimedia]] template is more powerful for manual control of interWiki links. --[[User:Averaver|Averaver]] ([[User talk:Averaver|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Averaver|contribs]]) 07:45, 20 July 2011 (UTC)

{{sisterlinks
|wikinews = Language
|wikiquote = Language
|wikisource = Language
|Languages
}}

::: I added a way to manually control interwiki links for each project with the Sisterlinks template too now. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:29, 20 July 2011 (UTC)
:::: Thank you. Could you please place some info about that facility to template's article? --[[User:Averaver|Averaver]] ([[User talk:Averaver|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Averaver|contribs]]) 18:11, 21 July 2011 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[K3D JavaScript Canvas Library|canvas K3D]] libraries at http://kevs3d.co.uk/dev/canvask3d by [http://twitter.com/kevinroast Kevin Roast] are JavaScript libraries for three dimensional graphics using HTML5 canvas. As of October 18th, 2011, they included [http://kevs3d.co.uk/dev/canvask3d/canvask3d-src.zip these files:]

== example1.html ==

Runs the simplest possible K3D example, showing setup of a simple HTML5 page with a canvas element, importing the K3D libraries, set up and display of an animated wireframe 3D cube.

== example2.html ==

A simple K3D example, showing setup of a simple HTML5 page with a canvas element, importing the K3D libraries, set up and display of an animated lightsourced 3D cube - the cube animated by bouncing around a virtual bounding box.

== example3.html ==

Another simple example, displaying an animated texture mapped lightsourced 3D cube.

== k3d_test.html ==
Shows five demonstrations; &quot;Click the demos above to start or stop them! Last Updated: 22/08/11&quot;; the author's contact information; links to more demos and the link to download the source code .zip files described here.  In the center the initially running demonstration shows a couple dozen wireframe cubes composited over a texture of chili peppers. The icosahedron in the lower left will respond to spacebar key presses to transition between polygons, a wireframe, and points,  while the sphere on the lower right shows texture mapping to animated objects.

== k3d_test_DEBUG.html ==

As k3d_test.html above but TPF (time per frame) and FPS (frames per second) statistics are shown.

=== scripts/k3ddemos.js ===

This file used by k3d_test.html and k3d_test_DEBUG.html sets up the five demos on five canvas elements:
# &quot;A snake of cubes&quot;, using 24 new K3D.K3DObject()s, each with a different .ophi and .otheta property, and the same drawmode=&quot;wireframe&quot;, addgamma, add{gamma,theta,phi}, about{x,y,z}, and scale properties, init(points in coordinates, vertices in point pairs, faces as a color and four vertices each); then K3D.Controller(canvas element).addK3DObject() for all 24 cubes
# &quot;distribute points on the surface of a sphere in a spiral&quot;, first creating a list of points and edges around a sphere, then K3DObject's add{gamma,theta,phi}, linescale, init(pts, edges, []), then addK3DObject()
# &quot;wireframe spiral sphere&quot; same as the previous except with drawmode=&quot;wireframe&quot;
# &quot;Icosahedron&quot; [http://student.ulb.ac.be/~claugero/sphere/index.html generator code], drawmode=&quot;solid&quot; initially, shademode=&quot;lightsource&quot;, fillstroke=&quot;false&quot; initially, with init(points, edges, polygons by vertices with colors)
# &quot;tesselated sphere - strips of tris have been converted to quads&quot; drawmode=&quot;solid&quot;, shademode=&quot;lightsource&quot;, but with init(points, [], polygons by vertices with textures)

Also included are sections of code as useful examples with the following headings:
* &quot;add lightsource for solid object demo&quot;
* &quot;add an object to represent the lightsource so it is visible in the scene&quot; (also for solid object demo #5 above)
* &quot;render first frames&quot; 
** &quot;use motion blur background fill&quot;
* &quot;bind document keyhandler to aid debugging&quot;

== ultralight.html ==

This runs a pointer-manipulable animated demo that is an example of animated colour lights and also manipulating the vertices of an object in real-time via the callback interface.

== ultralight_DEBUG.html ==

As ultralight.html above but TPF (time per frame) and FPS (frames per second) statistics are shown.

=== scripts/ultralight.js ===

This file used by ultralight.html and ultralight_DEBUG.html sets up the demos 3D object on the canvas element, the object vertex callback method to modify the object and pointer interaction to rotate the object. 

Included are sections of code as useful examples with the following headings:
* &quot;generate test objects&quot; &quot;A tesselated sheet&quot;, generates a flat sheet of rectangles (tesselated plane) as a K3D object. The function tesselatedPlane() could be reused in other demos for this purpose.
* &quot;manipulate points&quot;, example of modifying the vertices of an object in real-time via the callback method.
* &quot;add light sources&quot;, add multiple colour lights
* &quot;add 3D objects to represent the light sources so they are visible in the scene&quot;, example of adding visible 3D objects that represent the location of the lights in the scene.
* &quot;nifty drag/touch event capture code borrowed from Mr Doob http://mrdoob.com/&quot;, public domain code to bind the mouse and mobile device touch events into handlers to allow user controlled real-time rotation of the object.

== html5logo.html ==

This runs a pointer-manipulable animated demo that is an example of the new HTML5 logo in 3D. There is also an animated background generated using standard canvas 2D APIs.

== html5logo_DEBUG.html ==

As html5logo.html above but TPF (time per frame) and FPS (frames per second) statistics are shown.

=== scripts/html5logo.js ===

This file used by html5logo.html and html5logo_DEBUG.html sets up the demos 3D objects on the canvas element and pointer interaction to rotate the object. The HTML5 logo object is composed of several object sections defined as separate K3D objects and added to a single K3D controller for compositing together.

Included are sections of code as useful examples with the following headings:
* &quot;add render loop callback&quot;, example of a K3D render callback function
* &quot;manually clear bg - as we want to render some extra goodies, draw bg effect before K3D does its 3D rendering&quot;, manually clearing the background and performing some canvas 2D API calls to generate a custom background before K3D is used to render the HTML5 logo.
* &quot;nifty drag/touch event capture code borrowed from Mr Doob http://mrdoob.com/&quot;, public domain code to bind the mouse and mobile device touch events into handlers to allow user controlled real-time rotation of the object.

== scripts/mathlib.js ==

This math library begins with the mathematical constants and functions '''RAD''' (pi/180), '''PI''', '''TWOPI''', '''ONEOPI''' (1/pi), '''PIO2''' (pi/2), '''PIO4''', '''PIO8''', '''PIO16''', '''PIO32''', '''Rnd'''=Math.random(), '''Sin'''(), '''Cos'''(), '''Sqrt'''(), '''Floor'''(), '''Atan2'''(), '''Ceil'''(), followed by '''randomInt'''(low, high), '''weightedRandom'''(weight) -- which seems to return a float from [0,1] -- and the '''calcNormalVector'''(x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2) function returning a new Vector3D.

They are followed by the '''extend'''(subclass to modify, superclass to inherit, overrides properties and/or methods) utility function, &quot;to set up the prototype, constructor and superclass properties to support an inheritance strategy that can chain constructors and methods. Static members will not be inherited.&quot; It is used for some of the K3D classes defined in the k3d_... files below, and not in this file.

Then '''isArray'''(object), a boolean function is defined as object.constructor.toString().indexOf(&quot;Array&quot;) !== -1.

Then the two dimensional '''Vector''' class is defined with a '''vector'''(x,y) initializer, '''.x''' and '''.y''' properties initialized to 0, followed by the '''.clone'''(), '''.set'''(vector), '''.add'''(v), '''.sub'''(v), '''.dot'''(v), '''.length'''(), '''.distance'''(v), '''.theta'''(), '''.thetaTo'''(v), '''.thetaTo2'''(v), '''.norm'''(), '''.rotate'''(angle), '''.invert'''(), '''.scale'''(s), and '''.scaleTo'''(size) methods.

Then the '''Vector3D''' class is defined similarly with a '''vector3D'''(x,y,z) initializer, a '''.prototype''' property {x:0,y:0,z:0}, the methods shown above along with '''.cross'''(vector3D), '''.norm'''(), but not including .theta(), .thetaTo2(), or .scaleTo().

Finally, an image '''Preloader''' class is provided with &lt;!-- these are likely supposed to be hidden: an '''.images''' list array property, a '''.callback''' function property, a '''.counter''' integer property, and --&gt; the '''.addImage'''(image, url) and '''.onLoadCallback'''(fn) method.

== scripts/k3d_*.js ==

The various k3d JavaScript files &lt;tt&gt;k3d_main.js&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;k3d_controller.js&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;k3d_object.js&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;k3d_light.js&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;k3d_renderer.js&lt;/tt&gt; contain the source for the library itself. Refer to the [[K3D JavaScript Canvas Library/API Reference|API Reference]] pages for library reference information and code examples.

== scripts/DEBUG.js ==

This very short source file (&lt;tt&gt;DEBUG = { FPS: false };&lt;/tt&gt;) suggests that statistics are turned off by default, unless the '''DEBUG.FPS''' value is set to true, which is done with script tags in the ..._DEBUG.html files included with the source code zipfile above.

== phpobj/obj_to_kv3d.php ==

A [[w:PHP|PHP]] script for converting from [[w:Wavefront .obj file|Wavefront .obj file]] format to arguments for K3D.Controller's init() method.  There is example output on http://www.kevs3d.co.uk/dev/canvask3d/example_phpobj.html &amp;mdash; &quot;view source&quot; and scroll down to &quot;&lt;tt&gt;// pasted output from the .kv3d file output by obj_to_kv3d.php script&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.

Example usage:
php obj_to_kv3d.php cube.obj &gt; cube.k3d

This will direct the output of the script converting the cube.obj file to a new file cube.k3d. Example contents of the file:
&lt;pre&gt;
[{x:0.0,y:0.0,z:0.0},{x:0.0,y:0.0,z:1.0},{x:0.0,y:1.0,z:0.0},{x:0.0,y:1.0,z:1.0},{x:1.0,y:0.0,z:0.0},{x:1.0,y:0.0,z:1.0},{x:1.0,y:1.0,z:0.0},{x:1.0,y:1.0,z:1.0}],
[],
[{vertices:[0,6,4]},{vertices:[0,2,6]},{vertices:[0,3,2]},{vertices:[0,1,3]},{vertices:[2,7,6]},{vertices:[2,3,7]},{vertices:[4,6,7]},{vertices:[4,7,5]},{vertices:[0,4,5]},{vertices:[0,5,1]},{vertices:[1,5,7]},{vertices:[1,7,3]}]
&lt;/pre&gt;
This 3D data can be pasted directly into the init() method for a K3DObject - such as in this example: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/K3D_JavaScript_Canvas_Library/Tutorial#Example_1:_Minimum_simple_page_set-up_and_Hello_World_example_K3D_object

== images/{peppers,texture{0,1,2,3,4,5}}.png ==

These are six [[w:Portable Network Graphics|.PNG]] format graphics files, the first of which is used for a compositing background and the others for polygon textures during the various demos.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

CanvasK3D is a simple 3D &lt;math&gt;\rarr&lt;/math&gt; 2D projection and animation system written purely in JavaScript using the HTML5 canvas for rendering.  It can display 3D objects generated from a set of 3D vectors and described as polygons in a simple JavaScript object structure. Multiple objects can be displayed as individual points, wireframe (lines), solid filled polygons or textured (image mapped) polygons, then shaded using either plain colour, depth cued (z-ordered) or light-sourced using a linear-additive lighting model with any number of coloured lights. Objects can be automatically animated around a point and moved to make simple demonstrations. 

K3D does not support a &quot;camera&quot; as such. It does not generate a full 3D scene with a movable &quot;observer&quot; or &quot;look at&quot; vectors. Instead a very simple 2D perspective projection is used - a fixed observer looking down the Z-axis towards the origin. See also [http://a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html A2k0n's &quot;donut math&quot;] for a description of the basic math behind 3D perspective rendering.

CanvasK3D runs on any modern HTML5 compatible browser. It does not use Web-GL so will also run on Android phones and Apple iOS devices. Recommend the use of Chome, Firefox, Safari, Opera or IE9 browsers.

=== Further background ===

[http://kevs3d.co.uk/dev/canvask3d The code for the simple-but-fast K3D engine] (&quot;Kevs 3D&quot;, no relation to the k-3d C/C++ library of similar name) was originally written in C/C++ back in the coding dark-ages of 1996, converted to a very-nifty-for-the-time-thanks Java 1.0 Applet in 1998 (the first 3D in Java? - well before the Java3D APIs existed) and recently converted to modern JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. The original inspiration for the engine (and some of the code!) came from a book: Real-time 3D Graphics for the Atari ST: A Practical Guide to 68000 Assembler Programming by Andrew Tyler.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== CanvasK3D tutorial ==

K3D objects have user definable properties describing the object's relative position from the origin and allowing simple animations that increment one or more of the object's angles or position vector elements over time. There are also properties describing how the object should be rendered by the engine. Playing with these properties is a good way of getting used to how they control the rendering of the object.

===Example 1: Minimum simple page set-up and Hello World example K3D object===

This example show how to set-up a simple HTML5 page with the minimum required to initialise a simple cube as a K3D object on a canvas:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;K3D - Example 1&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/mathlib.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/k3d_main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/k3d_controller.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/k3d_object.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/k3d_light.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/k3d_renderer.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script&gt;
// bind to window onload event
window.addEventListener('load', onloadHandler, false);

function onloadHandler()
{
   // get the canvas DOM element
   var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
   
   // bind a K3D Controller object to the canvas
   // - it is responsible for managing the K3D objects displayed within it
   var k3d = new K3D.Controller(canvas);
   // request 60 frames per second animation from the controller
   k3d.fps = 60;
   
   // create a K3D object for rendering
   var obj = new K3D.K3DObject();
   with (obj)
   {
      color = [255,0,0];      // colour used for wireframe edges and depthcues
      drawmode = &quot;wireframe&quot;; // one of &quot;point&quot;, &quot;wireframe&quot;, &quot;solid&quot;
      shademode = &quot;plain&quot;;    // one of &quot;plain&quot;, &quot;depthcue&quot;,
                              //   &quot;lightsource&quot; (solid drawing mode only)
      addphi = 1.0;           // 1 degree of rotation around Y axis per frame
      scale = 50;             // make fifty times bigger
      init(
         // describe the eight points of a simple unit cube
         [{x:-1,y:1,z:-1}, {x:1,y:1,z:-1}, {x:1,y:-1,z:-1}, {x:-1,y:-1,z:-1},
          {x:-1,y:1,z:1}, {x:1,y:1,z:1}, {x:1,y:-1,z:1}, {x:-1,y:-1,z:1}],
         // describe the twelve edges of the cube
         [{a:0,b:1}, {a:1,b:2}, {a:2,b:3}, {a:3,b:0}, {a:4,b:5}, {a:5,b:6},
          {a:6,b:7}, {a:7,b:4}, {a:0,b:4}, {a:1,b:5}, {a:2,b:6}, {a:3,b:7}],
         // describe the six polygon faces of the cube
         [{color:[255,0,0],vertices:[0,1,2,3]}, {color:[0,255,0],vertices:[0,4,5,1]},
          {color:[0,0,255],vertices:[1,5,6,2]}, {color:[255,255,0],vertices:[2,6,7,3]},
          {color:[0,255,255],vertices:[3,7,4,0]}, {color:[255,0,255],vertices:[7,6,5,4]}]
      );
   }
   
   // add the object to the controller
   k3d.addK3DObject(obj);
   
   // begin the rendering and animation immediately
   k3d.paused = false;
   k3d.frame();
}
      &lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   
   &lt;body style=&quot;background-color: #bfbfbf&quot;&gt;
      &lt;canvas id=&quot;canvas&quot; width=&quot;256&quot; height=&quot;256&quot;
              style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====How does it work?====
The file sets up a basic HTML5 page structure with a single '''canvas''' element that K3D will used for rendering output. The K3D JavaScript libraries are imported. The inline JavaScript then gets the canvas DOM element to pass to K3D. A K3D.Controller object is created which is responsible for managing multiple K3D objects and rendering them onto the supplied canvas element. A simple 3D cube is then defined as a K3D.K3DObject, wireframe rendering mode is used. Various public properties are set to initialize the color, scaling (size) and animation properties. Finally the K3D object is added to the controller and the animation is started.

===Example 2: Simple page set-up and bouncing light-sourced cube===

This example builds on Example 1 and this time shows how to display the cube using the light-sourced rendering mode and use the built in simple animation to bounce the cube around a virtual bounding box:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;K3D - Example 2&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/mathlib.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/k3d_main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/k3d_controller.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/k3d_object.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/k3d_light.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/k3d_renderer.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script&gt;
// bind to window onload event
window.addEventListener('load', onloadHandler, false);

function onloadHandler()
{
   // get the canvas DOM element
   var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
   
   // bind a K3D Controller object to the canvas
   // - it is responsible for managing the K3D objects displayed within it
   var k3d = new K3D.Controller(canvas);
   // request 60 frames per second animation from the controller
   k3d.fps = 60;
   
   // create a K3D object for rendering
   var obj = new K3D.K3DObject();
   with (obj)
   {
      color = [255,0,0];      // colour used for wireframe edges and depthcued rendering mode
      drawmode = &quot;solid&quot;;     // one of &quot;point&quot;, &quot;wireframe&quot;, &quot;solid&quot;
      shademode = &quot;lightsource&quot;; // one of &quot;plain&quot;, &quot;depthcue&quot;, &quot;lightsource&quot; (solid mode only)
      addtheta = addgamma = 1.0;   // set rotation animation
      scale = 25;
      velx = 0.5; vely = velz = 1;   // give the object some velocity in the 3 axes
 
      // create a virtual &quot;bounding box&quot; within which the object will automatically bounce around
      // the engine reverses the velocity of the axis when the mid point touches the edge of the box
      bminx = bminy = bminz = -50;
      bmaxx = bmaxy = bmaxz = 50;
 
      init(
         // describe the points of a simple unit cube
         [{x:-1,y:1,z:-1}, {x:1,y:1,z:-1}, {x:1,y:-1,z:-1}, {x:-1,y:-1,z:-1},
          {x:-1,y:1,z:1}, {x:1,y:1,z:1}, {x:1,y:-1,z:1}, {x:-1,y:-1,z:1}],
         // describe the edges of the cube
         [{a:0,b:1}, {a:1,b:2}, {a:2,b:3}, {a:3,b:0}, {a:4,b:5}, {a:5,b:6},
          {a:6,b:7}, {a:7,b:4}, {a:0,b:4}, {a:1,b:5}, {a:2,b:6}, {a:3,b:7}],
         // describe the polygon faces of the cube
         [{color:[255,0,0],vertices:[0,1,2,3]},{color:[0,255,0],vertices:[0,4,5,1]},
          {color:[0,0,255],vertices:[1,5,6,2]},{color:[255,255,0],vertices:[2,6,7,3]},
          {color:[0,255,255],vertices:[3,7,4,0]},{color:[255,0,255],vertices:[7,6,5,4]}]
      );
   }
   
   // add the object to the controller
   k3d.addK3DObject(obj);
   
   // begin the rendering and animation immediately
   k3d.paused = false;
   k3d.frame();
}
      &lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   
   &lt;body style=&quot;background-color: #bfbfbf&quot;&gt;
      &lt;canvas id=&quot;canvas&quot; width=&quot;256&quot; height=&quot;256&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====How does it work?====
As above in example 1, however this time '''drawmode = &quot;solid&quot;''' and '''shademode = &quot;lightsource&quot;''' are used to display the cube as solid polygons with default light-sourcing. In addition a virtual bouncing box is defined for the object, in which K3D uses to provide a simple animation of the cube bouncing around.

===Example 3: Simple page set-up and texture mapped cube===

This example builds on Example 2 and this time shows how to apply a texture to each side of the cube:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;K3D - Example 3&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/mathlib.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/k3d_main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/k3d_controller.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/k3d_object.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/k3d_light.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script src=&quot;scripts/k3d_renderer.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script&gt;
// bind to window onload event
window.addEventListener('load', onloadHandler, false);

var bitmaps = [];
function onloadHandler()
{
   // get the images loading
   bitmaps.push(new Image());
   var loader = new Preloader();
   loader.addImage(bitmaps[0], 'images/texture5.png');
   loader.onLoadCallback(init);
}

function init()
{
   // get the canvas DOM element
   var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
   
   // bind a K3D Controller object to the canvas
   // - it is responsible for managing the K3D objects displayed within it
   var k3d = new K3D.Controller(canvas);
   // request 60 frames per second animation from the controller
   k3d.fps = 60;
   
   // create a K3D object for rendering
   var obj = new K3D.K3DObject();
   obj.textures.push(bitmaps[0]);
   with (obj)
   {
      drawmode = &quot;solid&quot;;     // one of &quot;point&quot;, &quot;wireframe&quot;, &quot;solid&quot;
      shademode = &quot;lightsource&quot;;    // one of &quot;plain&quot;, &quot;depthcue&quot;, &quot;lightsource&quot; (solid drawing mode only)
      addtheta = addgamma = 1.0;
      scale = 65;
      init(
         // describe the points of a simple unit cube
         [{x:-1,y:1,z:-1}, {x:1,y:1,z:-1}, {x:1,y:-1,z:-1}, {x:-1,y:-1,z:-1}, {x:-1,y:1,z:1}, {x:1,y:1,z:1}, {x:1,y:-1,z:1}, {x:-1,y:-1,z:1}],
         // describe the edges of the cube
         [{a:0,b:1}, {a:1,b:2}, {a:2,b:3}, {a:3,b:0}, {a:4,b:5}, {a:5,b:6}, {a:6,b:7}, {a:7,b:4}, {a:0,b:4}, {a:1,b:5}, {a:2,b:6}, {a:3,b:7}],
         // describe the polygon faces of the cube
         [{color:[255,0,0],vertices:[0,1,2,3],texture:0},{color:[0,255,0],vertices:[0,4,5,1],texture:0},{color:[0,0,255],vertices:[1,5,6,2],texture:0},{color:[255,255,0],vertices:[2,6,7,3],texture:0},{color:[0,255,255],vertices:[3,7,4,0],texture:0},{color:[255,0,255],vertices:[7,6,5,4],texture:0}]
      );
   }
   
   // add the object to the controller
   k3d.addK3DObject(obj);
   
   // begin the rendering and animation immediately
   k3d.paused = false;
   k3d.frame();
}
      &lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   
   &lt;body style=&quot;background-color: #bfbfbf&quot;&gt;
      &lt;canvas id=&quot;canvas&quot; width=&quot;256&quot; height=&quot;256&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====How does it work?====
As above in example 2, however this time a texture image is loaded using the Preloader helper class. Once the image is loaded it is applied on each face of the cube object. K3D then texture maps the cube when rendered.

===More advanced examples===
Please study the files '''k3d_test.html''' along with '''scripts/k3ddemos.js''' and '''ultralight.html''' along with '''scripts/ultralight.js'''. Changing some of the parameters in the .js files and observing the results might be most useful. Using a JavaScript debugger (e.g. Firebug for Firefox, WebKit Inspector) may be useful once you have covered the basics of the library and how it works.

my husband and I just took the bus to Seattle and got on the water taxi went to West Seattle and got on a little free bus and went to Alki beach to see an art show there. Then went back the same way to Seattle, Walked to a tall building called Smith towel and went all the way up to 35 floor, looked all the view to the Seattle waterfront! Then took the bus to Mountlake Terrace park and ride and got to our car and went home. We go home at five O'clock pm, and I made a chicken salad and cook some rice  for our dinner.</text>

== Debug prints with &lt;tt&gt;Debug.Trace&lt;/tt&gt; ==

Debug prints are a common way to debug programs. In imperative languages, we can just sprinkle the code with print statements to standard output or to some as log file in order to track debug information (e.g. value of a particular variable, or some human-readable message). In Haskell, however, we cannot output any information other than through the IO monad; and we don't want to introduce that just for debugging.

To deal with this problem, the standard library provides the {{Haskell lib|p=base|v=latest|Debug|Trace}}. That module exports a function called &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt; which provides a convenient way to attach debug print statements anywhere in a program. For instance, this program prints every argument passed to &lt;code&gt;fib&lt;/code&gt; when not equal to 0 or 1:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
module Main where
import Debug.Trace

fib :: Int -&gt; Int
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = trace (&quot;n: &quot; ++ show n) $ fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)

main = putStrLn $ &quot;fib 4: &quot; ++ show (fib 4)
&lt;/source&gt;

Below is the resulting output:

&lt;pre&gt;
n: 4
n: 3
n: 2
n: 2
fib 4: 3
&lt;/pre&gt;

Also, &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt; makes it possible to trace execution steps of program; that is, which function is called first, second, etc. To do so, we annotate parts of functions we are interested in, like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
module Main where
import Debug.Trace

factorial :: Int -&gt; Int
factorial n | n == 0    = trace (&quot;branch 1&quot;) 1
            | otherwise = trace (&quot;branch 2&quot;) $ n * (factorial $ n - 1)

main = do
    putStrLn $ &quot;factorial 6: &quot; ++ show (factorial 6)
&lt;/source&gt;

When a program annotated in such way is run, it will print the debug strings in the same order the annotated statements were executed. That output might help to locate errors in case of missing statements or similar things.

=== Some extra advice ===

As demonstrated above, &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt; can be used outside of the IO monad; and indeed its type signature...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
trace :: String -&gt; a -&gt; a
&lt;/source&gt;

...indicates that it is a pure function. Yet surely &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt; ''is'' doing IO while printing useful messages. What's going on? In fact, &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt; uses a dirty trick of sorts to circumvent the separation between IO and pure Haskell. That is reflected in the following disclaimer, found in the [http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Debug-Trace#v:trace.html documentation for &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt;]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The trace function should ''only'' be used for debugging, or for monitoring execution. The function is not referentially transparent: its type indicates that it is a pure function but it has the side effect of outputting the trace message. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A common mistake in using &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt;: while trying to fit the debug traces into an existing function, one accidentally includes the value being evaluated in the message to be printed by &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt;; e.g. don't do anything like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
let foo = trace (&quot;foo = &quot; ++ show foo) $ bar
in  baz
&lt;/source&gt;

That leads to infinite recursion because trace message will be evaluated before bar expression which will lead to evaluation of foo in terms of trace message and bar again and trace message will be evaluated before bar and so forth to infinity. Instead of &lt;code&gt;show foo&lt;/code&gt;, the correct trace message should have &lt;code&gt;show bar&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
let foo = trace (&quot;foo = &quot; ++ show bar) $ bar
in  baz
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Useful idioms ===

A helper function that incorporates &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; can be convenient:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
traceThis :: (Show a) =&gt; a -&gt; a
traceThis x = trace (show x) x
&lt;/source&gt;

In a similar vein, &lt;code&gt;Debug.Trace&lt;/code&gt; defines a &lt;code&gt;traceShow&lt;/code&gt; function, that &quot;prints&quot; its first argument and evaluates to the second one:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
traceShow :: (Show a) =&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; b
traceShow = trace . show
&lt;/source&gt;

Finally, a function &lt;code&gt;debug&lt;/code&gt; like this one may prove handy as well:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
debug = flip trace
&lt;/source&gt;

This will allow you to write code like...
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main = (1 + 2) `debug` &quot;adding&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

... making it easier to comment/uncomment debugging statements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cultural Imperialism can be tentatively defined as a form of unequal, but not unilateral, cultural diffusion, across cultures or cultural traits, that results in the suppression of the distinctive characteristics of the less dominant in relation to the dominant one.

{{TODO|Define cultural superiority. Define &quot;primitive&quot; cultures.}}

The relation is said to be unequal because it is often imposed, by economic, social or political decisions or processes, that has even involve armed conflict to establish said superiority and control.

{{TODO|Include the concepts: &quot;who wins the war will be the one that will write its history&quot;, &quot;war is to cultures what sex is for animals&quot;}}  

With the creation of writing, it was then possible to exercise control over knowledge and the diffusion of information. 

{{TODO|Cover why masses where given in Latin. How control of writing (and now mass media) has and continues to influence human cultures.  Religion and its relation with the written works and first adopter of the printing press. The impact the superior Hollywood structure had in European cinema (Hollywood and communism, European protection to Cinema and TV productions). Control of mass media, propaganda and marketing concepts.}}

{{TODO|Give examples using Native Americans (and all Indian Nations, African Nations and Tribes) or even the technological/economical exploration of India, China and Japan, especially during the European expansionism (or the previous effect of Islam expansionism until reaching Europe). Population movements in North America (pre-colonization and after colonization) or by China in Tibet. The part that religion expansionism has had on cultural diversity (ie. missionary missions), most interestingly in the north of Europe. The depth of changes in Japan and Germany after WWII and even in Korea (similarly previous Korea and Japan relation). The cold war and the importance of the satellite countries.  Religion as a basis for conflict (crusades). The issue with copyright laws and intellectual property (for instance the issue with GM foods).}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Intent of the Project ==

This textbook is intended as a resource for social studies teachers who wish to harness educational technology in their classrooms. This book will highlight, evaluate, and recommend different media and methods for leveraging learning through the use of technology. The main focus of the work is on exposing new and novel formats for teaching in a virtual environment. 

== Section 1: Educational Media &amp; Social Studies Education ==

There are two sections to this textbook. The first is divided out by the medium highlighted (i.e. e-books, blogs, etc.). This is the main content of the textbook, itself, where various educational technologies are highlighted. Everyone is invited to contribute, especially tech-savvy educators, students, and members of the wiki community.

== Section 2: Examples &amp; Class Projects ==

This section is intended as a place were teachers and contributors can post social studies [example units, lesson plans, activities, &amp; class projects] that leverage educational technology in order to help teachers teach or students learn social studies. It is also a place where teachers may post the results of various online projects their classes have done.

This section is also intended to inform the first section concerning various educational media. The content in this section will act as a rich resource for contributors that are highlighting various educational technology media. Contributors can draw examples, illustrations, and anecdotes from this section in order to discuss the employment of educational technology meaningfully in their contributions to the first section of this book. The hope is that contributors who are not educators by profession will not be deterred from adding their ideas for lack of direct experience in the classroom. Rather, they can draw on the [example units, lesson plans, activities, &amp; class projects]within this database in order to illustrate their ideas.

Lastly, the contents of this section will serve as ideas and suggestions for how to implement educational technology within the social studies classroom upon this book's completion. Therefore, these resources will serve as both examples and exemplars.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;gallery&gt;[[File:Athelstan1.jpg|thumb|A stained glass work of art of King Athelstan]]&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Athelstan ruled from 924-940. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Athelstan, who was the eldest son of King Edward the Elder and and Ecgwynn was born in 895 during the latter years of the reign of his grandfather, King Alfred the Great. Very little is known about Athelstan's mother. Some sources describe her as a &quot;common law wife&quot;. There are reasons to suspect that she was of low social status for a prince's wife. The marriage or relationship of Edward and Ecgwynn appears to have come to end before Edward became king. 

Athelstan is recorded as being a tall and handsome youth with light flaxen hair. As a youth he had been ennobled by his grandfather, of whom he was said to be a great favourite. To mark the occasion King Alfred endowed his grandson with a mantle of royal purple, a girdle set with precious stones and a Saxon seax (sword) in a golden scabbard.

As a child, Athelstan had been brought up in the care of his aunt, Ethelfleda, known as the Lady of Mercia. He was thirty years old at the time of his father's death. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Edward the Elder was suceeded by his second son Ælfweard (904-924) on 17th July 924, while Athelstan inherited the sub kingdom of Mercia. Ælfweard, who was probably never crowned, died on 2nd August, 924 at Oxford, possibly on the orders of Athelstan, who then succeeded to the throne of all England. William of Malmesbury describes Athelstan as being fair haired, slender and of middle height.

Conspiracies against the new king's rule formed in the early months of Athelstan's reign, lead by one Alfred, who was probably a member of the Saxon Royal House. The Kings brother, Edwin, was in 933 accused of being party to this conspiracy, despite his strong protestations to the contrary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Athelstan strongly suspected his brother of complicity and became resolved to be rid of him. To spare the King the neccessity of having him executed, the unfortunate Edwin was sent to sea in a leaking old boat without a sail and with neither water or provisions. Dreading the prospect of drifting and starving to death, Edwin threw himself into the sea and drowned. Athelstan was said to later regret his conduct in the matter and did penance for this action.

The complete supremacy of the House of Wessex was firmly established under Athelstan and he could correctly be described as the first true King of all England. Athelstan used the title Basilius, the Greek term for king. 

Much of his reign was occupied, as were his forefather's, with the ongoing struggle with the Viking invaders. Athelstan concluded a treaty with them at Tamworth, by the terms of which he married his sister, Edith, to the Danish leader Sithric, King of York. Sithric died the following year and Athelstan siezed the opportunity to take Northumbria. His kingdom thereby became roughly equivalent in size to modern England. 

The Celtic Princes of Wales paid homage to him at Bamburgh in the early part of his reign, along with Hywel, King of Cornwall, Constantine II, King of Scots and Owen of Gwent. Athelstan succeeded in expelling the Cornish from Exeter and established the border with Cornwall as the River Tamar.

In the year 937, Constantine II of Scotland in alliance with Eógan of Strathclyde and Olaf Guthfrithson, King of Dublin, invaded England. The King marched a n army north to meet them, gaining a glorious victory at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937, against a combined invasion force of Vikings and Scots. The Annals of Ulster record the battle as:-

' a great battle, lamentable and terrible was cruelly fought...in which fell uncounted thousands of the Northmen. ... And on the other side, a multitude of Saxons fell; but Æthelstan, the king of the Saxons, obtained a great victory'

Brunaburh is thought to have been one of the bloodiest of the period. Five English kings and seven earls lost their lives in the carnage. The kings cousins Alfric and Athelwin and a prominent Saxon bishop were also among the casualties. The events of the battle are unclear, but according to some sources the West Saxons mounted a cavalry charge on the enemy, directly contradicting the popular belief that the early English fought on foot. Cavalry in the Saxon force were most likely to be mercenaries, however, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle itself makes no such mention of a cavalry charge and it is believed that the mention of the Saxons using cavalry has arisen through a mistranslation the Anglo-Saxon 'eorodcistum,' which means troop not cavalry. 

Constantine of Scotland fled the battlefield after his son was killed in the fighting. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records the King's resounding victory in the form of a jubilant poem in celebration of the event:-

'The hoary man of war had no cause to exult
in the clash of blades; he was shorn of his kinsmen,
deprived of friends, on the meeting place of peoples,
cut off in strife, and left his son
on the place of slaughter, mangled by wounds,
young in battle. The grey-haired warrior,
old crafty one, had no cause to boast' 
Despite its fame, the site of the battle remains uncertain and theories have been debated linking it to several sites including Burnswark in south west Scotland, Tinsley Wood near Sheffield, Yorkshire and Axminster in Devon, however Bromborough on the Wirral Peninsula remains the most likely candidate. This battle remains one of great importance in British history since Athelstan's utter and crushing defeat of the combined Norse-Celtic force ranged against him irrevocably confirmed England as an Anglo-Saxon kingdom, forcing the Celtic kingdoms to consolidate in the positions they have occupied top the present day.

Political alliances were arranged through the marriages of the King's sisters, .He married one of his many sisters to Sithric Cáech (meaning the 'Squinty'), the Viking King of Yorvik (York) the marriage took place at Tamworth and resulted in Sithric acknowledging Athelstan as over-king and converting to Christianity. His sister Edith was married to the Holy Roman Emperor, Otto I and another sister, Edgifu became Queen of France through her marriage to Charles the Simple. He also married one of his sisters to the Viking Egil Skallagrimson, the subject of an Icelandic saga and a further sister's marriage forged a political alliance with Alan II of Brittany.

Athelstan was an able administrator and made many good laws, which combated theft, oppression and fraud and mitigated severity to young offenders. He was charitable and popular and like his great-grandfather Ethelwulf, made provisions for his poorer subjects. Athelstan directed that each of the manors owned by the crown should be subject to an annual charge, which should be used to relieve the poor and the destitute. The Annals of Ulster refer to him as 'a pillar of dignity in the western world'. 

King Athelstan died on 27th October, 940, at Gloucester, aged forty-four, after a sixteen year reign and chose to be buried at Malmesbury Abbey in Wiltshire, a favourite of his, in preference to his family mausoleum at Winchester. Although his tomb still survives, his body was lost decades after his death. 

William of Malmesbury wrote of him two hundred years later ' The firm opinion is still current among the English that no one more just or learned administered the state.'

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Level or Scale of Measure ==
Mainstream statistics recognises four levels or scales of measure.  These are
# Nominal
# Ordinal
# Interval 
# Ratio (combined with Interval as ''Scale'' in SPSS)
These are in order from most name-like to most number-like.  
Each level has its own characteristics and association with a set of permissible statistical procedures.  Below, the level will be characterised and associated with one or more measures of central tendency, viz., mode, mean, and median.

==Nominal Data==
The Nominal level of measure is used for ''categorical'' data, where each value has each been assigned to a discrete category.  For instance, eye color of participants in a study might be nominally (from Latin ''nomen'' for name) categorised into groups
* brown
* blue
* green
* other

The only procedure for quantitative analysis of these data is counting, to discover frequencies of occurrence.  That is, how many individuals are assigned to each category.  The categories are often ''coded'' numerically (i.e., assigned a unique number) and named (using the ''values'' attribute of the variable).

The only measure of central tendency for nominal data is the [[w:mode (statistics)|mode]], which is the most frequently occurring category.  Note that there is no guarantee that a sample will produce a unique modal value.

==Ordinal Data==
The Ordinal level of measure is used for data which form discrete categories and can be naturally ranked on some scale.  This ranking is a weak ordering of the data in that two values may share the same rank: the relative rank of ''a'' and ''b'' is

* ''a'' &lt; ''b'' or
* ''a'' &gt; ''b'' or
* ''a'' = ''b''

An example of ordinal data is income grouping.  While income might be treated as a scalar variable, it is often useful to create categories out of income ranges.  For example, the following groupings have been suggested by the Office of National Statistics&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite paper

 |title=Harmonised Concepts and Questions for Social Data Sources:
Secondary Standards
 |url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/about-statistics/harmonisation/secondary-concepts-and-questions/S4.pdf
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Income to Income Band Coding
|-
! Income Range Floor !! Income Range Ceiling !! Possible Band Code
|-
| Lowest in data || £5,199 || 1
|-
| £5,200 || £10,399 || 2
|-
| £10,400 || £15,599 || 3
|-
| £15,600  || £20,799 || 4
|-
| £20,800 || £25,999 || 5
|-
| £26,000 || £31,199 || 6
|-
| £31,200 || £36,399 || 7
|-
| £36,400  || £51,999 || 8
|}

(I might add a ninth band to deal with all cases with income over £51,999)

As with nominal data, these groupings might each be represented by a numeric code.

The central tendency in ordinal data may be represented by the [[w:mode (statistics)|''mode'']] (defined above) and by the [[w:median|''median'']], the value that divides the data into equal halves.  This is the middle value when the cases are odd-numbered.  Else, the median is usually taken to be the arithmetic mean (see below) of the two middle values.

The differences between the rank levels of this scale cannot be measured or compared:  while we know that, of ordinal data points a, b, and c, '''a&lt;b''', '''b&lt;c''', and '''a&lt;c''', we do not know if the distance '''ab''' is equal to the distance '''bc'''.

==Scale Data==
===Interval Data===
Interval data values can be ordered and the distances between them compared.  However, the zero point of interval data is arbitrary.  An oft quoted example is the measure of temperature on the Celsius scale.  Here, the freezing point of water is arbitrarily assigned the value zero and the boiling point of water is arbitrarily assigned the value 100.  While 50° is indicated half way between these two marks on the scale, it is not coherently ''half the boiling point of water''. You cannot, for example, logically modify a recipe by halving the indicated oven temperature and doubling the cooking time.

===Ratio Data===
Ratio data is all of: ordered, of comparable distance (successive, integral points on the scale are equally spaced), and on a scale with a true zero point.  

For example, consider the measurement of height in meters: some objects have no elevation, which naturally maps to a height of zero meters.  

The values can also form ratios, such that any value can be expressed as a ratio of other values.  If we find, for example, three people of heights 1.5m, 1.75m and 2m, we can express any one of these as a multiple of any other.

&lt;br/&gt;
The central tendency in scale data can be indicated by the mode, the median and the [[w:mean | arithmetic mean]].  

The first two are discussed above.  

The arithmetic mean is the sum of all the data values divided by the number of data points.  In other words, it is what is commonly referred to as the average.

      <text xml:space="preserve">K3D objects features a number of user definable properties. They can describe the object relative position from the origin and allow set-up of simple animations that increment one or more of the angles or position vector properties for the object over time. There are also a number of properties that describe how the object should be rendered by the engine:

The following properties describe the point around which the object should be rotated during animation - default is the origin at 0,0,0:
* aboutx (number) - x coordinate for the object rotation origin
* abouty (number) - y coordinate for the object rotation origin
* aboutz (number) - z coordinate for the object rotation origin

The following properties describe the initial rotatation angles for the object with respect to its rotation origin, default is zero degrees:
* otheta (number) - the initial angle in degrees to rotate the object around the X axis
* ophi (number) - the initial angle in degrees to rotate the object around the Y axis
* ogamma (number) - the initial angle in degrees to rotate the object around the Z axis

The following properties describe how the engine should modify the rotation per animation frame, default is no animation:
* addtheta (number) - degrees to add to the rotation around the X axis per animation frame
* addphi (number) - degrees to add to the rotation around the Y axis per animation frame
* addgamma (number) - degrees to add to the rotation around the Z axis per animation frame

The following properties describe the initial offset of the object in 3D space, this allows the object to be moved into a position, note that the rotation origin is then relative to this location, default is the origin at 0,0,0:
* offx (number) - object offset x coordinate
* offy (number) - object offset y coordinate
* offz (number) - object offset z coordinate

The following properties describe the velocity to be applied to the object offset position in the x,y,z axis per animation frame, used to automatically move the object to create simple animations when combined with the bmin/max properties below, default is no velocity:
* velx (number) - object velocity in the x axis
* vely (number) - object velocity in the y axis
* velz (number) - object velocity in the z axis

The following properties describe a virtual bounding box in which the object will be automatically &quot;bounced&quot; if it's offset location touches the edges of the box, this can be used to create simple 3D bouncing animations when combined with the velocity properties above, default is no bounding box defined:
* bminx, bminy, bminz, bmaxx, bmaxy, bmaxz (number) - bounding box x, y, z minimum and maximum coordinates

* scale (number) - describes a scaling factor to be applied to the points for the object before initial display. This is a one-time operation. It is generally used to scale up/down an object to fit the current canvas size. So you define an object once with a known size, and scale it before display for different animations etc. It does not actually move the observer closer to the object, just changes the size of the object. Default is 1.0.

The following properties modify how the object is rendered by the engine:
* drawmode (string) -&quot;point&quot; - only render the points of an object. &quot;wireframe&quot; - render the edges of an object as lines, &quot;solid&quot; - render the polygons of an objects as solid filled polygons.
* shademode (string) - &quot;plain&quot; - plain color rendering, no attempt to light source or shade the lines or polygons, this is the simplest rendering mode. &quot;depthcue&quot; - z-ordered depthcued color rendering - the engine will shade the object from light to dark (using the object color as the lightest color) based on the z-order of the points and also adjust the relative line thickness to make lines in the background look further away than lines closest to the observer. &quot;lightsource&quot; - lightsourced color rendering (only available for &quot;solid&quot; drawmode), by default the engine will shade the polygons based on the angle of the polygon surface from the observer, so as polygons turn further away from the observer, they will be shaded darker. As well as the default lighting, additional coloured lights can be added to generate cool lighting effects (which themselves can be moved and modified during animation). See K3D.LightSource object.
* color (Array) - default color of the object - used when &quot;plain&quot; shading mode is used for points, lines or polygons. Specified as RGB 0-255 values in an Array e.g. [255,255,255] is the white default color.

* perslevel (number) - perspective level multiplier - powers of 2 recommended, default is 512. This value controls how strong the perspective effect is for the 3D-&gt;2D projection. Lower values give a intense 3D look, higher values give a flatter looking 3D projection.
* linescale (number) - floating point scaling factor for &quot;wireframe&quot; drawing mode - use this to make wireframe edges of an object look thick or thin. Default value is 2.0 pixels.
* doublesided (boolean) - by default this value is false as for performance reasons the engine will not render polygons that are not facing the observer. Set this flag to true to always render all polygons, visible or otherwise. This is useful if you want to see the back faces of an object i.e. inside of a cube or similar.

Advanced rendering properties:
* recalulatenormals (boolean) - by default this value is false. K3D performs a one-time calculation of the polygon normal vectors so that the polygons are correctly lit and correctly removed if not visible. Set this flag to true only if you manipulate the points during an animation (via the callback method) as then the engine will then need to recalculate the normal vectors for each frame.
* fillstroke (boolean) - due to the way in which HTML5 canvas fills shapes, if you place two polygons exactly next to each other and render them, there will be a small 0.5 pixel thick gap between the polygons. This leads to a &quot;cracking&quot; effect that makes some objects look like they have thin holes in. To fix this, the engine can render each polygon twice, which causes canvas to &quot;overdraw&quot; the anti-aliased edges of the polygons, this is the fastest way to fix the problem. Set this property to true and the engine will double fill the polygons to fix the cracking effect. However this is a relatively expensive operation and will slow down the rendering.
* depthscale (number) - when using depthcued rendering mode, this value controls the &quot;middle point&quot; for the depthcue/perspective scaling calculation. By default it is set to the width of the canvas/2. Generally you will not need to modify this value.
* sortmode (boolean) - one of &quot;sorted&quot; or &quot;unsorted&quot;, default is &quot;sorted&quot;. Can be used to disable z-ordered sorting of objects before they are displayed. Generally you will not need to modify this value.


----
Thanks! Here were my guesses: o{phi,theta} are angles for the camera position. add{gamma,theta,phi} are angular animation increments when a callback isn't being used; about{x,y,z} could be axis coordinates or maybe something having to do with the camera position; scale could be the zoom; linescale and fillstroke have something to do with the width of wireframe and points (respectively?); doublesided perhaps means to render light on both sides of a face?; recalculatenormals hints that the callback might change the orientation of the face polygons. I see now that the boolean second argument to K3D.Controller disables click-to-pause.

===== What is cultural imperialism? Define and give an example. =====
Cultural imperialism is defined as the imposition of a foreign viewpoint or civilization on a people. &lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cultural+imperialism&lt;/ref&gt; However, cultural imperialism takes on several categorical forms.  For example, cultural imperialism theory states that Western nations dominate the media around the world which in return has a powerful effect on Third World Cultures by imposing on them Western views and therefore destroying their native cultures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uky.edu/~drlane/capstone/mass/imperialism.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A historical example of aggressive cultural imperialism occurred during the French and Indian War when Lord Jeffrey Amherst had smallpox infected blankets distributed to the Ottawa Indians in an attempt to &quot;extirpate or remove that vermine.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091210192224AA89WS8&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TODO|The smallpox infected blankets are not a example of cultural imperialism. The Indians  where not forced or motivated to alter any cultural trait, nor even where aware of the fact, it was an act of indiscriminate biological warfare against a civilian population, demonstrating technological supremacy and by today's standards amoral behavior.}}

===== What is cultural diffusion? Define and give an example.=====
Cultural diffusion refers to the spread of culture and the means for its occurrence. Cultural traits of one region spread to other communities by factors including communication, trade, and migration. This diffusion can be hierarchical or expansionist. The spread of American enterprises, such as McDonalds, is an example of cultural diffusion. Restaurants that feature the cuisines of other cultures (e.g. sushi)   in the United States are an example of cultural diffusion as well. There are social barriers to cultural diffusion which include language, religion, race, and physical barriers. To some observers, cultural diffusion is viewed as an intrusion, whereas others are comfortable with the spread of cultural traits &lt;ref&gt; (http://www.p12.nysed.gov/ciai/socst/grade3/geograph.html#diffusion)&lt;/ref&gt;.

===== What is cultural hegemony? Define and give an example. =====

The term cultural hegemony was first coined by Antonio Gramsci, a leading Italian Marxist.  He actually challenged the traditional Marxist theory with the role of force and coercion of the ruling class as one-sided. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-gram.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Gramsci went further to approach the role that the dominated class played in seemingly willing to submit, through manipulation and ideological control, to the cultural system put forward by the ruling class. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo101/glossary.html&lt;/ref&gt;   According to Gramsci, hegemony is only effective when paired with a domination that is both physical and psychological. Some powerful forms of cultural hegemony are religion and patriarchy. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/1860957 &lt;/ref&gt;

===== How do cultural imperialism and cultural diffusion interact? Explain why this might happen.=====
Cultural imperialism and cultural diffusion interact when diffusion of culture is done with intention to dominate the receiving culture and intensity. This may happen when one culture wishes to dominate another for economic, religious, and nationalistic reasons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Group 2: American Cultural Imperialism ==
'''''Directions:''' Divide the work up between your group members and remember to cite your sources.''
===== What are some possible examples of American cultural imperialism? =====
American cultural imperialism—roughly—takes on two structural forms: active and passive cultural imperialism.  Passive cultural imperialism is a softer than the more direct, active cultural imperialism and, as such, requires that “the receiving culture adopts the foreign values without perceiving the fact that they are, in fact, becoming slaves of a foreign culture.”  Examples of passive American cultural imperialism include (but are not limited to) the wide array of consumer products available around the world: e.g. McDonalds, Disney, Hollywood, and the values perpetuated on American television.   Active cultural imperialism is one nation’s direct control over another whereby the dominant nation’s culture is reproduced in the less-dominant culture by active force.  Examples of active American cultural imperialism are the conquering of Indigenous peoples in the America’s by European settlers, the foreign policy of the U.S. which promotes neo-liberal economic policies, and the military and economic consequences the U.S. imposes upon nations who are not receptive to the global agenda of the United States.  A large gray area exists between passive and active cultural imperialism.  Should Peace Corps volunteers and Christian missionaries be considered active or passive imperialists? http://www.tbsjournal.com/Archives/Spring01/white.html

===== What is Consumerism? =====
Consumerism is a social and economic order that is based on the systematic creation and fostering of a desire to purchase goods and services in ever greater amounts. The term is often associated with criticisms of consumption starting with Thorstein Veblen. Veblen's subject of examination, the newly emergent middle class arising at the turn of the twentieth century, comes to full fruition by the end of the twentieth century through the process of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerism&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, there are wide inequalities among consumers.  In 2005, the world’s wealthiest 20% consumed 76.6% of the total private consumption.  In comparison, the world’s poorest 20% consumed 1.5%.
More specifically, the resource consumption for the world’s richest fifth can be seen below:

* Consume 45% of all meat and fish, the poorest fifth 5%
* Consume 58% of total energy, the poorest fifth less than 4%
* Have 74% of all telephone lines, the poorest fifth 1.5%
* Consume 84% of all paper, the poorest fifth 1.1%
* Own 87% of the world’s vehicle fleet, the poorest fifth less than 1%&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalissues.org/issue/235/consumption-and-consumerism&lt;/ref&gt;

===== What is Dependency Theory? =====
Dependency theory is a body of social science theories that are grounded in the idea that resources from impoverished, underdeveloped countries are removed and used by wealthy “core” countries, increasing the wealth of the wealthy states while exploiting the poor states. Developed in reaction to modernization theory, dependency theory first gained popularity in the late 1950’s.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_theory&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic premises of dependency theory include:
	
# Poor countries provide natural resources, cheap labor, and markets for wealthier countries, without these, the latter could not enjoy the standards of living that they do.
# Wealthy nations work to keep poorer countries in a state of dependence through a variety of means, including debt accumulation, political influence and media control. 
# Poor countries are not “behind” or “catching up” to wealthy countries. They are poor because they were “coercively integrated into the European economic system only as producers of raw materials or to serve as repositories of cheap labor, and were denied the opportunity to market their resources in any way that competed with dominant states.”
# When impoverished countries do try to counter the effects of exploitative wealthier states, their attempts are actively resisted through economic sanctions and military force.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/depend.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

===== How might the theories dependency and consumerism interact? Explain why this interaction might happen. =====
Dependency theory serves to promote inequality amongst global consumers. Consumerism creates unequal conditions in which the world’s wealthiest exploit the most impoverished. Thus, dependency theory and consumerism work in tandem to keep the wealthy on top and the poor at the bottom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Group 3: Cultural Imperialism in America ==
'''''Directions:''' Divide the work up between your group members and remember to cite your sources.''
===== What is acculturation? Give an example of acculturation that you see within the dominant American culture. =====

Acculturation is brought about through continuous contact between two different groups or individuals with different cultures. The result being cultural features are exchanged and modified while the groups still stay distinct or separate. Usually one culture is dominant.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acculturation &lt;/ref&gt; 

One example often referenced and research of acculturation are minority groups in the U.S. While a rather simple definition, many refer to this as “trying to fit into the dominant culture while still maintaining ones individual culture. Research has shown that the stress of acculturation may be so high that it leads to self-directed violence or youth violence. For an overview of current research see Medscape Today&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/708635_7&lt;/ref&gt;.  Dress attire and clothing in general is often a common example of acculturation. For example , Native Americans often wore European attire to try and fit in.

===== What is cultural assimilation? Give an example of cultural assimilation that you see within the United States. =====

Cultural assimilation is the socio-political phenomenon which works to incorporate minority groups into the dominant culture. It is the opposite of the “multicultural” approach. Cultural assimilation works to eliminate differences between cultures and instead take on the majority opinion.  The Free Dictionary says cultural assimilation is, “a process by which members of an ethnic minority group lose cultural characteristics that distinguish them from the dominant cultural group or take on the cultural characteristics of another group.”&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.triastelematica.org/index.php/Cultural_assimilation&lt;/ref&gt;  


One example of cultural assimilation that is visible in the United States is immigrants moving from around the world and they are expected to speak English and follow our cultural traditions.

===== What is cultural resistance or backlash? Give an example that you see within the United States. =====

1. a sudden, forceful backward movement; recoil. 
2. a strong or violent reaction, as to some social or political change: a backlash of angry feeling among Southern conservatives within the party.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/backlash?fromAsk=true&amp;o=100074 &lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Some examples in American history are the rise of the KKK during the 1960’s Civil Rights Movement&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kkk&lt;/ref&gt;, the wave of anti-immigration feeling today, and the Civil War. Additionally, some examples in world history are; the Spanish Inquisition (as a backlash against the multi-religion region after the reconquest of the Iberian peninsula)&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_inquisition&lt;/ref&gt; anti-capitalist, anti-American terrorists, the recent protests and coups in the Middle East (Egypt, Yemen), and the Holocaust.

===== 1) What is globalization? How does globalization effect culture?=====
===== 2) Does U.S. cultural imperialism exist, and, if yes, in what ways? ===== 
===== 3) If no, are we simply witnessing the development of a &quot;global&quot; culture that currently happens to be largely influenced by the United States? ===== 
===== 4) Or, will increased nationalism maintain separate and distinct cultures, with no one culture being dominant? =====

The last couple of users I have blocked seem to share a modus operandi.  Perhaps they are the same person?
*[[User:Termitecontrol11]]
*[[User:Web75copywriters]]
Also, this guy (who I warned rather than blocked)
*[[User:Best76seller]]

I just find it suspicious that they are all linking to small businesses on a User page, and that the user name has a number in it. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 04:28, 26 July 2011 (UTC)
:Not from the same IP, but the last two are on the same ISP, with the last individual from a [http://whatismyipaddress.com/ip/124.6.181.173 confirmed proxy], thereby suggesting a hard block of the IP is warranted.  Since I went through the trouble of a check and there will be no collateral damage, underlying IP blocks for all. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:39, 26 July 2011 (UTC)</text>

=== Usage ===
This is a template for adding examples to a book.

*the first parameter (nameless) is the example text. If left blank it creates a request for expansion.
*the second parameter (nameless) is the example's title.
*the third parameter is '''cite''' expects a citation
:* idealy it would take the form: cite=&lt;nowiki&gt;{{RCV|nid=fNorthByNorthWest
     |people= Lehman E. (Writer); Hitchcock, A. (Director)
     |date=1959|title=North by Northwest
     |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053125/
     |medium=Motion picture}} }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
::but the following would work as well &lt;nowiki&gt;cite=Hitchcock, A. (Director). (1956). The Man Who Knew Too Much [Motion Picture].&lt;/nowiki&gt;
note: to avoid errors with cite the page must have a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;references goup=&quot;f&quot;/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag near the bottom. if the first type is used 
and a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;references /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; if the second type is used.

      <comment>Copied and pasted from &quot;Elemetary Urdu&quot; page; I'm not sure how else to change the article's title.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Have you ever had a child? If yes, then you'd know how inquisitive their little minds are. If you haven't had any kids, try remembering yourself as a toddler. It isn't hard enough to note that children usually start talking by asking simple questions like ‘'''what''' is this?’ and ‘'''where''' is that thing?’ We will start learning the Urdu in a very similar way: asking questions.
__TOC__
==Basic interrogation==
If Paul is to ask what a certain thing is, he'd say: '''what is this?''' It is pretty much how things work in Urdu with a slight change however. To learn Urdu, you would have to think in Urdu. When asking a question, a speaker, of say English, would use a special word called the [[w:Interrogative word|interrogative word]] which in Paul's example is '''what'''. If broken down, the simple question that Paul asked would appear as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Interrogative word
! [[w:Auxiliary verb|Auxiliary verb]]
! Object
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | What
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | is
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | this
|}

In the example above, we clearly see that the question begins with an interrogative word (what, where, when, etc.), followed by an auxiliary or helping verb and then comes the object. In Urdu grammar however things work a bit differently. Try looking at the same example in a different perspective.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Object
! Interrogative word
! Auxiliary verb
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | This
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | what
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | is
|}

This might seem incorrect grammatically in English, but this is actually the correct sequence of syntax when asking a question in Urdu. The object comes first with the auxiliary verb at the end and anything else (the interrogative word in this case) between the two. In Urdu, following question would be the equivalent of the question Paul asked.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!
! Object
! Interrogative word
! Auxiliary verb
|-
! Latinised
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | '''Yeh'''&lt;br /&gt;{{Pronounced|yeɪ}}
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | '''kya'''&lt;br /&gt;{{Pronounced|k·yɑː}}
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | '''hai'''&lt;br /&gt;{{Pronounced|hæ}}
|-
! Urdu
| یہ
| کیا
| ہے
|}

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer since things work a little different here.
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

I've looked at the Atheism 3.0 page and hope you are going somewhere with it, more than a encyclopedic-like article. In any case I've found the subject interesting, especially since it somewhat demonstrates an invested effort by the clergy in the matter. I doubt that it is more than a buzz word or label since atheists aren't card carriers that see their position about religious beliefs as at all important unless it infringes on their rights or freedoms. 

Good luck! --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 06:50, 26 July 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== External links ==

I approved the addition of an external link on this page, because it's practically all external links anyway. Never the less, I suspect that it's being treated as a free source of links by a number of owners of the web sites linked to. At some point, I think this should be cleaned up. Possibly someone needs to go through each site and take editorial responsibility for whether it adds to the book or not. An alternative would be to only allow links that have been added by someone with a user account on Wikibooks who has made non-trivial contributions in their own right. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 10:00, 26 July 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>basic betting of blocked areas</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I like to use the idea of blocking certain areas of the wheel with combo bets.   The American wheel and table are designed to allow you to block both sides of the wheel with the minimum of bets.   Using split bets, cover 5-6, 17-18, 20-21, 19-22, 31-32.  you get 2 blocks on the wheel of 5 numbers each at 180 degrees, so no matter which side is 'hot' your bound to be in it.  You need 2 hits per 7 spins on average to break even, so wait for that 4 out of 5 or 6 out of 8 stretch and get out.   $5 gets you $18 (17+1).  pay pct(5 bet/18 pay=26.3%) hit pct(10 played/38 numbers=27.7%).  It's about the best you can get on an American Roulette wheel.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Creating Labels for Variables and Values=
==Variable Labels==
SPSS variable names are restricted as to length and allowable characters.  The length available is dependent upon the value of the UNICODE parameter.  Most users will probably not wish to change this themselves and since the default allows 64 character variable names for English and other single byte languages and 32 characters for two byte languages, this is generally enough.  Bit it is not always convenient to give variables human friendly names, however long.  For this reason SPSS allows the users to create ''labels'' for variables.  A label is created by filling in the appropriate ''label'' row in variable view.  The label rather than the variable name will be used by default for output and can be set as the display for variable view by selecting ''view  → value labels'' from the menus.

==Value Labels==
Let us suppose that we have a variable representing eye colour.  We have called the variable '''iColour''', given it the lable ''Eye Colour'' and we have coded observations as follows
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! iColour !! Code
|-
| Brown || 1
|-
| Blue || 2
|-
| Green || 3
|-
| Other || 4
|}
Coding categorical data as numbers is elegant but the user may find it easier for data entry and reading data to have the lexical values available.  This can be done using the ''values'' dialog.
In the appropriate row, put the cursor in the ''values'' cell and click on the expand dialog button (three dots).  In this dialog you enter pairs of values and labels for values.  After adding a value and its label, remember to click '''add''' before you add another or close the dialog.
When you have done, SPSS saves a list of ''{value,label}'' pairs that you have specified and can apply them for output and display.
As a bonus, after creating variable names you automatically create a drop down data entry menu for the variable if you are in vale labels view.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Coding for Missing Values=
There is a considerable literature on the treatment of missing data (see for example Allison (2001) for references&lt;ref name=&quot;MissingAllison&quot;&gt;{{cite book
|author= Allison, P. D. 
|date=(2001). 
|title=Missing data. 
|location=Thousand Oaks, CA
|publisher=Sage Publications.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and it is not my intention to deal with the methodological issues here.  Rather, I want to explain the missing values dialog in a little more detail.  Here is the dialog:

[[File:11creatingnewvariables08.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Notice that you can give up to three discrete integer or string values, or a range, to stand for missing data.  If you want to analyse the missing values you have in your data you may wish to use more than one indicator (for example, you may have choices ''missing at random'', ''missing completely at random'', and ''missing not at random''), but if you are only interested in eliminating these cases (data points), then a single indicator is enough.  

Note that if your variable is numeric, then your code indicating missing data must also be numeric.

Wherever possible, choose a missing value code that is ''logically impossible'' as a measured value of this variable.  For example, -1 for age.  You might consider using 999 as the missing code for age, as it is an improbable age, but it is better to designate the impossible rather than the improbable.  For string variables, you can use any string, e.g., ''NA'' for ''not applicable'', or plain ''missing''.

When you have completed the missing values dialog in Variable View, you must still input the data, as a variable's default ''missing'' value won't be your ''missing'' value.  It will instead be ''system missing'' in the case of numeric variables (indicated by a period), and a space for string variables.  

You can do this by hand if you only have a few ''missing'' instances.  First, sort the data on the variable concerned, so that the empty cells appear first, facilitating the task.

If you have a large number of missing data points, however, it is easier to ''recode'' the ''system missing'' data using ''Transform → Recode into the same variable'' dialog.  For numeric variables, on the left hand side of the dialog, choose ''system missing'' as the old value and, on the right hand side, your missing code as the new value.  For string data, instead of ''system missing'' as the old value, you would enter a space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Coding from Continuous to Discrete Values in SPSS/PAWS=

''please improve or delete''

It is not uncommon to transform a continuous variable (like income) to an ordinal using one of SPSS/PAWS' recode routines.  In these cases, new users sometimes have difficulty expressing the ''floor'' (lower bound) and ''ceiling'' (upper bound) values appropriately.  Here is the recommended system:

# Choose the '''''lowest through value''''' option and give this the lowest code
# Repeat
##choose the floor for a category and enter this value in the first text input box of the '''''range through''''' section of the dialog.  '''This value is ''greater than'' and any data at this value will be in the band below'''.
##choose the ceiling for the category and enter this in the second text input box of the '''''range through''''' section of the dialog.  '''This value is ''upto and including'' and any data at this value will be included in this band'''.
# Choose the highest through value option and gives this the code for your highest ranked band.

So, at each boundary, you specify the upper bound of one level with the same value as the lower bound of the next.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Proofreading==
This sentence: &quot;Variable names can be at least 31 characters long, though modern compilers will always support longer names.&quot; is confusing. Should it instead say &quot;at most 31 characters long&quot;? Also, it seems like there should be some data or standard for when the maximum length was 31. [[User:Jackhill|Jackhill]] ([[User talk:Jackhill|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jackhill|contribs]]) 18:08, 26 July 2011 (UTC)

== Some clarification required ==

The sentence ''&quot;The name of a structure defines a variable, not an address. If the name of a structure is passed to a function, the function works only on its local copy of the structure. To return values, an address must be specified:&quot;'' on it own with the current one-liner example code is quite hard to grasp without further explanation or a more extensive example. I had to re-read it multiple times and still I'm not 100% sure I understand what is meant by it. Using ''&quot;setstruct&quot;'' as an example function name adds even more to the confusion, since it might imply that it is a default available C function.

I would change the last sentence ''&quot;To return values, an address must be specified:&quot;'' to something like ''&quot;To have the called function alter the element values of a struct while the caller function has to continue to work on the altered values, the address of the struct must be given to the called function&quot;''. The values aren't actually 'returned' in the classical way, using the return statement.

A different example would explain it all:
&lt;PRE&gt;
   ...
   int main()
   {
     struct person m;                         /* Declare an instance of it. */
     strcpy( m.name, &quot;Coyote, Wile E.&quot; );     /* Initialize it. */
     m.age = 31;
     
     alter_age( m );
     printf( &quot;Age:  %d\n&quot;, m.age );           /* Still displays 31. */
     
     alter_age( &amp;m );                         /* Note the use of '&amp;'. */
     printf( &quot;Age:  %d\n&quot;, m.age );           /* Displays 42. */
     
     return 0;
   }
   
   void alter_age( struct person p )
   {
     p.age = 42;
   }
&lt;/PRE&gt;
[[User:Prodoc|Prodoc]] ([[User talk:Prodoc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Prodoc|contribs]]) 15:10, 2 August 2011 (UTC)
:I agree that it is confusing and should be clarified.  However, the alternate example provided here would not work (and mightnot compile) because alter_age() requires a struct, and cannot take a pointer to a struct.  It might be better to offer two examples - one that works, and one that does not:

'''Example of code that will not work as intended'''
&lt;code lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
   int main()
   {
     struct person m;                         /* Declare an instance of it. */
     strcpy( m.name, &quot;Coyote, Wile E.&quot; );     /* Initialize it. */
     m.age = 31;
     
     alter_age( m );
     printf( &quot;Age:  %d\n&quot;, m.age );           /* Still displays 31. */
     
     return 0;
   }
   
   void alter_age( struct person p )
   {
     p.age = 42;
   }
&lt;/code&gt;

'''Example of code that ''will'' work as intended'''
&lt;code lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
   int main()
   {
     struct person m;                         /* Declare an instance of it. */
     strcpy( m.name, &quot;Coyote, Wile E.&quot; );     /* Initialize it. */
     m.age = 31;
     
     alter_age( &amp;m );
     printf( &quot;Age:  %d\n&quot;, m.age );           /* Correctly displays 42. */
     
     return 0;
   }
   
   void alter_age( struct person *p )
   {
     p-&gt;age = 42;
   }
&lt;/code&gt;

::Good point, of course my example will not work. Hey, I'm not reading a C primer for no reason ;-) With some form of emphasis in the characters &quot;&amp;&quot; and &quot;*&quot;, in the code itself or as a separate note, the two examples would be perfect. [[User:Prodoc|Prodoc]] ([[User talk:Prodoc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Prodoc|contribs]]) 15:27, 3 August 2011 (UTC)

== Missing pointer topic explanation and/or error(s)? ==

I just noticed two more issues which are not dealt with.
# Pointer indication before a function, like the example containing &quot;*strtest&quot;
# Pointer indication behind a function parameter, like the example containing &quot;struct v*&quot; (three times).

The first issue is valid, but what is its purpose? Why and when should you use this? If it's outside of the scope of the book, it should not be used in an example imho.
The second issue looks to me to be an error.

Is it my impression or int and float are machine dependent or implementation (they can be 16 or 32 bits, or 8 in case of the float, but not size guaranteed).   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 07:12, 17 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Creating Normal Maps with Blender 2.5 for Trainz Assets==

=== Purpose ===
To demonstrate how to create a normal mapped object in Blender using the Blender Bake option.  The object is exported from Blender and imported into Trainz as a new scenery asset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
=== Programs and Items Used ===
==== Essential ====
:* Blender 2.5 (2.58.0)&lt;br /&gt;
:* Blender Trainz Exporter (2.57 version)&lt;br /&gt;
:* Trainz Simulator 12 (build 47059)  (TS9 and TS10 should also work but have not been tested by the author)&lt;br /&gt;
:* A colour texture file in uncompressed TGA format.  Just a black, red or blue file will suffice.  It must comply with the standard for texture files for Trainz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
==== Desirable ====
:* Objects from Paul Hobbs’  Bits Box http://www.44090digitalmodels.co.uk/bitsbox/cab_controls.html&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Expected Result ===
At the completion of this tutorial you should have the following asset in Trainz.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Blender normal mapped cube in Trainz.jpg|center|800px|Blender normal mapped cube in Trainz]]&lt;br /&gt;

=== Introduction ===
This tutorial demonstrates how to simulate rivets on a flat plate using a material created from a normal map texture and a simple diffuse (coloured) texture.  The material is then applied to the sides of a simple cube that is used as a scenery asset in Trainz.&lt;br /&gt;

There are some actions in the steps below that may differ from your normal approach to content creation in Trainz.  That's OK.  Just use whatever method suits you.  The tutorial method of copying asset files from a working folder into a Trainz editing folder is only for simplicity.  The author uses PEV's AssetX program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=AssetX|web|url=http://www.members.optusnet.com.au/~villaump/pevsoft.htm|publisher=PEVSoft|accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to manage that process.&lt;br /&gt;
 
The tutorial uses layers in Blender to move objects out of the way temporarily.  The numbering of these layers is contained in the Blender Manual&lt;ref name=&quot;Doc:Manual/3D interaction/Navigating/Layers&quot;&gt;{{cite|title=3D interaction, Navigating, Layers| web|url=http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Manual/3D_interaction/Navigating/Layers|work=Blender Manual|publisher=Blender Foundation|accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Basically the 10 layer boxes on the top row are numbered 1 to 10 and the bottom row from 11 to 20.&lt;br /&gt;

Some actions in the tutorial require you to be in Object Mode or Edit Mode.  To ensure you are in the correct mode, the tutorial will remind you of the correct mode.&lt;br /&gt;


=== Assumptions and Prerequisite Knowledge ===
:* Experience with creating objects in Blender and use of the Blender exporter for Trainz.
:* Experience with creating assets in Trainz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

=== Before You Start ===
You will need a rivet mesh for this exercise.  For Trainz purposes a rivet can simply be a half sphere and the easiest way to get a suitable rivet is to download the Bits Box (Cab Controls) from Paul Hobbs’ site.  There is a rivet.blend file in the collection that is suitable.  Place a copy of rivet.blend in a known location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

=== Method ===
==== Step 1 – Create Trainz asset ====
:* Open Trainz Content Manager and create a new scenery asset.   Change the asset name to “Normal Test”.   Keep a note of the KUID number and save the asset.  You can ignore the errors since we do not yet have a mesh.  Exit Content Creator Plus.&lt;br /&gt;

:* Commit the asset, ignore the errors and open it for edit again.  This will update the asset name and ensure the asset is correctly named in the editing folder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==== Step 2 – Create Blender environment ====
:* In your Blender user area create a new folder and call it “Normal Test”.
:* Copy the config.txt from the “…\Auran\...\UserData\Editing\Normal Test” folder into your new Blender folder.  We will edit the config.txt later.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==== Step 3 – Create low and high poly meshes ====

===== Create the basic meshes =====

:* Start Blender and save the default project as Normal_Test.blend in your Blender Normal_Test folder.
::''''' Object Mode '''''
:* The normal cube is a bit big so scale it to 0.5 in all axes or just resize the X,Y and Z dimensions to 1.
:* Change the Z location value to bring the bottom of the cube to the level of the grid floor.
:* Apply scale and location to the cube (Ctrl A).
:* Move the cube to layer 6.  We will use it later.
:* Position the 3D cursor at zero (0,0,0) (Shift C).
:* Add a new plane mesh and call it “lo poly”.
:* Change to top view using the 7 numpad key.
:* Resize using the dimensions values or scale the plane to a one Blender unit square.
:* Apply the scale.  This is also required if you resized the plane using dimension values.
:* In the Properties Editor, select the Object Data icon (the triangle), open the Normals twisty and deselect Double Sided.  This isn’t strictly necessary but the exporter will warn about it.
:* In the 3D Editor select the lo poly mesh and create a duplicate with Shift D.  Press escape to avoid moving the new mesh.
:* Rename the duplicate mesh from “lo poly.001” to “hi poly”.
:* Move the hi poly mesh to layer 1 and then select layer 1 so we can work on the hi poly mesh.
:* Save the Blender file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:2-The resized cube.jpg|center|800px|The Resized Cube]]

===== Modify the hi poly mesh =====

::''''' Object Mode '''''
:* Import the rivet mesh into your working Blender file.  In detail:
::* File-&gt;Append 
::* Select the rivet.blend file
::* Object-&gt;Rivet
::* Link/Append from Library&lt;br /&gt;

:* The append command places the rivet at location 0,0,0 but it will need to be rotated minus 90 degrees on the Y axis.
:* Select the rivet and change the Y Rotation value to -90.
:* Then press Ctrl A and then Apply Rotation to set this placement as the standard orientation.
:* The imported rivet is 0.02 Blender units which is roughly ¾ inch.  You could rescale the rivet to about 0.025 which is roughly 1 inch.  This might make the rivet more visible in Trainz.  Experiment with different sizes to find a rivet size that suits you.  The dimension values for a one inch rivet are X = 0.025, Y = 0.25 and Z = 0.0125.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:3-Rivet resized to 1 inch.jpg|center|800px|Rivet resized to one inch]]
&lt;br /&gt;
:* Move the rivet to the top left corner of the plate and use it to create additional rivets in any pattern you prefer.  You can duplicate the rivet by selecting the rivet, followed by Shift D then either X or Y.  The X or Y allows you to move the duplicated rivet along either of those axes.   Once you have 2 or 3 rivets just select all of them and duplicate as required. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:4-Lots of rivets.jpg|center|800px|Lots of rivets!]]
&lt;br /&gt;
:* When you have created all the required rivets, select them, but not the plane, and form a single mesh using Ctrl J.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

'''Warning!'''   You also need to join the rivets mesh with the hi poly mesh but, if you select the hi poly mesh last, all the rivets will be flattened.  This is probably because the hi poly mesh is a simple plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

:* Select the hi poly mesh first and then the rivets mesh and join using Ctrl J.  Check the join is OK by looking at a side view (numpad 3).  The rivets should be visible above the plane.
:* Change back to top down view.
:* The mesh name will have changed so rename the mesh back to “hi poly”.
:* Save the Blender file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We are now ready to create the material and normal texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==== Step 4 – Create material and normal texture ====

::''''' Object Mode '''''
:* Change to layer 1 and select the lo poly mesh.
:* Open the UV/Image Editor in another panel.  Create one if you do not have one visible.  Create a new image called “rivets_normal” (Image-&gt;New Image) using a 512 * 512 size.  Leave alpha checked and check 32 bit float.
:* Select the lo poly mesh and select the material icon in the Properties Editor.&lt;br /&gt;

:''Material Settings''
::* Create a new material called “rivets.m.tbumptex”. 
::* Change the Specular settings to Blinn shader and intensity 0.2.
::* Change the Shading-&gt;Emit to 0.5.
::* Leave other settings unchanged.
::* ''Note: These settings gave a reasonable result in Trainz.  This is one area you could experiment with different settings to improve your result.''
::* In the Properties Editor select the textures icon.&lt;br /&gt;

:''Normal Texture Settings''
::* Create a new texture called “normal” using the Image or Movie type.
::* In the Image twisty, select the leftmost button (Browse image to be linked) and select rivets_normal from the list.
::* ''Note:  This uses the “generated” image within Blender.  This may need to be changed to an external file once the final normal map has been created.''
::* In Image Sampling select Normal map and leave other settings unchanged.
::* In Mapping change the Coordinates setting to UV.
::* In Influence deselect Diffuse-&gt;Color and select Geometry-&gt;Normal.
:* Save the Blender file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We are now ready to commence the baking process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
==== Step 5 – Bake normal map ====

::''''' Object Mode '''''
:* Go to layer 2 and move the hi poly mesh to layer 1.
:* Move to Layer 1 and select the lo poly mesh.
:* Move to Edit Mode (tab) and ensure you have Face Select Mode selected.
::''''' Edit Mode '''''
:* Unwrap the mesh (U-&gt;Unwrap) and the mesh will be projected onto the rivets_normal image.  As there is only one face on the lo poly mesh it just fills the image.
:* Return to Object Mode.&lt;br /&gt;
::''''' Object Mode '''''
:* Ensure you are in Blender Render mode.  This mode is displayed in the Blender Information panel – usually at the top of the main Blender window.
:* Select the Render icon (the camera) in the Properties Editor.
:* Close off all the sub window “twisties” and open up the Bake sub window.&lt;br /&gt;

:* The settings for the Bake window are:
::* Bake Mode -&gt; Normals
::* Bake from multires -&gt; unchecked
::* Normal Space -&gt; Tangent
::* Clear -&gt; checked
::* Selected to Active -&gt; checked
::* Margin -&gt; 2
::* Distance -&gt; 0
::* Split -&gt; Automatic
::* Bias -&gt; 0.08 (see note 2)&lt;br /&gt;

:* Select the hi poly mesh and then Shift select the lo poly mesh.   Ensure that the lo poly mesh is the active mesh as we will be baking from the selected mesh to the active mesh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:5-Ready to bake.jpg|center|1000px|Ready to bake]]
&lt;br /&gt;
:* Select the Bake option and you should see the rivets_normal image converted to a normal map.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:6-After baking.jpg|center|1000px|After baking]]
&lt;br /&gt;
:* Go to the UV/Image Editor window and save the normal map image (save as image) as a raw Targa file with the name rivets_normal.tga.  The &quot;raw Targa&quot; file type can be selected from the file types in the Save as Image twisty on the left hand side of the window.  Check the save location as Blender tends to try and save the file in the root directory of your C: drive.
:* Move the hi poly mesh to layer 2.  This is done so the mesh is not included in the exported IM file for Trainz.
:* Select the lo poly mesh.  Note we cannot see the rivets on the object yet.
:* In the Properties Editor, select the normal texture and reload the rivets_normal file from disk.  See Note 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Note 1:  If you have packed the image into Blender the reload option will be unavailable.  If this has occurred you will need to unlock the data block.  But if you followed the instructions above this will not be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;

Note 2:  The default Bias value is zero which, if unchanged may result in a splatter effect of bumps.  This was the value chosen by video tutorials that the author observed.  You can experiment with different values to see which gives the best effect.  The result probably depends on the type of bumps and depressions being modelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
==== Step 6 – Create diffuse material ====

:* Select the lo poly mesh in the 3D Editor.
:* In the Properties Editor select the textures icon.
:* Create a new texture called “diffuse” using the Image or Movie type.  Load your simple one colour texture file.  This example uses the black.tga file common to many models.
:* Change the Mapping-&gt;Coordinates to UV.
:* The Influence-&gt;Color should be checked which is the default.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

At this point you could just export the lo poly mesh to Trainz but it would appear as a plane.   A more interesting object is a normal mapped cube so we will use the cube for our export.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
==== Step 7 – Create riveted box ====

::''''' Object Mode '''''
:* Move to layer 6 or the layer containing the cube.
:* Select the cube and then go to the Properties Editor and choose the Material icon.   If there is an existing material then remove it.
:* Apply the rivets.m.tbumptex material to the cube.
:* Change to edit mode.
::''''' Edit Mode '''''
:* Select all faces of the cube and unwrap the cube to map against the rivets_normal image.
:* If necessary, move and resize each cube face to take up the entire rivets_normal image.
:* Change to object mode.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
==== Step 8 – Export model ====

::''''' Object Mode '''''
:* Save the Blender file.
:* Export using the Blender Trainz exporter.  You don’t need to change any of the exporter settings but make sure it is exporting into your Normal_Test folder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Assuming you have no errors, you are now ready to set up for importing into Trainz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==== Step 9 – Create or modify the config.txt file ====

:* Open the config.txt file within the normal_test folder using your preferred editor.  Add or change the file to reflect the sample config.txt below.  Remember not to remove or change the first line of the file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
kuid                  {your kuid number}
username              &quot;Normal Test&quot;
kind                  &quot;scenery&quot;
trainz-build          3.4  (or whatever was provided by your content manager)
mesh-table            {
                       default {
                                auto-create    1
                                mesh           &quot;normal_test.im&quot;
                               }
                      }
category-class        &quot;XVG&quot;
thumbnails            { 
                       0 {
                          image         &quot;$screenshot$.jpg&quot;
                          width         240
                          height        180
                         }
                      }
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note:  It is assumed you have a suitable thumbnail image.  You could delete or omit that section but TS12 will complain.  PEV’s AssetX program has a thumbnail generation facility.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==== Step 10 – Asset file check ====

We now need to import the asset files into Trainz Content Manager.  There are several ways of doing this but for the purpose of this tutorial we will just copy the files using Windows copy.
:* Ensure the asset is “Open for Edit” in Content Manager.  Open a window to folder …\Auran\TSxx\UserData\editing\Normal Test. 
:* Open the development folder where the Blender files are located.
:* The following files are to be copied ('''not moved''') from the development folder to the Trainz editing folder. 
::* Config.txt
::* Normal_test.im
::* Rivets_normal.tga
::* Rivets_normal.texture.txt
::* Black.tga  (this was my diffuse colour file – substitute whatever file you used)
::* Black.texture.txt &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The following pictures show my source folder, with files to be copied highlighted, and the destination folder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:7-Source files to be copied.jpg|center|1000px|Source file folder]]

[[File:8-Destination folder after copying.jpg|center|1000px|Trainz editing folder with asset files]]
&lt;br /&gt;
After copying the files, move to Trainz Content Manager, select the Normal Test asset and commit.  If you have errors check you have all the files and that tga files are not compressed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==== Step 11 – Display in Trainz ====

Launch Trainz from Content Manager (Ctrl L), find a suitable test route and session and add the “Normal Test” scenery object to your session.
The lighting affects the display of the normal map texture and seems to work best on horizontal surfaces.  In some lights the rivets are difficult to see.
Below is how the asset looks in the author’s Trainz session (TS12).  You may need to experiment with different colours and settings to get the effect that works best for you.
Since the rivets are rather small, the effect is subtle and, in some lighting conditions, almost invisible. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
[[File:Blender normal mapped cube in Trainz.jpg|center|800px|Blender normal mapped cube in Trainz]]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This final picture shows the normal image in the UV/Image Editor, the textured cube in the 3D Editor and part of the attributes for the normal material in the Properties-&gt;Texture Editor.  Note that the GLSL option is selected in the Shading panel in the 3D Editor Properties panel.   This is only done for taking this picture so both textures are visible on the model.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

==Acknowledgments==
This tutorial was inspired by a number of discussions on the Trainz Content Creation Forum and the author's interest in creating normal maps for use in Trainz.
Paul Hobbs discusses normal mapping in his excellent Blender tutorials&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hobbs|first=Paul|title=Part 2 Mapping and Texturing|url=http://www.44090digitalmodels.co.uk/tutorials/blender2.html|work=A Blender Tutorial - Building a Simple Loco|accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be found on his website.  Those tutorials are written for an earlier version of Blender and the Blender 2.5 interface is rather different.

There are several You Tube videos on normal mapping in Blender but the following are recommended viewing: &lt;br /&gt;

     ETHICS something you beleive in, when you know it's wrong. Ethics is something personnal, only you can be the one to trust in yourself. ompanies want poeple they can trust, and believe to so the right thing. Some people beleive that if you just mind your own busniess and not get involved you are doing the right thing, but you can be involved and still do the right thing. Only you will know the answer to the question. Believe in yourself and trust yourself to do the right thing.  your ethics and how you go about things are what will define you at the end.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
===What is steel?===
Steel is an alloy that consists of iron and carbon. Carbon content added to steel depends on the grade of steel and typically ranges from 0.2 to 2.1 %. Carbon is mostly used for alloying with iron but a number of other alloying elements have also been used such as manganese, chromium, vanadium and tungsten. 

Carbon and other elements function as hardening agents preventing deformations of iron atom crystal lattice. The invention of Bessemer process in the mid 19th century improved steel production methods. Further modifications were made in the process to make it cost effective and produce steel of better quality.

Modern processes make steel with different combinations of metal alloys to produce steel with different properties for various purposes, such as:

*Carbon steel is composed of mainly carbon and iron. It makes up 90 % of steel production.

*High Strength low alloy steel (HSLA) has small additions of other elements such as manganese to increase steel strength.

*Low Alloy steel uses alloys of manganese, chromium, nickel or molybdenum to improve the hardness of thick sections.

*Stainless Steel uses 11 % chromium usually combined with nickel to resist rust formation (corrosion).

===What are steel structures?===
Steel buildings are metal structures made of steel.  These metal structures can be used to build offices, hospitals, homes, schools, warehouse and workshops. These steel buildings have gained popularity worldwide. The use of computer aided design technology has given a new dimension to building designs. The future steel buildings can be assembled easily as most of the steel components are pre-engineered. Nuts and bolts can be fixed in the specified holes and the structure can be made in minimum time with less labor. Personalized commercial and industrial buildings can also be made, as steel is now available in different colors and shapes.

Steel has become the leading choice as construction material due to its numerous advantages over other building materials. The steel functions as a skeleton for the building. It performs all the functions a human skeleton does. Steel helps keep the building standing tall. It provides strength to the structure. In addition, steel provides resistance against harsh climatic conditions and gives a sleek appearance to the structure. Maintenance of the steel structure is easier compared to if concrete is used for the same purpose.

===History of Steel Making===
History of steel making goes back to 4th century BC.  Steel weapons were produced in Iberian Peninsula. Roman military used Noric Steel (high quality steel from Noricum). Chinese of Han Dynasty created carbon intermediate steel by melting wrought iron together with cast iron.

People of East Africa discovered high heat blast furnace which allowed them to forge carbon steel. This technique was duplicated during Industrial Revolution in Europe.

Evidences of carbon steel production in the Subcontinent was found in Sri Lanka. Unique wind furnace blown by monsoon winds was used to produce high carbon steel. Also known as Wootz steel, it is famous for its durability. Trace elements were also used in production of this steel. 

Wootz steel was also produced in India and China. It was a complicated alloy containing Iron as the major component. Steel possessed legendary qualities.

Crucible steel was produced in Merv by slow heating and cooling of pure iron and carbon (typically charcoal) in the 9th -10th century.

===History of Steel Buildings===
Steel buildings are very popular choice for commercial and residential purposes. They can be used as storage units for business or temporary shelters. The early 20th century saw a great rise in demand of steel buildings. After World War II, their use became more prevalent. Steel frame shelters were built for the army to provide housing during the World War. After the war, army shelters were used as living accommodation. Easy availability of steel then allowed more constructions of steel buildings. The use of steel buildings became more diverse as the people came to know about the strength and durability of steel. 

Prefabricated steel buildings came in to use in 1960. These metal buildings had components premade including roof, floor, frame, walls and bracing. The parts just needed to be put together to make a building stand. This allowed to create buildings in various designs and made construction easier. The first computer aided design steel building was seen in 1960’s. This allowed steel buildings to have more designs, features, shapes and sizes.

A wide varieties of steel buildings are available now including Arch Steel Buildings, Clear span Buildings and Straight walled buildings. The Arch Steel buildings are used as storage units for agricultural business. They are structurally very strong and durable. The straight walled buildings are less sturdy compared to Arch steel buildings but have more usable space inside. These clear span buildings use big overhead beams in place of inside support columns.  It offers wide open interior spaces to be used for commercial and industrial buildings. It is a great choice for warehouses, factories and storage space.  As beams are not included in the structure, you can easily rearrange floor plans according to your needs. The clear span buildings are ideal for use as aircraft storage space and maintenance hangers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Steel in Construction Industry==
Using steel as construction material is not only limited to industrial buildings or temporary shelters. Steel has established itself as one of the most versatile construction materials available for use. It has become a popular choice due to its durability, strength and resilience.

Steel is also called as a green product. Concrete and wood cannot be reused, steel can be recycled thus is more cost effective.

===Advantages of Using Steel===
Steel buildings can be produced and engineered faster than conventional buildings. Pre-engineered steel has cut down the cost and labor. Construction does not require long times. The material can be shipped to the location and joined together to make a strong structure. 

Steel buildings are able to withstand the natural disasters. Earthquakes, cyclones, hurricanes, sudden climatic changes can strike anytime. Use of concrete can cause a number of causalities.  Also damages caused to the concrete structure need a lot of money to be repaired. Steel is cost effective and resilient.In addition, Termites, rodents and insects cannot house in steel. This will reduce the sufferings of many people who spend loads of money on fumigations.

Since steel is lighter but has more tensile strength, it can be used with other construction materials if needed. These steel structures have more flexibility as compared to other building materials. Components can be shifted from one place to the other without difficulties. You can even add space by extending the structure.

===Grades of Steel===
Classification of steel in different grades is based on their chemical composition and physical properties. It has been developed by many standard organizations. 

*Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) steel grades.
*British Standards.
*International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
*ASTM International
*Japanese steel grades JIS standard
*Germany steel grades DIN standard
*China steel grades GB standard

===Structural Steel===
Structural steel is made from high strength low-alloy (HSLA) steel. HSLA steels are different from other steels in the way that they are made according to specific mechanical properties not chemical composition. This type of steel is used to produce shapes, structural bars and plates which are used for building and bridge construction. Structural steel has high strength and is flexible.
 
Typical carbon content of HSLA steel is 0.05-0.25%. Carbon is included for steel to retain its weld ability.  Other alloy elements include up to 2 % Manganese and small quantities of copper, nickel, calcium, chromium, vanadium and titanium. These elements are added to strengthen steel and increase resistance to corrosion. Structural steel is formed using heat analysis.

Structural steel shape, composition, size, strength and storage are regulated in most industrialized countries. Steels used for building construction in the US are identified and specified by ASTM International.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Properties of Structural Steel==

Following properties of structural steel are considered before using them for a construction.  These properties are useful for determining the quality of steel. High quality steel is used so that dependable and long lasting construction is possible. The most important components include the following:

: '''1. Density'''

: Density of a material is defined as mass per unit volume. Structural steel has density of 7.75 to 8.1 g/cm3.

: '''2. Elastic Modulus'''

: Elastic modulus or modulus of elasticity is the measurement of tendency of an object to be deformed when force or stress is applied to it. Typical values for structural steel range from 190-210 gigapascals.

: '''3. Poisson's Ratio'''

: It is the ratio between contraction and elongation of the material. Lower the value, lesser the object will shrink in thickness when stretched. Acceptable values for structural steel are 0.27 to 0.3.

: '''4. Tensile Strength'''

: Tensile strength of an object is the determination of limit up to which an object can be stretched without breaking. Fracture point is the point at which an object breaks after application of stress. Structural steel has high tensile strength so is preferred over other materials for construction. 

: '''5. Yield Strength'''

: Yield strength or yield point is the stress at which an object deforms permanently. It cannot return to its original shape when stress is removed. Structural steel made of carbon has yield strengths of 187 to 758 megapascals. Structural steel made of alloys has values from 366 to 1793 megapascals.

: '''6. Melting Point'''

: There is no defined value for melting point due to the wide variations in types of structural steel. Melting point is the temperature at which object starts to melt when heated.

: '''7. Specific Heat'''

: Specific heat or heat capacity is the amount of heat which needs to be applied to the object to raise its temperature by a given amount. A higher value of specific heat denotes greater insulation ability of the object. Values are measured in Joules per Kilogram Kelvin. Structural steel made of carbon has values from 450 to 2081 and that made from alloys has values ranging from 452 to 1499.

: '''8. Hardness'''

: Hardness is the resistance of an object to shape change when force is applied. There are 3 types of hardness measurements. Scratch, indentation and rebound. Structural steel made by using alloys has hardness value between 149-627 Kg. Structural steels made of carbon has value of 86 to 388 Kg.

==Components of Steel==
Modern steel buildings are made of many individual components that have evolved over time. With the benefit of CAD manufacturers are able to produce more variations in dimensions and format of steel buildings.  The building construction is done using different steel shapes and pieces. In most of the developed countries, standard approved shapes are available. Smaller steel buildings are prefabricated, so they are simple to assemble. The larger steel buildings require skilled workers so that safe assembly of the structure is ensured.

There are five main components of structural steel, including tension members, compression members, bending members, combined force members and their connections.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Component !! Description
|-
| Tension Members || Tension members can be found as web and chord in trusses and open web steel joints. They carry tensile and pulling forces preventing force to be applied on the other members used in construction.
|-
| Compression Members || Columns, Struts or posts make up the compression members. They are the vertical members in trusses and joists that are in compression.
|-
| Bending Members || Beams, joists, girders, spandrels, lintels are known as bending members. Each member has its own application but typically bending members carry moments and shear forces.
|-
| Combined Force Members || Combined force members are also known as beam-columns and are subjected to bending compression.  Connecting members bring the entire building together.
|-
| Connections || Steel beam forms basic skeleton of the building and provides great support and strength. These beams usually hold the floor or the roof.  I beams are widely used and come in different sizes. I beam can be used both as a beam and a column. The girder or I beam is used in construction of nearly all metal buildings. It gives strength in all directions. Every structural component of a steel building can be made by varying sizes of I beam. Similarly, Reinforced Bars is a type of steel rod which is used to create reinforced concrete. Steel rods are inserted into concrete to add strength and give flexibility to concrete. These bars are important in buildings made of concrete or which have substantial amounts of concrete used in construction. Steel joists are used to support floors or ceilings. These are laid in rows across girders. They are attached using joist hangers.

      <comment>/* Building Design */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Development of Steel Buildings==
===Construction Basics===
Before proceeding with the building design, figure out the exact purpose of construction. Most of the time greater attention is paid to the final look of the building, not the purpose for which it has to be built. It is important to consider how big and tall a structure needs to stand. The time for which building needs to be used is also an important factor. 

If the building needs to be used for long periods, steel is a good choice. It will give greater strength and durability. Steel does not bend, break or twist with increasing load. Changes can be made very easily to the steel structure. 

Pre-engineered steel used for construction these days has pre defined points at which bolts need to be fixed.  

The most impressive feature of steel is that it is recyclable and is very environmentally friendly.

Most steel buildings used for offices or even apartments are located on busy streets of the city. It becomes more important to consider the safety of the residents and people waking around these structures. Structural flaws need to be avoided at all costs. 

===Building Design===
The design of a modern building involves a team of experts from different disciplines. The team needs to communicate clearly to avoid any undesired outcome at the end of the procedure. The concept of the final design of the building starts with a drawing. Here the architecture comes into action. Designers (architects) start making new drawings and sketches. A rough design is made initially. Any problems in the design need to be corrected in the early stages. With support from the structural engineer, the complex procedure of drawing a building structure can become easier.  

There are two basic parts of a building design. First is the aesthetic and second is practical. The physical and visual appearance of the building needs to be attractive. It will influence the perception people have of the building. The practical aspect of the building design is mainly concerned with the space allotment for different activities. It includes entry and exit of people, lighting, acoustics, legal matters and building codes.

Computer Aided Design (CAD) is widely used computer software to create technical drawings. There is no need to make the drawing on paper. A 3D model of the building can be made using CAD. Visuals can be added to the model. Different colors and textures can also be applied. Most appropriate settings can then be finalized. 

After the architecture is decided, it is important to work out the design of the framework. Beams, columns, bracing are decided by engineering calculations.  It is the job of the structural engineer to give a shape to the architect’s idea.

===Steel Frame===
A steel frame refers to the building technique with a steel skeleton. Vertical steel columns and horizontal I beams are constructed in a rectangular grid. This grid frame supports the attached walls, floors and roof of the building. The development of the steel frame technique has made the construction of sky scrapers possible.

The cross section of steel columns has a shape similar to the letter H. the two flanges of the column are thicker and wider as compared to the flanges on a beam. This makes it better to withstand compression stress on the building structure. Square or round steel tubules can be also used. They are often filled with concrete. Steel beams are connected to the columns with fasteners and bolts. The steel web in I beam is wider than column web to resist higher bending stress and moments that occur in beams.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Showing an image file=
==Introduction==
OpenClinica allows us to upload a file to the system. This file is only accessible through a link, it is not shown on the page. In this how-to we will see how we can show image files automatically.

==Where to store the uploaded files==
In datainfo.properties there is an attribute called 'attached_file_location'. This specifies where the uploaded files will be stored on the server. If we leave this item blank the default location will be used: /usr/local/tomcat/&lt;study_name&gt;.data/. 

===Challenge with default upload location===
The default upload location is not in the root of the OpenClinica web application. Tomcat can therefore not access it, when we use a &lt;img&gt; tag.
There are two ways around this.
# Change the default location
# Use a reverse proxy to serve images

====Change the default location====
When we want to store files in a place that is visible to Tomcat we change the line in datainfo.properties to:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
attached_file_location=/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/&lt;study_name&gt;/attached_files/
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Don't forget to change the &lt;study_name&gt; placeholder into something meaningful for your system.
====Use a reverse proxy to serve images====
Use [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/UsingAReverseProxy]] to install Nginx as a reverse proxy.  
Add this line to the https server configuration of Nginx
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
location ~ ^/studies/attached_files/(.*)$ {
    #don't forget to change &lt;study_name&gt;
    alias /usr/local/tomcat/&lt;study_name&gt;.data/attached_files/$1;
}	
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Now images will be served directly by Nginx. If you use a lot of images, this is the preferred configuration.

==Code to add to the Excel CRF definition==
Read [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/StylingWithJQuery]] for a better understanding of the code below.
Put the code in LEFT_ITEM_TEXT.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;jquery&quot;&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  jQuery(document).ready(function($) { 
    function showPicture(pIDSelector,pCSSMapInput) {     	
        // find the link to the picture
        var vPath = location.pathname; 
        // are we only viewing the data?
        if (vPath.search('ViewSectionDataEntry') &gt; 0) {
            // yes, we are   
	    var picLink = $(pIDSelector).parent().next().find('a').attr('href');
        } else {
            // no, we are editing
            var picLink = $(pIDSelector).parent().parent().find('div').find('a').attr('href');
        }
        // accept only png and jpg files
        if (picLink.indexOf(&quot;.png&quot;) &gt; 0 || picLink.indexOf(&quot;.jpg&quot;) &gt; 0) {
            var vCSS = &quot;&quot;
	    for (css in pCSSMapInput) {
	      vCSS = vCSS + css + &quot;:&quot; + pCSSMapInput[css] + &quot;;&quot;; 
	    }
            //choose one of vUploadLocation, depending on your configuration (delete the other)
            // change &lt;study_name&gt; to a valid name for your installation
	    var vUploadLocation = '&lt;study_name&gt;.data'; 
	    var vUploadLocation = '&lt;study_name&gt;';
	    
            var picSrc = picLink.substr(picLink.search('attached_files'));
            $(pIDSelector).parent().parent().before('&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;' +  vCSS + ' &quot; alt=&quot;pic&quot; src=&quot;/' + vUploadLocation + '/' + picSrc + '&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;');
        }

Recent research suggests that one key element in predicting societal instability is a &quot;democracy gap.&quot;  In countries where the populace have expectations for higher levels of political freedoms than they actually have, there are greater odds of revolutions and riots, like those that began in the [[w:Arab_Spring|Arab Spring]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheafer2013&quot;&gt;Sheafer, Tamir, and Shaul Shenhav. 2013. “Political Culture Congruence and Political Stability Revisiting the Congruence Hypothesis with Prospect Theory.” Journal of Conflict Resolution 57(2):232–57.&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests a growing awareness of human rights and political freedoms around the world, including in authoritarian and dictatorial countries.

== [[Wikibooks:Desired bots]] ==

This page lists many desired bot functions that would be useful for Wikibooks and have actual effects on the activities here.  Only double redirect fixing has been handled locally. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 03:29, 7 October 2011 (UTC)
: These look interesting, I will begin working on them after I finish a few things. [[User:Hethrir|Hethrir]] ([[User talk:Hethrir|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hethrir|contribs]]) 19:33, 7 October 2011 (UTC)


== Possible improvement ==
Consider the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Transwiki:Type_conversion&amp;curid=48799&amp;diff=2216501&amp;oldid=2216211 edit] concerning the wikification of subtype. It would be interesting to have the bot check the first use of a wikified word on the page text it is working on and move the wikification to the first appearance of the word. A second improvement would be to remove duplicated wikifications on the same heading if the page is large or on the hole page if its size is small. Since keeping extra wikilinks may be relevant when the page is split.

This would be extremely interesting as the bot revisits pages over times.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:38, 23 November 2011 (UTC)
:I'm not entirely sure I know what you mean, you want it to look for the first occurrence of a wikilink, then it should only modify that? [[User:Hethrir|Hethrir]] ([[User talk:Hethrir|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hethrir|contribs]]) 07:23, 23 November 2011 (UTC)

::No, it would check the first occurrence on the text of the word that is wikified and move the wikification there (and remove duplicated wikifications of the word as stated above).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 15:36, 23 November 2011 (UTC)

== Bot flag ==
I do not understand the reasons behind the resistance to grant the bot the flag, since much of what people are opposing has been addressed, and it would be extremely easy to remove the flag if any claim of damage was made. My advice is that you remove your request (close the discussion on that basis), and put the burden of a future discussion in anyone that sees the bot actions as detrimental to RC patrol. The time and effort on the discussion to inform participants has gone beyond the reasonable and since the objections outnumber the support I do not see any benefit (to you or the bot) in proceeding.&lt;br&gt;
You have done your due diligence if anyone feels troubled by the notifications on the RC log they should take initiative and start their own process to get the flag for the bot. You can however attempt to avoid flooding the log but do not make that a constrain to your productivity.&lt;br&gt;
I would also point out that if you need to test the bot (or have extra time to run it) to look into the transwiki namespace and find orphaned imports that do not have a valid (by the requester or by an active admin) request for dewikification and run the wikification function on them (and other non objectionable functions you feel reasonable). Even if some of the work may not result in someone using the content the activity on those pages may prompt adoptions or administrative deletions.&lt;br&gt;
You could also place a notice on the transwiki related pages on your bot availability for reactivating the wikilinks of imports.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:12, 24 November 2011 (UTC)
:That seems wise at this point, perhaps in the future if someone requests a large amount of work I will get it, I will also leave a link on the transwiki page, per your advise. The transwiki pages seem like a good testing grounds, although I'm not sure if everyone would want to link back to wikipedia? or is this common? [[User:Hethrir|Hethrir]] ([[User talk:Hethrir|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hethrir|contribs]]) 04:07, 24 November 2011 (UTC)
::The links are part of the imported content, logic dictates that if they could the links would continue to function. Some people do not like the excessive linking (hence my previous idea for improvement) or had any other possibility to mass resolve the red links and so used the (previously) only available tool to perform dewikification. The Wikilinks are in themselves useful content and even important for inter-project coordination and promotion. Aside for esthetically reasons, that can also be done even after you rewikify them, I do not see a particular motive to continue the default practice of removing them. In any case you can have the freedom to use the bot on orphaned traswikied pages, even if the usefulness may be a tentative point, as I stated above, the edit activity will bring more visibility to those pages, even more since the bot will be listed on the RC log. Orphaned transwikis are pages that remained non-utilized for more than lets say 4 months, if no one acted on them for that long chances are they will remain unused until they are deleted, heck you can even find something that you can even merge yourself with a valid book.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 05:17, 24 November 2011 (UTC)

== [[Transwiki:Nonverbal communication]] ==
The same as all ways :), if you have the the extra time do a new pass on [[Hypnosis]] especially in regards to the unfolding of [[w:Contraction (grammar)|contractions]].  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:53, 28 November 2011 (UTC)
:After another fix (errors seem to randomly pop-up), both are finished. [[User:Hethrir|Hethrir]] ([[User talk:Hethrir|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hethrir|contribs]]) 01:23, 30 November 2011 (UTC)

:Check you loop conditions and recursion, how the the accumulator variables change. One error &quot;[[ethology|ethologist]] [[Iraneus Eibl-Eibesfeldt]]&quot; is when wikilinks are consecutive, resulting in &quot;[[ethology|ethologist]] Iraneus Eibl-Eibesfeldt]]&quot;.
:The parser also seems to continue to process the already fixed links (like &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:anything|something]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;). Does it check for the target's existence ? If not the logics would be to seek the next ]] with a notion noticing a new [[ or new lines characters.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:38, 30 November 2011 (UTC)
::Interesting, fixing now. It does check the target's existence, although it doesn't know what &quot;w:&quot; means, so I'll fix that too. [[User:Hethrir|Hethrir]] ([[User talk:Hethrir|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hethrir|contribs]]) 17:16, 1 December 2011 (UTC)

== [[Transwiki:Drowning]] and [[Transwiki:Campfire]] ==
Keeping the bot feed :) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:08, 30 November 2011 (UTC)
: [[Do-It-Yourself/Campfire]] It appears as if someone else has transwiki'd it, although this is now rewikified. [[Transwiki:Campfire]] rewikified  [[User:Hethrir|Hethrir]] ([[User talk:Hethrir|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hethrir|contribs]]) 23:51, 2 December 2011 (UTC)
:: Thanks. I was going to use it in several works with a focus on the [[When It Hits the Fan]] (the [[Do-It-Yourself/Campfire]] also seems a bit of a mishmash but I have a lot of work pending so I will not start a move to merge parts of that work with others) How to build a sword would also be fine in When It Hits the Fan in the weapons section for instance, the snap look I gave to the Do-It-Yourself seems to indicate that it is something like the CookBook but with Do It Yourself Guides. I may merge part of the rewikified article with the copy there but for now will not take any further action.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:17, 3 December 2011 (UTC)

== [[LGBT Young Adult Literature/Annie on My Mind]] ==

Would your bot be able to rewikify [[LGBT Young Adult Literature/Annie on My Mind]], please? --[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thereen|contribs]]) 09:04, 25 December 2011 (UTC)

And also [[Ukrainian/Diaspora]]?--[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thereen|contribs]]) 09:06, 25 December 2011 (UTC)
:This is finished, my bot seems to be having trouble with links in image descriptions. Also, sorry for the long wait, I had tons to do, on top of the bot needing re-design in an area, should you need future rewifying it should take nowhere near as long. Unfortunately the first rewikify request clashes with my world-view.
::And so you refused it? I suppose that's your prerogative. Thanks for doing the Diaspora request. --[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thereen|contribs]]) 23:30, 15 January 2012 (UTC)

:Unfortunatley, I lost my source while transfering OSs, so I am currently re-writing it, so there may be a minor delay. But it shouldn't be too long, as I am only re-creating it. [[User:Hethrir|Hethrir]] ([[User talk:Hethrir|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hethrir|contribs]]) 16:57, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

::: Actually, I'm currently using github to store all my source code, although I had forgotten to update it before I transferred.

== Request for rewikification of [[Transwiki:Military order]] ==
A new one. The same as always, note that for instance links like &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Knights Templar#something|something]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; are not being properly handled (turned into &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Knights Templar#something|something]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 04:48, 10 April 2012 (UTC)

'''Flan pâtissier nature''' is a traditional preparation you can easily find in French bakeries and patisseries. This recipe is a base for eventual variations which would add fruit or other ingredients. 


[[Image:Flan pâtissier.jpg|thumb|right|A slice of flan pâtissier]]

== Ingredients for 6-8 people ==

* 3 whole [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]
* 500 ml of whole [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 200 g of [[Cookbook:Puff Pastry|puff pastry]]
* 150 g of granulated [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] or 10 tablespoons of fruit sugar
* 80 g or 8 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornflour]]
* 1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] flavour extract

== Procedure==

# Preheat oven to 200°C. If using frozen puff pastry take it out from the freezer.
# Heat the milk in a saucepan.
# In a bowl, mix the sugar and the cornflour, beat in the whole eggs. Pour in little by little the milk to this mixture and whisk well, add the vanilla flavour and pour the mixture into the pan of hot milk.
# Cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly, and take off the heat before it gets to boiling point.
# Roll out the puff pastry into a metal pie pan previously buttered. Pour over the milk preparation.
# Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden on the top. Cool in refrigerator.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You would like a command line function that will reindex a collection.

== Method ==
We will use an Apache Ant task that will call an XQuery script that will run the reindex XQuery function.

== Sample Ant Target ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;target name=&quot;reindex-faqs&quot;&gt;
    &lt;property name=&quot;server-uri&quot; value=&quot;xmldb:exist://localhost:8080/xmlrpc&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;property name=&quot;collection&quot; value=&quot;/db/dan/apps/faqs/data&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;echo message=&quot;Reindexing collection ${collection}&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;echo message=&quot;on server-uri = ${server-uri}&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xdb:xquery uri=&quot;${server-uri}/db&quot;  
         user=&quot;admin&quot; password=&quot;myadminpw&quot;
         outputproperty=&quot;result&quot;&gt;
            xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
            
            let $start-time := util:system-time()
            let $reindex := xmldb:reindex('/db/dan/apps/faqs/data')
            let $end-time := util:system-time()
            let $runtimems := (($end-time - $start-time) div xs:dayTimeDuration('PT1S'))  * 1000 
            return $runtimems
     &lt;/xdb:xquery&gt;
     &lt;echo message=&quot;Reindex performed in = ${result} milliseconds.&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Running your Ant Target ==

To run the command just use the ant command

   '''$ant reindex-faqs'''

   Buildfile: build.xml
   reindex-faqs:
     [echo] Reindexing collection /db/dan/apps/faqs/data
     [echo] test server = xmldb:exist://localhost/xmlrpc
   [xdb:xquery] Database driver registered.
   [xdb:xquery] Found 1 results
   [echo] Reindex performed in = 203 milliseconds.
   BUILD SUCCESSFUL
   Total time: 1 second

== Discussion ==
This should work both under Windows and UNIX systems.

This template is used to produce rounded corners for tables. Just embed it in any &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div&gt;, &lt;table&gt;: etc.&lt;/nowiki&gt; element.

==== Example ====

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #ffff66; {{round corners}} padding: 0.5em 1em;&quot;&gt;Text text text&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
:''which produces:''
&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #ffff66; {{round corners}} padding: 0.5em 1em;&quot;&gt;Text text text&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">My interests are riding motorcycles, steam trains, software development and railway simulators.  I'm a retiree, ex Navy, ex software engineer and numerous other jobs!  My particular interest is in the Trainz railway simulator and confess I get more out of developing routes, sessions and assets than I do actually running them.

As a child in the UK, I used to ride a steam train to school.  Part of that railway still exists as a tourist attraction.  For a couple of years prior to emigrating to Australia I was an enthusiastic Ian Allen trainspotter and still retain books from that time.

My current ride is a BMW GT1300SE although I have been a Honda, Yamaha and Harley rider in the past.  Of all my bikes I miss my Harley the most.

My software development skills have waned since my retirement but occasionally I feel the need to write something.  My latest project is a Sudoku puzzle solver using the GPL GNAT (Ada) compiler and GTKADA toolsets.

My meagre contributions to WiKiBooks are likely to be &quot;how to&quot; guides so that I can return the help I have obtained from many others.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;Spearman Rank- Correlation coefficient&lt;/big&gt;'''

Spearman developed a method of measuring rank correlation known as spearman rank correlation coefficient. It is generally denoted by r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. There are three cases while calculating Spearman rank correlation coefficient:

''Case i''     When ranks are given

''Case ii''    When ranks are not given

''Case iii''   Repeated ranks

The formula for calculating Spearman rank correlation coefficient is same for case i and ii. The formula is,

          
                      &lt;math&gt;r_s = 1-\frac {6\sum \!\,d^2}
{n(n^2 - 1)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where,

n = The number of items or individuals being ranked

d = &lt;math&gt;R_1 - R_2
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; = The rank of items with respect to first variable

&lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; = The rank of items with respect to second variable

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to manage a queue of items and be able to move items around the queue.  Sample operations are move up, move down and move to top.

== Screen Image ==

The up arrow will move the selected row up one item.  The down arrow will move the selected item down one item.  The triangle will move the selected item to the top of the queue.

[[File:Xforms-queue-manager.png|Screen Image of Queue Manager|center]]

     &lt;/xf:trigger&gt;  
   &lt;/div&gt;  
&lt;/xf:repeat&gt;  
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==

The key to this example is to understand how the insert and delete operations are used with different attributes.

The trigger that moves an item up will need to store its current location in a temporary item.

Note that the current version applies to the highlighted row, not the row that you select the button on.

== [[Delta3D]] ==

Looks like you were the last person to &quot;touch&quot; the wikibooks Delta3D topic. I have been &quot;updating&quot; the wikipedia article for Delta3D but am limited due to style and usage guidelines for content there and would like to extend the information available by adding to and revising the wikibooks information.

Thought I'd ask first rather than just jumping in and making changes. Are there any concerns or restrictions I should be aware of before diving in and modifying the &quot;book&quot;?

[[User:Jambay|Jambay]] ([[User talk:Jambay|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jambay|contribs]]) 22:27, 17 July 2011 (UTC)
:I just performed some maintenance tasks on the book and have no real involvement.  You're free to do what you like with it as it could really use some updating. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:06, 18 July 2011 (UTC)

Thank you for the quick reply and update to my discussion page. Here's hoping it (my editing) goes well and is received well.

[[User:Jambay|Jambay]] ([[User talk:Jambay|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jambay|contribs]]) 09:03, 18 July 2011 (UTC)

At first I will just &quot;add&quot;, in a monolithic style/format and then try to organize; not really sure what to do with page2 and page3 yet. I already realize I have content in the &quot;wrong section&quot; and there aren't that many so some re-work will be necessary to get the flow right and polish the content. Expect to add content periodically just to see how the community reacts to the changes.

== Needs fixin' ==

Blackberry Blossum is both Bluegrass and Old Time but I am working on tunebook companion guides for both genres. For ease of printing they probably both need to have separate pages but I could not create a unique page for Fiddler's Companion because of the ol' WP blacklist issue. Perhaps you can fix that?[[ Fiddlers Companion Volume III Bluegrass/Blackberry Blossom (tune)]] is the text which I wish to replicate. Many complex references which took a couple  few hours or so to compile into the article. It would be nice to keep the references and have individual pages for each book, if you get time perhaps you can take a look?[[User:Geofferybard|&amp;#91;&amp;#91;User:Geof Bard गीता&amp;#93;&amp;#93;]] ([[User talk:Geofferybard|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Geofferybard|contribs]]) 01:59, 22 July 2011 (UTC)
:I'm really not sure what you're asking here. You can use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Page Name/Subpage Name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to transclude a page onto another if a page needs to be a member of two books. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 03:25, 22 July 2011 (UTC)
::OK I will try that. But I am not sure that when I get to creating printable versions if the issue will reassert itself. But I don't think that people necessarily want to print a lot of references for that particular book.  I was asking for the blacklist to not block saving the edits. It seems that the blacklist is overly inclusive. It might be blogspot which is causing the problem. But edits will not save, I get an error message that says it is necessary to remove the blacklisted reference.[[User:Geofferybard|&amp;#91;&amp;#91;User:Geof Bard गीता&amp;#93;&amp;#93;]] ([[User talk:Geofferybard|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Geofferybard|contribs]]) 23:30, 22 July 2011 (UTC)

===Detail: The error message===
Spam protection filter

Your edit was not saved because it contains a new external link to a site registered on Wikibooks' blacklist.

    To save your changes now, you must go back and remove the blocked link (shown below), and then save.

    If you feel the link is needed, you can:

        Request that the entire website be allowed, that is, removed from the local or global spam blacklists (check both lists to see which one is affecting you).

        Request that just the specific page be allowed, without unblocking the whole website, by asking on the spam whitelist talk page. 

Blacklisting indicates past problems with the link, so any requests should clearly demonstrate how inclusion would benefit Wikibooks.

===Detail: How the error message is generated===

===What I wish to accomplish===

I would like to be able to create a printable HTML version of [[Bards_Old_Time_Fiddle_Tunebook_Supplement|this]] book: 
which includes the references. But [[Bards Old Time Fiddle Tunebook Supplement/Blackberry Blossom|the page in question]] resists re-creation at [[Bards Bluegrass Fiddle Tunebook Supplement/Blackberry Blossom|this]] book. The tune is used in both genres, and since I wrote the entire article there is no need to worry about edit histories. So what I would like would be for the blacklist to be eased up a bit, if possible. Alternatively, maybe there is a way to overide the block. If worse comes to worse, maybe there can be some kind of macro or bot that will isolate the blacklisted link, which is somewhat of a mystery.
:It's reference #14. Blogspot is not a reference for facts and using it as a source is as bad as using Wikipedia as a citation in one's doctorate thesis.  If you really can't live without it, it can be overridden at [[MediaWiki:Spam-whitelist]], but I strongly suggest you consider the reliability of your sources. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:08, 23 July 2011 (UTC)
::That's good advice but in some cases the blogger is reputable and known to the musician community; in others it is to corroborate rather than to establish something anecdotal&gt; But I will check things over. In many instances if writing about fiddle music I may want to write something I know to be true and need to corroborate, and there are no academic papers on it, so a blogger fits.

===Summary and status report===

I am going offline until at least tommorow. I started the Print Version [[Bards Old Time Fiddle Tunebook Supplement/Print Version 1|here]] and got through the first couple of songs, Angeline the Baker and Arkansas Traverler. When I got to Blackberry Blossom, I got stuck...if you try to paste the copy from the main book into the printable version, everything is fine until you put in the references tag in curly brackets, and then you are blocked from saving. Some readers will definitely prefer having the footnotes, so maybe this can be remedied without too much trouble. If not, I can work around it. Thanks for your time and attention, I am quite pleased with this little book and look forward to upgrading it.

:You shouldn't be copying and pasting into a print version.  It won't be kept up to date with changes on the original pages themselves.  You need to use the method I showed for transcluding a page onto another.  This will also save you loads of time and you won't have to manually update the print version.  Harness the power of the wiki.  You can then use {{tag|noinclude}} tags around the references section on the page to keep them from showing up in the print version, if desired.

:Note that there is a limit to the number of transclusions. It may be only possible to provide a by chapter/section print version. I also remember seeing a template/hack that permits to have all references in a print version aggregated into a single page, I think this is the page [[Annotations of The Complete Peanuts/References]] (don't know if it works).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 14:13, 23 July 2011 (UTC)
::I appreciate the suggestion, but probably it's not a matter of the quantity of references, it seems the problem is that there are certain domains listed on the WikiBooks server which are blocked because they are suspected of obtrusive commercial activity (spamm). However, the page in question is not blocked at either Wikipedia nor at Wikiversity, where I tested, and so it is probable that WB has more sites blacklisted than WP or WV.But thanks for the suggestion.

::RE: references  I thought that a curly bracket references tag at the end of the print version is all that would be needed. Perhaps if the book is kept short enough the threshold &quot;transclusions&quot; limit won't be reached? Actually I was thinking of a references-free &quot;Economy Print&quot; version which had a Bibliography at the end, anyway, because what with global warming [?] and all, I think we are supposed to be thrifty with paper. But it is important in the long run that WB books be able to go to print fully references. Cheers.

:::Well for changes to the list you should continue to talk with Adrignola (he made some changes recently [[MediaWiki:Spam-blacklist]] or you can make a post on the administrative requests/discussion area), you can probably circumvent the block by using for instance the Wayback Machine http://www.archive.org (my favorite even if the resource is up and usable) or some working redirector (use only if you must).
:::Transclusions limit doesn't have to do with size but number of pages transcluded. I never use the reference stile on Wikibooks, I chose to add the a wikilink to wikipedia's relevant article or a direct (or using the Wayback Machine) to the relevant resource. My feeling is that it is easier to maintain, better for readers and more format portable (it would be marvelous if Wikimedia could support some sort of page formating scheme, even a special markup for the generation of collections PDFs would be great).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 17:36, 23 July 2011 (UTC)

:This book doesn't cover any of those in a dedicated matter and listing them in those subjects is disingenuous.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the biggest problems of inferring a model is the zero frequency problem.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.arturocampos.com/ac_finite_context_modeling.html Zero frequency problem and escape codes]
by Arturo San Emeterio Campos. 1999.
&lt;/ref&gt;

While decompressing a file, an '''adaptive Huffman decoder''' keeps changing its estimate of which letters are likely and which are unlikely according to the letters seen so far in the plaintext. Being the simplest approach, the prediction of future letter frequencies based in the counting of how often each letter has already occurred. The decoder will then decode the next letter using its current table of codewords, which assigns a short codeword to each letter that it predicts is highly likely, and a long codeword to each letter that it predicts is possible but unlikely.

For example, say a text file begins with an extended quotation from &quot;Gadsby&quot; (1939). The simplest approach -- the frequency so far of 'e' is zero, so I'm going to assume that it will continue to be zero -- will not work.

If a Huffman decoder ever gets it in its head that some byte has zero frequency, it is not possible to convince that decoder to emit that byte -- not now, not ever. That byte is no longer part of its dictionary. And so it will not be possible for the decoder to correctly emit plaintext that eventually does use the letter 'e'.

So we must give the Huffman decoder some non-zero estimate of the future frequency of 'e', if we are to have any hope of correctly decoding plaintext that begins with a quotation from &quot;Gadsby&quot;, then later includes the letter 'e'. Even an inaccurate estimate -- as long as it's not exactly zero -- allows the decoder to correctly emit plaintext without error. An accurate estimate will produce a shorter compressed file than an inaccurate estimate. Alas, it is not at all obvious how to accurately estimate the frequency of something that has never occurred yet.

{{NOTE|'''Static Huffman decompressors''' never have this problem -- they can, and often are, told that some byte or another has zero frequency, and everything works out correctly.}}

Context-mixing adaptive decompressors have a similar problem.
To get good compression, the decompressor needs to accurately predict the probability that the next bit is a 1, P(x).
After decompressing enough text, the decompressor can see that event A has occurred Ax times, and the next bit was a one in A1 of those times. So in the absence of other information, when A occurs again, it estimates that the next bit is a one with probability P(x|A) = A1/Ax.
If both A and B have occurred simultaneously many times ABx before (and the next bit was a 1 in AB1 of those cases), then when A and B occur simultaneously again, our best estimate of P(x|A,B) -- our estimate that the next bit is a one -- is AB1/ABx, completely ignoring A1 and Ax and B1 and Bx.

However, the first time A and B occur simultaneously, we can't do that -- we can't calculate 0/0.
All we can do is guess that P(x|A,B) is either the same as P(x|A), or the same as P(x|B), or somehow combine the predictions, possibly using a heuristic such as the Lincoln index that takes into account how many times each event occurred.
Given the event counts A1 and Ax and B1 and Bx, what is a good estimate of P(x|A,B)?
Alas,

&quot;Probability theory doesn't help us, even if we assume A and B are independent.&quot;

== Incubator ==
Discussion of the scope, chapter layout, and general style of the text are welcome here.
Right now is a very formative period in the creation of this text, any constructive input is welcome.

'''I propose the fallowing chapter format.'''
Each chapter should the start out with an introduction that gives an overview of the topic lending it context by highlighting it applications, and current related research.
After the introduction a list of skills needed to use the chapter as well as links to refresher material. 
This is especially important because many students do not have a background that encompasses both engineering and the life sciences fully.
Also many scientists and engineers may have forgotten a lot if they have been out of school for a long period of time.
Each chapter should be broken up into sub-chapters that focus in on just a few related concepts, or a specific technique.
Sub-chapters should include concept checks, worked examples, application exorcises where appropriate.
Each chapter should end with a chapter review that summarizes the chapter concepts, formulas, and methods.
The chapter summary should be fallowed be a series of exercises and one or more labs or projects that explores the material covered in the chapter.
'''Any thoughts or comments on this format are greatly appreciated.'''[[User:BrandonHoward|BrandonHoward]] ([[User talk:BrandonHoward|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BrandonHoward|contribs]]) 22:24, 28 July 2011 (UTC)

Over the next fer days I will try to implement the above proposed style in [[Biomedical Engineering: theory and practice/Artificial Tissues &amp; Organs]]chapter. 
In doing this I hope to create a test-bed chapter where we can hammer out the style and tone that will eventually be used in the book as a whole.[[User:BrandonHoward|BrandonHoward]] ([[User talk:BrandonHoward|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BrandonHoward|contribs]]) 22:48, 28 July 2011 (UTC)</text>

I note your recent work on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]], and have to ask: given that he ended up going out with Cho, who is a year older than Harry, it is a safe guess that Michael Corner is in Harry's year, but is this actually mentioned anywhere in the books? I had somehow thought he was in Ginny's year... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:43, 28 July 2011 (UTC)</text>

===Rigid Body Mechanics===
'''Rigid body''' defined as a body on which the distance between any two given points remains constant in time regardless of external forces&lt;ref name=&quot;rigidbody&quot;&gt;http://makox.com/mechanical-engineering/what-is-a-rigid-body/&lt;/ref&gt;.  Or it is the body which does not deform under the influence of forces&lt;ref name=&quot;rigidbody&quot; /&gt;.Forces acting of rigid bodies can be also separated in two groups: '''The external forces''', represent the action of other bodies on the rigid body under consideration; '''The internal forces''' are the forces which hold together the particles forming the rigid body. The body is only able to change its motion if it can push or pull against some external object. Only  external forces can impart to the rigid body a motion. '''Rigid body'''  makes analysis simple with less parameters that describe the configuration of the system to the translation and rotation of reference frames attached to each body.&lt;ref&gt;B. Paul, Kinematics and Dynamics of Planar Machinery, Prentice-Hall, NJ, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. W. Tsai, Robot Analysis: The mechanics of serial and parallel manipulators, John-Wiley, NY, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;'''Rigid-body mechanics''' studies the movement of interconnected bodies' system under the action of external forces.

===Kinematics===
'''Kinematics''' describes the motion of points, bodies (objects) and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without consideration of the causes of motion. It is the branch of biomechanics concerned with the study of movement from a geometrical point of view.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whittaker&quot;&gt;

====Type of Motions====
Motions are classified into '''translation''' and '''rotation''' according to a fixed axis, general plane motion and motion about a fixed pin.

* '''Translation'''('''Linear Motion'''):A motion is said to be a translation if any straight line inside the body keeps the same direction during the movement.All the particles forming the body move along parallel paths. If these paths are straight lines, the motion is said a '''rectilinear translation'''. If the paths are curved lines, the motion is a curvilinear motion.
* '''Rotation''' about a fixed axis('''Angular Motion'''): Most of the individual limb motions are angular. The particles forming the rigid body move in parallel planes along circles centered on the same fixed axis. If this axis, called the axis of rotation intersects the rigid body, the particles located on the axis have zero velocity and zero acceleration.
* '''General plane motion''':Any plane motion which is neither a translation or a rotation is defined as a general plane motion. Plan motion is that in which all the particles of the body move in parallel planes. Translation and rotation are plane motions.
* '''Motion about a fixed point''':The three-dimensional motion of a rigid body attached at a fixed point, for example, the motion of a top on a rough floor, is known as motion about a fixed point.
*'''General motion''':Any motion of a rigid body which does not fall in any of the cathegories above described.

===='''Position'''====
'''Position'''(also called '''Displacement''') means an object’s location at any particular time.
====Velocity====
'''Velocity''' is defined as the rate at which location changes with time.

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Velocity}_{\mathrm{average}} = {\Delta \mathbf{location} \over \Delta time}={\Delta S \over \Delta time}&lt;/math&gt;

====Acceleration====
'''Acceleration''' is the rate at which velocity changes with time.

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Acceleration}_{\mathrm{average}} = {\Delta \mathbf{Velocity} \over \Delta time}={{Velocity}_{final}-{Velocity}_{initial} \over {Time}_{final}-{Time}_{initial}} &lt;/math&gt;

===Kinetics===
'''Kinetics''' is the branch of biomechanics concerned with what causes a body to move the way it does. 
====Newton’s Laws of Motion====
'''Newton's laws of motion''' are three fundamental laws for classical mechanics. They describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and its motion to the forces.
# '''Newton's first law''' : If a body is at rest it remains at rest or if it is in motion it moves with uniform velocity until it is acted on by a resultant force.&lt;ref name=&quot;newton1&quot;&gt;Duncan, Tom. Advanced Physics for Hong Kong: Volume 1 Mechanics &amp; Electricity. John Murray Ltd, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;The first law can be stated mathematically as &lt;math&gt;\sum F=0&lt;/math&gt;  ⇔  &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}/\mathrm{d} t=0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
# '''Newton's second law''':Acceleration is dependent on the forces acting upon an object and the mass of the object. Change in momentum is proportional to external force and reversely proportional to its mass. It can be  stated mathematically as &lt;math&gt; F=ma= \mathrm{d} \mathbf{v}/\mathrm{d}t &lt;/math&gt;.To consider rigid body three-dimensionally, Newton's second law should be extended to define the relationship between the movement of a rigid body and the system of forces and torques that act on it.
# '''Newton's third law''':For all force, there is an equal and opposite force. If one object A exerts a force F&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; on a second object B, then B simultaneously exerts a force F&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; on A: F&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;= −F&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newton3&quot;&gt;Resnick; Halliday; Krane (1992). Physics, Volume 1 (4th ed.). p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Internal Biomechanics===

==Tissue MechanicsI(Bone)==
===Microscopic bone structure===
[[File:Illu compact spongy bone.jpg|thumb|400px|Cross-section of a long bone showing both spongy and compact osseous tissue]]
Two types of bone can be founded microscopically up to the pattern of collagen forming the osteoid (collagenous support tissue of type I collagen embedded in glycosaminoglycan gel):

* '''Woven bone''' is characterized by randomly oriented collagen fibers. It is isotropic and mechanically weak&lt;ref name=&quot;Curry2006&quot;&gt;Curry, J.D. 2006. &quot;The Structure of Bone Tissue&quot; &lt;u&gt;Bones: Structure and Mechanics&lt;/u&gt; Princeton U. Press. Princeton, NJ. pps: 12–14&lt;/ref&gt;. It is actively resolved by 1 year.

* '''Lamellar bone''' has a highly organized parallel alignment of collagen into sheets (lamellae). It is anisotropic and mechanically strong &lt;ref name=&quot;Curry2006&quot; /&gt;.

===Bone Tissue:Cortical(Compact) Bone===
'''Cortical bone''',also called compact bone, dense bone in which the bony matrix is solidly filled with collage and Hydroxylapatite, leaving only tiny spaces (lacunae) that contain the osteocytes, or bone cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;cortical&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/129490/compact-bone Encyclopedia Britanica,compact bone]&lt;/ref&gt;Its porosity is 5–30%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall, Susan Pg. 88&quot;&gt;Hall, Susan. (2007) ''Basic Biomechanics''. Fifth Edition. p. 88 ISBN 0-07-126041-2&lt;/ref&gt;  Compact bone makes up 80 percent of the human skeleton.Cortical bone forms the cortex, or outer shell, of most bones&lt;ref name=&quot;cortical&quot; /&gt; .

===Bone Tissue:Trabecullar(Cancellous or spongy) Bone===
Compared to compact bone, cancellous bone has a higher surface area to mass ratio because it is less dense.It's porosity is %30-90&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall, Susan Pg. 88&quot; /&gt;. It is composed of a network of rod- and plate-like elements that make the overall organ lighter and allow room for blood vessels and marrow  where haematopoiesis, the production of blood cells, occurs. Cancellous bone is typically found at the ends of long bones, proximal to joints and within the interior of vertebrae.
===Bone Tissue Type and Implant===
# '''Type I''' bone is very hard and dense like oak wood as it contains mostly lamellae bone. This type of bone has less blood supply than all of the rest of the types of bone. The blood supply is required for the bone to harden or calcify the bone for the implant. Therefore, it needs approximately 5 months for this type to integrate with an implant&lt;ref name=&quot;bonetype&quot;&gt;http://www.americanortho.com/downloads/aarhus/Bone_types.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.
#'''Type II plexiform bone''' isn’t as hard as '''type I'''. It is composed of layers of lamellae and woven bone. This type of bone usually takes 4 months to integrate with an implant&lt;ref name=&quot;bonetype&quot; /&gt;
#'''Type III Haversian''' bone is composed of Harversian canal, concentric lamellae, lacunae with osteocytes and canaliculi.It is like balsa wood and less dense then type II. Because of lower density, it takes more time to work with an implant. 6 months time is suggested before loading an implant placed in this bone. Extended gradual loading of the implant could improve the bone density&lt;ref name=&quot;bonetype&quot; /&gt;.
#'''Type IV cancellous bone''' is the least dense of all of the bone types&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall, Susan Pg. 88&quot; /&gt;.This type takes the longest time to work with the implant after placement, which is usually 8 months. Additional implants is necessary to improve implant/bone loading distribution. Bone grafting or augmentation of bone are often needed. Bone expansion and or bone manipulation can improve initial implant fixation&lt;ref name=&quot;bonetype&quot; /&gt;.

===Bone Cells===
[[File:604 Bone cells.jpg|300 px|thumb|Bone cells]]
Bone cells are classified into four categories:'''osteoclasts''' destroy bones,'''osteoblasts''' build bones,'''osteocytes''' hold the bone together and '''lining cells''',  protect the bone.
====osteoclast====
'''Osteoclasts''' are usually found in bone surface called '''resorptive pits'''. Osteoclasts are large multinucleate cells that are responsible for the breakdown of bones&lt;ref name=&quot;osteoclast&quot;&gt;[http://jcs.biologists.org/content/113/3/377.full.pdf H. Kalervo Väänänen et al,Journal of Cell Science 113, 377-381 (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;. The breakdown of bone is very important in bone health as it allows for bone remodeling. Osteoclasts are formed by the joining of many different cells created from the bone marrow that travel in the circulatory system&lt;ref name=&quot;osteoclast&quot; /&gt;. Local acidic environment through H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enhance the solubility of hyaluronic acid. High molecular weight hyaluronic acid regulates osteoclast formation by inhibiting receptor activator of NF-κB ligand through Rho kinase&lt;ref name=&quot;osteoha&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24185105 Ariyoshi W et al.Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2014 Jan;22(1):111-20]&lt;/ref&gt;.

====osteoblasts====
'''Osteoblasts''' is primarily composed of Type I collagen. The osteoblast creates and repairs new bone by actually building around itself. After the osteoblast is finished working, it is actually trapped inside of the bone. When the osteoblast becomes trapped, it becomes known as an osteocyte&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Michael. &quot;DrTummy.com | DrTummy.com.&quot; DrTummy.com | DrTummy.com. Dr. Tummy, n.d. Web. 03 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====osteocytes====
'''Osteocytes''' are mature osteoblasts which have become trapped inside of lacunae surrounded by bone matrix. The osteocytes are numerous and believed to communicate with stress/strain signal&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bone Cells.&quot; ASBMR Educational Materials. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;.

====lining cells====
Bone lining cells come from osteoblasts which have become flattened. Bone lining cells are for the immediate release of calcium] in the bone if calcium in the blood is too low. Bone lining cells are also important in the protection of the bone from harmful chemicals. And bone lining cells are responsible for the maintenance of the bone fluids&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bone Cells.&quot; ASBMR Educational Materials. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Biomechanical Behaviour of Bone===
====Cortical Bone====
It has relatively high compressive strength of about 170 MPa (1800 kgf/cm²)&lt;ref name=Schmidt-Nielsen&gt;{{Cite journal |year=1984 |author=Schmidt-Nielsen, Knut |authorlink=Knut Schmidt-Nielsen |title=Scaling: Why Is Animal Size So Important? |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=6|isbn=0-521-31987-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  but poor tensile strength of 104–121 MPa and very low shear stress strength (51.6 MPa)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00223-001-1006-1|title=Shear Strength and Fatigue Properties of Human Cortical Bone Determined from Pure Shear Tests|year=2001|last1=Turner|first1=C.H.|last2=Wang|first2=T.|last3=Burr|first3=D.B.|journal=Calcified Tissue International|volume=69|issue=6|pages=373–378|pmid=11800235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Trabecular Bone====
Elastic behaviours depends on the anatomic sites, age, connectivity and so on. Modulus and strength are weak dependent on the strain rate&lt;ref name=&quot;trabecularmechanic&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3323197 Goldstein SA. J. Biomech. 1987;20(11-12):1055-61]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tissue MechanicsII(Cartillage, Muscle, Ligament, Tendon)==
[[File:Histological Architecture of the Joint Surface.jpg|200 px|left|thumb|Histological Architecture of the Joint Surface]]
All connective tissue including bone and adipose is characterized by distinctive cells surrouded by an extraceullar matrix within a ground substance. The tissue is characterized based on the extracellular matrix. Blood is also belong to the connective tissue. Special connective tissue consists of reticular connective tissue, adipose tissue, cartilage, bone, and blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caceci|first=Thomas|title=Connective Tisues|url=http://www.vetmed.vt.edu/education/curriculum/vm8054/labs/lab5/lab5.htm|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
===Cartillage===
Cartilage is  a flexible and rubbery but strong supportive connective tissue&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/ap/histology_mh/cartilag.html. Tissues of the human body McGrawHill] &lt;/ref&gt; Cartilage consists of cells called chondrocytes which are dispersed in a firm gel-like ground substance and  produce and maintain the cartilaginous matrix composed mainly of collagen and proteoglycans.Cartilage is avascular (contains no blood vessels) and nutrients are diffused through the matrix. Cartilage is found in many areas in the bodies of humans and other animals, including the joints between bones, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the bronchial tubes and the intervertebral discs.

There are three main types of cartilage: hyaline, elastic and fibrocartilage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pratt|first=Rebecca|title=Supporting Tissue: Cartilage|url=https://app.anatomyone.com/systemic/skeletal-system/supporting-tissue-cartilage#|work=AnatomyOne|publisher=Amirsys, Inc|accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
{{Clear}}
====Hyaline cartillage====
The type of protein fiber embedded within the matrix of cartilage determines the cartilage type&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/277945/hyaline-cartilage Britanica, Hyaline cartillage]&lt;/ref&gt;. It contains no nerves or blood vessels, and its structure is relatively simple. Hyaline cartilage matrix is mostly composed of type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate, both of which are also found in elastic cartilage.  The optical density of these fibers is the same as the ground substance surrounding them and as a result, they are not visible within the extracellular matrix.  Hyaline cartilage subsequently appears as a very uniform, glossy type tissue with evenly dispersed chondrocytes in lacunae.  Typically, Hyaline cartilage is covered by the perichondrium, except at the articular ends of bones. It is found directly under the skin, i.e. ears and nose. This membrane contains vessels that provide the cartilage with nutrition.

'''Articular cartilage''' indicates hyaline cartilage on the articular surfaces of bones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/articular_cartilage]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;niharticular&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3445147/ Alice J. Sophia Fox, MSc Sports Health. Nov 2009; 1(6): 461–468.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Elastic cartillage====
'''Elastic cartilage''' or '''yellow cartilage''' is found in the pharyngotympanic(eusatachian) tubes, epiglottis, and ear lobes where needs dictate supportive tissues possess elasticity.It contains elastic fiber networks and collagen fibers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emedicinehealth.com/script/main/srchcont_dict.asp?src=elastic+cartilage emedicine health,elastic cartillage]&lt;/ref&gt; The principal protein is elastin.

====Fibrocartillage====
Fibrocartilage(fibrous) contains  type I collagen in addition to the normal type IIarranged in layered arrays. compared to the very uniform appearance of hyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage possesses a more open or spongey architecture with gaps between lacunae and collagen fiber bundles. Fibrocartilage is found in the pubic symphysis, the anulus fibrosus of intervertebral discs, menisci, and the TMJ.It helps fill in the torn part of the cartilage; but, it is not enough for the replacement of the smooth, glassy articular cartilage that normally covers the surface of joints. The tendon transforms into fibrocartilage when subjected to compression&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/12642 Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics
]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Articular Cartillage===
'''Articular cartilage''' is the loadbearing connective tissue of diarthrodial joints&lt;ref name=&quot;niharticular&quot; /&gt;. Surface is a large extracellular membrane(proteoglycans, collagens, water) with a sparse population of condrocytes&lt;ref name=&quot;articularnih2&gt;Mow VC, Ratcliffe A, Poole AR. Cartilage and diarthrodial joints as paradigms for hierarchical materials and structures. Biomaterials. 1992;13:67-97&lt;/ref&gt;.

Along with collagen fiber ultrastructure and ECM, chondrocytes contribute to the zones of articular cartilage—the superficial zone, the middle zone, the deep zone, and the calcified zone. Collagen is main structural macromolecule in ECM, and it occupy about 60% of the dry weight of cartilage. Type II collagen represents 90% to 95% of the collagen in ECM and forms fibrils and fibers intertwined with proteoglycan aggregates together along hyaluronic acid core. Collagen types I, IV, V, VI, IX, and XI also exist but contribute only a minor proportion. The minor collagens help to form and make the type II collagen fibril network stable. Water represents between 65% and 80% of the total weight.The relative water concentration decreases from about 80% at the superficial zone to 65% in the deep zone&lt;ref&gt;Buckwalter JA, Mankin HJ. Articular cartilage, part 1: tissue design and chondrocyte-matrix interaction. J Bone Joint Surg Am. 1997;79:600-611&lt;/ref&gt;.Water and proteoglycans are critical to its ability to resist compressive loads.

Its principal function is to provide a smooth, lubricated surface for articulation and to facilitate the transmission of loads with a low frictional coefficient. The mechanical behavior of this tissue is dependent on the interaction of its fluid and solid components&lt;ref name=&quot;niharticular&quot; /&gt;.

===Ligament and Tendon===
[[File:Ligament tendon.jpg|300px|thumb|Ligament &amp; Tendon]]
A tendon is a tough fibrous bands of connective tissue that usually attaches muscle to bone. Tendons may also connect muscles to structures such as the eyeball. A tendon serves to move the bone or structure. A ligament is a short,fibrous bands of connective tissue which attaches bone to bone, and usually serves to hold structures together and stabilize them&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/19089.htm MedlinePlus]&lt;/ref&gt;. Ligament and tendon are different in the connection to the system. But, ligament and tendon are dense connective tissue and microscopically similar to including composition.

Note: This documentation is for an '''experimental''' feature of OpenSCAD that is not in any released version of OpenSCAD. It is not associated with the official OpenSCAD release in any way. 

This patch was based on QT, but QT is being phased out of the 'guts' of OpenSCAD and so this will have to be reimplimeneted in another manner preferably in consultation with openscad leaders on the mailing list. 

Source code for this patch is at the following url:

https://github.com/donbright/openscad/compare/surfaceimg

-----

'''Using image files'''

In addition to simple .dat files, surface() can also read .png, .jpg, .bmp, and many other formats; anything listed in the [http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/qimagereader.html#supportedImageFormats QPixmap documentation] should work. It operates, roughly, by considering the image as 'grayscale' (only black, white, and shades of gray). It then assigns each pixel a value between 0 and 255, and those become the 'height' of the 'landscape'.

'''Example Usage''':

Consider the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap wikipedia page for Heightmap]. It contains a public domain .png file from user A3r0:

[[File:Heightmap.png]]

Using surface(), you can do this in OpenSCAD:

 scale([1,1,0.1]) surface(&quot;heightmap.png&quot;,center=true);

[[File:Openscad heightmap patchx.png]]

It should be noted, however, that such large objects will take an inordinate amount of time and memory for OpenSCAD to render into STL.</text>

&lt;br clear=all&gt;
=&lt;big&gt;A&lt;/big&gt;=
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
;Actuation Ratio :In general, the change of input action divided by the change of output effect.   In bicycles, it is most mentioned in relation to  the indexed shifting of derailleurs, where it refers to the change in length of the shift cable divided by the transverse change in position of the derailleur across the cogs.   Although the handlebar shifter no doubt has an actuation ratio of its own, it is the length of cable shifted that is of interest to indexed shifting.   The reciprocal of actuation ratio is called the ''shift ratio'', and this ratio is used more often.   Typical figures for derailleur shift ratio are 1.7 for Shimano, 1.1 for the native SRAM set, and 1.5 for Campagnolo.   In addition, SRAM makes a family of Shimano compatible shifter products with the appropriate cable shifts.

=&lt;big&gt;B&lt;/big&gt;=
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
;&lt;nowiki&gt;'B-height'&lt;/nowiki&gt; adjustment: One of the three main derailleur adjustments.   It sets the distance of the guide pulley below the largest cog.   It is important for clean shifting and low cog / chain wear. 
;Barrel-adjuster:A screw adjustment that is installed in-line with brake or shift housings to simulate a change in the housings length.   This causes a movement of the cable within the housing.   Cable with housing is referred to as a Bowden cable. 
;Bowden cable: The combination of a steel cable in a reinforced flexible housing that is used to operate brakes and derailleurs.
;Brake:The assembly on the wheel that brings the bicycle to a halt.   It applies friction to a part of the wheel, for example the wheel rim or within the hub.   Most bicycles have a brake on each wheel.   
;Brake arms: The parts of a brake assembly near the wheel the that pivot and provide any necessary leverage to assist in the application of the brake pads.
;Brake balancing:The process whereby both brake pads are caused to reach the wheel rim at the same time.   This ensures stability in braking.
;Brake cable:The steel wire cable that connects a brake lever to the brake arms, used to operate the brakes. A part of a Bowden cable. 
;Brake housing: The reinforced, flexible cable conduit used by the brake cable. A part of a Bowden cable. 
;Brake lever:The lever on the handlebars operated by the rider to make a brake work.    
;Brake pads: The parts, usually rubber or leather, that come into contact with both sides of a wheel's rim to brake it.

=&lt;big&gt;C&lt;/big&gt;=
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
;Cable: A twisted steel wire that is used to operate brakes and derailleurs.   Diameters vary between about 1.2mm and 1.5mm.
;Cable cap:A small metal piece that fits onto the end of a cut cable to prevent its fraying.   It is either crimped or soldered.  
;Cable clamp:Screwed fastenings at brakes and derailleurs used to fix cable ends.
;Cable cutters:Special cutters that can cut tough steel cable. They are also used to cut reinforced cable housings.   Both blades have v-shaped cutouts to avoid crushing the housing's end.
;Cable housing:The outer part of a Bowden cable that acts as a conduit for the steel inner wire.   It is supplied in both 4 and 5mm external diameters.
;Cable sleeve: The lubricated cable route within the outer housing of a Bowden cable.     
;Cable terminal: The thickened end part of a cable that is designed to fit into shifters or brake levers, and acts as an anchor there.   There are ''barrel-ends'' for the brakes of bikes with non-drop handlebars, ''pear-ends'' for racers, and ''button-ends'' for shifters.

=&lt;big&gt;D&lt;/big&gt;=
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
;Derailleur:The assembly near a wheel that moves the chain from one cog to another in order to change the ease of pedalling.   It does so when the rider operates a ''shifter'' on the handlebars.  Derailleurs exist for both the rear cogs and for the front chainrings, so increasing the number of gear combinations.
;Derailleur capacity: The extent to which the chain can be made to tighten when a gear is selected that uses smaller cogs.   The most severe test of a derailleur's capacity (total capacity) occurs when there is a shift from using the ''largest'' cogs on front and back, to using the ''smallest'' cogs on front and back.   ''Total capacity'' is therefore expressed as the front chainring range plus the rear cog range (measured in ''teeth'') , and decides a derailleur's suitability for given gear-sets.   Derailleurs are made in so-called low, medium, and long-cage families for small, medium, and large total capacities respectively.
;Derailleur hanger: A sacrificial metal plate that is fixed between the bicycle frame and the derailleur, designed to bend on impact instead of the other equipment.  These differ greatly between bikes, and generally speaking are hardly ever interchangeable.   Each has a lip whose angle sets the upper limit of the derailleur's &lt;nowiki&gt;'B-height'&lt;/nowiki&gt; adjustment.

=&lt;big&gt;E&lt;/big&gt;=
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
=&lt;big&gt;F&lt;/big&gt;=
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
;Ferrule:A metal or plastic cap that is used on both ends of a Bowden cable's housing, to ensure alignment of the internal sleeve and to provide a good bearing surface.  The inner cable extends through the ferrule while the housing's end is sealed.   They are most often pressed on as a tight fit, but some are crimped onto housings.   They are supplied with internal diameters of either 4 or 5mm.   Ferrules come into contact with cable stops on frames or make a loose fit in the ends of barrel adjusters, and sometimes the ferrules for these purposes differ.   Sometimes housing ferrules also have curved metal transitions, to better guide an inner cable at the brakes.

=&lt;big&gt;G&lt;/big&gt;=
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
;Gear-inches: A measure of the difficulty in pedalling.   It is a calculated figure based on the two cogs in use at the time, and the diameter of the driven wheel. It is just the ratio of the front chainring and the rear cog (in ''teeth''), times the diameter of the driven wheel (in ''inches''). The gear-inch  figures are used to plan gearing for the various riders' needs, and the road distance traveled with one complete turn of the pedals can be found by multiplying the gear-inch figures by the constant ''pi'' (3.142).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
This book is intended for readers who need to deploy standard statistical techniques for data analysis but do not have statistical training.  In particular it might be useful for readers of the wikibook [[Using_SPSS_and_PASW|Using SPSS and PASW]].

It is possible to get by in applied statistics without ''any'' real mathematical understanding of what you are doing, but it cannot be recommended.  This book starts from the assumption that even flying by the seat of your pants, it is worth knowing how to measure wind-speed.

The content was determined by listing what an undergraduate social science student might have to learn on a non-specialist course in statistics or applied statistics and then stripping it to the bare bones and especially avoiding much mathematical detail.

There is no coverage of probability, which is one of the foundations of modern statistical thinking, just because it is the author's belief that if really necessary, you can get by without - well almost.  Probability rears its head but this book relies only on naive, intuitive ideas of the probable.

I want to stress that I do not think anyone should get by without developing a proper understanding of statistical methods but if you find yourself having to analyse data or perform a test and do not know where to start, this book might help.

I assume that the reader will use a suitable computer application (SPSS, Minitab, Stata are examples) and so although I give brief explanations of some calculations, I don't cover the use of statistical tables to find significance values.

===Two uses of statistics===

====Describing the world====
Descriptive statistics is a way of formalising the measurable characteristics of the world.  From the standpoint of scientific investigation we often isolate some part of the world of experience and simplify it for the purpose of observation and measurement.  In descriptive statistics we concentrate on the quantifiable aspects of what we investigate and try to characterise it in a useful way.  Our aim is to distinguish things that are unalike in relevant ways and to make clear similarities between things that may on the surface appear quite different.

====Testing theories about the world====

Science aims to explain our experience by offering a theory that accounts for it.  Theories are explanatory accounts that consist (among other things) of one or more hypotheses about the elements of experience.  These hypotheses might be, for example that ''x is very like y''; ''p is very often associated with q''; ''t is generally half the value of r  multiplied by s''.  Perhaps all the ''x, y''s and ''z''s don't help but we can find an example that might.  Suppose that we believe that the amount of sweat (measured as the area of patches on clothing) a football player produces depends upon the amount of time she is in possession of the ball and the environmental temperature.  We could try model this as

''sweat patch area = environmental temperature + possession time''

now this is a very unlikely model.  Marginally more likely is that there are some ''coefficients'' that would be needed in this equation if it could work at all.  But we can ask whether these coefficients exist such that

''sweat patch area = (environmental temperature * a) + (possession time * c) ± noise''

and it turns out that many relationships between phenomena in the world are governed by equations that are something like this.  Statistical analysis can tell us if there is such an equation and how reliable its predictions are.

===How significance testing works===

Imagine that I have a drawer full of socks - six unmatched socks, each a different colour from red, blue, green, orange, yellow, grey.  If I pull two socks out at random, what are the chances that I will pull out a red and a blue together?  The possible combinations for a pull are:

red blue

red green

red orange

red yellow

red gray

blue green

blue orange

blue yellow

blue gray

green orange

green yellow

green gray

orange yellow

orange grey

yellow gray

(If you remember anything about permutations this is n!/(p! (n-p)!)

In short the chance of getting the red-blue combination is 1/15.  In fact you can work out the probability of any mix on a pull of any number of socks.  We can know how likely - and conversely how unlikely - a combination is.  Now, lets imagine that there are ten socks of each colour in the drawer.  We can calculate the probability for any pull of any number as before.  Now, imagine that we don't know how many socks of each colour are in the drawer though we know there are six possible colours and sixty socks over all.  I make a pull of socks - say five at a time.  Suppose that I get 

green green blue red orange 

We can compute how unlikely this is if in fact there are equal numbers of each colour sock in the drawer.  Some combinations will be comfortably likely given an equal distribution of sock colours but some will be very unlikely on that assumption.

So, if we wanted to bet on whether there were in fact equal numbers of each colour sock in the drawer we could proceed like this

# Make the null hypothesis that there are equal numbers of each colour sock in the drawer
# Set a level of confidence we require - we'd like to be wrong (and lose money!) no more than 5% of the time for example
# Make a pull
# Compute how unlikely this pull is given the null hypothesis

If we get results that are wildly different from what is likely on the assumption of the null hypothesis we will feel confident in rejecting it, otherwise we will be cautious and will say that we have no grounds to reject it.

Many statistical tests involve the computation of a statistic which is taken to be drawn from a particular distribution of values.  This distritbution is our sock drawer.  A given value for this statistic will be more or less likely on the null hypothesis and this likelihood is called the '''''p value'''''.  We decide what degree of confidence we will be satisfied by (that is we allow that we may be mislead some fraction of the time) and then calculate whether on the numbers before us we should reject the null hypothesis - ''how extreme,'' we ask ourselves, ''is the statistic in this case?''.  If the '''''p value''''' on this occasion is less than the level of confidence then it is too extreme to accept the null hypothesis.

This tutorial covers '''textures for light attenuation''' or — more generally spoken — textures as lookup tables. 

It is based on {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Cookies}}. If you haven't read that tutorial yet, you should read it first. 

===Texture Maps as Lookup Tables===
One can think of a texture map as an approximation to a two-dimensional function that maps the texture coordinates to an RGBA color. If one of the two texture coordinates is kept fixed, the texture map can also represent a one-dimensional function. Thus, it is often possible to replace mathematical expressions that depend only on one or two variables by lookup tables in the form of texture maps. (The limitation is that the resolution of the texture map is limited by the size of the texture image and therefore the accuracy of a texture lookup might be insufficient.) 

The main advantage of using such a texture lookup is a potential gain of performance: a texture lookup doesn't depend on the complexity of the mathematical expression but only on the size of the texture image (to a certain degree: the smaller the texture image the more efficient the caching up to the point where the whole texture fits into the cache). However, there is an overhead of using a texture lookup; thus, replacing simple mathematical expressions — including built-in functions — is usually pointless. 

Which mathematical expressions should be replaced by texture lookups? Unfortunately, there is no general answer because it depends on the specific GPU whether a specific lookup is faster than evaluating a specific mathematical expression. However, one should keep in mind that a texture map is less simple (since it requires code to compute the lookup table), less explicit (since the mathematical function is encoded in a lookup table), less consistent with other mathematical expressions, and has a wider scope (since the texture is available in the whole fragment shader). These are good reasons to avoid lookup tables. However, the gains in performance might outweigh these reasons. In that case, it is a good idea to include comments that document how to achieve the same effect without the lookup table.

===Unity's Texture Lookup for Light Attenuation===
Unity actually uses a lookup texture &lt;code&gt;_LightTextureB0&lt;/code&gt; internally for the light attenuation of point lights and spotlights. (Note that in some cases, e.g. point lights without cookie textures, this lookup texture is set to &lt;code&gt;_LightTexture0&lt;/code&gt; without &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;. This case is ignored here.) In {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Diffuse Reflection}}, it was described how to implement linear attenuation: we compute an attenuation factor that includes one over the distance between the position of the light source in world space and the position of the rendered fragment in world space. In order to represent this distance, Unity uses the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; coordinate in light space. Light space coordinates have been discussed in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Cookies}}; here, it is only important that we can use the Unity-specific uniform matrix &lt;code&gt;_LightMatrix0&lt;/code&gt; to transform a position from world space to light space. Analogously to the code in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Cookies}}, we store the position in light space in the varying variable &lt;code&gt;positionInLightSpace&lt;/code&gt;. We can then use the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; coordinate of this varying to look up the attenuation factor in the alpha component of the texture &lt;code&gt;_LightTextureB0&lt;/code&gt; in the fragment shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
               float distance = positionInLightSpace.z; 
                  // use z coordinate in light space as signed distance
               attenuation = 
                  texture2D(_LightTextureB0, vec2(distance)).a; 
                  // texture lookup for attenuation               
               // alternative with linear attenuation: 
               //    float distance = length(vertexToLightSource);
               //    attenuation = 1.0 / distance;
&lt;/source&gt;
Using the texture lookup, we don't have to compute the length of a vector (which involves three squares and one square root) and we don't have to divide by this length.
In fact, the actual attenuation function that is implemented in the lookup table is more complicated in order to avoid saturated colors at short distances. Thus, compared to a computation of this actual attenuation function, we save even more operations. 

===Complete Shader Code===
The shader code is based on the code of {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Cookies}}. The &lt;code&gt;ForwardBase&lt;/code&gt; pass was slightly simplified by assuming that the light source is always directional without attenuation. The vertex shader of the &lt;code&gt;ForwardAdd&lt;/code&gt; pass is identical to the code in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Cookies}} but the fragment shader includes the texture lookup for light attenuation, which is described above. However, the fragment shader lacks the cookie attenuation in order to focus on the attenuation with distance. It is straightforward (and a good exercise) to include the code for the cookie again.
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;

   Properties {
      _Color (&quot;Diffuse Material Color&quot;, Color) = (1,1,1,1)

            vec3 specularReflection;

            }
            else // light source on the right side
            {
               specularReflection = attenuation * vec3(_LightColor0) 
                  * vec3(_SpecColor) * pow(max(0.0, dot(

      }
   } 
   // The definition of a fallback shader should be commented out 
   // during development:
   // Fallback &quot;Specular&quot;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
If you compare the lighting computed by this shader with the lighting of a built-in shader, you will notice a difference in intensity by a factor of about 2 to 4. However, this is mainly due to additional constant factors in the built-in shaders. It is straightforward to introduce similar constant factors in the code above.

It should be noted that the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; coordinate in light space is not equal to the distance from the light source; it's not even proportional to that distance. In fact, the meaning of the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; coordinate depends on the matrix &lt;code&gt;_LightMatrix0&lt;/code&gt;, which is an undocumented feature of Unity and can therefore change anytime. However, it is rather safe to assume that a value of 0 corresponds to very close positions and a value of 1 corresponds to farther positions.

Also note that point lights without cookie textures specify the attenuation lookup texture in &lt;code&gt;_LightTexture0&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;_LightTextureB0&lt;/code&gt;; thus, the code above doesn't work for them. Moreover, the code doesn't check the sign of the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; coordinate, which is fine for spot lights but results in a lack of attenuation on one side of point light sources.

===Computing Lookup Textures===
So far, we have used a lookup texture that is provided by Unity. If Unity wouldn't provide us with the texture in &lt;code&gt;_LightTextureB0&lt;/code&gt;, we had to compute this texture ourselves. Here is some JavaScript code to compute a similar lookup texture. In order to use it, you have to change the name &lt;code&gt;_LightTextureB0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;_LookupTexture&lt;/code&gt; in the shader code and attach the following JavaScript to any game object with the corresponding material:

&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode()

public var upToDate : boolean = false;

function Start()
{
   upToDate = false;
}

function Update() 
{
   if (!upToDate) // is lookup texture not up to date? 
   {
      upToDate = true;
      var texture = new Texture2D(16, 16); 
         // width = 16 texels, height = 16 texels
      texture.filterMode = FilterMode.Bilinear;
      texture.wrapMode = TextureWrapMode.Clamp;
      
      renderer.sharedMaterial.SetTexture(&quot;_LookupTexture&quot;, texture); 
         // &quot;_LookupTexture&quot; has to correspond to the name  
         // of the uniform sampler2D variable in the shader
      for (var j : int = 0; j &lt; texture.height; j++)
      {
         for (var i : int = 0; i &lt; texture.width; i++)
         {
            var x : float = (i + 0.5) / texture.width; 
               // first texture coordinate
            var y : float = (j + 0.5) / texture.height;  
               // second texture coordinate
            var color = Color(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, (1.0 - x) * (1.0 - x)); 
               // set RGBA of texels
            texture.SetPixel(i, j, color);
         }
      }
      texture.Apply(); // apply all the texture.SetPixel(...) commands
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
In this code, &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; enumerate the texels of the texture image while &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; represent the corresponding texture coordinates. The function &lt;code&gt;(1.0-x)*(1.0-x)&lt;/code&gt; for the alpha component of the texture image happens to produce similar results as compared to Unity's lookup texture. 

Note that the lookup texture should not be computed in every frame. Rather it should be computed only when necessary. If a lookup texture depends on additional parameters, then the texture should only be recomputed if any parameter has been changed. This can be achieved by storing the parameter values for which a lookup texture has been computed and continuously checking whether any of the new parameters are different from these stored values. If this is the case, the lookup texture has to be recomputed.

===Summary===
Congratulations, you have reached the end of this tutorial. We have seen:
* How to use the built-in texture &lt;code&gt;_LightTextureB0&lt;/code&gt; as a lookup table for light attenuation.
* How to compute your own lookup textures in JavaScript.

===Further Reading===
If you still want to know more 
* about light attenuation for light sources, you should read {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Diffuse Reflection}}.
* about basic texture mapping, you should read {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Textured Spheres}}.
* about coordinates in light space, you should read {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Cookies}}.
* about the SECS principles (simple, explicit, consistent, minimal scope), you could read Chapter 3 of David Straker's book “C Style: Standards and Guidelines”, published by Prentice-Hall in 1991, which is available [http://syque.com/cstyle/index.htm online].

[[File:OHP-sch.JPG|250px|thumb|left|An overhead projector.]]
This tutorial covers '''projective texture mapping for projectors''', which are particular rendering components of Unity. 

It is based on {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Cookies}}. If you haven't read that tutorial yet, you should read it first. 

===Unity's Projectors===
Unity's projectors are somewhat similar to spotlights. In fact, they can be used for similar applications. There is, however, an important technical difference: For spotlights, the shaders of all lit objects have to compute the lighting by the spotlight as discussed in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Cookies}}. If the shader of an object ignores the spotlight, it just won't be lit by the spotlight. This is different for projectors: Each projector is associated with a material with a shader that is applied to any object in the projector's range. Thus, an object's shader doesn't need to deal with the projector; instead, the projector applies its shader to all objects in its range as an additional render pass in order to achieve certain effects, e.g. adding the light of a projected image or attenuating the color of an object to fake a shadow. In fact, various effects can be achieved by using different blend equations of the projector's shader. (Blend equations are discussed in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Transparency}}.)

One might even consider projectors as the more “natural” way of implementing lights. However, the interaction between light and materials is usually specific to each material while the single shader of a projector cannot deal with all these differences. This limits the possibilities of projectors to three basic behaviors: adding light to an object, modulating an object's color, or both, adding light and modulating the object's color. We will look at adding light to an object and attenuating an object's colors as an example of modulating them.

===Projectors for Adding Light===
In order to create a projector, choose '''GameObject &gt; Create Empty''' from the main menu and then (with the new object still selected) '''Component &gt; Effects &gt; Projector''' from the main menu. You have now a projector that can be manipulated similarly to a spotlight. The settings of the projector in the '''Inspector View''' are discussed in [http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/Components/class-Projector.html Unity's reference manual]. Here, the only important setting is the projector's '''Material''', which will be applied to all objects in its range. Thus, we have to create another material and assign a suitable shader to it. This shader usually doesn't have access to the materials of the game objects, which it is applied to; therefore, it doesn't have access to their textures etc. Neither does it have access to any information about light sources. However, it has access to the attributes of the vertices of the game objects and its own shader properties.

A shader to add light to objects could be used to project any image onto other objects, similarly to an overhead projector or a movie projector. Thus, it should use a texture image similar to a cookie for spotlights (see {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Cookies}}) except that the RGB colors of the texture image should be added to allow for colored projections. We achieve this by setting the fragment color to the RGBA color of the texture image and using the blend equation

&lt;code&gt;Blend One One&lt;/code&gt;

which just adds the fragment color to the color in the framebuffer. (Depending on the texture image, it might be better to use &lt;code&gt;Blend SrcAlpha One&lt;/code&gt; in order to remove any colors with zero opacity.) 

Another difference to the cookies of spotlights is that we should use the Unity-specific uniform matrix &lt;code&gt;_Projector&lt;/code&gt; to transform positions from object space to projector space instead of the matrix &lt;code&gt;_LightMatrix0&lt;/code&gt;. However, coordinates in projector space work very similar to coordinates in light space — except that the resulting &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; coordinates are in the correct range; thus, we don't have to bother with adding 0.5. Nonetheless, we have to perform the division by the &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; coordinates (as always for projective texture mapping); either by explicitly dividing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; or by using &lt;code&gt;texture2DProj&lt;/code&gt;: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
Shader &quot;GLSL projector shader for adding light&quot; {
   Properties {
      _ShadowTex (&quot;Projected Image&quot;, 2D) = &quot;white&quot; {}
   }
   SubShader {
      Pass {      
         Blend One One 
            // add color of _ShadowTex to the color in the framebuffer 
 
         GLSLPROGRAM

         // User-specified properties
         uniform sampler2D _ShadowTex; 

         // Projector-specific uniforms
         uniform mat4 _Projector; // transformation matrix 
            // from object space to projector space 
                  
         varying vec4 positionInProjSpace; 
            // position of the vertex (and fragment) in projector space

         #ifdef VERTEX

         void main()
         {                                         
            positionInProjSpace = _Projector * gl_Vertex;            
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }

         #endif

         #ifdef FRAGMENT

         void main()
         {
            if (positionInProjSpace.w &gt; 0.0) // in front of projector?
            {
               gl_FragColor = texture2D(_ShadowTex , 
                  vec2(positionInProjSpace) / positionInProjSpace.w); 
               // alternatively: gl_FragColor = texture2DProj(  
               //    _ShadowTex, vec3(positionInProjSpace));
            }
            else // behind projector
            {
               gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0);
            }
         }

         #endif
         
         ENDGLSL
      }
   }  
   // The definition of a fallback shader should be commented out 
   // during development:
   // Fallback &quot;Projector/Light&quot;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Notice that we have to test whether &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is positive (i.e. the fragment is in front of the projector, not behind it). Without this test, the projector would also add light to objects behind it. Furthermore, the texture image has to be square and it is usually a good idea to use textures with wrap mode set to clamp.

Just in case you wondered: the shader property for the texture is called &lt;code&gt;_ShadowTex&lt;/code&gt; in order to be compatible with the built-in shaders for projectors.

===Projectors for Modulating Colors===
The basic steps of creating a projector for modulating colors are the same as above. The only difference is the shader code. The following example adds a drop shadow by attenuating colors, in particular the floor's color. Note that in an actual application, the color of the shadow caster should not be attenuated. This can be achieved by assigning the shadow caster to a particular '''Layer''' (in the '''Inspector View''' of the game object) and specifying this layer under '''Ignore Layers''' in the '''Inspector View''' of the projector.

In order to give the shadow a certain shape, we use the alpha component of a texture image to determine how dark the shadow is. (Thus, we can use the cookie textures for lights in the standard assets.) In order to attenuate the color in the framebuffer, we should multiply it with 1 minus alpha (i.e. factor 0 for alpha equals 1). Therefore, the appropriate blend equation is:

&lt;code&gt;Blend Zero OneMinusSrcAlpha&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;Zero&lt;/code&gt; indicates that we don't add any light. Even if the shadow is too dark, no light should be added; instead, the alpha component should be reduced in the fragment shader, e.g. by multiplying it with a factor less than 1. For an independent modulation of the color components in the framebuffer, we would require &lt;code&gt;Blend Zero SrcColor&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Blend Zero OneMinusSrcColor&lt;/code&gt;.

The different blend equation is actually about the only change in the shader code compared to the version for adding light:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
Shader &quot;GLSL projector shader for drop shadows&quot; {
   Properties {
      _ShadowTex (&quot;Shadow Shape&quot;, 2D) = &quot;white&quot; {}
   }
   SubShader {
      Pass {      
         Blend Zero OneMinusSrcAlpha // attenuate color in framebuffer 
            // by 1 minus alpha of _ShadowTex
 
         GLSLPROGRAM

         // User-specified properties
         uniform sampler2D _ShadowTex; 

         // Projector-specific uniforms
         uniform mat4 _Projector; // transformation matrix 
            // from object space to projector space 
                  
         varying vec4 positionInProjSpace; 
            // position of the vertex (and fragment) in projector space

         #ifdef VERTEX

         void main()
         {                                         
            positionInProjSpace = _Projector * gl_Vertex;            
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }

         #endif

         #ifdef FRAGMENT

         void main()
         {
            if (positionInProjSpace.w &gt; 0.0) // in front of projector?
            {
               gl_FragColor = texture2D(_ShadowTex , 
                  vec2(positionInProjSpace) / positionInProjSpace.w); 
               // alternatively: gl_FragColor = texture2DProj(
               //    _ShadowTex, vec3(positionInProjSpace));
            }
            else // behind projector
            {
               gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0);
            }
         }

         #endif
         
         ENDGLSL
      }
   }  
   // The definition of a fallback shader should be commented out 
   // during development:
   // Fallback &quot;Projector/Light&quot;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h2&gt;Colors&lt;/h2&gt;
Always reset the :visited color when you reset the :link/default color of a link for consistent behavior between IE and standards-compliant browsers

Use three char styles as shorthand for hex color codes with repeating patterns (#FC0 = #FFCC00; #AAA = #AAAAAA)

&lt;h2&gt;Line Height&lt;/h2&gt;
The difference between the line-height and font-size is called leading

The baseline is an invisible line onto which all type characters sit

Descenders are lowercase letters that hang below the baseline, including j, g, y, and p. 

Baseline shift involves moving characters up or down in relation to the baseline to align entities, bullets, brackets, numbers and other font-based graphics with letters

Use relative positioning and minor top and bottom movements to implement baseline shifting with CSS

(font-size + vertical padding + vertical margin)/line-height for each element must be a multiple of a baseline number

(font-size + vertical padding + vertical margin) * line-height gives you the total height of each row of text

The leading for inline replaced elements(img, object, select, etc) in IE6 collapses the half-leading of the line with the half-leading of the preceding and following line. To workaround this, give the replaced element top and bottom margins equal to half of the difference between its height and the line-height

Inline text needs the same font-size, line-height, vertical alignment, padding, border, margins and position values to line up consistently across browsers

Use line-height to emulate height and padding to emulate width/2 for inline elements

Set generous bottom margins for paragraph tags globally for create consistent and maintainable leading standards

Set vertical margins equal to the global line-height to maintain vertical alignment for text with standard size fonts. For text equal to the line height, set vertical margins and line-height equal to 100% of the text height

Use multiple fonts in one line, such as &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Hi&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; to override line-height and reset it relative to the largest font-size

Set uniform left and right padding for container divs to create consistent and maintainable gutter standards

Set wider left margins for list items and quoted text to facilitate hanging punctuation

Specify the line height to be the same as the height of the box to align text vertically

If line-height is specified as a floating point number instead of a fixed unit, the inherited line-height of child elements will be the font-size of the child element multiplied by the number

If line-height is specified as a relative unit, the inherited line-height will be the same as that of the parent element

Use a font with a color matching the background and a font size larger than the line-height to maintain a vertical consistency for text which does not match the flow of the page

&lt;h2&gt;Font Size&lt;/h2&gt;
The top and bottom margins between the font-size and the line box are half-leading, so a 12px font-size on a 18px line will half 3 pixels of space on the top and bottom between the text and the next line

Divide the font-size of an element by that of its container to convert it to ems. Multiply by 100 to convert that to percentages

Divide the width of a comp layout by the default browser font size of 16px to get the min or max width in ems. Multiply by 100 to convert that to percentages.

Use percentages for all fonts to allow for browser selectable sizing

Use a wrapper with the desired font-size when setting margins, letter-spacing, or text-spacing in IE7, since the font-size of the parent element is used to compute the relative property values instead of font-size of the element itself

&lt;h2&gt;Font Family&lt;/h2&gt;
Never use carriage returns within font-family lists since it won't work in IE

Use font-family:monospace to style pre-tags in Opera

&lt;h2&gt;Vertical-Align&lt;/h2&gt;
Define font-size and the corresponding line-height to set a vertical rhythm

Use offsetting values for vertical-align and line-height, such as { vertical-align: 10px; line-height: -10px }  to emulate vertical padding for inline elements

Use overflow:hidden on elements with display:inline-block to change their baseline for vertical alignment

Use a pixel value for line-height to reposition input elements cross-browser

&lt;h2&gt;List-Style&lt;/h2&gt;
Use direction: rtl; on the ul or ol to right align bullet points next to a list item. If there are spacing issues, use a bullet background-image with background-position:right center as an alternative

Use display:list-item and list-style-type:decimal to enumerate an element that is not semantically part of a list

Use list-style-type:decimal to enumerate an unordered list when you cannot modify the markup

Use a margin reset on ordered list with hasLayout and add margins to the list items to prevent the enumeration from being cropped

&lt;h2&gt;Text-Decoration&lt;/h2&gt;
Use text-decoration:none and list-style-type:none to remove bullets and underlines from links and lists respectively.

Use text-decoration:line-through instead of the deprecated &amp;lt;s&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;strike&amp;gt; tags to strikethrough text

&lt;h2&gt;Text-Transform&lt;/h2&gt;
Use text-transform:capitalize to capitalize headers and section titles

&lt;h2&gt;Text-Indent&lt;/h2&gt;
Use &lt;dfn&gt;text-indent: 0&lt;/dfn&gt; on elements with &lt;dfn&gt;display:inline-block&lt;/dfn&gt; to avoid inheritance and has Layout issues since IE6 crops text moved outside the container due to negative text-indent values

Use text-indent and text-align on block elements to affect their children, and vertical-align on the children themselves

Use a negative value for text-indent to create an outdent for hanging punctuation

Use text-indent to reposition inline-blocks in Webkit, but use horizontal margins if cross-browser compatibility is necessary

&lt;h2&gt;Text-Overflow&lt;/h2&gt;
Use text-overflow to truncate text inside fixed width/height containers with overflow visible

&lt;h2&gt;White-Space&lt;/h2&gt;
Use white-space:pre with a return after each letter to display text that reads vertically

Use white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; for Firefox 2, word-wrap: break-word; and white-space:pre; for IE6/7, the pre tag for Safari 2 and white-space: pre-wrap for Opera, Safari 3, and Firefox 3 and to force wrapping on predefined text

Use white-space: pre; on a span with a single carriage return or its entity equivalent (&amp;#13;) instead of two br tags to add a space between two inline sentences. Use conditional comments to insert another span that has a word-wrap:pre rule around the paragraph preceding the one with the predefined spacing to achieve consistent display in IE6/7

&lt;h2&gt;Word-Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
Use margins and the &amp;lt;wbr&amp;gt; tag (or its [http://www.quirksmode.org/oddsandends/wbr.html equivalents]) to control wrapping and vertical alignment of list items and headers with long unbroken strings when overflow:hidden is not an option

Use the &amp;lt;wbr&amp;gt; tag or its entity equivalent in conditional comments &amp;lt;![if (!IE)]&amp;gt; &amp;#8203; &amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt; to insert a conditional carriage return that will wrap long words if necessary at the position where the tag is placed.  Use wbr:after { content: &quot;0200B&quot; } in CSS to insert the equivalent HTML entity for Opera and Safari, which do not recognize the &amp;lt;wbr&amp;gt; tag, in order to produce the effect on those browsers. Use word-wrap:break-word if Firefox 2, Safari 2, and Opera 9 are not supported.

&lt;h2&gt;Pseudo-Elements&lt;/h2&gt;
Use p:first-letter to set a large font and create a literature style drop cap effect for paragraphs

Use a:first-line to set a specific line-height for links that wrap

There can be only one pseudo-element per selector, so :first-letter and :first-line cannot be used together

In IE6 and IE7, a pseudo-element has to be followed by whitespace to be parsed correctly, so format your style sheet accordingly to avoid mysterious errors like this:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
P:first-letter{ color: blue; } /* Fails due to the lack of whitespace */

Succeed - P:first-letter { color: blue; } /* Note the added space */
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In IE6 and IE7, a pseudo-element has to be at the end of a selector to be parsed correctly, so make sure to put :first-line or :first-letter after any :hover, :focus, or :first-child pseudo-classes as follows:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
P:first-letter:hover { color: blue; } /* Fails due to the lack of whitespace */

P:hover:first-letter { color: blue; } /* Note the ordering */
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Generated Content&lt;/h2&gt;
Use CSS3 selectors, generated content, and Unicode values to dynamically surround content in blockquotes with quotation marks:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
 blockquote &amp;gt; *:first-child:before { content:&amp;quot;\201C&amp;quot;; }
 blockquote &amp;gt; *:last-child:after { content:&amp;quot;\201D&amp;quot;; }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Opacity&lt;/h2&gt;
Text in Firefox 3 Mac with opacity set on it looks messed up, and text in Firefox 2 Mac with opacity set has reduced contrast

&lt;h2&gt;Unicode Direction&lt;/h2&gt;
Use unicode-bidi:bidi-override; and direction:rtl; to create a left-handed scrollbar

&lt;h2&gt;Vertical Text&lt;/h2&gt;
Use the writing-mode property with a value of tb-rl value to rotate text 90 degrees clockwise and align it to the right in IE, and using the transform property with a value of rotate(90deg) in standards browsers

&lt;h2&gt;Pagination&lt;/h2&gt;
Use the widows and orphans properties to set the minimum lines of text displayed at the top and bottom of the page respectively when generating page breaks in CSS

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h2&gt;IE6/IE7 z-index Workarounds&lt;/h2&gt;
In IE7 and under, relatively and absolutely positioned elements have an automatic z-index of zero. In addition, IE evaluates a z-index of auto as a z-index of zero. Therefore, two absolutely positioned elements inside different containers cannot overlap. If one of the parent elements has a z-index of 1, then it's child can overlap the child of the other container. For dropdowns, raise the z-index of the currently hovered item instead of relying on the z-index of the menu itself.

Set descending z-index values on the each relatively positioned div starting from the outermost container so that the root div in the markup has the highest value and any absolutely positioned divs within have the lowest z-index values so they will not overlap static divs in IE6

Any relatively positioned element with haslayout establishes a stacking context. If two elements are both relatively positioned, and one is set to z-index:1, it will be hidden under the second div if they overlap in IE6/7.

To get a modal dialog box to overlap a select element in IE6, use a positive z-index value and overflow:hidden; for the absolutely positioned div. Then insert an empty iframe inside conditional comments as a child element of the absolutely positioned div and style it position:absolute; top:0; left:0; z-index:-1; filter:mask(); and a defined width and height. This works because a select element behind an iframe will not be drawn by IE6, even if it is invisible.

&lt;h2&gt;z-index Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
Every element whose z-index is specified as an integer or whose opacity is not equal to 100% establishes a new stacking context in which the element itself is the zero z-index for its child elements, and its children are positioned relative to each other but cannot overlap elements outside of the container.

If a relatively positioned element is display:inline, its left/right and top/bottom offsets are based on its container only instead of the stacking context

A z-index of auto means that the element does not create a z-index of zero for its children, so their z-index value is relative to the other elements on the page

If two or more sibling elements have the same stacking level within their parent, they are rendered back to front in the order of their appearance in the HTML markup.

If you want relatively positioned elements in one div to overlap relatively positioned elements in another div, you have to raise the z-index of the entire div, or combine the content into the one container div

If you want one element to paint on top of everything else, but you want a child of that element to be behind everything else, make that element the only relatively positioned element, then position the child with a negative z-index

If you want one border color to overlap another on adjacent table cells, give that cell a higher z-index than the other. Use a border width of zero with the higher z-index to erase the border completely.

An element that establishes a stacking context will overlap an adjacent floating element if they intersect

Elements with the same stacking context are displayed based on source order; tags added last overlap tags added first

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h2&gt;Syntax&lt;/h2&gt;
Use :: notation (double colon notation) for pseudo-elements(::first-line, ::first-letter, ::before, ::after, etc.) to distinguish them from pseudo-classes(:active, :hover, :focus, :link, :visited, :first-child, etc.). For compatibility with IE6/7, use single colon notation for both or IE specific styles.

&lt;h2&gt;Pseudo Clicks&lt;/h2&gt;
Use :active instead of onclick events and :hover instead of onmouseover events when no data needs to be passed

Use a border color which is equal to the background color as the default value then change it in the hover state to create a rollover effect without shifting the content. Decrease the desired padding by the size of the border to adjust for it always being hidden in the background instead of inserted and removed dynamically.

Use a:active, a:focus{outline:0;width:0;height:0;} to remove the dotted line around clicked links

Use :link,:visited to style links without styling named anchor tags

Add absolutely positioned elements within link tags and reference them in hover definitions(ex. A:hover span{...}) to create rollover dropdown menus without JavaScript

Use rel=&quot;external&quot; for all external links and a[rel~=&quot;external&quot;] { target-new: tab; } (CSS3 Attribute Selector) to open links in a new tab

&lt;h2&gt;Hit Detection&lt;/h2&gt;
Use cursor styles, transparent borders, and image maps to extend the click area of links to cover the dimensions of their parent elements without using JavaScript

If a container hasLayout(fixed width/height, inline-block,float), then block level anchors within will not have proper hit detection unless one of the links also includes a hasLayout trigger (zoom, inline-block, fixed height) for itself or a child element, or includes an image as a child element. hasLayout on the block level anchor itself
may cause margins to disappear, so avoid vertical margins in that situation

If a block level link is absolutely positioned over content, it will not have proper hit detection unless it has a defined background. You can make the background transparent or use opacity to make the content visible

Use &quot;ul &amp;gt; li{...}&quot; instead of &quot;ul li{...}&quot; to only target the first level children of a tag instead of all nested descendants(CSS2 Child Selector)

&lt;h2&gt;Element Targeting&lt;/h2&gt;
Use { target-name: modal; } (CSS3 Attribute Selector) to open links in a modal box

Use &quot;a[href=http://abcxyz]&quot; to target elements with specific attribute values(CSS2 Attribute Selector)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h2&gt;Clip Property Top/Left Coordinates&lt;/h2&gt;
The top and left parameters of the clip property remove any pixels with coordinates above or before the specified values, based on the top and left edges of the element. 

&lt;h2&gt;Clip Property Bottom/Right Coordinates&lt;/h2&gt;
* The bottom and right parameters remove any pixels located below or after the specified values, based on the top and left edges of the element. 
* The values for bottom and right must be higher than the values of top and left in order to see any of the layer. 

&lt;h2&gt;Clip Property Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
* The clipped element must be absolutely positioned for the clip property to work, so use a relatively positioned container around it. 
* Specifying the height of the container keeps the next line from overlapping with the clipped areas.

&lt;h2&gt;Clip Property Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
Use &lt;dfn&gt;clip: rect(0, auto, auto, 0);&lt;/dfn&gt; as the default clip values to do proper trial and error

Use &lt;dfn&gt;clip: rect(0, ###, auto, 0);&lt;/dfn&gt; to clip from left-to-right

Use &lt;dfn&gt;clip: rect(0, auto, ###, 0);&lt;/dfn&gt; to clip from top-to-bottom

&lt;h2&gt;Using the Clip Property to create a File Upload Button Replacement Solution&lt;h2&gt;
Use clipping, opacity and z-index to style file inputs by transparently positioning the field over an image:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
 input[type=&quot;file&quot;] { outline: none; cursor: pointer; position: absolute; left: 0; clip: rect(0px 215px 22px 145px); z-index: 2; opacity: 0; }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Use separate styles for Webkit browsers since the file input is rendered differently:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
* &gt; /**/ input[type=&quot;file&quot;], x:-webkit-any-link { outline: none; cursor: pointer; position: absolute; left: 0; clip: rect(0px 86px 22px 0px); z-index: 2; opacity: 0; }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Tea|Tea]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Germany|Cuisine of Germany]]

Afternoon tea is an important part of [[w:East Frisia|East Frisia]]n culture. Whether at home or when visiting friends, East Frisians try not to miss their ''[[w:de:Ostfriesische Teekultur|Teetied]]'' (Low German for &quot;tea time&quot;).

[[File:Kluntje.jpg|thumb|left|Pieces of rock sugar or ''Kluntjes'']]

==Ingredients==
*Boiling [[Cookbook:Water|water]], soft if possible; at least ½ liter (2 cups) per person
*Loose [[Cookbook:Tea|tea]] leaves, a strong black variety such as [[w:de:Ostfriesentee|Assam or Ceylon]]; about 2 tablespoons per liter (or quart) plus 1 more teaspoon &quot;for the pot&quot;.
*[[Cookbook:Rock Sugar|Rock sugar]], locally called ''Kluntjes''; 1 piece per person
*[[Cookbook:Cream|Cream]]; 1 teaspoon per serving

==Procedure==
[[File:Tee sahneloeffel.jpg|thumb|A cream spoon]]
#Rinse out the teapot with boiling water to warm it. Pour the water out, then add the tea leaves.
#Fill the pot halfway with water that has cooled slightly from the boiling point.
#Put the lid on the teapot and allow the tea to steep for three to four minutes.
#Add the rest of the water.
#Place one piece of rock sugar into each cup.
#Pour the tea through a strainer into the cups. The rock sugar will start to crackle in the hot liquid.
#Using a cream spoon (shaped like a teaspoon-sized [[Cookbook:ladle|ladle]]) or teaspoon, gently lower a spoonful of cream into the tea so that it forms a &quot;cloud&quot;. Do ''not'' stir the tea.

The tea is ''not'' stirred. Rather, enjoy the different flavors at the different layers: the relatively &quot;pure&quot; black tea at the top, the tea mixed with cream in the middle, and the tea sweetened by the rock sugar at the bottom.

The same piece of rock sugar can be used for the next cups of tea. It is considered impolite in East Frisia for a guest to drink fewer than three cups.

[[Cookbook:Cookie|Cookie]]s (biscuits) may be served with the tea. Rum is occasionally added to the tea for warmth on colder days.

      <comment>/* GROUP C: Frank with double straight-line outer border and no inner panels */ --~~~~</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Iceland=

&lt;font size=3 &gt;The first Iceland meters were used in 1929. All Icelandic meter stamps have “ÍSLAND” in the frank.

The stamps are grouped according to appearance:
* A - Single straight-line frank with panels at top and bottom
* B - Horizontal frank with straight-line ornaments at sides
* C - Double straight-line frank without inner panels
* PO – Generated by machines in Post Offices


For specialized information about the meter stamps of Iceland, see &lt;i&gt;Icelandic Meters 1930 – 1993&lt;/i&gt;  by Thor Thorsteins, self-published, Reykjavik, 1994.
&lt;/font&gt;

[[File:Cloud_Gate_Chicago.jpg|250px|thumb|left|An example of a reflecting surface: the “Cloud Gate” sculpture in Chicago.]]

This tutorial introduces '''reflection mapping''' (and '''cube maps''' to implement it).

It's the first in a small series of tutorials about environment mapping using cube maps in Unity. The tutorial is based on the per-pixel lighting described in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Smooth Specular Highlights}} and on the concept of texture mapping, which was introduced in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Textured Spheres}}.

[[File:Cube mapped reflection example.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A skybox is a (infinitely) large box surrounding the whole scene. Here a reflected camera ray (i.e. view ray) hits one of the textured faces of the skybox.]]
===Reflection Mapping with a Skybox===
The illustration {{Hide in print|to the left}}{{Only in print|below}} depicts the concept of reflection mapping with a static skybox: a view ray is reflected at a point on the surface of an object and the reflected ray is intersected with the skybox to determine the color of the corresponding pixel. The skybox is just a large cube with textured faces surrounding the whole scene. It should be noted that skyboxes are usually static and don't include any dynamic objects of the scene. However, “skyboxes” for reflection mapping are often rendered to include the scene from a certain point of view. This is, however, beyond the scope of this tutorial.

Moreover, this tutorial covers only the computation of the reflection, it doesn't cover the rendering of the skybox, which is discussed in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Skyboxes}}. For the reflection of a skybox in an object, we have to render the object and reflect the rays from the camera to the surface points at the surface normal vectors. The mathematics of this reflection is the same as for the reflection of a light ray at a surface normal vector, which was discussed in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Specular Highlights}}. 

Once we have the reflected ray, its intersection with a large skybox has to be computed. This computation actually becomes easier if the skybox is infinitely large: in that case the position of the surface point doesn't matter at all since its distance from the origin of the coordinate system is infinitely small compared to the size of the skybox; thus, only the direction of the reflected ray matters but not its position. Therefore, we can actually also think of a ray that starts in the center of a small skybox instead of a ray that starts somewhere in an infinitely large skybox. (If you are not familiar with this idea, you probably need a bit of time to accept it.) Depending on the direction of the reflected ray, it will intersect one of the six faces of the textured skybox. We could compute, which face is intersected and where the face is intersected and then do a texture lookup (see {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Textured Spheres}}) in the texture image for the specific face. However, GLSL offers cube maps, which support exactly this kind of texture lookups in the six faces of a cube using a direction vector. Thus, all we need to do, is to provide a cube map for the environment as a shader property and use the &lt;code&gt;textureCube&lt;/code&gt; instruction with the reflected direction to get the color at the corresponding position in the cube map. 

{{clear}}
===Cube Maps===
A cube map shader property called &lt;code&gt;_Cube&lt;/code&gt; can be defined this way in a Unity shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
   Properties {
      _Cube (&quot;Reflection Map&quot;, Cube) = &quot;&quot; {}
   }
&lt;/source&gt;
The corresponding uniform variable is defined this way in a GLSL shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            uniform samplerCube _Cube;	
&lt;/source&gt;

To create a cube map, select '''Create &gt; Cubemap''' in the '''Project View'''. Then you have to specify six texture images for the faces of the cube in the '''Inspector View'''. Examples for such textures can be found in '''Standard Assets &gt; Skyboxes &gt; Textures'''. Furthermore, you should check '''MipMaps''' in the '''Inspector View''' for the cube map; this should produce considerably better visual results for reflection mapping.

The vertex shader has to compute the view direction &lt;code&gt;viewDirection&lt;/code&gt; and the normal direction &lt;code&gt;normalDirection&lt;/code&gt; as discussed in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Specular Highlights}}. To reflect the view direction in the fragment shader, we can use the GLSL function &lt;code&gt;reflect&lt;/code&gt; as also discussed in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Specular Highlights}}:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            vec3 reflectedDirection = 
               reflect(viewDirection, normalize(normalDirection));
&lt;/source&gt;
And to perform the texture lookup in the cube map and store the resulting color in the fragment color, we simply use:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            gl_FragColor = textureCube(_Cube, reflectedDirection);
&lt;/source&gt;
That's about it.

===Complete Shader Code===
The shader code then becomes:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
Shader &quot;GLSL shader with reflection map&quot; {
   Properties {
      _Cube(&quot;Reflection Map&quot;, Cube) = &quot;&quot; {}
   }
   SubShader {
      Pass {   
         GLSLPROGRAM

         // User-specified uniforms
         uniform samplerCube _Cube;   

         // The following built-in uniforms
         // are also defined in &quot;UnityCG.glslinc&quot;, 
         // i.e. one could #include &quot;UnityCG.glslinc&quot; 
         uniform vec3 _WorldSpaceCameraPos; 
            // camera position in world space
         uniform mat4 _Object2World; // model matrix
         uniform mat4 _World2Object; // inverse model matrix

         // Varyings         
         varying vec3 normalDirection;
         varying vec3 viewDirection;
         
         #ifdef VERTEX
         
         void main()
         {            
            mat4 modelMatrix = _Object2World;
            mat4 modelMatrixInverse = _World2Object; // unity_Scale.w 
               // is unnecessary because we normalize vectors
            
            normalDirection = normalize(vec3(
               vec4(gl_Normal, 0.0) * modelMatrixInverse));
            viewDirection = vec3(modelMatrix * gl_Vertex 
               - vec4(_WorldSpaceCameraPos, 1.0));
            
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
         
         #endif


         #ifdef FRAGMENT
         
         void main()
         {
            vec3 reflectedDirection = 
               reflect(viewDirection, normalize(normalDirection));
            gl_FragColor = textureCube(_Cube, reflectedDirection);
         }

         #endif

         ENDGLSL
      }
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Approaching A New Code Base ===
* Start with the acceptance tests to understand the features
* Checkout the build file. Run the build to check the health of it
* Sketch class diagrams (or reverse engineer from code)
* Look at the main domain objects and what they do
* Take a '''vertical slice'''. Select a main feature and see how it works from the front to back end.
* Look at the source code repository, specifically at files that have changed the most. Checkout the log messages as well

[[File:Subway lights in tunnel.JPG|250px|thumb|left|Multiple subway lights of limited range in a tunnel.]]
This tutorial covers '''lighting by multiple light sources in one pass'''. In particular, it covers Unity's so-called “vertex lights” in the &lt;code&gt;ForwardBase&lt;/code&gt; pass.

This tutorial is an extension of {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Smooth Specular Highlights}}. If you haven't read that tutorial, you should read it first.

===Multiple Lights in One Pass===
As discussed in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Diffuse Reflection}}, Unity's forward rendering path uses separate passes for the most important light sources. These are called “pixel lights” because the built-in shaders render them with per-pixel lighting. All light sources with the '''Render Mode''' set to '''Important''' are rendered as pixel lights. If the '''Pixel Light Count''' of the '''Quality''' project settings allows for more pixel lights, then some of the light sources with '''Render Mode''' set to '''Auto''' are also rendered as pixel lights. What happens to the other light sources? The built-in shaders of Unity render four additional lights as '''vertex lights''' in the &lt;code&gt;ForwardBase&lt;/code&gt; pass. As the name indicates, the built-in shaders render these lights with per-vertex lighting. This is what this tutorial is about. (Further lights are approximated by spherical harmonic lighting, which is not covered here.)

Unfortunately, it is somewhat unclear how to access the four vertex lights (i.e. their positions and colors). Here is, what appears to work in Unity 3.4 on Windows and MacOS X: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
   // Built-in uniforms for &quot;vertex lights&quot;
   uniform vec4 unity_LightColor[4];
      // array of the colors of the 4 light sources 
   uniform vec4 unity_4LightPosX0; 
      // x coordinates of the 4 light sources in world space
   uniform vec4 unity_4LightPosY0; 
      // y coordinates of the 4 light sources in world space
   uniform vec4 unity_4LightPosZ0; 
      // z coordinates of the 4 light sources in world space
   uniform vec4 unity_4LightAtten0; 
      // scale factors for attenuation with squared distance
   // uniform vec4 unity_LightPosition[4] is apparently not 
   // always correctly set in Unity 3.4
   // uniform vec4 unity_LightAtten[4] is apparently not 
   // always correctly set in Unity 3.4
&lt;/source&gt;
Depending on your platform and version of Unity you might have to use &lt;code&gt;unity_LightPosition[4]&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;unity_4LightPosX0&lt;/code&gt;,  &lt;code&gt;unity_4LightPosY0&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;unity_4LightPosZ0&lt;/code&gt;. Similarly, you might have to use &lt;code&gt;unity_LightAtten[4]&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;unity_4LightAtten0&lt;/code&gt;. Note what's not available: neither any cookie texture nor the transformation to light space (and therefore neither the direction of spotlights). Also, no 4th component of the light positions is available; thus, it is unclear whether a vertex light is a directional light, a point light, or a spotlight.

Here, we follow Unity's built-in shaders and only compute the diffuse reflection by vertex lights using per-vertex lighting. This can be computed with the following for-loop inside the vertex shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            vertexLighting = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
            for (int index = 0; index &lt; 4; index++)
            {    
               vec4 lightPosition = vec4(unity_4LightPosX0[index], 
                  unity_4LightPosY0[index], 
                  unity_4LightPosZ0[index], 1.0);
 
               vec3 vertexToLightSource = 
                   vec3(lightPosition - position);        
               vec3 lightDirection = normalize(vertexToLightSource);
               float squaredDistance = 
                  dot(vertexToLightSource, vertexToLightSource);
               float attenuation = 1.0 / (1.0  + 
                   unity_4LightAtten0[index] * squaredDistance);
               vec3 diffuseReflection = 
                  attenuation * vec3(unity_LightColor[index]) 
                  * vec3(_Color) * max(0.0, 
                  dot(varyingNormalDirection, lightDirection));         
 
               vertexLighting = vertexLighting + diffuseReflection;
            }
&lt;/source&gt;
The total diffuse lighting by all vertex lights is accumulated in &lt;code&gt;vertexLighting&lt;/code&gt; by initializing it to black and then adding the diffuse reflection of each vertex light to the previous value of &lt;code&gt;vertexLighting&lt;/code&gt; at the end of the for-loop. A for-loop should be familiar to any C/C++/Java/JavaScript programmer. Note that for-loops are sometimes severely limited; in particular the limits (here: 0 and 4) have to be constants in Unity, i.e. you cannot even use uniforms to determine the limits. (The technical reason is that the limits have to be known at compile time in order to “un-roll” the loop.) 

This is more or less how vertex lights are computed in Unity's built-in shaders. However, remember that nothing would stop you from computing specular reflection or per-pixel lighting with these “vertex lights”.

===Complete Shader Code===
In the context of the shader code from {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Smooth Specular Highlights}}, the complete shader code is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
Shader &quot;GLSL per-pixel lighting with vertex lights&quot; {
   Properties {
      _Color (&quot;Diffuse Material Color&quot;, Color) = (1,1,1,1) 
      _SpecColor (&quot;Specular Material Color&quot;, Color) = (1,1,1,1) 
      _Shininess (&quot;Shininess&quot;, Float) = 10
   }
   SubShader {
      Pass {      
         Tags { &quot;LightMode&quot; = &quot;ForwardBase&quot; } // pass for 
            // 4 vertex lights, ambient light &amp; first pixel light

         // The following built-in uniforms (except _LightColor0) 
         // are also defined in &quot;UnityCG.glslinc&quot;, 
         // i.e. one could #include &quot;UnityCG.glslinc&quot; 
         uniform vec3 _WorldSpaceCameraPos;

         ENDGLSL
      }
   } 
   // The definition of a fallback shader should be commented out 
   // during development:
   // Fallback &quot;Specular&quot;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
The use of &lt;code&gt;#pragma multi_compile_fwdbase&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;#ifdef VERTEXLIGHT_ON ... #endif&lt;/code&gt; appears to be necessary to make sure that no vertex lighting is computed when Unity doesn't provide the data.

===Summary===
Congratulations, you have reached the end of this tutorial. We have seen:
*How Unity's vertex lights are specified.
*How a for-loop can be used in GLSL to compute the lighting of multiple lights in one pass.

===Further Reading===
If you still want to know more 
* about other parts of the shader code, you should read {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Smooth Specular Highlights}}.
* about Unity's forward rendering path and what is computed in the &lt;code&gt;ForwardBase&lt;/code&gt; pass, you should read [http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/Components/RenderTech-ForwardRendering.html Unity's reference about forward rendering].

[[File:Quartz ball.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Crystal balls are examples of curved, transparent surfaces.]]
This tutorial covers '''refraction mapping''' and its implementation with cube maps.

It is a variation of {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Reflecting Surfaces}}, which should be read first.

===Refraction Mapping===
In {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Reflecting Surfaces}}, we reflected view rays and then performed texture lookups in a cube map in the reflected direction. Here, we refract view rays at a curved, transparent surface and then perform the lookups with the refracted direction. The effect will ignore the second refraction when the ray leaves the transparent object again; however, many people hardly notice the differences since such refractions are usually not part of our daily life. 
{{clear}}

Instead of the &lt;code&gt;reflect&lt;/code&gt; function, we are using the &lt;code&gt;refract&lt;/code&gt; function; thus, the fragment shader could be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         #ifdef FRAGMENT
 
         void main()
         {
            float refractiveIndex = 1.5;
            vec3 refractedDirection = refract(normalize(viewDirection), 
               normalize(normalDirection), 1.0 / refractiveIndex);
            gl_FragColor = textureCube(_Cube, refractedDirection);
         }
 
         #endif
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that &lt;code&gt;refract&lt;/code&gt; takes a third argument, which is the refractive index of the outside medium (e.g. 1.0 for air) divided by the refractive index of the object (e.g. 1.5 for some kinds of glass). Also note that the first argument has to be normalized, which isn't necessary for &lt;code&gt;reflect&lt;/code&gt;.

===Complete Shader Code===
With the adapted fragment shader, the complete shader code becomes:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
Shader &quot;GLSL shader with refraction mapping&quot; {
   Properties {
      _Cube (&quot;Environment Map&quot;, Cube) = &quot;&quot; {}
   }
   SubShader {
      Pass {   
         GLSLPROGRAM

         // User-specified uniforms
         uniform samplerCube _Cube;   

         // The following built-in uniforms  
         // are also defined in &quot;UnityCG.glslinc&quot;, 
         // i.e. one could #include &quot;UnityCG.glslinc&quot; 
         uniform vec3 _WorldSpaceCameraPos; 
            // camera position in world space
         uniform mat4 _Object2World; // model matrix
         uniform mat4 _World2Object; // inverse model matrix

         // Varyings         
         varying vec3 normalDirection;
         varying vec3 viewDirection;
         
         #ifdef VERTEX
         
         void main()
         {            
            mat4 modelMatrix = _Object2World;
            mat4 modelMatrixInverse = _World2Object; // unity_Scale.w 
               // is unnecessary because we normalize vectors
            
            normalDirection = normalize(vec3(
               vec4(gl_Normal, 0.0) * modelMatrixInverse));
            viewDirection = vec3(modelMatrix * gl_Vertex 
               - vec4(_WorldSpaceCameraPos, 1.0));
            
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
         
         #endif


         #ifdef FRAGMENT
 
         void main()
         {
            float refractiveIndex = 1.5;
            vec3 refractedDirection = refract(normalize(viewDirection), 
               normalize(normalDirection), 1.0 / refractiveIndex);
            gl_FragColor = textureCube(_Cube, refractedDirection);
         }
 
         #endif

         ENDGLSL
      }
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== What Is Podcasting? ==

A podcast is a derivative of the words [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod iPod] and broadcasting.  It is a series of audio or video files that are often downloaded using Really Simple Syndication ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS RSS]) feeds.&lt;ref&gt; Retrieved July 31, 2011 from http://www.practicalmoneyskills.com/resources/faq.php &lt;/ref&gt;   Such feeds allow the listener/viewer to receive up-to-date information regarding his/her favorite Web site on a recurring basis. New files can be downloaded automatically and stored on the user's computer, iPod, or other [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_media_player portable media player] for offline use.&lt;ref&gt; Retrieved July 31, 2011 from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast &lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate surrounding the origins of podcasting.  &quot;Generally, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer Dave Winer], a software developer and an author of the RSS format, and former MTV VJ [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curry Adam Curry] are recognized as the originating force behind the podcasting phenomenon.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt; Ovadia, M. (2010). Retrieved August 1, 2011 from http://poducateme.com/guide/index11.php
&lt;/ref&gt;
Podcasts are not regulated by the government. The Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) broadcast decency regulations do not apply to podcasts. Therefore, when choosing to use a podcast for educational purposes, the instructor must screen the content.
Copyright law, however, does apply to podcasts. Creative Commons is one resource which can be used to copyright material. The user can choose from six different levels of licensing for the podcast.
A form of podcast is the video podcast, called a vidcast or vodcast. Instead of just an audiofile, the podcast contains video and can be created with a video camera, and video editing software. There are several free and low cost versions of software available, including Ezvid, VideoPad Video Editor, and Corel VideoStudio Pro [amazon link]. Additionally, the vodcast creator must use a video encoder to format it in a manageable file size for online viewing and find a video host.  The benefits of using a vidcast rather than a podcast are numerous including appeal to visual learners, ability of the student to see a process being taught, and teaching more advanced 21st Century skills through the editing program.&lt;ref&gt; Retrieved March 1, 2013 from http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/podcasting1.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

== What Are Its Benefits? ==

=== Universal ===
Podcasts are equivalent to talk radio without live streaming.  Information can be prepared and edited prior to being shared.  Podcasters have time on their side with regard to preparing and sharing information.  They can podcast according to their own schedule while bearing in mind that subscribers will expect the frequency that has been pre-established.  They can disseminate relevant information to a target audience from the comforts of their home or office.  Podcasts can also benefit the user.  Aside from most podcasts being free of charge, the information is accessible anytime and anyplace.  Oftentimes it is condensed so that key points are highlighted.  Subscribers can enjoy the benefits of having the information come to them regularly via RSS feeds.

===Academic===
Teachers as podcasters can ensure that content is delivered in a succinct and engaging manner.  Student absenteesim becomes less of an issue when podcasts are available to revisit content.  Questions that were not raised in class due to shyness or time constraints could very well be answered by way of podcasts.  Struggling or unmotivated readers can be better reached since the information is being presented in a user-friendly format.  Parents can be made aware of specific lessons, which may enable them to help their son/daughter with assignments. Some educators are concerned that the availability of podcasts gives students less of an incentive to physically attend class. However, research has shown that student attendance is not significantly lower for classes in which instruction and supplemental podcasts are available.&lt;ref&gt;Hew, K. F. (2009) http://emmerson.csc.wilkes.edu:2053/10.1007/s11423-008-9108-3 accessed August 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Students as podcasters allows them to become actively engaged in their learning. In order to demonstrate mastery of a concept, students can create a podcast that contains an instructional lecture on a topic that is meant to used by future students in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;Hew, K. F. (2009) http://emmerson.csc.wilkes.edu:2053/10.1007/s11423-008-9108-3 accessed August 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This also allows an instructor to build a large library of educational podcasts in far less time than it would take if the instructor were recording each episode by him or herself.  This [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(learning_theory)#Constructivist_theory constructivist] approach is known to yield long-lasting results.  Podcasts are also being used in some medical school curricula, and gives students a way to &quot;read&quot; or review texts from books or lectures while walking or driving to class.  Podcasts can be a significant aid for auditory learners.&lt;ref&gt;Boulos, M, Inocencio Maramba, and Steve Wheeler. (2006) http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6920/6/41/?ref=nf accessed August 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Creating podcasts in the classroom can also have many benefits for the students.  Knowing that they can potentially have a large audience, students will feel like they have a purpose and be intrinsically motivated to produce a good product.  This can be very valuable. &lt;ref&gt;Vincent, T. (n.d.)http://learninginhand.com/podcasting/ accessed August 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Getting Started ==
=== Hardware ===
At the very least, every podcaster needs a computer, a microphone, and a broadband Internet connection.
&lt;ref&gt; Orden, J., V. (2008). Retrieved August 1, 2011 from http://www.how-to-podcast-tutorial.com/seven-reasons-to-create-your-own-podcast.htm &lt;/ref&gt; Choosing the right microphone is key.  There are two types to consider: unidirectional and omnidirectional.  A unidirectional microphone is beneficial when there is only one speaker and background noise must be filtered. An omnidirectional microphone is helpful during multi-speaker podcasts or &quot;soundseeing&quot; tours. &lt;ref&gt; Affleck, A., W. (2008, October 6). Retrieved August 1, 2011 from http://www.macworld.com/article/135846/2008/10/podcasting_equipment.html
&lt;/ref&gt; For advanced podcasters, a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_box breakout box] or a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_console mixer] is worth considering. 
&quot;A breakout box—or external interface—puts audio-in and audio-out jacks for your computer in a convenient form factor—a separate box—which keeps you from messing with the back of your computer when you want to plug or unplug audio gear. Like a breakout box, an external mixer provides inputs and output jacks, but it also allows you to manage multiple input devices, control each device’s volume and equalizer settings, and combine the sources in a single stereo (or mono) signal.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Affleck, A., W. (2008, October 6). Retrieved August 1, 2011 from http://www.macworld.com/article/135846/2008/10/podcasting_equipment.html

=== Software ===

The basic software mentioned below is free to download and free to use. First, a program such as Audacity is needed to record and/or edit audio. Before uploading your file to a blog or other location on the internet, it is necessary to convert the file to MP3 format. This can be done via iTunes. Next, software such as iTunes is required to listen to your audio. The final necessity is software that will allow the user to upload the file to the internet.

=== Ideas for Podcasting in the Classroom ===

Podcasting is a way of easily distributing a series of audio or video files on the internet. (it can also be used to distribute PDF documents.) How can you use podcasting in Education? On this site you will find a few idea, but these are just a few ideas for podcasting in the classroom. Really any activity that involves oral presentation can probably be adapted to create a podcast series.

For ideas on instructional uses of podcasting, click on the project names on the left. For more information about creating a podcast, read on!

You may have already used audio and video in your class. Is that podcasting? Almost, but technically, no. For an audio or video file to be a podcast, two things have to happen. First, the file has to be online. That means it’s stored on a publicly-addressable server. It could be stored on your school’s server, or you could purchase server space through a number of services. Second, your file needs to be available as part of a subscription. The second step can be a little more complicated, but luckily there are many free services that will help you create the subscription file.

Listed below, you will find several resources that you might find helpful on the technical aspects of creating a podcast. Remember that there are many, many ways of creating and publishing a podcast using different programs, services, and tools. Look at several to find one with which you are comfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Ideas for Podcasting in the Classroom http://fcit.usf.edu/podcasts/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Virtual Field Trips ==


Virtual field trips provide opportunities for teachers and students to make personalized connections with the curriculum through an online learning environment.  Through the use of technology students can be motivated and gain interest in new content areas.  The internet provides a wealth of virtual field trips all over the world for all grade levels, providing experiences that would otherwise not be available to many students.   Many virtual field trips come with a price tag and many teaching resources, however several free or open source virtual field trips are available on the web.  &lt;ref&gt;Beal, C, &amp; Mason, C. (1999).  Virtual fieldtripping: no permission notes needed creating a middle school classroom without walls. Meridian, 2(1), Retrieved from http://www.ncsu.edu/meridian/jan99/vfieldtrip/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands of virtual field trips can be accessed via the web that have been created by students, teachers, and parents.  Virtual field trips offer a variety from photo tours of locations too far or too expensive for teachers to take their students to highly interactive video and audio field trips.  &lt;ref&gt;Steele-Carlin, S. (2006). Virtual field trips allows students to get outta the class without leaving their seats. Education World, Retrieved from http://www.educationworld.com/a_tech/tech/tech071.shtml &lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Virtual Field Trips ==



 
There are two types of virtual field trips on the web, ''packaged or pre-developed virtual field trips'', and ''teacher created or personalized virtual field trips''.Pre-developed or packaged virtual field trips are usually organized into three basic types: commercial; informational; and educational. &lt;ref&gt;Mandel, S. Why Use Virtual Field  Trips?  Retrieved June 2013  from http://www.phschool.com/eteach/professional_development/virtual_field_trips/essay.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Commercial sites want to sell something to the visitor. The visitor will be directed to other sites advertising merchandise and or a real excursion to the virtual destination, such as a vacation spot. Informational sites are often designed to promote and educate the public about a cause. For instance visitors to a nature preserve like the rain forest might hear a particular point of view like the mission statement of the organization. Educational sites are those created by teachers or students as part of a personal project or unit and are available for online use. These types of virtual field trips may or may not be useful. Advantages of packaged virtual field trips are that a wide array of subjects and age levels are available and it is convenient having sites ready to go. Pre-made sites may have websites that disappear or are under construction, and graphics may be slow to load.&lt;ref&gt;Tuthill, G., &amp; E.B. Klemm. 2002. “Virtual Field Trips: Alternatives to Actual Field Trips.” International Journal of Instructional Media 24 (4): 453–68.&lt;/ref&gt;. It might be hard to determine the technological level needed to be successful. &lt;ref&gt;Zanetis, J. 2010. “The Beginner’s Guide to Interactive Virtual Field Trips.” Learning &amp; Leading with Technology 37 (6): 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Another disadvantage is not being able to modify or edit the trips to ensure curricular goals and specific learner needs are met &lt;ref&gt;Kirchen, D. “Making and Taking Virtual Field Trips in Pre-K and the Primary Grades.” National Association for the Education of Young Children Journal 66 (6): 22-26. Retrieved June 2011 from  http://www.naeyc.org/files/yc/file/201111/Kirchen_Virtual_Field_Trips_Online%201111.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.
Teacher created or personalized virtual field trips are designed by the educator so can more easily meet the needs of individuals and groups as well as appropriate curricular goals and standards &lt;ref&gt;Zanetis, J. 2010. “The Beginner’s Guide to Interactive Virtual Field Trips.” Learning &amp; Leading with Technology 37 (6): 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt;. These virtual field trips give the teacher more control over audio, visual imagery, text, and the overall experience &lt;ref&gt;NAEYC &amp; Fred Rogers Center for Early Learning and Children’s Media.2011. “Technology in Early Childhood Programs Serving Children

[[File:Second Life Image.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Second Life Logo]]




Second Life is a virtual world which was launched on June 23, 2003. It allows residents of this virtual world to &quot;explore the world (known as the grid), meet other residents, socialize, participate in individual and group activities, and create and trade virtual property and services with one another&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Second life.&quot; Wikipedia. (2011). Retrieved from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_life&lt;/ref&gt; In Second Life (SL), users create avatars that represent themselves which can interact with other avatars, with objects, and their environments. In Second Life, each learner has the freedom to discover information relevant to his or her interests and to explore knowledge from the web through the &quot;teleport&quot; feature and the &quot;hyperlink&quot; feature. Learners have to become active participants rather than passive observers. The Second Life environment closely resembles the real world, thus allowing SL instructors to design authentic tasks whereby learners can explore the world, solve problems, construct and negotiate meaning, and collaborate with other learners. &lt;ref&gt;Wang, S., &amp; Hsu, H. (2009). Using the ADDIE Model to Design Second Life Activities for Online Learners. TechTrends: Linking Research &amp; Practice to Improve Learning, 53(6), 76-81. doi:10.1007/s11528-009-0347-x&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pros ==
There are many benefits to using Second Life in education. This includes:

1. Cost-effective

2. Improves communication

3. Encourages collaborative learning

4. Provides opportunities for synchronous learning activities for the home-schooler and cyber-schooler. Second Life boasts of being adopted by many colleges and universities around the world. 

5. Historical recreations, simulations, virtual field trips, and role-playing

6. Social/language interaction &lt;ref&gt;Linden Lab. (2011). Second life education: The virtual learning advantage. Retrieved from http://lecs-static-secondlife-com.s3.amazonaws.com/work/SL-Edu-Brochure-010411.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cons ==
Researchers also note several barriers that educators and students must get past in order for effective learning to take place.

1. Access - many secondary schools have blocked the use of Second Life within their district as a social networking site. Special permission must be granted before the download can take place.

2. Expertise to deal with technical issues

3. Online etiquette

4. Learning curve associated with learning the Second Life program

5. Protecting students through acquiring private land&lt;ref&gt;Carr, D. Oliver, M., &amp; Burn, A. (2010). Learning, Teaching and Ambiguity in Virtual Worlds. Retrieved from http://learningfromsocialworlds.wordpress.com/paper-for-relive-08-at-the-ou//&lt;/ref&gt;

== Machinima ==
is the use of real-time 3D computer graphics rendering engines to create a cinematic production. Most often, video games are used to generate the computer animation.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Machinima.&quot; Wikipedia. (2011). Retrieved from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinima&lt;/ref&gt;

Machinima can be used in education in many ways. &quot;Media educators, for instance, look to machinima as a creative, expressive form, with its own requisite skills and associated social and cultural practices. Others working with machinima production in educational contexts focus on the development of new applications, or the evolving relationship of machinima to the film or games industries. Others, meanwhile, are interested in machinima as a teaching tool; one that can be adapted to subject areas ranging from drama or film-making, to management training.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carr, D. (2007). &quot;Machinima in education.&quot; Future Lab. Retrieved from http://archive.futurelab.org.uk/resources/publications-reports-articles/web-articles/Web-Article794&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four common approaches to machinima.

1. Straight Recording - A screen recording program simply records whatever is going on within the screen to record the activities.

2. Puppetry Approach - Actions are recorded in real-time and saved for later editing.

3. Recamming -&quot;Builds on the puppet approach, and combines it with re-recording. Additional characters might be added, lighting changed, or cameras moved.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carr, D. (2007). &quot;Machinima in education.&quot; Future Lab. Retrieved from http://archive.futurelab.org.uk/resources/publications-reports-articles/web-articles/Web-Article794&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16PoZrwoPuM Click here to see an example of recamming machinima.]&lt;ref&gt;Rainey, S. (2011). &quot;Globe video.&quot; YouTube. Retrieved from http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16PoZrwoPuM&lt;/ref&gt;

4. Scripting - Programs are written to direct 3D characters to behave in a certain manner. This is the most complex of the four approaches to machinima and requires greater technical expertise. Scripting loses some of the &quot;in the moment&quot; feel of machinima but is more precise. &lt;ref&gt;Carr, D. (2007). &quot;Machinima in education.&quot; Future Lab. Retrieved from http://archive.futurelab.org.uk/resources/publications-reports-articles/web-articles/Web-Article794&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notecards ==
A notecard is an inventory item that is used for creating and/or sharing text and photos. For educational purposes, a notecard is a great way of sharing information that is too large to type in the chat forum. It is also good for giving directions or providing more information on a particular topic. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Notecards.&quot; Second Life Wiki. (2009). Retrieved from http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Notecards&lt;/ref&gt;

A notecard can be attached to any prim on the island, with proper permissions. For example, while exploring Genome Island, clicking on each lab experiment will equip the resident with a notecard that provides more information about what is going on in that experiment. The notecard often asks a question of the resident and provides directions for answering it.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, S &amp; Bell, M. (2011). Making Use of Notecards in Second Life. Retrieved from http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/making-use-of-notecards-in-second-life.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simulations ==


A simulation is a reproduction of contexts that can be too costly to reproduce in real life with the advantages that some physical constraints can be overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Warburton, S. (2009). Second Life in higher education: Assessing the potential for and the barriers to deploying virtual worlds in learning and teaching. British Journal of Educational Technology, 40(3), 414-426. doi:10.1111/j.1467-8535.2009.00952.x&lt;/ref&gt;  Simulations enable learners not only to see how a place looks, but also 'feel' what it is like being part of it. &lt;ref&gt;Salmon, G. (2009). The future for (second) life and learning. British Journal of Educational Technology, 40(3), 526-538. doi:10.1111/j.1467-8535.2009.00967.x&lt;/ref&gt; Second Life offers opportunities to simulate and replicate examples of cultural environments that are extinct or difficult to visit&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, G. (2009). The future for (second) life and learning. British Journal of Educational Technology, 40(3), 526-538. doi:10.1111/j.1467-8535.2009.00967.x&lt;/ref&gt; and gives users access to objects or phenomena impossible to observe or examine in real life. For example, the International Spaceflight Museum designed a series of simulation modules enabling users to play with scientific objects such as the lunar landing and solar system; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration built the Earth System Research Laboratory featuring a simulator with which users could experience tsunami waves and observe the process of glacial retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, S., &amp; Hsu, H. (2009). Using the ADDIE Model to Design Second Life Activities for Online Learners. TechTrends: Linking Research &amp; Practice to Improve Learning, 53(6), 76-81. doi:10.1007/s11528-009-0347-x&lt;/ref&gt;






== Displays and Exhibits ==
In Second life avatars can create displays and exhibits on a broad range of subject areas. Using images, text and multimedia they are able to create dynamic, interactive displays and exhibits which avatars can move in and interact with. Photography is also very easy. Pupils can take photos 'in-world' and send them for free to Flickr or SLPics to be displayed and commented on by others.&lt;ref&gt;.“Exploring the Potential of Second Life.&quot; Wikispaces. (2011). Retrieved from http://digitalkatie.wikispaces.com/How+to+use+SL&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digital Storytelling ==
Digitial storytelling is storytelling that incorporates digital images, video, music, and reflective narratives in order to share life experiences and personal insights. Students can create an experience or a space in which others can walk through their stories.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez, J. (2009). Pedagogical Applications of Second Life. Library Technology Reports, 45(2), 21-28. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt; Educators often identify the benefit of digital storytelling as the array of technical tools from which students may select for their creative expression. Learners set out to use these tools in new ways to make meaningful content. Students learn new software, choose images, edit video, make voiceover narration, add music, create title screens, and control flow and transitions. Additionally, there is opportunity to insert interactive features for “reader” participation. It is possible to click on imagery or text in order to choose what will happen next, cause an event to occur, or navigate to online content.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Digital Storytelling.&quot; Wikipedia. (2011). Retrieved from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_storytelling&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role Playing ==
Role-playing refers to the changing of one's behaviour to assume a role, either unconsciously to fill a social role, or consciously to act out an adopted role.&lt;ref&gt;“Role Playing.&quot; Wikipedia. (2011). Retrieved from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roleplaying&lt;/ref&gt; Role playing is an engaging teaching strategy that can be aided by the use of Second Life. In Second Life students can research their role model and create avatars resembling their role model. Role playing allows students to think beyond themselves and to understand issues by &quot;walking in someone else's shoes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez, J. (2009). Pedagogical Applications of Second Life. Library Technology Reports, 45(2), 21-28. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt; Educators can create fictional scenarios in Second Life which provide a safe environment where students can immerse themselves in a scenario that may not otherwise be available.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You can't become a great artist if you have to work all day. Thus, art in earlier periods reflects the interest of the upper classes. A secular monarch may pay portraits and stories about great wars or the life of his family, priests may pay for religious art, which might be restricted in form (e.g. no pictures of god).

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer since things work a little different here.
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Robin G.- Virtual field trip! What a wonderful idea for education. Geography and school policy are now longer limitations. Thanks for the ideas. One more example of the flat world.

Corley C.- Great job on the Virtual Field Trips wiki, Group 3.  With budget cuts the past few years, a lot of our field trips have been dropped.  With virtual field trips, it's almost like we can still go to get the educational purpose out of it.  Thanks for sharing!

I have added the description and the advantages and disadvantages of virtual field trips.  - Sadie [[User:Wilkes.moore|Wilkes.moore]] ([[User talk:Wilkes.moore|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wilkes.moore|contribs]]) 17:32, 1 August 2011 (UTC)

I added to the description and did the examples of virtual field trips and included the pics - even though I haven't figured out to place them. - Jamie


JR- I like this site. I think Virtual Field Trips are going to be the only field trips students will be able to make in the future if the economy doesn't change. I love the examples!

CH- Well designed and good info. I try to bring in guest speakers and take my students on field trips whenever applicable, but this is another great way for students to get that authentic learning experience.  It is on my list of things to do for this school year!

I added differences between packaged and teacher created/personalized field trips. Also I think we might want to put advantages and disadvantages in paragraphs, not lists.SKamara

Matthew S- SKamara you did a very nice job contributing to the Virtual Field Trips Wikibook.  I have worked with Virtual Field Trips quite a bit when I did my student teaching and you described the types of Virtual Field Trips very well.  I also thought that it was good you listed some advantages and disadvantages to your Wikibook contribution.  Very detailed and well organized, good work.

Rachel B. To SKamara - I also think you did a very nice job describing Virtual Field Trips.  I have never worked with Virtual Field Trips and you did a good job explaining the three types.  I do like the advantages and disadvantages listed.  I will have to see if there are any virtual field trips that are business related.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Use the HTML 4.01 Transitional doctype without a URL to force quirks mode on all browsers

Use the HTML 4.01 Strict doctype to force strict on all browser except IE6 and IE7, which use almost standards mode

In the W3C box model, element width excludes padding and borders

In the IE quirks mode box model, element width includes padding and borders, giving extra spacing between containers, but IE6 and later use the W3C box model when in standards compliant mode

Design markup so that fixed width elements that need padding or borders have width set on the container, and borders and padding set on the content element to avoid issues in IE quirks mode with the border box model

      <text xml:space="preserve">First of all congratulations for the great tutorial. I am thinking of translating it at my native language (greek). I would like to draw your attention at your second example. I think its not an appropriate example. This program uses only the statements after '''a&gt;5''' and '''a&lt;=7''' expressions. It has never been used the statement after &quot;else&quot;.  I think it would be useful to be executed all possible statements, at least once: My suggestion is something like this:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
a = 0
while a &lt; 10:
    a = a + 1
    if a &gt; 5:
        print(a, &quot;&gt;&quot;, 5)
    elif a &lt;= 3:
        print(a, &quot;&lt;=&quot;, 7)
    else:
        print(&quot;Neither test was true&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
So the statement: print(&quot;Neither test was true&quot;), is executed when a is 4
[[User:Iliasthes|Iliasthes]] ([[User talk:Iliasthes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Iliasthes|contribs]]) 19:02, 1 August 2011 (UTC)

I changed it according to your suggestion. I also replaced the high_low.py code with mine. I think it is better (for instance, the old code didn't give a tip after the first guess). The second exercise was also changed to fit the new high_low.py code. [[Special:Contributions/194.15.124.5|194.15.124.5]] ([[User talk:194.15.124.5|discuss]]) 15:06, 20 August 2012 (UTC)

: {{done}} – I changed the second example, so &lt;code&gt;print(&quot;Neither test was true&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; is executed when &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is 4 or 5.

== Solution #2 doesn't work  ==

Great tutorial!!!  

Just wanted to point out that solution #2

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
number = 7
guess = -1
count = 0

print(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;)
while guess != number:
	guess = int(input(&quot;Is it....&quot;))
	count = count + 1
	if guess == number:
		print(&quot;Hooray!  You guessed it right ! &quot;)
	elif guess &lt; number:
		print(&quot;It's bigger....&quot;)
	elif guess &gt; number:
		print(&quot;It's not so big.&quot;)

if count &lt; 3:
	print(&quot;That must have been complicated.&quot;)
else:
	print(&quot;Good job!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Doesn't trigger after three failed attempts.   You might need to check this one again !   
I'm still learning python so I have no solution for you, but I wanted to alert you that this doesn't work.  (It won't give the message after three attempts (or more ) ).    ''' -- Dave -- '''

: Aside from the mistranscription (you have a comparison operator backwards), what exactly is wrong with the example?  The exercise is supposed to have the user keep guessing, and once the number is found, determine whether or not the user took more than three guesses. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sigma 7|contribs]]) 16:18, 17 May 2013 (UTC)

== Update ==

I just got it to work, believe it or not, it appears to be a syntax issue:


&lt;source lang=python&gt;

# Number game...but will keep track of the number,  3 wrong attempts end the game.



number = 543
guess = -1
current_count = 0
print (&quot;This program will give you three chances to guess the number.  Fail and the game ends&quot;)
print(&quot;Guess the number&quot;)
while guess !=number:
	guess=int(input(&quot;Is it.....&quot;))
	current_count=current_count+1	
	if guess &lt; number:
		print(&quot; It's much larger.....&quot;)
	elif guess &gt; number:
		print(&quot;It's not that big......&quot;)
	elif guess == number:
		print(&quot;You won!  Saw's been defeated!!&quot;)
		

	if current_count == 3:
		print(&quot;Game Over!!!!&quot;)
		break

&lt;/source&gt;

Notice, that the &quot;You won&quot; section occurs at the bottom of the &quot;if&quot; statements.  Aside from that one change, it's fine, and yeah, I know, I made the code a bit goofy  :)
Thanks

      <text xml:space="preserve">Blogs are entries on a computer that are updated on a regular basis by the author. These entries can be about anything, political views, certain topics, personal life, or anything else that the &quot;author&quot; wants to write about. They are used by businesses as well as individuals. Anyone could be an author.  Blogs are also short for the term &quot;web logs&quot; and they are used to enhance collaboration between its users.   

==Brief History of Blogs==
Blogs were first introduced with the creation of the current Web 2.0 software.  Web 2.0 is known as the read and write Web and blogging is essentially writing on a particular topic, posting that blog, and another user is going to read that topic of particular interest.  When blogs were first introduced they were meant simply to be used as someone's own personal diary.  There was not supposed to be any type of interaction and collaboration between the users of the blogs.  Since blogs were first introduced they have been utilized in a completely different manner.  Blogs are now meant to have a high level of interaction between individuals.  Blogging is all about reading and writing and being creative with those posts.  The main idea behind blogging was to be used solely as a means of communicating but now it has been taken to a whole new level.  Blogging is completely free and it can be used by anyone that has internet access and it can be used in so many different ways to support the writing process. 
    
Blogs have the following characteristics&lt;ref&gt;Eglodes (2011) Using Blogs in your Classroom. Retrieved from http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0I1V5XaMsc&lt;/ref&gt;: 
* scrolling entries
* sorted by date (newest is at the top)
* easy to add information
* can subscribe to 
* searchable

[[File:Today I....jpg|thumb|Blogs are easy to create. All it takes is one idea. Anyone can do it. Your diary could be shared with everyone.]]
•A blog is normally a single page of entries. There may be archives of older entries, but the &quot;main page&quot; of a blog is all anyone really cares about.
•A blog is organized in reverse-chronological order, from most recent entry to least recent.
•A blog is normally public -- the whole world can see it.
•The entries in a blog usually come from a single author.
•The entries in a blog are usually stream-of-consciousness. There is no particular order to them. For example, if I see a good link, I can throw it in my blog. The tools that most bloggers use make it incredibly easy to add entries to a blog any time they feel like it.

== How Do Blogs Work? ==
Blogs are created via blog hosting websites such as [http://www.blogger.com Blogger], [http://wordpress.org/ Wordpress], or [http://edublogs.org/ Edublogs]. Typically, a user registers a username and password, picks a blog title and URL, and then can immediately begin his or her first post, or entry. 

A post can include a combination or writing, photos, videos, links, and other embedded materials. Once the post is ready, the author can instantly publish it to the blog. Other people are then able to view the post (depending on settings--a blogger can choose to make his or her blog private, public, or shared with certain people). 

Readers can subscribe to the blog and receive updates in their e-mail or RSS reader. Posts can be shared via social networking tools such as Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. Bloggers can also enable commenting, which means readers can write responses to blog posts that will appear along with the post for other readers to see. &lt;ref&gt;Eglodes (2011) Using Blogs in your Classroom.

== Cons of Using Blogs in the Classroom ==

There are several cons when it comes to using blogs in the classroom &lt;ref&gt;Crie, M. (2006). [http://www.glencoe.com/sec/teachingtoday/educationupclose.phtml/47 Using blogs to integrate technology in the classroom]. Glencoe Online.   &lt;/ref&gt;

* Not all students have a home computer
* Access to computer labs in schools may be limited
* Students in a class may only post comments to their friends&lt;ref&gt;Cottle A.

== How Blogging Can Be Used in Education ==

Teachers can use blogs to communicate with students and parents.  Teachers can use their blog to give detailed information on what students are doing in the classroom, post homework assignments for absent students, and allow a comment section for specific questions that students or parents might have.

Blogging engages students in active learning, increases student and teacher relationships, increases higher-order thinking skills, and improves flexibility in teaching and learning (Ferdig &amp; Roehler, 2003). Classroom blogging sites provide students with opportunities to share their viewpoints, and a supportive environment for reading and writing (Huffaker, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Cottle A. Integrating 21st Century Skills in Schools Using a Class Blogging Project Retrieved from: http://www.wvcpd.org/PLAJournal/ActionResearch-BloggingProject/ActionResearch-BloggingProject/BloggingProject.htm== References ==&lt;/ref&gt;

Blogging is one way to communicate in a social context through the medium of technology. Larson and Marsh (2005) say that the practice of blogging in the classroom identifies the child as an active member of a constantly changing community of learners in which knowledge constructs and is constructed by a larger cultural system. From this point of view, conceptualizing learning creates a shift from the traditional teacher-centered classroom to one that is learner-centered. Larson and Marsh (2005), says in this type of classroom learning occurs through participation in social, cultural, and historical contexts that are intervened by instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, J., &amp; Marsh, J. (2005). Making literacy real. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage&lt;/ref&gt;  

Some teachers choose to have a class blog.  There are several uses for a class blog&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, K. (2009). Blogging in (and out of) the classroom. EmergingEdTech, Retrieved from http://www.emergingedtech.com/2009/05/blogging-in-and-out-of-the-classroom/&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Teachers post a homework question and require students to respond to the question and other classmate responses.
* Students post questions they have that can be discussed during the next class period.
* Students can post their work to the class blog and allow others to leave feedback.
* One student can take notes for the class and post them on the class blog. 
* Students, teachers, or parents comment on individual or class work on the class blog.

Other uses of a classroom blog could include&lt;ref&gt;J. Black. (2008, October 21). Web 2.0 in the Classroom: 33 Ways to use blogs in your classroom and in the educational setting. Retrieved  from http://web.archive.org/web/20101111061043/http://web20intheclassroom.blogspot.com/2008/10/ways-to-use-blogs-in-your-classroom-and.html&lt;/ref&gt;: 
* Posting classroom rules, procedures, calendars, schedules, teacher email and school phone number.
* Posting links for online books or supplemental materials, i.e. videos, podcasts, and websites.
* Uploading digital photos or videos of class projects.
* Using a recording software program upload audio files of students narrating their favorite stories or stories they have written.
* Posting reviews, by individual students, of their favorite or recently read books.
* Creating and posting of creative or reflective writing.
* Posting minutes or records of meetings for class council, clubs, PTA…
* Inviting people from around the world to describe their day to learning of cultural differences.
* Listing topics for a research project.
* Reflecting and self-assessing by teachers on a personal blog about their daily lessons, then creating suggestions or finding alternatives for future lessons.

== Classroom Blogging Tools ==

There are a growing number of classroom blogging sites designed exclusively for teachers and students.   These sites typically offer a safe, controlled environment in which students can create and share their own blogs under the supervision and administration of a teacher. &lt;ref&gt;Teaching Tips (2008) 50 Useful Blogging Tools for Teachers.  Retrieved on 02/26/13 at http://www.teachingtips.com/blog/2008/07/21/50-useful-blogging-tools-for-teachers/  &lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these sites offer limited free services, but charge for more advanced features or a larger number of student accounts. A few sites offer comprehensive services at no charge to the teacher.  &lt;ref&gt;Grove (2011) Educational blogging platforms for students. Retrieved on 02/26/13 at http://www.brighthubeducation.com/teaching-methods-tips/121823-educational-blogging-platforms-for-your-students/  &lt;/ref&gt;  The following is a list of some of the most popular educational blogging sites:

'''Kidblog.org''' is based on a simplified version of the user-friendly Wordpress interface. Teachers have full administrative control of the classroom blogs and all blogs are private and password protected. Kidblog is free and there are no ads. [[File:KidBlog.png|thumb|KidBlog]]

'''EduBlogs.org''' is a widely used educational blogging site. Edublogs offers many options and themes. The embedded calendar is one of teachers’ favorite features. Edublogs also offers extensive support on its help pages. Although some features are free, other features require the user to subscribe to various packages.

'''Weebly''' is a popular site that enables teachers to create a free class website with up to 40 student blogs. Weebly also offers many features and themes.

'''21Classes.com''' offers more features and options than some of the free educational blogging tools, but a classroom subscription costs $79 per year.

'''Classblogmeister.com''' contains fewer bells and whistles, but is still a popular educational blogging tool. One popular feature of ClassBlogmeister is the teacher moderation tools. No student posts or comments are published until the teacher has given approval.

==Guidelines for Using Blogs in the Classroom==
The use of blogs in the classroom requires the teacher to establish blogging guidelines in order to keep students safe online. These blogging guidelines should align 
with the district's Acceptable Use Policy and publicity releases. Students at the elementary level will often have more restrictive guidelines than students at the secondary level. While there are no set guidelines for using blogs in the classroom, students should be educated on proper netiquette and online safety before blogging in the classroom. It is important that students are respectful to fellow classmates and others on the internet. Student also should not post personal information including addresses, phone numbers, or personal photographs&lt;ref&gt;Magid, L. (n.d.). Kids rules for online safety (for pre-teens). Retrieved from http://www.safekids.com/kids-rules-for-online-safety/&lt;/ref&gt;. Teachers should also ensure that the username does not include the student's full name, age, date of birth, or other identifying information. Information on online safety can be found at [http://www.safekids.com/kids-rules-for-online-safety/ Safekids.com]

== Professional Development Blogs for Teachers ==

Although there are many blogs that teachers can use in the classroom with their students, there is also a multitude of blogs that teachers can use for their own professional development. Such blogs include hints on ways to be a better teacher in a certain subject area such as music, mathematics, or ESL, blogs on educational theory, blogs on advice for new teachers, blogs on where to find free technology, and blogs on transforming education, for example.  

Here is a sampling of a few of these blogs which were chosen because they are updated regularly:
*'''The Learning Network, Teaching and Learning with the New York Times''' is supported by the New York Times, is free, and is updated daily. Readers may comment on each and every post. The blog includes commentary, lesson plans, daily questions for students who may post replies, high-interest articles. http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/  
  
[[File:Becky's blog.jpg|thumb|This is a screen shot of my own blog]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Matter==
''Matter'' refers to any physical quantity that has shape, can be measured, and has its own physical, chemical and electrical properties.

===Physical Properties===
All matter exists in one of three states 
# [[Solid]] for instance an ice cube
# [[Liquid]] for instance liquid water
# [[Gas]] for instance water vapor

All matter has a mass M and a volume V that can be measured. The ratio of mass over volume defines the density of matter 
:&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{M}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

===Chemical Properties===
All matter is made up from Chemical Elements. There are about 128 Chemical elements have been discovered and tabulated in a table called Chemical Element Periodic Table invented by a Russian Scientist named Mendeli

Each Chemical Element has its own Atomic number and Mass . The Atomic number represents number of Protons in the Nucleus and number of Electrons on the orbits of Matter's Atom  
: E &lt;sup&gt;z&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;

===Sub Atomic Electric Charged Particles===
Further study of matter has shown that atoms are made up of sub-atomic particles that carry Electric charge, called ''Electric Charged Particles''. There are three basic types of charged particles:

# [[Electron]] a sub-atomic particle that has Negative Charge with a Mass M&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; denoted by a symbol e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
# [[Proton]] a sub-atomic particle that has Positive Charge with a Mass M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; denoted by a symbol p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
# [neutron]] a sub-atomic particle that has Zero Charge with a Mass M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; denoted by a symbol n&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;

==Matter Model==
Since the discovery of charged particles scientific theory has developed. It is now theorised that all matter is made up from charged particles.

===Rutherford's Model===
In 19__, Rutherford proposed a model of matter using electrons, protons and neutrons. According to Rutherford's model,
# All matter has a Mass M a Volume V and a Density equal to the ratio of Mass over Volume. All matter exists in one of three states: solid, liquid or gas
# All matter is made up from charged particles the smallest indivisible part still has the same characteristics
# All matter has a nucleus made of protons and (with some exceptions) neutrons in the center and electrons orbiting around the nucleus 
# Usually the number of electrons in the orbits is equal to the number of protons in the nucleus. 
# Only electrons in the outermost orbits can participate in chemical reactions

===Bohr's Model===
In 19__, Bohr proposed that 
# Each electrons orbit has a quanta of energy corresponding to an Energy Level Number n . 
# There are 4 Energy Level Number n = 1 ..4 .  n = 4 has the highest energy level . n = 1 has the lowest energy level 
# When an electron moves from High Energy Level to Low Energy Level Electron then electromagnetic radiation is emitted of equivalent energy 
# E&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; - E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = hf

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Electrostatic ==
Electrostatic refers to the process of matter becomes Electric Charge

Normally all matter are neutral or have net Charge equal to zero . When an object loses electron it becomes Positive Charge . When an object gains an electron it becomes  Negative Charge 
: Matter + e --&gt; [-]
: Matter - e --&gt; [+]

===Electric Charge===
All Electric Charges pocess a Quantity of Electric Charge called Electric Charge denoted as Q measured in Couloum (C) . 
: Positive Charge, +Q
: Negative Charge, -Q
===Electric Field ===
Electric Field is defined as Electric Field Lines radiate outward for Positive Charge or inward for Negative Charge. Electric Field is denoted as E measured in N/C . 
: Negative Charge , E . ---&gt; Negative Charge &lt;--- .
: Positive Charge , E .  &lt;--- Positive Charge ---&gt;
===Magnetic Field ===
Magnetic Field is defined as Elliptical Magnetic Field Lines rotates in clockwise direction for Negative Charge and Counter-Clockwise for Positive Charge 
: Negative Charge , B . 
: Positive Charge , B .  

==Interaction between Charges==
Charges interact with each other according to Coulomb's Law and creating Electric Force between Charges as follow
: ''Like Charges repulse . Unlike Charges attract , Negative Charge attract Positive Charge '' .

: When different charges interact with each other example Nagative Charge attracts Positive Chrages creates Kinetic Energy in Electricity. 
: &lt;math&gt;F = k \frac{Q_+ Q_-}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

: When there is a difference in Charge's Quantities that creates Potential Difference in Electricity 
:: mQ - nQ = (m-n) Q

==ElectroDynamic==
===ElectroMotive Force===
If there is a Electromotive Force that sets stationary charge to move in straight motion to cause a flow of charges called Current then the Electric Field can be calculated by Ampere's Law as follow
: &lt;math&gt;F = E Q&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{F}{Q}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{Q}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

===ElectroMagnetoMotive Force===
If there is a ElectroMagnetomotive Force that can change the direction of the moving charge perpendicular to the initial direction of moving charge such that Positive charge will moved up perpendicular to the initial direction and Negative Charge will move down perpendicular to the initial direction then Magnetic Field can be calculated by Lorenzt's Law
: &lt;math&gt;F = \pm B v Q&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;B = \frac{F}{v Q}&lt;/math&gt;

===ElectroMagnetic Force===
ElectroMagnetic Force is the total force acting on the moving charge equals to the sum of the Electromotive Force calculated by Ampere's Law plus the Magnetomotive Force calculated by Lorentz's Law. 
: &lt;math&gt;F = E Q \pm B v Q = Q ( E \pm v B )&lt;/math&gt;

==Matter and Electricity ==
:[[File:Band_gap_comparison.svg|400px]]

Matter that interact with Electricity is divided into three groups [[Conductor]],[[Non Conductor]],[[Semi Conductor]]  depends on the ease of how current flow in the matter

[[Conductor]] 
: All matter that allows current to flow with ease are called Conductor. For example all Metals like Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu) are used to make Conductor

[[Non Conductor]]  
: All matter that does not allow current to flow in it are called Non Conductor . For example Rubber

[[Semi Conductor]] 
: All matter that allows current to flow somewhere between conductor and non conductor are called Semi Conductor . For example Silicon (Si), Gemanium (Ge)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Conductor and Electricity==
Normally, Charges in Conductor drift randomly . When an Electric Source is connected to a conductor, The Electric Force will exert a Pressure on the charges to force charges to move in straight line causing a [[Current]] inside the conductor . The Presure of the Electric Source is called [[Voltage]]

===Voltage=== 
Voltage is defined as The pressure of the Electricity Force to make charges in the conductor to move in straight line and calculated by the ratio of Work Done on an Electric Charge . Voltage is denoted as V measured in Volt v . 
: &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{W}{Q}&lt;/math&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt;1v = \frac{1J}{1C}&lt;/math&gt;

===Current=== 
Current is defined as number of electric charges flow through an area of conductor in a period of Time . Current is calculated by the ratio of Electric Charge on Time . Current is denoted as I measured in Ampere A
: &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{Q}{t}&lt;/math&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt;1A = \frac{1C}{1s}&lt;/math&gt;

===Energy===
Power is defined as Energy of a Work over Time. Power is calculated by the product of Voltage and Current . Power is denoted as P measured in Joule J or Volt Amp VA
: &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{W}{Q} \frac{Q}{t} = \frac{W}{t} = V I&lt;/math&gt;
: 1 J = 1v x 1A

===Conductance===
Conductance is defined as the ratio of Current over Voltage . Conductance is denoted as Y measured in Siemen 1 / Ω
: &lt;math&gt;Y = \frac{I}{V} &lt;/math&gt;  
: &lt;math&gt;1S = \frac{1A}{1V}&lt;/math&gt;

===Resistance===
''Resistance'' is defined as the ratio of Voltage over Current . Resistance is denoted as R measured in Ohm 
: &lt;math&gt;R = \frac{V}{I} &lt;/math&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1V}{1A}&lt;/math&gt;

==Resistance==
===Resistance &amp; Temperature===
It's been observed that ''Resistance of a conductor changes with change in Temperature ''
: R = Ro + nT For Conductor 
: R = Ro e&lt;sup&gt;nT&lt;/sup&gt; For Semi Conductor

===Resistance &amp; Electric Power Loss===
Also, ''When conductor of resistance R conducts current . Conductor releases Heat Energy into the surrounding result in loss of Electric Power Energy directly proportional to the resistance of the conductor''
: &lt;math&gt;P_R = I^2 R = \frac{V^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

==Energy Supply , Loss and Deliver==
The Energy supplies to the conductor
: &lt;math&gt;E_V = V I &lt;/math&gt;

The Energy loss as Dissipated Heat
: &lt;math&gt;E_R = I^2 R = \frac{V^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt; 

The Energy Delivered without loss
: &lt;math&gt;E_V = E_V - E_R&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;E_V = VI - I^2 R = I (V - IR)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;E_V = VI - \frac{V^2}{R} = V (I - \frac{V}{R})&lt;/math&gt;

==Energy transfer Efficiency==
The efficiecy of Power transmission can be calculated as the percentage of Real Power over the Supplied Power
: &lt;math&gt;n = \frac{E_o}{E_i}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;n = \frac{E_i Cos \theta}{E_i} = Cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;n = \frac{V - IR}{V}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;n = \frac{I - \frac{V}{R}}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Logic NAND==
NAND gates are one of the two basic logic gates (the other being NOR gates) from which any other logic gates can be built. Due to this property, NAND and NOR gates are sometimes called &quot;universal gates&quot;. However, modern integrated circuits are not constructed exclusively from a single type of gate. Instead, EDA tools are used to convert the description of a logical circuit to a netlist of complex gates (standard cells) or transistors (full custom approach).

==Combinational Gates==
===NOT===
A NOT gate is made by joining the inputs of a NAND gate. Since a NAND gate is equivalent to an AND gate followed by a NOT gate, joining the inputs of a NAND gate leaves only the NOT part.

|}
|}

===AND===
An AND gate is made by following a NAND gate with a NOT gate as shown below. This gives a NOT NAND, i.e. AND.

|-
| 0 || 1 ||  || 0
|-
| 1 || 0 ||  || 0
|-
| 1 || 1 ||  || 1
|}
|}

===OR===
If the truth table for a NAND gate is examined or by applying [[A-level Computing/AQA/Computer Components, The Stored Program Concept and the Internet/Fundamental Hardware Elements of Computers/De Morgan's Laws|De Morgan's Laws]], it can be seen that if any of the inputs are 0, then the output will be 1. However to be an OR gate, if any input is 1, the output must also be 1. Therefore, if the inputs are inverted, any high input will trigger a high output.

|-
| 0 || 1 ||  || 1
|-
| 1 || 0 ||  || 1
|-
| 1 || 1 ||  || 1
|}
|}

===NOR===
A NOR gate is simply an OR gate with an inverted output:

{| align=center style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
!width=150|Desired Gate!!width=150|NAND Construction
|-
|[[Image:NOR ANSI Labelled.svg]]||[[Image:NOR from NAND.svg]]

|-
| 0 || 1 ||  || 0
|-
| 1 || 0 ||  || 0
|-
| 1 || 1 ||  || 0
|}
|}

===XOR===
An XOR gate is constructed similarly to an OR gate, except with an additional NAND gate inserted such that if both inputs are high, the inputs to the final NAND gate will also be high, and the output will be low. This effectively represents the formula: &quot;(A NAND (A NAND B)) NAND (B NAND (A NAND B))&quot;.

| 0 || 1 ||  || 1
|-
| 1 || 0 ||  || 1
|-
| 1 || 1 ||  || 0
|}
|}

===XNOR===

Don't use the same class to set both dimensions and other box model rules including margins, borders, and padding to avoid limiting the reuse of size or spacing rules among different elements

Use a simple class selector, such as .new{ font:bold;} instead of creating complex descendant selectors to define a single property, such as .menu .title .new{ font:bold; } to maximize to readability and reusability of the codebase
 
Don't use DOM property names (length, item, namedItem, tags, urns) as ID values since they will cause JavaScript conflicts in IE since it considers property names to be reserved words

Don't use attribute name values as ID values since they will cause JavaScript conflicts in IE. For example, using &quot;description&quot; as an ID value may conflict with the description meta tag.

Create unique new classes instead of parent dependent subclasses

Copy common properties, such as colors and font size, to new classes as a preventive measure so that an element is not dependent on multiple classes due to a single property of each one, since the class references in the HTML may end up looking like inline styling. This also helps avoid inheriting unneeded properties, such as padding and margins, and subsequently needed to reset these properties in new classes 

Minimize usage of the descendant selector (e.g. #parent .child) and the child selectors when styling elements to avoid long lookups of the DOM tree

Define classes to style block level elements(.content) instead of using tag references by ID (#main p) to make them independent of their parent elements

Define state changes in CSS by prepending copies of existing selectors with semantic class names that map to JavaScript functions, then append the class name to the documentElement when the DOM event is triggered

Avoid semicolons on the last style declaration to avoid accidentally typing the end bracket before the semicolon and generating an error

Avoid naming conventions in which a class describes the property it invokes so that the style sheet does not become a one-to-one mapping of names to functionality which leads to HTML code which resembles inline styling with multiple class references for every element.

Use styles to set properties for tables instead of table tag attributes for cross browser consistency

Add subclasses for common needs, such as highlighting the first or last item in a list, hiding and showing comment text, emphasizing the current navigation selection, and switching star rating colors on and off

Use semantic ID names for standard layout components, when there is only one such component per page, such as banner, logo, badge, screenshot, thumbnail, breadcrumbs, navigation, sidebars, marquee, subnav, content, gutter, headmargin, footmargin, sidemargin, baseline, overlay, fold, ads, widgets, and audio/video players
For example,

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;img id=&quot;background&quot; src=&quot;background.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;logo&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Fun Ball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Use semantic class names for standard prose components that may need specific styling, such as sentence, phrase, clause, salutation, lead-in, suffix, prefix, anagram, homonym, contraction, gerund, idiom, interjection, onomatopoeia, timespan, etc.

Use semantic class names for standard article components that may need specific styling, such as headshot, caption, mugshot, masthead, folio, subhead, dateline, byline, topic, bio, ticker, alert, boilerplate, dropcap, slogan, keyword, tease, sample, snippet, sidebar, boxscore, ranking, standing, poll, addendum, soundbite, pullquote, plugs, followup, letterhead, etc.

Use semantic class names for essay components that may need specific styling, such as objective, excerpt, aside, citation, footnote, topic, annotation, summary, table of contents, etc.
For example,

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;(a parenthetical aside)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;(another parenthetical aside)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Style fonts and colors for standard layout components first to avoid redundancy and take advantage of the cascade when defining nested elements

Reset styles at the beginning of the style sheet to overwrite inconsistent defaults across browsers

Remove redundant and obsolete styles when moving test code to production

Use classes instead of IDs for any code intended to work inside the sandbox of a third party API, since IDs may be stripped out to avoid conflicts

Use the following XSLT CSS preprocessor template to add CSS variables to your stylesheet using browser or server-side scripting:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot; version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsl:output method=&quot;text&quot; omit-xml-declaration=&quot;yes&quot; media-type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;color&quot; select=&quot;'#fff'&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;*&quot;&gt;
        h1 { color: &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;$color&quot;/&gt;; }
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Twitter in Schools: Adam Z &amp; Jon R ==
[[File:Twittmx-party-twitter-2153688-l.jpg|Twittmx-party-twitter-2153688-l|center|]]
=== Introduction ===
 
The beginning of the school year is approaching fast. You may be thinking what can you do different this year? How can you stand out above the crowd? How can your school become a larger part of the school community?

While Twitter is beginning to catch on with many educators, schools are lagging in their adoption of the platform. But let's think about it. Twitter is a quick and easy tool to let the entire school community know what’s going on with you and your students. Updates can come from anywhere and users don't have to have a Twitter account to follow along.

But where do you start? What are some things to consider? Here is some advice for schools (and districts) that want to start using Twitter.

== Think First ==
 There are a few questions you and your team (and it should be a team) will want to ask and answer before you jump in:
There are a few questions you and your team (and it should be a team) will want to ask and answer before you jump in:
What do you want to do with this account? What do you hope to accomplish? What do you want to communicate? So, you are going to have a Twitter account. Great! Why? What do you want to tell people? The possibilities here are really endless. But think beyond the basic stuff like picture day and what's for lunch. Consider taking pictures of kids doing collaborative projects or highlighting staff of the month. It can really go beyond all the regular communication and show the community what your school (or district) is all about. 
Who will be in charge of the account? Will there be just one person who will post or will you have multiple people who post? This is all situation dependent. I would say more than one person is great but too many and things can get out of hand and duplicate information could easily be posted. Keep it simple and experiment to find what works for your group.
Will you follow anyone? Again, this is situation dependent. You may want to follow other schools and the teachers in your school but will you follow parents? Students? Community members? If you are just going to be broadcasting following becomes less of an issue. If you want to facilitate interaction then following is important and your group will need to decide some guidelines on who to follow. 
If someone sends you an @ message, will you respond? Often times your account will get mentioned or someone will send you a question. Your group will need to decide how to handle these questions. Many districts have a [http://twitter.com/#!/wsfcs Twitter account] but it is a one way conversation. It rarely will respond to questions from the general public. (Walker, 2011, n.pag)&lt;ref&gt;Walker, L. (2011). Nine Reasons to Twitter in Schools. Retrieved July 31, 2011, from Tech and Learning website: http://www.techlearning.com/article/17340&lt;/ref&gt;.

== A Name ==
Now you are ready to set up your account. You will need an email address that is not already associated with a Twitter account already. If you can have a generic email set up by the district that is the best way to handle that. Otherwise you will have to find an email address to use. (You could always set up a dummy gmail address as well.) The email address is used to confirm the account and sent notices of DM's and new followers and such. You will want to pick a name that is easy to remember and is your school's brand. This is the point where you will define who your school will be on Twitter. Remember though, users only have 140 characters to tweet with and if your user name is @RonaldReganHighSchool that doesn't leave a lot for others to tweet with. So maybe you go with @RRHS. Adding your location like town or state doesn't hurt either. Just keep it simple. And remember, there are several hundred million Twitter users so don't be disappointed if your first choice for a username is taken. Get creative and find something that can become your brand (Twitter for Academia, 2008, n.pag)&lt;ref&gt;Twitter for Academia. (2008). Retrieved July 30, 2011, from AcademHack website: http://academhack.outsidethetext.com/home/2008/twitter-for-academia/&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Profile ==
A profile will go a long way in letting people know who you are. This is the place you can put in your full school name, location, description and link to your school website. You will also want to put in a picture, either of a mascot or school symbol. That helps other users identify, quickly, who you are.
 
== Hashtags ==
“A good idea is to also come up with a hashtag. This will allow you to track conversations even if your account is not mentioned in a tweet. The hashtag is good because classes and teachers can send tweets and still reference your school with out mentioning you in the tweet. You can then collect them and retweet them as you see fit. And you don't have to follow everyone either to see what folks are saying. If you have monitors set up near your entrance you can use a program like [http://www.twitterfall.com/ Twitterfall] to display all the tweets coming in on your hashtag. That might also entice folks to check out your Twitter account and learn more about your presence there” Anderson, 2011, n.pag)&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, S. (2011, June 15). Twitter. Retrieved July 31, 2011, from Blogging about the web 2.0 connected classroom website: (Unable to upload website as it is black listed by wiki books)&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Letting Others Know ==
The account does no good if no one knows about it. Let everyone know. Put a [http://twitter.com/about/resources/widgets widget] on your website so every time folks visit they see your updates. Tell parents about it in mailings home. A simple &quot;Follow Us On Twitter&quot; and a link will go a long way into getting folks to see what you are saying. You may also want to make some videos on how to find your updates and what you will be using your account for.

== Resistance to a School Twitter  ==
[[File:Feed-icon.svg|thumb|Feed-icon]] You may find resistance to the idea of a school Twitter account because folks don't want one of their own. They don't have to have one. The easiest way to follow updates is to have their own account but they can also subscribe via the RSS feed found on your profile page, subscribe through [http://support.twitter.com/groups/34-mobile/topics/123-mobile-basics/articles/14014-twitter-phone-faq SMS (text) messages on their phone] (they have to have an account for this) or they can add the Facebook widget to their page and see the updates every time they visit. And remember, you should have the widget on your school webpage so there are many ways to see the updates without actually your community using the service themselves (Anderson, 2011, n.pag)&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, S. (2011, June 15). Twitter. Retrieved July 31, 2011, from Blogging about the web 2.0 connected classroom website: (Unable to upload website as it is black listed by wiki books)&lt;/ref&gt;.
 

There are some other basics you will need, especially if you haven't Tweeted before. Check out [http://livebinders.com/play/play_or_edit?id=34291 Steve Anderson’s the Twitter In Education Livebinder] for the basics.

== Pros ==
-Twitter is a great way for groups to communicate.

-Forces students to be brief and get right to the point in discussions. Students are only allowed 140 characters so they cannot fill up a page of a discussion board. 

-Twitter can hold students accountable as the teacher can see all the tweets. Teachers can have students tweet their progress of papers and projects.

-Teachers can tweet homework assignments. This would ensure that every students knows what the assignment is and when it is due.

-Teachers can use it to announce tests and quizzes.test and quizzes dates. This is a great way for teachers to let students know about up coming tests and give the students a reminder the night before.

-Can be used for reminders of deadlines. Often times projects and papers are started about 2 to 3 weeks prior to being due. Teachers can send out tweets of weekly reminders. 

-Teachers can have students Essential questions is a tweet, again this would have to be short and sweet.

-Schools could tweet the morning announcements. This would ensure that athletes know if they have to leave school early and at what time. Students would know what is for lunch and any other events that will be coming up.

== Cons ==
-Schools cannot control what students are tweeting. students could start tweeting inappropriate messages. 

-Every student needs a Twitter account and access to the account to be used effectively.

-Students need to have Internet connection at home to use outside of school.

-Students could start trying to tweet in class just like they send text messages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Corley C. to Group 2- I especially enjoyed reading about how blogs can be used in education.  As a math teacher, I never had my students use blogs before, but after reading your ideas, I have definitely considered how to use one in my classroom.  Thank you!

SKamara-Wilkes Summer 1 2013 Team- Nice job adding information about history of and guidelines for using blogs. Informative and easy to understand.

SShoop- I added the section about Guidelines for Using Blogs dicussing online safety and netiquette. I also added an Internet Safety graphic I made, but is hasn't shown up yet.
[[User:1sshoop|1sshoop]] ([[User talk:1sshoop|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/1sshoop|contribs]]) 03:31, 11 June 2013 (UTC)

Robin G. - The Brief History of Blogs looks fine. Nice explaination Matthew, it wa clear and concise----

Matthew S.- I have added a brief description of &quot;The Brief History of Blogs&quot; and I also added the line about Blogs are also short for the term &quot;web logs&quot; and they are used to enhance collaboration between between its users.  This Wikibook I felt was very well done and organized.  I also added a picture of a group of individuals blogging together and collaborating in the same area.

Rachel B. to Matthew S. - Nice job with the history section.  Did not know that blogs were meant to just be a diary in the beginning.

Jami N. - Thank you for adding the section on Blogs for Teachers. I knew about one or two but not all and have bookmarked this page!

Amanda R. - I am very impressed with the way using blogs in the classroom can contribute to many more ways for teachers, students and parents to collaborate.  Thank you for the useful information you contributed to this Wiki!  [[Special:Contributions/67.165.9.90|67.165.9.90]] ([[User talk:67.165.9.90|discuss]]) 16:35, 3 March 2013 (UTC)

Jessica S- Becky, your contributions to this page is well developed and extremely helpful to educators! [[User:Jschaffer|Jschaffer]] ([[User talk:Jschaffer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jschaffer|contribs]]) 02:29, 3 March 2013 (UTC)

Andrew W. Thanks for your help with this, Becky! ∼∼∼∼

Becky G. - I added the section &quot;Professional Development Blogs for Teachers&quot; and uploaded the screen shot of one of my blog sites to fulfill my assignment for this class [[User:Beckywish|Beckywish]] ([[User talk:Beckywish|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beckywish|contribs]]) 13:05, 2 March 2013 (UTC)

Becky G. - To add to discussion, click on Discussion and then Edit and type in your comment.  Finally add four tildes then click Save at the bottom of the page [[User:Beckywish|Beckywish]] ([[User talk:Beckywish|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beckywish|contribs]]) 05:21, 2 March 2013 (UTC)

Becky G - I am trying to figure out how to add to the discussion. [[User:Beckywish|Beckywish]] ([[User talk:Beckywish|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beckywish|contribs]]) 05:18, 2 March 2013 (UTC)

Alana = Pros, Cons, and how blogs can be used in education.  Added some references.

jreph- What is a blog, how it works, references (linking), pictures, links

LK - I liked reading about blogs.  I've heard a lot about them, but I have never used them.  This is a good reference tool.


JR - Great resource on Blogs. I think blogs should be a big part of education and a great resource for student centered work.

SRainey- A very thorough resource. I appreciated that you mentioned the importance of setting security settings in order to prevent student blogs from being viewed publicly.

GI - Great job! I like the idea of the weekly homework blog.

KZ - Since so many of our teachers are worried about this sort of technology, I will now show them this page to start their use.  Good job!

LW - Nice additions.  I have used a blog in the past and I feel the Pros far outweigh the Cons.
JB - I am you added a pros and cons list. Perhaps it is the math teacher in me, but I always like to compare things logically.

KS - You added some great resources for blogs.  I have not had a lot of experience with using blogs in the past but I would like to learn more.  This page really will help me explore and learn more on blogs.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Steph Rainey - I worked on the Pros/Cons secion, as well as the sections on machinma and notecards. I contributed to the definition of Second Life. I uploaded the image of the Second Life logo and embeded the link to the machinima that I created and published on Youtube. We both took care of the references that pertained to our sections.

Jo Ann Noble - I worked on the simulation, display and exhibits, digitial storytelling, and role-playing sections. I uploaded the image of the Spaceflight Museum, and I also contributed to the definition of Second Life.

MW- Since I am taking this class as well right now I wanted to see what information you have on there! Very good overview! I loved all of the resources especially as I add to my machinima.

SJ- Your page is very thorough! Although I have learned about Second Life in other classes, I never knew exactly how much it could be used in education. You also provided a plenitude of resources!</text>

It is easy to recognize life. Cats, trees in our gardens, ourselves etc. are all alive. Computers, the air we breathe, waterfalls, etc. whereas, not alive. But what is life? What makes living beings different from sand, water? 

Cell biology tries to answer what life is, where it comes from and how it functions. From that, cell biologists draw a general rule for all living things on Earth.

== What is Skype? ==
Skype is a software application that can be used to connect to someone when you are apart as long as you have internet access.  This software application has text, voice, and video which makes it easier to connect to people who are not with you.  Skype can be used on a phone, computer, or TV as long as there is internet access and the computer is turned on.  A person can communicate for personal or work related reasons.   

== How does Skype work? ==
•	You must first add other Skype contacts
•	Highlight names or names, then right click and to select call
•	There is a hang up button to end the call
•	To answer a call you will click answer or reject which appears on the computer screen
•	Update online status by clicking on status icon and changing to online, Skype Me!, away, not available, do not disturb, invisible, or offline
•	Transfer a call by clicking on more and then clicking on another Skype user.

== Advantages ==
•	Free videoconferencing with other Skype users
•	Drag/Drop files and transfer directly and securely
•	Screen share around the globe
•	Conference call up to 25 people
•	PC or Mac

== Disadvantages ==
•	Computer must be turned on with software running to work
•	Must pay when contacting a landline phone or cell phone
•	Cannot directly talk to a customer service representative on the phone, but instead must submit support
•	Interference if using Skype-Wifi due to microwaves or other devices that operate on same frequency
==Educational Advantages of Using Skype in the Classroom==
It is easy to connect your classroom to the world using Skype.  It is free and easy for teachers to open up their classrooms to meet new people, talk to experts and share learning experiences.  There are over 50,000 teachers as members and over 2,600 lessons offered through Skype.  The following are some ways Skype is being used:

•  Collaborating with other students – Students can create math problems for other students to solve.  They can read and share their writing with students around the globe.

•  Author Visits – Students can chat with an author they study via skype.

•  Virtual Field Trips – If students aren’t able to participate in a field trip, use skype to bring the field trip to the classroom.  For example, visiting a TV production site guided by one of the student´s parents who works there, which includes all students despite budgetary or distance constraints.

•  Student Inclusion - Helping an ill classmate join the classroom from home.

•  After School Help – Tutors, teachers or librarians can be available after school for students to help students with homework.  

•  Promotes Community – Students can share a performance or invite parents to see what is happening in the classroom. 

•  Foreign Language &amp; Culture Lessons – Teachers use Skype to connect local students with native speaking students from other countries.  Skype allows students to see in real-time what people’s lives, homes, schools, weather, and more look like in other countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to Cell Biology ==

It is easy to recognize life. Cats, trees in our gardens, ourselves, etc., are all alive. Computers, the air we breathe, waterfalls, etc., these are not alive. But what is life? What makes living beings different from sand, water? 

Cell biology tries to answer what life is, where it comes from and how it functions. From that, cell biologists draw a general rule for all living things on Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to Gene Expression ==

All cells today have some common properties. Their genetic instructions are stored in DNA molecules. The DNA can be thought as 2 candy bars. These 2 bars will be separated, each bar ''transcribed'' to one RNA. In that bar, amino acids (can be thought as candies), will be separated again, rearranged into meaningful orders. This is called ''translation''. When it is done, the bar (which arranged candies) is now our protein.
There are 20 amino acids. However, their order in proteins varies from species to species. That means all cells have same set of amino acids, but they translate it differently. It is analogous to Latin symbols, each language has its own properties.

== The Great Ancestor ==

Because basic properties of all cells are so identical, people think they must have been derived from one ancestor. Scientists have estimated that ancestor living around 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago.

== Evolution ==

Cells reproduce themselves by splitting their genetic instructions into 2 parts, each one pasted to a daughter cell. That explains why 2 daughter cells look like their mother. But this splitting (mutation) is not perfect. It corrupts at some stage, somewhere. That again explains why 2 daughter cells are not completely identical to their mother. If mutation leads to bad results (the descendants die easier, etc.) the daughter cells will be eliminated (because they die soon). If
mutation leads to good results, its descendants will survive. If mutation is neither good nor bad, the nature will not like it very much, but it will survive anyway. From time to time, species emerged and species extinct. The good survive, the bad die. All diverge from one ancestor.

It is helpful to note that 2 daughter cells are chemically alike, in other words, they are one species. It is not necessary that their size is the same, as yeasts' daughter cells are asymmetric.

1 μm = 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt;m = 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;mm

== Light Microscope ==

One can use a light microscope to see living cells, its plasma membrane, nucleus and probably some most prominent organelles (with the help of a computer), as it can not see things smaller than 0.2 μm (due to light wavelength, not to the quality of lens).

== Electron Microscope ==

One can see things about a few nm in size. The organelles appear very clearly. Although you have to kill all cells before you see them. You cannot see wet cells under an electron microscope as well. You have to cover your specimen with a very thin layer of heavy metal before you can work with it.

== Naked eye ==


Some very large cells can be seen with the eye alone. An example of this is gromia sphaerica which has a maximum specimen size of 38 mm (millimeters).

[[File:0033 Louvre Venus de Milo.jpg|250px|thumb|left|“Venus de Milo”, a famous ancient Greek sculpture. Note the complex lighting environment.]]
This tutorial introduces '''image-based lighting''', in particular '''diffuse (irradiance) environment mapping''' and its implementation with cube maps.

This tutorial is based on {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Reflecting Surfaces}}. If you haven't read that tutorial, this would be a very good time to read it.

===Diffuse Lighting by Many Lights===
Consider the lighting of the sculpture in the image {{Hide in print|to the left}}{{Only in print|below}}. There is natural light coming through the windows. Some of this light bounces off the floor, walls and visitors before reaching the sculpture. Additionally, there are artificial light sources, and their light is also shining directly and indirectly onto the sculpture. How many directional lights and point lights would be needed to simulate this kind of complex lighting environment convincingly? At least more than a handful (probably more than a dozen) and therefore the performance of the lighting computations is challenging. 

This problem is addressed by image-based lighting. For static lighting environments that are described by an environment map, e.g. a cube map, image-based lighting allows us to compute the lighting by an arbitrary number of light sources with a single texture lookup in a cube map (see {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Reflecting Surfaces}} for a description of cube maps). How does it work?

In this section we focus on diffuse lighting. Assume that every texel (i.e. pixel) of a cube map acts as a directional light source. (Remember that cube maps are usually assumed to be infinitely large such that only directions matter, but positions don't.) The resulting lighting for a given surface normal direction can be computed as described in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Diffuse Reflection}}. It's basically the cosine between the surface normal vector '''N''' and the vector to the light source '''L''': 

&lt;math&gt;I_\text{diffuse} = I_\text{incoming}\,k_\text{diffuse} \max(0,\mathbf{N}\cdot \mathbf{L})&lt;/math&gt;

Since the texels are the light sources, '''L''' is just the direction from the center of the cube to the center of the texel in the cube map. A small cube map with 32×32 texels per face has already 32×32×6 = 6144 texels. Adding the illumination by thousands of light sources is not going to work in real time. However, for a static cube map we can compute the diffuse illumination for all possible surface normal vectors '''N''' in advance and store them in a lookup table. When lighting a point on a surface with a specific surface normal vector, we can then just look up the diffuse illumination for the specific surface normal vector '''N''' in that precomputed lookup table. 
   
Thus, for a specific surface normal vector '''N''' we add (i.e. integrate) the diffuse illumination by all texels of the cube map. We store the resulting diffuse illumination for this surface normal vector in a second cube map (the “diffuse irradiance environment map” or “diffuse environment map” for short). This second cube map will act as a lookup table, where each direction (i.e. surface normal vector) is mapped to a color (i.e. diffuse illumination by potentially thousands of light sources). The fragment shader is therefore really simple (this one could use the vertex shader from {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Reflecting Surfaces}}):

&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         #ifdef FRAGMENT
 
         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = textureCube(_Cube, normalDirection);
         }
 
         #endif
&lt;/source&gt;
It is just a lookup of the precomputed diffuse illumination using the surface normal vector of the rasterized surface point. However, the precomputation of the diffuse environment map is somewhat more complicated as described in the next section.

===Computation of Diffuse Environment Maps===
This section presents some JavaScript code to illustrate the computation of cube maps for diffuse (irradiance) environment maps. In order to use it in Unity, choose '''Create &gt; JavaScript''' in the '''Project View'''. Then open the script in Unity's text editor, copy the JavaScript code into it, and attach the script to the game object that has a material with the shader presented below. When a new cube map of sufficiently small dimensions is specified for the shader property &lt;code&gt;_OriginalCube&lt;/code&gt; (which is labeled '''Environment Map''' in the shader user interface), the script will update the shader property &lt;code&gt;_Cube&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. '''Diffuse Environment Map''' in the user interface) with a corresponding diffuse environment map. Note that the script only accepts cube maps of face dimensions 32×32 or smaller because the computation time tends to be very long for larger cube maps. Thus, when creating a cube map in Unity, make sure to choose a sufficiently small size.

The script includes only a handful of functions: &lt;code&gt;Awake()&lt;/code&gt; initializes the variables; &lt;code&gt;Update()&lt;/code&gt; takes care of communicating with the user and the material (i.e. reading and writing shader properties); &lt;code&gt;computeFilteredCubemap()&lt;/code&gt; does the actual work of computing the diffuse environment map; and &lt;code&gt;getDirection()&lt;/code&gt; is a small utility function for &lt;code&gt;computeFilteredCubemap()&lt;/code&gt; to compute the direction associated with each texel of a cube map. Note that &lt;code&gt;computeFilteredCubemap()&lt;/code&gt; not only integrates the diffuse illumination but also avoids discontinuous seams between faces of the cube map by setting neighboring texels along the seams to the same averaged color.

===Complete Shader Code===
As promised, the actual shader code is very short; the vertex shader is a reduced version of the vertex shader of {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Reflecting Surfaces}}:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
Shader &quot;GLSL shader with image-based diffuse lighting&quot; {
   Properties {
      _OriginalCube (&quot;Environment Map&quot;, Cube) = &quot;&quot; {}
      _Cube (&quot;Diffuse Environment Map&quot;, Cube) = &quot;&quot; {}
   }
   SubShader {
      Pass {   
         GLSLPROGRAM

         // Uniform specified by the user or by a script
         uniform samplerCube _Cube; // the diffuse environment map   

         // The following built-in uniforms
         // are also defined in &quot;UnityCG.glslinc&quot;, 
         // i.e. one could #include &quot;UnityCG.glslinc&quot; 
         uniform mat4 _World2Object; // inverse model matrix

         // Varyings         
         varying vec3 normalDirection;

         #ifdef VERTEX

         void main()
         {            
            mat4 modelMatrixInverse = _World2Object; // unity_Scale.w 
               // is unnecessary because we normalize vectors
 
            normalDirection = normalize(vec3(
               vec4(gl_Normal, 0.0) * modelMatrixInverse));
 
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
 
         #endif
 
         #ifdef FRAGMENT
 
         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = textureCube(_Cube, normalDirection);
         }
 
         #endif
 
         ENDGLSL
      }
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Changes for Specular (i.e. Glossy) Reflection===
The shader and script above are sufficient to compute diffuse illumination by a large number of static, directional light sources. But what about the specular illumination discussed in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Specular Highlights}}, i.e.:

&lt;math&gt;I_\text{specular} = I_\text{incoming}\,k_\text{specular} \max(0, \mathbf{R}\cdot \mathbf{V})^{n_\text{shininess}}&lt;/math&gt;

First, we have to rewrite this equation such that it depends only on the direction to the light source '''L''' and the reflected view vector '''R'''&lt;math&gt;_\text{view}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;I_\text{specular} = I_\text{incoming}\,k_\text{specular} \max(0, \mathbf{R}_\text{view}\cdot \mathbf{L})^{n_\text{shininess}}&lt;/math&gt;

With this equation, we can compute a lookup table (i.e. a cube map) that contains the specular illumination by many light sources for any reflected view vector '''R'''&lt;math&gt;_\text{view}&lt;/math&gt;. In order to look up the specular illumination with such a table, we just need to compute the reflected view vector and perform a texture lookup in a cube map. In fact, this is exactly what the shader code of {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Reflecting Surfaces}} does. Thus, we actually only need to compute the lookup table.

It turns out that the JavaScript code presented above can be easily adapted to compute such a lookup table. All we have to do is to change the line

&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
weight = weight * Mathf.Max(0.0, 
   Vector3.Dot(filteredDirection, originalDirection)); 
   // directional filter for diffuse illumination
&lt;/source&gt;

to

&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
weight = weight * Mathf.Pow(Mathf.Max(0.0, 
   Vector3.Dot(filteredDirection, originalDirection)), 50.0); 
   // directional filter for specular illumination
&lt;/source&gt;

where &lt;code&gt;50.0&lt;/code&gt; should be replaced by a variable for &lt;math&gt;n_\text{shininess}&lt;/math&gt;. This allows us to compute lookup tables for any specific shininess. (The same cube map could be used for varying values of the shininess if the mipmap-level was specified explicitly using the &lt;code&gt;textureCubeLod&lt;/code&gt; instruction in the shader; however, this technique is beyond the scope of this tutorial.)

===Summary===
Congratulations, you have reached the end of a rather advanced tutorial! We have seen:
*What image-based rendering is about.
*How to compute and use a cube map to implement a diffuse environment map.
*How to adapt the code for specular reflection.

===Further Reading===
If you still want to know more 
* about cube maps, you should read {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Reflecting Surfaces}}.
* about (dynamic) diffuse environment maps, you could read Chapter 10, “Real-Time Computation of Dynamic Irradiance Environment Maps” by Gary King of the book “GPU Gems 2” by Matt Pharr (editor) published 2005 by Addison-Wesley, which is available [http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter10.html online].

When I was young, they teach me 1 + 1 = 2. I asked them &quot;Why?&quot;. They just laughed at me and said &quot;1 + 1 is 2, that's all!&quot;. If you also laugh, then this book is not for you. This book is intended to ones who are really serious about reasoning, not for ones only interested in common practice.

1 + 1 = 2, it's not that simple. It is analogous to language. We at least speak one natively, but no one has been able to tell a general rule about how it works. The most basic things are the hardest to explain. 

This book will guide you through the fundamentals of mathematics. It does not start from counting apples. It does not start from learning multiplication tables. It starts from logic, and logic will be our king, friend and tool throughout this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h2&gt;Class and ID Selectors&lt;/h2&gt;
Use shorthand syntax for classes and longhand syntax for IDs to avoid setting unnecessary defaults and simplify debugging of dynamic class changes through scripting or property changes through pseudo-classes

&lt;h2&gt;Background Property Shorthand&lt;/h2&gt;
When using shorthand to set all background properties in one declaration, use the following order for consistency and compatibility across browsers:
#background-color
#background-image
#background-repeat
#background-attachment
#horizontal position
#vertical position

Use background-image instead of the background shorthand when using ID selectors to avoid inadvertently overriding class-based background-position changes for CSS sprites

&lt;h2&gt;List-Style Shorthand&lt;/h2&gt;
Use list-style shorthand instead of list-style-type for IE6 to avoid the declaration being ignored by the CSS parser

      <text xml:space="preserve">JR - Pros, cons, Reference links, formatting, pictures.
AZ-Intro, Think First, Name, Profile, Hashtags, Letting Others Know, Resistance.

MM - This was a pretty incredible site!  I had never even considered twittering in schools before I read this, and didn't realize everything you could do.  I do like how you added a section that you can RSS feed twitter instead of having your own account.  Nice job on the site!

MN - I love how this is actually written in a real voice.  I think this is where we should go with almost all of our writing.  It is upbeat and gets the educator reading it excited to use Twitter.  I also really like how you listed the pros and cons of using twitter, although clearly from your article you guys are on the pro side:)  I would add to the Cons that shady characters can try to follow your students and there is almost no way you can prevent them from doing so (that I know of, I might be completely wrong).  Overall informative and very well written article, I thoroughly enjoyed it!

SM - The idea is great.  As Twitter becomes a constant in everyday life it is crucial for educators to be exposed to it as well.

HB - Giving suggestions on how to incorporate such a popular tool like Twitter into the classroom was a great project idea. The information you included was helpful to those considering using Twitter in the classroom and provides ideas that might even influence those against the notion to give it a shot.

JRegino: Twitter in schools, this is something I am definitely nervous about trying.  I think your book is very informative and catches on all the key points to make using Twitter in schools safe and effective.  I like the step-by-step process you gave to create a safe Twitter account for schools.  Many of the statements on the pros list I have never even thought of but they are really good.  Thank you for the information, great job!.

FS - I never considered using Twitter in this way.  Also, I never heard of a hashtag until your page.  Very informative overall.  My favorite pro is that contributors would have a character limit.  Getting to the point when posting online is crucial.  Thanks, Adam Z. and Jon R.

CH- Great info guys!  I know that twitter is becoming really popular with high school and college kids.  So this would be a great way to communicate with them, since they already use it socially.  The potential is great, but the challenges as far as school restricition and content appropriateness could be hard to deal with..

JWhiteman - great ifnormation and some great suggestions on how to incorporate this tool within the classroom.  I think it was well organized and has me thinking on bringing this source into my class

Alana - I would love to use Twitter in the classroom.  Great information.  Loved that the Pros list was longer than the Cons list.  Right now I can only have my Entrepreneurship class create a fake Twitter and demonstrate how they would use it for advertising their business or product.</text>

''&quot;Digital Storytelling is the modern expression of the ancient art of storytelling. Digital stories derive their power by weaving images, music, narrative and voice together, thereby giving deep dimension and vivid color to characters, situations, experiences, and insights. Tell your story now digitally.&quot;'''''Bold text'''
- Leslie Rule, Digital Storytelling Association

Digital Storytelling is the practice of using computer-based tools to tell stories.  Digital stories contain computer-based images, text, recorded audio narration, video clips and/or music. Digital stories can vary in length from two to ten minutes. Students can build stories from personal tales to the recounting of historical events, from exploring life in one's own community to the search for life in other corners of the universe. 

Digital Storytelling can be done on the internet through several Web 2.0 sites or through several software applications. 

'''Digital Storytelling Software Applications'''&lt;u&gt;'''text'''&lt;/u&gt;

PowerPoint is an application that has been used to tell a story or create an application. If you are using PowerPoint 2007, remember to save to a lower version of PowerPoint in order to send to another person or use the Pack and Go feature to send to anyone so that they can open and view your PowerPoint.

Photo Story is another application that is easy to use to tell a story. PhotoStory is a free download from Microsoft at [http://microsoft-photo-story.en.softonic.com/ Photostory for Windows]. You can also add voice and music to the story. The motion of the photos can create the illusion of a video. It takes a few steps to create a blank slide for credits, information, etc., in Photo Story. However, step-by-step directions ( Adding Blank Slides to a Photo Story.doc or  Adding Blank Slides to a Photo Story.pdf) showing how to insert a blank slide along with a web page to assist has been created to make this easier for the user.

A great site to see some of the Web 2.0 Applications that create digital stories is from Alan Levine. He has a wikispace that has links to over 50 sites in which he uses each site to tell the same story of his dog, Dominoe. The site is [http://cogdogroo.wikispaces.com/ CogDogRoo]. Great to see how the same story can have a different feeling due to the application used.

== Digital Storytelling  ==
Digital Storytelling is the practice of using computer-based tools to tell stories.  Digital stories contain computer-based images, text, recorded audio narration, video clips [[File:digitalstorylogo.jpg|thumb|Technology + Literacy]] and/or music. Digital stories can vary in length from two to ten minutes. Students can build stories from personal tales to the recounting of historical events, from exploring life in one's own community to the search for life in other corners of the universe. Digital Storytelling can be done on the internet through several Web 2.0 sites or through several software applications. 

=== Digital Storytelling Software Applications ===
PowerPoint is an application that has been used to tell a story or create an application. If you are using PowerPoint 2007, remember to save to a lower version of PowerPoint in order to send to another person or use the Pack and Go feature to send to anyone so that they can open and view your PowerPoint.

Great to see how the same story can have a different feeling due to the application used.
 
=== Suggestions for Implementing Digital Storytelling in the Classroom ===

* Use an audio program such as Audacity. Audio programs allow students to record sounds or narration that can later be added to their digital story&lt;br /&gt;
* Use a Green Screen program such as iMovie, Jaycut.com,  Adobe Premier, or Adobe Visual Communicator. Students can find images or video to put in the background as they tell a story of their own.&lt;br /&gt;
* Use an animation program like Moviemaker, or Tech4Learning Frames  with any type of drawing program. Students can create animated story pages to keep students interested in reading and watching the story. Students create a sequence of drawings in the designated program. Afterward, they put it together to create animation. Students can add text to the story or their own voice to tell a story.

=== Advantages of Using Digital Storytelling in Education ===
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brighthub.com/education/k-12/articles/105041.aspx accessed on August 02, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* All students can have the chance to share their story&lt;br /&gt;
* Student interest and attention is gained when real storytellers and eyewitnesses convey the material rather than simply reading it&lt;br /&gt;
* Students learn important skills such as using proper enunciation when public speaking, and the value of body language and facial expression&lt;br /&gt;

=== Disadvantages of Using Digital Storytelling in Education ===
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brighthub.com/education/k-12/articles/105041.aspx accessed on August 02, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* Requires special equipment and software that some schools may not have&lt;br /&gt;
* Can be time consuming&lt;br /&gt;
* Students work may be overwhelmed by the use of technology in some cases where the focus is more on technology and not on the material&lt;br /&gt;
* Students and teachers must have knowledge regarding intellectual property and copyright issues &lt;ref&gt;http://teachnology.pbworks.com/f/7+things+digital+storytelling.pdf accessed on August 02, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assessing Digital Storytelling Projects ===
Even though Digital Storytelling is fun, it still should be assessed both for academic content and for technology skills. Rubrics are commonly used to assess storybooks. As a rubric is created there are several items to keep in mind according to Jason Ohler of Digital Storytelling&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jasonohler.com/storytelling/index.cfm accessed on August 02, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;:
# Set clear goals– Provide a model or example
# Assess everything- both technology and subject area
# Assess the process- Group work and research
# Include self-assessment and peer review

Jason Ohler suggests using the following basic assessment traits&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jasonohler.com/storytelling/index.cfm accessed on August 02, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;:
* Apply your writing standards&lt;br /&gt;
* Check the story for clarity and articulation&lt;br /&gt;
* Check that research is clear and thorough
* Evaluate digital craftmanship
* Determine if assigned criteria was met
* Determine if media mechanics were applied
* Evaluate the level of creativity and originality in the project

With the effort and time put into such a project, students and teachers should take time to reflect on the outcome.

'''Comments'''

MW- I really enjoyed the page. It was informative and I liked the Do's and Don't section. It was clear and easy to follow for beginners.

JR- I liked the site. I wish this was around when I had to create my podcast for a class. I love the host site section, it would be very helpful to someone who needs to create one! Good job!

SJ- This is a great page for people new to podcasting. I like that you explain what hardware and software are needed. You gave some really great podcast examples as well.

JRegino: This is great information!  The content about software and hosts sites is very useful and makes it very easy for beginners to get started.  The do’s and don’ts for podcasting also really good and makes a great checklist for students creating podcast.  You did a great job with the Wikibook, it is well written and very informative.

JWhiteman - great information and a great layout.  It was very easy to follow and it made me think of how I use podcasts in my class and some great examples.

Jamie R. - Before reading this, I really wasn't 100% sure what Podcasting actually was.  Now I understand it and see what all the hype is over it.  I thought the Do's and Don'ts section was useful.  I also liked the introduction with the background information.

Andrew W. - This can be a valuable tool for including struggling readers in some higher-content classes. They can access content in an audio format. Thanks for your research! 

DarenG- This site is well put together.  I like the podcasts Do's and Don't's.  The educational example sites are also a great resource.

Amanda R. - I think the part about students knowing they could have a large listening audience gives them a great incentive to make positive contributions to podcasts. [[Special:Contributions/67.165.9.90|67.165.9.90]] ([[User talk:67.165.9.90|discuss]]) 16:36, 3 March 2013 (UTC)

Tiffany S. - You guys did a nice job organizing this website.  It is easy to use, and has some useful info (Do's and Don'ts, examples of podcasts, how to subscribe and unsubscribe, etc.).  Like you said above, podcasts would be a great resource for students who benefit from auditory input.</text>

SJ completed the advantages and disadvantages section. She transferred all of the information and images onto the wikibook page. MW researched and wrote the information for remaining sections on the wikipage. She created the images for the page. MW added reference section.

==Comments==

AZ-I found this book to be extremely well done. It was very well done, easy to follow and understand. A great resource for teachers. Well Done!

SM - great page.  I appreciate the con that noted how technology for creating a digital story may be at times overwhelming and therefore over shine the actual knowledge of the student.

HB - Great page. I like that you added an area &quot;Suggestions for Implementing Digital Storytelling in the Classroom.&quot;

JR- I really like this page. I never really heard about Digital Storytelling, but I think it is a neat idea. My favorite part is that you include a rubric for using this in a classroom! Great job!

FS - I love this topic.  My first and only exposure to digital storytelling was by way of PhotoStory.  Now I have a great resource to use and expand my knowledge.  Thank you, Melissa and Sabrina.

JW - great page.  It was well done and easy to follow and understand.

GI - I like this page a lot. Digital storytelling is a great way for students who may not be &quot;artists&quot; in the traditional sense a chance to express their creativity.

JN- I think you did a really great job on covering Digital Storytelling. You supplied great links as additional resources.</text>

== What are Educational Videogames? ==
It is important to distinguish between educational and edutainment games prior to proceeding with a review focused on educational video game design. According to Denis and Jouvelot (2005), “The main characteristic that differentiates edutainment and video games is interactivity, because, the former being grounded on didactical and linear progressions, no place is left to wandering and alternatives” (p. 464). Edutainment games, then, are those which follow a skill and drill format in which players either practice repetitive skills or rehearse memorized facts. As such, “Edutainment often fails in transmitting non trivial (or previously assimilated) knowledge, calling again and again the same action patterns and not throwing the learning curve into relief” (Denis &amp; Jouvelot, 2005, p. 464). In contrast, educational video games require strategizing, hypothesis testing, or problem-solving, usually with higher order thinking rather than rote memorization or simple comprehension. Characteristics of such games include a system of rewards and goals which motivate players, a narrative context which situates activity and establishes rules of engagement, learning content that is relevant to the narrative plot, and interactive cues that prompt learning and provide feedback.

Educational video games are sometimes referred to as ‘edutainment’ in the industry. Experts believe that these games make learning fun by using entertainment as an educational tool. These games take a specific type of learning or topic and build a game around that topic. For example, kids might learn math by playing a flying game. The hope is that the child will have fun and forget that they’re learning, but still maintain the knowledge they pick up while playing. 
Children’s educational games differ from adult games of the same type because they’re typically more basic and cover fewer concepts. An adult game may teach several ideas at once, such as Democracy, which teaches adults about elections, politics, and other issues. A child’s game usually takes only one topic, such as math or reading, and focuses the teaching on that one idea.
There are different types of games available: those that are played online, those on a computer, and those on a handheld device. The Leapster company is one of the leaders in handheld games, with their first system designed to help kids learn to read. The books let the kids read along and touch the screen to hear words spoken. They now make similar systems to teach kids other subjects such as math and science. There are even video games meant for consoles like the Nintendo Wii and XBOX 360. 

Even though these types of games designed for consoles are popular in the home, they are less common in the classroom.  The main reason for this is the lack of educational software that coincides with school curriculum.  Because of this, PCs are primarily used to implement educational video games in the school setting.  A growing trend is using handheld consoles as learning technology.  These types of educational video games are becoming more popular in the school setting because they are portable, simple to use, robust, and inexpensive.  A major advantage of handheld consoles is that they can easily connect to each other and offer multiplayer gaming options.  This opens the door to possible small group interactions (Kirriemuir, 2002).

== History and Research==
Research in gaming has been conducted since the 1970’s but focusing on the educational purposes of gaming did not start until the 1980’s.  After the 1980’s educational gaming research focused on psychological effects, motivational effects, and core educational potential (Clark &amp; Ernst, 2009).  According to the article “Gaming Research for Technology Education” by Aaron C. Clark and Jeremy Ernst in 2009 gaming was a 9 billion dollar a year industry (recently gaming profits have fallen).  The article also states that 65 percent of all American households play both video and computer games.  94 percent of all computer games are played by those under the age of 18.  Also listed as a statistic is that 63 percent of parents believe gaming has positive educational effect on their children.

== What are the Benefits? ==
=== 21st Century Skills ===
In a historical review of the research on video game design, Aguilera and Mendiz (2003) maintained that, “arguments in favor of the cognitive importance of video games are based on a number of studies indicating that many video games are conducive to the development of specific skills: attention, spatial concentration, problem-solving, decision-making, collaborative work, creativity, and, of course, ICT skills” (p.8). Many of these skills are earmarked as necessary to successfully participate in the global, knowledge based economy of the 21st Century. Employing cursory case studies of specific games and anecdotal comments from young video game players as evidence of his assertions, Prensky (2006) contrasted the nature of digital immigrants (those who have recently migrated to the use of digital technology) to that of digital natives (those who have grown up with it). Although Prensky is not an educational researcher, he is a widely acclaimed speaker and writer on how complex video games teach digital natives in ways not offered by traditional instruction. The most significant of his ideas include his description of complex videos games and the 21st Century skills that game play can impart learning augmented with game-like design features can indeed encourage the development of modern skills. Since Schrier’s research did not employ an experimental design comparing the augmented reality treatment to a control group, generalizations about learning gains in the game-like environment over a traditional classroom were not supported by the study.

=== Deduction and Hypothesis Testing ===
The results of a variety of studies suggest that video games and game-like environments are conducive to deductive reasoning and hypothesis testing (Aguilera &amp; Mendiz, 2003; Gee, 2003; Jenkins et al., 2003; Klopfer &amp; Yoon, 2005; Lunce, 2006; Salzman, Dede, &amp; Loftin, 1999; Salzman et al., 1996). In a qualitative analysis of both what and how students learned playing Civilization III in an interdisciplinary history, humanities, and social studies course, Squire and Barab (2004) found that game play promoted deep learning, hypothesis testing, strategizing, and appropriating content (history, in this case) as a tool for play. Squire, Barnett, Grant and Higginbotham (2004) established that students in an experimental group who played the simulation-game Supercharged! better mastered the abstract and conceptual knowledge related to electromagnetism than those in the control group who learned through guided discovery-based science methods. The researchers attributed these learning gains to replay for testing new hypotheses afforded by the simulation game.

=== Complex Concepts and Abstract Thinking === 
Other studies concurred with the findings of Squire, Barnett, Grant, and Higginbotham (2004) concerning mastery of abstract and conceptual knowledge through game play (Aguilera &amp; Mendiz, 2003; Gee, 2003; Lunce, 2006; Prensky, 2006). Writing about technology in general rather than games specifically, Kelly (2005) argued that technology applications including video games promote mastery of complex concepts. In a qualitative case study of the game-like computer-modeling environment, StarLogo, Klopfer and Yoon (2005) discovered that struggling students were able to better comprehend complex systems after working with StarLogo. 

=== Differentiated Instruction ===
Educational Videogames can help meet the challenge of differentiated instruction in the classroom.  Differentiated instruction allows all students to access the same classroom curriculum by providing entry points, learning tasks, and outcomes tailored to students’ learning needs (Hall, Strangman, and Meyer, 2003).  Differentiating is responsive instruction designed to meet unique individual student needs (Watts-Taffe, Laster, Broach, Marinak, McDonald, &amp; Walker-Dalhouse, 2012).  Educational video games can meet those individual needs.  Students can play at different difficulty levels and work at a pace that benefits them.  A 2009 study of educational videogames in the classroom concluded that comparing course evaluations, student comments, and focus group data across several iterations of the class, including a traditional version that primarily consisted of direct teaching, suggests that integrating videogames into the structure of a class can help motivate learners, differentiate instruction and increase student learning (Jackson, 2009).  

=== Visual and Spatial Processing ===
Because most complex video games are situated in 2- or 3-D environments, it is no surprise that research has found increased spatial development in video game players. According to Aguilera and Mendiz (2003), “adolescents with medium- or long-term experience playing video games show greater visual capacity, motor activity, and spatial abilities-reflexes and responses” (p. 6). Using game engines to render and then explore the effects of architectural designs, Burrow and More (2005) observed that the capabilities of game-engines “allow participants to experience the spatial design in ways that are not predetermined by the designer” (p. 35). The objective of the Burrow and More project was to explore the relationship between architectural design elements and atmosphere, analyzing both the atmosphere produced by the architectural design and the impact of atmosphere on the design. Burrow and More argued that this focus “emphasizes critical thinking on the nature of space and its representation … and its interactivity” (p. 38).

== How Can Videogames be Used in Education? ==
In regards to using gaming in the classroom games can influence motivation and engagement of the learners in a positive way. Games offer a secure and contextual environment that foster different skill acquisition. A basic skill level starts with eye-hand coordination skills and continues to more complex skills such as problem solving skills, communication and collaboration skills, strategic thinking skills, and social skills. In game-like learning environment, learning by doing, active learning and experiential learning step in foreground. Educational game play allows for just in time learning; the player is introduced to rules and concepts as needed, self-paced learning, motivation of players to push the boundaries of their own knowledge and skills, and the use of different forms of visual, oral, and text for redundant information (Bryant, 2008).&lt;br /&gt;


Most researchers conceptualize learning as a multidimensional construct of learning skills, cognitive learning outcomes, such as procedural, declarative and strategic knowledge, and attitudes (Pivec, 2005). The game based learning model is used in some areas of formal education very successfully, in particular, in military, medicine, business, physical, and training. In many cases application of serious games and simulations for learning means an opportunity for learners’ to apply acquired knowledge and to experiment, get feedback in form of consequences thus getting the experiences in the “safe virtual world.”  There are specific educational domains where game-based learning concepts and approaches have a high learning value. These domains are interdisciplinary topics where skills such as critical thinking, group communication, debate and decision making are of high importance (Pivec, 2005). Such subjects, if learned in isolation, often cannot be applied in real world contexts (Pivec, 2005). &lt;br /&gt;


Seventy percent of college students played computer or console games in 2002 (Weaver, 2011).  The Pew study obliterates a few gender stereotypes about avid gamers, finding that slightly more women (60 percent) than men (40 percent) reported playing computer and online games amongst college aged gamers and about the same number of men and women play video games (Weaver, 2011).  In 2010 Paul Heydon of independent banking firm Avista Partners, an investment banker working in the game sector since 1999, came up with his best guess for the approximate value of the videogame business across the entire world (Goldman, 2010). Speaking at the UK's Edinburgh Interactive Festival 2010 this week, Heydon puts video gaming at about $105 billion worldwide (Goldman, 2010).  Nintendo DS which is most prevalent in elementary schools, this hand-held video gaming system may appear to be used solely for playing video games, but its PictoChat feature allows students to use the touch screen to draw or send text messages to anyone else with a Nintendo DS within a 30-foot radius (American Federation of Teachers, 2010).&lt;br /&gt;


There are 16 million active subscriptions to massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) worldwide (Biggs, 2010). World of Warcraft reached 12 million subscriptions in 2010 but is slowing (Woodcock, 2008).  Gazillionaire, a business strategy game used extensively by educators in grades 5–12, is ranked in the top 5 of all strategy games (LavaMind).  About 250 colleges use the game Alice to teach computer programming (AC, 2007). To date, Alice has attracted more than 3.5 million page views (AC, 2007). With half a million program downloads in 2007, students’ average grades jumped from a C to a B.  More than 100 higher-education institutions—including Harvard Law School, MIT, and Princeton University—have permanent spaces on Second Life.&lt;br /&gt;


As the written word provides only a limited representation of a pictorial cyberspace, the best way to grasp the possibilities of avatar technology is to see either The Matrix or The Thirteenth Floor. These movies depict fully realized avatar worlds inhabited by computer users whose neural interfaces connect them to networks with terabit/second processing speeds. While the users’ bodies are plugged in and at rest, their digital representatives (i.e., avatars) roam through wholly realistic, multi-sensorial cyberspaces. They encounter other avatars as well as software agents (&quot;bots&quot;) programmed to make decisions and interact with humans. Though science fiction, these films extrapolate current practices and trends and provide a vision that serious people (e.g., the MIT Media Lab, Cornell University’s Theory Center, the Digital Human Group) are working to realize (Foreman, 1999).&lt;br /&gt;


Consider the educational value of such an experience. Based in a 3D pictorial space, a the learning environment is visually stimulating, is self-paced to suit the speed and learning inclinations of the visitor, and can be enhanced with embedded media (from text to video). Add avatars, and the 3D experience becomes an expansive adventure in social computing. Avatars98, the first virtual conference of the Contact Consortium, produced by Bruce Damer (the leading authority on avatar worlds), the conference connected global locations, provided an exhibit hall, featured &quot;speakers,&quot; and was attended by 4000 people and all of this took place (so to speak) on the computer screens of the thousands of geo-distributed individuals whose avatars came together in the virtual conference hall (Foreman, 1999).&lt;br /&gt;


One study by psychologists at the University of Rochester found that players actually derive a sense of achievement, freedom and social connectedness from games.  &quot;Video games are not a frivolous expenditure of your time,&quot; says Dr. James Rosser Jr., director of Beth Israel Medical Center's Advanced Medical Technology Institute and a gamer since the advent of Pong in the early '70s (Van Dusen, 2007). &lt;br /&gt;


&quot;They have an upside if properly utilized.&quot;  Rosser set out to prove there's more to the hobby than fun by looking at the correlation between gaming and the laparoscopic surgical skills of 21 surgical residents and 12 surgeons during a simulated surgery skills course. In laparoscopy, surgeons insert a viewing tube with a camera via a small incision to examine organs on a video monitor. They can insert instruments through other incisions to perform procedures. The study's results would make any gamer smile.  Current players made 32% fewer errors, were 24% faster and scored 26% better overall than their non-player colleagues, according to the paper published in February's Archives of Surgery. But surgeons who'd played games in the past for more than three hours a week came out on top. They made 37% fewer errors, were 27% faster and scored 42% better overall than those who'd never played. (Van Dusen, 2007) Research under way by the Office of Naval Research indicates that video games can help adults process information much faster and improve their fundamental abilities to reason and solve problems in novel contexts. &lt;br /&gt;


&quot;We have discovered that video game players perform 10 to 20 percent higher in terms of perceptual and cognitive ability than normal people that are non-game players,&quot; said Ray Perez, a program officer at the ONR's warfighter performance department in a January 20th interview on Pentagon Web Radio's audio webcast &quot;Armed with Science: Research and Applications for the Modern Military.&quot; Perez used the term &quot;fluid intelligence&quot; to describe the ability to change, to meet new problems and to develop new tactics and counter-tactics. Fluid intelligence, he explained, allows us to solve problems without prior knowledge or experience.  (Freeman, 2010)&lt;br /&gt;


This raises the question of whether fluid intelligence is innate or can be developed and improved.  &quot;For the last 50 years, fluid intelligence was felt to be immutable,&quot; Perez said, &quot;meaning it couldn't be changed, no matter what kinds of experiences you have.&quot; This, he added, is related to the idea of brain plasticity (Freeman, 2010). &quot;The presumption was that the structure of the brain and the organization of the brain are pretty much set in concrete by the time you are out of your teens,&quot; he explained (Freeman, 2010). It once was widely believed that after the age of 20 that most humans had achieved their brain cell capacity, and that new brain cells were acquired at the expense of existing ones. But conventional beliefs about brain plasticity and aging are changing. The video game-like training programs at the Office of Naval Research, Perez noted, are producing surprising results. “We know that video games can increase perceptual abilities and short-term memory,” he said (Freeman, 2010). They allow the player to focus longer and expand the player’s field of vision compared to people who don’t play video games, he added. While there is empirical evidence of increased brain plasticity in video gamers, Perez said, the process behind it is not well understood. His belief, he said, is that the neural networks involved in video gaming become more pronounced, have increased blood flow, and become more synchronized with other neural networks in the brain (Freeman, 2010).  &lt;br /&gt;


“Video games are hard,’’ said Eric Klopfer, the director of MIT’s Education Arcade, which studies and develops educational video games. “People don’t like to play easy games, and games have figured out a way to encourage players to persist at solving challenging problems.’’  The games aren’t just hard - they’re adaptively hard. They tend to challenge people right at the edge of their abilities; as players get better and score more points, they move up to more demanding levels of play. This adaptive challenge is “stunningly powerful’’ for learning, said John Gabrieli, a neuroscientist at MIT.  Most games involve a huge number of mental tasks, and playing can boost any one of them. Fast-paced, action-packed video games have been shown, in separate studies, to boost visual acuity, spatial perception, and the ability to pick out objects in a scene. &lt;br /&gt;


Complex, strategy-based games can improve other cognitive skills, including working memory and reasoning.  Richard Haier, a pediatric neurologist and professor emeritus at the School of Medicine at the University of California at Irvine, has shown in a pair of studies that the classic game Tetris, in which players have to rotate and direct rapidly falling blocks, alters the brain (Anthes, 2009). In a paper published last month, Haier and his colleagues showed that after three months of Tetris practice, teenage girls not only played the game better, their brains became more efficient (Anthes, 2009).

== Difficulties of Design ==

Building effectives games that promote interactivity, while still maintaining a link to the curricular goals is a continuing problem for educational videogames.  Games allow students to engage content on a variety of levels.  Students can take the role of the ‘performer,’ making direct actions in the game, ‘audience,’ watching what is going on during the game, and the ‘author’ deciding what will go next in the game.  This ability to engage on different levels allows students to enhance their learning experience, but also requires serious thought and complex design (Apperley, 2010).    

=== Advanced Students ===
Research shows that low performing students benefit from games, but the research is more inconclusive when studying high achieving students.  Designing games to meet the complex needs to advanced thinkers is a difficult and expensive proposition that few companies or institutions are willing to invest in (Gros, 2007).  Combining videogames and a STEM curriculum can enhance the learning experience for many high achieving students.  For examples check out the following websites: http://www.gaming2learn.org/ and http://www.hofstra.edu/Academics/Colleges/SOEAHS/CTL/SMTE/index.html.  Hofstra University (second link) states: Simulation and Modeling in Technology Education (SMTE) is a five-year project that develops and researches the academic potential of a hybrid instructional model that infuses computer simulations, modeling, and educational gaming into middle school technology education programs. These prototypical materials use 3D simulations and educational gaming to support students learning STEM content and skills through developing solutions to design challenges. The virtual environment allows students to analyze and improve their designs by changing variables and observing how their changes affect design performance. Once the designs are optimized on-screen, students will construct physical models and compare their functionality and effectiveness to the simulated virtual models. A uniqueness of the project is the development of an enterprise architecture that enables instructors to modify the context of the design problems to fit different instructional and geographic settings. The research investigates the transferability of the model and its potential to improve STEM teaching and learning.

=== Teachers ===
Teachers who struggle using technology are often hesitant to utilize videogames in the classroom.  Most educational videogames are designing by programmers, not educators which also adds to the insecurity teachers feel when using videogames.  Teachers often struggle to identify videogames that meaningfully tie into their curriculum goals as well (Gros, 2007).


Cloud is as part of a community of educators who love gaming and want to share that passion to help students learn.  Have you used Google Docs, Evernote, or Dropbox? If so, you've experienced Cloud Computing, which refers to using services or applications online, instead of using programs installed on your computer.  The best games, whether digital or physical, motivates students to learn.  Digital learning and mobile devices are shaking up how everybody learns.

Our challenges will not be technological; rather they will be cultural, organizational, and economical. Culturally, teachers will need to learn new habits and structures for teaching and learning. It's hard to unlearn a lifetime of carrying textbooks, notebooks, using lockers, and transferring paperwork back and forth. Schools will need a lot of support and professional development to learn new ways. Students who were not effective with the old system may not necessarily be more effective with the new. 

Organizationally, teachers build systems and careers on specific structures and technologies. It will take time for consensus to decide which cloud technology should be adapted. Old technologies will not be replaced easily or quickly. Several legal issues like student confidentiality and data concerns will need to be worked out. 

And will educators teach any differently to maximize the benefits of these technologies? If those challenges weren't enough, the final challenge will be economic. Educators are always concerned about the &quot;digital divide&quot; and the unintended consequences when schools nationwide do not receive equitable funding and resources, resulting in &quot;have's&quot; and &quot;have nots.&quot;
Yet, if the past is any indicator of how technology innovations are adopted, some communities of educators and students will continue moving forward with new technologies, regardless of the &quot;have nots.&quot;  And in that sense, we will have some schools moving in the Cloud that will benefit from this ubiquitous access to applications and resources (Helmes, 2013).

== Education Outside of the Classroom ==

The United States Military has used a variety of videogame simulations to both recruit and train soldiers.  The widely acclaimed America’s Army was used as a major recruitment tool for the US military.  It sought to allow potential soldiers to experience realistic combat as a way of enticing potential recruits.  The game was followed by two sequels.  The Army has also followed up with the opening of the Army Experience Center in Franklin Mills Philadelphia.  The center has simulators which allow participants to experience a more engrossing combat environment.  These investments were all credited with increasing the military’s recruitment numbers. (Orvis, 2010)


The military also commissioned several games as ways of training troops for squad combat.  The VBS 1, designed by Bohemia Interactive, was utilized as a squad based training for the US Marine Crops, as well as several other services and countries.  The VBS 1 was followed up by the VBS 2 in 2009 (Robeson 2009).  One major use of the new gaming engine was to allow troops to train for a convoy ambush in Iraq.  The military has also designed several games to simulate experiences soldiers might have in both Iraqi and Afghanistan towns that allow for both diplomatic engagement as well as combat.

== Future of Educational Videogames ==
On June 21, 2007, the MacArthur Foundation, the people who give out the genius grants, announced it is funding a new public school in New York. The school is going to be for sixth through 12th graders, and the curriculum for the whole school will center on designing video games. The MacArthur Foundation is throwing its support and $1.1 million behind a new idea about what it means to be literate in the 21st century (Norris, Block, &amp; Chaplin, 2007, June, 21). It's called gaming literacy&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
What hinders teachers in regards to using gaming in the classroom?  Inflexibility of the curriculum, negative effects of gaming, student’s un-readiness, lack of supportive materials, fixed class schedules, and limited budgets are the 6 biggest culprits according to Young Kyun Baek, Ph.D. Department of Educational Technology, Korea National University of Education, Chungbuk, Republic of Korea (Baek, 2008).&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
It is important to remember that no technology is perfect. No technology will satisfy all nine rules. However, some technologies will satisfy more rules than others, and some technologies will even break a rule or two and still be very good technologies (Downes, 2000).

[[File:A leaning child's view through a skyscraper's window and glass floor.jpg|250px|thumb|left|View from a skyscraper. As long as the background is static and sufficiently far away, it is a good candidate for a skybox.]]
This tutorial covers the rendering of '''environment maps as backgrounds''' with the help of cube maps.

It is based on {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Reflecting Surfaces}}. If you haven't read that tutorial, this would be a very good time to read it.

===Rendering a Skybox in the Background===
As explained in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Reflecting Surfaces}}, a skybox can be thought of as an infinitely large, textured box that surrounds a scene. Sometimes, skyboxes (or skydomes) are implemented by sufficiently large textured models, which approximate an infinitely large box (or dome). However, {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Reflecting Surfaces}} introduced the concept of a cube map, which actually represents an infinitely large box; thus, we don't need the approximation of a box or a dome of limited size. Instead, we can render any screen-filling model (it doesn't matter whether it is a box, a dome, or an apple tree as long as it covers the whole background), compute the view vector from the camera to the rasterized surface point in the vertex shader (as we did in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Reflecting Surfaces}}) and then perform a lookup in the cube map with this view vector (instead of the reflected view vector in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Reflecting Surfaces}}) in the fragment shader:
{{clear}}
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         #ifdef FRAGMENT
 
         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = textureCube(_Cube, viewDirection);
         }
 
         #endif
&lt;/source&gt;
For best performance we should, of course, render a model with only a few vertices and each pixel should be rasterized only once. Thus, rendering the inside of a cube that surrounds the camera (or the whole scene) is fine.

===Complete Shader Code===
The shader should be attached to a material, which should be attached to a cube that surrounds the camera. In the shader code, we deactivate writing to the depth buffer with &lt;code&gt;ZWrite Off&lt;/code&gt; such that no objects are occluded by the skybox. (See the description of the depth test in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Per-Fragment Operations}}.) Front-face culling is activated with &lt;code&gt;Cull Front&lt;/code&gt; such that only the “inside” of the cube is rasterized. (See {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Cutaways}}.) The line &lt;code&gt;Tags { &quot;Queue&quot; = &quot;Background&quot; }&lt;/code&gt; instructs Unity to render this pass before other objects are rendered. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
Shader &quot;GLSL shader for skybox&quot; {
   Properties {
      _Cube (&quot;Environment Map&quot;, Cube) = &quot;&quot; {}
   }
   SubShader {
      Tags { &quot;Queue&quot; = &quot;Background&quot; }
      
      Pass {   
         ZWrite Off
         Cull Front

         GLSLPROGRAM
 
         // User-specified uniform
         uniform samplerCube _Cube;   
 
         // The following built-in uniforms 
         // are also defined in &quot;UnityCG.glslinc&quot;, 
         // i.e. one could #include &quot;UnityCG.glslinc&quot; 
         uniform vec3 _WorldSpaceCameraPos; 
            // camera position in world space
         uniform mat4 _Object2World; // model matrix
 
         // Varying
         varying vec3 viewDirection;
 
         #ifdef VERTEX
 
         void main()
         {            
            mat4 modelMatrix = _Object2World;
 
            viewDirection = vec3(modelMatrix * gl_Vertex 
               - vec4(_WorldSpaceCameraPos, 1.0));
 
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
 
         #endif
 
 
         #ifdef FRAGMENT
 
         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = textureCube(_Cube, viewDirection);
         }
 
         #endif
 
         ENDGLSL
      }
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Shader Code for Unity's Skybox System===
The shader above illustrates how to render a skybox by rendering a cube around the camera with a specific shader. This is a very general approach. Unity, however, has its own skybox system that doesn't require any game object: you just specify the material with the skybox shader in the main menu '''Edit &gt; Render Settings &gt; Skybox Material''' and Unity takes care of the rest. Unfortunately, we cannot use our shader for this system since we have to do the lookup in the cube texture at the position that is specified by the vertex texture coordinates. This is actually easier than computing the view direction. Here is the code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
Shader &quot;GLSL shader for skybox&quot; {
   Properties {
      _Cube (&quot;Environment Map&quot;, Cube) = &quot;&quot; {}
   }
   SubShader {
      Tags { &quot;Queue&quot; = &quot;Background&quot; }
      
      Pass {   
         ZWrite Off
         Cull Off

         GLSLPROGRAM
 
         // User-specified uniform
         uniform samplerCube _Cube;   
  
         // Varying
         varying vec3 texCoords;
 
         #ifdef VERTEX
 
         void main()
         {            
            texCoords = (vec3)gl_MultiTexCoord0;
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
 
         #endif
 
 
         #ifdef FRAGMENT
 
         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = textureCube(_Cube, texCoords);
         }
 
         #endif
 
         ENDGLSL
      }
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
As mentioned above, you should create a material with this shader and drag the material to '''Edit &gt; Render Settings &gt; Skybox Material'''. There is no need to attach the material to any game object.

===Summary===
Congratulations, you have reached the end of another tutorial! We have seen:
*How to render skyboxes.
*How to render skyboxes in Unity without game objects.

===Further Reading===
If you still want to know more 
* about cube maps and reflections of skyboxes in objects, you should read {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Reflecting Surfaces}}.
* about lighting that is consistent with a skybox, you should read {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Many Light Sources}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mike M - I have begun to use skype as a tool to speak with future students all over the United States.

Jamie R - I never thought of using Skype as a way to talk to people all over the world.  What a great way to do 21st century &quot;pen pals.&quot;

Tiffany S. - I had no clue there were resources like virtual field trips in Skype.  One of the ways that I have used skype in the classroom (just for fun) is to allow the kids to speak with our exchange student from last year, who is from Italy.  I really liked all the educational advantages that you guys put in.

Amanda R. I contributed to the section about the educational advantages of Skype. 

Jessica S- Kim, I found the educational advantages you added to this page to be very useful.  I do believe this should be incorporated more often into the classroom setting.  Great job!

I liked the educational advantages of Skype with suggestions on how to use it in the classroom.  DarenG

Kim S.- I contributed a couple of the educational advantages we added for using skype.  I placed our information in a one page, APA formatted paper. I also submitted it in the dropbox.  Lastly I added our information to the skype wiki page.[[Special:Contributions/64.134.68.172|64.134.68.172]] ([[User talk:64.134.68.172|discuss]]) 23:20, 2 March 2013 (UTC)     
Becky G - Thanks for your comments about the educational advantages of using SKYPE. I like the idea of speaker visits (author visits), which is something I could use in my own classroom. I also can see that perhaps I could go to a location and give my students a virtual field trip through the SKYPE tool. I possibly could hold office hours on SKYPE also. Thanks for your work! [[User:Beckywish|Beckywish]] ([[User talk:Beckywish|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beckywish|contribs]]) 21:03, 2 March 2013 (UTC)

Andrew W. - You listed some practical ideas for using Skype. I'm hoping to use Skype to do a classroom video conference with another class across the ocean. Our students have been pen pals, and I thought it would be fun to have an end-of-year Skype conference. Our time zones are close enough that it could work during the school day - morning for us and afternoon for them. Thanks for your research! ∼∼∼∼

AZ-This book is very resourceful, and useful. Excellent Job!

LK- Nice job!  This has a lot of information and will be a great resource for anyone who uses educational videogames.


JR - Wow! You must have spent a lot of time creating this wiki. Great job, very detailed resource.&lt;br /&gt;


MM - This was very extensive!  I never realized just how many educational games are available.  I know they have many benefits and help students with a lot of the skills you mentioned, I just never realized the amount that was out there!  Very nice job on the page.  Look incredible!

MN - This is very impressive.  It is one of the most organized and thorough topics.  It is clear to me how interested you are in educational video games.  I think the J's topic shows how important intrinsic motivation is when working with wikis.  As a side note, who doesn't love Oregon Trail!

JR- This is a great page! There is a ton of information! i love the examples of the games you have listed. I never realized there were so many! Great Job!

SJ- You guys did a great job. I love that you started off with history, then explored the educational uses in and outside of the classroom, followed by the future of educational videogames. All of your work was validated by some excellent resources!!

FS - It's clear that you guys thoroughly explored your topic and gave each of us something to walk away with. Thanks!

JN- I think you created a very informative page on educational videogames. I especially like the long list of videogames you provided and that you broke it down based on age appropiateness.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Table of factors affecting the size of a general solution. ==

Hi,

I believe that the left-bottom cell of this table is wrong. It should be &quot;there is no such case&quot; instead of &quot;no solutions&quot;. Could someone provide an example of such a case?

For a linear system to have no solutions, it must reduce to a falsehood (like 0 = -7). In order for that to happen, its associated homogeneous system must be linear singular, but in such case the homogeneous system has infinitely many solutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Archaea==

Archaea are microbes that are more closely related to Eukaryotic cells than they are to the Bacteria (http://tolweb.org/tree/home.pages/aboutoverview.html).  Under a light microscope, they visually resemble Bacteria, so that it wasn't until the advent of the use of molecular methods in evolutionary biology that they were recognized as belonging to their own Domain (a phylogenetic grouping above the level of Kingdom).  Archaea have ultrastructural features that are superficially similar to those in Bacteria but are usually comprised of distinctive molecules. They do, for example, have a cell wall, yet that cell wall never contains peptidoglycan.  Instead, peptidoglycan is a unique molecular signature of the Bacteria.  Archaea also have odd lipids in their cell membranes.  They were originally discovered living in extreme environments thought to resemble conditions on early earth, but now that microbiologists have become more adept at detecting them, it is clear that the Archaea are not confined to extreme habitats and can instead be found everywhere.   It is true that some Archaea are &quot;extremophiles,&quot; found in extremely salty or hot environments, but there are also extremophile Bacteria and even some very unusual extremophile Eukarya.  The best-understood groups of Archaea are:
# ''Methanogens'' use Carbon dioxide and Hydrogen to make Methane. They are found in sewage, cows, and swamps, and they do not take in oxygen.  
# ''Extreme Halophiles'' live in extremely salty places (i.e.:  the dead sea and great salt lake).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Bacteria == 

Bacteria are prokaryotes, which means they are unicellular and have no nucleus. They come in various shapes: rodlike, spherical or spiral. Bacteria are very small. A typical one is only several micrometres in size. 1 billion could fit on 1 square centimeter of space on the human gums, and 1 gram of digested food has 10 billion bacteria. 

Because they are such small organisms, light microscopes can only let us see their shape, and how they move. Under an electron microscope, we can see the details of their external parts and perhaps a blurred center due to their genetic material not being within a nucleus. 

Bacteria have a cell wall that can be either thick or thin. The chemical test, the Gram Staining technique, can help a researcher to determine this characteristic for keying out and idenficaton purposes. A think-walled bacteria will appear to be purple for a positive Gram-staining, while bacteria will be pink if they are Gram-negative. 

Bacteria can have external locomotive structures called flagella or pilli. Locomotive structures are those that allow the organisms to move around in its environment.

Under ideal conditions, one bacterium duplicates itself in about 20 mins, i.e. every 20 minutes, the number of bacteria doubles. In one day, from one bacterium, it can reproduce to2^72 new organisms(which is 4,722,366,482,869,645,213,696). In one 43 hours, their population is about 2^130 organisms. One bacterium weighs about 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt;g. 2&lt;sup&gt;130&lt;/sup&gt; bacteria weighs over 6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; kg, which is the weight of the Earth!

Because they can reproduce so fast, their populations can adapt to new environments; they evolve to meet the demands of any new localized stressors. They can change so that they can use other substances as their food and can develop a resistance to antibiotics. An important note to the above calculation is it is often that those bacteria don't have enough food to reach that population. They also have a lot of enemies. They die as fast as they duplicate.

Bacteria belong to domain ''Eubacteria''

Each chapter includes the level of intended readers. One should not write too many advanced details in chapters for beginners.

You should create one 2nd level heading at the top of the lesson, so that others can edit.

==Introduction to AquaResp==
&lt;b&gt;AquaResp&lt;/b&gt; is a free open-source MS Excel based software, primarily developed for doing oxygen measurements (respirometry) on aquatic organisms (such as fish and invertebrates). The current version (v1.0) only does resting respirometry, but the next update will include the possibility of doing exercise respirometry i.e. swimming respirometry.

Developed in MS Excel with VBA, intentions with AquaResp are, that the software functions should be fully customizable for the users, so that measurements are not limited to oxygen only but could include anything where the measurement apparatus has an output as analog- or COM-port.

&lt;b&gt;AquaResp&lt;/b&gt; is utilizing the [http://www.mccdaq.com/usb-data-acquisition/USB-1208LS.aspx USB-1208LS] and [http://www.mccdaq.com/daq-software/universal-library.aspx Universal Library] for the analog measurements, and they are therefore prerequisites for the analog part of AquaResp to function. The COM-port communications library used is the one by [http://dev.emcelettronica.com/serial-port-communication-excel-vba brumbarchris.]

&lt;b&gt;AquaResp&lt;/b&gt; were started in collaboration between National Institute of Aquatic Resources, Technical University of Denmark, and the Marine Biological Section, Department of Biology, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.

In case you forgot, cells have their genetic instructions stored in DNA molecules. These molecules can be either 'covered' or not. This cover is called nucleus. Procaryotes don't have a nucleus, whereas, eucaryotes have one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Mitochondria ==

[[File:Mitochondria,_mammalian_lung_-_TEM.jpg| thumb | Two mitochondria from mammalian lung tissue displaying their matrix and membranes as shown by electron microscopy ]]

[[File:Animal_mitochondrion_diagram_en_(edit).svg|400px| thumb]]

Mitochondria (singular mitochondrion) are the 'electric generators' of cells. They take oxygen and produce carbon dioxide together with ATP, the fuel of most of the activities of the cell. Because they take oxygen and release CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it is easy to think they 'breathe'. In fact, this process has its own name very similar to breathing, ''cellular respiration'' - the respiration of cell.

A mitochondrion is covered by two layers (membranes). The outer is smooth and round. The inner is folded many times to allow maximum area possible for cellular respiration. In this inner membrane, many proteins essential for cellular respiration are present.

== How scientists know its characteristics ==

A mitochondrion is about few micrometres in diameter. Although it is possible to see them under a light microscope, there is no way to tell what they do while they are in the cell.

So the scientists break up the cell, put its parts into a centrifuge (a spinning device in which different substances are separated, i.e. heavier objects lie further from the centre). When they have isolated our mitochondrion, they perform many chemical reactions on it to see what it can do. And they find it takes oxygen, produces carbon dioxide and ATPs! Some eukaryotes lacking mitochondria cannot consume oxygen. They even find this substance deadly.

== Secrets discovered recently==

Mitochondria are a power plants in our cell because they programme cell death. Mitochondria are also involved in signal transduction network; respond to signals from outside and emit signals themselves. Several facts have been discovered recently. First, DNA of mitochondrial code is unusual.Their DNA can be replicated, transcribed, and goes to form nucleoids. Second, Mitochondria and nuclei can communicate with each other. Nucleus communicates with mitochondria by imported proteins but still it isn't discovered how mitochondria responds back to the nucleus. Third, mitochondrion relocates protein. Inter membrane space of mitochondrial can oxidize disulphide bridges from sulfhydryl groups even though surrounded environment is highly reduced. The free energy of ATP shocks protein from mitochondrial 70-kDa heat, and it hydrolysis to move proteins across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Fourth, mitochondria can be divided and fused by machines, some proteins. Every two mitochondrial membranes have their own shape changing machine to divide and fuse by itself. Last, our body still has maternally inherited from mitochondria DNA. Mitochondria specializes its energy and DNA of mitochondria are maternal. Mitochondrial DNA that uniparental inheritance helps to ensure avoidance  harmful mutation to encoded subunits; oxidative phosphorylation system letting co-optimized by adaptive mutation from nuclear encoded partner subunits.There are much more scientific insights to be made about Mitochondria.

== The journey of evolution ==

If you still remember, we have said that mitochondrion(ancestry) used to be cells. At some time ago, there might have been a bacterium 'mitochondrion' migrating to a eukaryote. Mitochondria today in fact have their own DNAs. They can duplicate themselves. This relationship in biology, two species helping each other is called ''symbiosis''.

[[File:Lost Stratosphere title.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Title screen of a movie from 1934.]]
This tutorial covers '''screen overlays''', which are also known as “GUI Textures” in Unity.

It is the first tutorial of a series of tutorials on non-standard vertex transformations, which deviate from the standard vertex transformations that are described in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}. This particular tutorial uses texturing as described in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Textured Spheres}} and blending as described in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Transparency}}.

===Unity's GUI Textures===
There are many applications for screen overlays (i.e. GUI textures in Unity's terminology), e.g. titles as in the image {{Hide in print|to the left}}{{Only in print|below}}, but also other GUI (graphical user interface) elements such as buttons or status information. The common feature of these elements is that they should always appear on top of the scene and never be occluded by any other objects. Neither should these elements be affected by any of the camera movements. Thus, the vertex transformation should go directly from object space to screen space. Unity's GUI textures allow us to render this kind of element by rendering a texture image at a specified position on the screen. This tutorial tries to reproduce the functionality of GUI textures with the help of shaders. Usually, you would still use GUI textures instead of such a shader; however, the shader allows for a lot more flexibility since you can adapt it in any way you want while GUI textures only offer a limited set of possibilities. (For example, you could change the shader such that the GPU spends less time on rasterizing the triangles that are occluded by an opaque GUI texture.)

===Simulating GUI Textures with a GLSL Shader===
The position of Unity's GUI textures is specified by an &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt; coordinate of the lower, left corner of the rendered rectangle in pixels with &lt;math&gt;(0,0)&lt;/math&gt; at the center of the screen and a &lt;code&gt;Width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Height&lt;/code&gt; of the rendered rectangle in pixels. To simulate GUI textures, we use similar shader properties:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
   Properties {
      _MainTex (&quot;Texture&quot;, Rect) = &quot;white&quot; {}
      _Color (&quot;Color&quot;, Color) = (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
      _X (&quot;X&quot;, Float) = 0.0
      _Y (&quot;Y&quot;, Float) = 0.0
      _Width (&quot;Width&quot;, Float) = 128
      _Height (&quot;Height&quot;, Float) = 128
   }
&lt;/source&gt;
and the corresponding uniforms
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         uniform sampler2D _MainTex;
         uniform vec4 _Color;
         uniform float _X;
         uniform float _Y;
         uniform float _Width;
         uniform float _Height;
&lt;/source&gt;
For the actual object, we could use a mesh that consists of just two triangles to form a rectangle. However, we can also just use the default cube object since back-face culling (and culling of triangles that are degenerated to edges) allows us to make sure that only two triangles of the cube are rasterized. The corners of the default cube object have coordinates &lt;math&gt;-0.5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;+0.5&lt;/math&gt; in object space, i.e., the lower, left corner of the rectangle is at &lt;math&gt;(-0.5, -0.5)&lt;/math&gt; and the upper, right corner is at &lt;math&gt;(+0.5, +0.5)&lt;/math&gt;. To transform these coordinates to the user-specified coordinates in screen space, we first transform them to raster positions in pixels where &lt;math&gt;(0,0)&lt;/math&gt; is at the lower, left corner of the screen:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
        uniform vec4 _ScreenParams; // x = width; y = height; 
           // z = 1 + 1.0/width; w = 1 + 1.0/height
        ...
        #ifdef VERTEX

        void main()
        {    
            vec2 rasterPosition = vec2(
               _X + _ScreenParams.x / 2.0 
               + _Width * (gl_Vertex.x + 0.5),
               _Y + _ScreenParams.y / 2.0 
               + _Height * (gl_Vertex.y + 0.5));
            ...
&lt;/source&gt;
This transformation transforms the lower, left corner of the front face of our cube from &lt;math&gt;(-0.5, -0.5)&lt;/math&gt; in object space to the raster position &lt;code&gt;vec2(_X + _ScreenParams.x / 2.0, _Y + _ScreenParams.y / 2.0)&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;_ScreenParams.x&lt;/code&gt; is the screen width in pixels and &lt;code&gt;_ScreenParams.y&lt;/code&gt; is the height in pixels. The upper, right corner is transformed from &lt;math&gt;(+0.5, +0.5)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;code&gt;vec2(_X + _ScreenParams.x / 2.0 + _Width, _Y + _ScreenParams.y / 2.0 + _Height)&lt;/code&gt;. Raster positions are convenient and, in fact, they are often used in OpenGL; however, they are not quite what we need here.

The output of the vertex shader in &lt;code&gt;gl_Position&lt;/code&gt; is in the so-called “clip space” as discussed in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}. The GPU transforms these coordinates to normalized device coordinates between &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; by dividing them by the fourth coordinate &lt;code&gt;gl_Position.w&lt;/code&gt; in the perspective division. If we set this fourth coordinate to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, this division doesn't change anything; thus, we can think of the first three coordinates of &lt;code&gt;gl_Position&lt;/code&gt; as coordinates in normalized device coordinates, where &lt;math&gt;(-1,-1,-1)&lt;/math&gt; specifies the lower, left corner of the screen on the near plane and &lt;math&gt;(1,1,-1)&lt;/math&gt; specifies the upper, right corner on the near plane. (We should use the near plane to make sure that the rectangle is in front of everything else.) In order to specify any screen position in &lt;code&gt;gl_Position&lt;/code&gt;, we have to specify it in this coordinate system. Fortunately, transforming a raster position to normalized device coordinates is not too difficult:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            gl_Position = vec4(
               2.0 * rasterPosition.x / _ScreenParams.x - 1.0,
               2.0 * rasterPosition.y / _ScreenParams.y - 1.0,
               -1.0, // near plane 
               1.0 // all coordinates are divided by this coordinate
               );
&lt;/source&gt;
As you can easily check, this transforms the raster position &lt;code&gt;vec2(0,0)&lt;/code&gt; to normalized device coordinates &lt;math&gt;(-1.0, -1.0)&lt;/math&gt; and the raster position &lt;code&gt;vec2(_ScreenParams.x, _ScreenParams.y)&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(1.0, 1.0)&lt;/math&gt;, which is exactly what we need.

This is all we need for the vertex transformation from object space to screen space. However, we still need to compute appropriate texture coordinates in order to look up the texture image at the correct position. Texture coordinates should be between &lt;math&gt;0.0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1.0&lt;/math&gt;, which is actually easy to compute from the vertex coordinates in object space between &lt;math&gt;-0.5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;+0.5&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            textureCoords = 
               vec4(gl_Vertex.x + 0.5, gl_Vertex.y + 0.5, 0.0, 0.0);
               // for a cube, gl_Vertex.x and gl_Vertex.y 
               // are -0.5 or 0.5
&lt;/source&gt;
With the varying variable &lt;code&gt;textureCoords&lt;/code&gt;, we can then use a simple fragment program to look up the color in the texture image and modulate it with the user-specified color &lt;code&gt;_Color&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         #ifdef FRAGMENT

         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = 
               _Color * texture2D (_MainTex, vec2(textureCoords));
         }

         #endif
&lt;/source&gt;
That's it.

===Complete Shader Code===
If we put all the pieces together, we get the following shader, which uses the &lt;code&gt;Overlay&lt;/code&gt; queue to render the object after everything else, and uses alpha blending (see {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Transparency}}) to allow for transparent textures. It also deactivates the depth test to make sure that the texture is never occluded: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
Shader &quot;GLSL shader for screen overlays&quot; {
   Properties {
      _MainTex (&quot;Texture&quot;, Rect) = &quot;white&quot; {}
      _Color (&quot;Color&quot;, Color) = (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
      _X (&quot;X&quot;, Float) = 0.0
      _Y (&quot;Y&quot;, Float) = 0.0
      _Width (&quot;Width&quot;, Float) = 128
      _Height (&quot;Height&quot;, Float) = 128
   }
   SubShader {
      Tags { &quot;Queue&quot; = &quot;Overlay&quot; } // render after everything else

      Pass {
         Blend SrcAlpha OneMinusSrcAlpha // use alpha blending
         ZTest Always // deactivate depth test

         GLSLPROGRAM

         // User-specified uniforms
         uniform sampler2D _MainTex;

         void main()

            vec2 rasterPosition = vec2(
               _X + _ScreenParams.x / 2.0

               _Y + _ScreenParams.y / 2.0 
               + _Height * (gl_Vertex.y + 0.5));
            gl_Position = vec4(

               2.0 * rasterPosition.y / _ScreenParams.y - 1.0,

               // for a cube, gl_Vertex.x and gl_Vertex.y 
               // are -0.5 or 0.5
         }

         #endif

         #ifdef FRAGMENT

         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = 
               _Color * texture2D (_MainTex, vec2(textureCoords));
         }

         #endif

         ENDGLSL
      }
   }
} 
&lt;/source&gt;
When you use this shader for a cube object, the texture image can appear and disappear depending on the orientation of the camera. This is due to clipping by Unity, which doesn't render objects that are completely outside of the region of the scene that is visible in the camera (the view frustum). This clipping is based on the conventional transformation of game objects, which doesn't make sense for our shader. In order to deactivate this clipping, we can simply make the cube object a child of the camera (by dragging it over the camera in the '''Hierarchy View'''). If the cube object is then placed in front of the camera, it will always stay in the same relative position, and thus it won't be clipped by Unity. (At least not in the game view.)

===Changes for Opaque Screen Overlays===
Many changes to the shader are conceivable, e.g. a different blend mode or a different depth to have a few objects of the 3D scene in front of the overlay. Here we will only look at opaque overlays.

An opaque screen overlay will occlude triangles of the scene. If the GPU was aware of this occlusion, it wouldn't have to rasterize these occluded triangles (e.g. by using deferred rendering or early depth tests). In order to make sure that the GPU has any chance to apply these optimizations, we have to render the screen overlay first, by setting
 
&lt;code&gt;Tags { &quot;Queue&quot; = &quot;Background&quot; }&lt;/code&gt;

Also, we should avoid blending by removing the &lt;code&gt;Blend&lt;/code&gt; instruction. With these changes, opaque screen overlays are likely to improve performance instead of costing rasterization performance.

===Summary===
Congratulation, you have reached the end of another tutorial. We have seen:
*How to simulate GUI textures with a GLSL shader.
*How to modify the shader for opaque screen overlays.

===Further Reading===
If you still want to know more 
*about texturing, you should read {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Textured Spheres}}.
*about blending, you should read {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Transparency}}.
*about object space, screen space, clip space, normalized device coordinates, perspective division, etc., you should read the description of the standard vertex transformations in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Filter design ==

Designing a filter generally starts with the specification of its frequency response.
From this, both a transfer function and a filter structure have to be chosen.
Indeed, some filter structures such as [[Signal_Processing/Analog_Filters#Chain_of_Second_Order_Sections|chains of second order sections]] are adaptable to any filter function
whilst the basic [[Signal_Processing/Analog_Filters#Ladder_filters|ladder filter]] structure with only inductances on the series branches and capacitances on the parallel branches merely implement all-pole lowpass transfer functions.
Mapping the transfer function to the filter structure gives the element values of analog filters elements and the coefficients of digital filters.

From the ideal filter, further optimizations have to be done.

The lumped element or the coefficient values are ideal values.
Lumped element values have to be mapped to the ones of existing components.
Filter coefficients have to be rounded to values supported by the number representation of the filter circuit.
For example, choosing a fixed-point or a floating point Digital Signal Processor (DSP) will result in coarser or finer coefficient values.

Then, the signal amplitudes inside the filter have to be considered.
For active filters and digital filters, the internal signals have to be checked against saturation or overflow.
For any filter, the signals sould not become too small, because this would seriously affect the signal to noise ratio of the whole filter.
So basically, the filter design process doesn't only analyse the transfer function from the input to the output, but also the transfer function from the input to the internal signals.

== Filter representations ==

A filter can be represented in many equivalent ways:
* obviously by its [[#Transfer function|transfer function]]
* by the zeroes and poles ot the transfer function, together with a gain factor
* by the state-space representation of the filter

Methods allow to switch from one representation to the other.
The different representations cast a specific light on the filter's properties.
The transfer function, plotted for &lt;math&gt;s = j\omega&lt;/math&gt; shows how frequencies are amplified or damped.
The zero-pole plot gives a direct information about the system stability.
The state-space representation gives more insight into the chosen filter structure and allows to analyse the amplitudes of some signals (the state variables) inside the filter.

=== Transfer Function ===

The most common way to choose a transfer function for simple filters such as lowpass, highpass, bandpass or bandstop is to select a usual [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Signals_and_Systems/Filter_Implementations filter function]: Butterworth, Chebyshev, Elliptic, Bessel…

Realizable transfer functions are in the form of the quotient of two polynoms.
: &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{num(s)}{den(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

The filter order is the maximal power of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; (or of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; for sampled systems) in the two polynoms.
{{TextBox|
A 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order transfer function is in the form:
: &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{b_4 s^{4} + b_3 s^{3} + b_2 s^{2} + b_1 s + b_0}{a_4 s^{4} + a_3 s^{3} + a_2 s^{2} + a_1 s + a_0}&lt;/math&gt;
A 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order all-pole transfer function is in the form:
: &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{1}{a_4 s^{4} + a_3 s^{3} + a_2 s^{2} + a_1 s + a_0}&lt;/math&gt;
A 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order FIR transfer function is in the form:
: &lt;math&gt;H(z) = \frac{b_4 z^{4} + b_3 z^{3} + b_2 z^{2} + b_1 z + b_0}{1} = b_4 z^{4} + b_3 z^{3} + b_2 z^{2} + b_1 z + b_0&lt;/math&gt;
}}

The different filter functions try to get as close as possible to a brick-wall shape, with different optimization goals in mind.
The higher the filter order, the closest the function comes to the brick-wall shape.
Butterworth filter do this by having a maximally flat (ripple-free) transfer funtion.
Bessel functions put a special weight on keeping a constant group delay in the passband.

These transfer functions are defined for normalized lowpass filters.
[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Signals_and_Systems/Filter_Transforms Filter transformation] techniques allow to transform the lowpass function to lowpass with a desired cutoff frequency, highpass, bandpass or bandstop.

Also, the functions stand for time-continuous systems, understood with the help of the [[Signal_Processing/Fourier_Analysis#Laplace_Analysis|Laplace analysis]].
For [[Signal_Processing/Fourier_Analysis#Sampled_systems_analysis|sampled systems]], such as switched-capacitor or digital filters, a further step is needed: the &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;-based transfer function has to be transformed in a &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-based transfer function.

=== Zeroes, Poles and Gain ===

The zeroes are the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial#Solving_polynomial_equations roots] of the transfer function numerator.
The poles are the roots of the transfer function denominator.
The gain is the DC value of the transfer function: the value for &lt;math&gt;s = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The transfer function of a system given by its zeroes &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt;, poles &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and gain &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is:
: &lt;math&gt;H(s) = k \cdot \frac{\prod_{i=1}^M (s-z_i)}{\prod_{i=1}^N (s-p_i)}&lt;/math&gt;

A stable [[Signal_Processing/Fourier_Analysis#LTI_Systems|LTI system]] has all its poles on the left side half plane of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.

=== State Space Representation ===

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_space_(controls) state space representation] describes the filter as a set of differential equations:
: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \cdot \mathbf{x}(t) + B \cdot u(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y(t) = C \cdot \mathbf{x}(t) + D \cdot u(t)&lt;/math&gt;
Here, the input is &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the internal filter signals are &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and the output is &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;.
The [[Signal_Processing/Fourier_Analysis#Laplace_Analysis|Laplace transform]] of these equations is given by:
: &lt;math&gt;s \cdot \mathbf{X}(s) = A \cdot \mathbf{X}(s) + B \cdot U(s)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y(s) = C \cdot \mathbf{X}(s) + D \cdot U(s)&lt;/math&gt;

The transfer function is given by:
: &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = C(s\mathbf{I} - A)^{-1}B + D&lt;/math&gt;

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors eigenvalues] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are the poles of the system.
The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_polynomial characteristic polynomial] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the denominator of the transfer function.

== Examples ==

=== 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Order Normalized Butterworth Filter ===

&lt;div style=&quot;background: #CCEEFF; border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]] This example goes through the different representations of a 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order normalized Butterworth filter.

Contrarily to other filter functions given by polynomials, the Butterworth filter is best described by the location of its poles. It is an all-pole function: it has no zeroes.

[[File:Butterworth poles 4.svg|right|thumb|150 px|Poles of a 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order Butterworth filter]]
==== Poles ====

The normalized [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Signals_and_Systems/Filter_Implementations#Butterworth_Filters Butterworth filter] has equally spaced poles on the left half plane part of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle unit circle].
For a 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order filter, their values are:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} p_1, p_1^* = e^{\pm i (\pi / 2 + \pi / 8)} \\ p_2, p_2^* = e^{\pm i (\pi / 2 + 3 \pi / 8)} \end{cases}
or
\begin{cases} p_1, p_1^* = -0.383 \pm 0.924 \cdot i \\ p_2, p_2^* = -0.924 \pm 0.383 \cdot i \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Transfer Function ====

The transfer function is thus:
: &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{1}{(s- p_1) \cdot (s- p_1^*) \cdot (s- p_2) \cdot (s- p_2^*) }&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{1}{(s^2 - 2 \cdot re(p_1) \cdot s + 1) \cdot (s^2 - 2 \cdot re(p_2) \cdot s + 1) }&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{1}{(s^2 + 0.765 s + 1) \cdot (s^2 + 1.848 s + 1) }&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{1}{s^4 + 2.61 s^3 + 3.41 s^2 + 2.61 s +1}&lt;/math&gt;

==== State Space Representation ====

A possible state space representation is found from the transfer function:
: &lt;math&gt;Y(s) = U(s) \frac{1}{s^4 + 2.61 s^3 + 3.41 s^2 + 2.61 s +1}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;s^4 \cdot Y(s) + 2.61 s^3 \cdot Y(s) + 3.41 s^2 \cdot Y(s) + 2.61 s \cdot Y(s) + Y(s) = U(s)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;s \cdot s^3 \cdot Y(s) = - Y(s) - 2.61 s \cdot Y(s) - 3.41 s^2 \cdot Y(s) - 2.61 s^3 \cdot Y(s) + U(s)&lt;/math&gt;

Writing:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
X_1(s) =  Y(s) \\
X_2(s) = s \cdot Y(s) = s \cdot X_1(s)  \\
X_3(s) = s^2 \cdot Y(s) = s \cdot X_2(s)  \\
X_4(s) = s^3 \cdot Y(s) = s \cdot X_3(s)  \\
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

gives:
: &lt;math&gt;s \cdot X_4(s) = -  X_1(s) - 2.61 \cdot X_2(s) - 3.41 \cdot X_3(s) - 2.61 \cdot X_4(s) + U(s) &lt;/math&gt;

This can be rewritten in matrix form as:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
s \cdot \begin{bmatrix} X_1 \\ X_2 \\ X_3 \\ X_4 \end{bmatrix} &amp; = &amp; \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; -2.61 &amp; -3.41 &amp; -2.61 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} X_1 \\ X_2 \\ X_3 \\ X_4 \end{bmatrix} &amp; + &amp; \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} U \\
Y &amp; =  &amp; \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} X_1 \\ X_2 \\ X_3 \\ X_4 \end{bmatrix} &amp; + &amp; \begin{bmatrix} 0 \end{bmatrix} U
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Octave Code ====

The following [[Octave_Programming_Tutorial|Octave]] code provides the same results and plots the amplitude response of the filter:
 &gt; order = 4;
 &gt; [z, p, g] = butter(order, 1, 's')
     z = []  (0x0)
     p = -0.38268 + 0.92388i
         -0.92388 + 0.38268i
         -0.92388 - 0.38268i
         -0.38268 - 0.92388i
     g =  1
 
 &gt; [b, a] = butter(order, 1, 's')
     b =  1
     a = 1.0000   2.6131   3.4142   2.6131   1.0000
 
 &gt; w = logspace(-1, 1, 100);
 &gt; while ( length(b) &lt; length(a) )
 &gt;   b = [0, b];
 &gt; endwhile;
 &gt; Adb = 20*log10(abs(freqs(b, a, w)));
 &gt; figure(1);
 &gt; semilogx(w, Adb);
 &gt; grid;
    ''An amplitude response plot appears in a Gnuplot window''
 
 &gt; [A, B, C, D] = tf2ss(b, a)
     A = 0.00000   1.00000   0.00000   0.00000
         0.00000   0.00000   1.00000   0.00000
         0.00000   0.00000   0.00000   1.00000
        -1.00000  -2.61313  -3.41421  -2.61313
 
     B = 0
         0
         0
         1
 
     C = 1   0   0   0
 
     D = 0
 
 &gt; eig(A)
     ans = -0.38268 + 0.92388i
           -0.38268 - 0.92388i
           -0.92388 + 0.38268i
           -0.92388 - 0.38268i
 
 &gt; poly(A)
     ans = 1.0000   2.6131   3.4142   2.6131   1.0000

&lt;/div&gt;

=== Analog Lowpass Filter Design ===

&lt;div style=&quot;background: #CCEEFF; border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]] This example goes through the steps of designing an analog lowpass filter from given specifications.

==== Specification ====

[[File:G712-Butterworth.svg|thumb|right|CCITT G712 input lowpass filter specification]]
A reduced version of CCITT G712 input filter specification, giving only the lowpass part, is shown in the plot on the side. 

The passband goes up to &lt;math&gt;3 kHz&lt;/math&gt; and allows a maximal ripple of &lt;math&gt;0.125 dB&lt;/math&gt;.
The stopband requires an attenuation of &lt;math&gt;14 dB&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;4 kHz&lt;/math&gt; and an attenuation of &lt;math&gt;32 dB&lt;/math&gt; above &lt;math&gt;4.6 kHz&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Filter order ====

A first step is to evaluate the order needed for usual [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Signals_and_Systems/Filter_Implementations filter functions].
As there is no specification on the phase, there is no need to check for a Bessel function.

The following [[Octave_Programming_Tutorial|Octave]] code:
 fs = 40E3;
 fPass = 3000;
 rPass = 0.125;
 fStop1 = 4000;
 rStop1 = 14;
 fStop2 = 4600;
 rStop2 = 32;
 
 order1 = buttord(fPass/(fs/2), fStop1/(fs/2), rPass, rStop1);
 order2 = buttord(fPass/(fs/2), fStop2/(fs/2), rPass, rStop2);
 buttOrder = max(order1, order2)
 
 order1 = cheb1ord(fPass/(fs/2), fStop1/(fs/2), rPass, rStop1);
 order2 = cheb1ord(fPass/(fs/2), fStop2/(fs/2), rPass, rStop2);
 cheb1Order = max(order1, order2)
 
 order1 = cheb2ord(fPass/(fs/2), fStop1/(fs/2), rPass, rStop1);
 order2 = cheb2ord(fPass/(fs/2), fStop2/(fs/2), rPass, rStop2);
 cheb2Order = max(order1, order2)
 
 order1 = ellipord(fPass/(fs/2), fStop1/(fs/2), rPass, rStop1);
 order2 = ellipord(fPass/(fs/2), fStop2/(fs/2), rPass, rStop2);
 ellipticOrder = max(order1, order2)
 
 disp('Required filter orders:');
 printf(&quot;  Butterworth      : %2i\n&quot;, buttOrder)
 printf(&quot;  Chebyshev type 1 : %2i\n&quot;, cheb1Order)
 printf(&quot;  Chebyshev type 2 : %2i\n&quot;, cheb2Order)
 printf(&quot;  Elliptic (Cauer) : %2i\n&quot;, ellipticOrder)

gives us the results:
 Required filter orders:
   Butterworth      : 13
   Chebyshev type 1 :  6
   Chebyshev type 2 :  6
   Elliptic (Cauer) :  4

The Butterworth filter needs roughly twice as much hardware as the Chebyshev type&amp;nbsp;1.
The Chebyshev type&amp;nbsp;2 and the elliptic filter have zeroes which the Chebyshev type&amp;nbsp;1 filter doesn't, as it is an all-pole function.
So they too will need more hardware than the Chebyshev type&amp;nbsp;1.

'''Chebyshev type&amp;nbsp;1 will be the candidate chosen for this filter.'''

==== Transfer function ====

Octave does the frequency transforms automatically.
The amplitude response is obtained with:
 pointNb = 100;
 wLog = logspace(2, 5, pointNb);
 AdbMin = 40;
 
 [order, wc] = cheb1ord(fPass/(fs/2), fStop2/(fs/2), rPass, rStop2);
 order = order + 1;
 wc = 1.03 * wc;
 [num, den] = cheby1(order, rPass, (fs/2)*wc, 's');
 while ( length(num) &lt; length(den) )
   num = [0, num];
 endwhile;
 Adb = 20*log10(abs(freqs(num, den, wLog)));
 Adb(Adb &lt; -AdbMin) = -AdbMin;
 
 figure(1);
 semilogx(wLog, Adb);
 grid;
 hold on;
 semilogx([wLog(1), fPass, fPass], -[rPass, rPass, AdbMin], 'r');
 semilogx([fStop1, fStop1, fStop2, fStop2, wLog(length(wLog))], ...
         -[0     , rStop1, rStop1, rStop2, rStop2            ], 'r');
 hold off;
 xlabel('frequency [Hz]');
 ylabel('amplitude [dB]');

This gives the following plot:
 [[File:G712-Chebyshev1.svg|G712-Chebyshev1.svg]]

As one might have noticed, the filter order has been pushed up to&amp;nbsp;7 and the cutoff frequency has been pushed a little higher in order to balance the distance to the specification borders on the passband and the stopband side.

==== Filter coefficients ====

Obviously, the filter coefficients depend on the chosen filter structure.

For a [[Signal_Processing/Analog_Filters#Chain_of_Second_Order_Sections|chain of second order sections]], the higher order transfer function has to be split into the product of second order transfer functions:
 [zeroes, poles, gain] = cheby1(order, rPass, (fs/2)*wc, 's');
 [SOS, G] = zp2sos(zeroes, poles, gain)

This gives:
 SOS = 1.0000e+00   0.0000e+00   0.0000e+00   1.0000e+00   2.0033e+03   3.0335e+06
       1.0000e+00   0.0000e+00   0.0000e+00   1.0000e+00   1.3863e+03   7.0724e+06
       1.0000e+00   0.0000e+00   0.0000e+00   1.0000e+00   4.9478e+02   1.0311e+07
       1.0000e+00   0.0000e+00   0.0000e+00   1.0000e+00   1.1118e+03  -0.0000e+00
 
 G =  2.4594e+23 - 1.3998e+07i

The &quot;1, 0, 0&quot; beginning of the SOS matrix lines shows that they are all-pole functions.

The last SOS matrix line with values 0 at the third and at the last positions shows that it corresponds to a first order section.
Indeed, the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order function is made out of 3 second order sections and one first order section.

The imaginary part of the gain is to be ignored: it is certainly an error of fixed point calculus.
The real part of the gain is equal to the product of the last (non-zero) elements of the SOS matrix lines.

From these coefficients, one can find the analog element values of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_variable_filter state variable filters] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallen_Key_filter#Example:_Low-pass_filter Sallen-Key circuits] which both are of all-pole kind.
The coefficients can also used almost as such in the [http://www.williamsonic.com/StateVariable/index.html canonical biquads], but with &lt;math&gt;b_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which simplifies the circuits.
&lt;/div&gt;

Pointers:-

Pointer is one of the key aspects of C++ language similar to that of C. Pointer offer a unique approach to handle data in C and C++. Pointer is a derived data type that refers to another data variable by storing the variable’s memory address rather than data. A pointer variable defines where to get the value of a specific data variable instead of defining actual data. Pointers provide an alternative approach to access other data objects.

Declaring and Initializing Pointers:-
We can declare a pointer variable similar to other variables in C++. Like C, the declaration is based on the data type of the variable it points to. The declaration of a pointer variable takes the following form:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Data-type *pointer-variable;
|}


 
Here, pointer-variable is the name of the pointer, and the data-type refers to one of the valid C++ data types, such as int, char, float, and so on. The data-type is followed by an asterisk (*) symbol, which distinguishes a pointer variable from other variables to the compiler.
A pointer variable can point to any type of data available in C++. A pointer is able to point to only one data type at the specific time. Let us declare and initialize a pointer variable as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Int *ptr, a; //declaration
ptr = &amp;a; //initialization
|}

 
Here, ptr is a pointer variable and points to an integer data type. The pointer variable, ptr, should contain the memory location of any integer variable. The pointer variable, ptr, contains the address of the variable a. The second statement assigns the address of the variable a to the pointer ptr. The following program explains how to refer to a pointer’s address by using a pointer in C++.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
#include &lt;conio.h&gt;
Void main()
{

Int a, *ptr1, **ptr2;
Clrscr();
ptr1 = &amp;a;
ptr2 = &amp;ptr1;
cout &lt;&lt; “The address of a: “ &lt;&lt; ptr1 &lt;&lt; ”\n” ;
cout &lt;&lt; “The address of ptr1: “ &lt;&lt; ptr2 ;
cout &lt;&lt; “\n\n” ;
cout &lt;&lt; “After incrementing the address values:\n\n”;
ptr1+=2;
cout &lt;&lt; “The address of a: “ &lt;&lt; ptr1 &lt;&lt; “\n”;
ptr2+=2;
cout &lt;&lt; “The address of ptr1: “ &lt;&lt; ptr2 &lt;&lt; “\n”;
}&lt;/source&gt;

 
The memory location is always addressed by the operating system. The output may vary depends on the system.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The address of a:        0x8facfff4
The address of ptr1:        0x8facfff2

After incrementing the address values:

The address of a:        0x8facfff8
The address of ptr1:        0x8facfff6&lt;/source&gt;


Manipulation of Pointers:-

We can manipulate a pointer with the indirection operator, i.e. ‘*’, which is also known as dereference operator. With this operator, we can indirectly access the data variable content. It takes the following general from:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| *pointer_variable
|}
 
As we know, dereferencing a pointer allows us to get the content of the memory location that the pointer points to. After assigning address of the variable to a pointer, we may want to change the content of the variable. Using the dereference operator, we can change the contents of the memory location.
For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
#include &lt;conio.h&gt;
Void main()
{
    int a=10, *ptr;
    ptr = &amp;a;
    clrscr();
    cout &lt;&lt; “The value of a is : “ &lt;&lt; a;
    cout &lt;&lt; “\n\n”;
    *ptr = (*ptr)/2;
    cout &lt;&lt; “The value of a is : “ &lt;&lt; (*ptr);
    cout &lt;&lt; “\n\n”;
    getch();
}&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Output is:&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The value of a is : 10

The value of a is : 5&lt;/source&gt;


Pointer Expressions and Pointer Arithmetic:-

There are a substantial number of arithmetic operations that can be performed with pointers. C++ allows pointers to perform the following arithmetic operations:
	A pointer can be incremented (++) or decremented (--)
	Any integer can be added to or subtracted from a pointer
	One pointer can be subtracted from another
Example:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Int a [6];
Int *aptr;
aptr = &amp;a [0];
|}

In the above pointer variable, aptr, refers to the base address of the variable a. We can increment the pointer variable, shown as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| aptr++ (or) ++aptr
|}

This statement moves the pointer to the next memory address. Similarly, we can decrement the pointer variable, as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| aptr-- (or) --aptr
|}

This statement moves the pointer to the previous memory address. Also, if two pointer variables point to the same array can be subtracted from each other.
For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;#include&lt;iostream.h&gt;
#include&lt;conio.h&gt;
Void main()
{
     int num[] = {56,75,22,18,90};
     int *ptr;
     int I;
     clrscr();
     cout &lt;&lt; “The array values are:\n”;
     for( i=0; i&lt;5; i++)
     cout &lt;&lt; num[i] &lt;&lt;”\n”;

/* Initializing the base address of str to ptr */

     ptr = num;

/* Printing the value in the array */
    cout &lt;&lt; “\n Value of ptr :        “&lt;&lt; *ptr;
     cout &lt;&lt; “\n”;
     ptr++;
     cout &lt;&lt; “\n Value of ptr++ :   “&lt;&lt; *ptr;
     cout &lt;&lt; “\n”;
     ptr--;
     cout &lt;&lt; “\n Value of ptr-- :    “&lt;&lt; *ptr;
     cout &lt;&lt; “\n”;
     ptr = ptr+2;
     cout &lt;&lt; “\n Value of ptr+2 :   “&lt;&lt; *ptr;
     cout &lt;&lt; “\n”;
     ptr = ptr-1;
     cout &lt;&lt; “\n Value of ptr-1 :    “&lt;&lt; *ptr;
     cout &lt;&lt; “\n”;
     ptr+=3;
     cout &lt;&lt; “\n Value of ptr+=3 :  “&lt;&lt; *ptr;
     ptr-=2;
     cout &lt;&lt; “\n”;
     cout &lt;&lt; “\n Value of ptr-=2 :   “&lt;&lt; *ptr;
     cout &lt;&lt; “\n”;
     getch();
} &lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Output is:&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The array values are:
56
75
22
18
90
Value of ptr :         56
Value of ptr++ :    75
Value of ptr-- :      56
Value of ptr+2 :    22
Value of ptr-1 :     75
Value of ptr+=3 :  90
Value of ptr-=2 :   22&lt;/source&gt;




Using Pointers with Arrays and Strings:-

Pointer is one of the efficient tools to access elements of an array. Pointers are useful to allocate arrays dynamically, i.e. we can decide the array size at run time. Accessing an array with pointers is simpler than accessing the array index.
In general, there are some differences between pointers and arrays, arrays refer to a block of memory space, whereas pointers do not refer to any section of memory. The memory addresses of arrays cannot be changed, whereas the content of the pointer variables, such as the memory addresses that it refer to, can be changed. We can declare the pointers to arrays as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| float *fptr;
fptr = price [0];
|}

Or

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| fptr = price;
|}

Here, fptr points to the first element of the array of float, price [0]. Let us consider an example of using pointers to access an array of numbers and sum up the even numbers of the array.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;#include&lt;iostream.h&gt;
void main()
{
          int numbers [50], *ptr;
          int n, i;
          cout&lt;&lt;”\nEnter The count\n”;
          cin&gt;&gt;n;
          cout&lt;&lt;”\nEnter the numbers one by one\n”;
          for(i=0;i&lt;n;i++)
          cin&gt;&gt;numbers [i];
/* Assigning the base address of numbers to ptr and initializing the sum to 0*/
          ptr = numbers;
          int sum=0;
/* Check out for even inputs and sum up them*/
          for(i=0;i&lt;n;i++)
          {
                 If(*ptr%2==0)
                 sum = sum + *ptr;
                 ptr++;
           }
           cout&lt;&lt;”\n\nSum of even numbers: “&lt;&lt;sum;
}&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Output is:&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Enter the count
5


Enter the numbers one by one
10
16
23
45
34


Sum of even numbers: 60&lt;/source&gt;


Arrays of Pointers:-

An array of pointers point to an array of data items. Each element of the pointer array points to an item of data array. Data items can be accessed either directly or by dereferencing the elements of pointer array. We can reorganize the pointer elements without affecting the data items.
We can declare an array of pointers as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Int *inarray [10];
|}

This statement declares an array of 10 pointers, each of which points to an integer. The address of the first pointer is inarray [0], and the second pointer is inarray [1], and the final pointer points to inarray [9]. Before initializing, they points to some unknown values in the memory space.
We can use the pointer variable to refer to some specific values. The following program explains the implementation of array of pointers.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;#include&lt;iostream.h&gt;
#include&lt;conio.h&gt;
#include&lt;string.h&gt;
#include&lt;ctype.h&gt;
void main()
{
              int i=0;
              char *ptr [10] =  {“books”,”television”,”computer”,”sports”};
              char  str [25];
              clrscr();
              cout&lt;&lt;”\n\n\n\nEnter your favorite leisure                                        pursuit: “;
              cin&gt;&gt;str;
              for(i=0; i&lt;4; i++)
              {
                      if(!strcmp(str, *ptr [i]))
                      {
                              cout&lt;&lt;”\n\nYour favorite pursuit  “&lt;&lt;”is available here”&lt;&lt;endl;
                              break;
                      }
              }
              if(i==4)
                  cout&lt;&lt;”\n\nYour favorite “&lt;&lt;”not available here”&lt;&lt;endl;
              getch();
}&lt;/source&gt;


 &lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Output of program:&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Enter your favorite leisure pursuit: books

Your favorite pursuit is available here&lt;/source&gt;


Pointers and Strings:-

Pointers are efficient to access two dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays in C++.There is definite relationship between arrays and pointers. C++ also allows us to handle the special kind of arrays, i.e. string with pointers.

We know that a string is one dimensional array of characters, which start with the index 0 and ends with the null character ‘\0’ in C++. A pointer variable can access a string by referring to its first character. As we know, there are two ways to assign a value to a string. We can use the character array or variable of type char *. Let us consider the following string declarations:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| char num [] = “one”;
const char *numptr = “one”;
|}

The first declaration creates an array of four characters, which contains the characters, ‘o’, ‘n’, ‘e’, ‘\0’, whereas the second declaration generates a pointer variable, which points to the first character, i.e. ‘o’ of the string.
There is numerous string handling functions available in C++. All of these functions are available in the header file &lt;string.h&gt;.
In example, shows how to reverse a string using pointers and arrays.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;#include&lt;iostream.h&gt;
#include&lt;string.h&gt;
Void main()
{
          char str [] = “Test”;
          int len = strlen(str);
          for(int i=0; i&lt;len; i++)
          {
                    cout&lt;&lt; str [i] &lt;&lt; i [str]
                    &lt;&lt; *(str+i)&lt;&lt;*(i+str);
          }
          cout&lt;&lt;endl;
//String reverse
         int lenM = len/2;
         len--;
         for(i=0; i&lt;lenM; i++)
         {
                  str [i] = str [i] + str [len-i];
                  str [len-i] = str [i] – str [len-i];
                  str [i] = str [i] – str [len-i];
         }
         cout&lt;&lt;”The string reversed : “ &lt;&lt;str;
}&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Output is:&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;TTTTeeeesssstttt
The string reversed : tesT&lt;/source&gt;


Pointers to Functions:-

The pointer to function is known as callback function. We can use these function pointers to refer to a function. Using function pointers, we can allow a C++ program to select a function dynamically at run time. We can also pass a function as an argument to another function. Here, the function is passed as a pointer. The function pointers cannot be dereferencing.
Like the other variables, we can declare a function pointer in C++. It takes the following form:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| data_type(*function_name());
|}

Example:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| int (*num_function(int x));
|}

Remember that declaring a pointer only creates a pointer. It does not create actual function. The function must have the same return type and arguments. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;#include&lt;iostream.h&gt;
typedef void (*FunPtr)(int, int);
void Add(int i, int j)
{
Cout&lt;&lt;i&lt;&lt;”+”&lt;&lt;j&lt;&lt;”=”&lt;&lt;i+j;
}
void Subtract(int i, int j)
{
cout&lt;&lt;i&lt;&lt;”-“&lt;&lt;j&lt;&lt;”=”&lt;&lt;i-j;
}
void main()
{
FunPtr ptr;
ptr = &amp;Add;
ptr(1,2);
cout&lt;&lt;endl;
ptr = &amp;Subtract;
ptr(3,2);
}&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Output is:&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;1 + 2 = 3

3 – 2 = 1&lt;/source&gt;</text>

=Introduction=

This page lists a series of How-tos using SPM. They should work with all recent versions of the software.

==How to manually change the orientation of an image?==
[[File:Spm reorient.png|thumbnail|SPM Display]]
To change the origin of an image:
* open the image with SPM Display
* move the crosshair position so that it roughly points to the [[w:Anterior_commissure|anterior commissure]] (AC).
* click on the Set Origin button
* click on the Reorient button and press done (your image is already selected). If you want to apply the same transformation to other images (e.g. if you have a series of functional images), select them all at this stage.
* say No to Do you want to save the reorientation matrix?
This will set the origin of the image (0 0 0 mm coordinates) to AC.
You might also want to rotate the image such that it is better aligned with MNI space: to do so, you also need to edit the entries for the rotations (in [[w:Radian|radian]]) along the [[w:Aircraft_principal_axes|pitch, roll and yaw axes]].

See also: [http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/FindingCommissures Finding Commissures].

For earlier versions of SPM, see [http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/meg/RepositioningMRIs Repositioning MRIs].

==How to compute the mean of a set of images?==
Use the '''ImCalc''' facility with ''expression'' &quot;mean(X)&quot; and ''Data Matrix'' option set to &quot;yes - read images into data matrix&quot;. You can also choose the output filename (say ''mean.img'') for the mean image and its directory (default is current folder).

[[File:SPM Imcalc mean image.png|SPM Imcalc mean image]]

Alternatively, you can use the '''spm_mean_ui''' function but  the number of options is limited - '''ImCalc''' should be preferred.

If you want to compute the sum instead, just use ''expression'' &quot;sum(X)&quot;.

==How to change file paths in a batch file or SPM.mat?==
If you change the location of your data and/or the SPM installation, the full paths contained in batch files and SPM.mat will be broken. An utility function '''spm_changepath''' is available in SPM to replace all occurrences of one string with another within a MAT-file. For example:
 spm_changepath('SPM.mat','C:\mydata','D:\Experiments\data');
will update the ''SPM.mat'' file to replace all occurrence of ''C:\mydata'' with ''D:\Experiments\data''. A backup of the initial file can be found in ''SPM.mat.old''. A list of all the altered paths will be displayed at runtime.

==How to choose the colour limits in a surface rendering?==

By default, the colour limits are such that they span min/max of the rendered data. If you want to specify them yourself, you can use the following piece of code:

 H = getappdata(get(findobj('Tag','SPMMeshRender'),'Parent'),'handles');
 spm_mesh_render('CLim',H) % return current limits
 spm_mesh_render('CLim',H,[0 16]); % set limits to [0 16]

==How to remove clusters under a certain size in a binary mask?==

The following piece of code will read a binary mask (''ROI''), perform connected component labelling, filter out all clusters under a certain size in voxel (variable ''k'') and save it as another mask (''ROIf'').

 ROI  = 'myvoi.nii';  % input image (binary, ie a mask)
 k    = 100;          % minimal cluster size
 ROIf = 'newvoi.nii'; % output image (filtered on cluster size)
 
 %-Connected Component labelling
 V = spm_vol(ROI);
 dat = spm_read_vols(V);
 [l2, num] = spm_bwlabel(double(dat&gt;0),26);
 if ~num, warning('No clusters found.'); end
 
 %-Extent threshold, and sort clusters according to their extent
 [n, ni] = sort(histc(l2(:),0:num), 1, 'descend');
 l  = zeros(size(l2));
 n  = n(2:end); ni = ni(2:end)-1;
 ni = ni(n&gt;=k); n  = n(n&gt;=k);
 for i=1:length(n), l(l2==ni(i)) = i; end
 clear l2 ni
 fprintf('Selected %d clusters (out of %d) in image.\n',length(n),num);
 
 %-Write new image
 V.fname = ROIf;
 spm_write_vol(V,l~=0); % save as binary image. Remove '~=0' so as to
                        % have cluster labels as their size. 
                        % or use (l~=0).*dat if input image was not binary

==How to display NIfTI images in SPM when double-cliking on them in MATLAB Current Folder browser?==
Save the following functions in your MATLAB path:

 function openimg(img)
 spm_image('Display',img);

 function opennii(nii)
 N=nifti(nii);
 if size(N.dat,4) == 1
    spm_image('Display',nii);
 else
    if ~isdeployed, addpath(fullfile(spm('Dir'),'spm_orthviews')); end
    spm_ov_browser('ui',spm_select('expand',nii));
 end

==How to overlay a mask image on another one with transparency?==
After using Display &gt; Add Overlay or CheckReg &gt; Overlay &gt; Add coloured image, type the following:
 global st
 col = st.vols{1}.blobs{1}.colour;
 st.vols{1}.blobs{1}.colour = struct('cmap',[0 0 0;col],'prop',0.5);

[[File:Fastfood.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Billboards along a highway. Note the orientation of the billboards for best visibility.]]
This tutorial introduces '''billboards'''. 

It is based on {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Textured Spheres}} and the discussion in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}.

=== Billboards ===
In computer graphics, billboards are textured rectangles that are transformed such that they always appear parallel to the view plane. Thus, they are similar to billboards along highways in that they are rotated for best visibility. However, they are different from highway billboards since they are dynamically rotated to always offer best visibility. 

The main use of billboards is to replace complex three-dimensional models (e.g. grass, bushes, or even trees) by two-dimensional images. In fact, Unity also uses billboards to render grass. Moreover, billboards are often used to render two-dimensional sprites. In both applications, it is crucial that the billboard is always aligned parallel to the view plane in order to keep up the illusion of a three-dimensional shape although only a two-dimensional image is rendered.

=== Vertex Transformation for Billboards ===

Similarly to {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Skyboxes}}, we are going to use the default cube object to render a billboard. The basic idea is to transform only the origin &lt;math&gt;(0,0,0,1)&lt;/math&gt; of the object space to view space with the standard transformation &lt;code&gt;gl_ModelViewMatrix&lt;/code&gt;. (In homogeneous coordinates all points have a 1 as fourth coordinate; see the discussion in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}.) View space is just a rotated version of world space with the &lt;math&gt;x y&lt;/math&gt; plane parallel to the view plane as discussed in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}. Thus, this is the correct space to construct an appropriately rotated billboard. We add the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; object coordinates (&lt;code&gt;gl_Vertex.x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gl_Vertex.y&lt;/code&gt;) to the transformed origin in view coordinates and then transform the result with the projection matrix &lt;code&gt;gl_ProjectionMatrix&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;code&gt;gl_Position = gl_ProjectionMatrix * (gl_ModelViewMatrix * vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) + vec4(gl_Vertex.x, gl_Vertex.y, 0.0, 0.0));&lt;/code&gt;

Apart from this, we only have to compute texture coordinates, which is done the same way as in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Screen Overlays}}:

&lt;code&gt;textureCoords = vec4(gl_Vertex.x + 0.5, gl_Vertex.y + 0.5, 0.0, 0.0);&lt;/code&gt;
 
Then the fragment shader just looks up the color at the interpolated texture coordinates.

=== Complete Shader Code ===
The complete shader code for the standard cube object is now:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
Shader &quot;GLSL shader for billboards&quot; {
   Properties {
      _MainTex (&quot;Texture Image&quot;, 2D) = &quot;white&quot; {}
   }
   SubShader {
      Pass {   
         GLSLPROGRAM

         // User-specified uniforms            
         uniform sampler2D _MainTex;        

         // Varyings
         varying vec4 textureCoords;
         
         #ifdef VERTEX
         
         void main()
         {
            gl_Position = gl_ProjectionMatrix 
               * (gl_ModelViewMatrix * vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) 
               + vec4(gl_Vertex.x, gl_Vertex.y, 0.0, 0.0));

            textureCoords = 
               vec4(gl_Vertex.x + 0.5, gl_Vertex.y + 0.5, 0.0, 0.0);
         }
         
         #endif

         #ifdef FRAGMENT
         
         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = texture2D(_MainTex, vec2(textureCoords));
         }
         
         #endif

         ENDGLSL
      }
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that we never apply the model matrix to the object coordinates because we don't want to rotate them. However, this means that we also cannot scale them. Nonetheless, if you specify scale factors for the cube in Unity, you will notice that the billboard is actually scaled. The reason is that Unity performs the scaling on the object coordinates before they are sent to the vertex shader (unless all three scale factors are positive and equal, then the scaling is specified by &lt;code&gt;1.0 / unity_Scale.w&lt;/code&gt;). Thus, in order to scale the billboard you can either use the scaling by Unity (with different scale factors for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;) or you can introduce additional shader properties for scaling the object coordinates in the vertex shader.

=== Summary ===
Congratulations, you made it to the end of this tutorial. We have seen:
* How to transform and texture a cube in order to render a view-aligned billboard.

=== Further Reading ===
If you still want to learn more 
*about object space, world space, view space, &lt;code&gt;gl_ModelViewMatrix&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gl_ProjectionMatrix&lt;/code&gt;, you should read the description in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}.
*about texturing, you should read {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Textured Spheres}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Use background-position:0 -## where ## is equal to the y-coordinate of the first pixel of the desired area to reposition sprites

Use the background-position property to change the hover state of links with background images using CSS sprites

Use background-image instead of the background shorthand when using ID selectors to avoid inadvertently overriding class-based background-position changes for CSS sprites

Use the clip property on image tags to do foreground spriting

Make sure class selectors aren't inadvertently overridden by default values of ID selectors, 
especially background-position changes for sprites, by dividing the properties of ID selectors using longhand notation

== Wikis in education ==
[[File: File:Exempel WIKI.jpg thumb Exempel WIKI |thumbnail|right]]
A '''wiki''' is an online tool used in education by teachers and students to collaborate and create new user generated content together in an easy to use website&lt;ref&gt;“Wiki - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia,” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki.&lt;/ref&gt;.  With a wiki, users only need an internet connection and a computer to collaborate Wikis can be used for many purposes, including organizing a group's input&lt;ref&gt;Lee LeFever, “Wikis in Plain English - Common Craft,” http://www.commoncraft.com/video-wikis-plain-english.&lt;/ref&gt;.  This can be a powerful tool when used in the classroom.  Wikis are used in schools to extend the classroom and the learning space.  Students can update and change a document not only with students in the same class but across the same grade level or the entire school.  Students can even use wikis to collaborate with students in another country.   Educators can use wikis to collaborate with one another about curriculum across the entire school districts or with educators worldwide. &lt;ref&gt;Solomon, G. S. (2007). Web 2.0, new tools, new schools. Washington, DC: International Society for Technology in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

== What is a wiki? ==
[[File:Wikinews collaboration logo.svg|thumb|Wiki Collaboration]]
A wiki is a simple and fast website that enables people to collaborate to create a website together, with no need to learn any complicated code.  Wikis can be used for a variety of purposes, but can be especially helpful when used for education.  Wikis are easy to edit and rely on the knowledge of regular people to edit them. Entries and editing should be completed from a neutral point of view. &lt;br /&gt;

[[File:Http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Ward Cunningham - Commons-1.jpg|thumbnail|Ward Cunningham]]
== History ==
The first wiki ever created was called WikiWikiWeb.  It was created by Ward Cunningham.  He got the name from the Hawaiian &quot;wiki&quot; meaning quick &lt;ref&gt;David H. Jonassen, Jane L. Howland, and Rose M. Marra, Meaningful Learning with Technology (2-downloads), 4th ed. (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;.   By far Wikipedia is the most famous wiki with the greatest sum of human knowledge.
Some people think it is the most important website on the Internet.  &lt;ref&gt;Richardson, W. (2010). Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts and Other Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms. Thousand Oaks: Corwin.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, IP addresses owned by The Church of Scientology were banned from Wikipedia for making edits from a non-neutral point of view &lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, D. (2009, August 18). A brief history of wikipedia. Time Business and Money. Retrieved on June 8, 2013, from  http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1917002,00.html.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== What you need to get started ==
[[File:Walden computer.JPG|thumb|All you need to get your Wiki started]]
You’ll need a computer and internet connection.  If you have these all you need is a wiki platform or web application.  You’ll need to visit one of these sites, create an account with them, and you’ll be editing your very own wiki in no time.

=== Popular educational wiki sites ===
Some of the best examples of wiki applications that can be used for the classroom are wikispaces and pbwikis.  Both can be used to create classroom wikis that are either teacher or student lead.

http://www.wikispaces.com&lt;ref&gt;“Wikis for Everyone - Wikispaces,” http://www.wikispaces.com/.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
http://pbworks.com&lt;ref&gt;“PBworks: Online Collaboration,” http://pbworks.com/.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Why use wikis for education? ===
Wikis are ideal for education because they are free, easy to use, and enable students and teachers to generate their own content.  With most wiki internet applications teachers can monitor who is posting what content.  You can organize an entire course on a wiki.&lt;ref&gt;Using Wikis in the Classroom, 2009, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pR5yogCmkA&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player.&lt;/ref&gt;
Students need to learn to work with one another in school to be successful in college and the workplace.  Wikis need to be used to promote collaboration in the classroom.  Wikis can be used to complete team projects.  As students work in their teams they can revise and update the information as needed. Writing is one of the most important skills that we learn in school.  Wikis can be used to complete collaborative writing projects in any subject not just English.  &lt;ref&gt;Solomon, G. S. (2007). Web 2.0, new tools, new schools. Washington, DC: International Society for Technology in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to enabling collaborative content creation, wikis can also be used for peer assessment, formative evaluation of student work, individual, as well as group reflection, on learning experiences, and up-to-date information regarding changes in collaborative spaces, and can be used in the development of authentic learning tasks.&lt;ref&gt; Duffy, Peter and Bruns, Axel (2006) The Use of Blogs, Wikis and RSS in Education: A Conversation of Possibilities. In Proceedings Online Learning and Teaching Conference 2006, pages pp. 31-38, Brisbane.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">SKamara- Wilkes 2013 Summer 1 Team, Fine job contributing to information about Wikis. I learned new things and have things to consider about using wikis with students. 

SShoop- @CC Great job with reasons to use wikis in education.  I will admit that they have never been my favorite tool to use. I have had many students delete other people's things on a wiki. Although you can restore it, we had problems with people not saving and then we couldn't restore. Wikispaces I find is much more user friendly than this website.  
[[User:1sshoop|1sshoop]] ([[User talk:1sshoop|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/1sshoop|contribs]]) 03:42, 11 June 2013 (UTC)

CC - I added to &quot;Why use wikis for education&quot; and &quot;Advantages of using wikis in the classroom.&quot;  I also added a reference.  I tried to add a picture of Ward Cunningham in the history section, but right now, it is only showing up as a link.  I guess it needs to be approved?

RG- Added Wikibook library icon, as well as edited what is a wiki and history sections.

MN - Created the wiki, TOC, headings, and references section.  Created the wikis in education section, history, what you need to get started including popular educational wiki sites and why use wikis in the classroom.&lt;br /&gt;

CH - Created the advantages and disadvantages of using wikis in the classroom, inserted relevant pictures,and references.

HB - I enjoyed your project. It was informative in an understandable way. Advantages and Disadvantages sections were a good addition.

SM - I appreciate that you highlighted the collaboration aspect of a Wiki via an image.  I think that is a critical benefit of Wikis, as a result I think highlighting the importance was a great idea.

Alana - good project.  The list of advantages was great.  That along with this week's assignment has really made me think about using wikis more in the classroom.

Matthew S- RB I like the section that you added to the Wikibook &quot;Why use wikis in Education&quot;.  You made a very good contribution to the Wikibook and the points you made about why Wikibooks are used in education were very good.  I liked how you mentioned about Wikibooks being used in any subject area not just English because Wikibooks are used mainly to enhance writing skills.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The information regarding page faults is incomplete. The majority of page faults occur when the MMU/TLB detects an invalid page access. This can either be a read/write exception, a user/supervisory exception or a &quot;page not present&quot; exception. If the last is true and the page is mapped onto the page file (disk space) then it will be loaded into random access memory. Else, there is an invalid page fault and the operating system will typically kill the user-mode process.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Example 1.2 is wrong ==

According to my calculations, taking:

:&lt;math&gt;
T=
\begin{pmatrix}
\sqrt{3}/2  &amp;-1/2  \\
1/2         &amp;\sqrt{3}/2
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

will yield

&lt;math&gt;
T^2 - 2T=
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1-2\sqrt{3}}{2}  &amp;\frac{2-\sqrt{3}}{2}  \\
\frac{2-\sqrt{3}}{2}         &amp;\frac{1-2\sqrt{3}}{2}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

From which:

&lt;math&gt;
T^2 - 2T - I=
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{-1-2\sqrt{3}}{2}  &amp;\frac{2-\sqrt{3}}{2}  \\
\frac{2-\sqrt{3}}{2}         &amp;\frac{-1-2\sqrt{3}}{2}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[User:Wisapi|Wisapi]] ([[User talk:Wisapi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wisapi|contribs]]) 21:19, 3 August 2011 (UTC)

Well I get a different wrong answer from

&lt;math&gt;
T^2 - 2T=
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1-2\sqrt{3}}{2}  &amp;\frac{2-\sqrt{3}}{2}  \\
\frac{\sqrt{3}-2}{2}         &amp;\frac{1-2\sqrt{3}}{2}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

From which:

&lt;math&gt;
T^2 - 2T - I=
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{-1-2\sqrt{3}}{2}  &amp;\frac{2-\sqrt{3}}{2}  \\
\frac{\sqrt{3}-2}{2}         &amp;\frac{-1-2\sqrt{3}}{2}
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Drawing vectors on the back of an envelope suggests maybe 

&lt;math&gt;
-T^4 + T^2 - I = 0 
&lt;/math&gt;

[[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 22:40, 3 August 2011 (UTC)

or 

&lt;math&gt;
T^2 -\sqrt{3}T - I = 0 
&lt;/math&gt;

:Yup! my first calculation was wrong. Yours seems to be right (actually I'd say that yours ''is'' right). I'll use the method explained in example 1.6 to see what polynomial I get. This will take some minutes.
:But how did you use vectors to make this calculation on matrices? [[User:Wisapi|Wisapi]] ([[User talk:Wisapi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wisapi|contribs]]) 23:21, 3 August 2011 (UTC)

::Well, we know T produces a rotation, so T squared is just the same rotation repeated. If you draw just one of the basis vectors (1,0) or (0,1) as modified by the rotations, and sum the vectors graphically then the geometry is fairly clear. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 23:30, 3 August 2011 (UTC)

:::I did the calculations from the Ansatz in example 1.6 and I arrived at
:::&lt;math&gt;
T^2 -\sqrt{3}T + I = 0 
&lt;/math&gt;
:::I also checked it graphically, as you explained, and I got the same result. &lt;math&gt; -T^4 + T^2 - I = 0 &lt;/math&gt; is also possible (I tested it graphically), but as this is not a minimal polynomial (the leading coefficient isn't even 1) we should keep the other equation. I'll modify the article. By the way would you mind taking a look at these other comments of mine in this wikibook?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Under Voicing there is a section titled Notes.  There are some minor grammatical errors here.  I found them to be distracting while I was studying.  Sorry.

Minor grammar corrections:
Under Note 1: the word &quot;there're&quot; should be &quot;there are&quot;.  I have never ever seen &quot;there are&quot; written as a contraction.
Under Note 2 and 3, in the first line of each, the word &quot;doesn't&quot; should be &quot;don't&quot;.  In both cases, the verb needs to agree with a plural subject. She/He/it doesn't but they don't.

The information regarding when k changes to g and ğ certainly clears up many questions that I had regarding renk and rengi.  It also has given me the information that I need to apply this rule to other words where k follows a consonant.  Thank you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Chloroplasts ==
[[File:Chloroplast II.svg|400px|right]]

Chloroplasts are organelles that contain '''chlorophyll''', the green pigments that make plants green. They are often called '''plastids''', though plastids and chloroplasts are not exactly the same thing—a chloroplast is a special kind of plastid that photosynthesizes. Chloroplasts do lots of things, but their main function is '''photosynthesis'''.

Plant cells, and some protists have chloroplasts, though animal and fungal cells lack them. Prokaryotes do not have chloroplasts (or any other organelles), though some can carry out photosynthesis, its cell acting like one big chloroplast. In most cases, chloroplasts are green. 

Chloroplasts are cellular generators. They take in carbon dioxide and water, and release sugar and oxygen. This process is called '''photosynthesis'''. Mitochondria then use the sugar and oxygen to carry out cellular respiration, producing energy.

Mitochondria are essential parts of many eukaryotes, but they are useless without oxygen. Therefore, chloroplasts are extremely important. They produce breathable air for life.

Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own DNA. Scientists also think chloroplasts are descended from a kind of bacteria, called '''cyanobacteria'''. Cyanobacteria are the photosynthetic bacteria we mentioned earlier. In early stages of Earth, cyanobacteria produced oxygen for their friends, the ærobic bacteria ('''ærobic''' means they use oxygen). Some of these ærobic bacteria later migrated into a eukaryotic cell, becoming mitochondria. The cyanobacteria followed, becoming chloroplasts. All eukaryotic cells contain mitochondria, but only plants and algæ contain chloroplasts, so scientists think mitochondria came first. 

[[File:Plagiomnium_affine_laminazellen.jpeg|thumb|400px|left| Chloroplasts visible in the cells of Plagiomnium affine — Many-fruited Thyme-moss. Small green dots are chloroplasts, hexagons are plant cells. Chlorophylls contained in chloroplasts are so small to be distinguished in this picture.]]

==Welcome==
The Los Angeles metropolitan area hosts a number of rail transportation systems, the most notable of which are Metro Rail (operated by LACMTA, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority), Metrolink (a commuter rail system serving the greater Los Angeles area), and Amtrak Pacific Surfliner (an Amtrak line serving San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Luis Obispo).

This book is designed to instruct readers on how to get around Los Angeles by rail.

*Metro Rail currently has an acceptable amount of information for now (expansions are always welcome).  At the moment, it might be preferable to start the Metrolink pages.
*However, Metro Rail still lacks information about the fares in &quot;/The Savvy Traveler/Fares and Passes&quot; and an article about the tourist attractions in LA County at &quot;/Major LA Tourist Attractions/Metro Rail Tourist Attractions.&quot;
*Finally, route maps need to be implemented across the book on most pages that discuss lines (e.g. [[Getting around Los Angeles by Rail/Metro Rail/Metro Green Line|Green Line]] and 91 Line (future).

Thanks for all your help!

[[File:Deformation de la ligne de labdomen et des reins par le corset.png|250px|thumb|left|Illustration of deformations by corsets. These are examples of nonlinear deformations that cannot be modeled by a linear transformation.]]
This tutorial introduces '''vertex blending''' as an example of a nonlinear deformation. The main application is actually the rendering of skinned meshes.

While this tutorial is not based on any other specific tutorial, a good understanding of {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}} is very useful.

===Blending between Two Model Transformations===
Most deformations of meshes cannot be modeled by the affine transformations with 4×4 matrices that are discussed in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}. The deformation of bodies by tight corsets is just one example. A more important example in computer graphics is the deformation of meshes when joints are bent, e.g. elbows or knees. 

This tutorial introduces vertex blending to implement some of these deformations. The basic idea is to apply multiple model transformations in the vertex shader (in this tutorial we use only two model transformations) and then blend the transformed vertices, i.e. compute a weighted average of them with weights that have to be specified for each vertex. For example, the deformation of the skin near a joint of a skeleton is mainly influenced by the position and orientation of the two (rigid) bones meeting in the joint. Thus, the positions and orientations of the two bones define two affine transformations. Different points on the skin are influenced differently by the two bones: points at the joint might be influenced equally by the two bones while points farther from the joint around one bone are more strongly influenced by that bone than the other. These different strengths of the influence of the two bones can be implemented by using different weights in the weighted average of the two transformations.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we use two uniform transformations &lt;code&gt;mat4 _Trafo0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mat4 _Trafo1&lt;/code&gt;, which are specified by the user. To this end a small JavaScript (which should be attached to the mesh that should be deformed) allows us to specify two other game objects and copies their model transformations to the uniforms of the shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode()

public var bone0 : GameObject;
public var bone1 : GameObject;

function Update () 
{
   if (null != bone0)
   {
      renderer.sharedMaterial.SetMatrix(&quot;_Trafo0&quot;, 
         bone0.renderer.localToWorldMatrix);
   }
   if (null != bone1)
   {
      renderer.sharedMaterial.SetMatrix(&quot;_Trafo1&quot;, 
         bone1.renderer.localToWorldMatrix);
   }
   if (null != bone0 &amp;&amp; null != bone1)
   {
      transform.position = 0.5 * (bone0.transform.position 
         + bone1.transform.position);
      transform.rotation = bone0.transform.rotation;
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
The two other game objects could be anything — I like cubes with one of the built-in semitransparent shaders such that their position and orientation is visible but they don't occlude the deformed mesh.

In this tutorial, the weight for the blending with the transformation &lt;code&gt;_Trafo0&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;gl_Vertex.z + 0.5&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;code&gt;float weight0 = gl_Vertex.z + 0.5;&lt;/code&gt;

and the other weight is &lt;code&gt;1.0 - weight0&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, the part with positive &lt;code&gt;gl_Vertex.z&lt;/code&gt; coordinates is influenced more by &lt;code&gt;_Trafo0&lt;/code&gt; and the other part is influenced more by &lt;code&gt;_Trafo1&lt;/code&gt;. In general, the weights are application dependent and the user should be allowed to specify weights for each vertex. 

The application of the two transformations and the weighted average can be written this way:

&lt;code&gt;vec4 blendedVertex = weight0 * (_Trafo0 * gl_Vertex) + (1.0 - weight0) * (_Trafo1 * gl_Vertex);&lt;/code&gt;

Then the blended vertex has to be multiplied with the view matrix and the projection matrix. The view transformation is not available directly but it can be computed by multiplying the model-view matrix (which is the product of the view matrix and the model matrix) with the inverse model matrix (which is available as &lt;code&gt;_World2Object&lt;/code&gt; times &lt;code&gt;unity_Scale.w&lt;/code&gt; except for the bottom-right element, which is 1):
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
      mat4 modelMatrixInverse = _World2Object * unity_Scale.w;
      modelMatrixInverse[3][3] = 1.0; 
      mat4 viewMatrix = gl_ModelViewMatrix * modelMatrixInverse;

      gl_Position = gl_ProjectionMatrix * viewMatrix * blendedVertex;
&lt;/source&gt;
In order to illustrate the different weights, we visualize &lt;code&gt;weight0&lt;/code&gt; by the red component and &lt;code&gt;1.0 - weight0&lt;/code&gt; by the green component of a color (which is set in the fragment shader):

&lt;code&gt;color = vec4(weight0, 1.0 - weight0, 0.0, 1.0);&lt;/code&gt;
 
For an actual application, we could also transform the normal vector by the two corresponding transposed inverse model transformations and perform per-pixel lighting in the fragment shader.

===Complete Shader Code===
All in all, the shader code looks like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
Shader &quot;GLSL shader for vertex blending&quot; {
   SubShader {
      Pass {   
         GLSLPROGRAM

         // Uniforms set by a script
         uniform mat4 _Trafo0; // model transformation of bone0
         uniform mat4 _Trafo1; // model transformation of bone1

         // The following built-in uniforms 
         // are also defined in &quot;UnityCG.glslinc&quot;, 
         // i.e. one could #include &quot;UnityCG.glslinc&quot; 
         uniform mat4 _Object2World; // model matrix
         uniform vec4 unity_Scale; // w = 1/scale
         uniform mat4 _World2Object; // inverse model matrix
            // all but the bottom-right element should be 
            // multiplied with unity_Scale.w
         
         // Varyings
         varying vec4 color;

         #ifdef VERTEX
                  
         void main()
         {
            float weight0 = gl_Vertex.z + 0.5; // depends on the mesh

            vec4 blendedVertex = weight0 * (_Trafo0 * gl_Vertex) 
               + (1.0 - weight0) * (_Trafo1 * gl_Vertex);

            mat4 modelMatrixInverse = _World2Object * unity_Scale.w;
            modelMatrixInverse[3][3] = 1.0; 
            mat4 viewMatrix = gl_ModelViewMatrix * modelMatrixInverse;
            
            gl_Position = 
               gl_ProjectionMatrix * viewMatrix * blendedVertex;

            color = vec4(weight0, 1.0 - weight0, 0.0, 1.0); 
               // visualize weight0 as red and weight1 as green
         }
         
         #endif


         #ifdef FRAGMENT
         
         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = color;
         }
         
         #endif

         ENDGLSL
      }
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This is, of course, only an illustration of the concept but it can already be used for some interesting nonlinear deformations such as twists around the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis. 

For skinned meshes in skeletal animation, many more bones (i.e. model transformations) are necessary and each vertex has to specify which bone (using, for example, an index) contributes with which weight to the weighted average. However, Unity computes the blending of vertices in software; thus, this topic is less relevant for Unity programmers.

===Summary===
Congratulations, you have reached the end of another tutorial. We have seen:
* How to blend vertices that are transformed by two model matrices.
* How this technique can be used for nonlinear transformations and skinned meshes.

=== Further Reading ===
If you still want to learn more 
*about the model transformation, the view transformation, and the projection, you should read the description in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}.
*about vertex skinning, you could read the section about vertex skinning in Chapter 8 of the “OpenGL ES 2.0 Programming Guide” by Aaftab Munshi, Dan Ginsburg, and Dave Shreiner, published 2009 by Addison-Wesley.

===Bedford Castle===
[[Image:Castle Hill, Bedford - geograph.org.uk - 646086.jpg|225px|thumb|right|Remaining motte of Bedford Castle]]
Bedford Castle was a medieval castle built after 1100 by Henry I. The castle played a prominent part in civil war of the Anarchy in the mid-12th century and in the First Barons' War at the start of the 13th century. The castle was significantly extended in stone, although the final plan of the castle remains uncertain. Henry III besieged the castle in 1224 the siege lasting eight weeks and involving an army of as many as 2,700 men. After the surrender of the castle, the king ordered its destruction. Although partially refortified in the 17th century during the English Civil War, the castle remained a ruin until the urban expansion in Bedford during the 19th century, when houses were built across much of the property. Today only part of the motte still stands, forming part of an archaeological park built on the site between 2007 and 2009.

===Someries Castle===
[[File:Someries Castle.jpg|225px|thumb|left|Someries Castle]]
Someries Castle (sometimes spelt Summeries Castle) is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, in the Parish of Hyde, near the town of Luton, Bedfordshire. It was built in the 15th century by Sir John Wenlock. Although always referred to as a castle it was actually a fortified manor house.  

The name of &quot;Someries Castle&quot; was derived from William de Someries, who had a residence on this site, but the title &quot;castle&quot; is contentious since it hardly describes the structure to which it is applied.  The site was acquired by Wenlock in 1430 and building the mansion commenced.  The house is unique in that it is regarded as one of the first brick buildings in England. The house was never completed by Wenlock, and was partly demolished in the 18th century. The brickwork can still be seen in the remains of the gatehouse, incorporating the chapel and lodge, which still stands today.

The remains of the original manor house and/or the earlier Norman Castle are now visible only as earthworks that outline the plot where the house originally stood, although remains of the gatehouse to the actual manor house and the chapel that was connected to it, are still partially standing. Some bricks from the manor house were used to build the nearby farm houses in the 17th century.

===Totternhoe Castle===
[[File:Totternhoe Castle - geograph.org.uk - 323991.jpg|225px|thumb|right|Totternhose Castle]]
Totternhoe Castle is a medieval castle in Bedfordshire. It overlooks the village of Totternhoe and was built during the Norman period, probably during the years of the Anarchy. It is a motte-and-bailey design, with two baileys rather than the more usual one. A wide ditch protects three sides of the castle, with the fourth protected by the edge of the chalk hill on which the castle is situated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">--Need for improvements--

This is not a very well written article as of the time of my writing today, August 4, 2011. I hate to say that, while not taking the time to suggest improvements, but it's true. I'm a student of the philosophy of science, and virtually every sentence here fails to reflect common understandings in the field. Key problems waiting to be addressed include: (1) the inaccurate definition of paradigm, which, in particular, does not reflect the (several) conceptions of paradigm explicated by Kuhn in the postscript to the second edition of his famous book; (2) the inaccurate presentation of paradigm shift, either as Kuhn originally presented it or as Kuhn and others subsequently modified it; and (3) the wholly inadequate linkage of such concepts to the philosophy of anthropology in general and cultural anthropology in particular.[[Special:Contributions/134.173.195.201|134.173.195.201]] ([[User talk:134.173.195.201|discuss]]) 20:16, 4 August 2011 (UTC)</text>

[[File:Twizel Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1202957.jpg|thumb|Twizell Castle]]
'''Twizell Castle''' stands on a bend of the River Till at Tillmouth Park, Northumberland. Below it, the medieval Twizell bridge spans the river. The gardens of the castle contain the earthwork remains of the once lost medieval village of Twizell, whilst the massive ruin presents the remains of an 18th century castle which was never completed.

A medieval tower house which once stood on the site was, in 1415, held by Sir John Heron. This was destroyed by the Scots in 1496, and the estate was sold by the Herons circa 1520 to a member of the Selby family. A survey in 1561 reported only the remnants of a tower house and a barmkin. Of the medieval structure, blocked windows, a chamfered doorway and the original north-east angle quoins are all that remains visible now.

In 1685 Sir Francis Blake purchased the estate from the widow Selby for £1,944, plus an annuity of £100, and the Blake family lived on the estate until 1738 when they moved to nearby Tillmouth Hall. From about 1770, he worked on the recreation of the castle as a Gothic Revival mansion, designed by architect James Nesbit of Kelso to be five levels tall. Despite some forty years of work, the project was never completed. When in 1882, the Blake's built a new mansion at Tillmouth Park much of the incomplete Twizell Castle was demolished and the stone used in the new construction. The house is now a two-story folly. Rectangular in plan, with circular towers on the angles and two wings on the north side, the basement rooms in the main block are stone and brick-vaulted as a precaution against fire.

===Boarstall Tower===
[[Image:Boarstall_Tower.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Boarstall Tower]]
Boarstall Tower is a 14th-century moated gatehouse located in Boarstall, Buckinghamshire and now, with its surrounding gardens, a National Trust property.

The gatehouse was built by John de Haudlo in 1312 and is all that remains of Boarstall House, a fortified manor house that was demolished in 1778. Although it was updated in 1615 for use as a banqueting pavilion or hunting lodge, it retained its mediaeval belfry, cross loops and crenellations. The exterior and many rooms are essentially unchanged. The property is tenanted with limited opening arrangements. Exterior rooms remain virtually unchanged since 1615.

Los Angeles County's Metro Rail serves five lines, two light rail and two heavy rail, which cover a total of 70 stations in 79 miles (127 km) of track. The system offers connections to Metro Bus lines (which take take passengers to destinations not served in trains), Metrolink trains (the commuter train for the greater Los Angeles area, from as far south as Oceanside to as far north as Oxnard), and Amtrak trains (only at Los Angeles Union Station).

==Lines==
Metro Rail currently operates five lines. The Red and Purple lines are heavy-rail transit systems, and the Gold, Green, and Blue lines (the Black/Expo line in the future) are light-rail transit systems.

[[File:Metrorail-red4.jpg|thumb|alt=A Red/Purple Line train.|Ansaldobreda HRT trains like this serve both the Red and Purple lines.]]

The Metro Red Line travels from Los Angeles Union Station (connection to the Gold Line) to North Hollywood (connection to the Metro Orange Line, which is a bus). It runs on a concurrency with the Metro Purple Line from the Los Angeles Union Station terminus to Wilshire/Vermont.

The Metro Purple Line serves as a reliever of transit services on the heavily-used Red Line. It starts at Los Angeles Union Station (transfer available to the Gold Line) and runs along the same track as the Red Line until Wilshire/Vermont. It then continues on Wilshire until it reaches Wilshire/Normandy and Wilshire/Western, its western terminus.

Both the Red and Purple lines use Ansaldo-Breda heavy-rail transit trains. The length of the train varies from time to time; longer trains are used on weekday rush hours and holidays, while shorter trains are used at other times.

The oldest of the Metro Rail lines, this line connects the southern-central part of Los Angeles county. Starting in Downtown Los Angeles (7th Street/Metro Center station), it proceeds directly south, passing the Staples Center and many suburban communities until reaching its termini stations at Long Beach. The terminus is a loop, so trains serving the entire line will start at 7th Street/Metro Center, continue south until reaching the loop, traveling around the loop, then returning north back to 7th Street. A half-mile from 7th Street/Metro Center to Pico is underground; the track surfaces once it leaves the dense downtown area, before it reaches Pico.

Before the extension of the Gold Line in 2009, this was the longest line in the Metro Rail system with 21 stations. The initial segment was the first railway LACMTA (Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority) opened. The Loop soon followed, then the extension into the Financial District (from Pico to 7th Street/Metro Center). This line still uses its original Nippon-Sharyo fleet but is updating to newer Siemens trains soon.

This line runs almost entirely along I-105 (Century Freeway) and is most notable for passing LAX. Starting at Norwalk (also known as I-605/I-105), several miles short of the Metrolink Norwalk/Santa Fe Springs Station, it continues in an easterly direction along I-105, reaching the transfer station to the Blue Line, Imperial/Wilmington. It then continues along the Century Freeway before passing LAX at Aviation/LAX Station (which provides a free shuttle to LAX). It then leaves the 105 Freeway just before its end and turns south to pass El Segundo and finally terminate at Redondo Beach.

This line was built after the Red and Blue Lines but before the designation of the Purple Line. It uses Siemens trains.

The most recently completed line, the Gold Line serves the suburbs of Pasadena, Los Angeles Union Station, and East LA. This train starts at its northerly terminus at Sierra Madre Villa. From there it runs along the I-210 until it makes a turn and goes through Pasadena. It then passes through Chinatown and Los Angeles Union Station, a transfer stop to the Red and Purple Lines, and continues in a southeast direction until it reaches Atlantic station in East Los Angeles. This line utilizes the newest fleet of Ansaldo-Breda LRT trains and is the longest line, surpassing the Blue Line with its southeast extension in 2009.

[[File:Smiley green alien huh.svg|100px|thumb|left|A cartoon character with a drop shadow.]]
This tutorial covers the '''projection of shadows onto planes'''. 

It is not based on any particular tutorial; however, some understanding of {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}} is useful.

===Projecting Hard Shadows onto Planes===
Computing realistic shadows in real time is difficult. However, there are certain cases that are a lot easier. Projecting a hard shadow (i.e. a shadow without penumbra; see {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Soft Shadows of Spheres}}) onto a plane is one of these cases. The idea is to render the shadow by rendering the shadow-casting object in the color of the shadow with the vertices projected just above the shadow-receiving plane. 

{{clear}}
[[File:Projected Shadow.png|250px|thumb|left|Illustration of the projection of a point '''P''' in direction '''L''' onto a plane in the coordinate system of the plane.]]
===Projecting an Object onto a Plane===
In order to render the projected shadow, we have to project the object onto a plane. In order to specify the plane, we will use the local coordinate system of the default plane game object. Thus, we can easily modify the position and orientation of the plane by editing the plane object. In the coordinate system of that game object, the actual plane is just the &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt; plane, which is spanned by the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axes. 

Projecting an object in a vertex shader means to project each vertex. This could be done with a projection matrix similar to the one discussed in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}. However, those matrices are somewhat difficult to compute and debug. Therefore, we will take another approach and compute the projection with a bit of vector arithmetics. The illustration to the left shows the projection of a point '''P''' in the direction of light '''L''' onto a shadow-receiving plane. (Note that the vector '''L''' is in the opposite direction than the light vectors that are usually employed in lighting computations.) In order to move the point '''P''' to the plane, we add a scaled version of '''L'''. The scaling factor turns out to be the distance of '''P''' to the plane divided by the length of '''L''' in the direction of the normal vector of the plane (because of similar triangles as indicated by the gray lines). In the coordinate system of the plane, where the normal vector is just the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis, we can also use the ratio of the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; coordinate of the point '''P''' divided by the negated &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; coordinate of the vector '''L'''. 

Thus, the vertex shader could look like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         GLSLPROGRAM

         // User-specified uniforms
         uniform mat4 _World2Receiver; // transformation from 
            // world coordinates to the coordinate system of the plane

         // The following built-in uniforms  
         // are also defined in &quot;UnityCG.glslinc&quot;, 
         // i.e. one could #include &quot;UnityCG.glslinc&quot; 
         uniform mat4 _Object2World; // model matrix
         uniform mat4 _World2Object; // inverse model matrix
         uniform vec4 unity_Scale; // w = 1/uniform scale; 
            // should be multiplied to _World2Object 
         uniform vec4 _WorldSpaceLightPos0; 
            // position or direction of light source
                  
         #ifdef VERTEX
         
         void main()
         {            
            mat4 modelMatrix = _Object2World;
            mat4 modelMatrixInverse = _World2Object * unity_Scale.w;
            modelMatrixInverse[3][3] = 1.0; 
            mat4 viewMatrix = gl_ModelViewMatrix * modelMatrixInverse;

            vec4 lightDirection;
            if (0.0 != _WorldSpaceLightPos0.w) // point or spot light?
            {
               lightDirection = normalize(
                  modelMatrix * gl_Vertex - _WorldSpaceLightPos0);
            } 
            else // directional light
            {
               lightDirection = -normalize(_WorldSpaceLightPos0); 
            }
            
            vec4 vertexInWorldSpace = modelMatrix * gl_Vertex;
            float distanceOfVertex = 
               (_World2Receiver * vertexInWorldSpace).y; 
               // = height over plane 
            float lengthOfLightDirectionInY = 
               (_World2Receiver * lightDirection).y; 
               // = length in y direction

            lightDirection = lightDirection 
               * (distanceOfVertex / (-lengthOfLightDirectionInY));

            gl_Position = gl_ProjectionMatrix * (viewMatrix 
               * (vertexInWorldSpace + lightDirection));
         }
         
         #endif
         ...
&lt;/source&gt;

The uniform &lt;code&gt;_World2Receiver&lt;/code&gt; is best set with the help of a small script that should be attached to the shadow-casting object:
&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode()

public var plane : GameObject;

function Update () 
{
   if (null != plane)
   {
      renderer.sharedMaterial.SetMatrix(&quot;_World2Receiver&quot;, 
         plane.renderer.worldToLocalMatrix);
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
The script requires the user to specify the shadow-receiving plane object and sets the uniform &lt;code&gt;_World2Receiver&lt;/code&gt; accordingly.

===Complete Shader Code===
For the complete shader code we improve the performance by noting that the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; coordinate of a matrix-vector product is just the dot product of the second row (i.e. the first when starting with 0) of the matrix and the vector. Furthermore, we improve the robustness by not moving the vertex when it is below the plane, neither when the light is directed upwards. Additionally, we try to make sure that the shadow is on top of the plane with this instruction:

&lt;code&gt;Offset -1.0, -2.0&lt;/code&gt;

This reduces the depth of the rasterized triangles a bit such that they always occlude other triangles of approximately the same depth.

The first pass of the shader renders the shadow-casting object while the second pass renders the projected shadow. In an actual application, the first pass could be replaced by one or more passes to compute the lighting of the shadow-casting object.

&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
Shader &quot;GLSL planar shadow&quot; {
   Properties {
      _Color (&quot;Object's Color&quot;, Color) = (0,1,0,1)
      _ShadowColor (&quot;Shadow's Color&quot;, Color) = (0,0,0,1)
   }
   SubShader {
      Pass {      
         Tags { &quot;LightMode&quot; = &quot;ForwardBase&quot; } // rendering of object
 
         GLSLPROGRAM
 
         // User-specified properties
         uniform vec4 _Color; 
 
         #ifdef VERTEX
 
         void main()
         {                                
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
 
         #endif
 
         #ifdef FRAGMENT
 
         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = _Color;
         }
       
         #endif

         ENDGLSL
      }

      Pass {   
         Tags { &quot;LightMode&quot; = &quot;ForwardBase&quot; } 
            // rendering of projected shadow
         Offset -1.0, -2.0 
            // make sure shadow polygons are on top of shadow receiver
            
         GLSLPROGRAM

         // User-specified uniforms
         uniform vec4 _ShadowColor;
         uniform mat4 _World2Receiver; // set by script

         // The following built-in uniforms ) 
         // are also defined in &quot;UnityCG.glslinc&quot;, 
         // i.e. one could #include &quot;UnityCG.glslinc&quot;

         #ifdef FRAGMENT
         
         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = _ShadowColor;
         }
         
         #endif

         ENDGLSL
      }
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Further Improvements of the Fragment Shader===
There are a couple of things that could be improved, in particular in the fragment shader: 
* Fragments of the shadow that are outside of the rectangular plane object could be removed with the &lt;code&gt;discard&lt;/code&gt; instruction, which was discussed in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Cutaways}}. 
* If the plane is textured, this texturing could be integrated by using only local vertex coordinates for the texture lookup (also in the shader of the plane object) and specifying the texture of the plane as a shader property of the shadow-casting object.
* Soft shadows could be faked by computing the lighting of the plane in this shader and attenuating it depending on the angle of the surface normal vector of the shadow-casting object to the light direction similar to the approach in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Silhouette Enhancement}}.

===Summary===
Congratulations, this is the end of this tutorial. We have seen:
* How to project a vertex in the direction of light onto a plane.
* How to implement this technique to project a shadow onto a plane.

=== Further Reading ===
If you still want to learn more 
*about the model transformation, the view transformation, and the projection, you should read the description in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}.
*about setting up a projection matrix to project the shadow, you could read Section 9.4.1 of the SIGGRAPH '98 Course “Advanced Graphics Programming Techniques Using OpenGL” organized by Tom McReynolds, which is available [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.165.9026&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf online].

==Law Of Variation==
{{Rquote|right|fly like a butterfly sting like a bee|Muhammad Ali}}

&lt;noinclude&gt;__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

===Intent===
To maintain the viewer's interest and maximize the emotional effects.

===Also Known As===
Avoid cliché, Avoid Stereotypes, Develop Symbol systems, Rhythm, Intensification, Irony,

===Motivation===
If for some reason the viewer's interest is lost, the easiest fix is to introduce change. This applies to almost any aspect of screenwriting.

===Applicability===

*Emotions
:*Emotional Highs and Lows (as discussed below)
*Exposition
:*Transpose Exposition and action
*Scenes
:*Long and Short scenes
*Conflict
:*Present opposing points of view

===Structure===
*Variation – do not repeat, recycle material, adopt clichés, use stereotypes, change scene length.
*Intensification – conflict, action, risks, stakes, pace, and intensity all need to become more intensive.
*Reverse Expectation – &quot;fly like a butterfly sting like a bee&quot;; before success, the deepest abyss.
*Surprise – the unexpected is the acme of variation.
*Maximize - the scope of variation and you will be maximizing its effect. 

====Technique 1. Inside Outside====
Follow an indoors scene with an outdoors scene.

{{:Patterns Of Screen Writing/ex}}

====Technique 2. Short Long====
Follow an short scene with a long scene.

{{:Patterns Of Screen Writing/ex}}

====Technique 3. Action Exposition====
Follow action with a exposition.

{{:Patterns Of Screen Writing/ex}}

====Technique 4. Emotional Highs And Lows====
* Maximise the emotional effects of scenes by planning a sequence of increasing climaxes.
* As you build up a climax use a wide mix of emotional effects.

{{:Patterns Of Screen Writing/ex}}

====Technique 5. Covert Overt====
Show and later explain. This technique is used in some of the greatest movies. The moral message is dramatised subtly symbolically in several ways. Once the viewer has become emotional invested in the premise, it will be restated enunciated explicitly, unequivocaly in dialogue or voiceover. The latter version of the message might be controversial, but the use of variation helps to carry it past the viewers resistance.

{{:Patterns Of Screen Writing/ex}}

====Technique 6. Character's strength and Weakness====
To make a character more accessible to the audience you need to show incidents in which expose his strength his weakness and how he develops to over come his weakness. This variation of success and failure due to a character flaw is another element whose variation should be planed to increase the viewer's stakes. Such incidents should have a unifying theme and should refer to the moral premise.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Q: Why students have no interest for study?		
A: The reason is that their consciousness is blocked. Their minds are not dirty but empty. The mind has to be filled with knowledge. The teacher, master or guru opens the blockage. He has the power to open the chakras in the body by his will-power, by giving his ‘knowledge’ to the students.
When the student gets ‘the self of the teacher’ in their self then the blockage of ignorance is removed permanently. Then there will be an interest for study. He or she will choose ‘what I want to be in my life.’ He or she will choose their careers.

Q: How to increase love for study?	
A: Again ‘consciousness’ is that which removes the darkness and brings the light in the mind. Then the love will increase as ‘the self of teacher’ goes in the self of student in the form of knowledge, and ‘love’ for study will increase. If you know what is good and that is your need, then the love has to increase for it is natural.
If you really love the teacher then the knowledge becomes like the attraction of a beautiful flower, then the love for study will increase.</text>

      <comment>/* PostgreSQL database configuration */ th-&gt;nd</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== PostgreSQL database configuration ==

The performance of OpenClinica is highly dependent on the performance of PostgreSQL.  PostgreSQL is initially configured to use a small amount of memory, altering options to increase the memory used can improve the performance significantly, especially on large CRFs.

Open PostgreSQL admin. Select Tools, Server configuration, postgresql.conf

The options below are for a Windows server primarily running OpenClinica and optionally Tomcat with 2GB+ memory and plenty of disk space.  This can also be used for developer machines with similar specs.

Alter the following options (remembering to tick the boxes to enable them), the instructions includes comments after the hash characters:

    max_connections = 200
    shared_buffers = 512MB #1/4 your RAM, with a max of 512MB
    effective_cache_size = 1GB #1/2 your RAM
    checkpoint_segments= 32
    checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
    autovacuum = on
    work_mem = 16MB #1/32nd of shared_buffers above
    maintenance_work_mem= 256MB
    wal_sync_method = fsync_writethrough    # previously fsync (commented)
    wal_buffers = 16MB
    random_page_cost = 3.0

On a Linux machine with 2GB+ memory and plenty of disk space, the configuration is the same, except for two differences:

    shared_buffers = 32MB      # the Linux kernel frequently doesn't support values over this
    wal_sync_method = fdatasync    # leave as default

In Windows, typing ‘services’ into the search box above the Windows Orb allows you access to the services running on your machine to restart PostgreSQL (otherwise it will restart when you next restart your computer).

Numeric fields

#OpenClinica stores numbers as strings, so will happily store both .72 and 0.72 (though they are equivalent) as they both validate as numbers.
#When defining a numeric field in a CRF, note that the width of a decimal field includes the space required for the decimal point.  So 4(2) [width:4; 2 decimal places] will accommodate 9.72, but not 11.72.  11.72 would require a 5(2) definition.  It may be simpler to define the field width as w(2), and rely on the range to limit the results.

{{cquote|What hopes and fears does this scientific method imply for mankind? I do not think that this is the right way to put the question. Whatever this tool in the hand of man will produce depends entirely on the nature of the goals alive in this mankind. Once the goals exist, scientific method furnishes means to realize them. Yet it cannot furnish the very goals. The scientific method itself would not have led anywhere, it would not even have been born without a passionate striving for clear understanding||Albert Einstein}}

==Lesson Objectives==
* Briefly examine the history of science and the scientific method.
* Describe the steps involved in the scientific method, and develop an appreciation for the value of the scientific method.
* Recognize that in some cases not all the steps in the scientific method occur, or they do not occur in a specific order.
* Explain the necessity of experimental controls, and recognize their presence in experiments.

==Historical Comparisons==
===Introduction to Science===
What is science? Is it a list of marvelous inventions and how they work? Or is it a list of theories about matter and energy and biological systems? Or is science a subject that
you learn by carrying out activities in a laboratory? Science is all of these, but it is also something even more basic. Science is a method of thinking that allows us to discover how
the world around us works.

To begin this study of one form of science, we will review the last 3,000 years in the history of human transportation, communication, and medicine. The following summary lists
humankind's accomplishments in these areas during three periods in the last 3,000 years.

===Transportation in 1000 B.C.===
In 1000 B.C., people could transport themselves and their goods by walking, riding an animal, or by riding in a cart pulled by an animal (Figure 1.1). Crossing water, people could paddle a boat or have an animal walk beside the river and pull the boat (Figure 1.2). These methods of transportation required muscle power, either human muscles or animal muscles.

[[File:Egyptian-Chariot.png|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 1.1''': A horse-drawn Egyptian chariot.  Chariots originated in Mesopotamia around 3000 B.C.]]

A few societies had designed rowboats or sailboats, which used muscle power or the force of the wind to move the boat. These early means of transportation were very limited in terms of speed and therefore, also limited in terms of distances traveled. The sail and rowboats were used on rivers and inland seas, but were not ocean-going vessels.

[[File:Model of a greek trireme.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 1.2''': A photo of a wooden model of a Greek ship that has both sails and oars.]]

===Transportation in 1830===
By the year 1830, people were still walking and riding in carts pulled by animals. Iron ore was moved along canals by animals pulling barges. American pioneers crossed the United States in covered wagons pulled by animals (Figure 1.3). Large cities had streetcars pulled by horses (Figure 1.4). Ocean crossing was accomplished in sailing ships. The only improvement in transportation was the addition of springs and padded seats to carts and wagons to make the ride less jolting. In the period from 1000 B.C. to 1830, a span of 2,830 years (about 100 generations of people), there were ''no significant changes'' in the mode of human transportation.

===Transportation in 1995===
By the year 1995, steam engines, gasoline engines, automobiles, propeller-driven and jet engines, locomotives, nuclear-powered ships, and inter-planetary rocket ships were invented (Figure 1.5). In all industrialized countries, almost anyone could own an automobile and travel great distances in very short times.

[[File:Shopping list chiseled on a rock.jpg|frame|right|'''Figure 1.6''': Shopping list chiseled on a rock.]]
In the mid-1800s, several months were required to travel from Missouri to California by covered wagon and the trip was made at considerable risk to the traveler’s life. In 1995, an average family could travel this same distance easily in two days and in relative safety. An ordinary person in 1995 probably traveled a greater distance in one year than an ordinary person in 1830 did in an entire lifetime. The significant changes in the means of transportation in the 165 years between 1830 and 1995 (perhaps 5 generations) were phenomenal.

===Communication in 1000 B.C.===
Essentially, people’s only means of communicating over large distances (more than 15 miles) in 1000 B.C. was to send hand-carried messages (Figure 1.6). Some societies, for short distances, had developed the use of smoke signals, light signals, or drum signals, but these methods were useless for long distances. Since the means of communicating required hand-carried messages, the speed of communication was limited by the speed of transportation. Sending messages over distances of 1,000 miles could require several weeks and even then delivery was not guaranteed.

===Communication in 1830===
[[File:Pony express.jpg|200px|left|thumb|'''Figure 1.7''': A Pony Express rider, circa 1861.]]
By the year 1830, people's means of communication over large distances was still the hand-carried message. While the paper and ink used to write the message had been improved, it still had to be hand-carried. In the United States, communication between New York and San Francisco required more than a month. When a new president was elected, Californians would not know who it was for a couple of months after the election.

For a short period of time, the Pony Express was set up and could deliver a letter from St. Louis, Missouri to Sacramento, California in eleven days, which was amazing at the time (Figure 1.7). The means of communication in 1830 was essentially the same as in 1000 B.C.

===Communication in 1995===
By the year 1995, the telegraph, telephone, radio, television, optical fibers, and communication satellites were invented (Figure 1.8). People could communicate almost anywhere in the industrialized world instantaneously. Now, when a U.S. president is elected, people around the globe know the name of the new president the instant the last vote is counted.

[[File:Alias2-keyboard.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 1.8''': A modern cell phone.]]

Astronauts communicate directly between the earth and the moon. An ordinary person in an industrialized country can speak with people around the world while simultaneously watching events occur in real time globally. There have been truly extraordinary changes in people’s ability to communicate in the last 165 years.

===Medical Treatment in 1000 B.C.===
Medical treatment in 1000 B.C. consisted of a few natural herbs and some superstitious chants and dances. The most advanced societies used both sorcerers and herbalists for medical treatment. Some of the natural herbs helped the patient and some did not. Cleaning and bandaging wounds decreased opportunity for infection while some herbs such as sesame oil demonstrated moderate antiseptic properties. Dances, chants, incense burning, and magic spells were absolutely useless in curing illnesses. At some point in time, bloodletting was added to the physician’s repertoire (Figure 1.9). Bloodletting was accomplished by cutting the patient and allowing the blood to drip out or by applying leeches (which doctors often carried with them). However, bloodletting was not helpful to the patient, and in many cases, it was harmful. Bloodletting was flourishing by 500 B.C. and was carried out by both surgeons and barbers. It wasn’t until around 1875 that bloodletting was established as quackery.

[[File:Blood letting.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 1.9''': Physician letting blood from a patient.]]

In those times, for an ordinary person, broken bones went unset and injuries like deep cuts or stab wounds were often fatal due to infection. Infant mortality was high and it was common for at least one child in a family to die before adulthood. The death of the mother in childbirth was also quite common.

In the Middle Ages, knowledge of germs, hygiene, and contagion was non-existent. People who were seriously ill might have their disease blamed on the planets going out of line (astrology) or &quot;bad odors&quot;, or retribution for sins, or an imbalance in body fluids. Cures could involve anything from magic spells, bleeding, sweating, and vomiting to re-balance bodily fluids. Between 1340 AD and 1348 AD, the Black Death (bubonic plague) was responsible for killing in the vicinity of half the population of Europe. The bacterium causing the disease was carried by fleas, but, of course, none of this was known by the physicians of the time. Efforts to stop the plague included burning incense to eliminate &quot;bad odors&quot;, causing loud noises to chase the plague away (the constant ringing of bells or firing of cannons), and a number of people used self-flagellation to attempt to cure the disease.

===Medical Treatment in 1830===
Medical treatment in 1830 remained in the form of natural herbs and bloodletting. During this time, the ability to set broken bones and to amputate limbs was also developed. Amputation saved many lives from infection and gangrene. Gangrene occurs when the blood supply to tissue is interrupted and the tissue dies. The dead tissue remains part of the body, invites infection, and causes death as the poisons from the rotting tissue are carried through the body. Once gangrene afflicted an arm or leg, the poison from the limb would eventually kill the patient. During the American Civil War (1861 - 1863), a common means
of treatment for wounds in field hospitals was amputation. Along with amputation was the ability to cauterize wounds to stop bleeding.

Even though bloodletting did not help patients, it continued in use through 1830. There is a tale (which may or may not be true) that George Washington was suffering from pneumonia and his doctors removed so much blood trying to cure him that they actually caused his death.

===Medical Treatment in 1995===
By 1995, medical science had discovered chemical medicines, antiseptic procedures, surgery, and probably most important of all, vaccination, the ability to prevent disease rather than cure it after it had been contracted (Figure 1.10).

[[File:Vaccination.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 1.10''': Receiving a vaccination.]]

Diseases that had killed and crippled hundreds of thousands of people in the past are seldom heard of today (polio, smallpox, cholera, bubonic plague, etc.). These diseases have been controlled by scientific understanding of their causes and carriers and by vaccination. Average life expectancy has nearly doubled in the last 165 years. Both infant mortality and death during childbirth rates have dropped to less than 25% of what they were in 1830.

==Methods of Learning About Nature==
===Opinion, Authority, and Superstition===
Why did humans make so little progress in the 2,800 years before 1830 and then such incredible progress in the 160 years after?

Socrates (469 B.C. - 399 B.C.), Plato (427 B.C. - 347 B.C.), and Aristotle (384 B.C. - 322 B.C.) are three of the most famous Greek philosophers. Plato was a student of Socrates and Aristotle was a student of Plato. These three were probably the greatest thinkers of their time. Aristotle's views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship and his influence extended into the Renaissance (14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century). Aristotle's opinions were the authority on nature until well into the 1300s.

Unfortunately, many of Aristotle's opinions were incorrect. Aristotle was, without a doubt, a brilliant man, however, he used a method for determining the nature of the physical world that is inadequate for that task. His method was logical thinking, not making observations in the natural world. This led to many errors in Aristotle’s thinking on nature. Let's consider just two of Aristotle's opinions as examples.

In Aristotle’s opinion, men were bigger and stronger than women, and therefore, it was logical that men would have more teeth than women. Therefore, Aristotle concluded it was a true fact that men had more teeth than women. Apparently, it never entered his mind to actually look into the mouths of both genders and count their teeth. Had he done so, he would have found that men and women have exactly the same number of teeth.

In terms of physical science, Aristotle thought about dropping two balls of exactly the same size and shape but of different masses to see which one would strike the ground first. In his mind, it was clear that the heavier ball would fall faster than the lighter one and he concluded that this was a law of nature. Once again, he did not consider doing an experiment to see which ball fell faster. It was logical to him, and in fact, it still seems logical. If someone told you that the heavier ball would fall faster, you would have no reason to disbelieve it. In fact, it is not true and the best way to prove this is to try it. Eighteen centuries later, Galileo decided to actually get two balls of different masses, but with the same size and shape, and drop them off a building (according to legend, the Leaning Tower of Pisa), and actually see which one hit the ground first. When Galileo actually did the experiment, he discovered, by observation, that the two balls hit the ground at exactly the same time. Aristotle's opinion was, once again, incorrect. The method of the philosopher, pure logic, is more appropriate for the unobservable, that is, for studying things outside the realm of science.

[[File:Pisa experiment.png|center|Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment]]

In the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries, innovative thinkers were developing a new way to discover the nature of the world around them. They were developing a method that relied upon making observations of phenomena and insisting that their explanations of the nature of the phenomena corresponded to the observations they made. In order to do this, they had to overcome the opinions of the ancient Greeks, the authority of the church, and the superstitions of ordinary people.

In the opinion of the ancient Greeks, the earth was the center of the universe and did not move, while the sun, moon, planets, and stars revolved around the Earth in orbits. The astronomer Ptolemy (around 150 A.D.) observed the positions of the planets and recognized that the positions where he observed the planets did not match up with the positions predicted by the orbits of the Greeks. Ptolemy designed new orbits that had circles within circles and complicated retrograde motion (planets moving backward in their orbits at certain times). His descriptions came closer but still could not accurately predict where the
heavenly orbs would be on a given night. It wasn’t until Nicolaus Copernicus (1473 - 1543) suggested a heliocentric (sun-centered) system that the positions of the planets came close to matching predictions. Copernicus was hesitant to publish his ideas&amp;mdash;some say because he feared ridicule from his peers and others say because he feared persecution by the church—but eventually, he sent his work for publication just before his death.

Copernicus' heliocentric theory remained latent for the next 50 years until the it was supported by a scientist named Giordano Bruno, who was promptly prosecuted and burned at the stake by Cardinal Bellarmini in 1600. The heliocentric theory was against the beliefs of the church, and the majority, at the time. The most famous supporter of the Copernican system was Galileo Galilei (1564 - 1642) who developed an improved telescope (1610) and turned it toward the sky. Galileo published a small work describing what he had seen with his telescope and how his observations supported the Copernican theory. His book was banned by the church in 1616, and Galileo was instructed not to write about the subject any further. In 1632, Galileo published another work, again supporting the Copernican theory and was arrested and prosecuted by the church. Under threat of death, he was forced to recant, and was punished by house arrest for the remainder of his life.

But the method of learning by experimenting, observing, and hypothesizing had been launched and many scientists would not turn back. There are still supporters of the methods of opinion, authority, and superstition. With free speech, anyone can present a statement as fact, but without standing the test of the scientific method, ''that statement is not science''.

===The Scientific Method===
Scientists frequently list the scientific method as a series of steps, however, not all steps occur in order. The scientific method is listed in a series of steps in Table 1.1 and represented in the flowchart (Figure 1.11) because it makes it easier to study.

{| style=&quot;margin: 10px auto; width:500px;&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

[[File:The Scientific Method.jpg|frame|center|'''Figure 1.11''': Flowchart of the steps in the Scientific Method]]

When the results of several experiments support the hypothesis, you might think that the work is finished. However, for a hypothesis to be useful, it must withstand repeated testing. Other scientists must be able to repeat the experiments using the same materials and conditions and get the same results&amp;mdash;this quality is known as '''reproducibility'''. Scientists submit reports of research to other scientists, usually by publishing an article in a scientific journal, so the work can be verified.

====An Example of the Scientific Method====

Suppose you are required to maintain a large campfire and you are completely unfamiliar with the property of objects that makes them combustible (able to burn). The first step in the scientific method is to define the problem. ''What property of objects make them combustible?''

The next step is to gather data on the problem. So, you begin to collect objects at random and put them into the fire. You must keep good records of what objects were tried and whether or not they burned. Table 1.2 shows a list of organized data (observations).

{| style=&quot;clear:right; float:right; width:250px; margin-left:10px;&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Table 1.3'''
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Will Burn
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Won't Burn
|-

|-

|-
| pencils || marbles
|-
| baseball bat || hubcaps
|-
| broom handle || iron pipes
|-
| &amp;nbsp; || soda bottles
|- 
| &amp;nbsp; || tin cans
|}

The list of organized observations helps because now you can collect only the items on the &quot;will burn&quot; list and not waste the effort of dragging items that won't burn back to the fire. However, you would soon use up all the items on the &quot;will burn&quot; list and it is necessary to guess what property the &quot;will burn&quot; objects have that cause them to burn. If you had that answer, you could bring objects that may not be on the &quot;will burn&quot; list but that have the &quot;will burn&quot; property and keep the fire going.

The third step in the scientific method is to suggest a hypothesis. Your guess about what property the &quot;will burn&quot; objects have that makes them combustible is a hypothesis. Suppose you notice that all the items on the &quot;will burn&quot; list are cylindrical in shape and therefore, you hypothesize that &quot;cylindrical objects burn&quot;. The fourth step in the scientific method is to test your hypothesis. To test this hypothesis, you go out and collect a group of objects that are cylindrical including iron pipes, soda bottles, broom handles, and tin cans. When these cylindrical objects are placed in the fire and most of them don’t burn, you realize your hypothesis is not supported by these new observations. The new observations are the test, and your hypothesis has failed the test. When the new observations fail to support your hypothesis, you reject your original hypothesis, add your new data to (Table 1.3), and make a new hypothesis based on the updated observations list. In the schematic diagram of the scientific method, a failed test returns the scientist to step 3, ''make a new hypothesis''.

Suppose your new hypothesis is &quot;wooden objects burn&quot;. You find this hypothesis more satisfactory since all the wooden object you try will burn. Your confidence may grow that you have discovered a &quot;law of nature&quot;. Even with your somewhat successful theory, you might be ignoring a large stack of old car tires, objects made of fabric or paper, or perhaps containers of petroleum. You can see that even though you are quite satisfied with your theory because it does the job you want it to do, you actually do not have a complete statement on the property of objects that make them burn, because there is still unexamined (and perhaps unknown) evidence. This is often the case in science.

You can see from this example that the ”solution” does not become what we think of as a &quot;fact&quot;, but rather ''becomes a tentatively accepted theory which must undergo continuous testing and perhaps adjustment''. No matter how long a tentative explanation has been accepted, it can be discarded at any time if contradictory observations are found. As long as the theory is consistent with all observations, scientists will continue to use it. When a theory is contradicted by observations, it is discarded or modified to explain the new observations. Even though the terms ''hypothesis'', ''theory'', and ''fact'' are used somewhat interchangeably at times, a theory will continue to be used while it is useful and will be called into question when contradictory evidence is found. Theories never become facts.

One common generalization about theories is that &quot;theories are much easier to disprove than to prove&quot;. A common example is the hypothesis, &quot;all swans are white&quot;. You may observe a thousand white swans and every observation of a white swan supports your hypothesis, but it takes only a single observation of a black swan to disprove that hypothesis. To be an acceptable scientific hypothesis, observations that disprove the hypothesis must be possible. That is, if every conceivable observation supports the hypothesis, then it is not an acceptable scientific hypothesis. To be a scientific hypothesis, it must be possible to refute the concept. This property is known as '''falsifiability'''. Again, things that are unfalsifiable are outside the realm of science.

==Some Basic Terminology==
* A '''hypothesis''' is a guess that is made early in the process of trying to explain some set of observations. There are scientists who object to calling a hypothesis a &quot;guess&quot;. The primary basis for the objection is that someone who has studied the subject under consideration would make a much better guess than someone who was completely ignorant of the field. Perhaps we should say that a hypothesis is an &quot;educated guess&quot;.
* A '''theory''' is an explanation that stands up to everyday use in explaining a set of observations. A theory is not proven and is not a &quot;fact&quot;. A scientific theory must be falsifiable in order to be accepted as a theory.
* A '''law''' describes an observable relationship, that is, observations that occur with a predictable relationship to each other. It is only after experience shows the law to be valid that it is incorporated into the field of knowledge.

==The Scientific Revolution==
The explosion of achievement in the last 160 years was produced by using a new method for learning about nature. This sudden and massive achievement in understanding nature is called the '''Scientific Revolution''' and was produced using the '''scientific method'''.

The British historian, Herbert Butterfield, wrote a book called The Origins of Modern Science. In the preface to the book, Butterfield wrote:

{{cquote|The Revolution in science overturned the authority of not only the Middle Ages but of the ancient world … it ended not only in the eclipse of scholastic philosophy but in the destruction of Aristotelian physics. The Scientific Revolution outshines everything since the rise of Christianity and reduces the Renaissance and Reformation to the rank of mere episodes…}}

The beginning of the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century is known for the drastic changes that occurred in the European approach to science during that period and is known as the Scientific Revolution. This term refers to a completely new era of academic thought in which medieval philosophy was abandoned in favor of innovative methods offered by Galileo and Newton.

{{cquote|Science is best defined as a careful, disciplined, logical search for knowledge about any and all aspects of the universe, obtained by examination of the best available evidence and always subject to correction and improvement upon discovery of better evidence. What's left is magic. And it doesn't work.|||James Randi}}

==What is an Experiment?==
The scientific method requires that observations be made. Sometimes, the phenomenon we wish to observe does not occur in nature or if it does, it is inconvenient for us to observe. Therefore, it is more successful for us to cause the phenomenon to occur at a time and place of our choosing. When we arrange for the phenomenon to occur at our convenience, we can have all our measuring instruments present and handy to help us make observations, and we can control other variables. Causing a phenomenon to occur when and where we want it and under the conditions we want is called an '''experiment'''. When scientists conduct experiments, they are usually seeking new information or trying to verify someone else's data. Classroom experiments often demonstrate and verify information that is already known but
new to the student. When doing an experiment, it is important to set up the experiment so that relationships can be seen clearly. This requires what are called '''experimental controls'''.

==Experimental Controls==
[[File:Fresh and salt water freezing experiment.png|frame|right|'''Figure 1.12''']]
Suppose a scientist, while walking along the beach on a very cold day following a rainstorm, observed two pools of water in bowl shaped rocks near each other. One of the pools was partially covered with ice while the other pool had no ice on it. The unfrozen pool seemed to be formed from seawater splashing up on the rock from the surf, but the other pool was too high for sea water to splash in, so it was more likely to have been formed from rainwater.

The scientist wondered why one pool was partially frozen and not the other since both pools were at the same temperature. By tasting the water (not a good idea), the scientist determined that the unfrozen pool tasted saltier than the partially frozen one. The scientist thought perhaps salt water had a lower freezing point that fresh water and she decided to go home and try an experiment to see if this were true. So far, the scientist has identified a question, gathered a small amount of data, and suggested a hypothesis. In order to test this hypothesis, the scientist will conduct an experiment during which she can make accurate observations.

For the experiment, the scientist prepared two identical containers of fresh water and added some salt to one of them (Figure 1.12). A thermometer was placed in each liquid and these were put in a freezer. The scientist then observed the conditions and temperatures of the two liquids at regular intervals.

The scientist found support for the hypothesis from this experiment; fresh water freezes at a higher temperature than salt water. Much more support would be needed before the scientist would be confident of this hypothesis. Perhaps she would ask other scientists to verify the work.

In the scientist's experiment, it was necessary that she freeze the salt water and fresh water under exactly the same conditions. Why? The scientist was testing whether or not the presence of salt in water would alter its freezing point. It is known that changing air pressure will alter the freezing point of water. In order to conclude that the presence of the salt was what caused the change in freezing point, all other conditions had to be identical. The presence of the salt is called the '''experimental variable''' because it is the only thing allowed to change in the two trials. The fresh water part of the experiment is called the '''experimental control'''. In an experiment, there may be only one variable and the purpose of the control is to guarantee that there is only one variable. The &quot;control&quot; is identical to the &quot;test&quot; except for the experimental variable. Unless experiments are controlled, the results are not valid.

Suppose you wish to determine which brand of microwave popcorn leaves the fewest unpopped kernels. You will need a supply of various brands of microwave popcorn to test and you will need a microwave oven. If you used different brands of microwave ovens with different brands of popcorn, the percentage of unpopped kernels could be caused by the different brands of popcorn, but it could also be caused by the different brands of ovens. Under such circumstances, the experimenter would not be able to conclude confidently whether the popcorn or the oven caused the difference. To eliminate this problem, you must use the same microwave oven for every test. By using the same microwave oven, you control the number of variables in the experiment.

What if you allowed the different samples of popcorn to be cooked at different temperatures? What if you allowed longer heating periods? In order to reasonably conclude that the change in one variable was caused by the change in another specific variable, there must be no other variables in the experiment. All other variables must be kept constant.

==Errors in the Use of the Scientific Method==
The scientific method requires the observation of nature and correspondence between the suggested explanation and the observations. That is, the hypothesis must explain all the observations. Therefore, the scientific method can only work properly when the data (observation list) is not biased. There are several ways in which a biased set of data can be produced. It is always possible for anyone to make an error in observation. A balance can be misread or numbers can be transposed when written down. That is one of the reasons that experiments are run several times and the observations made over and over again. It is also possible that an unrecognized error is present and produces the same error in every experiment. For example, a scientist may be attempting to test normal rainwater, but unknown to him a nearby factory is sending soluble substances out of their smoke stack and the material is contaminating the scientist’s samples. In such a case, the scientist's samples would yield false observations for normal rainwater. Other scientists reproducing the experiment would collect uncontaminated samples and find different results. Multiple testing of the experiment would determine which set of data was flawed. Failing to apply appropriate experimental controls would certainly bias data.

There are also dishonest mistakes that occur when the experimenter collects only supporting data and excludes contradictory observations. There have even been scientists who faked observations to provide support for his/her hypothesis. The attractions of fame and fortune can be hard to resist. For all these reasons, the scientific method requires that experimental results be published and the experiment be repeated by other scientists.

==Lesson Summary==
* Before the development of the scientific method, mankind made only slight achievements in the areas of transportation, communication and medicine.
* Use of the scientific method allowed mankind to make significant achievements in transportation, communication, and medicine.
* The scientific method has been much more successful than the methods of superstition, opinion, and authority.
* The steps in the scientific method are:
*# Identify the problem
*# Gather data (make observations)
*# Suggest a hypothesis
*# Test the hypothesis (experiment)
*# Continue testing or reject the hypothesis and make a new one
* Experimental controls are used to make sure that the only variables in an experiment are the ones being tested.

==Review Questions==
[[File:Penicillium experiment.png|frame|right|'''Figure 1.13''']]
Use the following paragraph to answer the first two questions. In 1928, Sir Alexander Fleming was studying Staphylococcus bacteria growing in culture dishes. He noticed that a mold called Penicillium was also growing in some of the dishes. In Figure 1.13, Petri dish A represents a dish containing only Staphylococcus bacteria. The red dots in dish B represent Penicillium colonies. Fleming noticed that a clear area existed around the mold because all the bacteria grown in this area had died. In the culture dishes without the mold, no clear areas were present. Fleming suggested that the mold was producing a chemical that killed the bacteria. He decided to isolate this substance and test it to see if it would kill bacteria. Fleming grew some Penicillium mold in a nutrient broth. After the mold grew in the broth,
he removed all the mold from the broth and added the broth to a culture of bacteria. All the bacteria died.

# Which of the following statements is a reasonable expression of Fleming’s hypothesis?
#:(a) Nutrient broth kills bacteria.
#:(b) There are clear areas around the Penicillium mold where Staphylococcus doesn't grow.

Gary noticed that two plants which his mother planted on the same day that were the same size when planted were different in size after three weeks. Since the larger plant was in the full sun all day and the smaller plant was in the shade of a tree most of the day, Gary believed the sunshine was responsible for the difference in the plant sizes. In order to test this, Gary bought ten small plants of the size and type. He made sure they had the same size and type of pot. He also made sure they have the same amount and type of soil. Then Gary built a frame to hold a canvas roof over five of the plants while the other five were nearby but out in the sun. Gary was careful to make sure that each plant received exactly the same amount of water and plant food every day.

# Which of the following is a reasonable statement of Gary’s hypothesis?
#:(a) Different plants have different characteristics.
#:(b) Plants that get more sunshine grow larger than plants that get less sunshine.
#:(c) Plants that grow in the shade grow larger.
#:(d) Plants that don’t receive water will die.
#:(e) Plants that receive the same amount of water and plant food will grow the same amount.
# What scientific reason might Gary have for insisting that the container size for the all plants be the same?
#:(a) Gary wanted to determine if the size of the container would affect the plant growth.
#:(b) Gary wanted to make sure the size of the container did not affect differential plant growth in his experiment.
#:(c) Gary want to control how much plant food his plants received.
#:(d) Gary wanted his garden to look organized.
#:(e) There is no possible scientific reason for having the same size containers.
# What scientific reason might Gary have for insisting that all plants receive the same amount of water everyday?
#:(a) Gary wanted to test the effect of shade on plant growth and therefore, he wanted to have no variables other than the amount of sunshine on the plants.
#:(b) Gary wanted to test the effect of the amount of water on plant growth.
#:(c) Gary's hypothesis was that water quality was affecting plant growth.
#:(d) Gary was conserving water.
#:(e) There is no possible scientific reason for having the same amount of water for each plant every day.
# What was the variable being tested in Gary's experiment?
#:(a) the amount of water
#:(b) the amount of plant food
#:(c) the amount of soil
#:(d) the amount of sunshine
#:(e) the type of soil
# Which of the following factors may be varying in Gary’s experimental setup that he did not control?
#:(a) individual plant variation
#:(b) soil temperature due to different colors of containers
#:(c) water loss due to evaporation from the soil
#:(d) the effect of insects which may attack one set of plants but not the other
#:(e) All of the above are possible factors that Gary did not control

When a mosquito sucks blood from its host, it penetrates the skin with its sharp beak and injects an anti-coagulant so the blood will not clot. It then sucks some blood and removes its beak. If the mosquito carries disease-causing microorganisms, it injects these into its host along with the anti-coagulant. It was assumed for a long time that the virus of typhus was injected by the louse when sucking blood in a manner similar to the mosquito. But apparently this is not so. The infection is not in the saliva of the louse, but in the feces. The disease is thought to be spread when the louse feces come in contact with scratches or bite wounds in the host's skin. A test of this was carried out in 1922 when two workers fed infected lice on a monkey taking great care that no louse feces came into contact with the monkey. After two weeks, the monkey had NOT become ill with typhus. The workers then injected the monkey with typhus and it became ill within a few days. Why did the workers inject the monkey with typhus
near the end of the experiment?
:(a) to prove that the lice carried the typhus virus
:(b) to prove the monkey was similar to man
:(c) to prove that the monkey was not immune to typhus
:(d) to prove that mosquitoes were not carriers of typhus
:(e) the workers were mean

Eijkman fed a group of chickens exclusively on rice whose seed coat had been removed (polished rice or white rice). The chickens all developed polyneuritis (a disease of chickens) and died. He fed another group of chickens unpolished rice (rice that still had its seed coat). Not a single one of them contracted polyneuritis. He then gathered the polishings from rice (the seed coats that had been removed) and fed the polishings to other chickens that were sick with polyneuritis. In a short time, the birds all recovered. Eijkman had accurately traced the cause of polyneuritis to a faulty diet. For the first
time in history, a food deficiency disease had been produced and cured experimentally. Which of the following is a reasonable statement of Eijkman’s hypothesis?
:(a) Polyneuritis is a fatal disease for chickens.
:(b) White rice carries a virus for the disease polyneuritis.
:(c) Unpolished rice does not carry the polyneuritis virus.
:(d) The rice seed coat contains a nutrient that provides protection for chickens against polyneuritis.
:(e) None of these is a reasonable statement of Eijkman's hypothesis.

The three questions below relate to the following paragraphs.

Scientist A noticed that in a certain forest area, the only animals inhabiting the region were giraffes. He also noticed that the only food available for the animals was on fairly tall trees and as the summer progressed, the animals ate the leaves high and higher on the trees. The scientist suggested that these animals were originally like all other animals but generations of animals stretching their necks to reach higher up the trees for food, caused the species to grow very long necks.

Scientist B conducted experiments and observed that stretching muscles does NOT cause bones to grow longer nor change the DNA of animals so that longer muscles would be passed on to the next generation. Scientist B, therefore, discarded Scientist A's suggested answer as to why all the animals living in the area had long necks. Scientist B suggested instead that originally many different types of animals including giraffes had lived in the region but only the giraffes could survive when the only food was high in the trees, and so all the other species had left the area.

#Which of the following statements is an interpretation, rather than an observation?
#:A. The only animals living in the area were giraffes.
#:B. The only available food was on tall trees.
#:C. Animals which constantly stretch their necks will grow longer necks.
#:D. A, B, and C are all interpretations.
#:E. A, B, and C are all observations.
# Scientist A's hypothesis was that
#:A. the only animals living in the area were giraffes.
#:B. the only available food was on tall trees.
#:C. animals which constantly stretch their necks will grow longer necks.
#:D. the animals which possess the best characteristics for living in an area, will be the predominant species.
#:E. None of the above are reasonable statements of Scientist A's hypothesis.
# Scientist A's hypothesis being discarded is
#:A. evidence that the scientific method doesn’t always work.
#:B. a result achieved without use of the scientific method.
#:C: an example of what happened before the scientific method was invented.
#:D. an example of the normal functioning of the scientific method.
#:E. an unusual case.

When a theory has been known for a long time, it becomes a law.
:(a) True
:(b) False

During Pasteur's time, anthrax was a widespread and disastrous disease for livestock. Many people whose livlihood was raising livestock lost large portions of their herds to this disease. Around 1876, a horse doctor in eastern France named Louvrier, claimed to have intvented a cure for anthrax. The influential men of the community supported Louvrier's claim to have cured hundreds of cows of anthrax. Pasteur went to Louvrier's hometown to evaluate the cure. The cure was explained to Pasteur as a multi-step process during which: 1) the cow was rubbed vigorously to make her as hot as possible; 2) long gashes were cut into the cows skin and turpentine was poured into the cuts; 3) an inch-thick coating of cow manure mixed with hot vinegar was plastered onto the cow and the cow was completely wrapped in a cloth. Since some cows recover from anthrax with no treatment, performing the cure on a single cow would not be conclusive, so Pasteur proposed an experiment to test Louvrier's cure. Four healthy cows were to be injected with anthrax microbes, and after the cows became ill, Louvrier would pick two of the cows (A and B) and perform his cure on them while the other two cows (C and D) would be left untreated. The experiment was performed and after a few days, one of the untreated cows died and one of them got better. Of the cows treated by Louvrier's cure, one cow died and one got better. In this experiment, what was the purpose of infecting cows C and D?
:(a) So that Louvrier would have more than two cows to choose from.
:(b) To make sure the injection actually contained anthrax.
:(c) To serve as experimental controls (a comparison of treated to untreated cows).
:(d) To kill as many cows as possible.

A hypothesis is
:(a) a description of a consistent pattern in observations.
:(b) an observation that remains constant.
:(c) a theory that has been proven.
:(d) a tentative explanation for a phenomenon.

A number of people became ill after eating oysters in a restaurant. Which of the following statements is a hypothesis about this occurrence?
:(a) Everyone who ate oysters got sick.
:(b) People got sick whether the oysters they ate were raw or cooked.
:(c) Symptoms included nausea and dizziness.
:(d) The cook felt really bad about it.
:(e) Bacteria in the oysters may have caused the illness.

Which statement best describes the reason for using experimental controls?
:(a) Experimental controls eliminate the need for large sample sizes.
:(b) Experimental controls eliminate the need for statistical tests.
:(c) Experimental controls reduce the number of measurements needed.
:(d) Experimental controls allow comparison between groups that are different in only one independent variable.

A student decides to set up an experiment to determine the relationship between the growth rate of plants and the presence of detergent in the soil. He sets up 10 seed pots. In five of the seed pots, he mixes a precise amount of detergent with the soil and the other five seed pots have no detergent in the soil. The 5 seed pots with detergent are placed in the sun and the five seed pots with no detergent are placed in the shade. All 10 seed pots receive the same amount of water and the same number and type of seeds. He grows the plants for two months and charts the growth every two days. What is wrong with his experiment?
:(a) The student has too few pots.
:(b) The student has two independent variables.
:(c) The student has two dependent variables.
:(d) The student has no experimental control on the soil.

A scientist plants two rows of corn for experimentation. She puts fertilizer on row 1 but does not put fertilizer on row 2. Both rows receive the same amount of sun and water. She checks the growth of the corn over the course of five months. What is acting as the control in this experiment?
:(a) Corn without fertilizer.
:(b) Corn with fertilizer.
:(c) Amount of water.
:(d) Height of corn plants.

If you have a control group for your experiment, which of the following is true?
:(a) There can be more than one difference between the control group and the test group, but not more three differences or else the experiment is invalid.
:(b) The control group and the test group may have many differences between them.
:(c) The control group must be identical to the test group except for one variable.
:(d) None of these are true.

      <comment>/* Writing Rules */ Adding note on repeating groups</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Recent improvements in rule assignment ==

As of version 3.1.x, OpenClinica allows rules with [https://docs.openclinica.com/3.1/rules/creating-rules#content-title-4383 relative paths] that can be assigned to every instance of a given CRF.  Previous versions (3.0.x and earlier) required rules to be assigned to each Event and CRF, so a greater number of assignments had to be created and tested.

== Writing Rules ==

*In rules, the operators ‘ne’,’eq’ etc. and the logical operators ‘and’ and ‘or’ are case sensitive (so writing rules containing ‘AND’ or ‘EQ’ results in errors).

*There are bugs in Openclinica when using brackets in rule expressions - the error &quot;OCRERR_0006 : Syntax Error, Missing right parenthesis.&quot; occurs when a &quot;variable name is immediately adjacent to the right-hand bracket&quot;, see https://issuetracker.openclinica.com/view.php?id=4195#bugnotes

*Note that you don’t need to specify a specific version of a CRF in a rule, you can miss off ‘_V1’ from the target CRF end, references to F_LIRAGLUTIDE_V1 can be changed to F_LIRAGLUTIDE.

*Numeric comparisons between field may only be performed where both fields are numeric - e.g. a string field that frequently contains a number can't be compared with a numeric field. e.g. Trying to use the lte operator with a string and numeric field results in the error: 'OCRERR_0001 : Logic Error, ITEM_NAME and null cannot be used with the LESS_THAN_EQUAL operator.'

*For rules on repeating group items, ensure in the target you specify either the integer row number or the keyword '[ALL]', as per the [https://docs.openclinica.com/3.1/rules/creating-rules#content-title-4383 creating rules documentation], e.g. F_BCFALLSDIARY.IG_BCFAL_FALLSDIARY[ALL].I_BCFAL_QSFALLS

=== Testing Rules ===

Rules are more complex to test than ranges as there are frequently more than one per CRF section, and they may need to be tested one at a time, and in several ways.

When testing rules, discrepancy notes are only created if the rule triggers, and then Save is pressed with the rule still triggered (the data not corrected).

The time taken to test can be reduced if care is taken when writing test documents to:
#Avoid triggering rules the second time
#Ensure that a rule on a different field is triggered when save is pressed the second time

If you follow these guidelines, every time that Save is pressed, a new rule is triggered and tested.

How to do this:
#Set up the a rule on one field in a section to fail, then press save
#Alter the data to ensure the rule on the first field doesn't trigger again, and alter data so that a rule on a second field triggers
#Press save again - the first rule wasn't triggered, so no discrepancies will be created, and a second rule is triggered, so the section doesn't change.

=== Reusing Rules and Tests ===

If we use standardised CRFs ([[OpenClinica_User_Manual/CRFandOIDissues|Standards]]), we can also re-use standardised rules and tests for them.

=== Errors during testing ===
There are a number of errors that may be seen during testing rules.

==== Incorrect group ====
This error appears in the stdout_*.log when a rule has been triggered (the browser shows the [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/AnErrorHasOccured|OpenClinica Generic Error page]]), but the target is incorrect, and contains the wrong group:
&lt;pre&gt;
java.lang.NullPointerException
	at org.akaza.openclinica.logic.rulerunner.RuleRunner.prepareEmailContents(RuleRunner.java:120)
&lt;/pre&gt;
e.g. Set as:
SE_BC1VISIT.F_BC1VISIT.IG_BC1VI_UNGROUPED.I_BC1VI_TIABLCON
Rather than:
SE_BC1VISIT.F_BC1VISIT.IG_BC1VI_INCLUSIONCRITERIA.I_BC1VI_TIABLCON

      <comment>/* Avoiding problems with rule OIDs */ missed a couple</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Avoiding problems with rule OIDs ==

The XML that defines rules refers to OIDs, the system's internal codes for CRFs, Events and Item Names.  Problems arise if your study set up causes these OIDs to be generated randomly at the time of CRF upload (https://docs.openclinica.com/3.1/rules/oid-overview).  If the OIDs on your live server differ from your test server you will need a different rule XML for each.  You can simplify the creation of rules in your study by following procedures and naming conventions that ensure that OIDs in the study are predictable.

=== Problems when uploading CRFs ===

==== If you overwrite existing CRF versions in the database ====

Don't upload a new version '0.3' over '0.3', as random OIDs are generated for overwritten items.  Either:
*change the version number of the new CRF in the CRF tab before uploading or 
*delete the currently uploaded version before uploading (see 'Working around problems during development and test' below if the CRF is referenced by an event or has been used for data entry).
The new CRF's OIDs should match those of the currently uploaded version.  Note that in a rule you don’t need to specify a specific version of a CRF, you can miss off ‘_V3’ from the target CRF end, references to F_LIRAGLUTIDE_V3 can be changed to F_LIRAGLUTIDE.

==== If you reorder items ====

If a new CRF version reorders existing items, then the items may be given random OIDs.

To avoid this problem, ideally you would simply delete the current version in the database, but sometimes that version can't be deleted, as it is referenced by an event or has data entry.  See 'Working around problems during development and test' below.

=== Working around problems during development and test === 

During development there are sometimes issues when uploading a CRF to the database, either:
*If items are reordered (which causes problems with OIDs) or
*If items change significantly and OpenClinica displays a warning message during upload, such as:
&lt;pre&gt;The item: xyz in your spreadsheet already exists in the DB with different response options/text. You cannot code an existing response option with a different text, or code an existing response text with a different option. Please check it and upload your spreadsheet again&lt;/pre&gt;

In these cases you can either:
*Delete the CRF version currently in the database (sometimes this isn't possible because it is referenced by an event or data entry has started using it)
*Change the item names for significantly changed items (so OpenClinica sees the items as new)
*Upload new versions of the CRF to the database removing all conflicting items.  Point any events to the new version.  Delete all old versions containing the conflicting items.  Then upload a version with updated items.

If the preferred option is to delete the items from all versions of the CRF, this can be done by:
#Create and upload a version without the items with a temporary version number, e.g. 0.3a.  This version can be very stripped-down to allow the maximum number of changes, e.g. a single items with a temporary unique item name
#Alter any events referencing old versions to use the temporary version (e.g. 0.3a)
#Delete all data entry for old versions of the CRF.  When you attempt to delete an old version OpenClinica displays the ids where data entry has started with the version of the CRF.  Use this id to find the scheduled event where the CRF that needs to be deleted is.  The data entry using the CRF version should be listed in the CRFs within the event ready for deletion.  The 'Delete' button will appear for the CRF if at least one page of the CRF is complete (if not, complete at least one page with dummy data such that the 'Delete' button appears).
#Delete old CRF versions (e.g. 0.1 and 0.2)
#Upload the replacement version (e.g. 0.3)
#Alter any events to use the replacement version (e.g. 0.3)
#Delete the temporary version (e.g. 0.3a)

=== Issues when deleting CRFs (OpenClinica 3.1 and later) ===

Note: This issue only applies in OpenClinica 3.1.2 and later (3.0.3 does not have this issue).

There should be no issues deleting CRFs when there are no rules in the database.  However, be aware when deleting CRFs that are referenced by existing rules, that these rules may be left orphaned (https://issuetracker.openclinica.com/view.php?id=16336).  You may need to give your rules new OIDs and re-upload them (technical explanation: This occurs because within the database, the rule_set table's item_id column doesn't enforce referential integrity when referencing the item table).

Here's an SQL query to identify affected rules:
&lt;pre&gt;
select distinct rule.id,rule.oc_oid,rule.rule_expression_id from rule_set,rule_set_rule,rule where 
rule_set_rule.rule_id = rule.id and
rule_set_rule.rule_set_id = rule_set.id and
not exists (select 1 from item where item.item_id=rule_set.item_id) order by rule.id;
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Naming conventions to avoid problems ===
==== Conventions for CRFs where the server hosts multiple trials ====
#Define a short (2 character), unique trial code for each study on the server, e.g. 'AA'
#The first 2 characters of a CRF name should be the short trial code as CRFs from multiple trials are grouped together when viewing CRFs (it also helps avoid overlaps with CRF names from other trials).
#The first 2 characters of a rule OID should be the short trial code as rule OIDs need to be unique within a server (e.g. AALXORLTICK includes the prefix 'AA').  This avoids rule OIDs in similar events such as Adverse Events from overlapping.
#Event names need to be unique within a server (e.g. 'AA Concomitant Medications', otherwise OIDs will be given random suffixes.  Events should be given prefixes that match the prefixes of CRFs.  This avoids overlaps for common events such as Adverse Events.

==== Conventions for Events, CRFs and Items ====

#The first 5 characters (ignoring spaces) of CRFs should be unique within the server.  These characters are used to create the group name for items in the CRF that are ungrouped, as well as composite ItemNames for items.  If you have a series of CRFs named 'Visit 1', 'Visit 2' etc. you may want to name them by placing the number before the string, e.g. '1 Visit' and '2 Visit' etc..
#If the trial is to be hosted on a server hosting multiple trials, a CRF named 'Visit 1' in a study with the short trial code of 'AA' could be named 'AA 1 Visit' (see 'Naming conventions for CRFs where the server hosts multiple trials', above).
#The first 20 characters of Item names should be unique.  In practice this means the first 13 characters of item names need to be unique (12 in 3.0.4 and above), as the first 7 characters of item names are based on the CRF name, e.g. the item name starts “I_XXXX_”, where XXXX is the first four characters of the CRF name (five characters in 3.0.4 and above).
#When exporting to XML, the SASFormatName contains the itemname truncated to 8 characters in length (as of OpenClinica 3.0).  So, if you plan to import the data into SAS, you may wish to restrict your itemnames to 8 characters.
#When naming an Item name used in a calculation, you may want to consider using a user-friendly name as the Item name is displayed to the user when the field is empty.

Engineering has had an impact on all aspects of society. Look around you and notice all of the things that have been made by humans. Through designing, manufacturing, testing, or selling, an engineer probably had something to do with most of these human-made items.

==Great Engineering Achievements==
{{Robox|theme=8|title=Activity}}
Can you think of some great engineering achievements? Take a few moments to make a list of some of the most important things engineers have developed. It might help to think of things that have changed the way that people live. For example, a century ago people relied on candles and lanterns for light. How has this changed? When you are finished making a list, share it with someone else and find out what they think are the most important engineering accomplishments.

Now that you have a list of great engineering achievements, see what others have identified as the most important accomplishments of this century. Below, you will find several figures, each representing a significant engineering accomplishment of the twentieth century. Look at each figure carefully and try to determine what engineering accomplishment it represents. Check to see if you have the accomplishment on your list. If it is not there, add it.
{{Robox/Close}}

The National Academy of Engineering (NAE) has identified the top twenty engineering achievements of the twentieth century. The NAE has created a webpage (http://www.greatachievements.org/) which describes these achievements and the impacts that these achievements have in the everyday lives of people. Many of these achievements are so commonly used in our society that we take them for granted. We describe ten of the twenty
achievements; the other ten achievements can be found at the NAE webpage.

Figure 8, showing the bright lights of the Pudong New Area in Shanghai, China, and Figure 9, showing lights visible from space at night, represent electrification. Electrification is the process of making electricity available to large numbers of people. We use electricity not only for light, but also to power machinery, instruments, and appliances. How many electric or battery powered devices do you use in a day? Without electrification, we would not have any of these devices today.

[[File:View of Pudong(Shanghai).jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 2.8''': The skyline of the Pudong New Area in Shanghai, China at night.]]
[[File:Earthlights dmsp.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 2.9''': The lights of major cities around the world are visible from space at night.]]

Figure 10 shows a rather high-tech looking automobile. The first cars produced in the United States were sold in 1901, primarily as novelties to the wealthy. However, by 1920 automobiles were mass-produced. Prior to the automobile people worked close to where they lived; one had to live in the city in order to work in the city, as the largest distance that it was practical to travel regularly was only a few miles. A farm or a factory that was not close to a city could not easily transport goods to market. Thus the automobile is credited with freeing people from the limitations of geography and with greatly contributing to raising incomes and wealth.

[[File:Toyota Prototype.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 2.10''': A Toyota concept car.]]

Figure 11 shows a jet aircraft and its contrails as it flies high in the sky. Airplanes further freed people from the constraints of geography by making rapid long-distance travel possible. Airplanes are also responsible for advancing a global economy.

[[File:Kondensstreifen2.JPG|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 2.11''': A high flying jet aircraft leaves contrails in the sky. A contrail is the white streak (or cloud) formed behind a high-flying aircraft’s engines.]]
[[File:Drinking water.jpg|thumb|150px|'''Figure 2.12''': Clean drinking water flowing from a faucet.]]

Figure 12 shows a water faucet, and represents the supply and distribution of clean water. Clean water has had a significant impact on human life. During the 1700s and 1800s, thousands of people died from diseases including cholera, typhus, and waterborne typhoid fever, and thousands upon thousands became ill. A clean water supply and good distribution not only improved health, but also contributed to the growth of new cities, the development of hydropower, the improvement of crop growth, and the availability of water recreation.

Figure 13 shows an electronics workshop. Our world is filled with electronic devices, including computers, mobile phones, music players, cameras, calculators, ATMs, and televisions to name a few. We use electronics for communication, entertainment, manufacturing, to diagnose disease, to help us drive our cars, and for thousands of everyday activities.

[[File:Electronics workbench.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 2.13''': An electronics workbench.]]

Figure 14 shows an early television, manufactured in 1953. Radio and television are electronic devices that deserve special attention because of their impact on the way news and information are communicated. Prior to the development of these technologies, news and information traveled slowly, through written forms of communication. Today, the television allows people to view world events in real time. With its hundreds of channels, people can also experience other lands and cultures and be entertained.

[[File:Television_set_from_the_early_1950s crop.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 2.14''': A television that was manufactured in 1953.]]

Figure 15 shows an irrigation system for a large farm, and represents agricultural mechanization (the development of machines that help farmers produce crops). Prior to the development of farm equipment, farmers relied on animals to help them plow their fields. The planting, watering, and harvesting of crops was all done by hand. The amount of work required to produce crops limited the crops that individual farmers could grow. This also meant that many people were employed in farming and many families grew their own produce. Machines made it possible for a single farmer to produce larger quantities of crops, as well as a more consistent quality of crops. This, in turn, provided greater supplies of food for society, and reduced its cost.

[[File:PivotIrrigationOnCotton.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 2.15''': An irrigation system waters growing cotton plants.]]

Figure 16 shows an early computer. Computers change the way we communicate. Computers help us write; this chapter has been written, formatted, and distributed by computer. In engineering and science they perform complex computations; there are many problems, such as weather prediction, that require billions of computations. Without computers, we could not do these complex calculations. Computers are also used to control machines. Computers help guide and fly airplanes; they control the engine in your car. Computers can store vast amounts of information that is readily available, and they connect us to the world through the
Internet. Computers facilitate learning, and provide us with a great source of entertainment.

[[File:HP85B.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 2.16''': An HB85B computer, manufactured in the early 1980s.]]

Figure 17 shows a man drinking water through a filtration straw, and represents an example of healthcare technology. The specialized straw is capable of filtering harmful bacteria and parasites from polluted water supplies. In the past decades, there have been numerous healthcare technologies developed that have decreased '''mortality rates''', increased life spans, and contributed to a better quality of life. These technologies include advanced surgical techniques, artificial organs, instruments that can diagnose ailments, and preventive healthcare devices.

[[File:LifeStraw use.jpeg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 2.17''': The LifeStraw is a water purification device designed to filter bacteria out of water and is powered by suction. Water is passed through an iodine-coated bead chamber that kills bacteria and parasites. It costs around $3.75 and can last for a total of 700 liters of water.]]
[[File:Air conditioners on apartment walls.jpg|220px|thumb|'''Figure 2.18''': Walls of apartment buildings.]]

Figure 18 may be the most difficult to discern. The picture shows the side of a large building with air-conditioning units on many windows. Air-conditioning was originally developed to help cool manufacturing processes. In the mid-1900s, home air-conditioning was developed, fueling an explosive growth in Sunbelt cities such as Las Vegas, Houston, and Phoenix. Air-conditioning has changed our work environments, permitting us to work in greater comfort. It has also shifted the patterns of seasonal work and play.

The ten other great engineering accomplishments of the twentieth century identified by the NAE include highways, spacecraft, the Internet, imaging, household appliances, health technologies, petroleum and petrochemical technologies, laser and fiber optics, nuclear technologies, and high-performance materials.

Write a brief report about one of the great engineering achievements of the twentieth century from the list earlier in this chapter. Give some specific examples of how the achievement has changed the way that people live and explain why the achievement is important.

==The Impact of Engineering==
To understand the impact of engineering on society we can imagine how people lived 100 years ago before these technologies existed. For example, how did people communicate without telephones and the Internet? The primary method of long-distance communication was letters. While letters are a wonderful means of communication, they take time to write and even more time to be delivered. If the distance between sender and recipient was great, it may have taken months to deliver a letter via Pony Express (Figure 19).

[[File:Seal_of_the_United_States_Department_of_the_Post_Office.svg|400px|center|thumb|'''Figure 2.19''': Before the telegraph, telephone and automobile, messages were sent by horse-back. This figure shows the official seal of the Post Office Department, the predecessor of the United States Postal Service.]]

Advancements in communication have also helped change the way many companies work today. Remember the profile of Ashley, our first engineer? Ashley works at home managing two engineering teams from across the world. That would not have been possible with letters. Engineering solutions have continually improved the quality of life, added business value, and significantly influenced the '''global economy'''.

Engineering has both intended and unintended consequences. For example, air-conditioning makes comfortable life possible in much of southern United States. However, sometimes the unintended consequences of new technologies can be negative. About a decade ago, scientists discovered that Freon and similar gasses used in air conditioners were contributing to damage to the Earth's protective ozone layer. As a result, new gasses and technology had to be developed. Consider as well the impact on culture from air conditioners. Prior to air-conditioning, many people sat on their front porch in the evenings, in part because their
homes were too hot. Also, people often had very high ceilings—a design intended to help with home cooling.

Another example of unintended consequences is several years ago a company developed corn seeds that were highly resistant to weed killers and insects so that farmers would not need to spray poisons on their fields. An unintended consequence was that the new type of corn seed, after it had been growing for several years, started growing in fields where it had not been planted. Farmers tried to kill the unwanted corn plants but were unable to do it because the corn was resistant to the poisons.

==The Future of Engineering==
It is very difficult to predict the future of engineering, but engineers attempt this whenever they design new products. Engineers try to determine what people will want and need—both now and in the future—and then they design things to fulfill those wants and needs.

While we do not know exactly what will happen in the future, we can examine some possible scenarios. Consider natural catastrophes. There have been many significant catastrophes in the past decade including powerful hurricanes, earthquakes, and tsunamis that have killed hundreds of thousands of people and destroyed a great deal of property. If we go back further in the history of the world we also find that major volcanic eruptions and rare collisions with meteorites have impacted the entire planet. Engineers are working on ways to protect people and property from these disasters as well as ways to predict and respond rapidly to these types of disasters.

Another threat to people's well being comes from disease. Between 1300 and 1500, the bubonic plague killed between one-third and one-half of Europe's population. Later, cholera killed large numbers as well. Today, these diseases have been largely eradicated in the developed world through engineering of clean water and sanitation systems. However, the world currently faces an AIDS epidemic (Figure 20), and there are likely to be new disease threats in the future. Engineers will work with scientists, governments, and health workers to develop and implement technologies that will prevent and respond to these threats.

[[File:Africa HIV-AIDS.svg|400px|center|thumb|'''Figure 2.20''': Percentage of adults (ages 15-49) in Africa infected with the HIV/AIDS virus in 1999. Percentage of adults (ages 15–49) in Africa infected with the HIV/AIDS virus in 1999.  Grey countries had no data available.

Another certain need that will be met by engineering is energy. Because all people in the world need energy, the world production and use of energy is growing at a rapid pace. You might recall that both electrification and the automobile were listed as great engineering achievements of the twentieth century. Fossil fuels, the source of energy used most often to produce electricity and to power automobiles, also causes pollution and contributes to global warming. Also, supplies of fossil fuels are limited and becoming more expensive. Some wonder if the world can sustain the current energy growth and consumption patterns. With only a few countries owning the majority of energy resources, there is further concern about the supply of energy at prices that most people can afford. Engineers and scientists are working on developing new energy technologies for the future.

Some emerging trends in engineering are in the areas of biotechnology and nanotechnology. In the area of biotechnology, engineers are working on designs that impact the human body, animals, and plant life. Engineers and scientist are working on technologies to help the blind to see, the hearing impaired to hear, and the disabled to walk. Biotechnology has also opened the possibility of controversial areas such as cloning. Engineers are also working with scientist to develop crops and processes that can be used as fuels for energy.

Nanotechnology refers to the development of products and components that are very small, typically between 1 and 100 nanometers. A nanometer is 1{{e|−9}} meters. A nanometer is so small that it takes a very powerful microscope to see an object of that size. While the area of nanotechnology is very new, it shows promise to provide new technologies ranging from lighter and stronger materials to nanorobots that can repair individual cells to new treatments for cancer.

{{Robox|theme=14|title=Enrichment Activity (Long)}}
Envision the future by designing and drawing a picture of a new product. Explain what need or purpose the new design is fulfilling. Ask others to review your design and give you some feedback. Then use the feedback to redesign your product.

==Conclusion==
In this chapter we have explored the nature of engineering through the profiles of several practicing engineers, through engineering job advertisements, and through some of the great accomplishments of engineers. We have explored some of the very broad sets of engineering careers and tasks. We have also discussed the most common engineering specializations of today. These activities establish a foundation for understanding the impact of engineering on our society. We have also examined several trends to help us understand the future of engineering. And finally, we have explored the educational requirements and licensure of engineering.

[[File:Donnington Castle - UK - geograph.org.uk - 7002.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Remains of Castle Donnington]]

Donnington Castle is a ruined medieval castle, situated in the small village of Donnington, just north of the town of Newbury in Berkshire. It was built by its original owner, Richard Abberbury the Elder, under a licence granted by Richard II in 1386. The surviving castle gatehouse dates from this time. The castle was subsequently bought by Thomas Chaucer, the son of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer, as a residence for his daughter Alice, who later became Duchess of Suffolk. This family later fell out with the Tudor monarchs, and the castle became a Royal property. Both King Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I visited Donnington Castle, in 1539 and 1568 respectively.

The castle was originally built in a rectangular form, with a curtain wall cornered by four round towers, two square wall towers, and a substantial gatehouse, constructed around a courtyard. The courtyard buildings were probably of timber construction and possibly included a hall, kitchen, and guest lodgings.

By the time the English Civil War broke out in 1643, the castle was owned by the Parliamentarian John Packer family but after the First Battle of Newbury it was taken for the King, Charles I, and held by Sir John Boys. They quickly built defences on the slopes of the hill in a star shape. The projections were for gun emplacements, the scarps and platforms of which survive today. Despite being besieged for most of the war, it had to be relieved by the King on two occasions, the castle succeeded in guarding the major routes from London to the West Country and Oxford to Southampton. During the Second Battle of Newbury, the castle was able to hold off the Parliamentary attackers. Finally, after an eighteen month siege, the garrison, after obtaining the Kings permission, abandoned the damaged castle and were allowed to rejoin Royalist forces in Wallingford.

In 1646 Parliament voted to demolish the castle leaving only the gatehouse remaining, which was then restored to John Packer. All that remains of the castle today is the substantial four towered gatehouse, and the surrounding earthworks.

The castle is now in the care of English Heritage and is a scheduled ancient monument number 233041. The gatehouse is two stories high and roofed at battlement level. The external walls of the castle have been rebuilt to a height of 50 centimetres to indicate the original layout. The temporary Civil War works remain for the most part as scarps averaging 1.7m high.

Windsor Castle is a medieval castle  in Windsor, Berkshire. The original castle was built after the Norman invasion by William the Conqueror. Since the time of Henry I it has been used by a succession of monarchs and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe.

Originally designed to protect Norman dominance around the outskirts of London, and to oversee a strategically important part of the River Thames, Windsor Castle was built as a motte and bailey, with three wards surrounding a central mound. Gradually replaced with stone fortifications, the castle withstood a prolonged siege during the First Barons' War at the start of the 13th century. Henry III built a luxurious royal palace within the castle during the middle of the century.

Windsor Castle survived a tumultuous period during the English Civil War, in which the castle was used as a military headquarters for Parliamentary forces and a prison for Charles I. During the Restoration, Charles II rebuilt much of Windsor Castle with the help of architect Hugh May, creating a set of extravagant, Baroque interiors. After a period of neglect during the 18th century, George III and George IV renovated and rebuilt Charles II's palace at colossal expense.

Windsor Castle occupies a large site of more than thirteen acres and combines the features of a fortification, a palace, and a small town. It is in essence a Georgian and Victorian design based on a medieval structure, with Gothic features reinvented in a modern style. Since the 14th century, architecture at the castle has attempted to produce a contemporary reinterpretation of older fashions and traditions, repeatedly imitating outmoded or even antiquated styles.

This tutorial covers the rendering of virtual images of objects in '''plane mirrors'''. 

It is based on blending as described in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Transparency}} and requires some understanding of {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}.

===Virtual Images in Plane Mirrors===
The image we see in a plane mirror is called a “virtual image” because it is the same as the image of the real scene except that all positions are mirrored at the plane of the mirror; thus, we don't see the real scene but a “virtual” image of it. 

This transformation of a real object to a virtual object can be computed by transforming each position from world space into the local coordinate system of the mirror; negating the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; coordinate (assuming that the mirror plane is spanned by the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axes); and transforming the resulting position back to world space. This suggests a very straightforward approach to rendering virtual images of game objects by using another shader pass with a vertex shader that mirrors every vertex and normal vector, and a fragment shader that mirrors the position of light sources before computing the shading. (In fact, the light source at the original positions might also be taken into account because they represent light that is reflected by the mirror before reaching the real object.) There isn't anything wrong with this approach except that it is very limited: no other objects may be behind the mirror plane (not even partially) and the space behind the mirror plane must only be visible through the mirror. This is fine for mirrors on walls of a box that contains the whole scene if all the geometry outside the box can be removed. However, it doesn't work for mirrors with objects behind it (as in the painting by Velázquez) nor for semitransparent mirrors, for example glass windows.

===Placing the Virtual Objects===
It turns out that implementing a more general solution is not straightforward in the free version of Unity because neither rendering to textures (which would allow us to render the scene from a virtual camera position behind the mirror) nor stencil buffers (which would allow us to restrict the rendering to the region of the mirror) are available in the free version of Unity. 

I came up with the following solution: First, every game object that might appear in the mirror has to have a virtual “Doppelgänger”, i.e. a copy that follows all the movements of the real game object but with positions mirrored at the mirror plane. Each of these virtual objects needs a script that sets its position and orientation according to the corresponding real object and the mirror plane, which are specified by public variables:

&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
@script ExecuteInEditMode()
 
var objectBeforeMirror : GameObject;
var mirrorPlane : GameObject;
 
function Update () 
{
   if (null != mirrorPlane) 
   {
      renderer.sharedMaterial.SetMatrix(&quot;_WorldToMirror&quot;, 
         mirrorPlane.renderer.worldToLocalMatrix);
      if (null != objectBeforeMirror) 
      {
         transform.position = objectBeforeMirror.transform.position;
         transform.rotation = objectBeforeMirror.transform.rotation;
         transform.localScale = 
            -objectBeforeMirror.transform.localScale; 
         transform.RotateAround(objectBeforeMirror.transform.position, 
            mirrorPlane.transform.TransformDirection(
            Vector3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)), 180.0);

         var positionInMirrorSpace : Vector3 = 
            mirrorPlane.transform.InverseTransformPoint(
            objectBeforeMirror.transform.position);
         positionInMirrorSpace.y = -positionInMirrorSpace.y;
         transform.position = mirrorPlane.transform.TransformPoint(
            positionInMirrorSpace);
      }
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
The origin of the local coordinate system (&lt;code&gt;objectBeforeMirror.transform.position&lt;/code&gt;) is transformed as described above; i.e., it's transformed to the local coordinate system of the mirror with &lt;code&gt;mirrorPlane.transform.InverseTransformPoint()&lt;/code&gt;, then the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; coordinate is reflected, and then it is transformed back to world space with &lt;code&gt;mirrorPlane.transform.TransformPoint()&lt;/code&gt;. However, the orientation is a bit difficult to specify in JavaScript: we have to reflect all coordinates (&lt;code&gt;transform.localScale = -objectBeforeMirror.transform.localScale&lt;/code&gt;) and rotate the virtual object by 180° around the surface normal vector of the mirror (&lt;code&gt;Vector3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)&lt;/code&gt; transformed to world coordinates. This does the trick because a rotation around 180° corresponds to the reflection of two axes orthogonal to the rotation axis. Thus, this rotation undoes the previous reflection for two axes and we are left with the one reflection in the direction of the rotation axis, which was chosen to be the normal of the mirror. 

Of course, the virtual objects should always follow the real object, i.e. they shouldn't collide with other objects nor be influenced by physics in any other way. Using this script on all virtual objects is already sufficient for the case mentioned above: no real objects behind the mirror plane and no other way to see the space behind the mirror plane except through the mirror. In other cases we have to render the mirror in order to occlude the real objects behind it.

===Rendering the Mirror===
Now things become a bit tricky. Let's list what we want to achieve:
* Real objects behind the mirror should be occluded by the mirror.
* The mirror should be occluded by the virtual objects (which are actually behind it).
* Real objects in front of the mirror should occlude the mirror and any virtual objects.
* Virtual objects should only be visible in the mirror, not outside of it.
If we could restrict rendering to an arbitrary part of the screen (e.g. with a stencil buffer), this would be easy: render all geometry including an opaque mirror; then restrict the rendering to the visible parts of the mirror (i.e. not the parts that are occluded by other real objects); clear the depth buffer in these visible parts of the mirror; and render all virtual objects. It's straightforward if we had a stencil buffer.

Since we don't have a stencil buffer, we use the alpha component (a.k.a. opacity or A component) of the framebuffer as a substitute (similar to the technique used in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Translucent Bodies}}). In the first pass of the shader for the mirror, all pixels in the visible part of the mirror (i.e. the part that is not occluded by real objects in front of it) will be marked by an alpha component of 0, while pixels in the rest of the screen should have an alpha component of 1. The first problem is that we have to make sure that the rest of the screen has an alpha component of 1, i.e. all background shaders and object shaders should set alpha to 1. For example, Unity's skyboxes don't set alpha to 1; thus, we have to modify and replace all those shaders that don't set alpha to 1. Let's assume that we can do that. Then the first pass of the shader for the mirror is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
      // 1st pass: mark mirror with alpha = 0
      Pass { 
         GLSLPROGRAM
 
         #ifdef VERTEX
 
         void main()
         { 
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
 
         #endif
 
         #ifdef FRAGMENT
 
         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0); 
               // this color should never be visible, 
               // only alpha is important
         }
 
         #endif
 
         ENDGLSL
      }
&lt;/source&gt;

How does this help us to limit the rendering to the pixels with alpha equal to 0? It doesn't. However, it does help us to restrict any changes of colors in the framebuffer by using a clever blend equation (see {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Transparency}}):

&lt;code&gt;Blend OneMinusDstAlpha DstAlpha&lt;/code&gt;

We can think of the blend equation as:

&lt;code&gt;vec4 result = vec4(1.0 - pixel_color.a) * gl_FragColor + vec4(pixel_color.a) * pixel_color;&lt;/code&gt;

where &lt;code&gt;pixel_color&lt;/code&gt; is the color of a pixel in the framebuffer. Let's see what the expression is for &lt;code&gt;pixel_color.a&lt;/code&gt; equal to 1 (i.e. outside of the visible part of the mirror):

&lt;code&gt;vec4(1.0 - 1.0) * gl_FragColor + vec4(1.0) * pixel_color == pixel_color&lt;/code&gt; 

Thus, if &lt;code&gt;pixel_color.a&lt;/code&gt; is equal to 1, the blending equation makes sure that we don't change the pixel color in the framebuffer. What happens if &lt;code&gt;pixel_color.a&lt;/code&gt; is equal to 0 (i.e. inside the visible part of the mirror)?

&lt;code&gt;vec4(1.0 - 0.0) * gl_FragColor + vec4(0.0) * pixel_color == gl_FragColor&lt;/code&gt; 

In this case, the pixel color of the framebuffer will be set to the fragment color that was set in the fragment shader. Thus, using this blend equation, our fragment shader will only change the color of pixels with an alpha component of 0. Note that the alpha component in &lt;code&gt;gl_FragColor&lt;/code&gt; should also be 0 such that the pixels are still marked as part of the visible region of the mirror.

That was the first pass. The second pass has to clear the depth buffer before we start to render the virtual objects such that we can use the normal depth test to compute occlusions (see {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Per-Fragment Operations}}). Actually, it doesn't matter whether we clear the depth buffer only for the pixels in the visible part of the mirror or for all pixels of the screen because we won't change the colors of any pixels with alpha equal to 1 anyways. In fact, this is very fortunate because (without stencil test) we cannot limit the clearing of the depth buffer to the visible part of the mirror. Instead, we clear the depth buffer for the whole mirror by transforming the vertices to the far clipping plane, i.e. the maximum depth. 

As explained in {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Vertex Transformations}}, the output of the vertex shader in &lt;code&gt;gl_Position&lt;/code&gt; is divided automatically by the fourth coordinate &lt;code&gt;gl_Position.w&lt;/code&gt; to compute normalized device coordinates between -1 and +1. In fact, a &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; coordinate of +1 represents the maximum depth; thus, this is what we are aiming for. However, because of that automatic (perspective) division by &lt;code&gt;gl_Position.w&lt;/code&gt;, we have to set &lt;code&gt;gl_Position.z&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;gl_Position.w&lt;/code&gt; in order to get a normalized device coordinate of +1. Here is the second pass of the mirror shader:

&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
      // 2nd pass: set depth to far plane such that 
      // we can use the normal depth test for the reflected geometry
      Pass { 
         ZTest Always
         Blend OneMinusDstAlpha DstAlpha
 
         GLSLPROGRAM
 
         uniform vec4 _Color; 
            // user-specified background color in the mirror
 
         #ifdef VERTEX
 
         void main()
         {                                         
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
            gl_Position.z = gl_Position.w;
               // the perspective division will divide gl_Position.z 
               // by gl_Position.w; thus, the depth is 1.0, 
               // which represents the far clipping plane
         }
 
         #endif
 
         #ifdef FRAGMENT
 
         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = vec4(_Color.rgb, 0.0); 
               // set alpha to 0.0 and 
               // the color to the user-specified background color
         }
 
         #endif
 
         ENDGLSL
      }
&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;ZTest&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;Always&lt;/code&gt; in order to deactivate it. This is necessary because our vertices are actually behind the mirror (in order to reset the depth buffer); thus, the fragments would fail a normal depth test. We use the blend equation which was discussed above to set the user-specified background color of the mirror. (If there is a skybox in your scene, you would have to compute the mirrored view direction and look up the environment map here; see {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Skyboxes}}.)

This is the shader for the mirror. Here is the complete shader code, which uses &lt;code&gt;&quot;Transparent+10&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to make sure that it is rendered after all real objects (including transparent objects) have been rendered:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
Shader &quot;GLSL shader for mirrors&quot; {
   Properties {
      _Color (&quot;Mirrors's Color&quot;, Color) = (1, 1, 1, 1) 
   } 
   SubShader {
      Tags { &quot;Queue&quot; = &quot;Transparent+10&quot; } 
         // draw after all other geometry has been drawn 
         // because we mess with the depth buffer
      
      // 1st pass: mark mirror with alpha = 0
      Pass { 
         GLSLPROGRAM
 
         #ifdef VERTEX
 
         void main()
         { 
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
 
         #endif
 
         #ifdef FRAGMENT
 
         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0); 
               // this color should never be visible, 
               // only alpha is important
         }
 
         #endif
 
         ENDGLSL
      }

      // 2nd pass: set depth to far plane such that 
      // we can use the normal depth test for the reflected geometry
      Pass { 
         ZTest Always
         Blend OneMinusDstAlpha DstAlpha
 
         GLSLPROGRAM
 
         uniform vec4 _Color; 
            // user-specified background color in the mirror
 
         #ifdef VERTEX
 
         void main()
         {                                         
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
            gl_Position.z = gl_Position.w;
               // the perspective division will divide gl_Position.z 
               // by gl_Position.w; thus, the depth is 1.0, 
               // which represents the far clipping plane
         }
 
         #endif
 
         #ifdef FRAGMENT
 
         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = vec4(_Color.rgb, 0.0); 
               // set alpha to 0.0 and 
               // the color to the user-specified background color
         }
 
         #endif
 
         ENDGLSL
      }
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Rendering the Virtual Objects===
Once we have cleared the depth buffer and marked the visible part of the mirror by setting the alpha component to 0, we can use the blend equation
 
&lt;code&gt;Blend OneMinusDstAlpha DstAlpha&lt;/code&gt;

to render the virtual objects. Can't we? There is another situation in which we shouldn't render virtual objects and that's when they come out of the mirror! This can actually happen when real objects move into the reflecting surface. Water lilies and swimming objects are examples. We can avoid the rasterization of fragments of virtual objects that are outside the mirror by discarding them with the &lt;code&gt;discard&lt;/code&gt; instruction (see {{GLSL Programming Unity SectionRef|Cutaways}}) if their &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; coordinate in the local coordinate system of the mirror is positive. To this end, the vertex shader has to compute the vertex position in the local coordinate system of the mirror and therefore the shader requires the corresponding transformation matrix, which we have fortunately set in the script above. The complete shader code for the virtual objects is then:

&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
Shader &quot;GLSL shader for virtual objects in mirrors&quot; {
   Properties {
      _Color (&quot;Virtual Object's Color&quot;, Color) = (1, 1, 1, 1) 
   } 
   SubShader {
      Tags { &quot;Queue&quot; = &quot;Transparent+20&quot; } 
         // render after mirror has been rendered
      
      Pass { 
         Blend OneMinusDstAlpha DstAlpha 
            // when the framebuffer has alpha = 1, keep its color
            // only write color where the framebuffer has alpha = 0

         GLSLPROGRAM
 
         // User-specified uniforms
         uniform vec4 _Color;
         uniform mat4 _WorldToMirror; // set by a script
 
         // The following built-in uniforms  
         // are also defined in &quot;UnityCG.glslinc&quot;, 
         // i.e. one could #include &quot;UnityCG.glslinc&quot; 
         uniform mat4 _Object2World; // model matrix
 
         // Varying
         varying vec4 positionInMirror;
 
         #ifdef VERTEX
 
         void main()
         { 
            positionInMirror = 
               _WorldToMirror * (_Object2World * gl_Vertex);
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;;
         }
 
         #endif
 
         #ifdef FRAGMENT
 
         void main()
         {
            if (positionInMirror.y &gt; 0.0) 
               // reflection comes out of mirror?
            {
               discard; // don't rasterize it
            }
            gl_FragColor = vec4(_Color.rgb, 0.0); // set alpha to 0.0 
         }
 
         #endif
 
         ENDGLSL
      }
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that the line 

&lt;code&gt;     Tags { &quot;Queue&quot; = &quot;Transparent+20&quot; } &lt;/code&gt;

makes sure that the virtual objects are rendered after the mirror, which uses &lt;code&gt;&quot;Transparent+10&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. In this shader, the virtual objects are rasterized with a uniform, user-specified color in order to keep the shader as short as possible. In a complete solution, the shader would compute the lighting and texturing with the mirrored normal vector and mirrored positions of light sources. However, this is straightforward and very much dependent on the particular shaders that are employed for the real objects.

===Limitations===
There are several limitations of this approach which we haven't addressed. For example:
* multiple mirror planes (virtual objects of one mirror might appear in another mirror)
* multiple reflections in mirrors
* semitransparent virtual objects
* semitransparent mirrors
* reflection of light in mirrors 
* uneven mirrors (e.g. with a normal map)
* uneven mirrors in the free version of Unity 
* etc.

===Summary===
Congratulations! Well done. Two of the things we have looked at:
*How to render mirrors with a stencil buffer.
*How to render mirrors without a stencil buffer.

===Further Reading===
If you still want to know more
*about using the stencil buffer to render mirrors, you could read Section 9.3.1 of the SIGGRAPH '98 Course “Advanced Graphics Programming Techniques Using OpenGL” organized by Tom McReynolds, which is available [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.165.9026&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf online].

== Volunteers? ==

Hi guys,
I just was wondering whether it would be ok if I posted a thread on Blender Artists asking for volunteers?
Any thoughts?

--[[User:JamesNZ|JamesNZ]] ([[User talk:JamesNZ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesNZ|contribs]]) 08:36, 15 July 2011 (UTC)

: I think you do not need to ask permission from Wikibooks to do that. I think you may, depending on where, want to ask their permission beforehand as some places may take it as spam or advertising which might not be appreciated. I think when people are massed invited, there is a tendency by the invited people to overlook project policies. I suggest you find some way to mention some of the more important points, like any text is CC-BY-SA and GFDL licensed, images can use any copyleft license and need to specify which, and the need to explain things rather than simply linking to where information is already available elsewhere on the web. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:04, 15 July 2011 (UTC)

Thanks Darklama, I'll do that.--[[User:JamesNZ|JamesNZ]] ([[User talk:JamesNZ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesNZ|contribs]]) 01:26, 16 July 2011 (UTC)
== Discontinue [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance]]? ==

I propose that [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance]] be discontinued. I think there is some overlap and confusion with [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General]], [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Proposals]] and [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Projects]] that could be reduced by its discontinuation. Additionally there appears to be few and infrequent discussions there of late, so its discontinuation might help to refocus the other discussions as well. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:46, 17 July 2011 (UTC)

:My understanding was that the last change was to address the times of high activity that made some of the old monolithically pages difficult and some of the &quot;new&quot; additions to the nav. guides have been only a promotion of visibility of old existing pages.
:My view is that the way people have been using [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Proposals]] has been sometimes abusive of its function, this allied  with the lack of the necessary participation and the seemingly disregard for any structured proceeding to validate or refute proposals makes this page [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Proposals]] the one that is in need of a reformulation as to serve its initial purpose. I also have the idea that some of the past proposals noncontroversial (no expressed opposition) sometimes have lacked the necessary administrative action before being automatically archived.
:[[Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance]] has been historically the optimum location to most of the &quot;assistance&quot; requests (if any change is done remember to merge the history page is active since July 2007), I don't have a specific preference to any of the old and recent reformat or even your proposal beyond the considerations I'm making here, but it seem the naming of the page is more indicative of its function for instance [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Projects]] seems redundant and lacking in activity, post that fit there should also fit in a general request for assistance or be placed in [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General]] discussion area. Another idea is the merge of the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Technical Assistance]] and [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance]] assistance pages the only distinction on most of those pages posts is the level of complexity of problems not exclusively of a technical nature and most would probably even benefit from being posted on the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General]] when not Wikimedia related, but overall it seems to be the discussion area that works best.
:I have a particular dislike of the [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Nominations]] page and the general concept behind it for many reasons but I understand some of the valid reasons to have it and that some Wikibookians like the activity, a good ideas could be a rename like New Projects and Featured books (the core benefits of joining both communities would lead to the extension of function, information, normalization and what people prefer).
:In any case I'm against the disappearance of the general assistance discussion page. In fact keeping moving things around (or defining new nav. aides) only aggravates the problem of people not posting in the correct area, a more active hands on approach on correcting people out would probably result, over time, in a greater compliance than renames and reshuffles that ultimately can't make anyone entirely happy, resulting in everlasting pushes for similar alterations.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 17:57, 17 July 2011 (UTC)

: I think for general discussion areas, stability is worth a very great deal, and we would need a really compelling reason to change things.  I don't see anything atm rising at all near the requisite level of compulsion.  (If, btw, we ever do change things around, I think it's important to use page moves to guarantee that anyone who has the current pages on their watchlist ends up with the corresponding new pages on their watchlist.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 21:37, 17 July 2011 (UTC)

:I certainly won't be implementing any changes, after the nightmare following the renaming of [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Feature requests]] to [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Proposals]]. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:34, 18 July 2011 (UTC)

I guess I should clarify. I am not proposing to merge anything. By discontinue I am suggesting that links to the Assistance page be removed from the navigation and reading room main page. People would be able to continue to search the archives using the search box located at the reading room's main page. Current discussions in the Assistance could either be archived in the Assistance Archive, or copied to another of the reading room discussions to be archived later. In either case, the Assistance page would be turned into a redirect with its history left as is. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:15, 18 July 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOINDEX__

This is an ''experimental page'' not approved by official OpenSCAD. It is also unfinished. 

== How OpenSCAD works ==

OpenSCAD, takes text commands, like '''cube(1)''', and creates mathematical representations of those objects. Those math models can then be used by other systems, like skeinforge &amp; a 3d printer. 

The process by which this happens can be broken down into several steps.

== Parsing the script into an Abstract Syntax Tree ==

OpenSCAD uses a 'lexer' and a 'parser' to scan the script text. To process this, it uses the old free software tools, bison and yacc. What does the parsing do? It takes commands like 'cube(5)' and transorms them into a 'tree' of 'nodes' of abstract descriptions.

You can see the result in Openscad by clicking 'Design/AST Tree'

== CSG compiling and rendering ==

The Abstract Syntax Tree is then formed into a tree of Computational Solid Geometry (or CSG) objects.  
You can view the result of this CSG tree in Openscad by clicking on Design/CSG-Tree

How does it work? Beginning with the ''root node'' of the AST tree, this function is called:

 AbstractNode.render_csg_term

Then, the same function is called on all the children of the node. This proceeds recursively until the entire tree of nodes has been 'walked'. 

If the node has polygons, like a 'primitive' node such as a cube or sphere, then those polygons are created. It is called 'PolySet' rendering. Here is some '''pseudocode''':

 AbstractPolyNode.render_csg_term
   polyset = PrimitiveNode.render_polyset()
   AbstractPolyNode.render_csg_term_from_ps( polyset )
     c = CSGTerm( polyset )

== CSG Normalization ==

CSG gets normalized. The code says the following:

        // This function implements the CSG normalization
        // Reference: Florian Kirsch, Juergen Doeller,
        // OpenCSG: A Library for Image-Based CSG Rendering,
        // University of Potsdam, Hasso-Plattner-Institute, Germany
        // http://www.opencsg.org/data/csg_freenix2005_paper.pdf

== Node.m and transformations ==

What about transformations, like scale(), rotate(), and translate()? They are represented in a 'homogenous' matrix that is associated with each node. The matrix is called, simply, '''m'''. 

The actual scaling, rotation, and translation are done differently depending on how the objects are rendered. In the ThrownTogether and OpenCSG renderers, these transformations are actually done by the OpenGL system with calls to the [http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glMultMatrix.xml glMultMatrix()] function. IE. if you have a scale(4) cube(1), OpenSCAD will create polygons of a cube with sides 1 unit in length, then feed a scaling-matrix to OpenGL, which does the actual multiplication. 

If the rendering is for 3d objects using CGAL, then OpenSCAD calls the CGAL &quot;Affine Transformation&quot; functions. 

You can actually see this process at work by clicking on Design/CSG-Tree in OpenSCAD - every scale(), rotate(), etc, turns into a 'multmatrix' within the CSG tree. 

Further explanations are here:

== Rendering ==

After everything is compiled, it gets 'rendered' into a picture, or, if desired, a 3d-file for use with a 3d printer. There are actually three different rendering 'engines' that OpenSCAD can use to accomplish this task. Here is a list of the engines:

=== 2d output to screen ===

'''ThrownTogether''' - This is the most basic rendering engine. It produces 2d pictures on computers that do not have newer types of video cards &amp; drivers. (Specifically, OpenGL 2.0).

'''OpenCSG''' - This rendering engine comes from the opencsg project, at http://www.opencsg.org . This engine uses various tricks of the OpenGL graphics system to draw Computational Solid Geometry objects in a relatively speedy manner. It doesn't actually compute the various intersections and differences between objects, so it can't be used to make 3d-objects but it is good for fast 2d-rendering that OpenSCAD needs for its viewing window. 

Both of these engines use the OpenGL system for final output. OpenGL was created at the Silicon Graphics company to make it easier to write programs to draw 3d triangles on computer screens.

=== 3d output to a file ===

'''CGAL''' - the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library takes the abstract CSG objects and makes new 3d objects. For example, if you tell it you have a sphere and a cube intersecting, it will tell you the resulting poitns in space where those objects intersect, and various other information that you can use to create a 3d object that accurately represents the results of your commands. 

How does CGAL work? It uses a special form of geometrical mathematics that doesn't use floating point arithmetic, in order to avoid rounding errors. It calculates the intersections, unions, &amp; so forth of the various primitive objects, and gives back new objects, describing the new points and surfaces that describe them.

OpenSCAD then takes the CGAL output and transforms it into an STL file. STL is short for Stereo Lithography, which is the name of one of the first types of 3d printing technology. STL can the be transformed into '''gcode''' using a tool like '''Skeinforge'''. '''gcode''' is then fed into a 3d printer, like a MakerBot, and out comes a physical object.</text>

Engineering is a human endeavor. Humans have engaged in engineering to meet their needs as long as they have had needs. We invent and innovate when we are confronted with problems, needs, and desires. Inventions exist and continue to be created to meet our needs for daily life, such as access to water, energy, transportation, and entertainment. Petroski (2004) said, &quot;Making things is an activity as old as civilization, and making ever new things is part of being human&quot;. Our lives are permeated with technological inventions that humans have engineered (Figure 1). Yet, the fundamental nature of engineering or what engineers do is not everyday knowledge. For instance, many of us are unfamiliar with the basic principles used to build the systems that deliver water, gas, or electricity to our homes.

[[File:All Gizah Pyramids-2.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 3.1''': The ancient pyramids are an engineering marvel. The great pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for almost four thousand years.]]

Engineering is the design, analysis, and creation of things that are practical and useful in our lives. At its core, engineering incorporates design. Design, simply put, is creating something that has not existed before. Engineers help design, create or change almost everything we encounter in our lives, including what we feel, eat, see, and hear.

In this section, we consider several different engineering achievements that have dramatically changed the way we live today. We then consider the impact of engineering on sustainability of natural resources, and focus briefly on one very important resource: water.

==Human Needs Are Met By Engineering==
To stay alive, humans and animals need only the basics of water, food, and shelter. In addition to these basics, animals, and at times humans, too, need protection from other animals that are predators. For the most part, however, humans today do not have to worry about becoming food for other animals. Although we need water, food, clothes, and shelter, not very many of us fetch water from a well or a river; grow or kill our own food; make our own fabric and sew clothes; or, build our own homes with our own hands. We do not do this on our own because people have invented products, tools and systems to do it for us, allowing us to spend productive time in other ways.

We prefer to do something other than figure out how to get clean water to our homes, grow crops, raise poultry, make fabric and sew clothes, or construct homes. This is possible because of all the people before us who created inventions that met their and our needs. These inventions range from the basic technology of the plow or the wheel to today's advanced technologies that allow us to manage and sustain our natural resources or engage in space exploration. Human needs and wants have been met throughout time by engineering achievements that have significantly transformed and impacted our lives, especially over the past one hundred years.

The National Academy of Engineering (NAE) has identified the top twenty engineering achievements of the twentieth century; these achievements are documented in the book by Constable and Somerville (2003) and on the webpage (http://www.greatachievements. org/). These achievements are described in more detail in the section [[../Global and Societal Impact of Engineering/]]. These achievements include many of the technologies that we use every day and may take for granted.

One of these achievements that we will consider in more detail in this chapter is water supply and distribution. Water is vital for our lives. When we turn on our kitchen faucet and clean drinking water flows from the faucet, we seldom pause to think how that water got there (Figure 2). However, delivering clean water to your home or school or office requires an advanced system of treatment and distribution facilities. Imagine your life without indoor plumbing. Yet, even in today's world, there are many who live without access to running water, toilets, bathtubs, or showers. Maintaining water quality and distributing water to people where they live are timeless challenges. It is important to remember that water is not merely needed for our basic survival; in today's world water is used for many other purposes
that sustain our way of life.

[[File:Drinking fountain.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 3.2''': Most people in the United States are fortunate to have safe drinking water.]]

==Engineering Sustainability for Our Future==
Current projections predict that the earth's human population will be around 9 billion in 2050. By the year 3000 the world's population is predicted to be double that of today's 6.6 billion. Most of this expected increase is predicted to be concentrated in the developing nations of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Meeting the most basic needs of this future population means an ever-growing stress on our environment and limited natural resources. This means increased production and consumption of goods and services and increased demand for land, energy, and materials (NRC, 1999). While the engineering achievements of the past century have increased the standard of living in developed countries, the challenge of the future is to alleviate poverty and raise the standard of living for all on this planet while also sustaining our natural resources.

As we consider the engineering achievements of the past, we also need to consider their unintended consequences on our lives and our planet. We must ask ourselves: What are the social, economic, and environmental impacts of our engineering achievements? Many engineering decisions cannot be made without consideration of nearby natural and man-made systems, because contemporary engineering systems can affect the environment far into the future. There is a strong need to reduce the risk and level of unwanted disturbances to natural resources and our man-made world associated with engineering systems.

According to the National Resource Council (NRC, 1999): &quot;Sustainable development—the reconciliation of society’s developmental goals with its environmental limits over the long term—is the most recent conceptual focus linking the collective aspirations of the world's peoples for peace, freedom, improved living conditions, and a healthy environment&quot;. Engineers have an obligation to meet the basic needs of all humans for water, nutrition, energy, sanitation, and health, as well as the protection of the planet's resources, including our cultural and natural diversity.

==Water==
The next section focuses on one of the basic human needs: water. Water is a common substance. Its chemical formula of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is widely known. It is a life-giving natural resource. Seventy-one percent of the earth's surface is covered in water, most of which is salt water (Figure 3). Water is essential to most organisms on Earth. For instance, 50 – 70% of a human body is made up of water.

[[File:Earth.galileo.jpg|400px|center|thumb|'''Figure 3.3''': Water covers 71% of the Earth’s surface. This photograph of Earth's polar ice and oceans was taken by the Galileo space probe.]]

Water is one of the few substances on the planet Earth that can be found occurring naturally in all three states: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapor). A significant difference between these states is the density of each state. (Density here refers to how close the water molecules are to each other. The mass of water within a specific volume determines the density of water.) The vapor state is least dense, while the liquid state is most dense; the solid-state (ice) is less dense than the liquid state. Warm water is less dense than cold water. Therefore, heating and cooling water affects its density.

Water is a very good solvent for many compounds. Therefore, almost no pure water exists in nature; most water contains dissolved substances. After water falls to earth in the form of '''precipitation''', it dissolves substances from soil and rocks. This leads, for example, to hard water, which is water that has magnesium and calcium dissolved in it. Next time you buy bottled water, read the label. You may discover, to your surprise, that your pure spring water is not merely ''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O'', but also contains chemicals. In fact, the label on your bottled water may even list the chemicals and their amounts. Most water you drink has ions in it. Those ions in the water make it acidic or basic. The ''pH'' of water is a measure of its acidity or alkalinity; The ''pH'' index is related to the amount of free hydrogen ions in the water.

Water is a natural resource and sustaining it for future populations is a major challenge that will require creative engineering. Water is used by industry, agriculture, and homes. In many places in North America, people have access to all of the clean water they need. However, there are many places in the world where water supply is limited. Most uses of water actually decrease the quality of the water; this is true of water that is used in many industrial processes as well as water used by humans.

Our family, our community, our culture, our geographical area, and the prevailing economy often influence our values regarding water. For instance, if you are from an agricultural area, where your livelihood depends on the availability of water for your agricultural needs, you may rate the value or significance of water for your own life higher than someone whose livelihood is built around an entertainment industry such as running a cinema multiplex.

{{Robox|theme=8|title=Activity}}
Take a few minutes to consider the various uses for water you have encountered in your life. Get out a pen and paper and list as many uses for water as you can. Compare your list to someone else’s list. How are they different? What do they have in common?

Do you ever wonder how diseases spread? Water serves as a carrier or transmitter of many diseases. In fact, many of the world's diseases are dependent on water for their transmission. These diseases often occur in large epidemics and can be quite catastrophic. A large part of water engineering is maintaining water quality so the water that we receive when we turn on our kitchen faucets is potable. In addition to making water safe for drinking, water engineering is also about transporting water from its source into our homes and to the areas where we live.

In this section we will investigate cholera, a waterborne disease; we will learn about the scientific problem solving that verified that cholera was transmitted by water. We will then begin to investigate how engineers help society manage our water supply. This topic will be expanded in later sections.

==Background Information: Cholera==
Cholera is an acute intestinal infection caused by ingestion of contaminated water or food. The infection is caused by the Vibrio cholerae bacterium (Figure 4). This bacterium typically travels through water that is contaminated by human or animal feces. Human beings can contract cholera by ingesting water or food contaminated by the V. cholerae bacterium. Symptoms of cholera include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and dehydration. As the human body does not produce lasting immunity against the cholera bacterium, it is possible that the disease can be contracted more than once. When people die from cholera, it is generally due to severe dehydration caused by the illness. When left untreated cholera generally has a high mortality rate. A cholera outbreak can be widespread, causing a large scale epidemic in which hundreds or thousands of people die.

[[File:Cholera bacteria SEM.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 3.4''': Microscopic view of cholera bacteria.]]

{{Robox|theme=8|title=Activity}}
Research and review resources on cholera epidemics on the World Wide Web. Refer to encyclopedias from your school library or local library. Prepare a short list of answers that do no exceed 200–300 words for each of the following questions. You might use some of these suggested phrases for searching on the Internet: cholera, epidemics, cholera and water, water-borne diseases, water contamination sources, water quality, water purification.

* What were some of the major cholera epidemics of the past?
* What are some of the major cholera epidemics of the present?
* Where and under what conditions did the cholera epidemics occur?
* What role did water play in these cholera epidemics?
* How can the quality of water be maintained so the water does not get contaminated from bacteria such as the cholera bacterium?

==The 1854 Case of Cholera in London==
In 1854, hundreds of people living in London died during a cholera epidemic. At that time, very little was known about how the disease was transmitted. Many believed that people could contract diseases such as cholera by breathing bad or foul air. It is estimated that 616 people died during this epidemic. If not for the intervention of Dr. John Snow (b. 1813–d. 1858), who carefully mapped the number of deaths that occurred around water sources, primarily the Broad Street pump, and then worked with other officials to remove its handle, the cholera epidemic of 1854 in London would have been more widespread. It was later discovered that sewage was contaminating the water source for the Broad Street pump. Preventing people from using this pump stopped the use of water from that source. This action has been credited with greatly reducing the number of deaths during this epidemic.

Dr. Snow created the map in Figure 5. The Snow map depicted the area around the Broad Street pump where the number of deaths is indicated by dark blocks at the homes and establishments around the pump.

[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 3.5''': Number of deaths at 40 Broad Street. Deaths at homes are indicated by dark lines.]]

During an earlier cholera epidemic in London in 1848 and 1849, Snow had proposed the unusual idea that cholera was caused by something that was ingested orally, rather than by inhaling foul air. During the cholera epidemic of 1854 in London, Snow collected data by carefully interviewing people around Broad Street who had not been infected by the water they had been drinking. Others would cite, after Snow's death in 1858, that the data he had collected supporting his theory that cholera was primarily spread by sewage-contaminated water. Dr. Snow's research into the spread of cholera locally around the Broad Street pump is an important lesson taught even today to epidemiology students as a model of scientific reasoning. Dr. Snow authored a report about the cholera outbreak in the Parish of St. James, Westminster, during the Autumn of 1854; this as well as his other works are available online at the John Snow Archive and Research Companion website.

Today most of us know that unclean water carries bacteria that cause disease. We value clean water. However, in the 1800s, the idea that water could carry disease was frightening to many. During that time many people believed that catastrophic diseases such as cholera were visitation of retribution for sinful living of the poor. Dr. Snow had to work hard to convince the local authorities to remove the handle of the Broad Street pump. Now, people know that cholera infection can be avoided by drinking clean water. During the twentieth century, in the western hemisphere, incidences of cholera in the recent past are almost nonexistent. However, it is estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) that in developing nations only 35% of the population have access to clean water.

According to the WHO, the current response to cholera outbreaks tends to mostly in the form of emergency response whenever there is an outbreak. While emergency response is very important and prevents many deaths, it does not help prevent causes of cholera. Therefore, one cannot emphasize enough the importance of long-term cholera prevention. Key to the prevention of cholera and other waterborne diseases is closely related to the prevention of water contamination and water purification. Separating sewage water from natural water sources, treatment of sewage water, treatment of water resources, and purification of water for storage and delivery for human consumption are key elements of such a strategy that involve engineering solutions. In addition, medical research, personal hygiene, and public health education will play a key role in the prevention of cholera epidemics.

==Water Engineering and Management==
[[File:Water Tower in Mississauga.jpg|250px|thumb|'''Figure 3.6''': Water towers such as this one help distribute clean water to surrounding communities.]]

One of our significant challenges today is to obtain water for people and for food production, look after critical ecosystems and habitats, and deal with the variability and uncertainty of water on our earth. Water engineers and managers need to understand the complexity of water use and water resources management. Water for human consumption includes engineering solutions related to water supply and sanitation; management of water treatment and distribution systems (Figure 6); storm water, domestic wastewater, and urban drainage; and sustainable management of water for urban and rural areas. Water for food production
includes the use of water for agricultural purposes which necessitates engineering solutions related to planning, design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of irrigation and drainage projects. Water for energy production includes the use of engineering solutions such as dams for hydroelectric power. Water management is also related to engineering solutions for uncertain events such as flooding caused by natural and human activities.

==Writing a fact sheet tutorial==

A fact sheet is typically an important, at-a-glance tool used in public relations to provide an overview of a large issue.  Fact sheets can stand alone, but commonly supplement a news release, a chapter of a book, or replace a brochure. The point of a fact sheet is to get the reader to do something. More information than you need to convince them is a waste of the reader's time and risks losing their attention. Make it as easy as possible for them to take action.

===Fact sheet elements===

A fact sheet is generally one or two pages and includes “the who, what, when, where,  why and how” about a chapter or event. Here are some tips on creating a fact sheet.
::* One page is best 
::* Make it readable 
::* Keep the text brief - no one wants to read tons of information in a small font 
::* Keep the most important information in the first paragraph - what the issue is, what action is needed, and label the main message(s) 
::* Give references for more information - in electronic communications you can offer links 
::* The fact sheet must be self-contained - do not refer to previous documents or assume that the reader remembers the information 
::* Use bullets when you can 
::* Leave lots of white space 
::* Make it very clear what you want the reader to do - bold type face, text boxes, and graphics add emphasis 
::* Give the reader all the tools he/she may need to take action

===Tutorial Steps===

# In groups of two discuss potential options for a fact sheet topic.
# Find a majority view on what type of information would be useful for this fact sheet.
# Determine what related information would be too much or not suitable to the fact sheet.
# Discuss ideas on what visual aids could assist in the fact sheet.
# Discuss what kinds of information people may want to know more about, but for which you don't have enough space on the fact sheet. How can you point the reader towards this further information?

Note that some of these points discussed above relate to style. For the purposes of this exercise, we ask you to only sytlise within the wiki (which is quite limited).


Here are some examples of health related fact sheets
:*[http://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/docs/ExerciseandDepression.pdf Black Dog Institute - Exercise and Depression (PDF).] Note that the topic is broad and consequently too long for this assessment item, but the coverage in the sections is a good start.
:*[http://www.sads.org/images/stories/pdf/Exercise.pdf Sudden Death and exercise (PDF)] is a one page SADS fact sheet, but I don’t think it covers the sections outline above and appears to only make recommendations without a background.
:*[http://sma.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Diabetes-and-exercise-fact-sheetFINAL2010.pdf Sports Medicine Australia, diabetes and exercise fact sheet (PDF).] Similar to the depression fact sheet above, this covers sections well but is too broad in its approach for this assessment.
:*[http://www.bhfactive.org.uk/userfiles/Documents/factsheetchildren.pdf British Health Service, exercise recommendations for children (PDF).] covers 
recommendations very well.

==Technical Wiki Support==

Mediawiki - is software that allows many commonly used online wikis to work. Different programs work in slightly different ways, learning how mediawiki works will enable you to work on many different websites and is recognised as a format which will allow you to work  in other formats with ease. Common mediawiki sites include: Wikipedia, Wikiversity and WikiBooks. You will use Wikibooks for your assignment.&lt;/br&gt;

Objective
* To get you familiar, comfortable and experimenting with the technical skills of a media wiki.

===Register for account===

::* Go to wikibooks.org and register for an account (top right of screen). You may choose to log-in with an existing log-in if you already have one). Wikibooks has a help section for [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Using_Wikibooks/Setting_Up_A_User_Account setting up a user account ]

====Notes on usernames====

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTzUwXaAK2s Video: Wikimedia foundation - Username]

Think carefully about your username. There are both potential negatives and positives to using a username that can be linked to your person. Do you want (or not want) to be linked to the work you are doing? Particularly poor or offensive work may not help you in the future, but good work can help. You can’t change the username associated with work written in the past.

Email your name and username (once registration completed) to the unit convenor.

===Edit your profile===

Once completed click on your username (the link will be red - red denotes that there is no content behind that link). You are now in a space which relates to your username profile, it is here we will practice editing a mediawiki before moving on to your fact sheet.

::* Click edit

Here we have set a number of tasks to help you get used to working in the wiki.

Resources to get you started
:*Wikibooks help section on [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:How_to_edit_a_page how to edit a page]
:* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7yXx3YbcNI Youtube - Howcast - how to: quick overview of wikipedia editing]

# Introduce yourself - write a couple of sentences about yourself. Click save and view it.
# Click back on the edit button, and create the following section headings:
:# Background
:# Interests
:# Wikibooks projects
# Save and make sure you have subheadings present.
# Click on edit and add information to each section. - add the Exercise in Disease site to your profile, you will add detail of your particular fact sheet once it has started
# In the top section, add an image of yourself.

===History===

Now have a look at the page you have created. Now click on “history”. Have a look at the different edit history. The wiki will save all your work so you can always go back to previous versions. This can come in handy if you make a major mistake or if there vandalism to your site.

===Evidence Base===

As with all evidence-based writing, you need to add sources/references to your claims. Have a quick look at the short video:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa0Nmv9qsd8 Youtube - Wikimedia Foundation - Verifiability]&lt;/br&gt;

In the work you have completed so far about yourself, find (or add something] that you can support with external evidence. Use the reference tool in the wiki to add the evidence. Save and check out the format. You may need to play around with the format until it makes some logical sense.

Metro Rail's five lines are linked through '''transfer stations''', which are stations that two or more lines pass through.  Sometimes, two lines follow the same track, called a '''concurency'''.  Metro Rail has 1 concurrency at this time and will have another in the future after the opening of the Expo Line.

==Transferring Made Easy==
Transferring between lines may seem complicated at first, but it's really not that hard.  Here is a guide for first-timers (source line is along the left and destination line is along the top):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | 
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Blue Line 
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Gold Line
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Green Line
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Red Line
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Purple Line
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | Blue Line
| N/A || Blue to 7th Street/Metro Center; Red/Purple to Los Angeles Union Station (serves Gold Line) || Blue to Imperial/Wilmington (serves Green Line) || Blue to 7th Street/Metro Center (serves Red Line) || Blue to 7th Street/Metro Center (serves Purple Line)
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | Gold Line
| Gold to Los Angeles Union Station; Red/Purple to 7th Street/Metro Center (serves Blue Line) || N/A || Gold to Los Angeles Union Station; Red/Purple to 7th Street/Metro Center; Blue to Imperial/Wilmington (serves Green Line) || Gold to Los Angeles Union Station (serves Red Line) || Gold to Los Angeles Union Station (serves Purple Line)
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | Green Line
| Green to Imperial/Wilmington (serves Blue Line) || Green to Imperial/Wilmington; Blue to 7th Street/Metro Center; Red/Purple to Los Angeles Union Station (serves Gold Line) || N/A || Green to Imperial/Wilmington; Blue to 7th Street/Metro Center (serves Red Line) || Green to Imperial/Wilmington; Blue to 7th Street/Metro Center (serves Purple Line)
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | Red Line
| Red to 7th Street/Metro Center (serves Blue Line) || Red to Los Angeles Union Station (serves Gold Line) || Red to 7th Street/Metro Center; Blue to Imperial/Wilmington (serves Green Line) || N/A || Concurrency (see below)
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | Purple Line
| Purple to 7th Street/Metro Center (serves Blue Line) || Purple to Los Angeles Union Station (serves Gold Line) || Red to 7th Street/Metro Center; Blue to Imperial/Wilmington (serves Green Line) || Concurrency (see below) || N/A
|}

==Concurrencies==
[[File:Metro Rail Concurrency.jpg|thumb|alt=A map of the concurrencies in the Metro Rail system, primarily in Downtown LA.|A map of the concurrencies in the Metro Rail system, primarily in Downtown LA.]]

A '''concurrency''' occurs when two or more lines run on the same track.  The Chicago Loop (more info in a future book, Getting around Chicago by Rail...maybe) is an extreme example, when 4 or 5 lines share the same track.  Metro Rail currently has 1 concurrency.  The Red Line and Purple Line share 6 stations between Los Angeles Union Station, the eastern terminus for both lines, and Wilshire/Vermont.  After Wilshire/Vermont, the Red Line stops at 8 more stations before terminating at North Hollywood and the Purple Line stops at Wilshire/Normandie and terminates at Wilshire/Western.  Since the Red/Purple concurrency travels through the heart of downtown, which makes it the most heavily used of all Metro lines, and the Purple Line goes to only have two stations of its own (no concurrency with Red), the Purple Line serves mainly to relieve the Red Line's heavy traffic.  Before its designation as a line in 2006, it used to be another branch of the Red Line.  In fact, if you exit from Wilshire/Normandie or Wilshire/Western, you'll notice that the markers are red.

In the future, the Expo Line will start at 7th Street/Metro Center, like the Blue Line, and share tracks with the Blue Line until the next station (Pico), where the Expo Line will continue along Exposition Blvd.  This will be the second concurrency Metro Rail will have.

The book appears to be abandoned and it appears to be biased towards www.thewrittenword.com bordering on SPAM. --[[User:Fasten|Bernhard Fastenrath]] 10:00, 25 June 2011 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px|alt=|link=]] '''Delete''' I did a Google search for some of the mentioned software and found nothing. I think it is self-promotion at best and nonsense at worse. A quick look through suggests there is no attempt to help people to understand what OpenSolaris is or how to use it. I believe anyone wanting to write a book about OpenSolaris would probably want to do so from scratch. [[CPAM with TWW]] seems to be by the same person as well. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:44, 25 June 2011 (UTC)

This book has not progressed very far.  It is redundant, as it is unlikely ever to contain anything not covered by [[Trigonometry]].  Further, it is not very comprehensible.  Probably, English is not the author's first language; this would explain the [[Trigonometry Course/Square Triangle|Square Triangle]].--[[User:Wisden|Wisden]] ([[User talk:Wisden|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wisden|contribs]]) 16:39, 24 February 2011 (UTC)

:'''Comment''' - 'Square triangle' may be acceptable in some places. It's like in BrE v. AmE, vert. opp. angles v. vertical angles. Who would imagine that the angle bisected by the axis of symmetry has anything to do with vert. opp. angles? :P [[::User:Kayau|Kayau]] {{toolbar|separator=dot

:I tend to deletion, but there are some ideas here that could be included in [[Trigonometry]]. I noticed the definitions of acute/right/obtuse/straight angles at [[Trigonometry Course/Angle]], which the otherwise much more complete book seems to lack. I don't have the patience to check whether there is also anything useful at [[Trigonometry Course/Derived Functions]].

I moved the book you began to the above title, to comply with [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]].  I'm not quite sure the title makes sense though.  Maybe it should be something like exercise as it relates to disease, or maybe &quot;Exercise and Disease&quot;.  Something to think about before you create too many pages. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:45, 7 August 2011 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The second order transfer function is the simplest one having complex poles.
Its analysis allows to recapitulate the information gathered about [[Signals_and_Systems/Filter_Design|analog filter design]] and serves as a good starting point for the realization of [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Signal_Processing/Analog_Filters#Chain_of_Second_Order_Sections chain of second order sections] filters.

== All-Pole Second Order Transfer Function ==

=== Transfer Function ===

The transfer function of a continuous-time all-pole second order system is:
: &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{b_0}{s^2 + a_1 s + a_0}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;s^2&lt;/math&gt; has been set to&amp;nbsp;1.
This simplifies the writing without any loss of generality, as numerator and denominator can be multiplied or divided by the same factor.

The [[Signals_and_Systems/Frequency_Response|frequency response]], taken for &lt;math&gt;s = i \omega&lt;/math&gt;, has a DC amplitude of: 
: &lt;math&gt;H(i \omega = 0) = \frac{b_0}{a_0}&lt;/math&gt;

For very high frequencies, the most important term of the denominator is &lt;math&gt;(i \omega)^2&lt;/math&gt; and the frequency response gets closer and closer to:
: &lt;math&gt;H(i \omega) \cong \frac{b_0}{(i \omega)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

At high frequencies, the amplitude response looks like a (squared) hyperbol in a linear plot and like a straight line with a negative slope in a log-log plot.
Plotting the frequencies in decades and the amplitude in decibels reveals a slope of -40&amp;nbsp;[dB/decade].

Having a given amplitude at DC and an amplitude nearing zero at high frequencies indicates that the transfer function is of lowpass type.

=== Poles ===

[[File:Complex conjugate poles.svg|thumb|Complex conjugate poles]]
The poles of the system are given by the roots of the denominator polynomial:
: &lt;math&gt;p, p^* = \frac{-a_1 \pm \sqrt{a_1^2 - 4 a_0}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
If the term inside the square root is negative, then the poles are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate complex conjugates].
This is the general case in filter design: there is poor interest in a second order transfer function having two real poles.

From the location of the poles, the transfer function can be rewritten as:
: &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{k}{(s-p)(s-p^*)} = \frac{k}{s^2 - 2 Re(p) s + abs(p)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The amplitude of the poles gives the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_frequency corner frequency] of the filter.
The corner frequency is defined as the abscissa of the point where the horizontal and the -40&amp;nbsp;[dB/decade] lines meet in the log-log magnitude response plot.
Note that this is not necessarily the -3&amp;nbsp;[dB] attenuation frequency of the filter.
: &lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = abs(p) = \sqrt{a_0}&lt;/math&gt;

The ratio between the real part of the poles and the corner frequency is proportional to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping_ratio damping], or inversely proportional to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor quality factor] of the system.
: &lt;math&gt;\zeta = \frac{-Re(p)}{\omega_0} = \frac{a_1}{2 \omega_0}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{1}{2 \zeta} = \frac{\omega_0}{-2 Re(p)} = \frac{\omega_0}{a_1}&lt;/math&gt;

The closer the poles are to the imaginary axis, the more a resonance will appear at a frequency smaller but close to the corner frequency of the system.

=== Transfer Function Rewritten ===

With this, the transfer function with unity gain at DC can be rewritten as a function of the corner frequency and the damping in the form:
: &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{\omega_0^2}{s^2 + 2 \zeta \omega_0 \cdot s + \omega_0^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Both &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; have a unit of [s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;].
&lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; has a unit of [1] and so does the total transfer function.

== Biquadratic Second Order Transfer Function ==

=== Transfer Function ===

The name biquadratic stems from the fact that the functions has two second order polynomials:
: &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{b_2 s^2 + b_1 s + b_0}{s^2 + a_1 s + a_0}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Poles ===

The poles are analysed in the same way as for an all-pole second order transfer function.
They determine the corner frequency and the quality factor of the system.

=== Zeroes ===

The zeroes are used to affect the shape of the amplitude response:
* Placing zeroes on the imaginary axis at frequencies a little higher than the corner frequency gives more attenuation in the stopband and allows a faster transition from passband to stopband. This is what happens with Chebyshev type&amp;nbsp;2 and elliptic [[Signals_and_Systems/Filter_Implementations|filter functions]].
* Placing the zeroes on the imaginary axis precisely at the corner frequency forces the amplitude to zero at that specific point. This corresponds to a bandstop (or notch) function.
* Placing a single zero at the (0, 0) coordinate of the s-plane transforms the function into a bandpass one. This is done by setting coefficients &lt;math&gt;b_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* Placing both zeroes at the (0, 0) coordinate transforms the function into a highpass one. This is done by setting coefficients &lt;math&gt;b_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* Placing the zeroes on the right half plane, symetrically to the poles gives an allpass function: any point on the imaginary axis is at the same distance from a zero and from the associated pole. This allpass function is used to shape the phase response of a transfer function.

== Example ==

=== 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Order Normalized Butterworth Filter ===

&lt;div style=&quot;background: #CCEEFF; border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]] This example analyses the 3 second order sections of a 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order normalized Butterworth filter.

[[File:Butterworth poles 6.svg|thumb|right|poles of a 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order Butterworth filter]]
The poles of the Butterworth filter are regularly spaced on the left half of a circle centered at the origin of the complex plane.
Each complex conjugate pole pair builds a second order all-pole transfer function.
The product of these second order functions gives the 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order Butterworth transfer function.

==== Pole Pairs ====

In the figure on the side, the pole &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; and its complex conjugate are close to the imaginary axis.
Their amplitude response will show an overshoot at the corner frequency.
This corresponds to an underdamped case and the second order section will show some resonance at frequencies close to the corner frequency.

The pole &lt;math&gt;p_2&lt;/math&gt; and its complex conjugate are at 45&amp;deg; in respect to the imaginary axis.
Their amplitude response will show 3&amp;nbsp;dB loss at the corner frequency.
It is the limiting case where the amplitude response shows no overshoot.
Nevertheless, this doesn't correspond to a critically damped case: the step response will have overshoots before stabilization.

The pole &lt;math&gt;p_3&lt;/math&gt; and its complex conjugate are far away from the imaginary axis.
Their amplitude response will show a large attenuation at the corner frequency.
This corresponds to an overdamped case.

==== Amplitude Responses ====

The following [[Octave_Programming_Tutorial|Octave]] code allows to plot the amplitude responses of the individual second order sections and of the global Butterworth amplitude response:

 #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 # Specifications
 #
 order = 6;
 pointNb = 100;
 wLog = logspace(-1, 1, pointNb);
 AdbMax = 10;
 AdbMin = -40;
 
 #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 # Butterworth filter
 #
 [num, den] = butter(order, 1, 's');
 while ( length(num) &lt; length(den) )
   num = [0, num];
 endwhile;
 
 #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 # Normalized filter, transfer functions plot
 #
 Adb = 20*log10(abs(freqs(num, den, wLog)));
 
 figure(2);
 semilogx(wLog, Adb);
 hold on;
 for index = 1:order
   if imag(poles(index)) &gt; 0
     num = [0, 0, 1];
     den = [1, -2*real(poles(index)), abs(poles(index))^2];
     Adb = 20*log10(abs(freqs(num, den, wLog)));
     semilogx(wLog, Adb, 'g');
   endif
 endfor
 hold off;
 
 axis([wLog(1), wLog(length(wLog)), AdbMin, AdbMax]);
 xlabel('Frequency');
 ylabel('Amplitude responses');
 grid;

[[File:Butterworth amplitudes 6.svg|thumb|amplitude response of the 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order Butterworth filter and its constituting second order sections]]
The blue curve on the side shows the global amplitude response.

The green curves are the responses of the individual second order sections.
They all have a hozizontal [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote asymptote] towards DC.
They also all have a -40&amp;nbsp;dB/decade asymptote for high frequencies.
Both asymptotes cross at the point (&lt;math&gt;\omega = 1&lt;/math&gt; [s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;], &lt;math&gt;A = 0&lt;/math&gt; [dB]).
The corner frequency is found at &lt;math&gt;\omega = 1&lt;/math&gt; [s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;] or &lt;math&gt;f = 1/{(2 \pi)}&lt;/math&gt; [Hz]

==== High-Q Second Order Function ====

The top green amplitude response shows what a response with a high quality factor looks like.
It has a maximum of more than 0&amp;nbsp;dB (here 6.02&amp;nbsp;dB) at a frequency a little below the corner frequency.
At the corner frequency, the amplitude has already fallen down (here to 5.68&amp;nbsp;dB).

==== Maximally Flat Second Order Function ====

The middle green amplitude response shows what a maximally flat response looks like.
It has an amplitude of -3.02&amp;nbsp;dB at the corner frequency.

Whatever its order, a Butterworth function shows the same -3.02&amp;nbsp;dB loss at the corner frequency.

==== Low-Q Second Order Function ====

The bottom green amplitude response shows what a response with a low quality factor looks like.
It has an amplitude of less than -3&amp;nbsp;dB (here -5.72&amp;nbsp;dB) at the corner frequency.

&lt;/div&gt;

===2b.  Journal your thoughts by asking these questions:===
*&quot;What did I learn about God?&quot;
*&quot;What did I learn about Myself?&quot;
*&quot;How can I apply this to my life today?&quot;
You may journal through writing, drawing, or through electronic process.

===3.  Memorize the Pathfinder Pledge and Law===

====The Pathfinder Pledge and Law====
'''Pledge'''&lt;br /&gt;
By the grace of God I will be pure, kind, and true.&lt;br /&gt;
I will keep the pathfinder law&lt;br /&gt;
I will be a servant of God and a friend to man.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
♦	&quot;By the grace of God&quot; means that I will rely on Him, realizing that His strength is made perfect in my weakness. It means that only as I rely on God can I do His will. It means that only through grace are we saved from our sins through the power of Jesus Christ our Savior and Redeemer.&lt;br /&gt;
♦	&quot;I will be pure&quot; means I will rise above the wicked world in which I live and keep my life clean with words and actions that will make others happy.&lt;br /&gt;
♦	&quot;I will be kind&quot; means that I will be considerate and kind not only to my fellow men but to all of God's creation as well.&lt;br /&gt;
♦	&quot;I will be true&quot; means that I will be honest and upright in study, work and play and can always be counted on to do my very best.&lt;br /&gt;
♦	&quot;I will keep the Pathfinder Law&quot; means that I will seek to understand the meaning of the Pathfinder Law and will strive to live up to its spirit, realizing that obedience to law is essential in any organization.&lt;br /&gt;
♦	&quot;I will be a servant of God&quot; means that I pledge myself to serve God first, last and best in everything I am called upon to be or do.&lt;br /&gt;
♦	&quot;I will be a friend to man&quot; means that I will live to bless others and do unto them as I would have them do unto me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Law'''&lt;br /&gt;
The Pathfinder Law is for me to:&lt;br /&gt;
Keep the morning watch&lt;br /&gt;
Do my honest part&lt;br /&gt;
Keep a level eye&lt;br /&gt;
Be courteous and obedient&lt;br /&gt;
Walk softly in the sanctuary&lt;br /&gt;
Keep a song in my heart&lt;br /&gt;
Go on God's errands&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
♦	Keep the Morning Watch. Every boy and girl should have prayer and Bible study every day. The best way to start the day is by studying the Morning Watch which has been prepared as a daily devotional for every Seventh-day Adventist junior boy and girl.
The first food I need is the Word of God. I will study and meditate upon it and make it part of my daily devotions.
I will pray, thanking God for His blessings and asking Him for the things I and others need. God has promised to hear me.
I will share what I have learned in the Word of God with my family and others. I want Jesus to come soon, and I want others to know Him personally as I do. I will keep the Morning Watch because it is the plan of God to enrich my life and prepare me for His kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
♦	Do My Honest Part. &quot;The world does not so much need men of great intellect as of noble character.&quot; Education, page 225.
&quot;A character formed according to the divine likeness is the only treasure that we can take from this world to the next. Those who are under the instruction of Christ in this world will take every divine attainment with them to the heavenly mansions. And in heaven we are continually to improve. How important then, is the development of character in this life.&quot; Messages to Young People, pages 100, 101.
Recognizing this great need in the world and in my life I will not be afraid of anything that is my duty. I will cheerfully carry all my responsibilities at home, in school, and in the church. I will show good sportsmanship in play and always strive to do my best.
I will do my honest part by keeping out of trouble, taking care of my money, respecting that which is not mine and faithfully carrying out all my responsibilities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
♦	Care for My Body. &quot;One of the greatest aids in perfecting pure and noble characters in the young, strengthening them to control appetite and refrain from debasing excesses, is sound physical health.&quot; Messages to Young People, page 233.
I recognize that the time to establish good habits, to learn self-control and to keep a healthy body is in my youth. I also recognize that my body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and that I have been entrusted with its care. It is my responsibility to learn principles and norms which will help me live happily and free from the vices and corruptions of the world.
I will endeavor to keep my body strong by deep breathing, exercise, proper diet and dress, and by refraining from the use of alcohol, tobacco, tea, coffee and drugs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
♦	Keep a Level Eye. At Fort Lincoln, Washington, D.C., there is a statue of Christ which appears to look in all directions. No matter where you stand the eyes of the Lord are upon you. The Bible says: &quot;The eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good.&quot; Proverbs 15:3.
Keeping a level eye means that no matter where we are, out in the open or in the dark alleys of life, we can look at Jesus straight in the eye and not be afraid.
Adam and Eve ran from the presence of God. They could not face Him because they had sinned. In order to keep a level eye, I must not lie or deceive. I will tell the truth even if it hurts. I will despise filthy thinking and dirty talk. I will think more of others than of myself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
♦	Be Courteous and Obedient. &quot;The golden rule is the principle of true courtesy, and its truest illustration is seen in the life and character of Jesus. Oh, what rays of softness and beauty shone forth in the daily life of our Saviour! What sweetness flowed from His very presence! The same spirit will be revealed in His children.&quot; Messages to Young People, page 420.
I want to be courteous because courtesy is love shining out of a heart that reflects the love of Jesus. I will always give a kindly greeting and ever be ready to help the stranger, the aged, the sick, the poor, and the little ones.
I realize that obedience to God must come first, obedience to parents next and obedience to teachers and other persons in authority follow. I want to follow the example of Jesus, who was obedient even unto death on the cross. He came to fulfill a mission and was obedient to His heavenly Father.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
♦	Walk Softly in the Sanctuary. When Moses went into the presence of God to receive the Ten Commandments the people were told to sanctify them-selves and to wash their clothes. They were to be reverent before the God of the universe. &quot;Children and youth should never feel that it is something to be proud of to be indifferent and careless in meetings where God is worshiped.&quot; Messages to Young People, page 266.
I will walk softly in the sanctuary, making my feet, my hands, and my heart fit the time and place. God is in the church building, because it is dedicated to His service. In the church I will be quiet, careful and reverent in all I do and say.
I will be reverent in prayer; I will close my eyes and have a proper posture as I talk to God.
I will respect the sanctuary, its buildings, its furniture; I will not talk to my peers; I will remember that the angels cover themselves in humility as they approach the throne of God.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
♦	Keep a Song in My Heart. &quot;The melody of praise is the atmosphere of heaven; and when heaven comes in touch with the earth there is music and song-'thanksgiving and the voice of melody.'&quot; Messages to Young People, page 291.
We know that music is as much an act of worship as is prayer. Many times youth do not understand this and songs are sung without meaning. We must learn to praise God here on earth, for this will be one of the themes of eternity. There should be joy in our hearts because Jesus came and died on the cross for all of us.
I will keep a song in my heart because I am happy, because I've been redeemed. I will sing while I am alone and while I am with others. I want them to feel the joy of salvation with me, the joy of a Christian, the happiness one experiences with Christ. I will sing when things are right and I will sing when things are wrong. I know that trials and tribulations are God's way of teaching and molding me.
&quot;Let there be singing in the home, of songs that are sweet and pure, and there will be fewer words of censure, and more of cheerfulness and hope and joy. Let there be singing in the school, and the pupils will be drawn closer to God, to their teachers, and to one another.&quot; Messages to Young People, page 292.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
♦	Go On God's Errands. The supreme purpose of every Adventist Junior Youth is to do God's work. &quot;Children can be acceptable missionary workers in the home and in the church. God desires them to be taught that they are in this world for useful service, not merely for play. In the home they can be trained to do missionary work that will prepare them for wider spheres of usefulness. Parents, help your children to fulfill God's purpose for them.&quot; Messages to Young People, page 225.&lt;br /&gt;

===Beeston Castle===
[[Image:Beeston Castle Gate.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A modern bridge provides access to the gateway of the inner ward at Beeston Castle.]]
Beeston Castle is in Beeston, Cheshire and is perched on a rocky sandstone crag 350 ft above the Cheshire Plain. It was built in the 1220s by Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, on his return from the Crusades. In 1237, Henry III took over the ownership of Beeston, and it was kept in good repair until the 16th century, when it was considered to be of no further military use, although it was pressed into service again in 1643, during the Civil War. The castle was slighted in 1646, in accordance with Cromwell's destruction order, to prevent its further use as a stronghold. During the 18th century the site was used as a quarry.

Unlike many other castles of the period, Beeston does not have a keep as its last line of defence. Instead the natural features of the land together with massive walls, strong gate houses, and carefully positioned towers made the baileys themselves the stronghold. The defences consisted of two parts. Firstly, an inner ward on the summit of the hill, with a sheer drop on three sides and a defensive ditch up to 30 ft deep in places cut into the rock on the fourth side. Secondly, an outer bailey was built on the lower slopes, with a massive gatehouse protected by a 16 ft wide and 10 ft deep ditch.

The outer bailey was roughly rectangular, with 6 ft thick walls faced in sandstone and infilled with rubble. The walls, parts of which still remain, contain a number of D-shaped towers, an innovation in English castles at that time. The towers allowed defenders to fire across the walls as well as forwards, and their open-backed design meant that they would not offer cover to any attackers who gained access to the outer bailey. The inner bailey was situated on the rocky summit at the western end of the crag.
To provide the castle's inhabitants with a supply of fresh water two wells were dug into the rock, one of them, at 370 ft deep, one of the deepest castle wells in England.

===Chester Castle===
[[File:Chestercastle.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Chester Castle]]
Chester Castle is in the city of Chester and is sited at the south west extremity of the area bounded by the city walls.  The castle stands on an eminence overlooking the River Dee. In the castle complex are the remaining parts of the medieval castle. The castle was built in 1070 by Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester. It is possible that it was built on the site of an earlier Saxon fortification but this has not been confirmed. The original structure would have been a motte and bailey castle with a wooden tower.  In the 12th century the wooden tower was replaced by a square stone tower, the Flag Tower.  During the same century the stone gateway to the inner bailey was built.  This is now known as the Agricola Tower and on its first floor is the chapel of St Mary de Castro. In the 13th century, during the reign of Henry III, the walls of an outer bailey were built, the gateway in the Agricola Tower was blocked up and residential accommodation, including a Great Hall, was built along the south wall of the inner bailey.  Later in the century, during the reign of Edward I, a new gateway to the outer bailey was built.  This was flanked by two half-drum towers and had a drawbridge over a moat.  Further additions to the castle at this time included individual chambers for the King and Queen, a new chapel and stables.

During the Civil War Chester was held by the Royalists. The castle was assaulted by Parliamentary forces in July 1643, and in January and April 1645. Together with the rest of the city, it was besieged between September 1645 and February 1646.  Following the civil war the castle was used as a prison, a court and a tax office.

===Cholmondeley Castle===
[[image:Cholmondeley Castle.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Cholmondeley Castle]]
Cholmondeley Castle is a country house in Cholmondeley, Cheshire. It is surrounded by a 7,500 acre estate. The present house was built between 1801 and 1804 by George Cholmondeley, 1st Marquess of Cholmondeley. It was designed by the local architect William Turner who was directed by the Marquess to give it the appearance of &quot;an old Gothic Castle&quot;. In 1817–1819 turrets and towers were added to give it its present castle like appearance. An earlier house had been on the site dating from 1571. This was constructed of brick and timber framing and had been remodelled by Sir John Vanbrugh between 1713 and 1715.

===Doddington Castle===
[[File:Geograph-2193224-by-Simon-Huguet.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Doddington Castle, also known as Delves Hall]]
Doddington Castle, sometimes known as Delves Hall, is a fortified structure in Doddington Park to the north of Doddington Hall, Cheshire. The fortified tower was built by Sir John Delves in 1364 on the site of a former moated manor house.  The tower was initially free-standing and was probably intended as a place of refuge for the family. In the 17th century it was incorporated into a range of domestic buildings which were known as Doddington Hall. In the Civil War the hall became a garrison for the parliamentary forces.  It was taken for the king by John Byron, 1st Baron Byron in January 1644 but retaken shortly after. The house was demolished around 1777 and replaced by the new Doddington Hall, leaving the tower as a landscape feature which was possibly used as a gazebo or a banqueting pavilion.

===Halton Castle===
[[File:Halton Castle.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Part of Halton Castle ruins in 2006]]
Halton Castle is in the former village of Halton, Cheshire which is now part of the town of Runcorn. The castle is situated on the top of Halton Hill overlooking the village. It was the seat of the Barons of Halton from the 11th century until the 14th century and it then passed to the Duchy of Lancaster. It was besieged twice in the Civil War after which its structure deteriorated. In the 18th century a new courthouse was built on the site of the previous gatehouse. The castle lies in ruins apart from the courthouse which has been converted into a public house.

Following the Norman conquest, the Barony of Halton was established by Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester. The first baron to be appointed was Nigel of Cotentin and it is almost certain that he would have built a motte and bailey castle on the site, constructing it from wood, although the excavations in 1986–87 showed no evidence of a motte and bailey structure or of a timber tower or palisade. It is most probable that during the 12th century the wooden structure was replaced by a castle built from the local sandstone although no documentary evidence of this remains. Details of the building works are obscure but it has been suggested that John of Gaunt, the 14th baron, made alterations to the castle but this again has not been confirmed by documentary evidence. When the 15th baron, Henry Bolingbroke, ascended the throne as King Henry IV, the castle became the property of the Duchy of Lancaster.

The earliest documentary evidence of building work at Halton Castle shows that during the 15th century and into the 16th century it was regularly maintained. Between 1450 and 1457 a new gate tower was built. A survey of the Royal Palaces in 1609 suggests that by then the castle had fallen into disrepair. During the Tudor period it was used less as a fortress and more as a prison, an administrative centre, and a court of law.

At the outbreak of the Civil War the castle was garrisoned by the Royalists under the command of Captain Walter Primrose who had been appointed by Earl Rivers. It was besieged by Parliamentary forces under Sir William Brereton in 1643, and the Royalists eventually surrendered after several weeks. On hearing of the approach of superior Royalist forces led by Prince Rupert, the Parliamentarians abandoned the castle and it was held again for the Royalists under Colonel Fenwick. There was a second siege in 1644 but, as the fortunes of the Royalists declined elsewhere, they withdrew from Halton and the Parliamentarians under Sir William Brereton re-occupied the castle. In 1646 a &quot;Council of War&quot; was held in Warrington where it was decided that the defences of the castles at Halton and Beeston Castle were to be dismantled. In time this was achieved and Halton castle was to have no further military function. By 1650 the castle was said to be &quot;very ruinous&quot;.

===Peckforton Castle===
[[File:Peckforton Castle 1.jpg|thumb|left|Peckforton Castle from the courtyard showing the hall and the round tower]]
Peckforton Castle is a country house built in the style of a medieval castle. It stands in woodland at the north end of Peckforton Hills one mile north west of the village of Peckforton, Cheshire. The house was built in the middle of the 19th century as a family home for John Tollemache, 1st Baron Tollemache, a wealthy Cheshire landowner, estate manager, and Member of Parliament. It was designed by Anthony Salvin in the Gothic style.  

[[File:Peckforton Front Gate.jpg|thumb|right|View of the front gate of Peckforton Castle.]]
The castle was built between 1844 and 1850 by Dean and Son of Leftwich, with Joseph Cookson of Tarporley acting as clerk of works. Stone was obtained from a quarry about one mile to the west of the site, and a railway was built to carry the stone. The castle cost £60,000. 

The castle is faced with red sandstone and has lead, asphalt and tile roofs. It is mainly in three storeys with a five-storey tower. The buildings are arranged around a ward with the principal accommodation on the north side. It is surrounded by a dry moat which is bridged at the gatehouse. To the west of the inner ward are the stables, the coach house, a rectangular bell tower and the kitchens and service area. To the north is the great hall range which consists of 18 bays. Behind the entrance to the hall is the circular main tower. At the east end of the gallery wing is the octagonal library tower. The outer walls of the castle have full-height slender turrets at the changes in direction. Corbel tables support part of the battlements. The walls contain arrow slots, and in the gatehouse is a garderobe. The flat roof has a crenellated parapet.

The castle had no formal garden, but at the bottom of the drive were kitchen gardens which included vegetable gardens, an orchard, extensive glass houses and a large orangery.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{bigwelcome}}
I have noted your recent edit to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1]], but unfortunately, I had to remove it. Your two base assumptions are wrong:

# The Killing Curse does not cause destruction. It is a curse of power, and can cause destruction when it misses its mark, but in the case in question it did not; it hit Voldy square on, else he would not have died. When it was used against the spider in OotP it caused the spider to quietly die; when it was used against Dumbledore in HBP he was thrown over the battlements -- or did he fall? already weakened, he had, if I recall correctly, regained his feet while talking to Draco, and could have simply overbalanced when he died -- but no damage was done to the tower.
# It is true that Pettigrew was the only secret-keeper, but that does not imply that he was the only one who knew where the Potters were. The secret keeper can let anyone else in on the secret, if he chooses, and Sirius was certainly in on it as he sent Harry a toy broom, viz. the letter in Sirius' room in DH. Additionally, of course, Pettigrew had let Voldy in on the secret. The discussion that you removed says nothing about Sirius or Hagrid being SK, only that they could have been let in on the secret.

I do hope I haven't discouraged you, and that you'll continue editing, but perhaps you might read a little more carefully before excising big chunks of text? Thank you. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:07, 7 August 2011 (UTC)

:Thank you for your comments. Of course, I still have to argue; how could I be a WB editor if I didn't?

:#You are correct that curses of power, which of course includes the Killing Curse, will cause explosive-type damage '''if they miss'''. We see that over and over again in Wizarding battles. However, if they hit, they have the intended effect and little else. No fire is set on the desk when the false Moody kills the spider in GoF. There is no explosion when Voldemort is killed by his own curse at the end of DH (chapter 36). Or when the killing curse rebounds on him in the Forbidden Forest in DH:34. There is no explosion when Dumbledore is killed by Snape in HBP. And going back to original sources, DH:17 does have a sign that says the house was left in its ruined state, but also the house itself, which we see, is damaged only in the area of the one bedroom. DH:17 makes no conclusions about what caused the damage. I'm going to suggest that no Wiki, not even ours, should be taken as authoritative.
:#In the matter of Pettigrew as secret-keeper, rather than excising the speculation, which still has some value, it would be better to reword to point out that Hagrid's seeing the house meant either that he was one of those who was privy to the secret, or that the Fidelius spell ended when the secret it was protecting ended. In fact, I believe the current wording is intended to show that, but may not be pointed enough.
:Your thoughts? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:55, 8 August 2011 (UTC)

::Well, an... interesting... point of view.
::#We know that the house was not demolished, because (also in DH:17) &quot;This house... has been left in its ruined state&quot;, the &quot;right side of the top floor had been blown apart&quot;. Damaged, effectively ruined, yes, but not demolished, not flat destroyed. As Voldemort had just been effectively killed at the point which you refer to, his memory about how much damage there was must, perforce, be suspect, and the rubble that he refers to may not have existed anywhere except in his own ruined mind. Again I point out that in the Forbidden Forest, and in the Great Hall, in DH:34 and DH:36 respectively, there is exactly the same rebound onto Voldemort, and no explosions or damage to anyone other than Voldy result.
::#I have already rewritten that chunk of text to eliminate the &quot;multiple secret-keepers&quot; error and the associated &quot;Sirius could tell Hagrid&quot; misapprehension. I'm not sure the paragraph should be shortened as much as you suggest, because we are never told outright whether Hagrid is privy to the secret; in the interests of fostering some critical thought, I would like to retain the rationale for our guesses about Hagrid's understanding.
::Back to you... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:36, 13 August 2011 (UTC)

:::With point 2 more or less resolved, I would like to draw your attention back to the chapter in question.
:::#As it is unlikely that we will ever resolve this &amp;ndash; the rebounding Killing Curse in DH:36 was powerful enough to end Voldemort, whether or not the Elder Wand was truly his; why would it not have given the same sort of explosion, if any, that wrecked Harry's bedroom? &amp;ndash; I am going to suggest that we leave it as speculation, lay out both sides and reasoning in the text and allow the student to make up his own mind. To that end, I have expanded that bit of text to include much of your reasoning and my counter-reasoning.
:::In general, in a text of this sort, it is better when there is some debate, to lay out the debate and the reasons involved, and allow the student to think it through and form his own conclusions, than to simply claim one side of the debate is correct and banish all other interpretations. We have been through this before... another editor and myself had a bit of an argument over whether Fenrir Greyback was transformed when he attacked Hogwarts in DH:32. A lot of that debate is on the talk page, but we sort of distilled it down onto the analysis page for that chapter.

== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 1]] ==

I am very sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to back out these two big deletions.

In cases where there is some question, it is a good idea to keep the rationale for making a decision, rather than just leaving it as a given. I understand your feelings about this, but in fact not everyone reading this text will understand that Muggles are unable to perceive Dementors; and so the explanatory notes should remain, albeit perhaps modified base don what we have learned in the story since.

Thank you. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:01, 15 August 2011 (UTC)

:After a day or so of no response, I backed out the changes and modified the text to indicate that there is some dispute. Please check what I've written, and feel free to edit if you feel it's warranted... but please don't wholesale delete. I'm afraid that we can't take the author's word as gospel, either, as apart from the occasional [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marcus Flint|flint]], things she says in interviews often directly contradict things in the books.
:Just as an aside, it is judicious ambiguity, in many cases, that makes a re-reading worthwhile. Because of that, it is probably better to highlight and comment on ambiguity than to come down hard on one side or the other.

Hi Soupmix,

I have long had the idea to create an AY Instructor's Manual modeled after the Honors Answer Book.  I have not done that here at Wikibooks though because of my concern that we could not possibly meet the Neutral Point of View policy in force here.  Unfortunately, I do not think that an IA book would survive a vote for deletion. :-(

When the new IA curriculum was announced, I shared this vision with Mark O'Ffill, asking if it would be possible to host a Wiki on pathfindersonline.org.  On the same day that I had done that, Brad Forbes from AdventSource had asked Mark what it would take to set up a Wiki for an IA Instructor's Manual - modeled after the Honors Answer Book, and hosted by the NAD.  Mark put me in touch with Brad, and I had an pretty long phone call with him on this.  The project has a green light, but it is moving far too slowly for my comfort.

You can read more about this on the Pathfinder Forum: http://www.pathfindersonline.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=60&amp;t=1939

You'll have to scroll down to get to the part about the Wiki.  If you would like to discuss this via email, please do not hesitate to contact me at jomegat at jomegat dot com, or drop a note in the forum. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 15:04, 8 August 2011 (UTC)


Do you think they would have a problem with neutrality on something like this?  [[User:Soupmix|Soupmix]] ([[User talk:Soupmix|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Soupmix|contribs]]) 17:19, 8 August 2011 (UTC)

:Yes.  I am sure that the old AY curricula would have had NPOV problems, which is why I didn't start a book for that three years ago.  I don't think that the requirements of the new curricula per se present a problem, but it would be very difficult for someone to remain neutral when providing guidance on meeting the requirements.  For example, the Adventist position that Ellen White was a prophet, or that Jesus was the Son of God would not be considered neutral.  These are statements of belief that cannot be proven (which is not the same as saying that they are untrue).  To get around that would require all kinds of acrobatic wording which would neuter belief.  

:Of course, I could be wrong about these supposed NPOV problems, but since the NAD is moving forward on the same project, I think it would be better to wait -  at least a little while - for them to get something in place.  I would like to say that this will happen very soon, but in reality, I don't know when they will get the ball rolling.  It '''should''' be soon, and in fact, I was expecting something to happen on it over a month ago. The advantage of waiting is that the NAD wiki will be structured such that the requirements will be protected from editing, while the guidance portions will be publicly editable.  It will be the NAD official resource (the Honors Answers are not official, but they are indeed moving in that direction). --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 19:03, 8 August 2011 (UTC)

::Hi Soupmix.  There has been some progress on the NAD-hosted wiki front.  We don't have it at the correct domain yet, but I have copied all the Honors Answers to the new wiki and have started on the IA Instructor's Manual.  It is still very much a work in progress, but it will not have any NPOV problems, and we can host images of PF insignia there without issues. For now, the Wiki is located [http://www.investitureachievement.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page here].  I'm not ready to tell the world about this yet, but since you are actively developing content, you should know about it.  When we get our &quot;real&quot; domain name, then we'll be ready.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 23:03, 18 July 2012 (UTC)

Many of the great engineering achievements beginning at the earliest times through the present have been associated with providing a reliable water supply and with disposing of wastewater. The Roman aqueducts that supplied Rome and other cities with drinking water between 300 BC and AD 300 are one example of this. The sewer system in London developed during the late 1800s is another example. Because of these engineering accomplishments, most people in the developed world have access to safe drinking water.

In this section, we investigate the relationship between engineering and water. We first describe the concept of water quality standards and how drinking water should meet these standards. We then describe the techniques engineers have developed to provide '''potable''' water and to treat wastewater so that it does not unduly '''pollute''' the environment.

==Water Quality Standards==
Most of us know that the water we receive from our local municipalities is treated. The treatment of water has to follow water quality standards. In the United States, the development of water quality standards began in the early twentieth century. Over time, these water quality standards have evolved and have become more rigorous. Laws and regulations such as the Clean Water Act govern water quality standards in the United States. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the mission of protecting human health and the environment. The EPA has created water quality standards that define the goals for a
body of water and specify its uses. They establish criteria to protect those water uses. They also establish requirements to protect water from pollutants.

In general, a water quality standard consists of four basic elements (EPA):

# Designated uses of the water body (e.g., recreation, water supply, aquatic life, agriculture).
# Water quality criteria to protect designated uses (numeric pollutant concentrations and narrative requirements).
# An antidegradation policy to maintain and protect existing uses and high-quality waters.
# General policies addressing implementation issues (e.g., low flows, variances, mixing zones).

State governments are required to identify the appropriate uses for water bodies. These uses are identified by taking into consideration the value of the water body for various uses. The uses for a water body can include any of the following: public water supply, protection of fish, shellfish, and wildlife, recreation, agriculture, industry, and navigation. In making these designations, the appropriate authorities must examine whether the water body is suitable for the intended use. This determination is made based on the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the water body, its geographical setting and scenic qualities, and economic considerations.

==Drinking Water==
The quality of drinking water differs from one location to another. Quality is dependent on the condition of the water source and the treatment. Each local community water supplier is required to provide an annual report, sometimes known as a &quot;consumer confidence report&quot; to the public. This report usually provides information on the quality of the local drinking water, its source, and the '''contaminants''' found in the water (Figure 7).

[[File:NYC water sampling station.jpg|400px|thumb|center|'''Figure 3.7''': The city of New York monitors its drinking water to ensure that it is safe. This sign marks the location of a station where the drinking water is sampled.]]

Scientists report the contaminants in water as contaminants in parts per million (ppm), parts per billion (ppb), and parts per trillion. When water contaminant measurements are reported in this manner, you may wonder: How can amounts of contaminants that seem so very small cause health problems? Scientific research has shown that, for example, lead concentrations as small as 15 ppb can be harmful to infants and children. The smell of petroleum products in water can be detected by humans even when the amount of petroleum in water is as low as 10 ppb.

It is very important to note that there is no such thing as naturally pure water. All water in nature contains some sort of impurities. Since water is a good solvent, as it flows through various layers of soil and over rocks, it dissolves minerals. These minerals in the water may get the taste (good or bad). However, if these minerals are above a certain level, they could be harmful.

Have you ever thought about where your drinking water comes from? Many of us take the drinking water we get when we turn on our kitchen faucet for granted. The water in many urban areas comes from surface sources such as lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. These sources can be near the urban areas or far away. Water suppliers procure and treat the water they provide. It is important to consider the entire watershed that provides the water. A watershed is the land from which '''precipitation''' (usually rain or snow) flows into the river, lake, or reservoir.

In many urban and rural areas, water also comes from ground water that is pumped from a well. Wells provide water from aquifers, which are natural water reservoirs under the earth's surface. Aquifers may lie under parts of several states or may only be a few miles wide. Thus, water quality is affected not only by the water source such as a river or well that we can see, but also by activities that occur many miles away.

Before the water is delivered to our homes, the water is treated. The treatment of drinking water that is most common is disinfection. Water suppliers add chlorine or another disinfectant to kill bacteria and germs in the water. This commonplace drinking water treatment is considered to be one of the most important scientific advancements of the twentieth century.

{{Robox|theme=8|title=Activity}}
'''Common water treatment methods''': Before we examine a water treatment plant, list and describe some common ways to treat water or purify water for drinking that you can do at home or during emergencies.

'''Materials needed''': Internet-accessible computer, science textbooks.

'''Suggested phrases for searching on the Internet''': Water purification at home, Water purification during emergencies, Common water purification methods.

'''Directions''': Working alone or in a group, brainstorm a list of ways in which drinking water might be bad. From your list, identify problems that might need to be treated. Brainstorm a second list of ways to obtain good drinking water in your home. Do any of these solve the problems identified on your first list?

Using the Internet, research news stories related to water supply and water problems in your local community. How do the results of your research compare to your first list of potential problems with water? Are there problems that you did not anticipate?

Research information on water purification techniques that can be used at home. Discuss in small groups what you learned from your research. Prepare a chart with a brief description of common water problems and the treatment/purification methods appropriate to each problem; include a list of materials you would need for each treatment method and illustrate each method by making your own drawing.

'''Hints''': Filtration, Boiling, Distillation, Water Softeners, Reverse Osmosis

'''Extensions''': What will be the cost of implementing these home-based water  purification techniques if you were to need clean water for a family of four? How would you go about determining the amount of water that you will need? What is the most effective method in terms of removing impurities for the quantity of water you need for a family for four for drinking/food purposes?

==Water Treatment Basics==
Municipalities must perform two types of water treatment: treatment of water before it is used for drinking and other purposes, and treatment of wastewater such as sewage so that it is safe to return to the environment. Typically, drinking water is treated based on the quality of the source water. Ground water, for instance, usually requires less treatment than surface water from a river or a lake. Thus, the quality of the water that enters your community water treatment plant determines how the water will be treated prior to distribution.

Wastewater includes sewage as well as water used in industrial and agricultural processes.  It flows out of homes and neighborhoods through sewage pipes to a wastewater treatment plant. Here, the wastewater is treated to remove solids and contaminants. The treated wastewater may be re-used for irrigation and landscaping. The treated wastewater is also returned to streams, rivers, and oceans, which can also be a source of pollution.

Treatment plants for drinking water and for wastewater have equipment and processes to remove or destroy harmful materials and organisms. A treatment plant uses tanks and mechanical parts such as valves and pumps to move the water through the different processes.  These processes are designed and managed by water engineers. Other engineering specialties, including mechanical and construction engineering, play a role in the construction and maintenance of water treatment plants.

==Drinking Water Treatment==
Water from rivers, lakes, and streams or ground water is pumped and transported to a drinking water treatment facility. Then the water is processed through various units to prepare the water for distribution to homes. The water treatment involves the steps shown in Figure 8 and described below.

[[File:Illustration of a typical drinking water treatment process.png|frame|center|'''Figure 3.8''': Illustration of a typical drinking water treatment process.]]

'''Coagulation'''. First, dirt and other particles must be removed from the water. Flocculants are chemicals such as alum (aluminum potassium sulfate) that cause the dirt and other particles to stick together; flocculants are added to the water, which creates larger particles called floc.

'''Sedimentation'''. As the water moves through the sedimentation tanks, the floc particles settle to the bottom of the tank. The clear water then flows to a filtration unit.

'''Filtration'''. Filtration removes small particles from the water by passing it through layers of sand, gravel and charcoal. The water then moves to disinfection before storage.

'''Disinfection'''. Water is disinfected with chlorine or other chemicals, called disinfectants, to kill any bacteria and other harmful organisms. The amount of disinfectants added to the water has to be carefully adjusted, because too much may be harmful to humans, but too little will not kill the harmful organisms.

'''Storage'''. After disinfection, the water is stored in storage tanks until it is needed for distribution to homes, businesses, and other water users.

What are the mechanisms that maintain water pressure during peak water usage times in urban areas? You can easily imagine that in most urban cities, water usage will peak during certain times of the day. Have you wondered how the water flow rate and the pressure at which the water flows out of your home's faucets is maintained during the mornings when most people are preparing to leave for school or work? This is a time when water use is high as people brush their teeth, shower, and use water for personal hygiene.

'''Materials needed''': Internet-accessible computer, science textbooks.

'''Suggested phrases for searching on the Internet''': Water pressure, water flow during peak water usage times

'''Directions''': Research and review information on how water delivery systems or local municipalities or your city's water supply systems regulate water flow and water pressure during peak times. Discuss in small groups what you learned from your research. Prepare a brief essay that describes the mechanisms or techniques used by water suppliers to maintain water flow and pressure during peak times. Illustrate this technique by making your own drawing.

'''Hint''': Have you seen water tower tanks in cities that are in flat areas? Research what purpose these water tower tanks serve. What do water pumps do? Research the various ways in which a city or municipal water supply system uses water pumps.

==Wastewater Treatment==
Before wastewater can be released into the environment, it is treated in a wastewater treatment plant. An aerial view of a wastewater treatment plant is shown in Figure 9. Figure 10 illustrates the steps involved in the treatment of wastewater. We describe the steps in more detail below.

[[File:Luftbild Klaeranlage Dresden Kaditz.jpg|thumb|center|500px|'''Figure 3.9''': An aerial view of a wastewater treatment plant in Dresden, Germany.]]
[[File:Steps in a typical wastewater treatment process.png|frame|center|'''Figure 3.10''': Steps in a typical wastewater treatment process.]]

'''Pumping'''. Wastewater treatment facilities are usually located on low ground so that '''gravity''' will move sewage from homes to the treatment plant. Usually, pumps are needed to lift the sewage as it enters the treatment facility. The treatment facility uses gravity to move the wastewater through the treatment process.

'''Bar screen'''. As it enters the treatment plant, wastewater may contain large items such as plastic bottles, cans, sticks, rocks, and even dead animals. These items are removed by the bar screen and sent to a landfill. If they are not removed, they will damage equipment in the treatment plant.

'''Grit chamber'''. After screening, wastewater enters the grit chamber in which larger particles (such as sand or dirt) settle out of the water. Often, the water is aerated (air is bubbled through it) to keep smaller particles from settling out. Aeration causes some of the gases that are dissolved in the water (e.g. hydrogen sulfide that smells like rotten eggs) to be released.

'''Sedimentation tank'''. In the sedimentation tank (also known as the primary clarifier), solids settle to the bottom as sludge and scum floats to the top. The sludge is pumped out of the primary clarifier and sent to the solids processing facility. The scum is composed of lighter materials such as grease, oil, soap, and so forth. Slow-moving rakes are used to collect the scum from the surface of the wastewater.

'''Secondary aeration and clarifier'''. The wastewater is exposed to air in an aerator, which provides oxygen for microorganisms that help break down contaminants in the water. This may be done by spraying the wastewater into the air or by bubbling air through the wastewater. The aerated effluent is passed into a secondary clarifier, which is a large tank or pond; in the clarifier, microorganisms decompose organic material and absorb nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The microorganisms and remaining solids settle out of the effluent as activated sludge. Most of the activated sludge is pumped to the solids processing facility, while the remaining sludge is pumped into the wastewater entering the aerator. This introduces additional microorganisms to the wastewater to hasten the breakdown of organic matter.

'''Filtration'''. Filtration may be used to further reduce the organic matter in the water. The water is filtered through a substance, usually sand and rocks. During this filtration process, most bacteria are removed, turbidity and color in the wastewater are reduced, odors are removed, the amount of iron content in the wastewater is reduced, and any other solids that may have remained in the water are also removed. This water may subsequently be filtered again through a carbon filter such as charcoal to remove organic particles.

'''Disinfection'''. To kill remaining harmful bacteria and other pathogens in the processed wastewater, chlorine and other chemicals are added in a disinfection tank. The chlorine can be harmful if added in excess quantities. (You may have noticed the smell of chlorine or have had irritated eyes when you were exposed to chlorine in a swimming pool.) Therefore, in some cases, the chlorine must be neutralized with other chemicals after it has killed the bacteria to protect marine organisms.

'''Solids processing'''. Solids include the sludge and scum removed in the sedimentation tank and the activated sludge removed from the secondary clarifier. These solids may be processed further in devices called digesters, which are heated and enclosed tanks. The solid wastes are kept in these tanks for 20–30 days to reduce the volume of the material, reduce odors, and also destroy any organisms that have the potential to cause disease. Depending on the source and composition of the wastewater, the digested solids are either sent to a landfill or used as fertilizer for crops. The use of the processed solid wastes as fertilizers is usually done only after careful testing for any potential dangerous contamination.

The treated water that is released by the plant is called effluent. The effluent is usually released into a local river or the ocean. In some places, this water may be used for landscaping (e.g. to water lawns or golf courses), but not for drinking purposes.

Located in the heart of Los Angeles, '''7th Street/Metro Center Station''' is one of four transfer stations in the system and one of 6 stations with a concurrency.  It is also one of 9 termini in the system.

7th Street/Metro Center is the gateway to many other lines.  If one is going downtown from another station on the Blue or Green Line, he/she will almost always make a stop at 7th Street/Metro Center, which could even be their destination.  Vice-versa, passengers going out of town in a southerly direction will most likely transfer at 7th Street/Metro Center.

==Station Basics==
[[File:Blue Line.jpg|thumb|alt=A Blue Line train enters 7th Street/Metro Center, its terminus.|A Blue Line train enters 7th Street/Metro Center, its terminus.]]

7th Street/Metro Center, located at 660 S Figueroa St, Los Angeles, CA 90017, is located in the heart of Downtown LA, making it, as its name suggests, the center of Metro services.  A transfer to the Metro Red/Purple Lines is available.  The station is found under the intersection of 7th and Flower.

==Floor Configuration==
[[File:LA Red Line.jpg|thumb|alt=A Red Line train bound for North Hollywood stops at 7th Street/Metro Center for passengers.|A Red Line train bound for North Hollywood stops at 7th Street/Metro Center for passengers.]]

! Level !! Features
|-
| Street || Entrance
|-
| B1 || Concourse (ticketing, gates); Blue Line platforms
|-
| B2 || Red/Purple Line platforms
|}

===B1===
After entering the station via one of the entrances around 7th Street, one reaches level B1, which hosts the concourse and Blue Line platforms.  Ticketing machines as well as the ticket barriers are located on this level.  The Blue Line platform is a side platform; this means that platform 1 and platform 2 are separated by the two tracks.  It is possible to go between tracks by going underground past the Red/Purple line platforms or by going over a pedestrian bridge.

===B2===
The Red and Purple Lines board at level B2.  Since the Red and Purple Lines share a [[Getting_around_Los_Angeles_by_Rail/Stops_and_Facilities/Metro_Rail_Transfer_Stations#Concurrencies|concurrency]], they share the same track.  Red Line trains to North Hollywood and Purple Line trains to Wilshire/Western board at the same track, and Red and Purple Line trains to Los Angeles Union Station board at the same track.  In the latter direction, since the concurrency extends to the terminus of both lines, it doesn't matter which train one takes.

==Lines Covered==
Three lines make a stop at 7th Street/Metro Center, one of which terminates there.

===Blue Line===
7th Street/Metro Center is the Blue Line's northern terminus.  It is also the only Blue Line station that is below-ground and one of 4 light-rail stations that are below-grade (the other three are Memorial Park - below-grade but not underground, Mariachi Plaza, and Soto - all on the Gold Line).  To the south, the Blue Line stops at Pico (STAPLES Center), 103rd Street (Watts Tower), Imperial/Wilmington (Green Line), and the Long Beach Loop (souther 'terminus')

===Red and Purple Lines===
The Red and Purple Line concurrency makes an intermediate stop at 7th Street/Metro Center.  Because of the concurrency, passengers bound for North Hollywood or Wilshire/Western board on the same platform.  Likewise, passengers for Los Angeles Union Station board on the other platform.  (Since the concurrency continues from 7th Street/Metro Center to the terminus, Los Angeles Union Station, if one is bound for Los Angeles Union Station, it doesn't matter which train he/she takes.)  The train makes additional stops at Pershing Square, Civic Center, and Union Station (Gold Line, Red/Purple terminus) to the west and Wilshire/Vermont, Wilshire/Western (Purple terminus), Hollywood/Highland (Red only), and North Hollywood (Red terminus) to the east.

:::&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''    922 USER GUIDE'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

== '''Introduction''' ==

Welcome to the Online User Guide for the Dish VIP 922.&lt;br&gt;
This Guide is made by and for users of the 922, and for those considering obtaining a 922 from Dish Network.&lt;br&gt;

The genesis of this guide is a desire expressed by many users that they would like to see an online guide that explains more about the 922 than what is currently available from Dish Network. Dish does have a few things that they offer. First, Dish has built into the 922 an online version of help files, available from Menu &gt; 6th icon on the right, top row - 'Help,' which contains a fair amount of information. Note that additional info is available by pressing the Red jump button. 

Second, Dish has built approx. 26 tips into the initial screensaver screen when the 922 is off. If you watch the screen, and press the forward, reverse, or fast-forward or fast-reverse buttons, you will see each tip, one at a time.

Third, Dish has [http://www.dishnetwork.com/tveverywhere/vip922/customer.aspx an online page] that contains some information about the 922, and all are recommended to read that page and several subpages, especially the 'More Info' sub-section. 

Fourth, there is the [http://www.dishnetwork.com/SupportSection/FileStream.ashx?ID=668 troubleshooting guide] that Dish delivers with the 922 itself. And then there is the ad hoc environments of the various online 922 user or support groups. All of these things are good. This effort is to draw together the best of what is available, and bring it all together in one updated online User Guide. &lt;br&gt;

This guide is coming along! It's currently under construction, and we welcome additional help in writing, formatting, editing, etc. You don't need any special permission. Just dig in! Thanks. You can look at how other things have been formatted, but don't worry about formatting if you don't 'get it'. If you put in the content, others will know how to format it. Correct, concise content is what is important right now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

== '''Installation''' ==

'''Preparing for tech arrival'''&lt;br&gt;
:You have ordered a 922 VIP from Dish Network, or are about to do so, and it is time to think about things regarding your installation. To be honest, TV plays a much more important role in most households than it should, but you are ordering a 922 in hopes that its capabilities will put you more in control. And it will. But you will be happier for a long time if you simply put some thought into your installation before the day of install. Once the technician arrives, he/she will be asking several questions of you, and you need to be ready with some steady and ready answers. This User Guide will seek to &quot;fill you in&quot; in the ins and outs of 922 installation. We will cover the installation of a brand new unit for a brand-new Dish household, and if there are additional considerations for those who are replacing or adding to their already-in-use Dish receivers or other DVRS, then those can be added at the bottom of this section.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

:It should be noted up front that, while Dish correctly identifies the hard drive in the VIP 922 as 1 Terabyte size, it does not really say the following additional and &lt;u&gt;important piece of information&lt;/u&gt;: You get 1/2 of the Terabyte for customer recordings, and Dish gets 1/2 of the Terabyte for its &quot;Instant VOD&quot; offerings, in case you want to take advantage of the movies that Dish will record from Satellite to DVR in the wee hours of the morning for per-movie fee. The theory Dish has is that many might want to take advantage of wanting fairly recent VOD offerings in High Def or 3D without having to wait for download times or without taking up internet bandwidth. This is the reason why you will see only 500MB available for your use. Many 922 users believe this is enough, but we highly recommend the purchase and USB-installation of at least a 1 Terabyte External Hard Drive (EHD) so you can offload your favorites, just in case you have a hardware failure of your 922, needing replacement. These EHD's are now fairly inexpensive, and we recommend you pick one up for less than $100. Make sure it is a DVR-compatible EHD.&lt;br&gt;

'''Homeowner install checklist'''&lt;br&gt;
:1. &lt;u&gt;Research and choose package carefully&lt;/u&gt; as to what level of Dish service, and what premium services you will want. You will be offered some free short term premium service(s).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:2. &lt;u&gt;Plan out a day for installation&lt;/u&gt;, about 2 weeks - 3 weeks out, where you or a knowledgeable adult would be able to be at home during the install. Give good directions to your home. First thing in the morning installs are most reliable for arrival time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:3. &lt;u&gt;Call up Dish to order.&lt;/u&gt; They do not currently or generally make the 922 available over their internet ordering tool. Some long-time well-paying customers will be able to obtain a &quot;free&quot; VIP 922, rather than pay the $200. fee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:4. &lt;u&gt;Make appointment, and be there 1 hour before&lt;/u&gt;, and be prepared to wait. Arrival will depend on how long the previous install required. Don't blame the tech for being held up by previous appointment or by the weather. It's not their fault.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:5. There will be &lt;u&gt;preferences and choices to make&lt;/u&gt; during the on-site installation process. Decide many of these things ahead of time, or be prepared to make quick decisions while the tech is there. Here are the basics:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::a. &lt;u&gt;Where do you want the outside dish to be located?&lt;/u&gt; (Have a preference, and then a couple of back-up locations, and be prepared to be flexible. There needs to be a clear view, free of trees. Some locations are tricky. Would you allow the dish to be on your roof? Attached to the side of your house? Attached to your deck? On a pole in your back yard? Front yard? If you are in an association, condo, or apartment, are there any rules about this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::b. &lt;u&gt;Where do you want the VIP 922 to be installed inside the house?&lt;/u&gt; Normally, you would want to choose your primary television-watching location, which is also likely your best High Definition HDMI television set. It is best to plan the location for the 922 unit, and to make sure it is a location that has plenty of air flow and &quot;breathing room&quot;, as it does give off some heat when it is in full operation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::c. &lt;u&gt;What are your TV2 locations/sets?&lt;/u&gt; You might have one, two, or more television sets in other room(s) that you want to feed over house coaxial cable from the TV2 coax output of your 922. In most cases, this works out well, due to most modern houses being equipped with a coax cable located in each main room. You will receive only one TV2 remote, however, no matter how many TV2 sets you intend to supply with the TV2 signal. You will have a choice of 16x9 output or 4x3 output.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::d. &lt;u&gt;Will your TV2 Remote connect and operate from the places you want to use it?&lt;/u&gt; Although in many homes, this is not a problem, there can be an issue with operating TV2 remote from the places in your home you intend to use it. Write up a list of locations and positions to test the full operation from the TV2 remote - and make sure you will go through the whole list with the installing technician &quot;in-tow&quot;, so they can see where there is a problem. In some far-reaching locations of the home, just pointing the TV2 remote up, or in a different angle, can result in successful remoting. Make sure you are doing page up and page down actions on the TV2 remote, as that tends to cause multiple, seemingly unstopping paginations - just on a single button press of page up or page down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:6.&lt;u&gt;Make sure you have Broadband Internet via Ethernet cable available to your intended 922 location.&lt;/u&gt; One of the distinguishing features of the 922 is that is it &quot;Sling-loaded&quot;, meaning that it is accessible over the web and over some mobile equipment apps. Therefore, it makes great sense to set-up as great an ethernet connection near the 922 installation location as possible. If you have direct-wire Cat 5 cable to the 922, that is best. But you can also use other methods as mentioned elsewhere in this guide. (See Sling section.) It works best to have an active internet connection ready-to-go on day of installation, with the maximum speeds for uploading and downloading  as you can afford, and as is locally available. For some, the Slinging is essential. For others, it is a nice-to-have. You will have to contemplate what place of importance you give this feature, and how much time, energy, and cost you want to expend to make this work best for you.
&lt;br&gt;

'''Day of installation'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:1.&lt;u&gt;Be there, ahead of time, for your appointment window.&lt;/u&gt; The installer could be running behind at a previous location, so you need to prepare for that - but the installer could also be running ahead of schedule, so we recommend making yourself available for at least an hour on either side of the appointment window.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:2.&lt;u&gt;Make sure an adult is present to meet the installer.&lt;/u&gt; The adult should be prepared with answers from the list above, and should be ready to make quick decisions to answer technician questions and recommendations for all of the installation parameters, such as location of dish, cable runs, location of 922 and TV1, and TV2 locations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:3.&lt;u&gt;Make a computer available, connected to the internet.&lt;/u&gt; Allow the technician to help check on the internet connection and Sling capabilities of the 922 at the end of installation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''Set-up'''&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;u&gt;Updates:&lt;/u&gt; (Settings &gt; Updates icon)
:You can set the time at which the VIP 922 updates once per day from Dish Network. This is the time at which the firmware, software, and guide updates will primarily occur. The default is likely 3 AM on your 922. You may want to set this at another time of your choosing. Preferably it is a time that you are LEAST likely to use the 922. The unit does not need to be &quot;on&quot; for either TV1 nor TV2 nor Remote use active, and in fact, if there are scheduled recordings during this time, the unit will delay the update.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;u&gt;TV2 Viewing: (Settings &gt; Shared View)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::The Shared Viewing feature is defaulted &quot;OFF&quot; on the 922. TV2 will have no picture or sound until you activate the Shared Viewing feature using the menus.  Settings &gt; Shared View &gt; On &gt; Save&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''Questions to ask of installer'''&lt;br&gt;
:1. Is my receiver you are installing brand-new, and never-before-used?
:2. Tell me about my Dish(es) and where they are pointed, and show me the strength of the signals from the various satellites. Which satellite is sending my local channels?
:3. Have you used some clear-caulk to fill-in around any holes you made into the house? 
:4. If any roof installation was required, have you sealed-off any potential holes made in the roof, from any weather conditions?
:5. Have you set up my TV2 the way I need it, to all of the TV2 sets I have in mind? Will the TV2 remote work from all of those locations?
:6. Did you leave me the box and all of the materials that came with the receiver(s), in case I need to ever return any malfunctioning receiver?
:7. Can you help me set up some of the features, and make sure I can connect to the 922 with Dish Online and Dish Remote Access?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

== '''Features and Functions''' ==

:'''Channel Lists'''&lt;br&gt;
::There are 4 custom channel lists that can be constructed for a user - accessible on both TV1 and TV2 outputs, regardless of whether in Duo or Single/PIP mode. To construct a list, one would press &quot;Guide&quot; button repeatedly until the &quot;Edit Lists&quot; selection is highlighted. Then choose the &quot;Select&quot; button on the remote. Arrow down, then arrow to the right until reaching the list you want to customize. Pressing Select will produce two choices: &quot;Edit Channels&quot; and &quot;Edit Name&quot;. Recommend that you set a name first, and then you can select channels that apply to the category or person for which you name the list. Note here: Free Preview channels currently on Dish Network can be viewed and added to a Channel List, but when the preview ends, there is currently a bug where you cannot remove a channel that you no longer are subscribed to see. Therefore, either make sure you are always scrubbing the exiting Preview channels before the end of the month, or, as some folks do, name one of your Channel Lists a &quot;Preview&quot; list, and only put Preview Channels on that one - and perhaps you won't care as much when the preview is over, and you are left with a red channel number and a message that you aren't a subscriber.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:'''Channel selection'''&lt;br&gt;
::To select a channel, you have several options:
:::# Direct-tune any channel with the channel number on the remote's number pad
:::# Hit the Guide button (multiple times to your desired Channel List) and us page up / page down, or channel up / channel down, and then Select
:::# Use the Green button to select a &quot;favorite&quot; Quick Clicks channel (provided you have set some up on that screen
:::# Right-arrow to instigate the browse feature - to which you can arrow up and down, and Select a channel you desire
:::# Use the 'Recall' button on the remote to go back to the channel you were watching before your current selection
:::# Use the &quot;Input&quot; button or the &quot;Swap&quot; button on the remote to change to the current channel on the other tuner (provided you are operating in Single/PIP mode.)

Categories could include links to these online tools, as well as functions, what to expect, and how to best set-up for network and remote use, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

DO (Dish Online) and DRA (Dish Remote Access) are the web tools and apps by which the 922 Slinging capability is accessed. At this point, Dish Network and Sling have determined NOT to offer a Direct Sling client application. Although the Menu &gt; Menu will show you the Sling Finder ID and Sling Password number, there is no currently offered client that can utilize that information. We should also stipulate up-front that many users have found the Sling capabilities to present some difficulties. We have asked one of the forum experts to offer some instruction here, and hopefully that can happen in the near future in this Wikibook user guide.

== '''Tips &amp; Tricks''' ==
Need contributors to list information here. Add any tips and tricks that do not seem to fit in other categories.&lt;br&gt;

:1. &lt;u&gt;Recording a Clip&lt;/u&gt;:  If you want to save a little small clip - something that you just watched on Live TV, say it's a song or a funny skit or memorable news item, you can still record it as a clip (as long as you don't change the channel.) Just use your reverse key to go backwards into the buffer, back to just before where you want to begin the clip. Press Play. Then, at the moment where you want the Clip to start, press the red-dot Record button (just below the pause button on the remote.) If the entire contents of your clip are already in the buffer, then immediately proceed to Press the white-square Stop button (to the left of the Record button,) and confirm you want to stop the recording. You will have your clip. If you want, you could also fast-forward to Live TV, and watch until the moment where you want to then Stop the Clip. Note that It does not work to stop at another point in the buffer (wish it did) but the clip will contain everything from the moment of the Record button mark up to the current Live TV moment in the buffer. This is a neat trick if you don't want a whole program (or didn't record the program,) but wish you had a clip of what you just watched! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

:2. &lt;u&gt;Ultimate Favorite&lt;/u&gt;:  If you want to set-up an 'ultimate favorite' channel - something that you want to be able to quickly get to at any point, then you can set-up the Quick Clicks (Green button) to have your ultimate favorite channel in the bottom left-hand rectangle. This will require that you at least have the first column set up with channels, because the channels are placed on Quick Clicks in a pattern of down first column, then down second column, then third. Once this is set-up, if you are on a channel and want to have a quick change to your ultimate favorite, you could press, in order: Green &gt; Red &gt; Select. (You can also just remember the channel number, and type the numbers into the remote keypad. Remembering your favorite channel numbers is actually the best direct-tuning-method until Dish reorganizes the way Quick Clicks works.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

:3. &lt;u&gt;Saving the Internal Hard Drive Recordings on Partially working 922&lt;/u&gt;:  If you have a 922 that is &quot;mostly dead&quot;, but lives for a short time before failing, but not long enough to transfer your recordings to an EHD (External Hard Drive) - then you might try disconnecting the satellite feed cable(s) to the 922. In this way, it should prevent the unit from trying to connect with the Satellites, giving you more time to transfer one program at a time to an EHD, before the unit dies completely, and before it is replaced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

:4. &lt;u&gt;Keep track of Dish Free Previews, and eliminate the free channels from your channel lists before a preview ends.&lt;/u&gt; Dish Perks and Dish Free Previews, which are linked toward the beginning of this Wikibook, clearly spell out which channels are being offered free, and which package (and above) they normally are found. Do not let a free channel stay on your channel lists beyond the free preview, *unless* you are already part of the allowed packages, or will sign-up for an allowed package, as an expired non-subscribed channel will appear RED on your channel list, and due to a current bug, will not be removeable as long as you are not subscribed, or until the next free preview of that channel.

== '''Bleeding Edge &amp; Trouble-Shooting''' ==
&lt;br&gt;
Need contributors to list information here. This section is reserved for &quot;bugs&quot; and &quot;operational edginess&quot; about which users commonly share some frustration.

'''TROUBLESHOOTING'''

&lt;b&gt;New User Advice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;u&gt;First 48 hours&lt;/u&gt;. There are many who do experience issues with their 922, and this is especially true when the unit is new to a household and user.If you are a new to a 922, or new to a replacement 922, you need to know that there are a number of item downloads which will occur from Dish Network over the first 24 to 48 hours. Do NOT panic if the box is less than 2 days old / 2 days connected. These satellite downloads will occur to give your box the various items it needs to operate properly. If you don't see all of the guide or icons or even hard drive size at first, don't worry. &lt;b&gt;New users, Check back on it after the 24 to 48 hour time period.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;u&gt;Essential EHD&lt;/u&gt;. USB External Hard Drives are very inexpensive, even for a 1 or 2 Terabyte unit. Get one, and make sure you are archiving / transferring your most important recordings over to the EHD from the 922. This will ensure that you do not lose your most favored recordings if your 922 has a major hardware, firmware, or software issue that is unresolvable, requiring a replacement. Don't wait until 'some day', which is usually the day after you lost your internal hard drive recordings. Order one now, and get it plugged-in, and use it at least once per week to archive your favorite recordings, and you will thank yourself for spending the extra cash, and you will also find the &quot;pressure is off&quot; when it comes to hard drive space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''First things to check...'''&lt;br&gt;
One should not necessarily always blame the 922. While the box itself may be the cause of problems, it is important to first do everything you can to remedy any issues that are outside the box, such as the three types of supply to the 922....&lt;br&gt;

:1. &lt;u&gt;Electrical&lt;/u&gt;. Make sure your electrical AC power, where you are plugging the 922 power cable, is providing clean AC power that is properly grounded. Possibly in your situation, you could temporarily move the unit to another location, or temporarily connect a long 3-prong extension cable in order to connect the 922 to another &quot;zone&quot; of the household current, if you are having problems that are suspiciously caused by electrical 'upsets.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:2. &lt;u&gt;Satellite&lt;/u&gt;. Make sure you have a grounding block properly installed on your satellite feed, and beyond that, to ensure that other than the grounding block, you have a straight, clean, non-spliced coax cable without any extra couplings, where interference of some kind could be causing problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:3. &lt;u&gt;Internet&lt;/u&gt;. Make sure you have good internet connection. The best, of course, is a direct Cat5 ethernet cable directly from the household Cable or DSL modem to the back of the 922. Second best would be to use a [http://www.slingbox.com/go/slt Dish AC Powerline Ethernet Sling link] at the modem, because the 922 was built to communicate directly with that over its own AC power connection - however, do not introduce any surge protector or other device that might interfere with the Sling link signaling that is sent over an unused frequency on the household AC current. Another manufacturer's powerline ethernet system would work, as long at connected to the ethernet port of the 922. Third best is wireless bridge, but you are entering into increasing problems with wireless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Beyond these incoming connections, it makes sense to work with the 922 hardware itself...&lt;br&gt;
:4. &lt;u&gt;Soft Reset&lt;/u&gt;. After checking and ensuring your best incoming power and signaling, the next troubleshooting step to take is a soft reset. You can do this on the 922's front panel. On the left side is a black door that swings open and to the left. Simply use your thumb and fore finger to hold the top and bottom of the 922's front panel, approximately 3 to 4 inches from the left, and pull open gently. Inside you will see a small red reset button. Press this, and the unit will soft-reset. Many issues are eliminated with a soft reset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:5. &lt;u&gt;Hard Reset&lt;/u&gt;. After attempting a soft reset, you can try a hard reset. This involves temporarily interrupting the AC power to the unit. Disconnect the AC power cable from the three-prong AC home outlet. Leave the machine unplugged to power for at least 1 minute. Plug the unit back to AC power. The 922 will then perform a hard reset, which will look similar on-screen to the soft reset, although Dish Support assures this will reset more features and functions than the soft reset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:6. &lt;u&gt;System Wizard&lt;/u&gt;. If you hold down on the &quot;0&quot; number key for 3 seconds, you will enter the System Wizard screen. This will allow you to choose either Backup or Restore.  Read the message below the Last Backup Date, and perform Backups and Restores, as needed. Read the messages carefully when restoring. It doesn't operate with the logic you may think, but it is a brilliant and distinguishing feature for Dish Network 922's. If you DO have to ever replace the 922, you will likely be able to use information stored on your remote to replenish channel list and timer information to the new replacement unit, even if your existing 922 receiver is inoperable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:7. &lt;u&gt;Dish Troubleshooting Codes&lt;/u&gt;. If you see any 3-digit codes appear from your Dish GUI (Graphic User Interface) on the 922, you can look these up in the manual that should have been given to you by the installer (or inside your box,) or you can look them up [http://www.dishnetwork.com/SupportSection/FileStream.ashx?ID=668 here in the online version of Dish error codes].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:8. &lt;u&gt;Cabinet Overheating?&lt;/u&gt;. There should be some attention paid to air flow around the 922 box, and making sure that it is not in an air-tight cabinet where it could experience overheating. The box runs fairly warm, and if it is in an enclosed space, it might be subject to higher temperatures than what it should have inside the box. Make sure there is at least 3 inches of open space surrounding the unit's top and sides, in addition to ensuring good air flow. Some suspect overheating is related to a symptom of extra high-fan noise. Make sure the unit is sitting flat on all four of its feet, and that there is adequate air flow around the unit. You can get some Hard Disc Drive temperature diagnostics by going to Yellow button &gt; down 4 icons &gt; Diagnostics &gt; Right arrow &gt; Page Down button several times to near the bottom. You can see:&lt;br&gt;
:::HDD High Temp
:::HDD Low Temp
:::HDD Average Temp&lt;br&gt;
:::An average temperature of the Hard Disc Drive could be around 110-115&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;F and be thought of as normal. If the hard disk drive reaches a temp of 140&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;F, then a warning message will appear to indicate the unit will soon shut down, due to reaching the maximum temperature allowed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:9. &lt;u&gt;TV2 Remote troubles&lt;/u&gt;. We'll mention it here, but troubles with the TV2 remote have more to do with the installation and location of the main 922 unit and antenna situation vís a vís the remote 2 handset, and the direction it is pointing. Further tips may be available under Setup on Installation. But you need to realize that the software works fine for Remote 2, and it usually is that the UHF signal between remote 2 and the 922 antenna can be weak, and that will cause some paginations that don't seem to quit, or some delayed or non-responsiveness to button presses. If you move to another room closer to the 922 / antenna, check to see if that solves your problem, which will confirm signal strength to the antenna. Sometimes just pointing the remote in a different direction in your room, or changing the angle of the antenna, will improve your remote 2 capability.
&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;u&gt;Hard Drive Transplant&lt;/u&gt;. In my experience these DVR's always run very warm and have poor airflow. I get about 1 year on a ViP922. Symptoms start up then eventually your box is frozen. If it's already too late- your recorded shows are locked on a dead 922 - and you did not transfer everything before it froze - all is not lost if you lease your ViP922 from Dish Network. Your shows could be in tact on the old internal hard drive. Follow Dish tech support and obtain a replacement 922. This will take a week. When it arrives, hold your old one for another day for surgery. Connect the replacement 922 to SAT, A/V and power, allow it to download and start working normally. Authorize your new 922 via phone, chat or login to your Dish account. Make sure they authorize your new box for the external hard drive option, and if you have an over the air tuner card, transfer that from your old 922, and install that. Check that your new ViP922 is working ok, all your channels, you can see your optional external hard drive in the browse feature of the DVR. Then put both 922's on the bench. With no A/C power connected - from the old 922, pull the internal hard drive and set it aside. To do this remove 4, back cover screws (black,) then slide the cover back about 1/2 inch and tilt upwards to remove. Then remove three internal hard drive brace supports screws (chrome)- two are on the back of the unit, one is on the right side near the fan. Disconnect hard drive power and data connections. Lift support brace upwards, just enough to unbolt the hard drive from the four rubber shock mounted screws and remove the old hard drive. There are probably further details on the web. Next, with A/C power disconnected, remove the new 922 cover to expose the support brace for it's internal hard drive. Disconnect the red SATA data cable and power cable. Place a non-conductive pad over the hard drive brace (cloth kitchen pot holder etc) and set your old hard drive on top with the power and data connections near the cables. Fish the short cables through the support brace and connect your old hard drive with the power and data lines. With your new 922 connected via SAT, A/V connections, also your external hard drive via USB power up the DVR and allow approx 5-8 minutes for it to boot up. It should now show your old hard drive and it's shows. Also all your timers. Begin the media transfer to your external hard drive of the shows you want. If you need more space, you can have several external hard drives, the DVR doesn't care. Just up plug the hard drive (after all data has writing/reading has ceased) - you will see an alert that says USB device disconnected. Click ok. Then connect your second external hard drive and and continue your media transfer. While transferring, take the time to note your timers with pencil/paper. Might help when you need to reprogram 150 timers. Once done, your can reverse the transplant process, putting the old hard drive back into your old 922 so you can ship it back. I also mark my DVR's with drafting tape and write OLD and NEW on covers chassis and hard drives so I don't get them mixed up on the bench.

== '''KNOWN BUGS in Current Software Version S1.15''' ==
&lt;br&gt;
There are several known bugs in the current version of software, most of which have been reported to Dish already. It is helpful to know what they are. We are hoping many of these will be resolved in the next software release.&lt;br&gt;
1/20/2012 - New Software Version S1.16 was released. It is being evaluated as to how many of these bugs below were fixed.

:1. &lt;u&gt;Inability to delete Channels no longer subscribed from oneʼs custom channel guide lists&lt;/u&gt;: When a subscriber has channels, either because they are part of a package, or because they are offered for free preview, they can select those channels on one of their custom guides. However, when the channel is lost, either due to a package change, or the loss of a free preview, that channel name is listed in RED font in the actual Guide, and not-usable, but on editing the channels for that custom Guide, the channel is not listed for the user to un-select, and it is impossible to get the unsubscribed channel off of oneʼs custom channel list.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:2. &lt;u&gt;Overnight Update refresh causes loss of currently selected Guide and reverts to default ʻMy Channelsʼ guide&lt;/u&gt;: The Daily Update refresh, usually selected by the user to be sometime overnight, causes the loss of the current selected Guide, and the Guide reverts to the default of ʻMy Channelsʼ (all the channels to which you are subscribed at Dish,) which most users do not want. Most users have a main custom guide that they consistently use, and they desire the guide to continue as the selected guide, even after the Daily Update.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:3. &lt;u&gt;On selection of new Guide - GUI insists you select and then always arrow-down to guide channels&lt;/u&gt;: For those users that do change channel guides from one guide to another, whether that be to a 922 standard guide, or to a custom channel list, once the user has selected a guide, the selector stays on the selector instead of moving to the guide channel listing. Current functionality requires the user to arrow-down each time they change the Guide Selector, to the top row of the channel listings, in order to use that guide. This is highly annoying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:4. &lt;u&gt;Pause - never able to see the screen paused without Dish 922 on-top graphics&lt;/u&gt;: Pausing a screen (with pause button) does not ever allow the user to see the paused action without Dish graphics on top. In other words, sometimes when a user pauses, they want to see the screen content in its entirety. It is not just because they left the room for a few minutes. They are interested in the paused content. But Dish has not given that option, and the Pause will bring up the timeline and Pause Icon, and those will not go away until the pause or play buttons are pressed. The only other option for the user is to press the Cancel button, which temporarily will show the Top Banner guide information instead of the timeline. This reverts to the timeline after 5 seconds. But at no time is one allowed to see a paused screen without Dish information on top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:5. &lt;u&gt;Incorrect Episode #ʼs in guide&lt;/u&gt;: Episode Numbers in the Guide information are incorrect, sometimes even in Season 1 of a series, and almost always incorrect in the later seasons of a TV Series. We believe this is caused by a deficient code translation of the Tribune Media guide information feed. The feed is likely supplying Season and Episode information, and Dish likely has a code-translation to a Total Episode #, which often fails, giving erroneous Episode numbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:6. &lt;u&gt;Slinging instability&lt;/u&gt;: Ever since the introduction of Dish Online and the near-shut-down of Dish Remote Access, the Dish Slinging from the VIP 922 has been unstable, and works well sometimes, but not other times. Some users complain that the level of instability has increased, and that before Dish Online, there was a much higher stability with the slinging. In addition, there is no direct client offered currently for the slinging, and unless one is on a PC and has an older version of the Desktop sling software, one must use either Dish Online or Dish Remote Access. [This is an area that &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; have been improved in S116, but that is difficult to know or find any documentation. Certainly the Dish Remote Access is again on the decline, and Dish's recent approach to that site seems to indicate it is on its &quot;last legs.&quot;]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:7. &lt;U&gt;Manual and Dish Pass Timers NOT onboard the 922, but only via remote access&lt;/u&gt;: Users of other Dish models make repeated pleas to introduce Manual and Dish Pass recording timer set-ups to the Dish 922 itself. They are not currently onboard in the current software. You have access to Manual timers in both Dish Online and Dish Remote Access, and you also have access to a Dish Pass timer in Dish Remote Access. [Dish Pass, even on DRA has been found to not work at all, so Dish Pass, or the ability to record anything with a certain word or phrase in the title, or certain name of an actor, etc., is not possible on the 922.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:8. &lt;u&gt;Wrong percentages on Internal Hard Drive&lt;/u&gt;: Occasionally, some users, especially in the first month of installation, can see a wrong percentage concerning Internal Hard Drive space used. Sometimes the percentage is wildly impossible, such as 200%+. This does not impact performance, and falls into an annoyance, but is often corrected after a month or two of normal use. Suggestion is to simply save more things to your internal hard drive, and occasionally check for correct estimated percentage. The Dish Online and Dish Remote Access online tools can help to get a better percentage. Dish Remote Access also attempts to estimate the number of HD and SD hours still available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:9. &lt;u&gt;EHD not available Online or on TV2 in Duo Mode&lt;/u&gt;: External Hard Disk Recordings are accessible via the 922 TV1 (and Solo mode mirror to TV2,) but the drop-down does not occur via slinging (online or local LAN) and not available on TV2 if you have the 922 in Duo mode. They *are* available on TV2 if you have Solo/PIP mode selected. It is easy to change from one mode to the other via Settings (Yellow button) &gt; 2 icons down &gt; 2 icons right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:10. &lt;u&gt;Daily Schedule temporary Timer loss&lt;/u&gt;: There appears to be a newer issue in Nov/Dec of 2011, where users have noticed that there is a sudden loss or disruption of the Daily Schedule. When this happens, the timer items may say &quot;No information available&quot; and when highlighted, will actually contain some information to the right side of the Daily Schedule screen. But these kinds of timers will not record. Some have found that the timers can be just a temporary loss, and while nothing can be done about the one day's timer events, the rest of events appear normal the next day, having done nothing. [This appears to be related to the number of Timer events possible on the 922, and when the number of events is exceeded (even skipped events,) the Daily Schedule can experience a temporary memory loss.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:11. &lt;u&gt;Browse Feature's reverse up/down logic&lt;/u&gt;: The Browse feature (right arrow) takes you to an channel &amp; page up/down world that is opposite of the up/down world that the Guide Channel Lists have. The opposite logic is somewhat confusing. To explain Dish's thinking, they determined on the Channel Lists, you should have up mean you are going up the list, and down going down the list. However, on the Browse feature, up means up in Channel number, and down means the direction of lower channel numbers. [Upon further examination, it appears that if the Guide Display Setting is &quot;Ascending&quot;, it causes this problem. If set to &quot;Descending&quot;, the browse and guide operate the same way. So bug here would be that the choice of &quot;Ascending&quot; should also be matched by 'Browse' feature, but it is not.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:12. &lt;u&gt;Slo-mo back-jump&lt;/u&gt;: The slow motion (press pause, then use the back/forth arrows to control,) works fairly well until one wants to go back and forth over a certain point in the recording. You might proceed to the spot where you wanted to review in slo-mo, so you then pause, and then start forward at 1/15 or 1/4 speed. You see the spot you want to see, and now you want to review it again. You pause, and then go backwards, only to find you have suddenly jumped to a much earlier spot in the recording.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== '''Blockbuster Movie Pass''' ==
This section is reserved for Blockbuster Movie Pass, which is not currently available on the VIP 922, nor on the current software release S1.15.&lt;br&gt;
The most recent 922 forum indications from 922 users is not to expect the S1.16 release with BBMP (Blockbuster Movie Pass) until January 2012.

      <comment>/* Standard variable names */ formatting/grammatical fixes</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In general, standard names make it easy to reuse code (CRFs and rules) from project to project, and if you know the conventions, they make the projects easier to understand.

== Standard variable names ==

Frequently used CRFs (Concomitant Medications, Adverse Events, Medical History etc.) in particular should use short, standard variable names (CDISC is a good source for example names).

CDISC has a set of standard variable names and fragments that should be used where possible. See CDASH (http://www.cdisc.org/cdash) and SDTM (http://www.cdisc.org/sdtm), also see section 10.3.1 ‘Standardised and Reserved codes’ in the SDTM3.1.1ImplementationGuide.pdf (http://www.cdisc.org/content1605).  All variable names should be prefixed with fragments that indicate the domain that the variable is from (e.g. VS is Vital Signs).

#Standard Code Lists - define and reuse standard codelists (RESPONSE_TYPE, RESPONSE_LABEL,RESPONSE_VALUES_OR_CALCULATIONS groups) to simplify the work of those extracting data.
#Standard Rule xmls - define standard rules for frequently used CRFs (e.g. use short codes for trials to avoid conflicts with other co-hosted trials, see  [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/CRFandOIDissues|Avoiding problems with OIDs]]).

If a repeating set of questions is developed as a separate CRF, the developer can just create and test that section as a CRF once.  This is made easier if the developer has input into the development of the original CRF, and can try to standardise the look of repeating sections, which can be later developed as one OpenClinica CRF.

=== Defining Item_names to avoid problems when exporting to SAS and other formats (field lengths) ===

If a CRF's data will be exported for SAS, then the Item_names should be no more than 32 characters long to avoid import errors.  For SAS programmers that will receive our data, shorter is better - because when writing code in SAS, there's no autocomplete.

When exporting to formats other than XML, avoid underscores in field and CRF names, as OpenClinica’s export inserts underscores to delimit CRFs and groups, and extra underscores make it difficult to automatically identify these delimiters and identify CRF, group and field names.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Sociology and Development &lt;ref name=&quot;Barnett&quot;&gt;Barnett, Tony (1988) Sociology and Development, Hutchison&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Laite&quot;&gt;Laite, Julian (1988) Chapter 5 ''The sociology of development'' in Leeson, P.F.; Minogue, M.M., eds (1988). Perspectives on Development: Cross-disciplinary themes in development. Manchester University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ===

== Introduction ==
Sociology has been described, by Durkheim, as the study of ''social facts''. &lt;ref name=&quot;durk&quot;&gt;Durkheim, E. (1893) ''The rules of the Sociological Method'', The Free Press, New York, 1964 pp. 1–3, first published in French in 1893, in English, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim argued that
''…that group of phenomena which may be differentiated from those studied by the other natural sciences. When I fulfil my obligations as brother, husband or citizen, when I execute my contracts, I perform duties which are defined, externally to myself and my acts, in laws and in custom. Even if they conform to my own sentiments and I feel their reality subjectively, such reality is still objective, for I did not create them; I merely inherited them through my education…. Here, then, is a category of facts with very distinctive characteristics: it consists of ways of acting, thinking and feeling, external to the individual, and endowed with a power of coercion, by reason of which they control him.''(pp. 1–3.)

Durkheim is stressing what might be described as the studying of the otherness of societies.
That is he was looking at the constraints and limitations on individual hopes and desires. In effect he was examining the way societies attempt to achieve a degree of order. To behave in a regular fashion in accorance with some generally agreed upon set of rules of behaviour. What is particularly important in times of social, economic and culturalchange, is to find out how to establish a moral community.

== Origins of Sociology ==
R_U shifts
== Meanings of Development ==
Barnett identifies the three meanings and three problem areas. The three meanings  are ''Development from within'', ''Development as interaction'' and ''Development as interpenetration'' and three problem areas are ''the Social, the Cultural and the Political''.

Let us look at each of Barnett's three meanings in turn:
# ''Development from within'': In this meaning objects — be they a plant or animal, or a whole society — have a tendency to change their forms. When looking at societies this is amounts to assuming that such changes and its direction is the result of that occur inside the society.
# ''Development as interaction'': In this meaning development that arises because of the interaction of an object with its wider environment. This invovles understanding a combination of not only of the inner qualities and potentials but also the opportunities and resources available within the wider environment.
# ''Development as interpenetration'': In this meaning it is difficult to distinguish between an object and its wider environment. For a society what are its boudaries?  The example Barnett uses here is to ask how one can distinguish between Egyptian society and its ''environment'' which might contain the rest of the islamic world. The wider islamic world's ideas, peoples and concerns affecting what happens in Egypt.

== Disciplines == 

It is important to stress the interrelatedness of different ''disciplines'' relevant to development. Although the may - superficially seem easily separable, the speration of the social sciences into sociology, anthropology, economics, economic history, history, geography, has been a choice. It is quite possible that this separation can be a problem for thinking in general but in particular in development.  It is possible for example to make us think that we have covered all the bases when addressing a particular issue when really we have ignored many things that might have helped our analysis if we had had a wider disciplinary scope.

=== Weber and Development ===
A key concern for Weber (1864-1924) was understanding the origins of capitalism. His best work is ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''. In this work he states that the development of capitalism can best be understood in terms of changes in the way some sections of socitey began to think and position themselves in the world. For Weber Capitalism was defined as an economic and social system built upon individual endeavour. Private indiduals with sufficient resources, capital, to invest, produce goods by employing other people and then sell these goods on a market. Profits from these activities may then be reinvested to increase the scale of activity or added to wealth. The key innovative features of such a society are the commodity and the market. Most things can be bought and sold. 

== Weber’s idea of ''rationalisation'' ==

Weber’s ''rationalisation'' involves the use of ''calculation'' and ''planning'' in adddressing all aspects of social behaviour. An example might help.
Imagine two businessmen. The first keeps his household and his business affairs all mixed up and relies on his memory for stock control and accounting.  A second treats his business more rationally. He expanded his business, installing computerised till and accounts with a formal set of profit and loss accounts, mointoring of stock, and ful detailling of wage and input costs. This information system is designed and used to help effciently achieve a profit—maximisng goal.

== Laite ==
The models: capitalism, statism and agrarian socialism 
Economic development 
The rural sector 
Migration 
Industrialisation and working class formation 
Urbanisation 
Conclusion: perspectives on development

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Writing a fact sheet tutorial==

A fact sheet is typically an important, at-a-glance tool used in public relations to provide an overview of a large issue.  Fact sheets can stand alone, but commonly supplement a news release, a chapter of a book, or replace a brochure. The point of a fact sheet is to get the reader to do something. More information than you need to convince them is a waste of the reader's time and risks losing their attention. Make it as easy as possible for them to take action.

===Fact sheet elements===

A fact sheet is generally one or two pages and includes “the who, what, when, where,  why and how” about a chapter or event. Here are some tips on creating a fact sheet.
::* One page is best 
::* Make it readable 
::* Keep the text brief - no one wants to read tons of information in a small font 
::* Keep the most important information in the first paragraph - what the issue is, what action is needed, and label the main message(s) 
::* Give references for more information - in electronic communications you can offer links 
::* The fact sheet must be self-contained - do not refer to previous documents or assume that the reader remembers the information 
::* Use bullets when you can 
::* Leave lots of white space 
::* Make it very clear what you want the reader to do - bold type face, text boxes, and graphics add emphasis 
::* Give the reader all the tools he/she may need to take action

===Tutorial Steps===

# In groups of two discuss potential options for a fact sheet topic.
# Find a majority view on what type of information would be useful for this fact sheet.
# Determine what related information would be too much or not suitable to the fact sheet.
# Discuss ideas on what visual aids could assist in the fact sheet.
# Discuss what kinds of information people may want to know more about, but for which you don't have enough space on the fact sheet. How can you point the reader towards this further information?

Note that some of these points discussed above relate to style. For the purposes of this exercise, we ask you to only sytlise within the wiki (which is quite limited).


Here are some examples of health related fact sheets
:*[http://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/docs/ExerciseandDepression.pdf Black Dog Institute - Exercise and Depression (PDF).] Note that the topic is broad and consequently too long for this assessment item, but the coverage in the sections is a good start.
:*[http://www.sads.org/images/stories/pdf/Exercise.pdf Sudden Death and exercise (PDF)] is a one page SADS fact sheet, but I don’t think it covers the sections outline above and appears to only make recommendations without a background.
:*[http://sma.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Diabetes-and-exercise-fact-sheetFINAL2010.pdf Sports Medicine Australia, diabetes and exercise fact sheet (PDF).] Similar to the depression fact sheet above, this covers sections well but is too broad in its approach for this assessment.
:*[http://www.bhfactive.org.uk/userfiles/Documents/factsheetchildren.pdf British Health Service, exercise recommendations for children (PDF).] covers recommendations very well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Getting started on this wiki - Technical tutorial==

MediaWiki - is software that allows many commonly used online wikis to work. Different programs work in slightly different ways, learning how MediaWiki works will enable you to work on many different websites and is recognised as a format which will allow you to work  in other formats with ease. Common MediaWiki sites include: Wikipedia, Wikiversity and WikiBooks. You will use Wikibooks for your assignment.&lt;/br&gt;

Objective
* To get you familiar, comfortable and experimenting with the technical skills of a media wiki.

===Register for account===

::* Go to wikibooks.org and register for an account (top right of screen). You may choose to log-in with an existing log-in if you already have one). Wikibooks has a help section for [[Using_Wikibooks/Setting_Up_A_User_Account|setting up a user account]]

====Notes on usernames====

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTzUwXaAK2s Video: Wikimedia foundation - Username]

Think carefully about your username. There are both potential negatives and positives to using a username that can be linked to your person. Do you want (or not want) to be linked to the work you are doing? Particularly poor or offensive work may not help you in the future, but good work can help. You can’t change the username associated with work written in the past.

Email your name and username (once registration completed) to the unit convenor.

===Edit your profile===

Once completed click on your username (the link will be red - red denotes that there is no content behind that link). You are now in a space which relates to your username profile, it is here we will practice editing a MediaWiki before moving on to your fact sheet.

::* Click edit

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25hWh1Pa44M Video: Wikimedia foundation - Edit]

Here we have set a number of tasks to help you get used to working in the wiki.

Resources to get you started
:*Wikibooks help section on [[Help:Editing|how to edit a page]]
:* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7yXx3YbcNI Youtube - Howcast - how to: quick overview of Wikipedia editing]

# Introduce yourself - write a couple of sentences about yourself. Click save and view it.
# Click back on the edit button, and create the following section headings:
:# Background
:# Interests
:# Wikibooks projects
# Save and make sure you have subheadings present.
# Click on edit and add information to each section. - add the Exercise in Disease site to your profile, you will add detail of your particular fact sheet once it has started
# In the top section, add an image of yourself.

===History===

Now have a look at the page you have created. Now click on “history”. Have a look at the different edit history. The wiki will save all your work so you can always go back to previous versions. This can come in handy if you make a major mistake or if there vandalism to your site.

===Evidence Base===

As with all evidence-based writing, you need to add sources/references to your claims. Have a quick look at the short video:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa0Nmv9qsd8 Youtube - Wikimedia Foundation - Verifiability]

In the work you have completed so far about yourself, find (or add something] that you can support with external evidence. Use the reference tool in the wiki to add the evidence. Save and check out the format. You may need to play around with the format until it makes some logical sense.

[[File:Blender 2.5 Screenshot.jpg|250px|thumb|Screen shot of the Blender 2.5 user interface. The large window is a '''3D View''' with an opened '''Tool Shelf'''. Above it is a small '''Info window'''. In the bottom, right corner is a '''Properties window'''. The type of each window can be changed with the icon in its bottom left or top left corner.]]
This tutorial covers the basic steps to create a minimal GLSL shader in Blender 2.6. 

===Creating a GLSL Shader===
The steps to specify and run a GLSL vertex and fragment shader are, for example:
* First, start Blender:
** Under Windows, start Blender like any other application. Then click in an '''Info window''' (by default the top-most line): '''Window &gt; Toggle System Console''' in order to see error messages. 
** Under GNU/Linux, start it from a console or terminal, such that you can see error messages. For example, click on '''Applications &gt; Accessories &gt; Terminal''', then type &lt;code&gt;blender&lt;/code&gt; and press Return.
** Under MacOS X, start Blender by right-clicking the application package and select '''Show Package Contents'''. Then go to '''Contents &gt; MacOS''' and start the blender executable there in order to see error messages.
* In the '''Text Editor''' (click the icon in the bottom left or top left corner of any Blender window to change its type), choose '''Text &gt; Create Text Block''', copy the Python script from below, and give it a name.
* In the '''Info window''', click '''Add &gt; Mesh &gt; Cube''' (or another mesh, or use the default cube). 
* In the '''3D View''', select the mesh by right-clicking it.
* For some meshes it makes sense to use smooth shading: in the '''3D View''' choose '''View &gt; Tool Shelf''' from the menu (or press '''t''') and click on '''Object Tools &gt; Shading &gt; Smooth'''.
* For some GLSL shaders it is necessary to set '''Viewport shading''' to '''Textured''': in the '''3D View''' select '''Textured''' in the widget next but one to the right of the menu. 
* For some GLSL shaders it is necessary to activate '''GLSL shading''': in the '''3D View''' choose '''View &gt; Properties'''  from the menu (or press '''n''') and choose '''Display &gt; Shading &gt; GLSL'''. 
* In the '''Logic Editor''' (with the mesh still being selected), click '''Add Sensor &gt; Always''' and give it a name.
* In the '''Logic Editor''', click '''Add Controller &gt; Python''', give it a name, and set the '''Script''' to the name of the Python script that you chose in the Text Editor.
* In the '''Logic Editor''', connect the sensor to the controller by dragging and dropping a connection from the small disk to the right of the sensor to the small disk to the left of the controller.
* In the '''3D View''', press '''p''' (for “play”) to start the game engine and see the effect of the shader, which should render the object in full red. &lt;br/&gt; Alternatively, you could also go to the '''Info window''' and choose “Blender Game” (instead of “Blender Render”) as engine; and then go to the '''Properties window''', select the '''Render tab''' (the camera icon) and click the '''Start''' button under '''Embedded Player'''.
* If the GLSL program didn't compile or link, error messages are printed to the console.
* Press '''Esc''' to stop the game engine.
* Be happy about your first GLSL shader!

And here is the Python script:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
import bge

cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()

VertexShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
   void main() // all vertex shaders define a main() function
   {
      gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         // this line transforms the predefined attribute gl_Vertex 
         // of type vec4 with the predefined uniform 
         // gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix of type mat4 and stores 
         // the result in the predefined output variable gl_Position 
         // of type vec4. (gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix combines 
         // the viewing transformation, modeling transformation and 
         // projection transformation in one matrix.)
   }
&quot;&quot;&quot;

FragmentShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
   void main()
   {   
      gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
         // this fragment shader just sets the output color to opaque
         // red (red = 1.0, green = 0.0, blue = 0.0, alpha = 1.0)
   }
&quot;&quot;&quot;

mesh = cont.owner.meshes[0]
for mat in mesh.materials:
    shader = mat.getShader()
    if shader != None:
        if not shader.isValid():
            shader.setSource(VertexShader, FragmentShader, 1)
&lt;/source&gt;

(If you are aware of easier ways to set the shaders for individual objects, please feel free to edit this page.)

===Editing Shaders===

This would be a good time to play with the shader; in particular, you can easily change the computed fragment color. Try neon green by opening the Python script in the '''Text Editor''' and replacing the fragment shader with this code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
   // this fragment shader should be assigned 
   // to &quot;FragmentShader&quot; in the script above

   void main()
   {   
      gl_FragColor = vec4(0.6, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0); 
         // red, green, blue, alpha
   }
&lt;/source&gt;
You have to start the game engine again to apply the new shader; see above. The color should now be green. You could also try to modify the red, green, and blue components to find the warmest orange or the darkest blue. (Actually, there is a [[w:Siam Sunset|movie]] about finding the warmest orange and [[w:Azuloscurocasinegro|another]] about dark blue that is almost black.)

You could also play with the vertex shader, e.g. try this vertex shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
   // this vertex shader should be assigned 
   // to &quot;VertexShader&quot; in the script above

   void main() 
   {
      gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * 
         (vec4(1.0, 0.1, 1.0, 1.0) * gl_Vertex);
   }
&lt;/source&gt;
This flattens any input geometry by multiplying the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; coordinate with &lt;math&gt;0.1&lt;/math&gt;. (This is a component-wise vector product; for more information on vectors and matrices in GLSL see the discussion in [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Vector and Matrix Operations|“Vector and Matrix Operations”]].)

In case the shader does not compile, Blender displays an error message in a console as described above:
 Blender Game Engine Started
 ---- Vertex Shader Error ----
 0:4(83): error: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting ',' or ';'
 
 ---- Vertex shader failed to compile ----
 Blender Game Engine Finished


=== Saving Your Work in a Scene ===

There is one more thing: you should save you work in a Blender file (the extension is &lt;code&gt;.blend&lt;/code&gt;). Choose '''File &gt; Save As ...''' from the menu of an '''Info window'''. (Remember that you can change the type of any Blender window with the icon in the top left or bottom left corner of the window).

=== One More Note about Terminology ===

It might be good to clarify the terminology. In GLSL, a “shader” is either a vertex shader or a fragment shader. The combination of both is called a “program”. 

Unfortunately, Blender refers to this kind of program as a “shader” while a vertex shader is called a “vertex program” and a fragment shader is called a “fragment program”.  

To make the confusion perfect, I'm going to use the word “shader” for a GLSL program, i.e. the combination of a vertex and a fragment shader. However, I will use the GLSL terms “vertex shader” and “fragment shader” instead of “vertex program” and “fragment program”.

===Summary===

Congratulations, you have reached the end of this tutorial. A few of the things you have seen are:
* How to create a Python script that specifies a GLSL shader in Blender. 
* How to activate that Python script for specific objects.
* How to manipulate the ouput color &lt;code&gt;gl_FragColor&lt;/code&gt; in the fragment shader.
* How to transform the input attribute &lt;code&gt;gl_Vertex&lt;/code&gt; in the vertex shader.
Actually, this was quite a lot of stuff. 

===Further Reading===

If you still want to know more 
* about vertex and fragment shaders in general, you should read the description of the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/OpenGL ES 2.0 Pipeline|“OpenGL ES 2.0 Pipeline”]].
* about handling vectors (e.g. the &lt;code&gt;vec4&lt;/code&gt; type) and matrices in GLSL, you should read [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Vector and Matrix Operations|“Vector and Matrix Operations”]].
* about the vertex transformations such as &lt;code&gt;gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix&lt;/code&gt;, you should read [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Vertex Transformations|“Vertex Transformations”]].
* about how to apply vertex transformations such as &lt;code&gt;gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix&lt;/code&gt;, you should read [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Applying Matrix Transformations|“Applying Matrix Transformations”]].
* about Blender's Python API for specifying shaders, you should read [http://www.blender.org/documentation/blender_python_api_2_62_release/bge.types.html#bge.types.BL_Shader  Blender's documentation of the class &lt;code&gt;bge.types.BL_Shader&lt;/code&gt;].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Peroxisomes ==

Peroxisomes perform a variety of metabolic processes and as a by-product, produce hydrogen peroxide. Peroxisomes use peroxase enzyme to break down this hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.

== Lysosomes ==

Lysosomes are vacuoles containing digestive and destructive membranes. In white blood cells, these are used to kill the bacteria or virus, while in tadpole-tail cells they kill the cell by separating the tail from the main body.

They also do much of the cellular digestion involved in apoptosis, the process of programmed cell death.

==Vacuole==
[[Image:Paramecium_contractile_vacuoles.jpg|thumb|right|Paramecium, with contractile vacuoles indicated using arrows.]]
Vacuoles are cellular storage places.  Like the cell membrane, they are comprised of a lipid bilayer that functions as a selectively permeable barrier to regulate movement of materials into and out of the compartment.  They can serve a variety of purposes, storing food, water, or waste products, or immune functions such as containing dangerous materials or maintaining turgor pressure (in plants).  Vacuoles serve very different purposes in plant cells than they do in animal cells.

'''Plant Cells'''  In plants, vacuoles comprise a significant portion of the cell's total volume and often contribute significantly to the function of a differentiated cell.  For example, vacuoles in stomata cells contain large numbers of potassium ions, which can be pumped in or out to open or close the stomata.

'''Animal Cells'''  In animal cells, vacuoles serve more subordinate roles, such as assisting in endo- and exocytosis or basic storage of food and waste.

'''Central Vacuole'''
The central vacuole is found only in plant cells. It is filled with water and is pressurised, like a balloon.  This forces all the other organelles within the cell out toward the cell wall. This pressure is called ''turgor pressure'' and is what gives plants their &quot;crisp&quot; and firm structure.

== Golgi apparatus ==

The Golgi Complex basically functions as a &quot;packaging center&quot; for the cell, attaching &quot;address labels&quot; (functional groups) to various cell products to direct them to their respective locations, and &quot;packaging&quot; the products into vacuoles to ensure delivery. Anatomically, the Golgi Complex consists of layers of lipid membrane stacked one one top of another, with a cis face and a trans face. As the molecular product being packaged moves through the complex, various enzymes act upon it to induce vacuole formation and functional group attachment.

==Endoplasmic Reticulum==

The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) acts as a transport from the nucleus and ribosomes to the Golgi apparatus. 
There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum:

===Smooth ER===
Smooth ER act as transport for various things, mainly the RNA from the nucleus to the ribosomes (RNA is a small piece of the DNA code specifically designed to tell the ribosomes what to make). Smooth ER appears smooth in texture, hence the name.  Smooth ER plays an important role in lipid emulsification and digestion in the cell.

===Rough ER===
Rough ER are &quot;rough&quot; because of the ribosomes embedded in them. The rough ER take the protein to the Golgi apparatus to be packaged into vacuoles

[[File:RGB color solid cube.png|200px|thumb|left|An RGB cube: the x, y, z coordinates are mapped to red, green, and blue color components.]]
This tutorial introduces '''varying variables'''. It builds on the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Minimal Shader|tutorial about a minimal shader]].

In this tutorial we will write a shader to render an RGB cube similar to the one shown to the left. The color of each point on the surface is determined by its coordinates; i.e., a point at position &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; has the color &lt;math&gt;(\text{red}, \text{green}, \text{blue}) = (x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the point &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)=(0,0,1)&lt;/math&gt; is mapped to the color &lt;math&gt;(\text{red}, \text{green}, \text{blue}) = (0,0,1)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. pure blue. (This is the blue corner in the lower right of the figure to the left.)

=== Preparations ===
Since we want to create an RGB cube, you first have to create a cube mesh as described in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Minimal Shader|tutorial about a minimal shader]]. Continue with creating a Python script and the game logic as described in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Minimal Shader|tutorial about a minimal shader]]. 
 
{{Clear}}
=== The Shader Code ===
Here is the source code of the vertex shader, which you should copy &amp; paste into the assignment to &lt;code&gt;VertexShader&lt;/code&gt; in your Python script:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
        varying vec4 position; 
           // this is a varying variable in the vertex shader
         
        void main()
        {
            position = 0.5 * (gl_Vertex + vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0));
               // Here the vertex shader writes output(!) to the 
               // varying variable. We add 1.0 to the x, y, and z 
               // coordinates and multiply by 0.5, because the 
               // coordinates of the cube are between -1.0 and 1.0 
               // but we need them between 0.0 and 1.0 
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
&lt;/source&gt;
And here is the source code of the fragment shader which should be assigned to &lt;code&gt;FragmentShader&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
         varying vec4 position; 
            // this is a varying variable in the fragment shader
         
         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = position;
               // Here the fragment shader reads intput(!) from the 
               // varying variable. The red, gree, blue, and alpha 
               // component of the fragment color are set to the 
               // values in the varying variable. (The alpha 
               // component of the fragment doesn't matter here.) 
         }
&lt;/source&gt;
If your cube is not colored correctly, check the console for error messages. 

=== Varying Variables ===
The main task of our shader is to set the output fragment color (&lt;code&gt;gl_FragColor&lt;/code&gt;) in the fragment shader to the position (&lt;code&gt;gl_Vertex&lt;/code&gt;) that is available in the vertex shader. Actually, this is not quite true: the coordinates in &lt;code&gt;gl_Vertex&lt;/code&gt; for Blenders's default cube are between -1.0 and +1.0 while we would like to have color components between 0.0 and 1.0; thus, we need to add 1.0 to the x, y, and z component and multiply the result with 0.5, which is done by this expression: &lt;code&gt;0.5 * (gl_Vertex + vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0))&lt;/code&gt;.

The main problem, however, is: how do we get any value from the vertex shader to the fragment shader? It turns out that the '''only''' way to do this is to use varying variables (or varyings for short). Output of the vertex shader can be written to a varying variable and then it can be read as input by the fragment shader. This is exactly what we need.

To specify a varying variable, it has to be defined with the modifier &lt;code&gt;varying&lt;/code&gt; (before the type) in the vertex and the fragment shader outside of any function; in our example: &lt;code&gt;varying vec4 position;&lt;/code&gt;. And here comes the most important rule about varying variables: 
{{Yellow Warning|'''The type and name of a varying variable definition in the vertex shader has to match exactly the type and name of a varying variable definition in the fragment shader and vice versa.'''}}
This is required to avoid ambiguous cases where the GLSL compiler cannot figure out which varying variable of the vertex shader should be matched to which varying variable of the fragment shader.

=== Variations of this Shader ===
The RGB cube represents the set of available colors (i.e. the gamut of the display). Thus, it can also be used show the effect of a color transformation. For example, a color to gray transformation would compute either the mean of the red, green, and blue color components, i.e. &lt;math&gt;(\text{red}+\text{green}+\text{blue}) / 3&lt;/math&gt;, and then put this value in all three color components of the fragment color to obtain a gray value of the same intensity. Instead of the mean, the relative luminance could also be used, which is &lt;math&gt;0.21 \text{ red} + 0.72 \text{ green} + 0.07 \text{ blue}&lt;/math&gt;. Of course, any other color transformation (changing saturation, contrast, hue, etc.) is also applicable.

Another variation of this shader could compute a CMY (cyan, magenta, yellow) cube: for position &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt; you could subtract from a pure white an amount of red that is proportional to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in order to produce cyan. Furthermore, you would subtract an amount of green in proportion to the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; component to produce magenta and also an amount of blue in proportion to &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; to produce yellow.

If you really want to get fancy, you could compute an HSV (hue, saturation, value) cylinder. For &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; coordinates between -0.5 and +0.5, you can get an angle &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; between 0 and 360° with &lt;code&gt;180.0+degrees(atan(z, x))&lt;/code&gt; in GLSL and a distance &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; between 0 and 1 from the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis with &lt;code&gt;2.0 * sqrt(x * x + z * z)&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; coordinate for Blender's built-in cylinder is between -1 and 1 which can be translated to a value &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; between 0 and 1 by &lt;math&gt;(y + 1.0) / 2.0&lt;/math&gt;. The computation of RGB colors from HSV coordinates is described in the [[w:HSL and HSV#From HSV|article on HSV in Wikipedia]].

=== Interpolation of Varying Variables ===
The story about varying variables is not quite over yet. If you select the cube object in the '''3D View''' and switch to '''Edit Mode''', you will see that that it includes only 8 vertices. Thus, the vertex shader might be called only eight times and only eight different outputs are written to the varying variable. However, there are many more colors on the cube. How did that happen?

The answer is implied by the name '''varying''' variables. They are called this way because they vary across a triangle. (Note that all polygons are decomposed into triangles before they are rendered in OpenGL.) In fact, the vertex shader is only called for each vertex of each triangle. If the vertex shader writes different values to a varying variable for different vertices, the values are interpolated across the triangle. The fragment shader is then called for each pixel that is covered by the triangle and receives interpolated values of the varying variables. The details of this interpolation are described in [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Rasterization|“Rasterization”]].

If you want to make sure that a fragment shader receives one exact, non-interpolated value by a vertex shader, you have to make sure that the vertex shader writes the same value to the varying variable for all vertices of a triangle.

=== Summary ===
And this is the end of this tutorial. Congratulations! Among other things, you have seen:
* What an RGB cube is.
* What varying variables are good for and how to define them.
* How the values written to a varying variable by the vertex shader are interpolated across a triangle before they are received by the fragment shader.

[[File:Inundaciones en Argentina Argentina.A2003128.1420.721.250m.jpg|200px|thumb|left|A false-color satellite image.]]
This tutorial introduces '''attribute variables'''. It builds on the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Minimal Shader|tutorial about a minimal shader]] and the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/RGB_Cube|RGB-cube tutorial about varying variables]]. 

This tutorial also introduces the main technique to debug shaders in Blender: false-color images, i.e. a value is visualized by setting one of the components of the fragment color to it. Then the intensity of that color component in the resulting image allows you to make conclusions about the value in the shader. This might appear to be a very primitive debugging technique because it is a very primitive debugging technique. Unfortunately, there is no alternative in Blender. 

=== Where Does the Vertex Data Come from? ===
In the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Minimal Shader|RGB-cube tutorial]] you have seen how the fragment shader gets its data from the vertex shader by means of varying variables. The question here is: where does the vertex shader get its data from? Within Blender this data is specified for each selected object by the settings in the '''Properties window''', in particular the settings in the '''Object Data tab''', '''Material tab''', and '''Textures tab'''. All the data of the mesh of the object is sent to OpenGL in each frame. (This is often called a “draw call”. Note that each draw call has some performance overhead; thus, it is much more efficient to send one large mesh with one draw call to OpenGL than to send several smaller meshes with multiple draw calls.) This data usually consists of a long list of triangles, where each triangle is defined by three vertices and each vertex has certain attributes, including position. These attributes are made available in the vertex shader by means of attribute variables. 

=== Built-in Attribute Variables and how to Visualize Them ===
In Blender, most of the standard attributes (position, color, surface normal, and texture coordinates) are built in, i.e. you need not (in fact must not) define them. The names of these built-in attributes are actually defined by the OpenGL “compability profile” because such built-in names are needed if you mix an OpenGL application that was written for the fixed-function pipeline with a (programmable) vertex shader. If you had to define them, the definitions (only in the vertex shader) would look like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
   attribute vec4 gl_Vertex; // position (in object coordinates, 
      // i.e. local or model coordinates)
   attribute vec4 gl_Color; // color (usually constant)
   attribute vec3 gl_Normal; // surface normal vector 
      // (usually normalized; also in object coordinates)
   attribute vec4 gl_MultiTexCoord0; //0th set of texture coordinates 
      // (a.k.a. “UV”; between 0 and 1) 
   attribute vec4 gl_MultiTexCoord1; //1st set of texture coordinates 
      // (a.k.a. “UV”; between 0 and 1)
   ...
&lt;/source&gt;
There is only one attribute variable that is provided by Blender but has no standard name in OpenGL, namely the tangent vector, i.e. a vector that is orthogonal to the surface normal. You should define this variable yourself as an attribute variable of type &lt;code&gt;vec4&lt;/code&gt; with the specific name &lt;code&gt;tangent&lt;/code&gt; as shown in the following shader:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import bge

cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()

VertexShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
   varying vec4 color;
   attribute vec4 tangent; // this attribute is specific to Blender 
      // and has to be defined explicitly

   void main()
   {
       color = gl_MultiTexCoord0; // set the varying to this attribute
    
       // other possibilities to play with:
    
       // color = gl_Vertex;
       // color = gl_Color;
       // color = vec4(gl_Normal, 1.0);
       // color = gl_MultiTexCoord0;
       // color = gl_MultiTexCoord1;
       // color = tangent;

       gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
   }
&quot;&quot;&quot;

FragmentShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
   varying vec4 color;

   void main()
   {   
      gl_FragColor = color;
   }
&quot;&quot;&quot;


mesh = cont.owner.meshes[0]
for mat in mesh.materials:
    shader = mat.getShader()
    if shader != None:
        if not shader.isValid():
            shader.setSource(VertexShader, FragmentShader, 1)
            shader.setAttrib(bge.logic.SHD_TANGENT)
&lt;/source&gt;
Note the line

&lt;code&gt;            shader.setAttrib(bge.logic.SHD_TANGENT)&lt;/code&gt;

in the Python script which tells Blender to provide the shader with tangent attributes. However, Blender will only provide several of the attributes for certain settings in the '''Properties window''', in particular something should be specified as '''UV Maps''' in the '''Object Data tab''' (just click on the “+” button), a material should be defined in the '''Material tab''', and a texture (e.g. any image) should be defined in the '''Textures tab'''.

In the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Minimal Shader|RGB-cube tutorial]] we have already seen, how to visualize the &lt;code&gt;gl_Vertex&lt;/code&gt; coordinates by setting the fragment color to those values. In this example, the fragment color is set to &lt;code&gt;gl_MultiTexCoord0&lt;/code&gt; such that we can see what kind of texture coordinates Blender provides for certain settings in the '''Properties window'''.

=== How to Interpret False-Color Images ===
When trying to understand the information in a false-color image, it is important to focus on one color component only. For example, if the attribute &lt;code&gt;gl_MultiTexCoord0&lt;/code&gt; is written to the fragment color then the red component of the fragment visualizes the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; coordinate of &lt;code&gt;gl_MultiTexCoord0&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. it doesn't matter whether the output color is maximum pure red or maximum yellow or maximum magenta, in all cases the red component is 1. On the other hand, it also doesn't matter for the red component whether the color is blue or green or cyan of any intensity because the red component is 0 in all cases. If you have never learned to focus solely on one color components, this is probably quite challenging; therefore, you might consider to look only at one color component at a time. For example by using this line to set the varying in the vertex shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
            color = vec4(gl_MultiTexCoord0.x, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0); 
&lt;/source&gt;
This sets the red component of the varying variable to the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; component of &lt;code&gt;gl_MultiTexCoord0&lt;/code&gt; but sets the green and blue components to 0 (and the alpha or opacity component to 1 but that doesn't matter in this shader).

The specific texture coordinates that Blender sends to the vertex shader depend on the '''UV Maps''' that is specified in the '''Object Data tab''' and the '''Mapping''' that is specified in the '''Textures tab'''. 

Texture coordinates are particularly nice to visualize because they are between 0 and 1 just like color components are. Almost as nice are coordinates of normalized vectors (i.e., vectors of length 1; for example, &lt;code&gt;gl_Normal&lt;/code&gt; is usually normalized) because they are always between -1 and +1. To map this range to the range from 0 to 1, you add 1 to each component and divide all components by 2, e.g.: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
            color = vec4((gl_Normal + vec3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)) / 2.0, 1.0); 
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that &lt;code&gt;gl_Normal&lt;/code&gt; is a three-dimensional vector. Black corresponds then to the coordinate -1 and full intensity of one component to the coordinate +1.

If the value that you want to visualize is in another range than 0 to 1 or -1 to +1, you have to map it to the range from 0 to 1, which is the range of color components. If you don't know which values to expect, you just have to experiment. What helps here is that if you specify color components outside of the range 0 to 1, they are automatically clamped to this range. I.e., values less than 0 are set to 0 and values greater than 1 are set to 1. Thus, when the color component is 0 or 1 you know at least that the value is less or greater than what you assumed and then you can adapt the mapping iteratively until the color component is between 0 and 1.
 
=== Debugging Practice ===

In order to practice the debugging of shaders, this section includes some lines that produce black colors when the assignment to &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; in the vertex shader is replaced by each of them. Your task is to figure out for each line, why the result is black. To this end, you should try to visualize any value that you are not absolutely sure about and map the values less than 0 or greater than 1 to other ranges such that the values are visible and you have at least an idea in which range they are. Note that most of the functions and operators are documented in [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Vector and Matrix Operations|“Vector and Matrix Operations”]].

&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
            color = gl_MultiTexCoord0 - vec4(1.5, 2.3, 1.1, 0.0);
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
            color = vec4(1.0 - gl_MultiTexCoord0.w);
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
            color = gl_MultiTexCoord0 / tan(0.0);
&lt;/source&gt;

The following lines work only with spheres and require some knowledge about the dot and cross product:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
            color = dot(gl_Normal, vec3(tangent)) * gl_MultiTexCoord0;
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
            color = dot(cross(gl_Normal, vec3(tangent)), gl_Normal) * 
               gl_MultiTexCoord0;
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
            color = vec4(cross(gl_Normal, gl_Normal), 1.0);
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
            color = vec4(cross(gl_Normal, gl_Vertex), 1.0); 
&lt;/source&gt;
Does the function &lt;code&gt;radians()&lt;/code&gt; always return black? What's that good for?

&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
            color = radians(gl_MultiTexCoord0);
&lt;/source&gt;

Consult the documentation in the “OpenGL ES Shading Language 1.0.17 Specification” available at the [http://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/ “Khronos OpenGL ES API Registry”] to figure out what &lt;code&gt;radians()&lt;/code&gt; is good for.

=== Special Variables in the Fragment Shader === 

Attributes are specific to vertices, i.e., they usually have different values for different vertices. There are similar variables for fragment shaders, i.e., variables that have different values for each fragment. However, they are different from attributes because they are not specified by a mesh (i.e. a list of triangles). They are also different from varyings because they are not set explicitly by the vertex shader.

Specifically, a four-dimensional vector &lt;code&gt;gl_FragCoord&lt;/code&gt; is available containing the screen (or: window) coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z,1/w)&lt;/math&gt; of the fragment that is processed; see [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Vertex Transformations|“Vertex Transformations”]] for the description of the screen coordinate system.  

Moreover, a boolean variable &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontFacing&lt;/code&gt; is provided that specifies whether the front face or the back face of a triangle is being rendered. Front faces usually face the “outside” of a model and back faces face the “inside” of a model; however, there is no clear outside or inside if the model is not a closed surface. Usually, the surface normal vectors point in the direction of the front face, but this is not required. In fact, front faces and back faces are specified by the order of the vertex triangles: if the vertices appear in counter-clockwise order, the front face is visible; if they appear in clockwise order, the back face is visible. An application is shown in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Cutaways|tutorial on cutaways]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Use 
  position: relative; text-align:right; for the container, 
  position: absolute; left:0 for the left aligned element, 
  and display: inline or inline-block for the right element
to emulate floating and create bookends for a masthead without encountering the side effects of floats

Use absolutely positioned divs nested in a relatively positioned wrapper to create equal height columns using the following steps:

- Create the columns using floats or inline-block

- Create a wrapper div around all the columns and set it to be relatively positioned

- Place an absolutely positioned div as the last element inside the wrapper div

- Set the absolutely positioned div to { bottom:0; height: 100%; z-index: -1; }

- Set the height to a fixed number large enough to fill the columns for IE6

- Set the width of the absolutely positioned div equal to the width of the first column

- Set the left offset of the absolutely positioned div so that it overlaps the first column

- Set the desired border and background color of the absolutely positioned div

- Repeat this step for the remaining columns if necessary

- Set { position:relative; z-index:2; }, add vertical padding(or replace margins with padding) and reset the background on any containers above or below the columns to hide the overflow in IE6

- Set { top:1px; margin-top: -1px; } to vertically align the absolutely positioned div in IE6

- Set clip:rect(0 ## 9999px 0); where ## is the width of the column to truncate horizontal overflow in IE6

- If z-index:2 fails in IE6, make it higher than the z-index of the wrapper div if they are in the same parent

- If z-index:2 still fails in IE6, make it higher than the z-index of the wrapper div's parent

Use nested spans to created irregularly shaped anchors without image maps with the following steps:
- Use the same setup as above to nest spans within anchors

- Set the anchors and the spans to be absolutely positioned

- Set the ul to be relatively positioned

- Set a single background image for both the anchors and spans

- Reposition the anchors and spans so that the bounding boxes for the anchors do not overlap

- Change the background position of the anchors and spans on :hover to match the rollover state

I note your recent edit of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue]]. Unfortunately I did have to revert you. I'll grant you that the question you removed is easily answered, but it is speculation, as nowhere in the 10-book canon does it say how Dumbledore had learned Parseltongue. And speculation is the most fertile ground for study questions, always.

Again, thank you for your interest, and I hope you keep editing. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:31, 8 August 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}
[[File:Chamäleon1.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Some chameleons are able to change their color according to the world around them.]]
This tutorial introduces '''uniform variables'''. It builds on the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Minimal Shader|tutorial about a minimal shader]], the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/RGB Cube|tutorial about an RGB cube]], and the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Debugging of Shaders|tutorial about debugging of shaders]].

In this tutorial we will look at a shader that changes the fragment color depending on its position in “view space”, which is just a rotated version of world space in which the camera is at the origin and points to the negative &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis while the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis is aligned to the vertical axis of the camera; see the description in [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Vertex Transformations|“Vertex Transformations”]]. The concept is not too complicated; however, there are extremely important applications, e.g. shading with lights and environment maps. We will also have a look at shaders in the real world; i.e., what is necessary to enable non-programmers to use your shaders?

=== Transforming from Object to View Space ===
As mentioned in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Debugging of Shaders|tutorial about debugging of shaders]], the attribute &lt;code&gt;gl_Vertex&lt;/code&gt; specifies object coordinates, i.e. coordinates in the local object (or model) space of a mesh. The object space (or object coordinate system) is specific to each object; however, all objects are transformed into one common coordinate system — the view space. Conceptually they are first transformed to the common world space (with the model transformation) and then to the view space (with the view transformation). In practice, both transformations are combined into one transformation (the model-view transformation).

If an object is put directly into the world space, the object-to-world transformation is specified in Blender by the transform section of the object properties. To see it, select the object in the '''3D View''' and then open the '''Object tab''' of the '''Properties window''' and expand the '''Transform''' section. There are parameters for “Location”, “Rotation” and “Scale”, which specify how vertices are transformed from object coordinates to world coordinates. The transformations of vertices by translations, rotations and scalings, as well as the combination of transformations and their representation as 4×4 matrices are discussed in [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Vertex Transformations|“Vertex Transformations”]]. That page also discusses the transformation from world to view space, which only depends on the position and orientation of the camera (which can be inspected by selecting the camera and then opening a '''Properties window'''; it can be activated by choosing '''View &gt; Camera''' in the menu of a '''3D View''').

In the following example, the transformation from object space to view space is put into a 4×4 matrix, which is also known as “model-view matrix” (since it combines the “model transformation” and the “view transformation”). This matrix is available in the built-in uniform variable &lt;code&gt;gl_ModelViewMatrix&lt;/code&gt; (similarly to the &lt;code&gt;gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix&lt;/code&gt; that has been used in previous tutorials). This uniform is used in the following vertex shader, which should be assigned to the variable &lt;code&gt;VertexShader&lt;/code&gt; of the Python script in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Minimal Shader|tutorial about a minimal shader]]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec4 position_in_view_space;

         void main()
         {
            position_in_view_space = gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex;
               // transformation of gl_Vertex from object coordinates 
               // to view coordinates;
            
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
&lt;/source&gt;
The fragment shader should be assigned to the variable &lt;code&gt;FragmentShader&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;         
         varying vec4 position_in_view_space;

         void main()
         {
            float dist = distance(position_in_view_space, 
               vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0));
               // computes the distance between the fragment position 
               // and the origin (4th coordinate should always be 1 
               // for points). The origin in view space is actually 
               // the camera position.
            
            if (dist &lt; 5.0)
            {
               gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0); 
                  // color near origin
            }
            else
            {
               gl_FragColor = vec4(0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 1.0); 
                  // color far from origin
            }
         }
&lt;/source&gt;

Usually, an OpenGL application has to set the value of uniform variables; however, Blender takes care of setting the values of predefined uniform variables such as &lt;code&gt;gl_ModelViewMatrix&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix&lt;/code&gt; (which is actually the matrix product &lt;code&gt;gl_ProjectionMatrix * gl_ModelViewMatrix&lt;/code&gt;); thus, we don't have to worry about it. (In some cases, however, Blender appears to set some of these matrices incorrectly (in particular &lt;code&gt;gl_ModelViewMatrix&lt;/code&gt;) unless the camera view is activated with '''3D View &gt; View &gt; Cameras &gt; Active Camera'''.) 

This shader transforms the vertex position to view space and gives it to the fragment shader in a varying variable. For the fragment shader the varying variable contains the interpolated position of the fragment in view coordinates. Based on the distance of this position to the origin of the view coordinate system, one of two colors is set. Thus, if you move an object with this shader around, it will turn green near the camera. Farther away from the camera it will turn dark grey.

=== Transforming from View Space to World Space ===
Many computations in shaders can be performed in view space. Since the position of light sources are specified in view space and no transformations to world space are provided by default, this is often the most convenient and efficient coordinate system to work in. However, in some cases it's necessary to work in world space (for example, when using environment maps which are positioned in world space). In these cases it is necessary to provide the shader with the transformation from view space to world space in a uniform variable. The uniform variable has to be defined outside the main function in any shader that uses it:

&lt;code&gt;uniform mat4 viewMatrixInverse;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;mat4&lt;/code&gt; is just the data type for 4×4 matrices and &lt;code&gt;uniform&lt;/code&gt; indicates that it is the same value for all vertices and fragments, which has to be set externally. In fact, in Blender it is set in a Python script with the line

&lt;code&gt;shader.setUniformMatrix4('viewMatrixInverse', value_of_uniform)&lt;/code&gt;

where &lt;code&gt;shader&lt;/code&gt; is the Python object of the shader program, &lt;code&gt;'viewMatrixInverse'&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the uniform variable in the shader, and &lt;code&gt;value_of_uniform&lt;/code&gt; is the value it should be set to. &lt;code&gt;setUnifomMatrix4&lt;/code&gt; is used to set a 4×4 matrix uniform as documented in [http://www.blender.org/documentation/blender_python_api_2_62_release/bge.types.html#bge.types.BL_Shader.setUniformMatrix4 Blender's Python API]. More functions are available to set uniforms of others types.

Here, we need the 4×4 matrix that transforms points from view space (also known as eye or camera space) to world space, which can be obtained this way:

&lt;code&gt;value_of_uniform = bge.logic.getCurrentScene().active_camera.camera_to_world&lt;/code&gt;

I.e. the current scene provides an active camera, which provides the transformation that we need. (Just for completeness: the camera also provides the matrix for the &lt;code&gt;world_to_camera&lt;/code&gt; transformation, i.e. the view matrix itself.)

We can now rewrite the example to work in world space instead of view space, i.e. fragments are colored green if they are close to the origin in world space:

&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
import bge

cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()

VertexShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
         uniform mat4 viewMatrixInverse; // view to world 
            // transformation (the view matrix corresponds to the 
            // world to view transformation; thus, the inverse 
            // matrix corresponds to the view to world trafo)

         varying vec4 position_in_world_space;

         void main()
         {
            vec4 position_in_view_space = 
               gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex;
               // transformation of gl_Vertex from object coordinates 
               // to view coordinates;
            position_in_world_space = viewMatrixInverse * 
               position_in_view_space;
               // transformation of gl_Vertex from view coordinates 
               // to world coordinates;
            
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
&quot;&quot;&quot;

FragmentShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
         varying vec4 position_in_world_space;

         void main()
         {
            float dist = distance(position_in_world_space, 
               vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0));
               // computes the distance between the fragment position 
               // and the origin (the 4th coordinate should always 
               // be 1 for points). 
            
            if (dist &lt; 5.0)
            {
               gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0); 
                  // color near origin
            }
            else
            {
               gl_FragColor = vec4(0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 1.0); 
                  // color far from origin
            }
         }
&quot;&quot;&quot;

mesh = cont.owner.meshes[0]
for mat in mesh.materials:
    shader = mat.getShader()
    if shader != None:
        if not shader.isValid():
            shader.setSource(VertexShader, FragmentShader, 1)
        value_of_uniform = \
            bge.logic.getCurrentScene().active_camera.camera_to_world
        shader.setUniformMatrix4('viewMatrixInverse', value_of_uniform)
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that we should set the current value of the uniform in every frame while we set the source code of the shader only once.

Also note that there is one additional transformation in the vertex shader. This is a matrix-vector multiplication, which includes 16 multiplications and therefore costs some performance. If possible, this kind of additional transformations should be avoided. In practice, we will therefore do lighting computations in view space such that we don't have to transform the view-space positions of light sources to world space.

=== More OpenGL-Specific Uniforms ===
The positions of light sources are actually available as built-in uniforms similar to &lt;code&gt;gl_ModelViewMatrix&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gl_ProjectionModelViewMatrix&lt;/code&gt;. All these built-in uniforms are defined for the OpenGL compability profile. The corresponding transformations are described in detail in [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Vertex Transformations|“Vertex Transformations”]].

As you can see in the shader above, these uniforms don't have to be defined; they are always available in GLSL shaders in Blender. If you had to define them, the definitions would look like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
      uniform mat4 gl_ModelViewMatrix;
      uniform mat4 gl_ProjectionMatrix;
      uniform mat4 gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix;
      uniform mat4 gl_TextureMatrix[gl_MaxTextureCoords];
      uniform mat3 gl_NormalMatrix; 
         // transpose of the inverse of gl_ModelViewMatrix
      uniform mat4 gl_ModelViewMatrixInverse;
      uniform mat4 gl_ProjectionMatrixInverse;
      uniform mat4 gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrixInverse;
      uniform mat4 gl_TextureMatrixInverse[gl_MaxTextureCoords];
      uniform mat4 gl_ModelViewMatrixTranspose;
      uniform mat4 gl_ProjectionMatrixTranspose;
      uniform mat4 gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrixTranspose;
      uniform mat4 gl_TextureMatrixTranspose[gl_MaxTextureCoords];
      uniform mat4 gl_ModelViewMatrixInverseTranspose;
      uniform mat4 gl_ProjectionMatrixInverseTranspose;
      uniform mat4 gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrixInverseTranspose;
      uniform mat4 gl_TextureMatrixInverseTranspose[
         gl_MaxTextureCoords];

      struct gl_MaterialParameters {
         vec4 emission; // = Properties &gt; Material tab &gt; Diffuse Color * 
            // Shading &gt; Emit (alpha = 1)
         vec4 ambient; // = black
         vec4 diffuse; // = black
         vec4 specular; // = Properties &gt; Material tab &gt; Specular Color
            // * Intensity (alpha = Intensity!)
         float shininess; 
            // = Properties &gt; Material tab &gt; Specular &gt; Hardness / 4.0
      }; 
      uniform gl_MaterialParameters gl_FrontMaterial; // see above
      uniform gl_MaterialParameters gl_BackMaterial; 
         // same as gl_FrontMaterial

      struct gl_LightSourceParameters {
         vec4 ambient; // = black
         vec4 diffuse; // = Properties &gt; Object Data tab &gt; Color * 
            // Energy (alpha = 1)
         vec4 specular; // = Properties &gt; Object Data tab &gt; Color * 
            // Energy (alpha = 1)
         vec4 position; // in view space, w = 0 for Sun (directional), 
            // w = 1 otherwise 
         vec4 halfVector; // = average of vectors to light and viewer 
         vec3 spotDirection; // in view space
         float spotExponent; // = Properties &gt; Object Data tab &gt; 
            // Spot Shape &gt; Blend * 128.0 
         float spotCutoff; // = Properties &gt; Object Data tab &gt; 
            // Spot Shape &gt; Size / 2.0 (180.0 if not spotlight)
         float spotCosCutoff; // derived: cos(spotCutoff) 
            // (range: [1.0,0.0] or -1.0 if not spotlight)
         float constantAttenuation; // = 1.0
         float linearAttenuation; // = 0.0
         float quadraticAttenuation;// = 0.0
      };
      uniform gl_LightSourceParameters gl_LightSource[gl_MaxLights]; 
         // see above for each light

      struct gl_LightModelParameters 
      { 
         vec4 ambient; // = Properties &gt; World tab &gt; World &gt; Ambient Color
            // * Material tab &gt; Shading &gt; Ambient
      };
      uniform gl_LightModelParameters gl_LightModel; // see above
      ...
&lt;/source&gt;
In fact, the compability profile of OpenGL defines even more (less interesting) uniforms; see Chapter 7 of the “OpenGL Shading Language 4.10.6 Specification” available at [http://www.khronos.org/opengl/ Khronos' OpenGL page]. Apparently Blender supports many of them but not all.

Some of these uniforms are arrays, e.g &lt;code&gt;gl_TextureMatrix&lt;/code&gt;. In fact, an array of matrices
&lt;code&gt;gl_TextureMatrix[0]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gl_TextureMatrix[1]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gl_TextureMatrix[2]&lt;/code&gt;, ..., &lt;code&gt;gl_TextureMatrix[gl_MaxTextureCoords - 1]&lt;/code&gt; is available, where &lt;code&gt;gl_MaxTextureCoords&lt;/code&gt; is a built-in integer.

Others are structs, e.g. &lt;code&gt;gl_LightModel&lt;/code&gt;; thus, you have to use the dot-notation to access its members, e.g. &lt;code&gt;gl_LightModel.ambient&lt;/code&gt; for the ambient scene color.

=== Computing the Model Matrix ===

As we saw above, it is possible to access the view matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M}_{\text{world→view}}&lt;/math&gt; and the inverse view matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M}_{\text{view→world}}&lt;/math&gt; with the help of a Python script. On the other hand, OpenGL offers the product of the model matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M}_{\text{object→world}}&lt;/math&gt; and the view matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M}_{\text{world→view}}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the model-view matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M}_{\text{object→view}}&lt;/math&gt;, which is available in the uniform &lt;code&gt;gl_ModelViewMatrix&lt;/code&gt;. What is not so easily available is the model matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M}_{\text{object→world}}&lt;/math&gt;.

However, we can easily compute it. The mathematics looks like this:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M}_{\text{object}\to\text{view}} = \mathrm{M}_{\text{world}\to\text{view}} \mathrm{M}_{\text{object}\to\text{world}}\,&lt;/math&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \mathrm{M}_{\text{object}\to\text{world}} = \mathrm{M}_{\text{world}\to\text{view}}^{-1} \mathrm{M}_{\text{object}\to\text{view}} 
&lt;/math&gt; 

In other words, the model matrix is the product of the inverse view matrix and the model-view matrix. Assuming that we have defined the uniform &lt;code&gt;viewMatrixInverse&lt;/code&gt; as above, we can compute the model matrix this way in GLSL:

&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
      mat4 modelMatrix = viewMatrixInverse * gl_ModelViewMatrix;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== User-Specified Uniforms: Game Properties ===
There is an important application of uniform variables: uniforms that can be set by the user. Actually, these are called game properties in Blender. You can think of them as parameters of objects and, more specifically, of their shaders. A shader without parameters is usually used only by its programmer because even the smallest necessary change requires some programming. On the other hand, a shader using parameters with descriptive names can be used by other people, even non-programmers, e.g. CG artists. Imagine you are in a game development team and a CG artist asks you to adapt your shader for each of 100 design iterations. It should be obvious that a few parameters, which even a CG artist can play with, might save '''you''' a lot of time. Also, imagine you want to sell your shader: parameters will often dramatically increase the value of your shader. 

The [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.5/Manual/Game_Engine/Logic/Properties Blender documentation about game properties] describes how to set up a new game property: Select the object that the Python script is attached to. Open the '''Logic Editor''' and choose '''View &gt; Properties''' from the menu (or press '''n''' or click the small icon in the upper left corner). Click on '''Add Game Property''' and set the name to &lt;code&gt;my_uniform&lt;/code&gt; and the type to &lt;code&gt;Float&lt;/code&gt;. We can then define a uniform in the shader (which could have a different name if we want to confuse ourselves) and set it with the Python function 

&lt;code&gt;shader.setUniform1f('my_uniform', cont.owner.get('my_uniform'))&lt;/code&gt;

where the first &lt;code&gt;'my_uniform'&lt;/code&gt; refers to the name in the shader and the second &lt;code&gt;'my_uniform'&lt;/code&gt; refers to the name of the game property. &lt;code&gt;setUniform1f&lt;/code&gt; is used to set one-dimensional floating-point uniforms while other functions are available to set uniforms of others types, as documented in [http://www.blender.org/documentation/blender_python_api_2_62_release/bge.types.html#bge.types.BL_Shader.setUniform1f Blender's Python API].

A simple example could then use the following Python script, which uses the value of the game property to set the intensity of the red component of the fragment's color:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
import bge

cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()

VertexShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
   void main()
   {
      gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
   }

&quot;&quot;&quot;

FragmentShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
   uniform float my_uniform;

   void main()
   {   
      gl_FragColor = vec4(my_uniform, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
   }
&quot;&quot;&quot;

mesh = cont.owner.meshes[0]
for mat in mesh.materials:
    shader = mat.getShader()
    if shader != None:
        if not shader.isValid():
            shader.setSource(VertexShader, FragmentShader, 1)
        shader.setUniform1f('my_uniform', cont.owner.get('my_uniform'))
&lt;/source&gt;

= Introduction =

Most of the documentation on OpenGL uses features that are being deprecated, in particular the &quot;fixed pipeline&quot;.
OpenGL 2.0 and later comes with a '''programmable pipeline''', where the programmable part is done with '''shaders''', written in the '''GLSL''' C-like language.

This document is for people who are learning OpenGL and want to use modern OpenGL from the start.
The programmable pipeline is more flexible, but less intuitive than the fixed pipeline. We'll however make sure that we start with '''simple code''' first. We'll use an approach similar to NeHe's tutorials for OpenGL 1.x, with examples and tutorials to better understand the theory behind a '''programmable pipeline'''.

At first the vertex arrays and shaders look like a pain to work with compared to the old immediate mode and fixed rendering pipeline&lt;ref&gt;Since so many 3D features were removed in OpenGL 2, some interestingly [http://greggman.github.io/webgl-fundamentals/webgl/lessons/webgl-2d-vs-3d-library.html define it as a 2D rasteration engine]!&lt;/ref&gt;. However, in the end, especially if you are using buffer objects, your code will be '''much cleaner''' and the graphics will be '''faster'''.

The code examples in this page are in the '''public domain'''.  Feel free to do what you want with them.

'''Share''' this document with your friends!  Wikibooks deserves more recognition and contributions :)

Notes:
* It is possible to mix fixed pipeline and programmable pipeline to some extent, but fixed pipeline is being deprecated, and not available at all in OpenGL ES 2.0 (or its WebGL derivative), so we won't use it.
* There is now OpenGL 3 and 4, which notably introduce geometry shaders, but this time it is only a light evolution compared to the previous version. Since it is not available on '''mobile platforms''' as of 2012, for now we'll concentrate on OpenGL 2.0.

= Base libraries =

You will need to make sure OpenGL, GLUT and GLEW are ready to use.
Check
[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixIndex&amp;prefix=OpenGL+Programming%2FInstallation&amp;namespace=0 the installation pages]
to prepare everything for your system.

To situate these libraries in the OpenGL stack, check [[../APIs,_Libraries_and_acronyms|APIs, Libraries and acronyms]].

Note: we chose GLUT because it is as minimal as a portable layer can get.  We won't use advanced features, and almost all of our code will be plain OpenGL, so you'll have no troubles to move to another, more general library such as GLFW, SDL and SFML when you'll create your new game or application.  We may write specific tutorials to cover how to switch to these libraries.

= Displaying a triangle in 2D =

Let's start simple :)
Rather than struggling with a complex program that would take us a long time to hack until it works for the first time, the goal here is to get a basic but functional program that we can then improve upon step by step, 

The triangle is the most basic unit in 3D programming. Actually, everything you see in video games is made of triangles! Small, textured triangles, but triangles nonetheless :)

To display a triangle in the programmable pipeline, we'll need at minimum:
* a Makefile to build our application
* initialize OpenGL and the helper libraries
* an array with the coordinates of the 3 vertices (plural of vertex, i.e. a 3D point) of the triangle
* a GLSL program with:
** a vertex shader: we pass it each vertex individually, and it will compute their on-screen (2D) coordinates
** a fragment (pixel) shader: OpenGL will pass it each pixel that is contained in our triangle, and it will compute its color
* pass the vertices to the vertex shader

== Makefile ==

It is very easy to configure 'make' for our example. Write this in a 'Makefile' file:
 LDLIBS=-lglut -lGLEW -lGL
 all: triangle

To compile your application, type in a terminal:
 make

A little more fancy Makefile looks like this:
 CC=g++
 LDLIBS=-lglut -lGLEW -lGL
 all: triangle
 clean:
         rm -f *.o triangle
 .PHONY: all clean

This allows you to type 'make clean' which removes the triangle binary and any intermediate object files that may have been generated.
The .PHONY rule is there to tell make that &quot;all&quot; and &quot;clean&quot; are not files, so it will not get confused if you actually have files named like that in the same directory.

A Makefile for MacOS looks like this:
 CFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include/
 LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib/ -I/opt/local/include/
 LDLIBS=-lGLEW -framework GLUT -framework OpenGL -framework Cocoa
 all: triangle
 clean:
         rm -f *.o triangle

This makefile assumes that you installed glew using [http://www.macports.org/ MacPorts].

If you want to use a different programming environment, see the [[OpenGL_Programming#Setting_Up_OpenGL|Setting Up OpenGL]] section.

== Initialization ==

Let's create a file triangle.c:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* Using the standard output for fprintf */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
/* Use glew.h instead of gl.h to get all the GL prototypes declared */
#include &lt;GL/glew.h&gt;
/* Using the GLUT library for the base windowing setup */
#include &lt;GL/freeglut.h&gt;
/* ADD GLOBAL VARIABLES HERE LATER */

int init_resources(void)
{
  /* FILLED IN LATER */
  return 1;
}

void onDisplay()
{
  /* FILLED IN LATER */
}

void free_resources()
{
  /* FILLED IN LATER */
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  /* Glut-related initialising functions */
  glutInit(&amp;argc, argv);
  glutInitContextVersion(2,0);
  glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGBA|GLUT_DOUBLE|GLUT_DEPTH);
  glutInitWindowSize(640, 480);
  glutCreateWindow(&quot;My First Triangle&quot;);

  /* Extension wrangler initialising */
  GLenum glew_status = glewInit();
  if (glew_status != GLEW_OK)
  {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error: %s\n&quot;, glewGetErrorString(glew_status));
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  }

  /* When all init functions run without errors,
  the program can initialise the resources */
  if (init_resources())
  {
    /* We can display it if everything goes OK */
    glutDisplayFunc(onDisplay);
    glutMainLoop();
  }

  /* If the program exits in the usual way,
  free resources and exit with a success */
  free_resources();
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In &lt;code&gt;init_resources&lt;/code&gt;, we'll create our GLSL program.
In &lt;code&gt;onDisplay&lt;/code&gt;, we'll draw the triangle.
In &lt;code&gt;free_resources&lt;/code&gt;, we'll destroy the GLSL program.

== Vertex array ==

Our first triangle will be displayed in 2D - we'll move into something more complex soon.
We describe the triangle with the 2D (x,y) coordinates of its 3 points.
By default, OpenGL's coordinates are within the [-1, 1] range.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  GLfloat triangle_vertices[] = {
     0.0,  0.8,
    -0.8, -0.8,
     0.8, -0.8
  };
&lt;/source&gt;

For now let's just keep this data structure in mind, we'll write it in the code later.

Note: the coordinates are between -1 and +1, but our window is not square! In the next lessons, we'll see how to fix the aspect ratio.

== Vertex shader ==

This is the GLSL program that will get each point of our array one by one, and tell where to put them on the screen.
In this case, our points are already in 2D screen coordinates, so we don't change them.
Our GLSL program is like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
#version 120
attribute vec2 coord2d;
void main(void) {
  gl_Position = vec4(coord2d, 0.0, 1.0);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{wikipedia|GLSL#Versions}}
* &lt;code&gt;#version 120&lt;/code&gt; means v1.20, the version of GLSL in OpenGL 2.1.
* OpenGL ''ES'' 2's GLSL is also based on GLSL v1.20, but its version is 1.00 (&lt;code&gt;#version 100&lt;/code&gt;).  &lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite web|url=http://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/specs/2.0/GLSL_ES_Specification_1.0.17.pdf |title=OpenGL ES Shading Language 1.0.17 Specification |publisher=Khronos.org |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2011-09-10}} - ''The OpenGL ES Shading Language (also known as GLSL ES or ESSL) is based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) version 1.20''&lt;/ref&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;coord2d&lt;/code&gt; is the current vertex; it's an input variable that we'll need to declare in our C code
* &lt;code&gt;gl_Position&lt;/code&gt; is the resulting screen position; it's a built-in output variable
* the &lt;code&gt;vec4&lt;/code&gt; takes our ''x'' and ''y'' coordinates, then &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; for the ''z'' coordinate. The last one, ''w''=&lt;code&gt;1.0&lt;/code&gt; is for homogeneous coordinates (used for [[../Modern_OpenGL_Tutorial_04|transformation matrices]]).

Now we need to make OpenGL compile this shader.  Start the &lt;code&gt;init_resources&lt;/code&gt; above &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/*
Function: init_resources
Receives: void
Returns: int
This function creates all GLSL related stuff
explained in this example.
Returns 1 when all is ok, 0 with a displayed error
*/
int init_resources(void)
{
  GLint compile_ok = GL_FALSE, link_ok = GL_FALSE;

  GLuint vs = glCreateShader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER);
  const char *vs_source = 
#ifdef GL_ES_VERSION_2_0
    &quot;#version 100\n&quot;  // OpenGL ES 2.0
#else
    &quot;#version 120\n&quot;  // OpenGL 2.1
#endif
    &quot;attribute vec2 coord2d;                  &quot;
    &quot;void main(void) {                        &quot;
    &quot;  gl_Position = vec4(coord2d, 0.0, 1.0); &quot;
    &quot;}&quot;;
  glShaderSource(vs, 1, &amp;vs_source, NULL);
  glCompileShader(vs);
  glGetShaderiv(vs, GL_COMPILE_STATUS, &amp;compile_ok);
  if (0 == compile_ok)
  {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error in vertex shader\n&quot;);
    return 0;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

We pass the source as a string to &lt;code&gt;glShaderSource&lt;/code&gt; (later we'll read the shader code differently and more conveniently).
We specify the type &lt;code&gt;GL_VERTEX_SHADER&lt;/code&gt;.

== Fragment shader ==

Once OpenGL has our 3 points screen position, it will fill the space between them to make a triangle.
For each of the pixels between the 3 points, it will call the fragment shader.  In our fragment shader, we'll tell that we want to color each pixel in blue:

&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
#version 120
void main(void) {
  gl_FragColor[0] = 0.0;
  gl_FragColor[1] = 0.0;
  gl_FragColor[2] = 1.0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

We compile it similarly, with type &lt;code&gt;GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER&lt;/code&gt;. Let's continue our &lt;code&gt;init_resources&lt;/code&gt; procedure:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  GLuint fs = glCreateShader(GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER);
  const char *fs_source =
    &quot;#version 120           \n&quot;
    &quot;void main(void) {        &quot;
    &quot;  gl_FragColor[0] = 0.0; &quot;
    &quot;  gl_FragColor[1] = 0.0; &quot;
    &quot;  gl_FragColor[2] = 1.0; &quot;
    &quot;}&quot;;
  glShaderSource(fs, 1, &amp;fs_source, NULL);
  glCompileShader(fs);
  glGetShaderiv(fs, GL_COMPILE_STATUS, &amp;compile_ok);
  if (!compile_ok) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error in fragment shader\n&quot;);
    return 0;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

== GLSL program ==

A GLSL program is the combination of the vertex and fragment shader. Usually they work together, and the vertex shader can even pass additional information to the fragment shader.

Create a global variable below &lt;code&gt;#include&lt;/code&gt; to store the program handle:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
GLuint program;
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is how to ''link'' the vertex and fragment shaders in a program. Continue our &lt;code&gt;init_resources&lt;/code&gt; procedure with:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  program = glCreateProgram();
  glAttachShader(program, vs);
  glAttachShader(program, fs);
  glLinkProgram(program);
  glGetProgramiv(program, GL_LINK_STATUS, &amp;link_ok);
  if (!link_ok) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;glLinkProgram:&quot;);
    return 0;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

== Pass the triangle vertices to the vertex shader ==

We mentioned that we pass each triangle vertex to the vertex shader using the &lt;code&gt;coord2d&lt;/code&gt; attribute.
Here is how to declare it in the C code.

First, let's create a second global variable:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
GLint attribute_coord2d;
&lt;/source&gt;

End our &lt;code&gt;init_resources&lt;/code&gt; procedure with:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  const char* attribute_name = &quot;coord2d&quot;;
  attribute_coord2d = glGetAttribLocation(program, attribute_name);
  if (attribute_coord2d == -1) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Could not bind attribute %s\n&quot;, attribute_name);
    return 0;
  }

  return 1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we can pass our triangle vertices to the vertex shader.
Let's write our &lt;code&gt;onDisplay&lt;/code&gt; procedure. Each section is explained in the comments:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void onDisplay()
{
  /* Clear the background as white */
  glClearColor(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
  glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

  glUseProgram(program);
  glEnableVertexAttribArray(attribute_coord2d);
  GLfloat triangle_vertices[] = {
     0.0,  0.8,
    -0.8, -0.8,
     0.8, -0.8,
  };
  /* Describe our vertices array to OpenGL (it can't guess its format automatically) */
  glVertexAttribPointer(
    attribute_coord2d, // attribute
    2,                 // number of elements per vertex, here (x,y)
    GL_FLOAT,          // the type of each element
    GL_FALSE,          // take our values as-is
    0,                 // no extra data between each position
    triangle_vertices  // pointer to the C array
  );

  /* Push each element in buffer_vertices to the vertex shader */
  glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 3);
  glDisableVertexAttribArray(attribute_coord2d);

  /* Display the result */
  glutSwapBuffers();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;glVertexAttribPointer&lt;/code&gt; tells OpenGL to retrieve each vertex from the data buffer created in &lt;code&gt;init_resources&lt;/code&gt; and pass it to the vertex shader.  These vertices define the on-screen position for each point, forming a triangle whose pixels are colored by the fragment shader.

Note: in the next tutorial we'll introduce Vertex Buffer Objects, a slightly more complex and newer way to store the vertices in the graphic card.

The only remaining part is &lt;code&gt;free_resources&lt;/code&gt;, to clean-up when we quit the program.
It's not critical in this particular case, but it's good to structure applications this way:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void free_resources()
{
  glDeleteProgram(program);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Our first OpenGL 2.0 program is complete!

= If this fails =

The next tutorial adds more robustness to our first, minimalist code.  Make sure to try the &lt;code&gt;tut02&lt;/code&gt; code (see link to code below).

= Experiment! =

[[File:OpenGL Tutorial Triangle2.png|thumb|Our first program, with another fragment shader]]

Feel free to experiment with this code:
* try to make a square by displaying 2 triangles
* try to change the colors
* read the OpenGL man pages for each function that we used:
** [http://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/docs/man/ OpenGL] (ES 2.0)
** [http://www.opengl.org/documentation/specs/glut/spec3/spec3.html GLUT]
* try to use this code in the fragment shader - what does it do?
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
gl_FragColor[0] = gl_FragCoord.x/640.0;
gl_FragColor[1] = gl_FragCoord.y/480.0;
gl_FragColor[2] = 0.5;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the next tutorial, we'll add a few utility functions to make it easier to write and debug shaders.

'''Imperial/Wilmington''' is one of four transfer stations in the Los Angeles County Metro Rail. It serves as the gateway from points along the Green Line (Norwalk, El Segundo) to Downtown LA (via the Blue Line). The station is also referred to as '''Rosa Parks'''.

== Station Basics ==
Imperial/Wilmington is the major transfer station on the Green Line, as it provides a free connection to the Metro Blue Line to Long Beach and Downtown LA. Passengers wishing to go to Pasadena, East LA, Downtown LA, Hollywood, or Long Beach by rail from any station on the Green Line will transfer at this station. Imperial/Wilmington is located at 11611 Willowbrook Av, Los Angeles, CA 90059. It has 975 parking spaces, 36 bike rack spaces, and 6 bike lockers, all free of charge. Connection to the Metro Blue Line is downstairs at street level. It is located at the intersection of I-105, Imperial Hwy, and Wilmington Ave. The station is one of the few light-rail stations with fare gates; the other stations still use the honor system.

== Floor Configuration ==
[[File:Rosa Parks station Los Angeles Metro 20080206.ogv|thumb|A view of a Metro Blue Line train entering Imperial/Wilmington station shot from inside the train.]]

Imperial/Wilmington Station is entirely above-ground, with two levels and one mezzazine.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Level !! Features
|-
| Street || Concourse (ticketing, gates), Blue Line
|-
| I-105 Level || Green Line
|}

=== Street Level ===
Access to both lines is located on the floor level. The only escalators and elevators to the Green Line are in the ticketed areas of the Street Level. The Blue Line platforms are also at street level.

=== Mezzazine ===
Since the Green Line is located on the I-105, far from street level, it would be too expensive for Metro to construct enough escalators or elevators to the I-105 level. Therefore, Metro built a mezzazine level between the two levels. There are two completely separate elevators and escalators.

The mezzazine is the smallest of all the levels. In fact, some escalators and elevators do not pass the mezzazine and direct reach street level.

=== I-105 Level ===
Located three stories above street level, the I-105 level contains only the platforms for the Green Line. Since the platform is right by the I-105, it is the noisiest of all the levels.

== Lines Covered ==
[[File:LACMTA-BlueLine.jpg|thumb|A Los Angeles-bound Blue Line train makes a stop at Imperial/Wilmington.]]

Imperial/Wilmington serves the Green and Blue Lines.

=== Blue Line ===
Imperial/Wilmington is linked to Downtown via 10 stations on the Blue Line. In the southerly direcion, the Blue Line links to Long Beach. This is the only Blue Line station in Willowbrook. Stations to the north include 103rd Street (near Watts Tower), Pico (near STAPLES Center), and 7th Street/Metro Center (terminus/connection to Red/Purple Lines). To the south are Compton and the Downtown Long Beach loop.

=== Green Line ===
Imperial/Wilmington is one of 10 stations along the I-105 Freeway (Century Freeway) and one of 13 stations that are along any freeway (the other 3 are on the Gold Line and along I-210). Trains connect to Norwalk on the west side and LAX and El Segundo on the east side. Going east, trains stop at Long Beach, Lakewood, and Norwalk. In the other direction, trains stop at Avalon, Harbor Freeway (connection to Silver Line BRT)...Aviation/LAX (free shuttle bus to LAX)...and Redondo Beach (terminus).

This is ''experimental'' documentation for a feature that is not in OpenSCAD, and may never be integrated into OpenSCAD. 

It would be added to [[OpenSCAD User Manual/STL Import and Export]]

----

=== import_stl ===

Imports an STL file for use in the current OpenSCAD model

'''Parameters'''

; '''&quot;'''&amp;lt;file name&amp;gt;'''&quot;''' : A string containing the path to the STL file to include. Double-quotes are required.

; convexity: Integer. The convexity parameter specifies the maximum number of front sides (back sides) a ray intersecting the object might penetrate. This parameter is only needed for correctly displaying the object in OpenCSG preview mode and has no effect on the polyhedron rendering.

; newsize: Vector. This allows you to set a new size for the STL object. For example &lt;code&gt;newsize=[10,0,0]&lt;/code&gt; would set the STL x direction to be 10 units in length, and y and z would be automatically scaled to match.

; autosize: Boolean. By setting this to false, the 'newsize' feature can leave a dimension as-is, without automatically rescaling it. For example, &lt;code&gt;newsize=[10,0,0], autosize=false&lt;/code&gt; would  change the x size of the STL to 10, but leave y and z as they are. 

'''Usage examples:'''
 
 import_stl(&quot;example012.stl&quot;, convexity = 5);

This imports the basic result of rendering OpenSCAD Example 12 into STL (with F6)

 import_stl(&quot;pencil.stl&quot;, newsize=[10,0,0]);  

This imports a pencil, but makes it 10 units in x. y and z are scaled to match.

 import_stl(&quot;pencil.stl&quot;, newsize=[100], autosize=false); 

This imports a pencil, but makes it 100 units in x. y and z are left as-is, so you can make a super-long stretched out pencil.

 import_stl(&quot;skyscraper.stl&quot;, newsize=[0,0,1000])

This imports a skyscraper.stl file, but makes it 1000 units tall (z), and scales x &amp; y to match.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Automating test data, range validation and content separation ==

The system described below is an extension to standard OpenClinica CRFs and attempts to make it easier for experienced OpenClinica developers to work with OpenClinica by automating and simplifying common tasks:
#Automate test data
#Automate range validation (and validation error messages) for numeric data
#Automate variable name uniqueness and length checking (to help avoid [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/CRFandOIDissues|OID issues]])
#Separate content from presentation in descriptions and left item names
#Present the CRF sheet at a reduced, but usable size on a single monitor
Then, either:
#You can manually enter the automatically generated test data into CRFs for testing
Or optionally:
#You can set up a Word merge to merge test data into a Word version of the paper CRF to test the system
#The Word merge also produces a marked-up CRF with code lists for data analysis

=== Contents of the system ===
# A Calculations spreadsheet with sheets named Calculations and Merge (separate from the main OpenClinica spreadsheet)
# Optionally, a Word version of the paper CRF to merge the test data into (using straightforward mail merge)

The data flows are:
# Calculations spreadsheet (item data on Calculations sheet)-&gt; OpenClinica spreadsheet
# Calculations spreadsheet (test data on Merge sheet) -&gt; either a Word CRF or a paper CRF

If multiple Openclinica CRFs are used to model a single paper CRFs, then an additiona spreadsheet (with up to 256 data points) can be used to merge the merge sheets prior to the Word merge.  If more than 256 points are needed, multiple Word merges must be done.

=== Downloadable documents ===

The example documents (for OpenClinica 3.1.2) below show the process detailed on this page:
#[https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BzfD9Kw8xaZbMTFmNGVkMTItNjQ2NC00NmYwLTkxMTMtMGNiYWRhMTdkYmEy Example OpenClinica CRF spreadsheet]
#[https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BzfD9Kw8xaZbYzA2NDczODgtMzJjNi00OGQ2LWE5YTAtZGY4YjQxZTgxYjFh Example Calculations spreadsheet]
#[https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0BzfD9Kw8xaZbNGNhNmFlOTgtMTkzYi00OGUyLWJiNmItZWM4ZWU5NDRjODNk&amp;hl=en_US Example Word CRF with merge fields and comments]

==== Advanced downloadable documents ====

If you have multiple OpenClinica CRFs representing a single paper CRF:
*[https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0BzfD9Kw8xaZbMTY3NjhiYWYtNDRmNC00ZTdlLWFjMGQtMGI3MmQzZjNjM2Nj&amp;hl=en_US Excel spreadsheet combining test data from multiple spreadsheets]

Extra detail on merging the data (in case you need it):
# [https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0BzfD9Kw8xaZbYTJmYjg4MmMtNDA5ZS00ZjZkLThiMTEtM2ZmYmJkM2VlNTAw&amp;hl=en_US Example CRF prior to inserting merge fields and coments]

== The Calculations spreadsheet ==

There are two sheets in the Calculations spreadsheet:
*The Calculations sheet contains formulae to calculate test data, range limits and error messages (amongst other things).
*The Merge sheet references the test data in the Calculations sheet and updates automatically

=== The Calculations sheet ===

[[File:Excel20110809a-large.png|720px]]

The sheet is most easily used with a wide screen, where the three main parts of the sheet can be visible at once.
The three main parts are:
#On the left, the content entry (in white), which forms the basis for the next two parts:
#In the centre, the automatic test data (in orange and green) and:
#On the right, the CRF code (in yellow)
#Off-screen most of the time, the Error check section (pink) checks for errors

As you enter data in the Content Entry area, the test data is generated in the centre, and the values that OpenClinica needs are generated on the right.  When you have finished entering data, you need to copy and paste as values the right (yellow) section from the Calculations sheet to the Items sheet in the OpenClinica spreadsheet before uploading it to OpenClinica.

The Error check section, hidden off-screen section that catches if ITEM_NAMES aren't unique and don't exceed a certain length (specified above the column).  If an error is found, the title cell of that row is highlighted in red (scroll across to see the error)

==== Fields that differ from regular OpenClinica usage ====
* Title: Used as the basis for DESCRIPTION and LEFT_ITEM_TEXT.
* Short Name: Generally capitalised, with the addition of Prefix (below), this is directly translated to ITEM_NAME
* Prefix: A two letter prefix for the Short Name (see CDISC's CDASH for possible values)
* Min: The minimum test value acceptable.  Used to automatically populate the test data section and the fields: RESPONSE_TYPE, RESPONSE_LABEL, DATA_TYPE, WIDTH_DECIMAL, VALIDATION and VALIDATION_ERROR_MESSAGE.  Date test values should be entered as string literals (preceded by quote characters, e.g. '24 Apr 2011)
* Max: Same as the field above, but this is the maximum test value acceptable.
* Decimal places/DATE: Helps define the DATA_TYPE and WIDTH_DECIMAL.  Possible values are ST, DAT, a positive integer or empty (equivalent to 0)
* Validation Override: If you would prefer to have a regexp validation for a field, rather than a range, you can specify the regexp here.
* Message Override: If you have overridden the validation (in the above Validation Override), specify the message you want to appear when the regexp is triggered
* Extra text under: Text that should appear under a field (appended to description as an additional paragraph)
* Extra text right: Text that should appear to the right of a field
* Section - synonym for SECTION_LABEL, except that you only need to mark the start of sections

==== Fields that are used identically to OpenClinica ====
* Group: synonym for GROUP_LABEL
* Units: as UNITS
* Col: synonym for COLUMN_NUMBER
* Page Number: synonym for PAGE_NUMBER
* Question: synonym for QUESTION_NUMBER
* RESPONSE_TYPE
* RESPONSE_LABEL
* RESPONSE_OPTIONS_TEXT
* RESPONSE_VALUES_OR_CALCULATIONS
* RESPONSE_LAYOUT
* DEFAULT_VALUE
* Req: synonym for REQUIRED
* Extra text right: synonym for RIGHT_ITEM_TEXT
* Header: as HEADER

Some fields are used infrequently, a manual change could be used when they need to be modified (don't forget to highlight this modification with formatting): SUBHEADER, PARENT_ITEM, PHI

==== What to copy ====
In the calculations sheet, select all yellow cells from row C to the last entry with a valid item name

[[File:Excel copying.png|720px]] 

==== Where to paste (as values) ====
In the Items sheet of the OpenClinica spreadsheet, select cell B1 and then paste as values

[[File:Excel pasting.png|720px]] 

==== The separation of presentation and content as it appears in OpenClinica ====
The text under 'Test item 3' was entered as plain text in the 'Extra text under' column.

[[File:Test separation of presentation and content.png]]

=== Maintaining the sheet ===
* As the white editable sections aren't protected, avoid dragging and dropping, or cutting and pasting to move cells there.  Instead, use copy and paste, then delete old data
* If more than 256 rows are needed, the numbers of rows in the sheet can be extended by selecting the lowest row and filling rows further down the spreadsheet (see [http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/fill-data-automatically-in-worksheet-cells-HP001216366.aspx The Microsoft Excel Fill reference]) after unprotecting the sheet.
* Formulae can be repaired by dragging and filling

=== What this sheet doesn't help you do ===
#It doesn't create complex test data, sometimes you have to override specific cells - format them differently so that they aren't altered accidentally
#It doesn't update the Section, Group or other sheets
#It doesn't create test data for all possible select values, only the extrema
#It doesn't create a test plan, either to test itself or to test rules or calculations

==== Updating the date of the test visit ====

The merge sheet has a manually entered '1 Visit date' column, where the date of the visit can be updated.

== Merging the data into the Word CRF ==
#Before trying to merge data, ensure that the topmost sheet in your test data workbook contains the data you wish to import (you may need to resave your workbook).
#Open your Word CRF.
#In Word 2010, select the Mailings tab, and click 'Select Recipients', then 'Use Existing List' and select the test data workbook.
#When you are prompted for the data source, click 'Show All', and select 'MS Excel Worksheets via DDE (*.xls)'.  DDE prevents accuracy issues with floating point numbers, where numbers such as 1.99 are displayed as 1.989999999 on merge.

[[File:Selecting excel files via dde.png]]

If not already available as a data source type, DDE may need to be enabled.  For example, in Word 2010, click File, Options, then select Advanced, and in the General section, tick the 'Confirm file formation conversion on open' checkbox.

=== Limitations of Word merge ===
Up to 256 fields are available to Word's merge facility (see [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/294688 How to design and set up a mail merge address list in Word]), so if you have more than 256 data points, you will have to merge multiple workbooks into multiple CRFs.

=== Insert merge fields throughout the CRF ===
Open the example CRF document (above) to see examples of how merge fields appear.
[[File:Insert merge field.png|720px]]

=== Where necessary, use rules to replace items such as checkboxes ===
You can use Xs and Os to represent checked and unchecked tickboxes from paper CRFs.

[[File:Word merge rules.png|720px]]

Use mail merge preview to check your fields are working correctly.

=== To aid data analysis, you may want to mark up the document where rules have been used to highlight codelists ===
Add balloon comments to mark-up the document.
[[File:Word with comments.png|720px]]

* To print the test data for data entry, hide the comments when printing, and perform a mail merge.
* The unmerged CRF works as a marked-up CRF for a data analyst

== Merging test data from multiple workbooks for a single CRF ==
Word merge only takes a single, wide spreadsheet as input, so you may need to combine test data from the individual CRF workbooks.  In this spreadsheet, data is collected as vertical columns, then transposed to rows for the Word merge.
#First, create sheets in the 'test data.xlsx' workbook, and create references to the test data in the Calculations sheet of each of your OpenClinica CRFs.
#Second, in the 'Combined' sheet, create dates for your visits, then transpose the data from the sheets
As test data in the OpenClinica CRFs is updated, the 'test data.xlsx' will also automatically update

=== Adding references to CRF workbooks in the 'test data.xlsx' workbook ===
Create sheets in the 'test data.xlsx' workbook for each CRF, then create references to the ItemName column and test data columns.  See the 'Test data.xlsx' spreadsheet for examples.
The data should look like this:
	
[[File:Selecting data for transpose.png]]

=== Transposing the CRF sheets to the Combined sheet ===
#Switch to the Combined sheet and in the first blank cell on the top line start entering this formula '=TRANSPOSE('.
#Switch to the CRF sheet, select the data to transpose, then close the brackets of the formula.
#Your formula should look like this: '=TRANSPOSE('1 Visit'!A1:G10)'
#Switch back to the Combined sheet, starting at the cell containing the formula you have just entered, select a destination area that is as wide as the source is long and is as long as the source is wide.
[[File:Prior to transpose.png|720px]]
#To transpose, select the area, then press F2, then CTRL-SHIFT-Return
[[File:Transpose applied.png|720px]]

Repeat this for all available CRFs.

Finally: When saving, please select the Combined sheet to be topmost.  The Test Data workbook should now update as the CRFs updates.

== Ideas for Future Improvements ==

* The calculations and merge sheets are currently stored in a separate spreadsheet, in an effort to keep this data separate from the data that OpenClinica sees.  If we could be sure that OpenClinica wasn't affected by these additional sheets we could use a single CRF.  Further, if the Items sheet could include calculations (which it currently can't), then the items sheet could just be references to the Calculations sheet, and no copying/pasting would be necessary
* Codelists (RESPONSE_LABELS and RESPONSE_OPTIONS) could be stored in a separate sheet, and the codelists could be included by using a simple text reference.
* The Required field could be amended to simulate rules, with a reference to other fields that trigger whether the test data is required, and with what value (e.g. when field A is 1, then the test data should be required).

Thanks for the interest on the C++ Programming book, I noticed on part of the last addition to the work, specifically in the [[C%2B%2B_Programming/Code/IO#.E2.80.8ERounding_number_example|Rounding number example]] there is a copyright issue. I understand that you probably are aware of it but not in the implications of adding it to the book text (print version, we could create for instance a source code companion to be downloaded, from sourceforge or something like it) but in print the requirement added is contrary to our copyright policy &quot;Please note that this Copyright notice has to remain intact!&quot;, It would be fine if we could simply acknowledge the source in the authors page but this &quot;license&quot; strictly requires the preservation of the notice at location. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:37, 7 August 2012 (UTC)

== [[Java Programming/Methods]] ==

Hi,

Thank you for contributing, the Variable Argument needs to be explained. Actually, this point has been described [[Java Programming/Generics#Variable Argument|here]] but it is misplaced. I think I will move this [[Java Programming/Variable Argument|here]]. I don't know in which chapter it should be but this subject is not a ''fundamental'' subject. I also have some advices:
* For your explanations, create code snippets that are as shorter as possible. Only add the necessary content to understand the point.
* You can use highlighting to spotlight the most important part of code. It highlights in yellow the code lines. Currently, the highlights in [[Java Programming/Methods#code-listing-11|Code listing 3.98]] is highlighting the line 5 and 8.

[[File:Filippo Brunelleschi, cutaway of the Dome of Florence Cathedral (Santa Maria del Fiore).JPG|198px|thumb|left|Cutaway drawing of the dome of the Florence cathedral by Filippo Brunelleschi, 1414-36.]]
This tutorial covers '''discarding fragments''', determining whether the front face or back face is rendered, and '''front-face culling'''. This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with varying variables as discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/RGB Cube|tutorial on a RGB cube]].

The main theme of this tutorial is to cut away triangles or fragments even though they are part of a mesh that is being rendered. The main two reasons are: we want to look through a triangle or fragment (as in the case of the roof in the drawing to the left, which is only partly cut away) or we know that a triangle isn't visible anyways; thus, we can save some performance by not processing it. OpenGL supports these situations in several ways; we will discuss two of them. 

===Very Cheap Cutaways===
The following shader is a very cheap way of cutting away parts of a mesh: all fragments are cut away that have a positive &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; coordinate in object coordinates (i.e. in the coordinate system in which it was modeled; see [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Vertex Transformations|“Vertex Transformations”]] for details about coordinate systems). Here is the vertex shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec4 position_in_object_coordinates;
 
         void main()
         {
            position_in_object_coordinates= gl_Vertex;
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
&lt;/source&gt;
And here is the fragment shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;       
         varying vec4 position_in_object_coordinates;

         void main()
         {
            if (position_in_object_coordinates.y &gt; 0.0) 
            {
               discard; // stop processing the fragment 
                  // if y coordinate is positive
            }
            if (gl_FrontFacing) // are we looking at a front face?
            {
               gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0); // yes: green
            }
            else
            {
               gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0); // no: red
            }
         }
&lt;/source&gt;         
When you apply this shader to any of the default objects, the shader will cut away half of them. This is a very cheap way of producing hemispheres or open cylinders. You will also notice that the “inside” of the object is invisible. This is due to back-face culling, which we discuss further below.

===Discarding Fragments===
Let's first focus on the &lt;code&gt;discard&lt;/code&gt; instruction in the fragment shader. This instruction basically just discards the processed fragment. (This was called a fragment “kill” in earlier shading languages; I can understand that the fragments prefer the term “discard”.) Depending on the hardware, this can be a quite expensive technique in the sense that rendering might perform considerably worse as soon as there is one shader that includes a &lt;code&gt;discard&lt;/code&gt; instruction (regardless of how many fragments are actually discarded, just the presence of the instruction may result in the deactivation of some important optimizations). Therefore, you should avoid this instruction whenever possible but in particular when you run into performance problems.

One more note: the condition for the fragment &lt;code&gt;discard&lt;/code&gt; includes only an object coordinate. The consequence is that you can rotate and move the object in any way and the cutaway part will always rotate and move with the object. You might want to check what cutting in view or world space looks like: change the vertex and fragment shader such that the view coordinate &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; or world coordinate &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is used in the condition for the fragment &lt;code&gt;discard&lt;/code&gt;. Tip: see the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Shading in View Space|tutorial on shading in view space]] for how to transform the vertex into world space.

===Better Cutaways===
You might try the following idea to improve the shader: change it such that fragments are discarded if the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; coordinate is greater than some threshold variable. Then introduce a game property to allow the user to control this threshold. Tip: see the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Shading in View Space|tutorial on shading in view space]] for a discussion of game properties.

===Back-Face Culling===
By default, the Blender game engine only renders front faces because the inside of objects is usually invisible; thus, back-face culling can save quite some performance by avoiding to rasterize these triangles. This is achieved as follows: Triangles and vertices are processed as usual. However, after the viewport transformation of the vertices to screen coordinates (see [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Vertex Transformations|“Vertex Transformations”]]) the graphics processor determines whether the vertices of a triangle appear in counter-clockwise order or in clockwise order on the screen. Based on this test, each triangle is considered a front-facing or a back-facing triangle. If it is back-facing and culling is activated it will be discarded, i.e., the processing of it stops and it is not rasterized. 

However, we are able to see the inside with our shader because we have discarded some fragments; thus, we should deactivate back-face culling. In Blender 2.6, you should first set the render engine to '''Blender Game''' in the '''Info window'''. Then select an object in the '''3D View''' and in a '''Properties window''' open the '''Material tab''' and make sure that the object has a material. Under '''Game Settings''' in the '''Material tab''' you can then deactivate '''Backface Culling'''. With the shader from above, the back faces should now appear in red.

===Distinguishing between Front and Back Faces===
As demonstrated by the shader, a special boolean variable &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontFacing&lt;/code&gt; is available in the fragment shader that specifies whether we are looking at the front face of a triangle. Usually, the front faces are facing the outside of a mesh and the back faces the inside. (Just as the surface normal vector usually points to the outside.) However, the actual way front and back faces are distinguished is the order of the vertices in a triangle: if the camera sees the vertices of a triangle in counter-clockwise order, it sees the front face. If it sees the vertices in clockwise order, it sees the back face. 

Our fragment shader checks the variable &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontFacing&lt;/code&gt; and assigns green to the output fragment color if &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontFacing&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. the fragment is part of a front-facing triangle; i.e. it is facing the outside), and red if &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontFacing&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. the fragment is part of a back-facing triangle; i.e. it is facing the inside). In fact, &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontFacing&lt;/code&gt; allows you not only to render the two faces of a surfaces with different colors but with completely different styles.

Note that basing the definition of front and back faces on the order of vertices in a triangle can cause problems when vertices are mirrored, i.e. scaled with a negative factor. Blender tries to take care of these problems; thus, just specifying a negative scaling in the Transform parameters of the object will usually not cause this problem. However, since Blender has no control over what we are doing in the vertex shader, we can still turn the inside out by multiplying one (or three) of the coordinates with -1, e.g. by assigning &lt;code&gt;gl_Position&lt;/code&gt; this way in the vertex shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix 
            * vec4(-gl_Vertex.x, gl_Vertex.y, gl_Vertex.z, 1.0);
&lt;/source&gt;
This just multiplies the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; coordinate by -1. For a sphere, you might think that nothing happens, but it actually turns front faces into back faces and vice versa; thus, now the inside is green and the outside is red. (By the way, this problem also affects the surface normal vector.) Thus, be careful with mirrors!

===Summary===
Congratulations, you have worked through another tutorial. (If you have tried one of the assignments: good job! I didn't yet.) We have looked at:
* How to discard fragments.
* How to deactivate the default culling of back faces.
* How to render front-facing and back-facing triangles in different colors.

[[File:1873 Pierre Auguste Cot - Spring.jpg|250px|thumb|right|«Le Printemps» by Pierre Auguste Cot, 1873. Note the transparent clothing.]]
This tutorial covers '''blending''' of fragments (i.e. compositing them) using GLSL shaders in Blender. It assumes that you are familiar with the concept of front and back faces as discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Cutaways|tutorial on cutaways]].

More specifically, this tutorial is about '''rendering transparent objects''', e.g. transparent glass, plastic, fabrics, etc. (More strictly speaking, these are actually semitransparent objects because they don't need to be perfectly transparent.) Transparent objects allow us to see through them; thus, their color “blends” whith the color of whatever is behind them. 

=== Blending ===
As mentioned in the description of the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/OpenGL ES 2.0 Pipeline|“OpenGL ES 2.0 Pipeline”]], the fragment shader computes an RGBA color (i.e. red, green, blue, and alpha components in &lt;code&gt;gl_FragColor&lt;/code&gt;) for each fragment (unless the fragment is discarded). The fragments are then processed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Per-Fragment Operations|“Per-Fragment Operations”]]. One of them is the blending stage, which combines the color of the fragment (as specified in &lt;code&gt;gl_FragColor&lt;/code&gt;), which is called the “source color”, with the color of the corresponding pixel that is already in the framebuffer, which is called the “destination color” (because the “destination” of the resulting blended color is the framebuffer). 

Blending is a fixed-function stage, i.e. you can customize it but not program it. The way it is customized, is by specifying a '''blend equation'''. You can think of the blend equation as this definition of the resulting RGBA color:

&lt;code&gt;vec4 result = SrcFactor * gl_FragColor + DstFactor * pixel_color;&lt;/code&gt; 

where &lt;code&gt;pixel_color&lt;/code&gt; is the RGBA color that is currently in the framebuffer and &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; is the blended result, i.e. the output of the blending stage. &lt;code&gt;SrcFactor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DstFactor&lt;/code&gt; are customizable RGBA colors (of type &lt;code&gt;vec4&lt;/code&gt;) that are multiplied component-wise with the fragment color and the pixel color. The values of &lt;code&gt;SrcFactor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DstFactor&lt;/code&gt; are specified in Blender's Python API with this function:

&lt;code&gt;bge.types.KX_BlenderMaterial.setBlending(&lt;/code&gt;{code for &lt;code&gt;SrcFactor&lt;/code&gt;},{code for &lt;code&gt;DstFactor&lt;/code&gt;}&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

The possible codes for the two factors are summarized in the following table (see also the [http://www.blender.org/documentation/blender_python_api_2_62_release/bge.logic.html#blender-material Blender documentation]):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Code!! Resulting Factor (&lt;code&gt;SrcFactor&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;DstFactor&lt;/code&gt;)
|-
|&lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_ONE&lt;/code&gt;	|| &lt;code&gt;vec4(1.0)&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_ZERO&lt;/code&gt;	|| &lt;code&gt;vec4(0.0)&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_SRC_COLOR&lt;/code&gt;	|| &lt;code&gt;gl_FragColor&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_SRC_ALPHA&lt;/code&gt;	|| &lt;code&gt;vec4(gl_FragColor.a)&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_DST_COLOR&lt;/code&gt;	|| &lt;code&gt;pixel_color&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_DST_ALPHA&lt;/code&gt;	|| &lt;code&gt;vec4(pixel_color.a)&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_COLOR&lt;/code&gt;	|| &lt;code&gt;vec4(1.0) - gl_FragColor&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA&lt;/code&gt;	|| &lt;code&gt;vec4(1.0 - gl_FragColor.a)&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_ONE_MINUS_DST_COLOR&lt;/code&gt;	|| &lt;code&gt;vec4(1.0) - pixel_color&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA&lt;/code&gt;	|| &lt;code&gt;vec4(1.0 - pixel_color.a)&lt;/code&gt;
|}

As discussed in [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Vector and Matrix Operations|“Vextor and Matrix Operations”]], &lt;code&gt;vec4(1.0)&lt;/code&gt; is just a short way of writing &lt;code&gt;vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)&lt;/code&gt;. Also note that all components of all colors and factors in the blend equation are clamped between 0 and 1.

=== Alpha Blending ===

One specific example for a blend equation is called “alpha blending”. In Blender it is specified this way:

&lt;code&gt;mat.setBlending(bge.logic.BL_SRC_ALPHA, bge.logic.BL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;mat&lt;/code&gt; is a material of type &lt;code&gt;bge.types.KX_BlenderMaterial&lt;/code&gt; (see the [http://www.blender.org/documentation/blender_python_api_2_62_release/bge.types.html#bge.types.KX_BlenderMaterial Blender documentation]; for the complete code, see below). This sets &lt;code&gt;SrcFactor&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;vec4(gl_FragColor.a)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DstFactor&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;vec4(1.0 - gl_FragColor.a)&lt;/code&gt;. Thus the blend equation becomes:

&lt;code&gt;vec4 result = vec4(gl_FragColor.a) * gl_FragColor + vec4(1.0 - gl_FragColor.a) * pixel_color;&lt;/code&gt; 

This uses the alpha component of &lt;code&gt;gl_FragColor&lt;/code&gt; as an '''opacity'''. I.e. the more opaque the fragment color is, the larger its opacity and therefore its alpha component, and thus the more of the fragment color is mixed in the result and the less of the pixel color in the framebuffer.  A perfectly opaque fragment color (i.e. with an alpha component of 1) will completely replace the pixel color. 

This blend equation is sometimes referred to as an “over” operation, i.e. “&lt;code&gt;gl_FragColor&lt;/code&gt; over &lt;code&gt;pixel_color&lt;/code&gt;”, since it corresponds to putting a semitransparent layer of the fragment color with a specific opacity on top of the pixel color. (Think of a layer of colored glass or colored semitransparent plastic on top of something of another color.)

Due to the popularity of alpha blending, the alpha component of a color is often called opacity even if alpha blending is not employed. Moreover, note that in computer graphics a common formal definition of the '''transparency''' of a color is '''1 − opacity''' of that color.

=== Premultiplied Alpha Blending ===

There is an important variant of alpha blending: sometimes the fragment color has its alpha component already premultiplied to the color components. (You might think of it as a price that has VAT already included.) In this case, alpha should not be multiplied again (VAT should not be added again) and the correct blending is:

&lt;code&gt;mat.setBlending(bge.logic.BL_ONE, bge.logic.BL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)&lt;/code&gt;

which corresponds to:

&lt;code&gt;vec4 result = vec4(1.0) * gl_FragColor + vec4(1.0 - gl_FragColor.a) * pixel_color;&lt;/code&gt; 

=== Additive Blending ===

Another example for a blending equation is:

&lt;code&gt;mat.setBlending(bge.logic.BL_ONE, bge.logic.BL_ONE)&lt;/code&gt;

This corresponds to:

&lt;code&gt;vec4 result = vec4(1.0) * gl_FragColor + vec4(1.0) * pixel_color;&lt;/code&gt; 

which just adds the fragment color to the color in the framebuffer. Note that the alpha component is not used at all; nonetheless, this blending equation is very useful for many kinds of transparent effects; for example, it is often used for particle systems when they represent fire or something else that is transparent and emits light. Additive blending is discussed in more detail in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Order-Independent Transparency|tutorial on order-independent transparency]].

=== Shader Code ===

Here is a simple shader which uses alpha blending with a green color with opacity 0.3. Note that you have to set the '''Viewport Shading''' to '''Texture''' in the menu of the '''3D View''' for blending to be active.
  
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
import bge

cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()

VertexShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
         void main()
         {
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }

&quot;&quot;&quot;

FragmentShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.3); 
               // fourth component (alpha) is important: 
               // this is semitransparent green
         }
&quot;&quot;&quot;

mesh = cont.owner.meshes[0]
for mat in mesh.materials:
    shader = mat.getShader()
    if shader != None:
        if not shader.isValid():
            shader.setSource(VertexShader, FragmentShader, 1)
            mat.setBlending(bge.logic.BL_SRC_ALPHA, 
                            bge.logic.BL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)
&lt;/source&gt;

Usually, semitransparent meshes should be rendered with deactivated writing to the depth buffer after all the opaque meshes were rendered. In this way, none of the fragments of opaque objects (which should shine through semitransparent objects) will fail the depth test because of a semitransparent object in front of it. (The depth test is discussed in the section on the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Per-Fragment Operations|“Per-Fragment Operations”]].) In order to activate this technique in Blender, you have to select the object in the '''3D View''' and then go to a '''Properties window''' and choose the '''Material tab'''. Create a new material if you haven't yet. In the '''Material tab''' check '''Transparency''' and select '''Z Transparency'''. 

This setting should also render triangles sorted from back to front. This is necessary because rendering transparent meshes with deactivated writing to the depth buffer does not always solve all problems. It works perfectly if the order in which fragments are blended does not matter; for example, if the fragment color is just added to the pixel color in the framebuffer with additive blending, the order in which fragments are blended is not important; see the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Order-Independent Transparency|tutorial on order-independent transparency]]. However, for other blending equations, e.g. alpha blending, the result will be different depending on the order in which fragments are blended. (If you look through almost opaque green glass at almost opaque red glass you will mainly see green, while you will mainly see red if you look through almost opaque red glass at almost opaque green glass. Similarly, blending almost opaque green color over almost opaque red color will be different from blending almost opaque red color over almost opaque green color.) In order to avoid artifacts, '''Z Transparency''' renders triangles from back to front. An alternative is to use additive blending or (premultiplied) alpha blending with small opacities (in which case the destination factor &lt;code&gt;DstFactor&lt;/code&gt; is close to 1 and therefore alpha blending is close to additive blending).

=== Including Back Faces ===
The previous shader doesn't render the “inside” of the object. However, since we can see through the outside of a transparent object, we should also render the inside. As discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Cutaways|tutorial on cutaways]], the inside can be rendered by deactivating back-face culling. However, if we just deactivate culling, we might get in trouble: as discussed above, it often matters in which order transparent fragments are rendered but without any culling, overlapping triangles from the inside and the outside might be rendered in a random order which can lead to annoying rendering artifacts. Therefore, it is important to activate sorting of triangles by selecting '''Z Transparency''' as described in the previous section. 

===Summary===
Congratulations, you made it through this tutorial! One interesting thing about rendering transparent objects is that it isn't just about blending but also requires knowledge about back-face culling and the depth buffer. Specifically, we have looked at:
* What blending is and how it is specified in Blender.
* How a scene with transparent and opaque objects is rendered.

This tutorial covers '''order-independent blending'''. 

It continues the discussion of the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Transparency|tutorial on transparency]] and solves some problems of standard transparency. If you haven't read that tutorial, you should read it first.

=== Order-Independent Blending ===
As noted in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Transparency|tutorial on transparency]], the result of blending often (in particular for standard alpha blending) depends on the order in which triangles are rendered and therefore results in rendering artifacts if the triangles are not sorted from back to front (which they usually aren't). The term “order-independent transparency” describes various techniques to avoid this problem. One of these techniques is order-independent blending, i.e. the use of a blend equation that does not depend on the order in which triangles are rasterized. There two basic possibilities: additive blending and multiplicative blending.

==== Additive Blending ====
The standard example for additive blending are double exposures as in the images on this page: colors are added such that it is impossible (or at least very hard) to say in which order the photos were taken. Additive blending can be characterized in terms of the blend equation introduced in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Transparency|tutorial on transparency]]:

&lt;code&gt;vec4 result = SrcFactor * gl_FragColor + DstFactor * pixel_color;&lt;/code&gt; 

where &lt;code&gt;SrcFactor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DstFactor&lt;/code&gt; are set by a function of Blender's Python API:

&lt;code&gt;bge.types.KX_BlenderMaterial.setBlending(&lt;/code&gt;{code for &lt;code&gt;SrcFactor&lt;/code&gt;},{code for &lt;code&gt;DstFactor&lt;/code&gt;}&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

For additive blending, the code for &lt;code&gt;DstFactor&lt;/code&gt; has to be &lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_ONE&lt;/code&gt; and the code for &lt;code&gt;SrcFactor&lt;/code&gt; must not depend on the pixel color in the framebuffer; i.e., it can be &lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_ONE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_SRC_COLOR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_SRC_ALPHA&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_COLOR&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA&lt;/code&gt;.

An example is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
import bge

cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()

VertexShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
         void main()
         {
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }

&quot;&quot;&quot;

FragmentShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3); 
         }
&quot;&quot;&quot;

mesh = cont.owner.meshes[0]
for mat in mesh.materials:
    shader = mat.getShader()
    if shader != None:
        if not shader.isValid():
            shader.setSource(VertexShader, FragmentShader, 1)
            mat.setBlending(bge.logic.BL_SRC_ALPHA, bge.logic.BL_ONE)
&lt;/source&gt;
Remember that you have to set '''Viewport Shading''' to '''Texture''' in the menu of a '''3D View''' in order to activate blending. Also, you should activate '''Z Transparency''' and deactivate '''Backface Culling''' as described in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Transparency|tutorial on transparency]]. 

==== Multiplicative Blending ====
An example for multiplicative blending in photography is the use of multiple uniform grey filters: the order in which the filters are put onto a camera doesn't matter for the resulting attenuation of the image. In terms of the rasterization of triangles, the image corresponds to the contents of the framebuffer before the triangles are rasterized, while the filters correspond to the triangles.  

When specifying mutiplicative blending in Python with 

&lt;code&gt;bge.types.KX_BlenderMaterial.setBlending(&lt;/code&gt;{code for &lt;code&gt;SrcFactor&lt;/code&gt;},{code for &lt;code&gt;DstFactor&lt;/code&gt;}&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

the code for &lt;code&gt;SrcFactor&lt;/code&gt; has to be &lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_ZERO&lt;/code&gt; and the code for &lt;code&gt;DstFactor&lt;/code&gt; must depend on the fragment color; i.e., it can be &lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_SRC_COLOR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_SRC_ALPHA&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_COLOR&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA&lt;/code&gt;. A typical example for attenuating the background with the opacity specified by the alpha component of fragments would use &lt;code&gt;bge.logic.BL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA&lt;/code&gt; for the code for &lt;code&gt;DstFactor&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
import bge

cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()

VertexShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
         void main()
         {
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }

&quot;&quot;&quot;

FragmentShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
         void main()
         {
            gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3); 
         }
&quot;&quot;&quot;

mesh = cont.owner.meshes[0]
for mat in mesh.materials:
    shader = mat.getShader()
    if shader != None:
        if not shader.isValid():
            shader.setSource(VertexShader, FragmentShader, 1)
            mat.setBlending(bge.logic.BL_ZERO, 
                            bge.logic.BL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now that we have a working example that we understand, we can start adding new features and more robustness to it.

Our previous shader was intentionally minimal so it's as easy as possible, but real-world example use more auxiliary code.


= Managing shaders =

== Loading shaders ==

The first thing to add is a more convenient way to load shaders: it would be much easier for us to load an external file (rather than copy paste it as a C string in our code). In addition, this will allow us to modify the GLSL code without recompiling the C code!

First, we need a function to load a file as string.
It's basic C code, it reads a file's contents into an allocated buffer of the size of the file.
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
/**
 * Store all the file's contents in memory, useful to pass shaders
 * source code to OpenGL
 */
/* Problem:
 *  We should close the input file before the return NULL; statements but this would lead to a lot of repetition (DRY)
 *   -you could solve this by using goto or by abusing switch/for/while + break or by building an if else mess
 *  better solution: let the user handle the File: char* file_read(const FILE* input)
*/
char* file_read(const char* filename)
{
  FILE* input = fopen(filename, &quot;rb&quot;);
  if(input == NULL) return NULL;
  
  if(fseek(input, 0, SEEK_END) == -1) return NULL;
  long size = ftell(input);
  if(size == -1) return NULL;
  if(fseek(input, 0, SEEK_SET) == -1) return NULL;
  	
  /*if using c-compiler: dont cast malloc's return value*/
  char *content = (char*) malloc( (size_t) size +1  ); 
  if(content == NULL) return NULL;
  
  fread(content, 1, (size_t)size, input);
  if(ferror(input)) {
    free(content);
    return NULL;
  }

  fclose(input);
  content[size] = '\0';
  return content;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Debugging shaders ==

Currently if there's an error in our shaders, the program just stops without explaining what error in particular.
We can get more information from OpenGL using the ''infolog'':

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/**
 * Display compilation errors from the OpenGL shader compiler
 */
void print_log(GLuint object)
{
  GLint log_length = 0;
  if (glIsShader(object))
    glGetShaderiv(object, GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH, &amp;log_length);
  else if (glIsProgram(object))
    glGetProgramiv(object, GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH, &amp;log_length);
  else {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;printlog: Not a shader or a program\n&quot;);
    return;
  }

  char* log = (char*)malloc(log_length);

  if (glIsShader(object))
    glGetShaderInfoLog(object, log_length, NULL, log);
  else if (glIsProgram(object))
    glGetProgramInfoLog(object, log_length, NULL, log);

  fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s&quot;, log);
  free(log);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Abstracting differences between OpenGL and GLES2 ==

When you only use GLES2 functions, your application is nearly portable to both desktops and mobile devices.
There are still a couple issues to address:
* The GLSL &lt;code&gt;#version&lt;/code&gt; is different
* GLES2 requires precision hints that are not compatible with OpenGL 2.1.

The &lt;code&gt;#version&lt;/code&gt; needs to be the very first line in some GLSL compilers (for instance on the PowerVR SGX540), so we cannot use &lt;code&gt;#ifdef&lt;/code&gt; directives to abstract it in the GLSL shader. Instead, we'll prepend the version in the C++ code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  const GLchar* sources[2] = {
#ifdef GL_ES_VERSION_2_0
    &quot;#version 100\n&quot;
    // Note: OpenGL ES automatically defines this:
    // #define GL_ES
#else
    &quot;#version 120\n&quot;,
#endif
    source };
  glShaderSource(res, 2, sources, NULL);
&lt;/source&gt;
Since we use the same version of GLSL in all our tutorials, this is the most simple solution.

We'll cover &lt;code&gt;#ifdef&lt;/code&gt; and precisions hints in the next section.

== A reusable function to create shaders ==

With these new utility functions and knowledge, we can make another function to load and debug a shader:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/**
 * Compile the shader from file 'filename', with error handling
 */
GLuint create_shader(const char* filename, GLenum type)
{
  const GLchar* source = file_read(filename);
  if (source == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error opening %s: &quot;, filename); perror(&quot;&quot;);
    return 0;
  }
  GLuint res = glCreateShader(type);
  const GLchar* sources[2] = {
#ifdef GL_ES_VERSION_2_0
    &quot;#version 100\n&quot;
    &quot;#define GLES2\n&quot;,
#else
    &quot;#version 120\n&quot;,
#endif
    source };
  glShaderSource(res, 2, sources, NULL);
  free((void*)source);

  glCompileShader(res);
  GLint compile_ok = GL_FALSE;
  glGetShaderiv(res, GL_COMPILE_STATUS, &amp;compile_ok);
  if (compile_ok == GL_FALSE) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s:&quot;, filename);
    print_log(res);
    glDeleteShader(res);
    return 0;
  }

  return res;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

We now can compile our shaders using simply:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  GLuint vs, fs;
  if ((vs = create_shader(&quot;triangle.v.glsl&quot;, GL_VERTEX_SHADER))   == 0) return 0;
  if ((fs = create_shader(&quot;triangle.f.glsl&quot;, GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER)) == 0) return 0;
&lt;/source&gt;
as well as display link errors:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  if (!link_ok) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;glLinkProgram:&quot;);
    print_log(program);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Place the new functions in a separate file ==

We place these new functions in &lt;code&gt;shader_utils.cpp&lt;/code&gt;.

Note that we intend to write as few of these functions as possible: the OpenGL Wikibook's goal is to understand how
OpenGL works, not how to use a toolkit that we develop.

Let's create a &lt;code&gt;shader_utils.h&lt;/code&gt; header file:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#ifndef _CREATE_SHADER_H
#define _CREATE_SHADER_H
#include &lt;GL/glew.h&gt;
char* file_read(const char* filename);
void print_log(GLuint object);
GLuint create_shader(const char* filename, GLenum type);
#endif
&lt;/source&gt;

Reference the new file in &lt;code&gt;triangle.cpp&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &quot;shader_utils.h&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

And in the &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
triangle: shader_utils.o
&lt;/source&gt;

= Using Vertex Buffer Objects (VBO) for efficiency =

It is good practice to store our vertices directly in the graphic card, using a Vertex Buffer Object (VBO).

In addition, &quot;client-side arrays&quot; support is officially removed since OpenGL 3.0, not present in WebGL, and is slower, so let's use VBOs from now on, even if they are slightly less simple.  It's important to know about both ways, because this is used in existing OpenGL code that you may come across.

We implement this in two steps:
* create a VBO with our vertices
* bind our VBO before calling &lt;code&gt;glDrawArray&lt;/code&gt;

Create a global variable (below the &lt;code&gt;#include&lt;/code&gt;) to store the VBO handle:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
GLuint vbo_triangle;
&lt;/source&gt;

In &lt;code&gt;init_resources&lt;/code&gt;, we move the &lt;code&gt;triangle_vertices&lt;/code&gt; definition, create one (1) data buffer and make it the current active buffer:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  GLfloat triangle_vertices[] = {
     0.0,  0.8,
    -0.8, -0.8,
     0.8, -0.8,
  };
  glGenBuffers(1, &amp;vbo_triangle);
  glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo_triangle);
&lt;/source&gt;
We now can push our vertices to this buffer. We specify how the data is organised, and how often it will be used.
GL_STATIC_DRAW indicates that we will not write to this buffer often, and that the GPU should keep a copy of it in its own memory. It is always possible to write new values to the VBO. If the data changes once per frame or more often, you could use GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW or GL_STREAM_DRAW.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(triangle_vertices), triangle_vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
&lt;/source&gt;

At any time, we can unset the active buffer like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;
In particular, make sure you disable the active buffer if you ever have to pass a C array directly.

In &lt;code&gt;onDisplay&lt;/code&gt;, we slightly adapt the code.
We call &lt;code&gt;glBindBuffer&lt;/code&gt;, and modify the last two parameters of &lt;code&gt;glVertexAttribPointer&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo_triangle);
  glEnableVertexAttribArray(attribute_coord2d);
  /* Describe our vertices array to OpenGL (it can't guess its format automatically) */
  glVertexAttribPointer(
    attribute_coord2d, // attribute
    2,                 // number of elements per vertex, here (x,y)
    GL_FLOAT,          // the type of each element
    GL_FALSE,          // take our values as-is
    0,                 // no extra data between each position
    0                  // offset of first element
  );
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's not forget to clean-up on exit:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void free_resources()
{
  glDeleteProgram(program);
  glDeleteBuffers(1, &amp;vbo_triangle);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, each time we'll draw our scene, OpenGL will already have all the vertices on the GPU side.  For large scenes, with thousands of polygons, this can be a huge speed-up.

= Check the OpenGL version =

Some of your users might not have a graphic card that supports OpenGL 2.
This will probably lead your program to crash or display an incomplete scene.
You can check this using GLEW (after a call to glewInit() succeeds):

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  if (!GLEW_VERSION_2_0) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error: your graphic card does not support OpenGL 2.0\n&quot;);
    return 1;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that some tutorials might just work with some nearly-2.0 cards, such as Intel 945GM which has limited shaders support but official OpenGL 1.4 support.

= Alternative to GLEW =

You may meet the following headers in other OpenGL code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#define GL_GLEXT_PROTOTYPES
#include &lt;GL/gl.h&gt;
#include &lt;GL/glext.h&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

If you do not need to load OpenGL extensions, ''and'' if your headers are recent enough, then you can use this instead of GLEW.
Our tests showed that Windows users may have outdated headers, and will miss symbols such as GL_VERTEX_SHADER, so we'll use GLEW in these tutorials (plus we'll be ready for loading extensions).

See also the comparison between GLEW and GLee in the [[../APIs,_Libraries_and_acronyms|APIs, Libraries and acronyms]] section.

A user reported that using this technique instead of GLEW on an Intel 945GM GPU allowed to bypass the partial OpenGL 2.0 support for simple tutorials. GLEW itself can be made to enable the partial support by adding &lt;code&gt;glewExperimental = GL_TRUE;&lt;/code&gt; before the call to &lt;code&gt;glutInit&lt;/code&gt;.

= Enabling transparency =

Our program is more maintainable now, but it does exactly the same thing as before!
So let's experiment a bit with transparency, and display the triangle with an &quot;old TV&quot; effect.

First, initialize GLUT with alpha:

 glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGBA|'''GLUT_ALPHA'''|GLUT_DOUBLE|GLUT_DEPTH);

Then explicitly enable transparency (it's off by default) in OpenGL. Add this to onDisplay():
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// Enable alpha
glEnable(GL_BLEND);
glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:OpenGL_Tutorial_Triangle_interleaved.png|thumb|150px|The rendered triangle, partially transparent]]
And last, we modify our fragment shader to define alpha transparency:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  gl_FragColor[0] = gl_FragCoord.x/640.0;
  gl_FragColor[1] = gl_FragCoord.y/480.0;
  gl_FragColor[2] = 0.5;
  if (mod(gl_FragCoord.y, 30.0) &gt; 15)
    gl_FragColor[3] = 1;
  else
    gl_FragColor[3] = 0.4;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;mod&lt;/code&gt; is a common maths operator, used to determine if we're on an even or an odd line.
Hence one line out of two is transparent, the other is opaque.

[[File:Jellyfish in pale orange with blue background.jpg|300px|thumb|left|A semitransparent jellyfish. Note the increased opaqueness at the silhouettes.]]
This tutorial covers the '''transformation of surface normal vectors'''. It assumes that you are familiar with alpha blending as discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Transparency|tutorial on transparency]] and with uniforms as discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Shading in View Space|tutorial on shading in view space]].

The objective of this tutorial is to achieve an effect that is visible in the photo to the left: the silhouettes of semitransparent objects tend to be more opaque than the rest of the object. This adds to the impression of a three-dimensional shape even without lighting. It turns out that transformed normals are crucial to obtain this effect.

[[File:Surface normal.png|300px|thumb|left|Surface normal vectors (for short: normals) on a surface patch.]]
===Silhouettes of Smooth Surfaces===
In the case of smooth surfaces, points on the surface at silhouettes are characterized by normal vectors that are parallel to the viewing plane and therefore orthogonal to the direction to the viewer. In the figure to the left, the blue normal vectors at the silhouette at the top of the figure are parallel to the viewing plane while the other normal vectors point more in the direction to the viewer (or camera). By calculating the direction to the viewer and the normal vector and testing whether they are (almost) orthogonal to each other, we can therefore test whether a point is (almost) on the silhouette.

More specifically, if '''V''' is the normalized (i.e. of length 1) direction to the viewer and '''N''' is the normalized surface normal vector, then the two vectors are orthogonal if the dot product is 0: '''V'''·'''N''' = 0. In practice, this will be rarely the case. However, if the dot product '''V'''·'''N''' is close to 0, we can assume that the point is close to a silhouette.

===Increasing the Opacity at Silhouettes===
For our effect, we should therefore increase the opacity &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; if the dot product '''V'''·'''N''' is close to 0. There are various ways to increase the opacity for small dot products between the direction to the viewer and the normal vector. Here is one of them (which actually has a physical model behind it, which is described in Section 5.1 of [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.125.1928 this publication]) to compute the increased opacity &lt;math&gt;\alpha'&lt;/math&gt; from the regular opacity &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of the material:

&lt;math&gt;\alpha'=\min\left(1, \frac{\alpha}{\left\vert\mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{N}\right\vert}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

It always makes sense to check the extreme cases of an equation like this. Consider the case of a point close to the silhouette: '''V'''·'''N''' ≈ 0. In this case, the regular opacity &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; will be divided by a small, positive number. (Note that GLSL guarantees to handle the case of division by zero gracefully; thus, we don't have to worry about it.) Therefore, whatever &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is, the ratio of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and a small positive number, will be larger. The &lt;math&gt;\min&lt;/math&gt; function will take care that the resulting opacity &lt;math&gt;\alpha'&lt;/math&gt; is never larger than 1.

On the other hand, for points far away from the silhouette we have '''V'''·'''N''' ≈ 1. In this case, α' ≈ min(1, α) ≈ α; i.e., the opacity of those points will not change much. This is exactly what we want. Thus, we have just checked that the equation is at least plausible. 

===Implementing an Equation in a Shader===
In order to implement an equation like the one for &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in a shader, the first question should be: Should it be implemented in the vertex shader or in the fragment shader? In some cases, the answer is clear because the implementation requires texture mapping, which is usually only available in the fragment shader. In many cases, however, there is no general answer. Implementations in vertex shaders tend to be faster (because there are usually fewer vertices than fragments) but of lower image quality (because normal vectors and other vertex attributes can change abruptly between vertices). Thus, if you are most concerned about performance, an implementation in a vertex shader is probably a better choice. On the other hand, if you are most concerned about image quality, an implementation in a pixel shader might be a better choice. The same trade-off exists between [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Specular Highlights|per-vertex lighting]] (i.e. Gouraud shading) and [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Smooth Specular Highlights|per-fragment lighting]] (i.e. Phong shading).

The next question is: in which coordinate system should the equation be implemented? (See [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Vertex Transformations|“Vertex Transformations”]] for a description of the standard coordinate systems.) Again, there is no general answer. However, an implementation in view coordinates is often a good choice in Blender because many uniform variables are specified in view coordinates. (In other environments implementations in world coordinates are more common.)

The final question before implementing an equation is: where do we get the parameters of the equation from? The regular opacity &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is specified (within a RGBA color) by a game property (see the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Shading in View Space|tutorial on shading in view space]]). The normal vector &lt;code&gt;gl_Normal&lt;/code&gt; is a standard vertex attribute (see the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Debugging of Shaders|tutorial on debugging of shaders]]). The direction to the viewer can be computed in the vertex shader as the vector from the vertex position in view space to the camera position in view space, which is always the origin, i.e. &lt;math&gt;(0,0,0)&lt;/math&gt;, as discussed in [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Vertex Transformations|“Vertex Transformations”]]. In other words, we should compute &lt;math&gt;(0,0,0)&lt;/math&gt; minus the position in view space, which is just the negative position in view space (apart from the fourth coordinate, which should be 0 for a direction).

Thus, we only have to transform the vertex position and the normal vector into view space before implementing the equation. The transformation matrix &lt;code&gt;gl_ModelViewMatrix&lt;/code&gt; from object space to view space and its inverse &lt;code&gt;gl_ModelViewMatrixInverse&lt;/code&gt; and the transpose of the inverse &lt;code&gt;gl_ModelViewMatrixInverseTranspose&lt;/code&gt; are all provided by Blender as discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Shading in View Space|tutorial on shading in view space]]. The application of transformation matrices to points and normal vectors is discuss in detail in [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Applying Matrix Transformations|“Applying Matrix Transformations”]]. The basic result is that points and directions are transformed just by multiplying them with the transformation matrix, e.g.:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
vec4 positionInViewSpace = gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex;
vec3 viewDirection = -vec3(positionInViewSpace); // == vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0) - vec3(positionInViewSpace)
&lt;/source&gt;
On the other hand '''normal vectors are transformed by multiplying them with the transposed inverse transformation matrix'''. Since Blender provides us with the transposed inverse transformation matrix &lt;code&gt;gl_ModelViewMatrixInverseTranspose&lt;/code&gt;, this could be used to transform normals. An alternative is to multiply the normal vector '''from the left''' to the inverse matrix  &lt;code&gt;gl_ModelViewMatrixInverse&lt;/code&gt;, which is equivalent to multiplying it from the right to the transposed inverse matrix as discussed in [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Applying Matrix Transformations|“Applying Matrix Transformations”]]. However, the best alternative is to use the 3×3 matrix &lt;code&gt;gl_NormalMatrix&lt;/code&gt;, which is the transposed inverse 3×3 matrix of the model-view matrix:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
vec3 normalInViewSpace = gl_NormalMatrix * gl_Normal; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we have all the pieces that we need to write the shader.

===Shader Code===
The fragment shader uses alpha blending as discussed in  the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Transparency|tutorial on transparency]]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
import bge

cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()

VertexShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
         varying vec3 varyingNormalDirection; 
            // normalized surface normal vector
         varying vec3 varyingViewDirection; 
            // normalized view direction 
                  
         void main()
         {				
            varyingNormalDirection = 
               normalize(gl_NormalMatrix * gl_Normal);
            varyingViewDirection = 
               -normalize(vec3(gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex));

            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
&quot;&quot;&quot;

FragmentShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
         varying vec3 varyingNormalDirection; 
            // normalized surface normal vector
         varying vec3 varyingViewDirection; 
            // normalized view direction 
                  
         const vec4 color = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.3);

         void main()
         {
         
            vec3 normalDirection = normalize(varyingNormalDirection);
            vec3 viewDirection = normalize(varyingViewDirection);
            
            float newOpacity = min(1.0, 
               color.a / abs(dot(viewDirection, normalDirection)));
            gl_FragColor = vec4(vec3(color), newOpacity);
         }
&quot;&quot;&quot;

mesh = cont.owner.meshes[0]
for mat in mesh.materials:
    shader = mat.getShader()
    if shader != None:
        if not shader.isValid():
            shader.setSource(VertexShader, FragmentShader, 1)
            mat.setBlending(bge.logic.BL_SRC_ALPHA, 
                            bge.logic.BL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)

&lt;/source&gt;

The assignment to &lt;code&gt;newOpacity&lt;/code&gt; is an almost literal translation of the equation

&lt;math&gt;\alpha'=\min\left(1, {\alpha} / {\left\vert\mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{N}\right\vert}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Note that we normalize the varyings &lt;code&gt;varyingNormalDirection&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;varyingViewDirection&lt;/code&gt; in the vertex shader (because we want to interpolate between directions without putting more nor less weight on any of them) and at the begin of the fragment shader (because the interpolation can distort our normalization to a certain degree). However, in many cases the normalization of &lt;code&gt;varyingNormalDirection&lt;/code&gt; in the vertex shader is not necessary. Similarly, the normalization of &lt;code&gt;varyingViewDirection&lt;/code&gt; in the fragment shader is in most cases unnecessary.

===More Artistic Control===
The fragment shader uses a constant &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; to specify the RGBA color of the surface. It would be easier for CG artists to modify this color if this constant was replaced by four game properties (see [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Shading in View Space|tutorial on shading in view space]]).

Moreover, this silhouette enhancement lacks artistic control; i.e., a CG artist cannot easily create a thinner or thicker silhouette than the physical model suggests. To allow for more artistic control, you could introduce another (positive) floating-point number property and take the dot product |'''V'''·'''N'''| to the power of this number before using it in the equation above. This will allow CG artists to create thinner or thicker silhouettes independently of the opacity of the base color.

===Summary===
Congratulations, you have finished this tutorial. We have discussed:
* How to find silhouettes of smooth surfaces (using the dot product of the normal vector and the view direction).
* How to enhance the opacity at those silhouettes.
* How to implement equations in shaders.
* How to transform points and normal vectors from object space to view space.
* How to compute the viewing direction (as the difference from the camera position to the vertex position).
* How to interpolate normalized directions (i.e. normalize twice: in the vertex shader and the fragment shader).
* How to provide more artistic control over the thickness of silhouettes .

===Further Reading===
If you still want to know more 
* about object space and world space, you should read the description of the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Vertex Transformations|“Vertex Transformations”]].
* about how to apply transformation matrices to points, directions and normal vectors, you should read [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Applying Matrix Transformations|“Applying Matrix Transformations”]].
* about the basics of rendering transparent objects, you should read the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Transparency|tutorial on transparency]].
* about uniform variables provided by Blender and game properties, you should read the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Shading in View Space|tutorial on shading in view space]].
* about the mathematics of silhouette enhancement, you could read Section 5.1 of the paper “Scale-Invariant Volume Rendering” by Martin Kraus, published at IEEE Visualization 2005, which is available [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.125.1928 online].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Metro Rail System Map.jpg|thumb|alt=A Metro Rail system map.|The Metro Rail system map (click to enlarge).]]

Metro Rail includes 70 stations.  Nine of them are termini, three are [[Getting around Los Angeles by Rail/Stops and Facilities/Metro Rail Transfer Stations|transfer stations]], and six are shared by the Red and Purple Lines, also known as a [[Getting around Los Angeles by Rail/Stops and Facilities/Metro Rail Transfer Stations#concurrencies|concurrency]].

==Station Basics==
[[File:LACMTA-GoldLine.jpg|thumb|alt=|A Gold Line train makes a stop at Los Angeles Union Station.]]

A '''station''' is a stop that a train stops at.  For example, Gold Line trains will stop at Los Angeles Union Station.  The doors will open at Los Angeles Union Station for passengers to exit and enter, then the train will continue on its way.

===Terminus===
A '''terminus''' is the final stop on a line.  For the Gold Line, the north terminus is Sierra Madre Villa.  This means that the final station that Gold Line trains stop at is Sierra Madre Villa.  At that point, the trains either go out of service or start in the other direction.  Following is a list of termini.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| [[Getting around Los Angeles by Rail/Metro Rail/Metro Purple Line|Purple Line]]  || Los Angeles Union Station || Wilshire/Western
|}
'''Note:''' The Metro Blue Line (see map above) starts at [[Getting around Los Angeles by Rail/Stops and Facilities/Metro Rail Transfer Stations/7th Street-Metro Center|7th Street/Metro Center]], continues south, and loops around Long Beach before returning north to 7th Street/Metro Center.  A Blue Line train would stop at Anaheim, 5th Street, 1st Street, Long Beach Transit Mall (which Metro officially recognizes as the terminus), and Pacific, then go back to Anaheim in a northerly direction.

===Transfer Station===
''Main Article: [[Getting around Los Angeles by Rail/Stops and Facilities/Metro Rail Transfer Stations|Metro Rail Transfer Stations]]

A '''transfer station''' is a station that two or more lines pass through.  These stations allow passengers to transfer between rail lines at no additional charge.

===Concurrency===
''Main Article: [[Getting around Los Angeles by Rail/Stops and Facilities/Metro Rail Transfer Stations#Concurrency|Concurrency]]''

A '''concurrency''' occurs when two or more lines share the same track.  The Red and Purple Lines share track between their termini, Los Angeles Union Station, and Wilshire/Vermont.  This means that passengers bound for North Hollywood or Wilshire/Western board on the same platform at concurrency stations, and passengers bound for Los Angeles Union Station board on the same platform as well.  Technically, since the concurrency extends all the way to Los Angeles Union Station, the termini for both lines, it doesn't matter which line train one takes if he/she is bound for Los Angeles Union Station.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Next &amp; Previous links ==

It would be nice to have on the right a &quot;Next&quot; and on the left a &quot;Previous&quot; link. But I do not know how to do it such that the link is active when a next/previous page exists and greyed out otherwise. It should always be visible. After these links are added, the navigation bar should be included at the bottom of each page also. This bottom navigation bar should have a &quot;Top&quot; link to go to the top of the page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Manipulating text for use in a CRF ==

Text is frequently copied into the Excel CRF from other programs (such as an electronic copy of the CRF or formulas from other spreadsheets).  This can bring formatting issues along with the text.  The text can be 'pasted as values' to remove the formatting.

=== Altering the options in Excel/Word ===

'Pasting as Values' is a common action with OpenClinica CRFs.  In Excel 2010, the keyboard shortcut is: Alt+h, v, v (Home Ribbon, Paste, Paste as Values).

You can add specific buttons to the Ribbon, in 2010, you select: File, Options, Customise Ribbon.  You can then add a new custom group (e.g. 'Custom Clipboard'), and add a paste button to it, such as 'Values'.

=== Using notepad ===
Text can be pasted into notepad (removing formatting), then any unwanted text (strange characters, tabs etc.) can be removed.  Then select all the text in notepad and copy it to the CRF.

=== The 'Text Calculator' ===

The [https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0BzfD9Kw8xaZbOTZjMDE5MDYtNmI5ZC00ZGZkLTgwNmItN2FlNmE1NTJmNWMy&amp;hl=en_US Text Calculator] spreadsheet quickly reformats paragraphs and tables of text from Word, PDFs or emails.  It takes the text list and reformats it in a number of different ways:
#HTML paragraphs
#HTML paragraphs (with grey text)
#A single string
#A response option text and response values list for radio buttons or dropdown (commas in the text are escaped automatically)
#A response option text and response values list for radio buttons or dropdown, with an additional default value of (select)

==== Generating a response option text list ====

For example, by pasting a list like this:

*Very good
*Good
*Moderate
*Poor
*Very poor

It generates OpenClinica response lists for radio buttons (escaping any commas):
*Very good,Good,Moderate,Poor,Very poor
*1,2,3,4,5
And response lists for dropdown lists with a default value:
*(select),Very good,Good,Moderate,Poor,Very poor
*,1,2,3,4,5

Commas in the text are escaped automatically for up to 20 values, and for the dropdown list cells, an additional (select) option is added as the first option in the list.

==== Generating paragraphs ====

It also takes text like this:
*Paragraph 1
*Paragraph 2
*Paragraph 3

And adds &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; (paragraph) tags to create an HTML version that can be used in OpenClinica, for example in a header.

==== How to use it ====

Use Excel's 'paste as text' option to paste into the spreadsheet under where it says 'Text'.  The results appear under the labels 'HTML grey paragraph', 'HTML black paragraph', 'Single string', 'Response options text (no default)', 'Response values (no default)', 'Response options text (with default)' and 'Response values (with default)'.  Copy and paste the contents of these cells into an OpenClinica CRF spreadsheet as needed.  The spreadsheet can be extended and altered as desired.

As the ordering of pasted text from a heavily formatted PDF can be unpredictable, it can be useful to copy the text to Notepad or a Word document (which also has the advantage of a spellchecker!) before copying to the spreadsheet.

[[File:The_phase_8_day_of_the_moon.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The light reflection from the surface of the moon is (in a good approximation) only diffuse.]]
This tutorial covers '''per-vertex diffuse reflection'''.

It's the first in a series of tutorials about basic lighting in Blender. In this tutorial, we start with diffuse reflection from a single directional light source and then include point lights and spotlights. Further tutorials cover extensions of this, in particular specular reflection, per-pixel lighting, two-sided lighting, and multiple light sources.

[[File:Diffuse_Reflection_Vectors.svg|250px|thumb|left|Diffuse reflection can be computed using the surface normal vector N and the light vector L, i.e. the vector to the light source.]]
===Diffuse Reflection===
The moon exhibits almost exclusively diffuse reflection (also called Lambertian reflection), i.e. light is reflected into all directions without specular highlights. Other examples of such materials are chalk and matte paper; in fact, any surface that appears dull and matte. 

In the case of perfect diffuse reflection, the intensity of the observed reflected light depends on the cosine of the angle between the surface normal vector and the ray of the incoming light. As illustrated in the figure to the left, it is common to consider normalized vectors starting in the point of a surface, where the lighting should be computed: the normalized surface normal vector '''N''' is orthogonal to the surface and the normalized light direction '''L''' points to the light source. 

For the observed diffuse reflected light &lt;math&gt;I_\text{diffuse}&lt;/math&gt;, we need the cosine of the angle between the normalized surface normal vector '''N''' and the normalized direction to the light source '''L''', which is the dot product '''N'''·'''L''' because the dot product '''a'''·'''b''' of any two vectors '''a''' and '''b''' is: 

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \left\vert \mathbf{a}\right\vert \left\vert \mathbf{b}\right\vert \cos \measuredangle(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})&lt;/math&gt;. 

In the case of normalized vectors, the lengths |'''a'''| and |'''b'''| are both 1.

If the dot product '''N'''·'''L''' is negative, the light source is on the “wrong” side of the surface and we should set the reflection to 0. This can be achieved by using  max(0, '''N'''·'''L'''), which makes sure that the value of the dot product is clamped to 0 for negative dot products. Furthermore, the reflected light depends on the intensity of the incoming light &lt;math&gt;I_\text{incoming}&lt;/math&gt; and a material constant &lt;math&gt;k_\text{diffuse}&lt;/math&gt; for the diffuse reflection: for a black surface, the material constant &lt;math&gt;k_\text{diffuse}&lt;/math&gt; is 0, for a white surface it is 1. The equation for the diffuse reflected intensity is then:

&lt;math&gt;I_\text{diffuse} = I_\text{incoming}\,k_\text{diffuse} \max(0,\mathbf{N}\cdot \mathbf{L})&lt;/math&gt;

For colored light, this equation applies to each color component (e.g. red, green, and blue). Thus, if the variables &lt;math&gt;I_\text{diffuse}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I_\text{incoming}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k_\text{diffuse}&lt;/math&gt; denote color vectors and the multiplications are performed component-wise (which they are for vectors in GLSL), this equation also applies to colored light. This is what we actually use in the shader code.

===Shader Code for One Directional Light Source===
If we have only one directional light source (i.e. a “sun” light in Blender), the shader code for implementing the equation for &lt;math&gt;I_\text{diffuse}&lt;/math&gt; is relatively small. In order to implement the equation, we follow the questions about implementing equations, which were discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Silhouette Enhancement|tutorial on silhouette enhancement]]:
* Should the equation be implemented in the vertex shader or the fragment shader? We try the vertex shader here. In the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Smooth Specular Highlights|tutorial on smooth specular highlights]], we will look at an implementation in the fragment shader.
* In which coordinate system should the equation be implemented? We try view space by default in Blender. (Which turns out to be a good choice here because Blender provides the light direction in view space.)
* Where do we get the parameters from? The answer to this is a bit longer:

As described in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Shading in View Space|tutorial on shading in view space]], &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontMaterial.diffuse&lt;/code&gt; is usually black; thus, we use &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontMaterial.emission&lt;/code&gt; for the diffuse material color &lt;math&gt;k_\text{diffuse}&lt;/math&gt;. (Remember to set '''Shading &gt; Emit''' to 1 in the '''Material tab'''.) The direction to the light source '''L''' in view space is available in &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource[0].position&lt;/code&gt; and the light color &lt;math&gt;I_\text{incoming}&lt;/math&gt; is available as &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource[0].diffuse&lt;/code&gt;. (If there is only one light source, it is always the 0th in the array &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource[]&lt;/code&gt;.) We get the surface normal vector in object coordinates from the attribute &lt;code&gt;gl_Normal&lt;/code&gt;. Since we implement the equation in view space, we have to convert the surface normal vector from object space to view space as discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Silhouette Enhancement|tutorial on silhouette enhancement]]. 

The vertex shader then looks like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec4 color; 

         void main()
         {                              
            vec3 normalDirection = 
               normalize(gl_NormalMatrix * gl_Normal);
            vec3 lightDirection = 
               normalize(vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position));
 
            vec3 diffuseReflection = 
               vec3(gl_LightSource[0].diffuse) 
               * vec3(gl_FrontMaterial.emission)
               * max(0.0, dot(normalDirection, lightDirection));

            color = vec4(diffuseReflection, 1.0); 
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
&lt;/source&gt;

And the fragment shader is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec4 color;

         void main()
         {            
            gl_FragColor = color;
         }
&lt;/source&gt;
When you try this shader, make sure that there is only one light source in the scene, which has to be directional, i.e. of type “Sun”. If there is no light source, you can create a directional light source by selecting '''Add &gt; Lamp &gt; Sun''' from the menu of the '''Info window'''.

===Changes for a Point Light Source===
In the case of a directional light source &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource[0].position&lt;/code&gt; specifies the direction from where light is coming. In the case of a point light source (or a spot light source), however, &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource[0].position&lt;/code&gt; specifies the position of the light source in view space and we have to compute the direction to the light source as the difference vector from the position of the vertex in view space to the position of the light source. Since the 4th coordinate of a point is 1 and the 4th coordinate of a direction is 0, we can easily distinguish between the two cases:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            vec3 lightDirection;

            if (0.0 == gl_LightSource[0].position.w) 
               // directional light?
            {
               lightDirection = 
                  normalize(vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position));
            } 
            else // point or spot light
            {
               lightDirection = 
                  normalize(vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position 
                  - gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex));
            }
&lt;/source&gt;
While there is no attenuation of light for directional light sources, we should add some attenuation with distance to point and spot light source. As light spreads out from a point in three dimensions, it's covering ever larger virtual spheres at larger distances. Since the surface of these spheres increases quadratically with increasing radius and the total amount of light per sphere is the same, the amount of light per area decreases quadratically with increasing distance from the point light source. Thus, we should divide the intensity of the light source by the squared distance to the vertex. 

Since a quadratic attenuation is rather rapid, we use a linear attenuation with distance, i.e. we divide the intensity by the distance instead of the squared distance. The code could be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            vec3 lightDirection;
            float attenuation;

            if (0.0 == gl_LightSource[0].position.w) 
               // directional light?
            {
               attenuation = 1.0; // no attenuation
               lightDirection = 
                  normalize(vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position));
            } 
            else // point or spot light
            {
               vec3 vertexToLightSource = 
                  vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position 
                  - gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex);
               float distance = length(vertexToLightSource);
               attenuation = 1.0 / distance; // linear attenuation 
               lightDirection = normalize(vertexToLightSource);
            }
&lt;/source&gt;
Usually, we would multiply the linear attenuation function &lt;code&gt;1.0 / distance&lt;/code&gt; by the uniform &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource[0].linearAttenuation&lt;/code&gt;; however, Blender apparently doesn't set this uniform variable correctly. In fact, if Blender would set the uniforms correctly, we should compute the attenuation this way:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
               attenuation = 
                  1.0 / (gl_LightSource[0].constantAttenuation 
                  + gl_LightSource[0].linearAttenuation * distance
                  + gl_LightSource[0].quadraticAttenuation 
                  * distance * distance);
&lt;/source&gt;
In any case, the factor &lt;code&gt;attenuation&lt;/code&gt; should then be multiplied with &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource[0].diffuse&lt;/code&gt; to compute the incoming light; see the complete shader code below. Note that spot light sources have additional features, which are discussed in the next section.

Also note that this code is unlikely to give you the best performance because any &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; is usually quite costly. Since &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource[0].position.w&lt;/code&gt; is either 0 or 1, it is actually not too hard to rewrite the code to avoid the use of &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and optimize a bit further:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            vec3 vertexToLightSource = vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position 
               - gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex 
               * gl_LightSource[0].position.w);
            float one_over_distance = 
               1.0 / length(vertexToLightSource);
            float attenuation = mix(1.0, one_over_distance, 
               gl_LightSource[0].position.w); 
            vec3 lightDirection = 
               vertexToLightSource * one_over_distance;
&lt;/source&gt;
However, we will use the version with &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; for clarity. (“Keep it simple, stupid!”)

===Changes for a Spotlight===
The 0th light source is a spotlight only if &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource[0].spotCutoff&lt;/code&gt; is less than or equal to 90.0 (otherwise it should be 180.0). Thus, the test could be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            if (gl_LightSource[0].spotCutoff &lt;= 90.0) // spotlight?
&lt;/source&gt;
The shape of a spotlight is described by the built-in uniforms &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource[0].spotDirection&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource[0].spotExponent&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource[0].spotCutoff&lt;/code&gt;. Specifically, if the cosine of the angle between &lt;code&gt;-lightDirection&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource[0].spotDirection&lt;/code&gt; is smaller than the cosine of &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource[0].spotCutoff&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. if the shaded point is outside the cone of light around the spotlight direction, then the attenuation factor is set to &lt;math&gt;0.0&lt;/math&gt;. We can compute the cosine of the angle between the two vectors by a dot product of the two normalized vectors. The cosine of &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource[0].spotCutoff&lt;/code&gt; is actually provided in &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource[0].spotCosCutoff&lt;/code&gt;. If we include clamping of the cosine at 0 in order to ignore points behind the spotlight, the test is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
                  float clampedCosine = max(0.0, dot(-lightDirection, 
                     gl_LightSource[0].spotDirection));
                  if (clampedCosine &lt; gl_LightSource[0].spotCosCutoff) 
                     // outside of spotlight cone?
                  {
                     attenuation = 0.0;
                  }
&lt;/source&gt;
Otherwise, if a point is inside the cone of light, the attenuation in OpenGL is supposed to be computed this way:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
                     attenuation = attenuation * pow(clampedCosine, 
                        gl_LightSource[0].spotExponent);
&lt;/source&gt;
This allows for wider (smaller &lt;code&gt;spotExponent&lt;/code&gt;) and narrower (larger &lt;code&gt;spotExponent&lt;/code&gt;) spotlights. 

However, Blender's built-in shader appear to do something more similar to:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
                     attenuation = attenuation * pow(clampedCosine
                        - gl_LightSource[0].spotCosCutoff, 
                        gl_LightSource[0].spotExponent / 128.0);
&lt;/source&gt;
We will stick to the OpenGL version here. 

===Complete Shader Code===
All in all, our new vertex shader for a single directional light, point light, or spotlight with linear attenuation becomes:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec4 color; 
 
         void main()
         {                              
            vec3 normalDirection = 
               normalize(gl_NormalMatrix * gl_Normal);
            vec3 lightDirection;
            float attenuation;
 
            if (0.0 == gl_LightSource[0].position.w) 
               // directional light?
            {
               attenuation = 1.0; // no attenuation
               lightDirection = 
                  normalize(vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position));
            } 
            else // point light or spotlight (or other kind of light) 
            {
               vec3 vertexToLightSource = 
                  vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position 
                  - gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex);
               float distance = length(vertexToLightSource);
               attenuation = 1.0 / distance; // linear attenuation 
               lightDirection = normalize(vertexToLightSource);
 
               if (gl_LightSource[0].spotCutoff &lt;= 90.0) // spotlight?
               {
                  float clampedCosine = max(0.0, dot(-lightDirection, 
                     gl_LightSource[0].spotDirection));
                  if (clampedCosine &lt; gl_LightSource[0].spotCosCutoff) 
                     // outside of spotlight cone?
                  {
                     attenuation = 0.0;
                  }
                  else
                  {
                     attenuation = attenuation * pow(clampedCosine, 
                        gl_LightSource[0].spotExponent);
                  }
               }
            }
            vec3 diffuseReflection = attenuation 
               * vec3(gl_LightSource[0].diffuse) 
               * vec3(gl_FrontMaterial.emission)
               * max(0.0, dot(normalDirection, lightDirection));
 
            color = vec4(diffuseReflection, 1.0);
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
&lt;/source&gt; 
And the fragment shader is still:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec4 color;

         void main()
         {            
            gl_FragColor = color;
         }
&lt;/source&gt;

Congratulations! You already learned a lot about OpenGL lights. This is essential for the following tutorials about more advanced lighting. Specifically, we have seen:
*What diffuse reflection is and how to describe it mathematically.
*How to implement diffuse reflection for a single directional light source in a shader.
*How to extend the shader for point light sources with a linear attenuation.
*How to further extend the shader to handle spotlights.

&lt;small&gt;(moved to your talk page since it was out of scope on that forum)&lt;/small&gt;

I know this may not be all that helpful, but I have been looking for the title of and or the author of a series of books I read about 20 years ago... The series was about a group of college kids that played DnD every week, this particular week one of the guys had managed to talk his girlfriend into joining them for a session... Something goes wrong and the players actually wake up in the DnD world as their characters... Like I said I have been trying to recall the name of the books or even the name of the writer of them... If anyone can help him in either find the name of these books or even the author I would forever be in your debt, thanks for taking he time to even read through all of this and thanks to any that might offer assistants...

Unfortunately this is not the series I'm looking for, the one I'm after is where the players become their characters and spend most of the series trying to get back into our world/ their home world...

[[File:Caravaggioapollo.jpg|250px|thumb|left|“Apollo the Lute Player” (Badminton House version) by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, ca. 1596.]]
This tutorial covers '''per-vertex lighting''' (also known as '''Gouraud shading''') using the '''Phong reflection model'''.

It extends the shader code in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Diffuse Reflection|tutorial on diffuse reflection]] by two additional terms: ambient lighting and specular reflection. Together, the three terms constitute the Phong reflection model. If you haven't read the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Diffuse Reflection|tutorial on diffuse reflection]], this would be a very good opportunity to read it.

===Ambient Light===
Consider the painting by Caravaggio to the left. While large parts of the white shirt are in shadows, no part of it is completely black. Apparently there is always some light being reflected from walls and other objects to illuminate everything in the scene — at least to a certain degree. In the Phong reflection model, this effect is taken into account by ambient lighting, which depends on a general ambient light intensity &lt;math&gt;I_\text{ambient light}&lt;/math&gt; and the material color &lt;math&gt;k_\text{diffuse}&lt;/math&gt; for diffuse reflection. In an equation for the intensity of ambient lighting &lt;math&gt;I_\text{ambient}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;I_\text{ambient} = I_\text{ambient light}\,k_\text{diffuse}&lt;/math&gt;

Analogously to the equation for diffuse reflection in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Diffuse Reflection|tutorial on diffuse reflection]], this equation can also be interpreted as a vector equation for the red, green, and blue components of light. 

In Blender, the ambient light is specified in the '''World tab''' of a '''Properties window'''. For a specific material, this color is multiplied with '''Shading &gt; Ambient''' from the '''Material tab''' of a '''Properties window''' such that the influence of the ambient color can be controlled for each material. In a GLSL shader in Blender, this product is available as &lt;code&gt;gl_LightModel.ambient&lt;/code&gt;, which is one of the pre-defined uniforms of the OpenGL compatibility profile mentioned in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Shading in View Space|tutorial on shading in view space]].

[[File:Phong_Vectors.svg|250px|thumb|left|The computation of the specular reflection requires the surface normal vector N, the direction to the light source L, the reflected direction to the light source R, and the direction to the viewer V.]]
===Specular Highlights===
If you have a closer look at Caravaggio's painting, you will see several specular highlights: on the nose, on the hair, on the lips, on the lute, on the violin, on the bow, on the fruits, etc. The Phong reflection model includes a specular reflection term that can simulate such highlights on shiny surfaces; it even includes a parameter &lt;math&gt;n_\text{shininess}&lt;/math&gt; to specify a shininess of the material. The shininess specifies how small the highlights are: the shinier, the smaller the highlights. 

A perfectly shiny surface will reflect light from the light source only in the geometrically reflected direction '''R'''. For less than perfectly shiny surfaces, light is reflected to directions around '''R''': the smaller the shininess, the wider the spreading. Mathematically, the normalized reflected direction '''R''' is defined by:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = 2 \mathbf{N} (\mathbf{N}\cdot\mathbf{L}) - \mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt;

for a normalized surface normal vector '''N''' and a normalized direction to the light source '''L'''. In GLSL, the function &lt;code&gt;vec3 reflect(vec3 I, vec3 N)&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;vec4 reflect(vec4 I, vec4 N)&lt;/code&gt;) computes the same reflected vector but for the direction &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; from the light source to the point on the surface. Thus, we have to negate our direction '''L''' to use this function.

The specular reflection term computes the specular reflection in the direction of the viewer '''V'''. As discussed above, the intensity should be large if '''V''' is close to '''R''', where “closeness” is parametrized by the shininess &lt;math&gt;n_\text{shininess}&lt;/math&gt;. In the Phong reflection model, the cosine of the angle between '''R''' and '''V''' to the  &lt;math&gt;n_\text{shininess}&lt;/math&gt;-th power is used to generate highlights of different shininess. Similarly to the case of the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Diffuse Reflection|diffuse reflection]], we should clamp negative cosines to 0. Furthermore, the specular term requires a material color &lt;math&gt;k_\text{specular}&lt;/math&gt; for the specular reflection, which is usually just white such that all highlights have the color of the incoming light &lt;math&gt;I_\text{incoming}&lt;/math&gt;. For example, all highlights in Caravaggio's painting are white. The specular term of the Phong reflection model is then:

&lt;math&gt;I_\text{specular} = I_\text{incoming}\,k_\text{specular} \max(0, \mathbf{R}\cdot \mathbf{V})^{n_\text{shininess}}&lt;/math&gt;

Analogously to the case of the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Diffuse Reflection|diffuse reflection]], the specular term should be ignored if the light source is on the “wrong” side of the surface; i.e., if the dot product '''N'''·'''L''' is negative.

===Shader Code===
The shader code for the ambient lighting could be straightforward with a component-wise vector-vector product:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            vec3 ambientLighting = vec3(gl_LightModel.ambient) 
               * vec3(gl_FrontMaterial.diffuse);
&lt;/source&gt;
However, as mentioned in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Shading in View Space|tutorial on shading in view space]], Blender doesn't set &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontMaterial.diffuse&lt;/code&gt; (nor &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontMaterial.ambient&lt;/code&gt;); thus, we use &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontMaterial.emission&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            vec3 ambientLighting = vec3(gl_LightModel.ambient) 
               * vec3(gl_FrontMaterial.emission);
&lt;/source&gt;

For the implementation of the specular reflection, we require the direction to the viewer in view space, which we can compute as the difference between the camera position and the vertex position (both in view space). The camera position in view space is trivial because the view space is defined such that the camera position is at the origin &lt;math&gt;(0,0,0)&lt;/math&gt;; see [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Vertex Transformations|“Vertex Transformations”]]. The vertex position can be transformed to view space as discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Diffuse Reflection|tutorial on diffuse reflection]]. The equation of the specular term in world space could then be implemented like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            vec3 viewDirection = 
               -normalize(vec3(gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex)); 
               // == vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0) - ... 

            vec3 specularReflection;
            if (dot(normalDirection, lightDirection) &lt; 0.0) 
               // light source on the wrong side?
            {
               specularReflection = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0); 
                  // no specular reflection
            }
            else // light source on the right side
            {
               specularReflection = attenuation 
                  * vec3(gl_LightSource[0].specular) 
                  * vec3(gl_FrontMaterial.specular) 
                  * pow(max(0.0, dot(reflect(-lightDirection, 
                  normalDirection), viewDirection)), 
                  gl_FrontMaterial.shininess);
            }
&lt;/source&gt;
This code snippet uses the same variables as the shader code in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Diffuse Reflection|tutorial on diffuse reflection]] and additionally the built-in uniforms &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontMaterial.specular&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontMaterial.shininess&lt;/code&gt;. (Which are specified by the user in Blender as mentioned in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Shading in View Space|tutorial on shading in view space]].) &lt;code&gt;pow(a, b)&lt;/code&gt; computes &lt;math&gt;a^b&lt;/math&gt;.

If the ambient lighting and the specular reflection is added the full vertex shader of the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Diffuse Reflection|tutorial on diffuse reflection]], it looks like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec4 color; 
 
         void main()
         {                              
            vec3 normalDirection = 
               normalize(gl_NormalMatrix * gl_Normal);
            vec3 viewDirection = 
               -normalize(vec3(gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex)); 
            vec3 lightDirection;
            float attenuation;
 
            if (0.0 == gl_LightSource[0].position.w) 
               // directional light?
            {
               attenuation = 1.0; // no attenuation
               lightDirection = 
                  normalize(vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position));
            } 
            else // point light or spotlight (or other kind of light) 
            {
               vec3 vertexToLightSource = 
                  vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position 
                  - gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex);
               float distance = length(vertexToLightSource);
               attenuation = 1.0 / distance; // linear attenuation 
               lightDirection = normalize(vertexToLightSource);
 
               if (gl_LightSource[0].spotCutoff &lt;= 90.0) // spotlight?
               {
                  float clampedCosine = max(0.0, dot(-lightDirection, 
                     gl_LightSource[0].spotDirection));
                  if (clampedCosine &lt; gl_LightSource[0].spotCosCutoff) 
                     // outside of spotlight cone?
                  {
                     attenuation = 0.0;
                  }
                  else
                  {
                     attenuation = attenuation * pow(clampedCosine, 
                        gl_LightSource[0].spotExponent);
                  }
               }
            }
            
            vec3 ambientLighting = vec3(gl_LightModel.ambient) 
               * vec3(gl_FrontMaterial.emission);
              
            vec3 diffuseReflection = attenuation 
               * vec3(gl_LightSource[0].diffuse) 
               * vec3(gl_FrontMaterial.emission)
               * max(0.0, dot(normalDirection, lightDirection));
 
            vec3 specularReflection;
            if (dot(normalDirection, lightDirection) &lt; 0.0) 
               // light source on the wrong side?
            {
               specularReflection = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);0 
                  // no specular reflection
            }
            else // light source on the right side
            {
               specularReflection = attenuation 
                  * vec3(gl_LightSource[0].specular) 
                  * vec3(gl_FrontMaterial.specular) 
                  * pow(max(0.0, dot(reflect(-lightDirection, 
                  normalDirection), viewDirection)), 
                  gl_FrontMaterial.shininess);
            }

            color = vec4(ambientLighting + diffuseReflection 
               + specularReflection, 1.0);
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
&lt;/source&gt;
The fragment shader is still:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec4 color;

         void main()
         {            
            gl_FragColor = color;
         }
&lt;/source&gt;

===Summary===
Congratulation, you just learned how to implement the Phong reflection model. In particular, we have seen:
* What the ambient lighting in the Phong reflection model is.
* What the specular reflection term in the Phong reflection model is. 
* How these terms can be implemented in GLSL in Blender.

===Further Reading===
If you still want to know more 
* about the shader code, you should read the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Diffuse Reflection|tutorial on diffuse reflection]].

[[File:Oloid Surface3.png|250px|thumb|left|An algebraic surface that includes an oloid in the center. The rendering uses different colors for the two sides of the surface.]]
This tutorial covers '''two-sided per-vertex lighting'''.

It's part of a series of tutorials about basic lighting in Blender. In this tutorial, we extend the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Specular Highlights|tutorial on specular highlights]] to render two-sided surfaces. If you haven't read the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Specular Highlights|tutorial on specular highlights]], this would be a very good time to read it.

[[File:Phong_Vectors.svg|250px|thumb|right|The surface normal vector N and the direction to the viewer V are usually on the same side of the surface but there are exceptions; thus, one shouldn't rely on it.]]
===Two-Sided Lighting===
As shown by the figure to the left, it's sometimes useful to apply different colors to the two sides of a surface. In the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Cutaways|tutorial on cutaways]], we have seen how a fragment shader can use the built-in variable &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontFacing&lt;/code&gt; to determine whether a fragment is part of a front-facing or a back-facing triangle. Can a vertex shader also determine whether it is part of a front-facing or a back-facing triangle? The answer is a clear: '''no!''' One reason is that the same vertex can be part of a front-facing '''and''' a back-facing triangle at the same time; thus, whatever decision is made in the vertex shader, it is potentially wrong for some triangles. If you want a simple rule to remember: “Fragments are either front-facing or back-facing. Vertices are bi.”

Thus, two-sided per-vertex lighting has to let the fragment shader determine, whether the front or the back material color should be applied. For example, with this fragment shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec4 frontColor; // color for front face
         varying vec4 backColor; // color for back face

         void main()
         {
            if (gl_FrontFacing) // is the fragment part of a front face?
            {
               gl_FragColor = frontColor;
            }
            else // fragment is part of a back face
            {
               gl_FragColor = backColor;
            }
         }
&lt;/source&gt;
On the other hand, this means that the vertex shader has to compute the surface lighting twice: for a front face and for a back face. Fortunately, this is usually still less work than computing the surface lighting for each fragment. 

===Vertex Shader Code===
The vertex shader code for two-sided per-vertex lighting is a straightforward extension of the code in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Specular Highlights|tutorial on specular highlights]]. However, we have to deactivate back-face culling as described in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Transparency|tutorial on transparency]]. Furthermore, the shader requires two sets of material parameters (front and back), which could be available as &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontMaterial&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gl_BackMaterial&lt;/code&gt;. With these two sets of parameters, the vertex shader could compute two colors, one for front faces and one for back faces, where the negated normal vector has to be used for the back faces. Both colors are handed to the fragment shader, which decides which color to apply. Unfortunately, there is apparently no way in Blender to specify different materials for the front and back faces. Instead, &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontMaterial&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gl_BackMaterial&lt;/code&gt; contain always the same data. Thus, in Blender you will have to introduce new uniforms or constants to specify different parameters for the front and the back material. In this tutorial, however, we just pretend that Blender would different parameters in &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontMaterial&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gl_BackMaterial&lt;/code&gt;. The vertex shader code is then:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec4 frontColor; // the lighting of front faces 
            // that was computed in the vertex shader
         varying vec4 backColor; // the lighting of back faces 
            // that was computed in the vertex shader
 
         void main()
         {                              
            vec3 normalDirection = 
               normalize(gl_NormalMatrix * gl_Normal);
            vec3 viewDirection = 
               -normalize(vec3(gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex)); 
            vec3 lightDirection;
            float attenuation;
 
            if (0.0 == gl_LightSource[0].position.w) 
               // directional light?
            {
               attenuation = 1.0; // no attenuation
               lightDirection = 
                  normalize(vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position));
            } 
            else // point light or spotlight (or other kind of light) 
            {
               vec3 vertexToLightSource = 
                  vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position 
                  - gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex);
               float distance = length(vertexToLightSource);
               attenuation = 1.0 / distance; // linear attenuation 
               lightDirection = normalize(vertexToLightSource);
 
               if (gl_LightSource[0].spotCutoff &lt;= 90.0) // spotlight?
               {
                  float clampedCosine = max(0.0, dot(-lightDirection, 
                     gl_LightSource[0].spotDirection));
                  if (clampedCosine &lt; gl_LightSource[0].spotCosCutoff) 
                     // outside of spotlight cone?
                  {
                     attenuation = 0.0;
                  }
                  else
                  {
                     attenuation = attenuation * pow(clampedCosine, 
                        gl_LightSource[0].spotExponent);
                  }
               }
            }

            // Computation of lighting for front faces

               + backSpecularReflection, 1.0);

            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
&lt;/source&gt;
The fragment shader code is described above.

===Summary===
Congratulations, you made it to the end of this short tutorial with a long shader. We have seen:
*Why a vertex shader cannot distinguish between front-facing and back-facing vertices (because the same vertex might be part of a front-facing and a back-facing triangles).
*How to compute lighting for front faces and for back faces in the vertex shader.
*How to let the fragment shader decide which color to apply.

===Further Reading===
If you still want to know more 
* about the shader version for single-sided surfaces, you should read the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Specular Highlights|tutorial on specular highlights]].
* about front-facing and back-facing triangles in GLSL, you should read the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Cutaways|tutorial on cutaways]].

[[File:Phongshading00.png|250px|thumb|left|Rendering of a torus mesh with per-pixel lighting.]]
This tutorial covers '''per-pixel lighting''' (also known as '''Phong shading'''). 

It is based on the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Specular Highlights|tutorial on specular highlights]]. If you haven't read that tutorial yet, you should read it first. The main disadvantage of per-vertex lighting (i.e. of computing the surface lighting for each vertex and then interpolating the vertex colors) is the limited quality, in particular for specular highlights as demonstrated by the figure to the left. The remedy is per-pixel lighting which computes the lighting for each fragment based on an interpolated normal vector. While the resulting image quality is considerably higher, the performance costs are also significant. 

===Per-Pixel Lighting (Phong Shading)===
Per-pixel lighting is also known as Phong shading (in contrast to per-vertex lighting, which is also known as Gouraud shading). This should not be confused with the Phong reflection model (also called Phong lighting), which computes the surface lighting by an ambient, a diffuse, and a specular term as discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Specular Highlights|tutorial on specular highlights]].

The key idea of per-pixel lighting is easy to understand: normal vectors and positions are interpolated for each fragment and the lighting is computed in the fragment shader. 

===Shader Code===
Apart from optimizations, implementing per-pixel lighting based on shader code for per-vertex lighting is straightforward: the lighting computation is moved from the vertex shader to the fragment shader and the vertex shader has to write the attributes required for the lighting computation to varyings. The fragment shader then uses these varyings to compute the lighting (instead of the attributes that the vertex shader used). That's about it. 

In this tutorial, we adapt the shader code from the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Specular Highlights|tutorial on specular highlights]] to per-pixel lighting. The resulting vertex shader looks like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec4 position; 
            // position of the vertex (and fragment) in view space 
         varying vec3 varyingNormalDirection; 
            // surface normal vector in view space

         void main()
         {                              
            position = gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex; 
            varyingNormalDirection = 
               normalize(gl_NormalMatrix * gl_Normal);             

            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
&lt;/source&gt;

Most of the work is now done in the fragment shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec4 position; 
            // position of the vertex (and fragment) in view space 
         varying vec3 varyingNormalDirection; 
            // surface normal vector in view space

         void main()
         {
            vec3 normalDirection = normalize(varyingNormalDirection);
            vec3 viewDirection = -normalize(vec3(position)); 
            vec3 lightDirection;
            float attenuation;
 
            if (0.0 == gl_LightSource[0].position.w) 
               // directional light?
            {
               attenuation = 1.0; // no attenuation
               lightDirection = 
                  normalize(vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position));
            } 
            else // point light or spotlight (or other kind of light) 
            {
               vec3 positionToLightSource = 
                  vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position - position);
               float distance = length(positionToLightSource);
               attenuation = 1.0 / distance; // linear attenuation 
               lightDirection = normalize(positionToLightSource);
 
               if (gl_LightSource[0].spotCutoff &lt;= 90.0) // spotlight?
               {
                  float clampedCosine = max(0.0, dot(-lightDirection, 
                     gl_LightSource[0].spotDirection));
                  if (clampedCosine &lt; gl_LightSource[0].spotCosCutoff) 
                     // outside of spotlight cone?
                  {
                     attenuation = 0.0;
                  }
                  else
                  {
                     attenuation = attenuation * pow(clampedCosine, 
                        gl_LightSource[0].spotExponent);   
                  }
               }
            }

            vec3 ambientLighting = vec3(gl_LightModel.ambient) 
               * vec3(gl_FrontMaterial.emission);
              
            vec3 diffuseReflection = attenuation 
               * vec3(gl_LightSource[0].diffuse) 
               * vec3(gl_FrontMaterial.emission)
               * max(0.0, dot(normalDirection, lightDirection));
 
            vec3 specularReflection;
            if (dot(normalDirection, lightDirection) &lt; 0.0) 
               // light source on the wrong side?
            {
               specularReflection = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0); 
                  // no specular reflection
            }
            else // light source on the right side
            {
               specularReflection = attenuation 
                  * vec3(gl_LightSource[0].specular) 
                  * vec3(gl_FrontMaterial.specular) 
                  * pow(max(0.0, dot(reflect(-lightDirection, 
                  normalDirection), viewDirection)), 
                  gl_FrontMaterial.shininess);
            }

            gl_FragColor = vec4(ambientLighting 
               + diffuseReflection + specularReflection, 1.0);
         }
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that the vertex shader writes a normalized vector to &lt;code&gt;varyingNormalDirection&lt;/code&gt; in order to make sure that all directions are weighted equally in the interpolation. The fragment shader normalizes it again because the interpolated directions are no longer normalized.

===Summary===
Congratulations, now you know how per-pixel Phong lighting works. We have seen:
*Why the quality provided by per-vertex lighting is sometimes insufficient (in particular because of specular highlights).

This tutorial covers '''two-sided per-pixel lighting''' (i.e. '''two-sided Phong shading''').

Here we combine the per-pixel lighting discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Smooth Specular Highlights|tutorial on smooth specular highlights]] with the two-sided lighting discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Two-Sided Surfaces|tutorial on two-sided surfaces]]. 

===Shader Coder===
The required changes to the code of the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Smooth Specular Highlights|tutorial on smooth specular highlights]] are: new properties for the back material, new local variables for the material parameters in the fragment shader, which are set either to the front material parameters or the back material parameters according to &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontFacing&lt;/code&gt;. Also, the surface normal vector is negated in case a back face is rendered. Furthermore, back-face culling has to be deactivated as described in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Transparency|tutorial on transparency]]. It's actually quite straightforward. However, keep in mind that Blender apparently never provides different data in &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontMaterial&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gl_BackMaterial&lt;/code&gt;; thus, you have to replace the uniforms in &lt;code&gt;gl_BackMaterial&lt;/code&gt; by user-specified uniforms (see the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Shading in View Space|tutorial on shading in view space]]).

The vertex shader could look like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec4 position; 
            // position of the vertex (and fragment) in view space 
         varying vec3 varyingNormalDirection; 
            // surface normal vector in view space

         void main()
         {                              
            position = gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex; 
            varyingNormalDirection = 
               normalize(gl_NormalMatrix * gl_Normal);             

            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
&lt;/source&gt;

And the fragment shader could be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec4 position; 
            // position of the vertex (and fragment) in view space 
         varying vec3 varyingNormalDirection; 
            // surface normal vector in view space

         void main()
         {
            vec3 normalDirection = normalize(varyingNormalDirection);
            vec4 ambientColor;
            vec4 diffuseColor;
            vec4 specularColor;
            float shininess;

            if (gl_FrontFacing)
            {
               ambientColor = gl_FrontMaterial.emission;
               diffuseColor = gl_FrontMaterial.emission;
               specularColor = gl_FrontMaterial.specular;
               shininess = gl_FrontMaterial.shininess;
            }
            else
            {
               ambientColor = gl_BackMaterial.emission;
               diffuseColor = gl_BackMaterial.emission;
               specularColor = gl_BackMaterial.specular;
               shininess = gl_BackMaterial.shininess;
               normalDirection = -normalDirection;
            }

            vec3 viewDirection = -normalize(vec3(position)); 
            vec3 lightDirection;
            float attenuation;
 
            if (0.0 == gl_LightSource[0].position.w) 
               // directional light?
            {
               attenuation = 1.0; // no attenuation
               lightDirection = 
                  normalize(vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position));
            } 
            else // point light or spotlight (or other kind of light) 
            {
               vec3 positionToLightSource = 
                  vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position - position);
               float distance = length(positionToLightSource);
               attenuation = 1.0 / distance; // linear attenuation 
               lightDirection = normalize(positionToLightSource);
 
               if (gl_LightSource[0].spotCutoff &lt;= 90.0) // spotlight?
               {
                  float clampedCosine = max(0.0, dot(-lightDirection, 
                     gl_LightSource[0].spotDirection));
                  if (clampedCosine &lt; gl_LightSource[0].spotCosCutoff) 
                     // outside of spotlight cone?
                  {
                     attenuation = 0.0;
                  }
                  else
                  {
                     attenuation = attenuation * pow(clampedCosine, 
                        gl_LightSource[0].spotExponent); 
                  }
               }
            }

            vec3 ambientLighting = vec3(gl_LightModel.ambient) 
               * vec3(ambientColor);
              
            vec3 diffuseReflection = attenuation 
               * vec3(gl_LightSource[0].diffuse) * vec3(diffuseColor)
               * max(0.0, dot(normalDirection, lightDirection));
 
            vec3 specularReflection;
            if (dot(normalDirection, lightDirection) &lt; 0.0) 
               // light source on the wrong side?
            {
               specularReflection = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0); 
                  // no specular reflection
            }
            else // light source on the right side
            {
               specularReflection = attenuation 
                  * vec3(gl_LightSource[0].specular) 
                  * vec3(specularColor) * pow(max(0.0, 
                  dot(reflect(-lightDirection, normalDirection), 
                  viewDirection)), shininess);
            }

            gl_FragColor = vec4(ambientLighting + diffuseReflection 
               + specularReflection, 1.0);
         }
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:Subway lights in tunnel.JPG|250px|thumb|left|Multiple subway lights of limited range in a tunnel.]]
This tutorial covers '''lighting by multiple light sources'''.

This tutorial is an extension of the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Smooth Specular Highlights|tutorial on smooth specular highlights]]. If you haven't read that tutorial, you should read it first.

===Multiple Lights===
In the previous tutorials on [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Diffuse Reflection|diffuse reflection]], etc., we have only used one light source, which was specified by the uniform &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource[0]&lt;/code&gt;. However, &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource&lt;/code&gt; is actually an array of up to &lt;code&gt;gl_MaxLights&lt;/code&gt; light sources.

Here, we take a certain number of these lights (up to &lt;code&gt;gl_MaxLights&lt;/code&gt;) into account and add their contributions to the total lighting. This can be computed with a for-loop in the fragment shader of the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Smooth Specular Highlights|tutorial on smooth specular highlights]]. The structure is this:
{{clear}}
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            const int numberOfLights = gl_MaxLights; 
               // up to gl_MaxLights (often 8)
            ...
            // initialize total lighting with ambient lighting
            vec3 totalLighting = vec3(gl_LightModel.ambient) 
               * vec3(gl_FrontMaterial.emission);
     
            for (int index = 0; index &lt; numberOfLights; index++) 
               // for all light sources
            {
               ... compute diffuseReflection and specularReflection 
               for gl_LightSource[index] ...

               totalLighting = totalLighting + diffuseReflection 
                  + specularReflection;
            }
            gl_FragColor = vec4(totalLighting, 1.0);
            ...
&lt;/source&gt;
The total lighting by all lights is accumulated in &lt;code&gt;totalLighting&lt;/code&gt; by initializing it to the ambient lighting and then adding the diffuse and specular reflection of each light to the previous value of &lt;code&gt;totalLighting&lt;/code&gt; at the end of the for-loop. A for-loop should be familiar to any C/C++/Java/JavaScript programmer. Note that for-loops are sometimes severely limited. Specifically, sometimes you cannot even use uniforms to determine the limits. (The technical reason for the limitation is that the limits have to be known at compile time in order to “un-roll” the loop. &lt;code&gt;gl_MaxLights&lt;/code&gt; is an exception to the rule that uniforms are not allowed as limits because it is one of the built-in uniforms that is constant for all shaders on a certain GPU, i.e. its value is known if the shader is compiled for a specific GPU.) 

===Complete Shader Code===
The vertex shader is the same as in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Smooth Specular Highlights|tutorial on smooth specular highlights]]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec4 position; 
            // position of the vertex (and fragment) in view space 
         varying vec3 varyingNormalDirection; 
            // surface normal vector in view space
 
         void main()
         {                              
            position = gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex; 
            varyingNormalDirection = 
               normalize(gl_NormalMatrix * gl_Normal);             
 
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
&lt;/source&gt;
The only tricky thing about the fragment shader is that the nesting of loops and conditionals appears to be limited on some GPUs and/or graphics drivers. In fact, I had to reduce the nesting by avoiding if-else-statements in order to compile the shader on my computer (the OpenGL API reported an internal error). In principle, nesting of conditionals and loops is allowed in GLSL; however, it is probably a good idea to test shaders that make extensive use of nested loops and conditionals on several systems. 

Be sure to disable as many default lights through the Preferences within Blender. This will prevent confusion when using less than three light sources.

&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         const int numberOfLights = gl_MaxLights; 
            // up to gl_MaxLights (often 8)

         varying vec4 position; 
            // position of the vertex (and fragment) in view space 
         varying vec3 varyingNormalDirection; 
            // surface normal vector in view space
 
         void main()
         {
            vec3 normalDirection = normalize(varyingNormalDirection);
            vec3 viewDirection = -normalize(vec3(position)); 
            vec3 lightDirection = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
            float attenuation = 1.0;

            // initialize total lighting with ambient lighting
            vec3 totalLighting = vec3(gl_LightModel.ambient) 
               * vec3(gl_FrontMaterial.emission);
     
            for (int index = 0; index &lt; numberOfLights; index++) 
               // for all light sources
            {
               if (0.0 == gl_LightSource[index].position.w) 
                  // directional light?
               {
                  attenuation = 1.0; // no attenuation
                  lightDirection = 
                     normalize(vec3(gl_LightSource[index].position));
               } 
               if (0.0 != gl_LightSource[index].position.w 
                  &amp;&amp; gl_LightSource[index].spotCutoff &gt; 90.0) 
                  // point light? 
               {
                  vec3 positionToLightSource = 
                     vec3(gl_LightSource[index].position - position);
                  float distance = length(positionToLightSource);
                  attenuation = 1.0 / distance; // linear attenuation                    
                  lightDirection = normalize(positionToLightSource);
               }
               if (0.0 != gl_LightSource[index].position.w 
                 &amp;&amp; gl_LightSource[index].spotCutoff &lt;= 90.0)

                  float clampedCosine = max(0.0, dot(-lightDirection, 
                     gl_LightSource[0].spotDirection));
                  if (clampedCosine &lt; gl_LightSource[0].spotCosCutoff) 
                     // outside of spotlight cone?
                  {
                     attenuation = 0.0;
                  }
                  else
                  {
                     attenuation = attenuation * pow(clampedCosine, 
                        gl_LightSource[0].spotExponent);   
                  }
               }
     
               vec3 diffuseReflection = attenuation

The word ''design'' has several meanings. One meaning is a plan or drawing that shows the look and function of an object or structure before it is made. This is the meaning of design that we consider in this chapter. Examples of this meaning for design include:
* a team of architects may develop the design of a building, specifying the building's appearance and the layout of rooms, doors, and hallways;
* a team of engineers may develop the design for a new jet engine, specifying its structure and the materials from which it is built.

Figures 1 and 2 show examples of this type of design.
{{clear}}
[[File:First story floor plan.jpg|550px|thumb|center|'''Figure 4.1''': The floor plan of the first story of a house. Architects document their designs using such floor plans.]]
[[File:Jet engine.svg|550px|thumb|center|'''Figure 4.2''': A design of a jet engine.]]

In general conversation, the word ''design'' is often used to mean &quot;an arrangement of lines or shapes to form a pattern or decoration&quot;. Figure 3 shows an example of this meaning for design; this is not the meaning that we are considering in this chapter.

[[File:High School Engineering Figure 4.3.jpg|frame|center|'''Figure 4.3''': A design can be an arrangement of shapes and lines that forms a decorative pattern. This is the type of design that we will consider in this chapter.]]

A process by which a design for an object or a structure is created is called a ''design process''. All design processes have similarities. They all involve creativity. They all involve making decisions. However, engineering design tends to require a more extensive and specialized knowledge of technology, math, and science than other types of design.

==Engineering Design==
Teams undertake several different types of engineering design projects. Most projects involve modifying or enhancing an existing product or process; these projects are described as '''incremental design'''. Sometimes a new product is developed from scratch. Such a project would be a new design. Both types of projects use the design process.

The purpose of most design projects is to develop an object, structure, or process that meets the needs of '''customers''' and '''stakeholders'''. A customer is someone who will use the designed object; customers usually pay for the product. A stakeholder is someone who has an interest in the product. Customers are stakeholders; other stakeholders may include government agencies, companies, and individuals. For example, stakeholders for a new automobile design might include the individuals who will purchase it, the mechanics who will maintain and repair it, the Environmental Protection Agency that will monitor its emissions, and the oil companies that will supply its fuel.

Design problems are almost always open ended—they rarely have a single correct solution. Instead, there are usually several solutions that will satisfy the desired needs. One of the challenges of design is to choose from the vast number of possible solutions. Indeed, engineered products may be very complex, and the design of such products may require that a design team make hundreds or thousands of decisions. Without a clearly defined process to follow, the team may not develop designs that meet the needs of customers or other stakeholders; the team may make poor decisions or lose sight of the important attributes of
the product. Thus, it is important to use a structured design process. Structured design processes offer several advantages. They provide a framework in which the team decision-making is made explicit and the decision process can be well documented. They also reduce the likelihood that important issues will be forgotten or overlooked.

In this section, we describe &quot;the engineering design process&quot;, which may give the impression that there is only one correct process. In reality, many processes have been successfully applied to engineering design. The design process discussed in this section may not always be the best for a given project or problem. The design process should not be applied blindly, but should be adapted to fit the circumstances of the design team and the particular project. The design process should also be subjected to a continuous improvement process so that the design team's performance improves over time.

The engineering design process may not result in a '''viable''' design for several reasons:

* Incorrect or unrealistic assumptions.
* A lack of understanding of the desired needs or underlying problems to be solved.
* Errors in design specifications or representations (e.g. '''models''' and drawings).
* Inadequate testing of '''prototypes'''.
* Poor design choices.

Sometimes, poor design decisions made early in the process will make it impossible to develop a design that successfully meets customers' needs.

==A Design Process==
In this section we present a typical engineering design process. Other descriptions of the design process may break the process into somewhat different steps and may use somewhat different terms to describe the steps, but most design processes are similar to this one. An example of how this design process could be applied is in [[../The Design Process in Action/]] section.

Our basic engineering design process includes the steps shown in Figure 4. Note that Figure 4 shows each step being completed before the next step begins; this process is sequential. In many real-life situations, the design team may revisit a step several times to create the final design. We now describe the steps in more detail.

'''Define the problem'''. In the problem definition step, the needs of potential customers are investigated; potential competitors are identified and their market positions are '''characterized'''; '''constraints''' imposed by government regulations or technological limitations are identified; and constraints on the design effort such as available personnel, time, and money are established. The problem definition process results in a clear understanding of the scope of the design project and the resources available to solve the design problem. This understanding is often expressed in a '''problem statement'''. This understanding is also expressed in the form of criteria and constraints.

'''Identify criteria and constraints'''. '''Criteria''' and constraints are used to evaluate the quality of a design. Constraints describe conditions that must be met by the design and design process; a design must meet all constraints. Criteria are measurable values that can be used to compare several designs and determine which is better.

'''Generate ideas'''. Once criteria and constraints are identified, the design team generates ideas for designs. These ideas come from many different sources; these include existing products (including competitors' products), brainstorming and other creative activities, and market and technical research. Ideas are combined to generate potential designs; at this stage, designs are concepts without a significant level of detail.

'''Explore possibilities'''. After potential designs are generated, they are explored to understand their characteristics and likely advantages and disadvantages.

'''Select a design concept'''. Potential designs are evaluated relative to the constraints and criteria, and one or more is selected to be designed in detail and prototyped. This selection is made using a structured process that requires the constraints to be met and chooses the best design according to the criteria.

'''Develop a detailed design'''. The selected design is developed in more detail. The '''design architecture''' is established by identifying physical and functional chunks. Shapes and '''dimensions''' are determined, materials and fabrication processes are selected, and product components are identified. The design is developed in enough detail that prototypes and models of the design can be made.

'''Create models and prototypes'''. One or more prototypes are typically implemented to characterize various aspects of the design. Prototypes may be physical models of the design in which dimensions, materials, and fabrication processes emulate important aspects of the design. Increasingly, prototypes are implemented using computer modeling software that simulates mechanical, electrical, and other characteristics of the product.

'''Test and evaluate'''. Prototypes are tested to see whether the design meets all constraints and performs acceptably relative to the criteria.

'''Refine the design'''. Testing and evaluation may reveal weaknesses of the design or indicate ways in which the design may be improved. At this point, the design may be refined to better meet the criteria and constraints. Sometimes, testing and evaluation show that a design will not work, so that a different design concept must be selected; in this case, the process goes back to the &quot;Select a design concept&quot; step.

'''Implementation'''. Depending on the context, the design is produced or constructed.

'''Communicate process and results'''. The activities and results of the design process are documented. This documentation is communicated to the appropriate stakeholders in the design.

The design process in Figure 4 is often called a sequential process because each step follows the previous one in direct sequence. This model does not account for the iterative nature of many actual design projects; as designs are developed, prototyped, and evaluated, their strengths and weaknesses are better understood and changes are made to the design on the basis of this improved understanding. After changing the design, the process of prototyping and evaluating is repeated. The design process in which the processes are iterated is often called a spiral design process. A spiral design process is illustrated in Figure 5.

The advantage of using a spiral design process is that the end design is often much better than the initial design. The significant disadvantage of the spiral design process is that time and resources are required for each loop in the spiral; if these are not planned for, the project may easily be late and over budget.

In this section, we go through an example of a team using the design process. This section provides more detail about the steps of the sequential design process.

[[File:Rush hour traffic in Washington, D.C.jpg|425px|center|thumb|'''Figure 4.6''': Rush hour traffic in Washington, D.C. Heavy traffic and long delays, as well as the associated air pollution and fuel consumption, are major problems for communities.]]

==Define the Problem==
Problem definition is one of the most critical steps in the design process. Since the design team trying to solve this problem will expend a significant effort, it is very important that the problem being addressed is actually the problem that is important to potential customers. It is also important that the problem be clearly defined and understood by the design team.

Many techniques can be used to clearly define and understand the problem. These techniques include:

* gathering information from customers and other stakeholders,
* finding expert information (either in person or through books or other sources),
* doing a root cause analysis to identify what the real problem is.

The SCV design team began by gathering information about the issues associated with vehicular commuting and traffic congestion. They found and read several government reports. They interviewed various stakeholders in the commuting problem; these included people who commute to and from work in their car each day, officials from state and local departments of transportation, and representatives of environmental groups. They also used their own experience as commuters.

==Identify Criteria and Constraints==
The problem statement is used as a starting point to develop an understanding of the characteristics of a good solution. These characteristics are described in terms of constraints and criteria. A constraint is a limitation or condition that must be satisfied by a design. A criterion is a standard or attribute of a design that can be measured. The constraints and criteria are used in subsequent steps of the design process to determine which of many possible designs should be implemented.

==Generate Concepts==
With criteria and constraints identified, the design team begins to '''generate concepts''' for the design. This is the step in which creativity plays a very important role—good designs are often very different from existing solutions to a problem. In addition to creativity, the design team must use discipline to ensure that they explore enough options and potential solutions to guarantee a good design. Therefore, it is important to use a structured process to generate concepts for a design. Many different processes could be used. The one presented here is adapted and simplified from ''Product Design and Development'' by Eppinger and Ulrich. It includes the steps of problem decomposition, searching externally and internally for ideas, and systematically exploring possibilities.

===Decompose the Problem into Subproblems===
When a design problem is complex, it can be very beneficial to '''decompose''' the problem into subproblems. Subproblems are smaller problems that must be solved in order to solve the overall problem.

===Search Externally for Ideas===
Once the problem is decomposed into subproblems, the design team can begin to search for ideas to solve each subproblem. One source of ideas is to look at existing products and ideas to see whether there are already solutions to the overall problem or the identified subproblems. Sources of external information include interviews with potential customers or experts in the subproblem areas, patent and other technical databases, and existing products. Much of this information is now available on the World Wide Web.

===Search Internally for Ideas===
Searching internally for ideas is often called brainstorming. The goal of brainstorming is to develop as many ideas as possible without worrying whether they are feasible. Sketches are often good tools to capture ideas and to generate new ideas.

===Explore Systematically===
Searching externally and internally will generate many possible solutions for each of the subproblems. To ensure that good solutions are not left out of the set of possible designs, it is important to use a structured process to examine possible combinations of subproblem solutions. A tool for systematic exploration is the concept combination table. In this table, solutions for each of the subproblems are combined; Figure 7 shows a concept combination table for the commuter vehicle.

[[File:High School Engineering Figure 4.7.png|frame|center|'''Figure 4.7''': The concept combination table for the commuter vehicle.]]

To use the table, a solution for each subproblem is combined, and then a sketch or description of the resulting concept is created. For example, if the concepts are combined as shown in Figure 8, then the possible design in Figure 9 results. This design could be very similar to a standard bicycle with an added solar cell canopy that shades the driver. The pedals of the bicycle would be removed and replaced by an electric motor that drives the vehicle forward.

[[File:High School Engineering Figure 4.8.png|frame|center|'''Figure 4.8''': The concept combination table is used to generate a particular possible design.]]
[[File:Solar-powered bicycle.png|frame|center|'''Figure 4.9''': A sketch of the possible design obtained by from the concept combination table in Figure 8. Note that engineers often use rough, hand-drawn sketches at this point in the design process to understand design concepts and explore their strengths and weaknesses.]]

Note that the combination of design elements often does not provide a complete design concept; decisions must be made to fill in the gaps. For example, if solar cells are included as part of a design, they could be placed on the vehicle or they could be part of a fixed charging station that charges a battery on the vehicle; the design team must decide which configuration would make the most sense.

==Explore Possibilities and Select a Design==
The design concepts are explored to understand their characteristics. For example, exploring Concept 1, the solar-powered bicycle in Figure 9, leads to the following conclusions:

* The design would use only renewable energy.
* The design would be relatively inexpensive to manufacture and would cost nothing to operate.
* The design may not be convenient for the commuter, since the motor will only run when sunlight falls on the solar array. This means that it is impossible to commute at night or on cloudy days.
* The design will not be particularly comfortable for the commuter, since they will be exposed to hot, cold, and rainy weather, and the seat appears to be uncomfortable.

==Develop a Detailed Design==
After concept selection, the team has a general design concept; they have decided how each subproblem will be addressed and have an overall understanding of the design. Before the design can be manufactured, the team needs to develop the details of the design. A detailed design includes:

* The shapes and dimension of all physical components.
* An understanding of which components will be acquired from external vendors and which will be fabricated within the company and, if fabricated within the company, the materials and fabrication processes to be used.
* A detailed schematic diagram of any electrical subsystems and computer code for any embedded processors.
* Assembly processes.

The development of a detailed design from a design concept may occupy the majority of time allocated to a new product design project. This step will also have a significant impact on the success of the project; a poor detailed design can ruin a good design concept.

In the process of developing a detailed design, the team may use many or all of the subsequent design steps of prototyping, testing, and refinement. This process may require many iterations as the testing of prototypes reveals previously unknown characteristics of the design.

A major step in the process of going from a design concept to a detailed design is the development of the design architecture. The design architecture is &quot;the assignment of the functional elements of the product to the physical building blocks of the product&quot; (Eppinger and Ulrich, 2003).

For example, one architectural decision for the SCV design is how to incorporate the solar array into the design. Should the array be a separate physical block of the vehicle, for example creating the canopy structure in Figure 9, or should the array be created as an integral part of the frame? The first option represents a modular architecture, while the second option represents an integrated architecture.

==Prototype, Test, and Refine==
A prototype or model is a representation of some aspect of the design. The purpose of models and prototypes is to provide additional understanding of the design and its performance. A prototype may implement only a small portion of design or may be comprehensive and implement the whole design. For example, while developing a detailed design for Concept 1, the design team may initially wish to develop a prototype only of the electrical system (the solar cell array and the electric motor). Once the electrical system design is verified, they may implement a comprehensive prototype of the whole vehicle.

Prototypes may be physical or virtual. A physical prototype may be implemented out of materials that are very similar to those that will be used to manufacture the final design, or, to reduce cost or save time, the prototype may be implemented out of other materials. A virtual prototype may be created using a computer-aided design and drafting ('''CADD''') program. Modern programs can simulate many aspects of a physical system, revealing flaws or promoting understanding of the design without the need to implement it physically.

One important function of a prototype is to test whether the design will work as expected. Understanding of the design and confidence that it will work is gained as prototypes are tested and evaluated relative to the constraints and criteria for the design. Testing procedures should be carefully planned to ensure that questions about the design are answered without requiring too much time and resources. The test results should be evaluated relative to specifications that reflect the constraints and criteria.

Testing and evaluation of the prototype may reveal weaknesses in the design or may provide information that can be used to improve the design. In this case, the design will often be refined, particularly if it does poorly with respect to some of the criteria or constraints. Sometimes, the chosen design concepts do not meet the criteria or constraints, and the design team must go back and perform more concept generation and then select another concept. This is an integral part of a spiral design process.

==Communication and Implementation==
As the design team has gone through the design process, they have kept records of the different processes that they used and results of these processes. Often, this information is used to create user manuals and maintenance manuals for the product. This information is important for team members who will be required to update or modify the design in the future. Lessons are learned in the design process that should be conveyed to other teams in the company or perhaps to external stakeholders in government or academia. An important part of the design process is to document these issues and communicate the results to the
appropriate stakeholders.

As the design is completed, the effort to implement the design increases. If the design is of a product that is manufactured, a manufacturing system must be developed. For example, in the alternate commuter vehicle design, suppliers for components such as motors and solar cells must be located; facilities for manufacturing the frame are created; and a sales and marketing staff are identified.

[[Image:Appleby Castle.jpg|thumb|Caesar's Tower]]
'''Appleby Castle''' is in the town of Appleby-in-Westmorland, Cumbria overlooking the River Eden.  It consists of a 12th-century castle keep which is known as Caesar's tower, and a mansion house.   These, together with their associated buildings, are set in a courtyard surrounded by curtain walls.
The castle was founded by Ranulf le Meschin at the beginning of the 12th century. In about 1170 the square stone keep was built. The castle was in Royal hands when the Scottish King, William the Lion, invaded the Eden Valley in 1174. The constable of the castle surrendered without a fight.

In 1203 the castle was granted to Robert de Vieuxpont by King John. In 1269 it came into the possession of Roger de Clifford and it remained in the ownership of the Clifford family for nearly 400 years. The upper parts of Caesar's tower were altered in the 17th and 18th centuries.

The north wall of house and the west part of north wing with the round tower date from the 13th century. The eastern part of the house was built in 1454. The house was partly dismantled in 1648 and was restored by Lady Anne Clifford in 1651–53. The house was largely rebuilt in 1686 and the north-west wing was added in 1695. In the 19th century it was again restored and sash windows were inserted.

Caesar's tower is built in grey stone rubble and ashlar.  It is about 80 ft high and has four storeys. The main house is in two wings which are at right angles to each other.  A semicircular round tower protrudes from the north wall of the north wing and a large square tower is at the south end of the east wing. The gateway is in grey stone and battlemented, dating probably from the 17th century. In the grounds of the castle is Lady Anne's Bee-house, which was built by Lady Anne Clifford in the middle of the 17th century.  It is a square, stone building in two storeys with a pyramid roof and a door on the lower level. The upper level has a pointed arched window on each of three sides and a door on the fourth side.

[[File:The Blue Marble 4463x4163.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The Earth seen from Apollo 17. The shape of the Earth is close to a quite smooth sphere.]]
This tutorial introduces '''texture mapping'''.

It's the first in a series of tutorials about texturing in GLSL shaders in Blender. In this tutorial, we start with a single texture map on a sphere. More specifically, we map an image of the Earth's surface onto a sphere. Based on this, further tutorials cover topics such as lighting of textured surfaces, transparent textures, multitexturing, gloss mapping, etc.

[[File:WireSphereLowTass.MaxDZ8.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A triangle mesh approximating a sphere.]]
[[File:Earthmap720x360 grid.jpg|250px|thumb|left|An image of the Earth's surface. The horizontal coordinate represents the longitude, the vertical coordinate the latitude.]]
===Texture Mapping===
The basic idea of “texture mapping” (or “texturing”) is to map an image (i.e. a “texture” or a “texture map”) onto a triangle mesh; in other words, to put a flat image onto the surface of a three-dimensional shape. 

To this end, “texture coordinates” are defined, which simply specify the position in the texture (i.e. image). The horizontal coordinate is officially called &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; and the vertical coordinate &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;. However, it is very common to refer to them as &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;. In animation and modeling tools, texture coordinates are usually called &lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;.

In order to map the texture image to a mesh, every vertex of the mesh is given a pair of texture coordinates. (This process (and the result) is sometimes called “UV mapping” since each vertex is mapped to a point in the UV-space.) Thus, every vertex is mapped to a point in the texture image. The texture coordinates of the vertices can then be interpolated for each point of any triangle between three vertices and thus every point of all triangles of the mesh can have a pair of (interpolated) texture coordinates. These texture coordinates map each point of the mesh to a specific position in the texture map and therefore to the color at this position. Thus, rendering a texture-mapped mesh consists of two steps for all visible points: interpolation of texture coordinates and a look-up of the color of the texture image at the position specified by the interpolated texture coordinates.

In OpenGL, any valid floating-point number is a valid texture coordinate. However, when the GPU is asked to look up a pixel (or “texel”) of a texture image (e.g. with the “texture2D” instruction described below), it will internally map the texture coordinates to the range between 0 and 1 in a way depending on the “wrap mode”. For example, wrap mode “repeat” basically uses the fractional part of the texture coordinates to determine texture coordinates in the range between 0 and 1. On the other hand, wrap mode “clamp” clamps the texture coordinates to this range. These internal texture coordinates in the range between 0 and 1 are then used to determine the position in the texture image: &lt;math&gt;(0,0)&lt;/math&gt; specifies the lower, left corner of the texture image; &lt;math&gt;(1,0)&lt;/math&gt; the lower, right corner; &lt;math&gt;(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; the upper, left corner; etc. The OpenGL's wrap mode corresponds to Blender's settings under '''Properties &gt; Texture tab &gt; Image Mapping'''. Unfortunately, Blender doesn't appear to set the OpenGL wrap mode but it is always set to “repeat”. 

===Texturing a Sphere in Blender===
To map the image of the Earth's surface to the left onto a sphere in Blender, you first have to download this image to your computer: click the image to the left until you get to a larger version and save it (usually with a right-click) to your computer (remember where you saved it). Then switch to Blender and add a sphere (in an '''Info window''' choose '''Add &gt; Mesh &gt; UV Sphere'''), select it in the '''3D View''' (by right-clicking), activate smooth shading (in the '''Tool Shelf''' of the '''3D View''', press '''t''' if it is not active), make sure that '''Display &gt; Shading: GLSL''' is set in the '''Properties''' of the '''3D View''' (press '''n''' if they aren't displayed), '''and''' switch the '''Viewport Shading''' of the '''3D View''' to '''Textured''' (the second icon to the right of the main menu in the '''3D View'''). Now (with the sphere still being selected) add a material (in a '''Properties window &gt; Material tab &gt; New'''). Then add a new texture (in the '''Properties window &gt; Textures tab &gt; New''') and select '''Image or Movie''' for the '''Type''' and click '''Image &gt; Open'''. Select your file in the file browser and click on '''Open Image''' (or double-click it in the file browser). The image should now appear in the preview section of the '''Textures tab''' and Blender should put it onto the sphere in the 3D View. 

Now you should make sure that the '''Coordinates''' in the '''Properties window &gt; Textures tab &gt; Mapping''' are set to '''Generated'''. This means that our texture coordinates will be set to the coordinates in object space. Specifying or generating texture coordinates (i.e. UVs) in any modeling tool is a whole different topic which is well beyond the scope of this tutorial. 

With these settings, Blender will also send texture coordinates to the vertex shader. (Actually, we could also use the object coordinates in &lt;code&gt;gl_Vertex&lt;/code&gt; because they are the same in this case.) Thus, we can write a vertex shader that receives the texture coordinates and hands them through to the fragment shader. The fragment shader then does some computation on the four-dimensional texture coordinates to compute the longitude and latitude (scale to the range from 0 to 1), which will be used as texture coordinates here. Usually this step would be unnecessary since the texture coordinates should already correctly specify where to look up the texture image. (In fact, any such processing of texture coordinates in the fragment shader should be avoided for performance reasons; here I'm only using this trick to avoid setting up appropriate UV texture coordinates.) The Python script to set up the shader could be:

&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
import bge
 
cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()
 
VertexShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
   varying vec4 texCoords; // texture coordinates at this vertex
  
   void main()
   {
      texCoords = gl_MultiTexCoord0; // in this case equal to gl_Vertex
 
      gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
   }
&quot;&quot;&quot;
 
FragmentShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
   varying vec4 texCoords; 
      // interpolated texture coordinates for this fragment
   uniform sampler2D textureUnit; 
      // a small integer identifying a texture image
 
   void main()
   {
      vec2 longitudeLatitude = vec2(
        (atan(texCoords.y, texCoords.x) / 3.1415926 + 1.0) * 0.5, 
         1.0 - acos(texCoords.z) / 3.1415926);
         // processing of the texture coordinates; 
         // this is unnecessary if correct texture coordinates 
         // are specified within Blender
   
      gl_FragColor = texture2D(textureUnit, longitudeLatitude);
         // look up the color of the texture image specified 
         // by the uniform &quot;textureUnit&quot; at the position 
         // specified by &quot;longitudeLatitude.x&quot; and 
         // &quot;longitudeLatitude.y&quot; and return it in &quot;gl_FragColor&quot;        
   }
&quot;&quot;&quot;
 
mesh = cont.owner.meshes[0]
for mat in mesh.materials:
    shader = mat.getShader()
    if shader != None:
        if not shader.isValid():
            shader.setSource(VertexShader, FragmentShader, 1)
            shader.setSampler('textureUnit', 0)
&lt;/source&gt; 

Note the last line 

&lt;code&gt;            shader.setSampler('textureUnit', 0)&lt;/code&gt;

in the Python script: it sets the uniform variable &lt;code&gt;textureUnity&lt;/code&gt; to 0. This specifies that the texture should be used which is first in the list in the '''Properties window &gt; Textures tab'''. A value of 1 would select the second in the list, etc. In fact, for each &lt;code&gt;sampler2D&lt;/code&gt; variable that you use in a fragment shader, you have to set its value with a call to &lt;code&gt;setSampler&lt;/code&gt; in the Python script as shown above. Actually, a &lt;code&gt;sampler2D&lt;/code&gt; uniform specifies the texture unit of the GPU. (A texture unit is a part of the hardware that is responsible for the lookup and interpolation of colors in texture images.) The number of texure units of GPUs is available in the built-in constant &lt;code&gt;gl_MaxTextureUnits&lt;/code&gt;, which is usually 4 or 8. Thus, the number of different texture images available in a fragment shader is limited to this number. 

If everything went right, the texture image should now appear correctly mapped onto the sphere when you start the game engine by pressing '''p'''. (Otherwise Blender maps it differently onto the sphere.) Congratulations!

===How It Works===
Since many techniques use texture mapping, it pays off very well to understand what is happening here. Therefore, let's review the shader code:

The vertices of Blender's sphere object come with attribute data in &lt;code&gt;gl_MultiTexCoord0&lt;/code&gt; for each vertex, which specifies texture coordinates that are in our particular example the same values as in the attribute &lt;code&gt;gl_Vertex&lt;/code&gt;, which specifies a position in object space. 

The vertex shader then writes the texture coordinates of each vertex to the varying variable &lt;code&gt;texCoords&lt;/code&gt;. For each fragment of a triangle (i.e. each covered pixel), the values of this varying at the three triangle vertices are interpolated (see the description in [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Rasterization|“Rasterization”]]) and the interpolated texture coordinates are given to the fragment shader. In this particular example, the fragment shader computes new texture coordinates in &lt;code&gt;longitudeLatitude&lt;/code&gt;. Usually, this wouldn't be necessary because correct texture coordinates should be specified within Blender using UV mapping. The fragment shader then uses the texture coordinates to look up a color in the texture image specified by the uniform &lt;code&gt;textureUnit&lt;/code&gt; at the interpolated position in texture space and returns this color in &lt;code&gt;gl_FragColor&lt;/code&gt;, which is then written to the framebuffer and displayed on the screen.

It is crucial that you gain a good idea of these steps in order to understand the more complicated texture mapping techniques presented in other tutorials.

===Summary===
You have reached the end of one of the most important tutorials. We have looked at:
*How to set up a Blender object for texturing.
*How to import a texture image.
*How a vertex shader and a fragment shader work together to map a texture image onto a mesh.

===Further Reading===
If you want to know more 
*about the data flow in and out of vertex shaders and fragment shaders (i.e. vertex attributes, varyings, etc.), you should read the description of the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/OpenGL ES 2.0 Pipeline|“OpenGL ES 2.0 Pipeline”]].
*about the interpolation of varying variables for the fragment shader, you should read the discussion of the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Rasterization|“Rasterization”]].

[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Earthrise as seen from Apollo 8.]]
This tutorial covers '''per-vertex lighting of textured surfaces'''.

It combines the shader code of the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Textured Spheres|tutorial on textured spheres]] and the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Specular Highlights|tutorial on specular highlights]] to compute lighting with a diffuse material color determined by a texture. If you haven't read the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Textured Spheres|tutorial on textured spheres]] or the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Specular Highlights|tutorial on specular highlights]], this would be a very good opportunity to read them.

===Texturing and Diffuse Per-Vertex Lighting===
In the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Textured Spheres|tutorial on textured spheres]], the texture color was used as output of the fragment shader. However, it is also possible to use the texture color as any of the parameters in lighting computations, in particular the material constant &lt;math&gt;k_\text{diffuse}&lt;/math&gt; for diffuse reflection, which was introduced in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Diffuse Reflection|tutorial on diffuse reflection]]. It appears in the diffuse part of the Phong reflection model:

&lt;math&gt;I_\text{diffuse} = I_\text{incoming}\,k_\text{diffuse} \max(0,\mathbf{N}\cdot \mathbf{L})&lt;/math&gt;

where this equation is used with different material constants for the three color components red, green, and blue. By using a texture to determine these material constants, they can vary over the surface.

===Shader Code===
In comparison to the per-vertex lighting in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Specular Highlights|tutorial on specular highlights]], the vertex shader here computes two varying colors: &lt;code&gt;diffuseColor&lt;/code&gt; is multiplied with the texture color in the fragment shader and &lt;code&gt;specularColor&lt;/code&gt; is just the specular term, which shouldn't be multiplied with the texture color. This makes perfect sense but for historically reasons (i.e. older graphics hardware that was less capable) this is sometimes referred to as “separate specular color”. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec3 diffuseColor; 
            // the diffuse Phong lighting computed in the vertex shader
         varying vec3 specularColor; 
            // the specular Phong lighting computed in the vertex shader
         varying vec4 texCoords; // the texture coordinates 
 
         void main()
         {                              
            vec3 normalDirection = 
               normalize(gl_NormalMatrix * gl_Normal);
            vec3 viewDirection = 
               -normalize(vec3(gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex)); 
            vec3 lightDirection;
            float attenuation;
 
            if (0.0 == gl_LightSource[0].position.w) 
               // directional light?
            {
               attenuation = 1.0; // no attenuation
               lightDirection = 
                  normalize(vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position));
            } 
            else // point light or spotlight (or other kind of light) 
            {
               vec3 vertexToLightSource = 
                  vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position 
                  - gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex);
               float distance = length(vertexToLightSource);
               attenuation = 1.0 / distance; // linear attenuation 
               lightDirection = normalize(vertexToLightSource);
 
               if (gl_LightSource[0].spotCutoff &lt;= 90.0) // spotlight?
               {
                  float clampedCosine = max(0.0, dot(-lightDirection, 
                     gl_LightSource[0].spotDirection));
                  if (clampedCosine &lt; gl_LightSource[0].spotCosCutoff) 
                     // outside of spotlight cone?
                  {
                     attenuation = 0.0;
                  }
                  else
                  {
                     attenuation = attenuation * pow(clampedCosine, 
                        gl_LightSource[0].spotExponent);
                  }
               }
            }
 
            vec3 ambientLighting = vec3(gl_LightModel.ambient); 
               // without material color!
 
            vec3 diffuseReflection = attenuation 
               * vec3(gl_LightSource[0].diffuse) 
               * max(0.0, dot(normalDirection, lightDirection)); 
               // without material color!
 
            vec3 specularReflection;
            if (dot(normalDirection, lightDirection) &lt; 0.0) 
               // light source on the wrong side?
            {
               specularReflection = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0); 
                  // no specular reflection
            }
            else // light source on the right side
            {
               specularReflection = attenuation 
                  * vec3(gl_LightSource[0].specular) 
                  * vec3(gl_FrontMaterial.specular) 
                  * pow(max(0.0, dot(reflect(-lightDirection, 
                  normalDirection), viewDirection)), 
                  gl_FrontMaterial.shininess);
            }
 
            diffuseColor = ambientLighting + diffuseReflection;
            specularColor = specularReflection;
            texCoords = gl_MultiTexCoord0;
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
&lt;/source&gt;

And the fragment shader modulates the &lt;code&gt;diffuseColor&lt;/code&gt; with the texture color and adds the &lt;code&gt;specularColor&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec3 diffuseColor; 
            // the interpolated diffuse Phong lighting
         varying vec3 specularColor; 
            // the interpolated specular Phong lighting
         varying vec4 texCoords; 
            // the interpolated texture coordinates 
         uniform sampler2D textureUnit;
 
         void main()
         {
            vec2 longitudeLatitude = vec2(
              (atan(texCoords.y, texCoords.x) / 3.1415926 + 1.0) * 0.5, 
               1.0 - acos(texCoords.z) / 3.1415926);
               // unusual processing of texture coordinates

            gl_FragColor = vec4(diffuseColor 
               * vec3(texture2D(textureUnit, longitudeLatitude))
               + specularColor, 1.0);
         }
&lt;/source&gt;

In order to assign a texture image to this shader, you should follow the steps discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Textured Spheres|tutorial on textured spheres]]; in particular, the Python script has to set the value of the uniform &lt;code&gt;textureUnit&lt;/code&gt;, e.g. with:

&lt;code&gt;         shader.setSampler('textureUnit', 0)&lt;/code&gt;

===Summary===
Congratulations, you have reached the end. We have looked at:
*How texturing and per-vertex lighting are usually combined.
*What a “separate specular color” is.

[[File:Iss007e10807 darker.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Sun set with a specular highlight in the Pacific Ocean as seen from the  International Space Station (ISS).]]
This tutorial covers '''per-pixel lighting of partially glossy, textured surfaces'''.

It combines the shader code of the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Textured Spheres|tutorial on textured spheres]]  and the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Smooth Specular Highlights|tutorial on smooth specular highlights]] to compute per-pixel lighting with a material color for diffuse reflection that is determined by the RGB components of a texture and an intensity of the specular reflection that is determined by the A component of the same texture. If you haven't read the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Textured Spheres|tutorial on textured spheres]] or the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Smooth Specular Highlights|tutorial on smooth specular highlights]], this would be a very good opportunity to read them.

===Gloss Mapping===
The [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Lighting Textured Surfaces|tutorial on lighting textured surfaces]] introduced the concept of determining the material constant for the diffuse reflection by the RGB components of a texture image. Here we extend this technique and determine the strength of the specular reflection by the A (alpha) component of the same texture image. Using only one texture offers a significant performance advantage, in particular because an RGBA texture lookup is under certain circumstances just as expensive as an RGB texture lookup.

If the “gloss” of a texture image (i.e. the strength of the specular reflection) is encoded in the A (alpha) component of an RGBA texture image, we can simply multiply the material constant for the specular reflection &lt;math&gt;k_\text{specular}&lt;/math&gt; with the alpha component of the texture image. &lt;math&gt;k_\text{specular}&lt;/math&gt; was introduced in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Specular Highlights|tutorial on specular highlights]] and appears in the specular reflection term of the Phong reflection model:

&lt;math&gt;I_\text{specular} = I_\text{incoming}\,k_\text{specular} \max(0, \mathbf{R}\cdot \mathbf{V})^{n_\text{shininess}}&lt;/math&gt;

If multiplied with the alpha component of the texture image, this term reaches its maximum (i.e. the surface is glossy) where alpha is 1, and it is 0 (i.e. the surface is not glossy at all) where alpha is 0. 

[[File:Land shallow topo alpha 2048.png|250px|thumb|left|Map of the Earth with transparent water, i.e. the alpha component is 0 for water and 1 for land.]]
===Shader Code for Per-Pixel Lighting===
The shader code is a combination of the per-pixel lighting from the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Smooth Specular Highlights|tutorial on smooth specular highlights]] and the texturing from the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Textured Spheres|tutorial on textured spheres]]. Similarly to the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Lighting Textured Surfaces|tutorial on lighting textured surfaces]], the RGB components of the texture color in &lt;code&gt;textureColor &lt;/code&gt; is multiplied to the ambient and diffuse lighting. 

In the particular texture image to the left, the alpha component is 0 for water and 1 for land. However, it should be the water that is glossy and the land that isn't. Thus, with this particular image, we should multiply the specular material color with &lt;code&gt;(1.0 - textureColor.a)&lt;/code&gt;. On the other hand, usual gloss maps would require a multiplication with &lt;code&gt;textureColor.a&lt;/code&gt;. (Note how easy it is to make this kind of changes to a shader program.)

The vertex shader is then:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec4 position; 
            // position of the vertex (and fragment) in view space 
         varying vec3 varyingNormalDirection; 
            // surface normal vector in view space
         varying vec4 texCoords; // the texture coordinates 

         void main()
         {                              
            position = gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex; 
            varyingNormalDirection = 
               normalize(gl_NormalMatrix * gl_Normal);             

            texCoords = gl_MultiTexCoord0;
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
&lt;/source&gt;
And the fragment shader becomes:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         varying vec4 position; 
            // position of the vertex (and fragment) in view space 
         varying vec3 varyingNormalDirection; 
            // surface normal vector in view space
         varying vec4 texCoords; // interpolated texture coordinates 
         uniform sampler2D textureUnit;

         void main()
         {
            vec3 normalDirection = normalize(varyingNormalDirection);
            vec3 viewDirection = -normalize(vec3(position)); 
            vec3 lightDirection;
            float attenuation; 

            vec2 longitudeLatitude = vec2(
               (atan(texCoords.y, texCoords.x)/3.1415926+1.0)*0.5, 
               1.0 - acos(texCoords.z) / 3.1415926);
               // unusual processing of texture coordinates

            vec4 textureColor = 
               texture2D(textureUnit, longitudeLatitude);
            
            if (0.0 == gl_LightSource[0].position.w) 
               // directional light?
            {
               attenuation = 1.0; // no attenuation
               lightDirection = 
                  normalize(vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position));
            } 
            else // point light or spotlight (or other kind of light) 
            {
               vec3 positionToLightSource = 
                  vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position - position);
               float distance = length(positionToLightSource);
               attenuation = 1.0 / distance; // linear attenuation 
               lightDirection = normalize(positionToLightSource);
 
               if (gl_LightSource[0].spotCutoff &lt;= 90.0) // spotlight?
               {
                  float clampedCosine = max(0.0, dot(-lightDirection, 
                     gl_LightSource[0].spotDirection));
                  if (clampedCosine &lt; gl_LightSource[0].spotCosCutoff) 
                     // outside of spotlight cone?
                  {
                     attenuation = 0.0;
                  }
                  else
                  {
                     attenuation = attenuation * pow(clampedCosine, 
                        gl_LightSource[0].spotExponent);   
                  }
               }
            }

            vec3 ambientLighting = vec3(gl_LightModel.ambient) 
               * vec3(textureColor);
              
            vec3 diffuseReflection = attenuation 
               * vec3(gl_LightSource[0].diffuse) * vec3(textureColor)
               * max(0.0, dot(normalDirection, lightDirection));
 
            vec3 specularReflection;
            if (dot(normalDirection, lightDirection) &lt; 0.0) 
               // light source on the wrong side?
            {
               specularReflection = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0); 
                  // no specular reflection
            }
            else // light source on the right side
            {
               specularReflection = attenuation 
                  * vec3(gl_LightSource[0].specular) 
                  * vec3(gl_FrontMaterial.specular) 
                  * (1.0 - textureColor.a) 
                     // for usual gloss maps: &quot;* textureColor.a&quot;
                  * pow(max(0.0, dot(reflect(-lightDirection, 
                  normalDirection), viewDirection)), 
                  gl_FrontMaterial.shininess);
            }

            gl_FragColor = vec4(ambientLighting + diffuseReflection 
               + specularReflection, 1.0);
         }
&lt;/source&gt;
The texture and sphere have to be set up as described in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Textured Spheres|tutorial on textured spheres]]. This tutorial also explains how to set the uniform variable &lt;code&gt;textureUnit&lt;/code&gt; in a Python script. 

A useful modification of this shader for the particular texture image above, would be to set the diffuse material color to a dark blue where the alpha component is 0.

===Shader Code for Per-Vertex Lighting===
As discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Smooth Specular Highlights|tutorial on smooth specular highlights]], specular highlights are usually not rendered very well with per-vertex lighting. Sometimes, however, there is no choice because of performance limitations. In order to include gloss mapping in the shader code of the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Lighting Textured Surfaces|tutorial on lighting textured surfaces]], the fragment shader should be replaced with this code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            varying diffuseColor;
            varying specularColor;
            varying vec4 texCoords;
            uniform sampler2D textureUnit;
 
            void main()
            {
               vec2 longitudeLatitude = vec2(
                   (atan(texCoords.y, texCoords.x)/3.1415926+1.0)*0.5, 
                   1.0 - acos(texCoords.z) / 3.1415926);
               vec4 textureColor = 
                  texture2D(textureUnit, longitudeLatitude);
               gl_FragColor = vec4(diffuseColor * vec3(textureColor)
                  + specularColor * (1.0 - textureColor.a), 1.0);
            }
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that a usual gloss map would require a multiplication with &lt;code&gt;textureColor.a&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;(1.0 - textureColor.a)&lt;/code&gt;.

===Summary===
Congratulations! You finished an important tutorial about gloss mapping. We have looked at:

A newspaper article, dated June 12, 1929, in The Weems Weekly announces the opening of the Whistle Stop Cafe. The cafe is located next to the post office and is run by Idgie Threadgoode and Ruth Jameson. Sipsey and Onzell, two colored women, are doing the cooking, so customers won't have to worry about being poisoned by Idgie. The breakfast and lunch menus are listed with prices. Dot Weems, the writer of the article, tells her readers that her husband, Wilbur, ate there and he told Dot he may never eat at home again. Dot tells readers she wishes this were true.

This chapter takes place on December 15, 1985 in Rose Terrace Nursing Home in Birmingham, Alabama. Evelyn Couch is at the nursing home visiting her mother in law with her husband Ed. Evelyn escapes her husband and mother in law and goes to the lounge. When she sits down, the old woman next to her begins to talk. Mrs. Threadgoode is eighty-six years old, but says she didn't realize how old she was until last June when she was in the hospital for gallbladder surgery and saw her age on her armband.

Mrs. Threadgoode tells Evelyn she is only in the nursing home temporarily until her friend, Mrs. Otis gets settled in, and then she is going home to Whistle Stop.

An article in The Weems Weekly dated October 8, 1929 with the headline, &quot;Meteorite hits Whistle Stop residence.&quot; The meteorite hit the roof of Mrs. Biddie Otis's house, leaving a four-foot hole in the roof and destroying her radio, the article states. Other news items include an announcement of the wedding anniversary of Bertha and Howard Vick.

This chapter takes the reader back to the Rose Terrace Nursing Home. Mrs. Threadgoode is still talking. Evelyn is still eating candy and wondering when Mrs. Threadgoode will shut up. She is talking about the Threadgoode home in Whistle Stop and recalling the fond memories of new babies over the years. She describes the two-story house with the railroad tracks running through the front yard. She tells Evelyn that her first name is Virginia, but everyone calls her Ninny. She had liked all the Threadgoode boys, but had married Cleo. She tells Evelyn this worked out well because he was a chiropractor and she had a bad back.

Ninny spent so much time at the cafe that Cleo once asked her if she didn't have anything better to do.

An article in The Weems Weekly dated October 15, 1929 carries the headline, &quot;Ownership of Meteorite Questioned.&quot; Mrs. Otis claims ownership of the object because it broke her radio, but Mrs. Vesta Adcock and her son claim they own it because they own the house it hit. Dot Weems tells her readers times are getting tough. Her evidence for this statement is that five new hobos have been seen at the cafe.

== Analysis ==

The date of this article is just before the stock market crash of 1929 that signaled the beginning of the Great Depression. Even before the crash, the economy was sinking. More people out of work led to more hobos looking for work and food.

This chapter takes place in a hobo camp in Davenport Iowa on October 15, 1929, the same date as the newspaper article in the previous chapter. Five men are sitting by a campfire. One of these men is Jim Smokey Phillips. These men are five of about 200,000 men roaming the country in search of work that year. The impending winter makes Smokey decide to start heading south.

Smokey's background is revealed in this chapter. His mother was a devout Baptist prone to speaking in tongues, while his father was an alcoholic who made his own moonshine. His mother told church members his father was possessed by the devil and they came and led him away at gunpoint. Smokey never saw his father again. His mother became more involved with her extremely fundamentalist religion, which included snake handling. This ended in her death by rattlesnake bite

An article in The Weems Weekly dated October 22, 1929 with the headline &quot;Meteorite on Display at Cafe.&quot; The meteorite has been attracting so much attention that Mrs. Otis has decided to move it to the cafe. Idgie will place it on the counter for anyone wanting to see it. There is a death notice for Bessie Vick, 98 years old. Old age is suspected as the cause of death. There is no other news because Dot's husband has the flu.

== Analysis ==

The Whistle Stop cafe has become the center of life in the town. Every article to this point has talked about either the cafe or Idgie. The newspaper is more of a hobby to Dot than a job. Her first responsibilities are to her job in the post office and caring for her sick husband.

[[File:Land shallow topo alpha 2048.png|250px|thumb|left|Map of the Earth with transparent water, i.e. the alpha component is 0 for water and 1 for land.]]
This tutorial covers various common uses of '''alpha texture maps''', i.e. RGBA texture images with an A (alpha) component that specifies the opacity of texels. 

It combines the shader code of the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Textured Spheres|tutorial on textured spheres]] with concepts that were introduced in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Cutaways|tutorial on cutaways]] and the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Transparency|tutorial on transparency]].

If you haven't read these tutorials, this would be a very good opportunity to read them.

===Discarding Transparent Fragments===
Let's start with discarding fragments as explained in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Cutaways|tutorial on cutaways]]. Follow the steps described in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Textured Spheres|tutorial on textured spheres]] and assign the image to the left to the material of a sphere with the following shader:

&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
import bge
 
cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()
 
VertexShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
   varying vec4 texCoords; // texture coordinates at this vertex
 
   void main()
   {
      texCoords = gl_MultiTexCoord0; // in this case equal to gl_Vertex
      gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
   }
&quot;&quot;&quot;
 
FragmentShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
   uniform float cutoff;

   varying vec4 texCoords; 
      // interpolated texture coordinates for this fragment
   uniform sampler2D textureUnit; 
      // a small integer identifying a texture image
 
   void main()
   {
      vec2 longitudeLatitude = vec2(
         (atan(texCoords.y, texCoords.x) / 3.1415926 + 1.0) * 0.5, 
         1.0 - acos(texCoords.z) / 3.1415926);
         // processing of the texture coordinates; 
         // this is unnecessary if correct texture coordinates 
         // are specified within Blender
 
      gl_FragColor = texture2D(textureUnit, longitudeLatitude);

      if (gl_FragColor.a &lt; cutoff)
         // alpha value less than user-specified threshold?
      {
         discard; // yes: discard this fragment
      }
   }
&quot;&quot;&quot;
 
mesh = cont.owner.meshes[0]
for mat in mesh.materials:
    shader = mat.getShader()
    if shader != None:
        if not shader.isValid():
            shader.setSource(VertexShader, FragmentShader, 1)
            shader.setSampler('textureUnit', 0)
            shader.setUniform1f('cutoff', cont.owner.get('cutoff'))
&lt;/source&gt;

This script uses a game property called &lt;code&gt;cutoff&lt;/code&gt; to control the uniform variable of the same name. If you start the game, Blender should complain in the system console (available via '''Help &gt; Toggle System Console''' in the menu of an '''Info window''') about a missing floating-point value in the line

&lt;code&gt;            shader.setUniform1f('cutoff', cont.owner.get('cutoff'))&lt;/code&gt;
 
because we haven't defined the game property yet. To do so, go to the '''Logic Editor''' and click on '''Add Game Property''' (open the '''Properties''' by pressing '''n''' if they aren't opened already). The name should be &lt;code&gt;cutoff&lt;/code&gt; and the type should be &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;. Set the value to &lt;math&gt;0.5&lt;/math&gt; (anything a bit away from 0 and 1 will do). 

If you start the game engine now, the fragment shader should read the RGBA texture and compare the alpha value against the threshold specified in the game property &lt;code&gt;cutoff&lt;/code&gt;. If the alpha value is less than the threshold, the fragment is discarded and the surface appears transparent.

Since we can look through the transparent parts, it makes sense to deactivate backface culling as described in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Cutaways|tutorial on cutaways]]: choose the '''Blender Game''' engine in the menu of an '''Info window''' and then (in the '''Material tab''' of the '''Properties window''' of the sphere) uncheck '''Game Settings &gt; Backface Culling'''. (Note that the usual depth test makes sure that the triangle occlusions are correct, even without checking '''Transparency''' in the '''Material tab'''.)

===Blending===
The [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Transparency|tutorial on transparency]] described how to render semitransparent objects with alpha blending. Combining this with an RGBA texture results in this fragment shader (with the same vertex shader as above):

&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
import bge
 
cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()
 
VertexShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
   varying vec4 texCoords; // texture coordinates at this vertex
 
   void main()
   {
      texCoords = gl_MultiTexCoord0; // in this case equal to gl_Vertex
      gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
   }
&quot;&quot;&quot;
 
FragmentShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
   uniform float cutoff;

   varying vec4 texCoords; 
      // interpolated texture coordinates for this fragment
   uniform sampler2D textureUnit; 
      // a small integer identifying a texture image
 
   void main()
   {
      vec2 longitudeLatitude = vec2(
         (atan(texCoords.y, texCoords.x) / 3.1415926 + 1.0) * 0.5, 
         1.0 - acos(texCoords.z) / 3.1415926);
 
      gl_FragColor = texture2D(textureUnit, longitudeLatitude);
   }
&quot;&quot;&quot;
 
mesh = cont.owner.meshes[0]
for mat in mesh.materials:
    shader = mat.getShader()
    if shader != None:
        if not shader.isValid():
            shader.setSource(VertexShader, FragmentShader, 1)
            shader.setSampler('textureUnit', 0)
            mat.setBlending(bge.logic.BL_SRC_ALPHA, 
                            bge.logic.BL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)
&lt;/source&gt;

Unfortunately, you will see severe rendering artifacts in Blender 2.63 if you deactivate backface culling, even if '''Transparency &gt; Z Transparency''' is activated (in the '''Material tab''' of the '''Properties window'''). Apparently, Blender 2.63 doesn't always sort all triangles according to their depth, which is a problem in this case. 

Note that all texels with an alpha value of 0 are black in this particular texture image. In fact, the colors in this texture image are “premultiplied” with their alpha value. (Such colors are also called “opacity-weighted.”) Thus, for this particular image, we should actually specify the blend equation for premultiplied colors in order to avoid another multiplication of the colors with their alpha value in the blend equation. Therefore, an improvement of the shader (for this particular texture image) is to employ the following blend specification:

&lt;code&gt;mat.setBlending(bge.logic.BL_ONE, bge.logic.BL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)&lt;/code&gt;

[[File:Globe.svg|150px|thumb|left|Semitransparent globes are often used for logos and trailers.]]
===Blending with Customized Colors===
We should not end this tutorial without a somewhat more practical application of the presented techniques. To the left is an image of a globe with semitransparent blue oceans, which I found on Wikimedia Commons. There is some lighting (or silhouette enhancement) going on, which I didn't try to reproduce. Instead, I only tried to reproduce the basic idea of semitransparent oceans with the following shader, which ignores the RGB colors of the texture map and replaces them by specific colors based on the alpha value:

&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
import bge
 
cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()
 
VertexShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
   varying vec4 texCoords; // texture coordinates at this vertex
 
   void main()
   {
      texCoords = gl_MultiTexCoord0; // in this case equal to gl_Vertex
      gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
   }
&quot;&quot;&quot;
 
FragmentShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
   uniform float cutoff;

   varying vec4 texCoords; 
      // interpolated texture coordinates for this fragment
   uniform sampler2D textureUnit; 
      // a small integer identifying a texture image
 
   void main()
   {
      vec2 longitudeLatitude = vec2(
         (atan(texCoords.y, texCoords.x) / 3.1415926 + 1.0) * 0.5, 
         1.0 - acos(texCoords.z) / 3.1415926);
 
      gl_FragColor = texture2D(textureUnit, longitudeLatitude);
      if (gl_FragColor.a &gt; 0.5) // opaque 
      {
         gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0); // opaque green
      }
      else // transparent 
      {
         gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.7); 
            // semitransparent dark blue
      }
   }
&quot;&quot;&quot;
 
mesh = cont.owner.meshes[0]
for mat in mesh.materials:
    shader = mat.getShader()
    if shader != None:
        if not shader.isValid():
            shader.setSource(VertexShader, FragmentShader, 1)
            shader.setSampler('textureUnit', 0)
            mat.setBlending(bge.logic.BL_SRC_ALPHA, 
                            bge.logic.BL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)
&lt;/source&gt;

If you deactivate backface culling, you will notice that there are rendering artifacts in Blender 2.63. Hopefully, this issue will be improved in coming versions.

Of course, it would be interesting to add lighting and silhouette enhancement to this shader. One could also change the opaque, green color in order to take the texture color into account, e.g. with:

&lt;code&gt;gl_FragColor = vec4(0.5 * gl_FragColor.r, 2.0 * gl_FragColor.g, 0.5 * gl_FragColor.b, 1.0);&lt;/code&gt;

which emphasizes the green component by multiplying it with &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; and dims the red and blue components by multiplying them with &lt;math&gt;0.5&lt;/math&gt;. However, this results in oversaturated green that is clamped to the maximum intensity. This can be avoided by halvening the difference of the green component to the maximum intensity 1. This difference is &lt;code&gt;1.0 - gl_FragColor.g&lt;/code&gt;; half of it is &lt;code&gt;0.5 * (1.0 - gl_FragColor.g)&lt;/code&gt; and the value corresponding to this reduced distance to the maximum intensity is: &lt;code&gt;1.0 - 0.5 * (1.0 - gl_FragColor.g)&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, in order to avoid oversaturation of green, we could use (instead of the opaque green color):

&lt;code&gt;gl_FragColor = vec4(0.5 * gl_FragColor.r, 1.0 - 0.5 * (1.0 - gl_FragColor.g), 0.5 * gl_FragColor.b, 1.0);&lt;/code&gt;

In practice, one has to try various possibilities for such color transformations. To this end, the use of numeric shader properties (e.g. for the factors 0.5 in the line above) is particularly useful to interactively explore the possibilities.

===Summary===
Congratulations! You have reached the end of this rather long tutorial. We have looked at:
*How discarding fragments can be combined with alpha texture maps.
*How alpha texture maps can be used for blending.
*How alpha texture maps can be used to determine colors.

===Further Reading===
If you still want to know more

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Regency transistor radio.jpg|200px|thumb|'''Figure 5.1''': A portable transistor radio. The world’s first transistor radio, the Regency TR-1 weighed 12 ounces with dimensions of 3&quot; × 5&quot; × 1&quot;.]]

Imagine that it is November 1, 1954 and Dwight &quot;Ike&quot; Eisenhower is president and Leo Durocher's Brooklyn Giants have just swept the World Series from the Cleveland Indians. Willie Mays has become a World Series legend after making &quot;The Catch&quot; in center field over his head with his back to the infield. Today, you have also just purchased a Regency TR-1 (Figure 1), the world's first &quot;pocket&quot; radio. It cost $49.95 (equivalent to $400 in 2007 dollars) with its four transistors, and you are now listening to Elvis Presley's first hit, &quot;That's All Right&quot;. The radio is gray, weighs 12 ounces, and with a size of 3&quot; × 5&quot; × 1&quot;, you could slip it right into your pocket. This is a lot more convenient than the old vacuum tube portable radios which were bigger, bulkier, and heavier than the new transistor radio. One of these is an RCA 66BX, a six-tube portable radio that weighed 3 pounds and was 7&quot; × 5&quot; × 2&quot; in size. Where did this incredible piece of shrinking technology come from? We shall see.

The basic scientific knowledge necessary to develop a transistor radio started from the time when, on December 14, 1900, German physicist Max Planck explained to the world how an atom's electrons behaved with a new theory called quantum mechanics. Over the next 20 years a '''mathematical model''' was developed for this theory, including an important equation called Schrödinger's equation. From there, it was these basic principles of science and mathematics directed toward their practical application in electrical devices that led three researchers at Bell Labs on a race. The race was to '''invent''' a solid-state device that would replace bulky, unreliable, and energy-consuming vacuum tubes used in consumer electronics (such as radios) at the time. So it was that, on October 16, 1947, physicists John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley, applied the mathematics and science of quantum physics to '''semiconductors''' to invent the world’s first transistor. They had created a device that could amplify a weak electronic signal 18 times over a wide range of frequencies. For their efforts they received the Nobel Prize in 1956.

Now that this new device existed, how would it be used? Texas Instruments used special materials processing techniques to make very pure semiconductor material necessary for transistors and started manufacturing them by 1952. Using those transistors, which cost $2.50 each ($2.50 will buy 100 million transistors on an integrated circuit today), engineers at the Regency Division of IDEA (Industrial Development Engineering Associates) of Indianapolis, Indiana, used the engineering design process to design, develop, and fabricate the world's first pocket radio. The electrical engineers at Regency used their industrial experience and the knowledge from their education on physics, mathematics, engineering science and electrical engineering to design a small radio; 100,000 units were manufactured. The connections of science and math to engineering are clear. The understanding of a phenomenon of the natural world, quantum physics, and the mathematical modeling of the phenomenon promoted the insights on the electrical behavior of semiconducting materials. It was the three researchers at Bell Labs who were searching for a solution to the well-defined problem of poor electrical behavior of vacuum tubes that led the team to invent the transistor. It was a very practical device indeed, since materials engineers at Texas Instruments were able to produce transistors in quantity so that another team of electrical engineers at
IDEA could design, develop, and manufacture that first pocket radio.

The above case history of the first transistor radio illustrates the interplay of math, science, and engineering that occur in commercialization of a new device that later thrilled the country. And it did not take long for society to realize the benefits of quantum mechanics, Schrödinger's equation, and the invention of the transistor. You could see it on some playgrounds a year after the Regency TR-1 was first merchandized. A crowd gathered around kids that brought their dads' pocket radios to listen to the '55 World Series when the Brooklyn Dodgers beat the New Yankees in seven games. That miraculous little radio
was a reflection of the &quot;can do&quot; spirit of the decade of the 1950s. Engineering could make science fiction reality. At the time cartoon detective character Dick Tracy had an imagined video-walkie-talkie-computer wrist watch, which he used to run down the city's criminals. Part of it became a reality but now, a half century later, today's high tech embodiment of Tracy's watch, the iPhone, can do everything Tracy's watch did and more. Next, let us consider the impact of technology in your own life from the exercise below.

This chapter has already introduced some ways in which science and math are connected to engineering. The chapter will continue to explore these connections in '''invention''', '''innovation''', education, careers, and design, as well as the impact on our daily lives. It is also becoming clear why it is critical to prepare for engineering education in college by taking and doing well in science and math courses throughout elementary, middle, and high school. In fact, the single best indicator of success in graduating with a college degree in engineering, science or math is taking courses in high school that include four years of math (at least through trigonometry) and three years of lab science. In the remainder of this chapter, we will now expand, articulate, detail, and exercise the engineering–math–science connection.
The techniques of mathematics and the phenomena of science are like the brushes and colors on an artist's palette. Just as an artist creates a new reality with his/her painting, so does an engineer create a new reality for how individuals live in a society. We have seen an example of this not only with the creation of the first pocket radio, but also how the reality of our daily lives have been impacted by other artifacts such as the cell phone and the computer. The next section will examine in greater detail the nature of the connection between math, science, and engineering.

==What Is Engineering?==
Engineering creates valued products such as the pocket radio. This is done by analyzing the nature of a problem or a need and then applying knowledge of math and science while completing the engineering design process to develop a solution to the design problem. A knowledge of science (e.g., chemistry, physics, and biology) helps the engineer understand the '''constraints''' inherent in a problem and helps the engineer develop possible approaches for a solution. Math (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus, computer computation) is used both as a tool to create mathematical models that describe physical phenomena and as a tool to evaluate the merit of different possible solutions.

The profession of engineering is more formally defined by ABET, an organization that '''accredits''' college engineering programs, as &quot;Engineering design is the process of devising a '''system''', '''component''', or process to meet desired needs. It is a decision-making process (often '''iterative'''), in which the basic sciences, mathematics, and the engineering sciences are applied to convert resources optimally to meet these stated needs&quot;. Within this definition, science and mathematics are described as an essential part of the entire engineering process. They do not act alone within this process. &quot;Engineers apply the principles of science and math to develop economical solutions to technical problems. Their work is the link between perceived social needs and commercial application&quot;. (US Department of Labor) The goals of math and of science in engineering differ from those within the field of mathematics (where the goal is to quantitatively represent functional relationships) or the field of science (where the goal is to understand the natural world). In engineering, math and science are tools used within the engineering design process. Using the design process to address a problem or an issue leads to the solution of the problem and a product which might be a component, a system, or a process that fulfills a need that will benefit society. All fields of engineering use the tools of both math and science throughout all steps of the engineering design process. Effective use of math and science are critical to creating a high-quality solution to a need and an associated product of the process.

It often occurs that a high-quality product that comes out of an effective design process (including math and science) is taken for granted, such as a bridge standing for decades or centuries with no problems. Such a situation is illustrated with the Golden Gate Bridge, which has stood for more than seven decades since it was opened on May 27, 1937 (Figure 3). When an inferior solution comes out of a flawed design process, catastrophe may result, and a bridge may collapse with possible loss of lives. Such an occurrence is illustrated below by the Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse (Figure 3). On November 11, 1940, this bridge, located at Puget Sound, Washington, began swaying strongly in the wind and eventually broke up due to the resonance of the bridge which twisted until it broke up. There are mathematical tools available to analyze for waves and resonance of structures, but they were not applied in the design process of the bridge. This demonstrates the importance and need to broadly explore and utilize mathematics and science appropriate to the engineering design problem at hand.

There have been many other disasters that occurred because of a flawed design process. One is the consecutive crashes of two British Comet jets in 1954. Go to the two web sites that describe the investigation and the resulting design changes: [[w:De_Havilland_Comet|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet]] and http://judkins.customer.netspace.net.au/comet.htm.

==What Is Science?==
The meaning of what science is can be debated and has changed over time. It is reasonable to think today of science as a process by which humans try to understand how the natural world works and how it came to be that way. The branches of science most frequently used by engineers include physics, chemistry, and biology. This is reflected by the fact that almost all undergraduate engineering programs require students to take foundational courses in those subjects. An example of how such science connects to engineering can be shown with the global problem of the lack of access to clean water by populations in some of the developing countries around the world. In developed countries turning on the bathroom faucet gives safe and drinkable water gushing from the tap. This safe and convenient water is actually a luxury that is not present everywhere. When it is not available, and water is not purified, people can become sick or even die from causes such as dehydration, cholera, dysentery, and cancer. So how have engineers figured out how to find, transport, purify, sanitize, and deliver water to those who need it? The following example should help answer that question as well as give a concrete example of how science connects with engineering.

Although more than half of the surface of the earth is covered with water, it is not accessible to plants, animals, or humans because of its 3–4% salt content. So, can we just remove the salt? No, because it is not so easy and can be costly. Science provides a variety of phenomena that can be used to desalinate water, and a few will be presented here. Chemistry tells us that there are many ways to desalinate water. One of the ways that water can be purified is by evaporation and condensation, which leaves the impurities in the original water. Another way is that, in freezing water the ice leaves the impurities behind in the unfrozen liquid. Another way is based on the fact that certain pore sizes of molecular membranes will allow water to diffuse through the membrane under pressure while leaving behind larger complexes of sodium and chlorine. Chemistry also has data on a variety of physical properties of water and salt water, including the thermodynamic data of heat of evaporation, heat of condensation, and heat of freezing. So what can be done with the different phenomena and all the data that are available?

The first question to answer is: Are there any types of engineering fields with individuals that work with such phenomena and data with the goal of desalinating water? The answer is yes. Chemical engineers are trained to use such phenomena and data to design and build large-scale processing plants for producing products such as cosmetics, antibiotics, and gasoline as well as purified water. Today, millions of gallons of water are being desalinated by flash evaporation, which uses evaporation and condensation phenomena, and by reverse osmosis, which uses molecular membrane technology based on membrane diffusion principles. A nuclear driven flash evaporation plant located on the Caspian Sea is shown in Figure 4.

[[File:Shevchenko BN350 desalinati.jpg|frame|center|'''Figure 5.4''': Nuclear powered flash distillation desalination equipment located on the Caspian Sea.]]

==What Is Mathematics?==
Math is utilized in a variety of ways within many fields of engineering. The most crucial aspects of math within this field involve cost–benefit–risk analysis and the use of mathematical models. &quot;Mathematical models may include a set of rules and instructions that specifies precisely a series of steps to be taken, whether the steps are arithmetic, logical, or geometric. Sometimes even very simple rules and instructions can have consequences that are difficult to predict without actually carrying out the steps. … Often, it is fairly easy to find a mathematical model that fits a phenomenon over a small range of conditions … but it may not fit well over a wide range&quot;. (AAAS) Given the importance of having an end result that not only works, but also is safe and dependable, it is easy to understand why the use of mathematical models is an invaluable aspect of the engineering design process, as well as how these models would be applied to various steps within this process. Nearly every aspect of mathematics can be, and is, applied to the engineering design process in some way. All fields within engineering require an advanced knowledge of, and the ability to properly use, many math skills, including (but not limited to) algebra, calculus, geometry, measurements, tables and graphic representations of results, mathematical formulas, and time lines.

[[File:Skin.png|250px|thumb|left|Layers of human skin.]]
This tutorial introduces '''multitexturing''', i.e. the use of multiple texture images in a shader. 

It extends the shader code of the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Textured Spheres|tutorial on textured spheres]] to multiple textures and shows a way of combining them. If you haven't read that tutorials, this would be a very good opportunity to read it.

===Layers of Surfaces===
Many real surfaces (e.g. the human skin illustrated in the image to the left) consist of several layers of different colors, transparencies, reflectivities, etc. If the topmost layer is opaque and doesn't transmit any light, this doesn't really matter for rendering the surface. However, in many cases the topmost layer is (semi)transparent and therefore an accurate rendering of the surface has to take multiple layers into account. 

In fact, the specular reflection that is included in the Phong reflection model (see the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Specular Highlights|tutorial on specular highlights]]) often corresponds to a transparent layer that reflects light: sweat on human skin, wax on fruits, transparent plastics with embedded pigment particles, etc. On the other hand, the diffuse reflection corresponds to the layer(s) below the topmost transparent layer. 

Lighting such layered surfaces doesn't require a geometric model of the layers: they can be represented by a single, infinitely thin polygon mesh. However, the lighting computation has to compute different reflections for different layers and has to take the transmission of light between layers into account (both when light enters the layer and when it exits the layer). Examples of this approach are included in the “Dawn” demo by Nvidia (see Chapter 3 of the book “GPU Gems”, which is available [http://developer.nvidia.com/node/108 online]) and the “Human Head” demo by Nvidia (see Chapter 14 of the book “GPU Gems 3”, which is also available [http://developer.nvidia.com/node/171 online]).

A full description of these processes is beyond the scope of this tutorial. Suffice to say that layers are often associated with texture images to specify their characteristics. Here we just show how to use two textures and one particular way of combining them. The example is in fact not related to layers and therefore illustrates that multitexturing has more applications than layers of surfaces.

[[File:Earthlights dmsp.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Map of the unlit Earth.]]
[[File:Land shallow topo 2048.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Map of the sunlit Earth.]]
===Lit and Unlit Earth===
Due to human activities, the unlit side of the Earth is not completely dark. Instead, artificial lights mark the position and extension of cities as shown in the image to the left. Therefore, diffuse lighting of the Earth should not just dim the texture image for the sunlit surface but actually blend it to the unlit texture image. Note that the sunlit Earth is far brighter than human-made lights on the unlit side; however, we reduce this contrast in order to show off the nighttime texture.

The shader code extends the code from the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Textured Spheres|tutorial on textured spheres]] to two texture images and uses the computation described in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Diffuse Reflection|tutorial on diffuse reflection]] for a single, directional light source:

&lt;math&gt;I_\text{diffuse} = I_\text{incoming}\,k_\text{diffuse} \max(0,\mathbf{N}\cdot \mathbf{L})&lt;/math&gt;

According to this equation, the level of diffuse lighting &lt;code&gt;levelOfLighting&lt;/code&gt; is max(0, '''N'''·'''L'''). We then blend the colors of the daytime texture and the nighttime texture based on &lt;code&gt;levelOfLighting&lt;/code&gt;. This could be achieved by multiplying the daytime color with &lt;code&gt;levelOfLighting&lt;/code&gt; and multiplying the nighttime color with &lt;code&gt;1.0 - levelOfLighting&lt;/code&gt; before adding them to determine the fragment's color. Alternatively, the built-in GLSL function &lt;code&gt;mix&lt;/code&gt; can be used (&lt;code&gt;mix(a, b, w) = b*w + a*(1.0-w)&lt;/code&gt;), which is likely to be more efficient. Thus, the fragment shader could be (again with our particular computation of texture coordinates in &lt;code&gt;longitudeLatitude&lt;/code&gt;):
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         void main()
         {
            vec2 longitudeLatitude = vec2(
               (atan(texCoords.y, texCoords.x)/3.1415926+1.0)*0.5, 
               1.0 - acos(texCoords.z) / 3.1415926);

            nighttimeColor = 
               texture2D(nighttimeTexture, longitudeLatitude);    
            daytimeColor = 
               texture2D(daytimeTexture, longitudeLatitude);    
            gl_FragColor = mix(nighttimeColor, daytimeColor, 
               levelOfLighting);
               // = daytimeColor * levelOfLighting 
               // + nighttimeColor * (1.0 - levelOfLighting)
         }
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that this blending is very similar to the alpha blending that was discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Transparency|tutorial on transparency]] except that we perform the blending inside a fragment shader and use &lt;code&gt;levelOfLighting&lt;/code&gt; instead of the alpha component (i.e. the opacity) of the texture that should be blended “over” the other texture. In fact, if &lt;code&gt;daytimeTexture&lt;/code&gt; specified an alpha component (see the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Transparent Textures|tutorial on transparent textures]]), we could use this alpha component to blend &lt;code&gt;daytimeTexture&lt;/code&gt; over &lt;code&gt;nighttimeTexture&lt;/code&gt;. This would correspond to a layer which is partially transparent on top of an opaque layer that is visible where the topmost layer is transparent.

===Complete Shader Code===
The shader code multiplies &lt;code&gt;gl_FrontMaterial.emission&lt;/code&gt; component-wise to the texture color of the nighttime texture in order to make it possible to control its overall brightness by changing '''Shading &gt; Emit''' in the '''Material tab''' of the '''Properties window'''. Furthermore, the color of the light source &lt;code&gt;gl_LightSource[0].diffuse&lt;/code&gt; is multiplied (also component-wise) to the final color in order to take colored light sources into account. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;

When using this shader, you have to make sure that the texture for daytime is in the first position of the list in the '''Properties window &gt; Textures tab''' and the texture for nighttime is in the second position. Otherwise you have to adapt the integers in the last two lines of the Python script.

===Summary===
Congratulations! You have reached the end of the last tutorial on basic texturing. We have looked at:
*How layers of surfaces can influence the appearance of materials (e.g. human skin, waxed fruits, plastics, etc.)
*How artificial lights on the unlit side can be taken into account when texturing a sphere representing the Earth.
*How to implement this technique in a shader.
*How this is related to blending an alpha texture over a second opaque texture.

===Further Reading===
If you still want to know more
*about basic texturing, you should read the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Textured Spheres|tutorial on textured spheres]].
*about diffuse reflection, you should read the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Diffuse Reflection|tutorial on diffuse reflection]].
*about alpha textures, you should read the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Transparent Textures|tutorial on transparent textures]].
*about advanced skin rendering, you could read Chapter 3 “Skin in the ‘Dawn’ Demo” by Curtis Beeson and Kevin Bjorke of the book “GPU Gems” by Randima Fernando (editor) published 2004 by Addison-Wesley, which is available [http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch03.html online], and Chapter 14 “Advanced Techniques for Realistic Real-Time Skin Rendering” by Eugene d’Eon and David Luebke of the book “GPU Gems 3” by Hubert Nguyen (editor) published 2007 by Addison-Wesley, which is also available [http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch14.html online].

This chapter returns to the Rose Terrace Nursing Home. The date is December 22, 1985, one week since Evelyn's last visit. She is again in the lounge. Mrs. Ninny Threadgoode is sitting in the same spot wearing the same dress. Evelyn is again eating candy and Ninny continues the conversation started the week before.

Ninny tells Evelyn about Idgie and her brother Buddy. Her name was Imogene, but Buddy gave her the name Idgie. Buddy was very popular with the girls and Idgie would carry love notes back and forth to his girlfriends. Buddy and Idgie stole watermelons once and hid them in their mother's blackberry patch. Mother thought they had grown there overnight and even looked for more the following year.

The family was large and close. Their mother was Baptist and their father Methodist, but everyone met back at the house for Sunday dinner.

The next article in The Weems Weekly is dated July 12, 1930 with the headline &quot;Whistle Stop Growing by Leaps and Bounds.&quot; Opal Threadgoode is opening a salon because her husband won't let her cut hair at home anymore because it is causing his hens not to lay eggs. Dot Weems points out that residents will now be able to get their hair done, mail a letter and eat all on the same block. She tells her readers the Glass Family reunion was held and the food tasted better than it looked. Dot tells her readers she has been busy taking care of her husband because he hooked his finger while fishing.

== Analysis ==

The nature of life in the town of Whistle Stop is again seen in this article. The small size of the town is seen in Dot's statement about the opening of the salon.

This chapter is set in the Whistle Stop Cafe on November 18, 1931. The name of the cafe is on boxcars around the country. The fires from hobo camps are everywhere and Idgie and Ruth have fed most of them at some point. Cleo is worried because she is feeding so many that she will go out of business or not have enough food left for herself and Ruth. Idgie tells Ninny she had an uncle that worked in a mint and was crushed by either 700 pounds of dimes or 300 pounds of quarters. When Ninny believes the story, Cleo tells her she should know better than to believe his crazy sister.

== Analysis ==

Idgie's generosity is seen again in this chapter. She can't turn away a hungry person. She isn't worried about money and cares more about people than making a profit.

This chapter returns to the Rose Terrace Nursing home on January 11, 1986. Evelyn is again in the lounge with Ninny; she is eating snowballs this time and gives one to Ninny. Ninny is talking about life with the Threadgoode's. On the fourth of July, they would wear paper crowns and eat ice cream. Their father would hire people to set off fireworks for the children. Buddy had come down dressed as Leona, who was the vainest of all the Threadgoode girls. Idgie wore overalls and Buddy had cut off all her hair, so she looked like a boy.

The cake Evelyn had shared reminded Ninny of the picnic where something awful had happened. The boys had walked some church friends to the train. The family heard a screeching sound. Buddy had been showing off for a girl and was killed.

An article in The Weems Weekly dated December 1, 1931. The headline reads &quot;Radio Star in Whistle Stop&quot; Essie Rue Limeway, a member of the Baptist choir and a barbershop quartet would be appearing on the radio at 6:30 every morning on the King Biscuit Time. She would be playing the piano in a commercial. Essie told Dot that they were overstocked with pianos and organs. Mentioning Essie's name would get the reader a discount. The only other news is from the new hair salon. The O in Opal fell off and almost hit Mrs. Otis. Opal wants all to know she now has human hair available.

== Analysis ==

Essie Rue is Idgie's sister. The Threadgoode family remains the center of interest in Whistle Stop. The cafe and salon are owned by Threadgoodes and one or two members of the family are mentioned in every edition of the paper up to this.

This chapter takes place on January 5, 1986 in the home of Evelyn and Ed Couch. Evelyn is locked in her sewing room eating her second pint of ice cream because Ed comments when she eats fattening foods. Ed is watching football. Evelyn is thinking about her life. She is 48 years old and feels lost. She feels like life has gone on without her; she doesn't get most jokes and is shocked by profane language. She believed Ed when he told her that the Vietnam War was good and that if she raised her son to be sensitive he would turn out gay. Her children had passed her by. At fifteen, her daughter had more sex than she had. Evelyn doesn't like sex. Her daughter told her it was stupid not to have sex with anyone but her husband because she doesn't even know if he is good.

An article in The Weems Weekly dated November 2, 1932. The article is entitled, &quot;Whistle Stop Pig Club Started.&quot; People interested in the club are advised to contact Bertha Vick. It is a mark of distinction to own a pig. In other new, Idgie has a new radio at the cafe and invites anyone who wants to listen to the cafe. They can listen without ordering food. The article ends with Dot Weems requesting advice on how to get dog tracks out of cement.

== Analysis ==

Idgie's generosity is seen again in this article. She allows people to come listen to their favorite radio show without ordering food. Life in a small town is seen in both the pig club and Dot asking for advice on getting her dog's tracks out of the cement.

This chapter takes place in the Rose Terrace Nursing Home on January 12, 1986

Evelyn is sharing a pimento and cheese sandwich with Ninny. Ninny is telling Evelyn about Sipsey, the black woman that worked for her family and later for Idgie in the cafe. Sipsey's mother had been a slave and Sipsey was very superstitious. She is afraid of the heads of animals and would bury the heads in the garden before cooking so their spirits couldn't enter her head and drive her crazy. Sipsey had always wanted a baby and one day a friend had come to the house to tell Sipsey that a woman was at the train station giving away a baby. The mother couldn't take the baby home because her husband had been in jail for three years. The baby was named George Pullman Peavy, after the train car.

This chapter takes place at the Whistle Stop Cafe on March 22, 1933. Idgie is having coffee with Smokey when a black man named Ocie Smith knocks on the door. He tells Idgie he has smelled the barbecue for months and has money to pay for some. She serves him out the back door and tells him she'd let him come in and sit down, but she can't. Idgie tells him to come whenever he wants and tells Sipsey to wait on him. Sipsey warns her she will get in trouble with the KKK.

Three days later, the sheriff comes to warn Idgie about serving black people. She responds by telling him he shouldn't be having an affair. The discussion gets heated when Idgie tells him he should change his shoes when he puts on his KKK robe.

The April 6, 1933 edition of The Weems Weekly talks about the menu at the cafe for April fool's Day. Idgie hung a menu offering items like Filet of Possum and Prime Rib of Pole Cat. She opened the door and yelled April fool at her customers. She gave a couple from Gate City a free dessert when she caught them reading the menu and leaving. Dot ends the article by telling her readers that she broke her toe when her husband let the dog in the house. She can't get out to find the news, so she asks her readers to bring the news to her at the post office.

== Analysis ==

In small towns, the post office is often where people meet to gossip. It makes sense that Dot can find her news right there where she works, because most of her news is actually gossip.

Evelyn and Ed are getting ready to go to visit his mother. Evelyn hates going to the nursing home. It reminds her of her mother's death from cancer eight years ago. She goes because Ed is sensitive about his mother. She has an overwhelming fear of dying and reads the obituaries every day to see the ages of the people who have passed away. Her fear of doctors turned to hatred after her mother's death. The doctor had come into the room and coldly told Evelyn and her mother that her mother's lung cancer had spread to several other organs. Evelyn hadn't even told her mother she had cancer. She still remembers the look of terror on her mother's face. Two days later, her mother had gone into a coma and was disconnected from life support.

An article in The Weems Weekly dated May 16, 1934 carries the headline, &quot;Gopher Bit Report.&quot; Bertha Vick was bitten on the bottom while sitting on her toilet in the middle of the night. Her husband thought she was dreaming until he saw the animal swimming in the toilet. Dot Weems tells her readers her husband thinks the gopher came up the pipes due to flooding from recent heavy rains. Dot asks her readers if anyone else has had a high electric bill. She attributes her high bill to her husband leaving the lights on all the time. Essie Rue has a job playing the organ in Birmingham for the Protective Life Insurance Company Radio Show.

== Analysis ==

The paper continues to portray life in the small town of Whistle Stop, Alabama. Again, Dot talks about her personal life in the paper, with her husband leaving the lights on and causing a...

This chapter takes the reader back to the Rose Terrace Nursing Home on January 19, 1986. Mrs. Ninny Threadgoode thinks Evelyn hasn't come to the nursing home, so she leaves the lounge to take a walk through the halls. She finds Evelyn eating candy and crying. Evelyn tells Ninny her kids are gone and she feels stuck between youth and old age. She is contemplating suicide. Ninny tells her suicide is like sticking a sword in the side of Jesus. She tells Evelyn her problem is menopause and she needs hormones and a walk in the sunshine every day. She tells Evelyn about a girl she knew who experienced early menopause at age thirty-six. This girl drove up to the courthouse and threw her mother's head at a state trooper. Ninny warns Evelyn that is what menopause can do if you're not careful.

An article in The Weems Weekly dated June 8, 1935. The headline reads, &quot;Drama Club Has Hit.&quot; The play, &quot;Hamlet&quot; was written by Shakespeare. This author, Dot notes, is the same man who wrote the play performed last year. The cast includes Earl Adcock, Jr. as Hamlet and his mother Vesta as Hamlet's mother. Essie Rue Limeway will play the organ in the show. Dot notes that Vesta is planning to write next year's play, which will be based on the history of Whistle Stop. She asks anyone who knows of any history to please send it to Vesta.

== Analysis ==

The tone of the article suggests that most Whistle Stop residents are not familiar with the works of William Shakespeare. Dot doesn't even seem to know who he is, either. It is written as though he were a contemporary playwright.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Chapter 54}}

On April 28, 1926, Idgie visits Ruth. She asks Ruth's mother to tell her that it is the bee charmer from Alabama. When Ruth comes down she asks Idgie what she is doing here &amp; Idgie tells her that she has been coming by every month for the two and a half years since Ruth left. Idgie tells Ruth she doesn't hate her and never did. She still loves Ruth and is now grown, so she won't be changing her mind. Idgie then gets in her car and leaves. When Frank asks Ruth who she is, Ruth says she is just someone Ruth used to know.

== Analysis ==
The theme of love is seen again in this chapter. Idgie has been driving to Georgia monthly to check on Ruth since her marriage to Frank. She loves Ruth and wants to make sure she is happy and safe. She doesn't intend on seeing Ruth, but finds herself at the door. Ruth feels the same; she has thought of Idgie every day since they parted. Frank chose Ruth because he thought she was untouched. Little does he know that Ruth has fallen in love with another person &amp; that love is as stronger then ever.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, my name is Angel. People can find me mostly helping on SwiftIRC's network, irc.swiftirc.net, in #RSHelp. Helping RS users with their questions and helping those on access with moderation of the users. I've come and finally registered here to help with some minor edits, help clean up the vandalism, and give some suggestions. I also have a user page on Runescape Wikia as User:RSHelp.

Fastest way to contact me is on freenode. I'm in a number of wikipedia and wikia irc channels with the username RSHelp. You can mention '''RSHelp''' in the channels as it will highlight me and if I'm not too busy I will respond shortly. You can also check my away status on freenode by typing /whois RSHelp. If it does not say my away is on then I'm somewhere nearby.

If there are other wiki's that may need some help, please let me know.

Thanks,

Angel

==Preparatory High School and College Courses==
Many high school and college courses are needed to prepare for an engineering education.

===Precollege Courses===
If a student wants to consider the possibility of pursuing a college degree in engineering, what types of K-12 courses should he/she take? Before even entering high school, students should investigate the admittance requirements of the universities for a student’s high school education. Universities set guidelines of prerequisite requirements upon applying. Most require a minimum of four years of high school mathematics, including at least the basic math courses (algebra one and two, geometry, trigonometry, and analytical geometry), and a minimum of four years of science, again covering at least the basic courses (chemistry, biology, and physics). Also, along with these set requirements for course work, most reputable engineering programs require submitting a placement exam (such as ACT or SAT) scores
and show no deficiencies in either math or science.

===College Courses===
Once admitted into a college engineering program students will be required to complete a year of college math and physics (about 10 courses). This would include fundamental science courses (Chemistry, Biology, Physics) and basic math courses (Calculus I, II, III and Differential Equations). These are usually the minimum level required for engineers in general, but specific engineering disciplines may require more. Most programs also require about a semester (5 courses) of &quot;engineering science courses&quot; where the understandings of math and science are directed toward broad applied science and math courses. They might
include courses such as Circuits, Statics, Dynamics, Fluids, Materials, Thermodynamics, and Statistics. The connections of math and science to engineering in these applied courses are quite obvious, for example, with the chemistry and differential equations used in Engineering Thermodynamics.

==Science and Mathematics Courses Connected to Engineering==
Basic math and science provide the tools of mathematical techniques and science phenomena that engineers use to address design problems related to phenomena of the natural world. They build on similar math and science foundational courses in high school that are introductory with a lower level of math that describe natural phenomena. The college level math and science courses provide a base for advanced math and science courses necessary to address more complex problems in a given engineering discipline. The basic math and science courses have also been utilized for a broad range of practical engineering applications
to develop courses that are referred to as engineering science courses such as Thermodynamics, Circuits, and Fluids. For example, the Engineering Science course of Fluids is typically taken by Chemical, Mechanical, Aerospace, and Biomedical Engineering students. That is because the general principles of Fluids apply to fluid flow of air for airplanes as well as flow of gases in internal combustion engines while fluid flow of liquid is used to analyze blood flow in humans as well as flow of chemicals in chemical processing plants. Thus, the connection of basic math and science to engineering is shown directly and unambiguously both as a base for advanced courses as well as being integrated into broadly subscribed Engineering Science courses. Brief descriptions of the basic math and science courses are presented here followed by short descriptions of the most widely subscribed Engineering Science courses.

'''Physics'''. Physics is the science of matter and the interaction of matter. It describes and predicts phenomena about matter, movement and forces, space and time, and other features of the natural world.

'''Chemistry'''. Chemistry is the science of the phenomena about composition, structure, and properties of matter, as well as the changes it undergoes during chemical reactions, especially as related to various atoms, molecules, crystals, and other aggregates of matter.

'''Biology''' and '''Biological Sciences'''. Biology is the science of living organisms that describes and predicts phenomena related to the structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, and distribution of living things as well as the interactions they have with each other and with the natural environment.

'''Calculus'''. Calculus is the mathematics of change which includes the study of limits, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series; many disciplines in engineering address problems that must be solved by differential calculus and integral calculus.

'''Differential Equations'''. Differential equations are equations with variables that relate the values of the function itself to its derivatives of various orders. Differential equations are used for engineering applications where changing quantities modeled by functions and their rates of change expressed as derivatives are known or postulated giving solutions that are dependent on boundary conditions.

==Engineering Courses Connected to Science and Mathematics==
As discussed previously, the basic math and science courses have been utilized for a broad range of practical engineering applications to develop courses that are referred to as engineering science courses such as Thermodynamics, Circuits, and Fluids. For example, the Engineering Science course of Fluids is typically taken by Chemical, Mechanical, Aerospace, and Biomedical Engineering students. That is because the general principles of Fluids apply to fluid flow of air for airplanes as well as flow of gases in internal combustion engines while fluid flow of liquid is used to analyze blood flow in humans as well as flow of chemicals in chemical processing plants. Thus, the connection of basic math and science to engineering is shown directly and unambiguously both as a base for advanced courses as well as being
integrated into broadly subscribed Engineering Science courses. Brief descriptions of the basic math and science courses are presented here followed by short descriptions of the most widely subscribed Engineering Science courses. Similar arguments apply to other engineering science courses that are also broadly subscribed by many disciplines. The courses will be briefly described in this section.

'''Dynamics'''. The field of dynamics uses the knowledge of classical mechanics that is concerned with effects of forces on motion of objects. Engineers use the concepts in design of any moving parts, such as for engines, machinery and motors. For example, a mechanical engineer would have used Dynamics extensively in the design of the pneumatically powered, multirow seed planter that was invented in 1956.

'''Electric Circuits'''. The field of circuits applies physics of electrical phenomena to the design, analysis, and simulation of linear electric circuits and measurements of their properties. The principles are used in circuit designs for wide ranging applications such as motors, cell phones, and computers. For example, an electrical engineer would have used Circuits extensively in the design in 1980 of the first circuit board with built-in self-testing technology.

'''Fluids'''. The subject of fluid mechanics uses physics of fluids to understand and predict the behavior of gases and liquids at rest and in motion which are referred to as fluid statics and fluid dynamics. As described previously, there are a broad set of engineering applications including air flow for airplanes and in internal combustion engines as well as fluid flow of liquid blood in humans as well as flow of chemicals in chemical processing plants. For example, a chemical engineer would have used the subject of Fluids extensively in the design of deep-draft pumping of oil from a depth of 4800 feet in the Gulf of Mexico begun in 2000.

'''Materials Science and Engineering'''. This subject utilizes the synthesis techniques of chemistry and the characterization tools of physics, such as the atomic force microscope, to control and characterize the properties of the structure and properties of solid materials. The principles of materials science are broadly used by a variety of engineering disciplines including electronics, aerospace, telecommunications, information processing, nuclear power, and energy conversion. Applications vary from structural steels to computer microchips. A materials engineer would have applied the principles of Materials Science extensively in the design of synthetic skin which can act as a framework for live cells that grow into a layer of skin while the framework is absorbed by the body.

'''Mechanics of Solids'''. This subject uses concepts and knowledge of continuum mechanics emerging from physics and mathematics to understand and predict the behavior of solid matter under external actions, such as external forces, temperature changes, and displacement or strain. The principles are broadly used on a variety of topics for a number of engineering disciplines. It is part of a broader study known as continuum mechanics. Engineers use the principles to determine what happens when a stress is applied to a component. Concepts are useful anytime that a component departs away from the rest shape due to stress. The amount of departure from rest, which is initially elastic or proportional to stress, is safe as long as the material is below its yield strength. For example, an aerospace engineer would have used Mechanics of Solids extensively in the design of the Space Shuttle first launched on April 12, 1981.

'''Statics'''. This is the engineering application of a branch of physics called Mechanics. It describes bodies which are acted upon by balanced forces and torques so that they remain at rest or in uniform motion. In statics, the bodies being studied are in equilibrium. The equilibrium conditions are very similar in the planar, or two-dimensional, and the three-dimensional rigid body statics. These are that the vector sum of all forces acting upon the body must be zero; and the resultant of all torques about any point must be zero. Thus it is necessary to understand the vector sums of forces and torques. For example, a civil engineer would have used Statics extensively in the design of the Golden Gate Bridge in 1937.

'''Engineering Thermodynamics'''. This subject uses the concepts of science that deal with transfer of heat and work which are used to solve engineering problems. Engineers use thermodynamics to calculate energies in chemical processing, to calculate the fuel efficiency of engines, and to find ways to make more efficient systems, be they rockets, refineries, or nuclear reactors. For example, a mechanical engineer would have used &quot;thermo&quot; extensively in the design of an &quot;alternative energy vehicle&quot; that uses natural gas.

'''Agricultural engineering''' involves the design of agricultural machinery and equipment, the development of ways to conserve water and improve the processing of agricultural foods, and the development of ways in which to conserve soil and water. None of this would be possible without an understanding of geology, chemistry, and biology.

'''Aerospace engineers''' use their knowledge of physics, math, and engineering to design and build airborne and space structures and the systems that support them. These include airplanes, helicopters, rockets, satellites, and the space shuttle. Examples of new human-related challenges are in designing safer and more comfortable commercial aircraft and in designing private airplanes for the elderly and physically challenged. Aerospace engineers typically work for organizations such as Lear, Boeing, and NASA.

'''Bioengineers''' design and develop devices and procedures that solve medical and health-related problems by combining a knowledge of physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine with engineering principles. They develop and evaluate systems and products such as artificial organs, prostheses, instruments, medical information systems, and health management and care delivery systems. They work with doctors and health care specialists to design and build components and systems that aid and improve the physical well being of humans. These include diagnostic devices (e.g. blood sugar sensors for diabetics) and body repair or replacement parts such as artificial hips or prosthetic legs. Examples of new challenges include developing organ replacements and sensors to monitor body chemistry. Bioengineers typically work for companies such as Medtronic, Baxter Healthcare, and Johnson and Johnson.

'''Chemical engineers''' apply the principles of chemistry to solve design and supervise facilities for the production and use of chemicals and biochemicals. They must be aware of all aspects of chemicals manufacturing and how the manufacturing process affects the environment and the safety of the workers and consumers. Examples include desalinization plants and semiconductor processing equipment. Examples of new human-related challenges are in designing and building equipment for large-scale production of artificial skin and bacteria-created antibiotics. They typically work for organizations such as Dow, DuPont, Motorola, and Monsanto.

'''Civil engineers''' design and supervise construction of structures and infrastructure such as roads, buildings, bridges, and water supply and sewage systems. Examples of new human-related challenges are in providing ready access and easy mobility for the elderly and physically challenged to all structures as well as infrastructure improvements for controlling and reducing urban environmental pollution of water and air. Civil engineers typically work as consultants and for architectural and city organizations such as Del Webb Houses and the City of Phoenix. They make use of mechanics from physics in the design of roads and structures, but also need the tools of chemistry and biology when addressing environmental issues related to water supply and sewage.

'''Computer scientists and engineers''' design computers and the instruction sets in computer programs that control systems and devices in the world around us. Examples are automobile engine controls or Internet information delivery. Examples of new human-related challenges are in developing programs that help physically challenged for controlling the motion of artificial limbs or for driving a car. Computer engineers work for companies such as Microsoft, Apple, and Hewlett Packard.

'''Electrical engineers''' design and fabricate electrical and electronic devices and systems. Examples include cell phones, televisions and skyscraper electrical delivery systems. Examples of new human-related challenges are in developing the sensors and electronics for bionic systems such as artificial eyes and ears. Electrical engineers typically work for organizations such as AT&amp;T, Motorola, Intel, and Medtronic.

'''Industrial engineers''' design and implement the most cost-effective organization of resources (people, information, energy, materials, and machines) for manufacturing and distributing engineering services and goods. Examples of new human-related challenges are improving safety and ergonomic design of cars for average or physically challenged individuals. Industrial engineers typically work for a variety of manufacturing organizations such as Intel, Boeing, and Honeywell.

'''Materials engineers''' design, select and improve the materials used in a wide array of engineering applications. These include the alloys in jet engines, plastics in bicycles, ceramics in radar equipment, composites in golf clubs, and semiconductors in cell phones. Examples of human-related challenges are new and improved materials for leg, arm or hand prosthetics and implants for hips and other joints. Materials engineers typically work for a variety of organizations such as Motorola, Boeing, and Ford.

'''Mechanical engineers''' use physics principles of motion, energy and force as a basis for understanding, analyzing, designing, and building mechanical components and systems. Such systems could include bicycles, cars, engines, and solar energy systems. New human-related challenges could include robotically controlled artificial limbs and mechanical components for an artificial heart. Mechanical engineers often work for organizations such as Boeing, Intel, and Honeywell.

'''Nuclear engineers''' design and build the processes, instruments, and systems that include radioactive materials. They might design nuclear power plants to generate electricity or to power ships and submarines. They also might design medical devices and systems that use trace amounts of radioactive material for diagnostic imaging and radiation treatment. This field makes extensive use of chemistry, biology, and physics in designing for such applications.

There are a lot of technologies and acronyms around OpenGL.
Here's how they are organized, and where to make choices.

(The technologies presented here may rely on any lower-lever ones, not just the one right to the left.)

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center; width: 600px;&quot;
|+ Low-level -&gt; High-level
|-
| rowspan=&quot;3&quot; | Graphic card
| OpenGL || WGL (for Windows) || EGL || GLEW || GLUT || SFML Graphics, ClanLib... (2D)
|-
| OpenGL ES || GLX (for X11) || EAGL (iOS) || Glee || GLFW || Irrlicht, OGRE, Unity, (3D)
|-
| WebGL || CGL/AGL (for OS X) || || || SDL, SFML || OpenSG, OpenScenegraph...
|-
| colspan=&quot;5&quot; |
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Your main choice here :)
|}

* The base technology is OpenGL.  OpenGL ES is a restricted set of OpenGL aimed at embedded platforms (smartphones...). OpenGL ES 2.0 in particular is based on OpenGL 2.0 but do not include at all the deprecated OpenGL 1.x features. GLSL (Shading Language) is a programming language for OpenGL &gt;=2.0 and executed on the GPU.  WebGL is based on OpenGL 2.0 and available in 2011 web browsers through JavaScript.
* On top of it, you have a system-dependent OpenGL implementation (WGL, GLX, etc.). It provides the standard glXxx functions and a way to integrate OpenGL in the OS display.
* EGL should provide a single interface to embedded systems' OpenGL ES implementations, for instance Android's.  EGL still requires platform-specific code, and only deals with low-level graphic context and texture setup.  Apple's iPhone uses a modified/extended version called EAGL.  You can work at this level, but usually parts of your program will be specific to one platform and not portable.
{{Wikipedia|OpenGL#Associated_utility_libraries}}
* GLEW and GLee provide some help with calling the OpenGL base functions and extensions in C; you can choose either one, as they imply almost no change to your code, or even neither and use &lt;code&gt;#define GL_GLEXT_PROTOTYPES&lt;/code&gt; for basic uses.
* GLUT, as well as GLFW, SDL and SFML, provide a truly platform-independant wrapper to start the OpenGL screen (exactly the same C code). Usually they also come with support for keyboard, joystick, and possibly other features.  You can choose a technology at this level when you do portable, direct OpenGL programming, or to target a specific version of OpenGL.  These technologies tend to rely on full OpenGL, but support for OpenGL ES and EGL is coming.  '''This book uses this layer!'''
* Libraries can be based on OpenGL to provide to higher-level features, such as game 2D sprite management (SFML Graphics, ClanLib...), or complete 3D engines (Irrlicht, Ogre...). They may completely shield the user from OpenGL, or only hide the nitty-gritty details (e.g. only give access to GLSL). We can distinguish render engines, scenegraphs, and more abstract game engines. Your choice will depend on what kind of application you are working on (2D, 3D, scene, game...).

Comparison between GLEW and GLee (as of 2011-09):
* GLee supports 3.0 while GLEW supports 4.2
* GLee does not require any initialization while GLEW does (&lt;code&gt;glewInit()&lt;/code&gt;)
* GLee does not ship mingw-compatible binary release (only VC++-compatible), and neither does GLEW
* GLee does not cross-compile (AFAICS) while GLEW does (cf. [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Installation/Windows|Windows setup]])

Other technologies:
* DirectX/Direct3D, from Microsoft, is the main competitor to OpenGL.  It covers most of the layers we saw above, up to (and including) the GLUT/GLFW one. Unlike OpenGL, it only runs on the Windows platform and is a proprietary technology.{{Wikipedia|Comparison_of_OpenGL_and_Direct3D}}
* OpenCL is for executing generic (non-graphic) code on the graphic card GPU, for parallel programming.  CUDA is a proprietary nVidia-specific alternative.
* Mesa3D provides implementation for several technologies, for instance EGL, OpenGL, OpenGL ES, as well as a software implementation of OpenGL that works without a 3D card, so it spans several base layers. It also allows using OpenGL ES from GNU/Linux (X11) desktops.

= Hardware support =

{{Wikipedia|Comparison_of_Android_devices}}
{{Wikipedia|List_of_PowerVR_products}}
Mobile / smartphones:
* OpenGL ES 1.1 is supported in most smartphones. Only a few early (2009) or low-end models, such as HTC G1/Dream/Hero/Magic (Qualcomm MSM72XX GPU) do not support 3D acceleration. It's supported in all iPhones and iPod Touches (PowerVR MBX GPUs and SGX GPUs).
* OpenGL ES 2.x is supported in most smartphones released after mid-2010, except low-end ones. This includes iPhone 3G'''S''', iPod Touch 3rd generation (PowerVR SGX535 GPU), Samsung Galaxy S (PowerVR SGX540 GPU), HTC Legend, Samsung Galaxy Ace (Qualcomm MSM7227 GPU), Nexus One (Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset / Adreno &gt;= 200 GPU)...
* Screen size (in pixels) may vary a lot, from 240x320 to 640x960.
* Android has [http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/opengl.html statistics] on OpenGL 2.0 deployment.

Desktops:
* OpenGL 2.x is available since 2002/2003. Current graphic cards support OpenGL 3.x or 4.x.
* Free (as in freedom) drivers for GNU/Linux support OpenGL 3.1 as of June 2013 (cf. Xorg wiki's [http://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature RadeonFeature]).
** Radeon r600 supports GLSL 1.3 with mesa-dri &gt;= 9.0, OpenGL 3.0 with also Linux kernel &gt;= 3.6 (tested), and apparently OpenGL 3.1 with also mesa-dri &gt;= 9.1 and xorg-xserver &gt;= 1.13 (to test)

==Who Is the Client or Customer for the Designed Artifact?==
There are many types of societal issues which extend beyond the borders of any single state or country that will impact the quality of many people's lives in the future. However, in order to address a given global issue, it has to be reconfigured into a local issue, whether it is at the city, county, state, region, or national level. Then local action can be taken to address a local problem, which then contributes to the solution of the global range of the problem. For example, for the issue of Drought in the Southwest, a way to address this as a local problem might be given by the question, &quot;How can water be conserved in the city of Phoenix?&quot; Thus, the design process for a product designated for the public good requires consideration of the scope of implementation. For example, will the designed artifact or process address an audience of one person or many people? Do they live locally on the block or in the town, or regionally in the county or state or contiguous states or possibly nationally or internationally one. These issues will be considered in the exercise below.

{{Robox|theme=8|title=Activity - Who is client or sponsor for a designed societal issue solution?}}
Select three or four topics from the list of global issues in the [[../Role_of_Science_and_Math_in_Engineering#What_Is_Mathematics.3F|second activity]] of the ''Role of Science and Mathematics in Engineering'' section that interest you. Describe and write down who the clients or customers might be for the three or four issues you selected.
{{Robox/Close}}

==A Streamlined Engineering Design Process==
The design process begins when a client or customer has a problem or need and wants a designed solution resulting in a product that meets the need or solves the problem. Sometimes, a new product is developed from scratch which would require a new design and sometimes innovations are used to improve existing products, in which case some aspects of an already existed design would be modified. New products generally use an open-ended process that rarely has a single correct solution. Instead, there are several solutions that will satisfy desired needs with varying degrees of effectiveness. In this section, we will indicate how each step of the design process is connected to math and science. One of the challenges of design is to choose from a number of possible solutions. However, a clearly defined process flow is needed so that designs are developed to meet the needs of customer or client. We will demonstrate how math and science connect to engineering in the engineering design process with a simplified example to facilitate understanding. The process is usually iterative but a single cycle will be used here since the goal is to show the math and science connection to engineering (Figure 6). Briefly stated, the streamlined steps in the design process might consist of the following:

* Identify a problem or a need.
* Define requirements and constraints.
* Generate ideas or brainstorm for set possible solutions.
* Use requirements and constraints to evaluate possible solutions.
* Use the chosen solution to design and build a prototype.
* Test and evaluate the prototype and modify if necessary to finalize prototype.
* Communicate the results.

[[File:Engineering design process.svg|400px|center|thumb|'''Figure 5.6''': A simplified engineering design process.]]

==Case Study—Water for a Small, Isolated Seaside Village in an Underdeveloped Country==
Let us say that there is a small village of 50 people living in a tropical climate at the desert's edge by the sea and named Ecologia. It is connected to the next small village 150 miles away by a poor one-lane road that is sometimes impassable due to dust storms and bad repair. The town lives by fishing from the ocean and by farming a small patch of vegetables, but does have a few gasoline-powered generators to supply some electricity to the village. It is located in the underdeveloped country of Optimicia which does not have the resources to supply utilities such as electricity, water, and communication to the town. A single well has supplied water to the town, but the water level is dropping and it may go dry. The village would like to have another means of supply of water to supplement the current supply and assure sufficient quantities for the future.

This scenario will be used with the goal being to demonstrate math and science connections to engineering in the design process. As such, detailed numbers and calculations are not used, so decisions and details will not be rigorous in order to simplify the example. We now go through the steps of the design process, pointing out the connections to science and math.

===Identify the Problem===
An isolated village next to the ocean with 50 lower income people has no connection to government supported utilities, the nearest town 150 miles away on a poor road, and the village's deep well water source that is being depleted. A new source of water is needed.

''Science connection''. A civil engineer might use an instrument to monitor the well water level to measure the rate of depletion of water.

''Math connection''. Mathematics could be used to develop a model for cost and availability of current water sources (wells, monsoons, and trucked in water).

===Define Requirements and Constraints===
Requirements might include the purity of the water, the rate at which water is produced, the lifetime required from a designed system, and the fact that, since the village is off the electrical distribution grid, no utilities are available to support the system. Constraints might include various cost limitations such as for design, fabrication, operation, and maintenance of the system, as well as possible safety
and environmental considerations. From the sets of requirements and constraints, as well as consideration of the context of the situation with the village, people, and environment, a problem statement could be developed and might read as follows: &quot;A system for producing drinkable water will be developed which will supply the needs of 50 people such that the cost is no greater than $2 per thousand gallons, including materials, construction, and operation over a period of 10 years&quot;.

''Science connection''. A knowledge of the science underlying the various existing techniques is necessary so that the widest range of approaches to providing water is explored.

''Math connection''. Mathematical models may be used here to examine water costs for different systems so that a reasonable set of requirements and constraints are used in generating the problem statement. There are mathematical models that describe costs for existing techniques, but new models would need to be created if a new technology was devised.

===Brainstorm Alternative Solutions===
At this stage of the process the widest variety of ideas and/or possible solutions needs to be explored for the design problem. These ideas can come from many different sources: existing products, brainstormed ideas, ideas from scientific principles, and any other approaches possible. The body of these possibilities, or design concepts, needs to then be shaped into a component, system or process that could fulfill the set of requirements and constraints as possible problem solutions. Some approaches may be thrown out early if they have little potential (e.g., supplying pure water from icebergs to a village near the equator is probably not feasible).

''Science connection''. A variety of solutions could be generated based on scientific principles as shown with the following examples. Sea water can be purified by freezing, but this is not a good approach for a village near the equator. Purifying sea water by distillation (evaporation and condensation) could be used in a solar still or in a flash evaporation plant. Purifying seawater by removing salt with a membrane could be done with a reverse osmosis plant. Moving pure water to the town by new wells, by truck or by pipeline are other possible solutions without much science.

''Math connection''. Mathematical models to roughly estimate costs for the various approaches could be generated in the first portion of this step of the design process. They are also used to predict a cost for various alternative solutions that arise during idea generation phase and can help analyze the linkage between the science behind a technique and the cost of implementing it with materials, fabrication or manufacturing, operation, and maintenance. These costs then need to be normalized for the sake of comparison with other options to cost per thousand gallons of water.

===Evaluate Solutions===
Potential designs are evaluated relative to the constraints and criteria, and one or more are selected to be designed in detail and prototyped. The selection is made using a structured process that requires the requirements be met and chooses the best design according to the requirements and constraints. To continue to show math and science connections it will be assumed that the best design was a solar still for desalination. Using that choice other design steps will now be considered.

===Design and Build Prototype===
The selected design is developed in full detail and components' specific shapes and dimensions determined. Materials are selected and components are fabricated and prototype assembled. Prototype operation and performance may be modeled on a computer. For the hypothetical design a prototype solar still is built.

''Science connection''. A more detailed knowledge of the science can be created with more accurate values of physical parameters which will also provide information that may affect various costs for the components of the prototype. The nature of the physical phenomena that are occurring within various components should be modeled from the viewpoint of the science-based ideal so that performance can be evaluated when the prototype is tested.

''Math connection''. Mathematical models of performance based on science phenomena will be generated to evaluate the prototype.

===Test and Evaluate Prototype===
Prototypes are tested to see if the design meets all requirements and performs acceptably. The performance should be compared to the ideal performance determined from mathematical modeling of the prototype. Differences between the ideal and real performance should be analyzed and understood. The design process may be iterated and refined to improve performance until it is acceptable. Sometimes, testing and evaluation show that a design will not work, so that a different design concept must be selected by returning to evaluate alternative solutions. If the hypothetical solar still meets performance specifications and fulfills constraints then the solution can be communicated.

''Science connection''. The scientific model of operation should approximate the actual prototype performance; if not, then there may be science phenomena not correctly implemented in the model or there may be other issues in construction or operation that needs to be diagnosed to have a model that is a good predictor of performance.

''Math connection''. The mathematical model of operation should be tested to make certain that the model has been constructed properly using the appropriate science and mathematics.

===Communicate Results===
The activities and results of the design process should be documented and communicated to the appropriate client or customer.

''Science connection''. All steps of the design process should be documented and justification for decisions should be made clear. The science behind the choice of the solution to the design problem should be made clear, including factors and weights of requirements and constraints used to select the solution.

''Math connection''. The mathematical model of operation should be well documented so that a basis for performance and effectiveness of the design is demonstrated. The model should also be documented so that the effectiveness of the design in fulfilling the client's needs is demonstrated.

{{Robox|theme=8|title=Activity - Connecting Math and Science to the Engineering Design Process in Addressing a Global Societal Issue or Problem}}

----
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
In the '''Inventory''' tab at the left, select '''collabn1''' (the virtual machine we just created).
[[File:RA-vmweb-collabn1-only.png|none|border|400px]]

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
From the '''Commands''' box, click '''Add Hardware'''.  In the window that appears, click '''CD/DVD Drive'''.
[[File:RA-vmweb-addhardware.png|none|border|550px]]

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
Choose to '''Use an ISO Image'''.
[[File:RA-vmweb-addhardware-dvd.png|none|border|550px]]

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
Click '''Browse''' and locate the file '''[RAC11g-iso] Enterprise-R5-U6-Server-i386-dvd.iso'''.
[[File:RA-vmweb-addhardware-dvd-browse.png|none|border|550px]]

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
Open the section called '''Virtual Device Node''' and choose '''IDE 0:0'''. Then click '''Next'''.
{{Warning|'''Carefully follow this step''' because it's easy to miss.}}
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:RA-vmweb-addhardware-dvd-prop.png|none|border|550px]]

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
Click '''Finish''' to add the device.  Don't power on the virtual machine yet.
[[File:RA-vmweb-addhardware-summary.png|none|border|550px]]

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
'''If you are in a class''', then the instructor may have provided a second virtual DVD named '''RAC11gR2.iso''' to save some class time.  It contains all additional software downloads.  
* '''Repeat all previous steps''' from this lab to add the second DVD using RAC11gR2.iso image and choosing '''IDE 0:1'''.
'''If you are not in a class''', then you will later download all needed software and build the second DVD yourself.  
* '''Continue below.'''

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
Scroll down to the Hardware box and confirm the Virtual Machine settings.  They should match this picture (except that you should only see the second DVD if you are in a class and it was provided by the instructor):

      <comment>/* Landscape */ EGL in theory and practice</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Landscape==
The way I see it is:  

window/context management: OpenGL -&gt; WGL, GLX, CGL/AGL -&gt; GLUT, GLFW, freeglut  

extensions: OpenGL -&gt; GLEW, Glee

and on top of those two branches, there are render engines (e.g. OGRE) and scenegraphs (e.g. OpenSG, OpenScenegraph). And on top of render engines and scenegraphs, there are game engines etc. (e.g. OgreKit; however, many game engines implement their own render engine; thus, this distinction isn't always useful).

OpenCL is next to OpenGL but doesn't have many libraries on top of it.

Then there is:

OpenGL ES (and OpenVG) -&gt; EAGL -&gt; EGL -&gt; render engines -&gt; game engines

Where EAGL would correspond to the level of WGL, GLX, CGL/AGL, and EGL would correspond to the level of GLUT , GLFW, freeglut

WebGL is very close to OpenGL ES but currently doesn't require an API such as EGL, instead it has HTML5 on top of it.

I guess, currently, the OpenGL ES branch is a separate branch from the OpenGL branch. In the road map of Khronos, however, the idea is to use EGL to communicate buffers between OpenGL, OpenCL, OpenGL ES and WebGL. A good illustration is slide 7 of the &quot;An Interactive OpenCL Overview&quot; presentation on [http://www.khronos.org/opencl/ this page].

I've never used Mesa3D. Apparently, it is difficult to integrate in such a scheme because you can use it in various ways.

Direct3D is probably an alternative up to (and including) the GLUT, GLFW, freeglut level.

I'm not sure EGL is currently used with OpenGL. The text says: &quot;EGL should provide a single interface to embedded systems' OpenGL implementation, for instance Android.&quot; Does this refer to OpenGL ES or is it really OpenGL?

At least, that's how I understand the situation. :) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 20:59, 13 August 2011 (UTC)

: Thanks! I added several of your remarks in the document, and referenced Direct3D and Mesa3D in a separate section.
: I see EGL support in [http://wiki.glfw.org/wiki/Suggestions_and_ideas#EGL_wrapper_of_GLFW GLFW].  This layer is getting increasing support for mobile platforms, so I don't think separating OpenGL ES / EGL is appropriate.  I fixed &quot;OpenGL&quot; -&gt; &quot;OpenGL ES&quot; when discussing EGL though.
: EGL is not at the same level than GLUT&amp;cie: you need platform-specific code to initialize it, so (for instance) it is typically not a good candidate to work with in the tutorials.  I wanted to make this distinction because I hesitated myself. [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 10:50, 15 August 2011 (UTC)

::I've only programmed OpenGL ES 2.0 on iOS with EAGL (and the POWERVR SDK which uses EAGL on iOS); thus, I don't know. However, the &quot;OpenGL ES 2.0 Programming Guide&quot; states on page 35: &quot;As part of the family of APIs provided by the Khronos Group for developing content, a (mostly) platform-independent API, EGL, is available for managing ''drawing surfaces'' (windows are just one type; we'll talk about others later).&quot; And later on page 36: &quot;EGL provides a &quot;glue&quot; layer between OpenGL ES 2.0 (and other Khronos graphics APIs) and the native windowing system running on you computer, like the X WIndow System common on GNU/Linux systems, Microsoft Windows, or Mac OS X's Quartz.&quot; On the other hand, that book was written when the only implementation of OpenGL ES 2.0 was the AMD emulator; thus, it probably doesn't reflect current practice. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 11:53, 15 August 2011 (UTC)

== Title? ==

I'm not so sure about the title. Shouldn't it rather refer to &quot;APIs&quot; or graphics libraries? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 21:03, 13 August 2011 (UTC)
: Maybe &quot;APIs and libraries&quot;, yes indeed.[[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 10:50, 15 August 2011 (UTC)

== Hardware Support ==

The &quot;POWERVR Khronos OpenGL ES 2.0 SDKs&quot; [http://www.imgtec.com/powervr/insider/sdkdownloads/index.asp#GLES2] are also available for Linux and Windows Vista/XP, where the SDK offers an emulation of OpenGL ES 2.0 on desktops. 

Another OpenGL ES 2.0 emulator for Windows was developed by AMD; it is no longer supported but still available in the wiki for the OpenGL ES 2.0 Programming Guide [http://code.google.com/p/opengles-book-samples/wiki/Instructions].

And, in a way, Xcode includes an emulator of OpenGL ES (and iOS) on MacOS X.

:: Thanks again!  I moved and clarified the part of Mesa3D &quot;emulation&quot;.  Being a free software enthusiast, I don't feel like discussing (advertising) proprietary solutions at length, and I don't think I know enough to discuss these parts, so maybe I'll incorporate this later.</text>

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Click the '''Console''' tab.  You might see a message saying that the Remote Console Plug-in is not 
installed.  If you see this message then click '''Install plug-in''' and follow the directions before 
continuing.  (Note: you may be asked to restart your computer during this process.)
[[File:RA-vmweb-collabn1-only-console-notinstalled.png|none|border|550px]]

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
When the plugin is installed, you should see a large “play” button in the center of the console. Click 
on the play button to start the VM.
[[File:RA-vmweb-collabn1-only-console.png|none|border|550px]]

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
When you see the square boxes, click anywhere to open a console window.
[[File:RA-vmweb-console-only.png|none|border|550px]]

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
A new window will now open - outside of your web browser.  If you opened this window soon after starting the Virtual Machine, then you will see the boot screen of the Oracle Enterprise Linux installer.
[[File:RA-oel-install-bootdvd.png|none|border|550px]]

At first, this new console window will ignore your keyboard and mouse.  '''Click inside the new console window''' and it will begin accepting your keyboard and mouse.
{{Info|Anytime your keyboard and mouse are stuck in the VMware Virtual Machine, you can press '''CTRL and ALT together''' to move them outside the VM.}}

If you still see the boot screen then you may press enter to continue, or just wait for it to automatically continue.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;

[[File:RA-oel-install-tasks.png|none|border|550px]]

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Attributes: pass additional vertex information =

We may need more than just plain coordinates in our program. For instance: colors.
Let's pass RGB color information to OpenGL.

We passed the coordinates using an ''attribute'', so we can add a new attribute for colors.
Let's modify our globals:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
GLuint vbo_triangle, vbo_triangle_colors;
GLint attribute_coord2d, attribute_v_color;
&lt;/source&gt;

And our ''init_resources'':
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  GLfloat triangle_colors[] = {
    1.0, 1.0, 0.0,
    0.0, 0.0, 1.0,
    1.0, 0.0, 0.0,
  };
  glGenBuffers(1, &amp;vbo_triangle_colors);
  glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo_triangle_colors);
  glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(triangle_colors), triangle_colors, GL_STATIC_DRAW);

  [...]

  attribute_name = &quot;v_color&quot;;
  attribute_v_color = glGetAttribLocation(program, attribute_name);
  if (attribute_v_color == -1) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Could not bind attribute %s\n&quot;, attribute_name);
    return 0;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

Now in the &lt;code&gt;onDisplay&lt;/code&gt; procedure, we can pass 1 RGB color for each of our 3 vertices. I chose yellow, blue and red, but feel free to use your favorite colors :)
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  glEnableVertexAttribArray(attribute_v_color);
  glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo_triangle_colors);
  glVertexAttribPointer(
    attribute_v_color, // attribute
    3,                 // number of elements per vertex, here (r,g,b)
    GL_FLOAT,          // the type of each element
    GL_FALSE,          // take our values as-is
    0,                 // no extra data between each position
    0                  // offset of first element
  );
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's tell OpenGL once we're done with the attribute, at the end of the function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  glDisableVertexAttribArray(attribute_v_color);
&lt;/source&gt;

Last, we declare it also in our vertex shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
attribute vec3 v_color;
&lt;/source&gt;

At this point, if we run the program, we'll get:
 Could not bind attribute v_color

This is because we didn't use v_color yet.&lt;ref&gt;It's a bit confusing to have a single example across the two differents concepts of attribute and varying. We'll try to find two separate examples to better explain them.&lt;/ref&gt;

Problem is: we want to color in the fragment shader, not in the vertex shader!
Let's now see how to...

= Varyings: pass information from the vertex shader to the fragment shader =

Instead of using an attribute, we'll use a '''''varying''''' variable. It's:
* An ''output'' variable for the vertex shader
* An ''input'' variable for the fragment shader
* It's interpolated.
So it's a communication channel between the two shaders.  To understand why it's interpolated, let's see an example.

We need to declare our new varying, say &lt;code&gt;f_color&lt;/code&gt;, in both shaders.

 {{Yellow_Warning | '''A ''varying'' declaration needs to be identical in the vertex shader and in the fragment shader.}}

In triangle.v.glsl:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
attribute vec2 coord2d;
attribute vec3 v_color;
varying vec3 f_color;
void main(void) {
  gl_Position = vec4(coord2d, 0.0, 1.0);
  f_color = v_color;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

and in triangle.f.glsl:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
varying vec3 f_color;
void main(void) {
  gl_FragColor = vec4(f_color.x, f_color.y, f_color.z, 1.0);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

(Note: if you're using GLES2, check the section on portability below.)

Let's see the result:

[[File:OpenGL Tutorial Triangle no-fade version.png|thumb|Triangle]]

Wow, there's actually more than 3 colors!

OpenGL interpolates the vertex value for each pixel.
This explains the ''varying'' name: it varies for each vertex, and then it varies even more for each fragment.

We didn't need to declare the varying in the C code - that's because there's no interface between the C code and the varying.

= Interweaving coordinates and colors =

To better understand the ''glVertexAttribPointer'' function, let's mix both attributes in a single C array:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  GLfloat triangle_attributes[] = {
     0.0,  0.8,   1.0, 1.0, 0.0,
    -0.8, -0.8,   0.0, 0.0, 1.0,
     0.8, -0.8,   1.0, 0.0, 0.0,
  };
  glGenBuffers(1, &amp;vbo_triangle);
  glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo_triangle);
  glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(triangle_attributes), triangle_attributes, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;glVertexAttribPointer&lt;/code&gt;'s 5th element is the ''stride'', to tell OpenGL how long each set of attributes is - in our case 5 floats:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  glEnableVertexAttribArray(attribute_coord2d);
  glEnableVertexAttribArray(attribute_v_color);
  glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo_triangle);
  glVertexAttribPointer(
    attribute_coord2d,   // attribute
    2,                   // number of elements per vertex, here (x,y)
    GL_FLOAT,            // the type of each element
    GL_FALSE,            // take our values as-is
    5 * sizeof(GLfloat), // next coord2d appears every 5 floats
    0                    // offset of the first element
  );
  glVertexAttribPointer(
    attribute_v_color,      // attribute
    3,                      // number of elements per vertex, here (r,g,b)
    GL_FLOAT,               // the type of each element
    GL_FALSE,               // take our values as-is
    5 * sizeof(GLfloat),    // next color appears every 5 floats
    (GLvoid*) (2 * sizeof(GLfloat))  // offset of first element
  );
&lt;/source&gt;

It works just the same!

Note that for colors, we start at the 3rd element (&lt;code&gt;2 * sizeof(GLfloat)&lt;/code&gt;) of the array, where the first color is - that the ''offset'' of the first element.

Why &lt;code&gt;(GLvoid*)&lt;/code&gt;?  We saw that, in early versions of OpenGL, it was possible to pass a pointer to a C array directly (rather than a buffer object).  This is now deprecated, but the &lt;code&gt;glVertexAttribPointer&lt;/code&gt; prototype remained unchanged, so we do as if we passed a pointer, but we pass an offset really.

An alternative for sport:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
struct attributes {
    GLfloat coord2d[2];
    GLfloat v_color[3];
};
struct attributes triangle_attributes[] = {
    {{ 0.0,  0.8}, {1.0, 1.0, 0.0}},
    {{-0.8, -0.8}, {0.0, 0.0, 1.0}},
    {{ 0.8, -0.8}, {1.0, 0.0, 0.0}},
};
...
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(triangle_attributes), triangle_attributes, GL_STATIC_DRAW);

...

glVertexAttribPointer(
  ...,
  sizeof(struct attributes),  // stride
  (GLvoid*) offsetof(struct attributes, v_color)  // offset
  ...
&lt;/source&gt;

Note the use of &lt;code&gt;offsetof&lt;/code&gt; to specify the first color offset.

= Uniforms: pass global information =

The opposite of ''attribute'' variables are ''uniform'' variables : they are the same for all the vertices.
Note that we can change them on a regular basis from the C code - but each time a set of vertices is displayed on screen, the uniform will be constant.

Let's say that we want to define the triangle's global transparency from our C code. As with attributes, we need to declare it.
A global in the C code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
GLint uniform_fade;
&lt;/source&gt;
Then we declare it in the C code (still after the program linking):
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  const char* uniform_name;
  uniform_name = &quot;fade&quot;;
  uniform_fade = glGetUniformLocation(program, uniform_name);
  if (uniform_fade == -1) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Could not bind uniform %s\n&quot;, uniform_name);
    return 0;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

Note: we could even target a specific array element in the shader code with &lt;code&gt;uniform_name&lt;/code&gt;, e.g. &lt;code&gt;&quot;my_array[1]&quot;&lt;/code&gt;!

In addition, for uniform, we also explicitly set its non-varying value. Let's request, in &lt;code&gt;onDisplay&lt;/code&gt;, that the triangle be very little opaque:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
glUniform1f(uniform_fade, 0.1);
&lt;/source&gt;

We now can use this variable in our fragment shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
varying vec3 f_color;
uniform float fade;
void main(void) {
  gl_FragColor = vec4(f_color.x, f_color.y, f_color.z, fade);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note: if you don't use the uniform in your code, &lt;code&gt;glGetUniformLocation&lt;/code&gt; will not see it, and fail.

= OpenGL ES 2 portability =

In the previous section, we mentioned that GLES2 requires precision hints. These hints tells OpenGL how much precision we want for our data. The precision can be:
* &lt;code&gt;lowp&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;mediump&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;highp&lt;/code&gt;
For instance, &lt;code&gt;lowp&lt;/code&gt; can often be used for colors, and it's recommended to use &lt;code&gt;highp&lt;/code&gt; for vertices.

We can specify the precision on each variable:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
varying lowp vec3 f_color;
uniform lowp float fade;
&lt;/source&gt;

or, we can declare a default precision:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
precision lowp float;
varying vec3 f_color;
uniform float fade;
&lt;/source&gt;

Sadly these precision hints do not work on traditional OpenGL 2.1, so we need to include them only if we're on GLES2.

GLSL includes a preprocessor, similar to the C preprocessor.  We can use directive such as &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;#ifdef&lt;/code&gt;.

Only the fragment shader requires an explicit precision for floats. The precision is implicitely &lt;code&gt;highp&lt;/code&gt; for vertex shaders. For fragment shaders, &lt;code&gt;highp&lt;/code&gt; might not be available, which can be tested using the &lt;code&gt;GL_FRAGMENT_PRECISION_HIGH&lt;/code&gt; macro&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite web|url=http://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/specs/2.0/GLSL_ES_Specification_1.0.17.pdf |title=OpenGL ES Shading Language 1.0.17 Specification |publisher=Khronos.org |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2011-09-10}}, section 4.5.3 Default Precision Qualifiers&lt;/ref&gt;.

We already prepended a macro processing directive through our &lt;code&gt;create_shader&lt;/code&gt; utility function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
#define GLES2
&lt;/source&gt;

We can improve our shader loader so it defines a default precision on GLES2, and ignore precision identifiers on OpenGL 2.1 (so we can still set the precision for a specific variable if needed):
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  GLuint res = glCreateShader(type);
  const GLchar* sources[] = {
    // Define GLSL version
#ifdef GL_ES_VERSION_2_0
    &quot;#version 100\n&quot;
#else
    &quot;#version 120\n&quot;
#endif
    ,
    // GLES2 precision specifiers
#ifdef GL_ES_VERSION_2_0
    // Define default float precision for fragment shaders:
    (type == GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER) ?
    &quot;#ifdef GL_FRAGMENT_PRECISION_HIGH\n&quot;
    &quot;precision highp float;           \n&quot;
    &quot;#else                            \n&quot;
    &quot;precision mediump float;         \n&quot;
    &quot;#endif                           \n&quot;
    : &quot;&quot;
    // Note: OpenGL ES automatically defines this:
    // #define GL_ES
#else
    // Ignore GLES 2 precision specifiers:
    &quot;#define lowp   \n&quot;
    &quot;#define mediump\n&quot;
    &quot;#define highp  \n&quot;
#endif
    ,
    source };
  glShaderSource(res, 3, sources, NULL);
&lt;/source&gt;

Keep in mind that the GLSL compiler will count these prepended lines in its line count when displaying error messages.  Setting &lt;code&gt;#line 0&lt;/code&gt; sadly does not reset this compiler line count.

= Refreshing the display =

Now it would be quite nice if the transparency could vary back and forth.
To achieve this,
* we can check the number of seconds since the user started the application; &lt;code&gt;glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME)/1000&lt;/code&gt; gives that
* apply the maths ''sin'' function on it (the ''sin'' function goes back on forth between -1 and +1 every 2.PI=~6.28 units of time)
* ask the application to redisplay the triangle (with the new fade value); this is &lt;code&gt;glutPostRedisplay()&lt;/code&gt;
* GLUT has an &quot;idle&quot; function that is called whenever GLUT has nothing more to do (e.g. it finished displaying the triangle), we can put our code there

In ''main'', let's declare the &quot;idle&quot; function, after &lt;code&gt;glutDisplayFunc(...)&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
glutIdleFunc(idle);
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's add a new ''idle'' function
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void idle()
{
  float cur_fade = sinf(glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME) / 1000.0 * (2*M_PI) / 5) / 2 + 0.5; // 0-&gt;1-&gt;0 every 5 seconds
  glUseProgram(program);
  glUniform1f(uniform_fade, cur_fade);
  glutPostRedisplay();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Also remove the call to &lt;code&gt;glUniform1f&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;onDisplay&lt;/code&gt;.

Last, we need to declare our use of the C maths library:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
and in the Makefile:

[[File:OpenGL Tutorial Triangle alpha-blending.png|thumb|The animated triangle, partially transparent]]
We've got our first animation!

It is common that OpenGL implementation wait for the screen's vertical refresh before updating the physical screen's buffer - this is called vertical sync. In that case, the triangle will be rendered around 60 times per second (60 FPS). If you disable vertical sync, the program will keep updating the triangle continuously, resulting in a higher CPU usage.  We'll meet again the vertical sync when we create applications with perspective changes.

      <comment>/* Matrices setup */ math library should not plural</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In this tutorial we'll dive into the world of transformation matrices, so we can translate, rotate and scale our triangle.

= Matrices setup =

{{wikibooks|GLSL_Programming/Vertex_Transformations{{!}}section about Vertex Transformations in the GLSL Programming }}
Here are a few tidbits to remember when working with matrices:
* Transformations are applied by multiplying 4x4 matrices in the reverse order. &lt;code&gt;M = M_translation * M_rotation&lt;/code&gt; means rotate first, then translate.
* The identity matrix is the matrix that does nothing - no transformation at all.
* To transform a vertex, we multiply it by the matrix: &lt;code&gt;v' = M * v&lt;/code&gt;
* 4x4 matrices can be applied to 4x1 vectors only, which we obtain by using 1 in the 4th dimensions for vertices: (x, y, z, 1).

To do these multiplications, we'll need a math library. Shaders come with built-in, easy support for matrix operations, but usually we'll need to manipulate matrices from the C code. It's also more efficient, because shaders are executed for each vertex, so it's better to compute matrices beforehand.

This tutorial will use [http://glm.g-truc.net/ OpenGL Mathematics] (GLM) library, which is written in C++.  GLM tends to use the same conventions as GLSL, and so will be easier to start with. Its documentation also describes replacements for deprecated OpenGL 1.x and GLU functions, such as &lt;code&gt;glRotate&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;glFrustum&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;gluLookAt&lt;/code&gt;, which comes in handy if you already used them.

Alternatives exist, such as [http://simdx86.sourceforge.net/ libSIMDx86] (which also works on non-x86 processors, by the way).  You can also write your own matrix code, since it's not very long, see for example &lt;code&gt;mesa-demos-8.0.1/src/egl/opengles2/tri.c&lt;/code&gt; in the Mesa3D demos.

Note: since we use C++, we'll need to switch our program to C++ as well - sorry about that, we'll have to edit the first tutorials to do that from the start. Actually you just need to rename &lt;code&gt;triangle.c&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;triangle.cpp&lt;/code&gt;.

GLM is a header-only library, so you don't need to modify the Makefile, as long as the headers are installed in the standard path.
To install GLM under Debian and Ubuntu:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
apt-get install libglm-dev
&lt;/source&gt;

We now can add the GLM headers:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;glm/glm.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;glm/gtc/matrix_transform.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;glm/gtc/type_ptr.hpp&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

= Using 3D points =

Our transformation matrices are meant for 3D vertices.  Even if we're currently 2D, we'll describe our triangle as 3D points with Z=0.  We'll move to 3D objects in the next tutorial anyhow :)

Let's define this (3 elements per vertex) to OpenGL in triangle.cpp:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
struct attributes {
  GLfloat coord3d[3];
  GLfloat v_color[3];
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Then, in init_resources()

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  struct attributes triangle_attributes[] = {
    {{ 0.0,  0.8, 0.0}, {1.0, 1.0, 0.0}},
    {{-0.8, -0.8, 0.0}, {0.0, 0.0, 1.0}},
    {{ 0.8, -0.8, 0.0}, {1.0, 0.0, 0.0}}
  };

...

  attribute_name = &quot;coord3d&quot;;
  attribute_coord3d = glGetAttribLocation(program, attribute_name);
  if (attribute_coord3d == -1) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Could not bind attribute %s\n&quot;, attribute_name);
    return 0;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;
Change the vertices array setup in onDisplay()

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  glVertexAttribPointer(
    attribute_coord3d,   // attribute
    3,                   // number of elements per vertex, here (x,y,z)
    GL_FLOAT,            // the type of each element
    GL_FALSE,            // take our values as-is
    sizeof(struct attributes),  // next coord3d appears every 6 floats
    0                    // offset of first element
  );
&lt;/source&gt;
replace the other occurrences of 'attribute_coord2d' accordingly and tell the shader to use the new coordinate:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
attribute vec3 coord3d;
[...]
void main(void) {
  gl_Position = vec4(coord3d, 1.0);
&lt;/source&gt;

= Creating the transformation matrix =

GLM comes with built-in functions to compute rotation, translation and scaling matrices.
Let's add our transformation matrix in &lt;code&gt;onIdle()&lt;/code&gt;, and compute a progressive rotation combined with a translation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void onIdle() {
  float move = sinf(glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME) / 1000.0 * (2*3.14) / 5); // -1&lt;-&gt;+1 every 5 seconds
  float angle = glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME) / 1000.0 * 45;  // 45° per second
  glm::vec3 axis_z(0, 0, 1);
  glm::mat4 m_transform = glm::translate(glm::mat4(1.0f), glm::vec3(move, 0.0, 0.0))
    * glm::rotate(glm::mat4(1.0f), angle, axis_z);
  [...]
&lt;/source&gt;

= Passing the transformation matrix =

As we saw in the previous tutorial, we'll add a new uniform, with &lt;code&gt;glUniformMatrix4fv&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  /* Global */
  #include &lt;glm/gtc/type_ptr.hpp&gt;
  GLint uniform_m_transform;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  /* init_resources() */
  uniform_name = &quot;m_transform&quot;;
  uniform_m_transform = glGetUniformLocation(program, uniform_name);
  if (uniform_m_transform == -1) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Could not bind uniform %s\n&quot;, uniform_name);
    return 0;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  /* onIdle() */
  glUniformMatrix4fv(uniform_m_transform, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(m_transform));
&lt;/source&gt;

If you are not using GLM, it is sufficient to pass a pointer to a GLfloat[16] array, like so:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  GLfloat matrix[16] = {...};
  glUniformMatrix4fv(uniform_m_transform, 1, GL_FALSE, matrix);
&lt;/source&gt;

The vertex shader just has to multiply the vertex by the matrix as we saw above:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
uniform mat4 m_transform;
void main(void) {
  gl_Position = m_transform * vec4(coord3d, 1.0);
  [...]
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:OpenGL Tutorial Triangle rotating.png|thumb|Our triangle, transformed]]
We note that we still have the aspect ratio issue (like watching a TV show fullscreen on a 16:9 monitor).
We'll fix this in the next tutorial with the Model-View-Projection matrix.

= Experiment! =

Remember what we mentioned about applying matrices in the reverse order?  In our example, we rotate first, then translate.

Try to do it the other way around: you'll make the triangle rotate after it's been moved, which means it will rotate around the origin rather than around its own center.

I find that the difference between standard perspective and oblique perspective is confusing. Aren't they two ways to describe the same frustum? [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 15:01, 14 August 2011 (UTC)

:In the standard perspective frustum, the view direction is always to the center of the view plane. The oblique perspective frustum can be defined such that the view direction is to another point, even outside the visible rectangle of the view plane. Thus, the oblique perspective frustum is more general; i.e. you can specify any standard perspective frustum with the parameters of the oblique perspective frustum but not vice versa. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 17:47, 14 August 2011 (UTC)

::OK, thanks a lot! [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 06:23, 15 August 2011 (UTC)

== Orientation of the coordinates system ==

I see that OpenGL view is aligned with the reverse Z axis by default, and this is the orientation that is displayed in the graphics.
However in some other 3D tools, such as Blender, this is the &quot;top view&quot;.  This is also used in maths.
Maybe it is less confusing the use the same convention.

Though, I also saw a reference about Unity using a &quot;left-hand&quot; coordinate system?
[[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 15:28, 14 August 2011 (UTC)

:The idea in OpenGL is that the x view coordinate goes to the right (on the screen) and the y view coordinate goes up (on the screen). This is the standard mathematical convention. Furthermore, a right-handed coordinate system is used. (I.e. if the thumb of a right hand points to the x axis and the index finger points to the y axis, then the middle finger should point in the positive z direction.) This is also a standard mathematical convention. These restrictions already imply that the viewer looks down the negative z axis. This is an OpenGL convention that is fixed in the OpenGL specification (even the programmable pipeline assumes that you look down the negative z axis); thus, I don't think one can avoid this convention in a book/tutorial on OpenGL/GLSL. Note that this OpenGL convention for the view coordinate system has no consequences whatsoever for world coordinates. Modeling a 3D world with the z axis going up is as good as any other orientation of the 3D world. In fact, even using a left-handed world coordinate system is fine as long as the view matrix is correctly set. However, I realize that I haven't described in this page how to go from a left-handed world coordinate system to a right-handed view coordinate system. Mainly because I'm not sure about all the consequences. (For example, clockwise-polygons will become counter-clockwise polygons by this transformation. I'm not sure I'm aware of all the issues that can arise.) Also, most libraries that are built on top of OpenGL or the standard convention of a right-handed coordinate system (e.g. Blender) won't have this issue.  
:I guess Unity uses a left-handed world coordinate system because it was built with Direct3D in mind, which also uses a left-handed world coordinate system as far as I know. I never really noticed it because Unity provides the correct transformation matrices that take care of the correct transformation from left-handed world space to right-handed view space. I'll have to think about whether and where to mention this point in the Unity tutorials.--[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 17:47, 14 August 2011 (UTC)

:: The only problem/confusion that I think of, is loading several objects, one in OpenGL &quot;look-down&quot; convention, and one in Blender convention : one will be displayed with a 90° rotation on the Y axis. This happened to me when importing meshes in standard Blender ;) This will surprise the users, for instance if (s)he hand-wrote a tetrahedron/cube/etc. coordinates by hand with &quot;look-down&quot; convention, positioned the camera accordingly (look-down too), then load an external mesh and see (s)he either has to rewrite all his manual coordinates, or rotate all his manual objects, or rotate each and every mesh (s)he imports. I'll have to see what happens when I do that and decide. [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 06:23, 15 August 2011 (UTC)

::: I see what you mean. But I think that's a standard problem when importing models from different modeling tools. Also, as far as I know, OpenGL really doesn't have a convention for world space (only for view space). Thus, it might actually be a good idea to use a world space with the z axis up. This way, the difference between world space and view space should be obvious. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 08:13, 15 August 2011 (UTC)

:::: O well, I just tried to use a reflection map in Blender and got completely confused: isn't +Z supposed to be top in Blender? On the other hand, the description for cube maps on [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Build a skybox]] appears to follow the OpenGL convention. But then, when I tried to use that map in Blender with a GLSL shader it doesn't seem to map it to the faces of a cube map the way that wikibook page describes it. Do you have any experience with skyboxes in Blender? Is that wikibooks page still valid for Blender 2.58? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 10:12, 15 August 2011 (UTC)

::::: I don't have experience with Blender skyboxes; looking at the screenshots, the coordinates (at the bottom-left corner) seem to follow the &quot;Z is up&quot; convention, but indeed this disagrees with the explanations about the cube faces..
::::: You're right that bad orientation is a common issue, users will encounter it anyway and we have to cover it. [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 11:00, 15 August 2011 (UTC)

:::::: Actually, that Blender 3D wikibook page appears to label the faces according to the Direct3D convention. Confusing. In any case, the cube map is apparently in the correct format for Blender 2.58 (the preview is fine with the sky at the top), I only had to negate the z coordinate and swap it with the y coordinate in the GLSL shader. Thus, this is probably just the different +Z=up convention in Blender. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 13:28, 15 August 2011 (UTC)


I just saw that using the Blender &quot;Z is up&quot; coordinates system in OpenGL introduces issues:
* .obj files are usually in &quot;Y is up&quot;, requiring changes when loading them (or when exporting them from Blender)
* the camera is in &quot;Y is up&quot;, which requires confusing work-arounds when controlling it with keyboard (to move left/right, you rotate on Y axis in view coordinates - not Z)
* as far as I understand, other engines such as Irrlicht and Ogre also use &quot;Y is up&quot;
I guess it's best to stick with &quot;Y is up&quot;.
Time to fix the objects and lights coordinates in my tutorials T-T [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] ([[User talk:Beuc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Beuc|contribs]]) 07:37, 11 September 2011 (UTC)
: Well, I guess &quot;Y is up&quot; will make the code somewhat simpler since it is the default in OpenGL. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 14:21, 12 September 2011 (UTC)</text>

[[File:Le Caravage - L'incrédulité de Saint Thomas.jpg|300px|thumb|left|“The Incredulity of Saint Thomas” by Caravaggio, 1601-1603.]]
This tutorial covers '''normal mapping'''.

It's the first of two tutorials about texturing techniques that go beyond two-dimensional surfaces (or layers of surfaces). In this tutorial, we start with normal mapping, which is a very well established technique to fake the lighting of small bumps and dents — even on coarse polygon meshes. The code of this tutorial is based on the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Smooth Specular Highlights|tutorial on smooth specular highlights]] and the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Textured Spheres|tutorial on textured spheres]].

===Perceiving Shapes Based on Lighting===
The painting by Caravaggio that is depicted to the left is about the incredulity of Saint Thomas, who did not believe in Christ's resurrection until he put his finger in Christ's side. The furrowed brows of the apostles not only symbolize this incredulity but clearly convey it by means of a common facial expression. However, why do we know that their foreheads are actually furrowed instead of being painted with some light and dark lines? After all, this is just a flat painting. In fact, viewers intuitively make the assumption that these are furrowed instead of painted brows — even though the painting itself allows for both interpretations. The lesson is: bumps on smooth surfaces can often be convincingly conveyed by the lighting alone without any other cues (shadows, occlusions, parallax effects, stereo, etc.). 

===Normal Mapping===
Normal mapping tries to convey bumps on smooth surfaces (i.e. coarse triangle meshes with interpolated normals) by changing the surface normal vectors according to some virtual bumps. When the lighting is computed with these modified normal vectors, viewers will often perceive the virtual bumps — even though a perfectly flat triangle has been rendered. The illusion can certainly break down (in particular at silhouettes) but in many cases it is very convincing.

More specifically, the normal vectors that represent the virtual bumps are first '''encoded''' in a texture image (i.e. a normal map). A fragment shader then looks up these vectors up in the texture image and computes the lighting based on them. That's about it. The problem, of course, is the encoding of the normal vectors in a texture image. There are different possibilities and the fragment shader has to be adapted to the specific encoding that was used to generate the normal map.

[[File:IntP Brick NormalMap.png|200px|thumb|left|A typical example for the appearance of an encoded normal map.]]
===Normal Mapping in Blender===
Normal maps are supported by Blender; see the [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Normal_Mapping|description in the Blender 3D: Noob to Pro wikibook]]. Here, however, we will use the normal map to the left and write a GLSL shader to use it. 

For this tutorial, you should use a cube mesh instead of the UV sphere that was used in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Textured Spheres|tutorial on textured spheres]]. Apart from that you can follow the same steps to assign a material and the texture image to the object. Note that you should specify a default '''UV Map''' in the '''Properties window &gt; Object Data tab'''. Furthermore, you should specify '''Coordinates &gt; UV''' in the '''Properties window &gt; Textures tab &gt; Mapping'''.

When decoding the normal information, it would be best to know how the data was encoded. However, there are not so many choices; thus, even if you don't know how the normal map was encoded, a bit of experimentation can often lead to sufficiently good results. First of all, the RGB components are numbers between 0 and 1; however, they usually represent coordinates between -1 and 1 in a local surface coordinate system (since the vector is normalized, none of the coordinates can be greater than +1 or less than -1). Thus, the mapping from RGB components to coordinates of the normal vector '''n''' &lt;math&gt;= (n_x,n_y,n_z)&lt;/math&gt; could be:

&lt;math&gt;n_x = 2 R - 1&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n_y = 2 G - 1&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n_z = 2 B - 1&lt;/math&gt;

However, the &lt;math&gt;n_z&lt;/math&gt; coordinate is usually positive (because surface normals are not allowed to point inwards). This can be exploited by using a different mapping for &lt;math&gt;n_z&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;n_x = 2 R - 1&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n_y = 2 G - 1&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;n_z = B&lt;/math&gt;

If in doubt, the latter decoding should be chosen because it will never generate surface normals that point inwards. Furthermore, it is often necessary to normalize the resulting vector.

An implementation in a fragment shader that computes the normalized vector '''n''' &lt;math&gt;= (n_x,n_y,n_z)&lt;/math&gt; in the variable &lt;code&gt;localCoords&lt;/code&gt; could be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            vec4 encodedNormal = texture2D(normalMap, vec2(texCoords)); 
            vec3 localCoords = 
               normalize(vec3(2.0, 2.0, 1.0) * vec3(encodedNormal) 
               - vec3(1.0, 1.0, 0.0)); 
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:Image Tangent-plane.svg|200px|thumb|left|Tangent plane to a point on a sphere.]]
Usually, a local surface coordinate systems for each point of the surface is used to specify normal vectors in the normal map. The &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis of this local coordinates system is given by the smooth, interpolated normal vector '''N''' and the &lt;math&gt;x-y&lt;/math&gt; plane is a tangent plane to the surface as illustrated in the image to the left. Specifically, the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis is specified by the tangent attribute '''T''' that Blender provides to vertices (see the discussion of attributes in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Debugging of Shaders|tutorial about debugging of shaders]]). Given the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis, the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis can be computed by a cross product in the vertex shader, e.g. '''B''' = '''T''' × '''N'''. (The letter '''B''' refers to the traditional name “binormal” for this vector.) 

Note that the normal vector '''N''' is transformed with the transpose of the inverse model-view matrix from object space to view space (because it is orthogonal to a surface; see [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Applying Matrix Transformations|“Applying Matrix Transformations”]]) while the tangent vector '''T''' specifies a direction between points on a surface and is therefore transformed with the model-view matrix. The binormal vector '''B''' represents a third class of vectors which are transformed differently. (If you really want to know: the skew-symmetric matrix B corresponding to “'''B'''×” is transformed like a quadratic form.) Thus, the best choice is to first transform '''N''' and '''T''' to view space, and then to compute '''B''' in view space using the cross product of the transformed vectors.

Also note that the configuration of these axes depends on the tangent data that is provided, the encoding of the normal map, and the texture coordinates. However, the axes are practically always orthogonal and a bluish tint of the normal map indicates that the blue component is in the direction of the interpolated normal vector. 

With the normalized directions '''T''', '''B''', and '''N''' in view space, we can easily form a matrix that maps any normal vector '''n''' of the normal map from the local surface coordinate system to view space because the columns of such a matrix are just the vectors of the axes; thus, the 3×3 matrix for the mapping of '''n''' to view space is:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M}_{\text{surface}\to \text{view}} = \left[ \begin{matrix}
T_x &amp; B_x &amp; N_x \\
T_y &amp; B_y &amp; N_y \\
T_z &amp; B_z &amp; N_z 
\end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

These calculations are performed by the vertex shader, for example this way:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         attribute vec4 tangent;

         varying mat3 localSurface2View; // mapping from 
            // local surface coordinates to view coordinates
         varying vec4 texCoords; // texture coordinates
         varying vec4 position; // position in view coordinates

         void main()
         {				
            // the signs and whether tangent is in localSurface2View[1] 
            //   or localSurface2View[0] depends on the tangent  
            //   attribute, texture coordinates, and the encoding 
            //   of the normal map

            // gl_NormalMatrix is precalculated inverse transpose of
            //   the gl_ModelViewMatrix; using this preserves data
            //   during non-uniform scaling of the mesh

            // localSurface2View[1] is multiplied by the cross sign of
            //   the tangent, in tangent.w; this allows mirrored UVs
            //   (tangent.w is 1 when normal, -1 when mirrored)

            localSurface2View[0] = normalize(gl_NormalMatrix 
               * tangent.xyz);
            localSurface2View[2] = 
               normalize(gl_NormalMatrix * gl_Normal);
            localSurface2View[1] = normalize(
               cross(localSurface2View[2], localSurface2View[0])
               * tangent.w);

            texCoords = gl_MultiTexCoord0;
            position = gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex;            
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
&lt;/source&gt;

In the fragment shader, we multiply this matrix with '''n''' (i.e. &lt;code&gt;localCoords&lt;/code&gt;). For example, with this line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            vec3 normalDirection = 
               normalize(localSurface2View * localCoords);
&lt;/source&gt;

With the new normal vector in view space, we can compute the lighting as in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Smooth Specular Highlights|tutorial on smooth specular highlights]].

===Complete Shader Code===
The complete fragment shader simply integrates all the snippets and the per-pixel lighting from the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Smooth Specular Highlights|tutorial on smooth specular highlights]]. Also, we have to request tangent attributes and set the texture sampler (make sure that the normal map is in the first position of the list of textures or adapt the second argument of the call to &lt;code&gt;setSampler&lt;/code&gt;). The Python script is then:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
import bge

cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()

VertexShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
         attribute vec4 tangent;

         varying mat3 localSurface2View; // mapping from 
            // local surface coordinates to view coordinates
         varying vec4 texCoords; // texture coordinates
         varying vec4 position; // position in view coordinates

         void main()
         {				
            // the signs and whether tangent is in localSurface2View[1] 
            //   or localSurface2View[0] depends on the tangent  
            //   attribute, texture coordinates, and the encoding 
            //   of the normal map

            // gl_NormalMatrix is precalculated inverse transpose of
            //   the gl_ModelViewMatrix; using this preserves data
            //   during non-uniform scaling of the mesh

            // localSurface2View[1] is multiplied by the cross sign of
            //   the tangent, in tangent.w; this allows mirrored UVs
            //   (tangent.w is 1 when normal, -1 when mirrored)

            localSurface2View[0] = normalize(gl_NormalMatrix 
               * tangent.xyz);
            localSurface2View[2] = 
               normalize(gl_NormalMatrix * gl_Normal);
            localSurface2View[1] = normalize(
               cross(localSurface2View[2], localSurface2View[0])
               * tangent.w);
 
            texCoords = gl_MultiTexCoord0;
            position = gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex;            
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
&quot;&quot;&quot;

FragmentShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
         varying mat3 localSurface2View; // mapping from 
            // local surface coordinates to view coordinates
         varying vec4 texCoords; // texture coordinates
         varying vec4 position; // position in view coordinates

         uniform sampler2D normalMap;
        
         void main()
         {
            // in principle we have to normalize the columns of 
            // &quot;localSurface2View&quot; again; however, the potential 
            // problems are small since we use this matrix only
            // to compute &quot;normalDirection&quot;, which we normalize anyways
 
            vec4 encodedNormal = texture2D(normalMap, vec2(texCoords)); 
            
            vec3 localCoords = 
               normalize(vec3(2.0, 2.0, 1.0) * vec3(encodedNormal) 
               - vec3(1.0, 1.0, 0.0)); 
               // constants depend on encoding

            } 
            else // point light or spotlight (or other kind of light) 
            {
               vec3 positionToLightSource = 
                  vec3(gl_LightSource[0].position - position);
               float distance = length(positionToLightSource);
               attenuation = 1.0 / distance; // linear attenuation 
               lightDirection = normalize(positionToLightSource);

                  if (clampedCosine &lt; gl_LightSource[0].spotCosCutoff) 
                     // outside of spotlight cone?
                  {
                     attenuation = 0.0;
                  }
                  else
                  {
                     attenuation = attenuation * pow(clampedCosine, 
                        gl_LightSource[0].spotExponent);   
                  }

            }
 
            vec3 ambientLighting = vec3(gl_LightModel.ambient)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Our triangle animation is fun, but we're learning OpenGL to see 3D graphics.

Let's create a cube!

= Adding the 3rd dimension =

[[File:Field of view angle in view frustum.png|thumb|Coordinate system|400px]]

A cube is 8 vertices in the 3D space (4 points in the front face, 4 in the back face).
&lt;code&gt;triangle&lt;/code&gt; can be renamed to &lt;code&gt;cube&lt;/code&gt;.
Also comment out the &lt;code&gt;fade&lt;/code&gt; bindings.

Now let's write our cube vertices.  We'll position our (X,Y,Z) coordinate system like in this picture.  We'll write them so they are related to the center of the object.  It's cleaner, and it will allow us to rotate the cube around its center later:

Note: here, the Z coordinate is towards the user.  You may find other conventions such as Z towards the top (height) in Blender, but OpenGL's default is Y-is-up.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  GLfloat cube_vertices[] = {
    // front
    -1.0, -1.0,  1.0,
     1.0, -1.0,  1.0,
     1.0,  1.0,  1.0,
    -1.0,  1.0,  1.0,
    // back
    -1.0, -1.0, -1.0,
     1.0, -1.0, -1.0,
     1.0,  1.0, -1.0,
    -1.0,  1.0, -1.0,
  };
&lt;/source&gt;

To see something better than a black mass, we'll also define some colors:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  GLfloat cube_colors[] = {
    // front colors
    1.0, 0.0, 0.0,
    0.0, 1.0, 0.0,
    0.0, 0.0, 1.0,
    1.0, 1.0, 1.0,
    // back colors
    1.0, 0.0, 0.0,
    0.0, 1.0, 0.0,
    0.0, 0.0, 1.0,
    1.0, 1.0, 1.0,
  };
&lt;/source&gt;

Don't forget the global buffer handles:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
GLuint vbo_cube_vertices, vbo_cube_colors;
&lt;/source&gt;

= Elements - Index Buffer Objects (IBO) =

Our cube has 6 faces.
Two faces may share some vertices. In addition we'll write our face as a combination of 2 triangles (so 12 triangles total).

Consequently we'll introduce the concept of elements: we use &lt;code&gt;glDrawElements&lt;/code&gt;, instead of &lt;code&gt;glDrawArrays&lt;/code&gt;. It takes a set of indices that refer to the vertices array. With &lt;code&gt;glDrawElements&lt;/code&gt;, we can specify any order, and even the same vertex several times.  We'll store these indices in an Index Buffer Object (IBO).

It is better to specify all faces in a similar way, here counter-clockwise, because it will be important for texture mapping (see next tutorial) and lighting (so triangle normals need to point to the right way).
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* Global */
GLuint ibo_cube_elements;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* init_resources */
  GLushort cube_elements[] = {
    // front
    0, 1, 2,
    2, 3, 0,
    // top
    3, 2, 6,
    6, 7, 3,
    // back
    7, 6, 5,
    5, 4, 7,
    // bottom
    4, 5, 1,
    1, 0, 4,
    // left
    4, 0, 3,
    3, 7, 4,
    // right
    1, 5, 6,
    6, 2, 1,
  };
  glGenBuffers(1, &amp;ibo_cube_elements);
  glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, ibo_cube_elements);
  glBufferData(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(cube_elements), cube_elements, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
  glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that we used a buffer object again, but with &lt;code&gt;GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;GL_ARRAY_BUFFER&lt;/code&gt;.

We can tell OpenGL to draw our cube in &lt;code&gt;onDisplay&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, ibo_cube_elements);
  int size;  glGetBufferParameteriv(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, GL_BUFFER_SIZE, &amp;size);
  glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, size/sizeof(GLushort), GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;

We use &lt;code&gt;glGetBufferParameteriv&lt;/code&gt; to grab the buffer size. This way, we don't have to declare &lt;code&gt;cube_elements&lt;/code&gt;.

= Enabling depth =

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);
//glDepthFunc(GL_LESS);
&lt;/source&gt;

 glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT'''|GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT''');

We now can see the square front face, but to see the other faces of the cube, we need to rotate it.
We still can peek by removing one (or both!) of the front face's triangle. :)

= Model-View-Projection matrix =

Until now, we've worked with object coordinates, specified around the object's center. To work with multiple objects, and position each object in the 3D world, we compute a transformation matrix that will:
* shift from model (object) coordinates to world coordinates (model-&gt;world)
* then from world coordinates to view (camera) coordinates (world-&gt;view)
* then from view coordinates to projection (2D screen) coordinates (view-&gt;projection)
This will also take care of our aspect ratio issue.

The goal is to compute a global transformation matrix, called MVP, that we'll apply on each vertex to get the final 2D point on the screen.

Note that the 2D screen coordinates are in the [-1,1] interval. There is a 4th non-matrix step to convert these to [0, screen_size], controlled by &lt;code&gt;glViewPort&lt;/code&gt;.

History note: OpenGL 1.x had two built-in matrices, accessible through &lt;code&gt;glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW)&lt;/code&gt;. Here we're replacing those, plus we're adding a camera :)

Let's add our code in the &lt;code&gt;onIdle&lt;/code&gt; function, where we updated the &lt;code&gt;fade&lt;/code&gt; uniform in the previous tutorial. We'll pass a &lt;code&gt;mvp&lt;/code&gt; uniform instead.

Start: at the beginning of each phase, we have an identity matrix, that does no transformation at all, created using &lt;code&gt;glm::mat4(1.0f)&lt;/code&gt;.

Model: we'll push our cube a bit in the background, so it doesn't mix with the camera:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  glm::mat4 model = glm::translate(glm::mat4(1.0f), glm::vec3(0.0, 0.0, -4.0));
&lt;/source&gt;
View: GLM provides a re-implementation of [http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/gluLookAt.xml gluLookAt(eye, center, up)]. eye is the position of the camera, center is where the camera is pointed to, and up is the top of the camera (in case it's tilted). Let's center on our object from a bit above, with the camera straight:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  glm::mat4 view = glm::lookAt(glm::vec3(0.0, 2.0, 0.0), glm::vec3(0.0, 0.0, -4.0), glm::vec3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0));
&lt;/source&gt;

Projection: GLM also provides a re-implementation of [http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/gluPerspective.xml gluPerspective(fovy, aspect, zNear, zFar)]. fovy is the lens angle, aspect is the screen aspect ratio (width/height), zNear and zFar are the clipping plane (min/max depth), both positive, zNear usually small not equal to zero. We need to see up to our square, so we can use 10 for zFar:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  glm::mat4 projection = glm::perspective(45.0f, 1.0f*screen_width/screen_height, 0.1f, 10.0f);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;screen_width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;screen_height&lt;/code&gt; are new global variables to define the size of the window:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* global */
int screen_width=800, screen_height=600;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* main */
  glutInitWindowSize(screen_width, screen_height);
&lt;/source&gt;


Result:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  glm::mat4 mvp = projection * view * model;
&lt;/source&gt;

We can pass it to the shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  /* Global */
  #include &lt;glm/gtc/type_ptr.hpp&gt;
  GLint uniform_mvp;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  /* init_resources() */
  const char* uniform_name;
  uniform_name = &quot;mvp&quot;;
  uniform_mvp = glGetUniformLocation(program, uniform_name);
  if (uniform_mvp == -1) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Could not bind uniform %s\n&quot;, uniform_name);
    return 0;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  /* onIdle() */
  glUniformMatrix4fv(uniform_mvp, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(mvp));
&lt;/source&gt;

And in the shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
uniform mat4 mvp;
void main(void) {
  gl_Position = mvp * vec4(coord3d, 1.0);
  [...]
&lt;/source&gt;

= Animation =

[[File:OpenGL_Tutorial_Cube_primary_colors.png|thumb|Our cube, rotating]]
To animate the object, we can simply apply additional transformations before the Model matrix.

To rotate the cube, we can add in &lt;code&gt;onIdle&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  float angle = glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME) / 1000.0 * 45;  // 45° per second
  glm::vec3 axis_y(0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
  glm::mat4 anim = glm::rotate(glm::mat4(1.0f), angle, axis_y);
  [...]
  glm::mat4 mvp = projection * view * model * anim;
&lt;/source&gt;

We've made the traditional flying rotating cube!

= Window resize =

To support sizing the GLUT window, you can use &lt;code&gt;glutReshapeFunc&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void onReshape(int width, int height) {
  screen_width = width;
  screen_height = height;
  glViewport(0, 0, screen_width, screen_height);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* main */
    glutReshapeFunc(onReshape);
&lt;/source&gt;

Note: the scene tends to be jumpy when resizing - I couldn't figure out where that came from.

The headline of the October 15, 1947 Birmingham News reads, &quot;One Armed Quarterback Leads Team to Fifth Straight Victory.&quot; Stump is quarterback for his high school. He has made 33 of 37 attempted passes in the season. The article goes on to say that he is also on the baseball and basketball teams. He is quoted as saying his Aunt Idgie taught him everything he knows about football.

== Analysis ==
Stump has overcome his disability and become a star player in not one, but three sports. He rightly credits Idgie. She is responsible not only for his skill in football, but for teaching him that he could overcome his disability and enjoy life. He learned this the day she took him to Eva's and played ball with the three-legged dog.

On June 3, 1946, Idgie is at Eva's house drinking beer. Eva notices that Idgie seems upset and asks her what is wrong. Idgie tells her Ruth has moved out because Idgie lied to her. Idgie said she was going to her sister, Leona's house, but went into the woods to be by herself. Eva says that it is a shame because she remembers how upset Idgie was when Ruth left to marry Frank. She tells Idgie to watch out because Ruth could have anyone in town with a snap of her fingers. A few days later, Ruth called Idgie for the first time in three weeks. She got Idgie's note and wants to talk. Idgie is almost at Ninny and Cleo's house when she realizes she never sent a note.

== Analysis ==
Ruth and Idgie have problems like every other couple. With Mrs. Thredgood's death Idgie has withdrawn from the person she loves the most &amp; now she fears that she may have lost her again. However, with the help of Eva, Idgie &amp; Ruth make up with one another &amp; Ruth moves back in with Idgie

The scene returns to the Rose Terrace Nursing Home on August 15, 1986. Evelyn is not visiting, but Mrs. Threadgoode is speaking to Geneene, the black nurse. Geneene is in their room having a cigarette and Ninny tells her that Evelyn is going through menopause. She has even thought of smashing his head with a baseball bat. Mrs. Threadgoode says that is what happens when a couple is together for a long time; they get on each other's nerves. Even Ruth and Idgie had problems once and Ruth moved in with Ninny and Cleo for a while. She tells Geneene about Towanda and Evelyn's fantasies. Ninny doesn't think it's up to people to judge, only God.

==Analysis==
Ninny Threadgoode is concerned about her friend. She expresses her concerns to the nurse. This chapter is the first time the reader hears of problems between Ruth and Idgie.

The headline in the August 1, 1945 issue of The Weems Weekly reads &quot;Man Falls in Lacquer.&quot; Dot writes that she wouldn't believe it if she weren't married to him. It happened at the railroad yard and Opal had to come cut the lacquer out of his hair. She asks if any of her readers know of a good babysitter for a husband. The war is over and the boys are home. Ninny and Albert brought Dot a four-leaf clover they found in their yard. Dot thanks them in her article.

==Analysis==
The majority of this article focuses on Dot's husband. She again portrays him as simple. At the end, there is a mention of Ninny and Albert.

The February 24, 1944 issue of The Weems Weekly has a headline that reads, &quot;Icebox Follies a Sidesplitter.&quot; The event is an annual show put on by the Dill Pickle Club. Grady Kilgore is Shirley Temple and sings &quot;On the Good Ship Lollipop.&quot; Wilbur sings and Dot thinks he is good, but she is used to hearing him sing in the shower. The funds raised will be used to help the needy in Whistle Stop. Dot hopes the war will be over because everyone misses the boys. She is glad Wilbur is old and has flat feet, so he doesn't have to go.

==Analysis==
The Dill Pickle Club is alive and well. The club does charity work all along, but tries to hide behind the fishing, drinking and crazy stories. They raise money to help needy neighbors with the show.

Evelyn is visiting Mrs. Threadgoode in the Rose Terrace Nursing home on July 28, 1986. She has gained back all the weight she lost and eight pounds over. They are eating a five-pound box of fudge. Mrs. Threadgoode is commenting about how rude people have become. She tells Evelyn that Mrs. Otis offered a colored boy in the supermarket parking lot a nickel to carry her groceries to her car, but he just gave her a mean look and walked away. Ninny talks about the black people on television and tells Evelyn that Sipsey would have had Big George's hide if he had spoken like they did. She tells Evelyn it's not just the colored people, but white people are rude now too. Ninny only watches religious programming now. She thinks all the bad news is what is causing people to change.

This chapter takes place in Whistle Stop on July 18, 1924. Ruth is awakened to Idgie knocking on her bedroom window. She invites Ruth on a picnic. When Ruth suggests they ask her sisters to come, Idgie tells Ruth she wants her all to herself. Besides, she already asked them and they don't want to go. Idgie tells Ruth she will meet her in the car, but doesn't mention that she stole Julian's keys and wants to be gone before he wakes up.

Idgie leads Ruth to an old oak tree and makes her promise not to tell anyone what she is about to see. Idgie walks up to the tree with a jar in her hand and sticks her arm into the hole in the tree. After being covered with swarming bees, she walks slowly back to Ruth. By the time she gets back to Ruth, the bees have flown away &amp; Idgie is completely unharmed &amp; offers the honey to Ruth. Ruth, however, breaks down crying, telling Idgie that she thought that she had gotten killed. Idgie aplogies to Ruth &amp; tells her that she didn't mean to scare her &amp; tells her that she does this all the time &amp; that she never gets stung. Ruth then hugs Idgie, telling her that she wouldn't know what to do if she had lost her &amp; calls Idgie a bee charmer; the two then have there picnic.

==Analysis==

This chapter is the turning point for the relationship between Ruth &amp; Idgie, up until now Ruth has been suppressing her true feelings for Idgie, putting them to just friends or sisterly. However, she is terrified the moment she thinks that Idgie may be dead &amp; when she sees that Idgie is alive she hugs Idgie &amp; tells her that she doesn't know what she would do if she lost her.

The two young girls then begin to have a romantic picnic, all the while Ruth seems to slowly become more &amp; more aware of her feelings for Idgie, which seems to scare her more then anything.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Reverse Programming is a process of coding an initial application or functional portion without an upfront design through an inventive top down process.

The method can be demonstrated using a simple math tree.  First you start with your answer, say 9.  Then you decide how you would arrive at 9, of the many possibilities you choose 4+5.  Now you have 9=4+5.  You can proceed to replace the 4 and 5 with a further math function. Suppose 4=2*2 and 5 = 3+2, so now the final formula would be 9=(2*2)+(3+2).  The process can continue indefinitely.  The point being is that you did not know up front how you would arrive at 9 but were able to start immediately without planning.

In the case of software development it is possible to start with the end result, at each stage of working backwards you can use constants and then replace those constants with functions or objects, etc.

The nice thing about this process is that it helps not to &quot;over design&quot; as the choice of each step backwards is usually the simplest.

Reverse programming was developed by William Egge by video recording his code edits and then reviewing them.  He was inspired by the difficulty and being overwhelmed by complex problems and wanted an easier method that &quot;flowed&quot; without having to design up front.

The story continues in Whistle Stop on August 29, 1924. Ruth knows the exact moment she began to love Idgie. It was the moment Idgie handed her the jar of honey. Until that time, Ruth had been trying to hold back her feelings. She felt she had to leave because at sixteen, Idgie couldn't understand the feelings and implications of those feelings. She felt the only answer was to return home and marry Frank Bennett. Idgie would get over her crush once Ruth was gone.

Idgie went crazy at the news of Ruth's impending marriage. Idgie was in her room smashing everything. Mrs. Threadgoode begs Ruth to talk to her but this does no good as. Ninny and Momma stood outside the door. Ninny had her fingers in her ears. Idgie screams at Ruth, telling her she can't love Frank. Ruth swears that she does, but Idgie doesn't believe her. Idgie goes into a rage Idgie demeandes that Ruth tells her that she loves her &amp; Ruth saying that she doesn't &amp; that Idgie only has a crush &amp; will get over it. Things ends after Ruth slaps Idgie when she doesn't stop screaming, at that moment Ruth desires to hug Idgie, but knows that if she does she will never be able to let go &amp; then leaves for her room.

==Analysis==

As shown in the last chapter, Ruth has come to realize that she is in love with Idgie. However, because Idgie is so young so she does what she believes to be the right thing to do, she leaves to get married to the man she has been promised to, no matter how much she loves Idgie &amp; believes that once she has gone she &amp; Idgie will get over one another. However, when Ruth &amp; Idgie begin arguing with one another, Ruth has a difficult time controlling what she truly feels &amp; forces herself to leave, know that if she attempts to comfort Idgie, she will not be able to leave her.

The story returns to the Rose Terrace Nursing Home on February 9, 1986. Evelyn brings Taco Bell and Ninny is excited because other than Franco American spaghetti, this is the first &quot;foreign food&quot; she has ever eaten. Evelyn is anxious to find out what happened to Idgie and Ruth, and she asks if Ruth did leave that summer. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Threadgoode pleaded with Ruth to stay and help get Idgie through her senior year, but Ruth said she had to leave because she was getting married in the fall. Sipsey, however, said Ruth didn't want to leave because her pillow was wet with tears every morning. The night before Ruth left Idgie took one of Buddy's trophies and broke all the windows in her room. The next day Idgie left and never went back to school. She only came home for weddings and when her father had a heart attack. Big George is now the only person that knows where Idgie is, but never tells anyone where she is oout respect. However, when ever Mrs. Threadgooda asks him to asks Idgie to come by he makes sure that Idgie gets the message.

 New UNIX password: '''racattack'''
 BAD PASSWORD: it is based on a dictionary word
 Retype new UNIX password: '''racattack'''
 passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
Create directories.

 [root@collabn1 ~]# '''mkdir -p /u01/grid/oracle/product/11.2.0/grid_1'''
 [root@collabn1 ~]# '''mkdir -p /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/db_1'''

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
'''Close '''and''' re-open''' your terminal sessions so that the new profiles take effect.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
Install '''fix_cssd''' script.

{{Info|In VMware test environments you usually have a very small amount of memory.  Oracle CSS processes can take up a *LOT* of the memory (over 50% in this lab) because it locks several hundred MB in physical memory.  In VMware (for both ASM and RAC environments) this may be undesirable.  This low-level hack will make the memory swappable at runtime.

'''NEVER, EVER, EVER EVEN IN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS THINK ABOUT TRYING THIS ON ANYTHING CLOSE TO A PRODUCTION SYSTEM.'''

The source code for this file can be found at https://github.com/ardentperf/racattack/blob/master/makeDVD/root/fix_cssd/fix_cssd.sh}}

 [oracle@collabn1 ~]$ '''su - root'''
 [root@collabn1 ~]# '''cd /'''
 [root@collabn1 ~]# '''tar xvf mnt/*/fix_cssd.tar'''
 root/fix_cssd/fix_cssd.sh
 
 [root@collabn1 ~]# '''chmod 774 /root/fix_cssd/fix_cssd.sh'''
 [root@collabn1 ~]# '''gedit /etc/rc.d/rc.local'''
 cd /root/fix_cssd
 nohup nice -n -20 ./fix_cssd.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
 
 [root@collabn1 ~]# '''/etc/rc.d/rc.local'''
 nohup: appending output to `nohup.out'

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

''After completing the previous lab, you should already be logged in as the '''oracle''' user on '''collabn1'''.  You should already have a terminal open, where you are currently switched to the '''root''' user.''

----
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
As the '''root''' user, '''CONFIRM''' that the IP address if '''eth0 '''starts with '''192.168.78''' and that the IP address of '''eth1''' starts with '''172.16.100'''.

 [root@collabn1 ~]# '''ifconfig|grep net'''
 ''' eth0'''      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:0C:29:07:F5:C0
           inet addr:'''192.168.78.128'''  Bcast:192.168.78.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
           inet6 addr: fe80::20c:29ff:fe07:f5c0/64 Scope:Link
 ''' eth1'''      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:0C:29:07:F5:CA
           inet addr:'''172.16.100.128'''  Bcast:172.16.100.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
           inet6 addr: fe80::20c:29ff:fe07:f5ca/64 Scope:Link
           inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
           inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
Update the IP addresses by directly editing the linux network configuration files.  Update the BOOTPROTO line and add the remaining lines.

 [root@collabn1 ~]# cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
 [root@collabn1 network-scripts]# gedit ifcfg-eth0
 BOOTPROTO=none
 IPADDR=192.168.78.51
 NETMASK=255.255.255.0
 GATEWAY=192.168.78.2
 [root@collabn1 network-scripts]# gedit ifcfg-eth1
 BOOTPROTO=none
 IPADDR=172.16.100.51
 NETMASK=255.255.255.0

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
Update the DNS search domain

 [root@collabn1 network-scripts]# gedit /etc/resolv.conf
 search vm.ardentperf.com
 nameserver 192.168.78.2

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
As '''root''', restart the network services by typing '''service network restart'''.   Then confirm the new ip addresses with '''ifconfig'''.  Also confirm the search domain by inspecting '''/etc/resolv.conf''' – if the file has reverted then edit it again.  (When I wrote this lab, the change stuck after the second time I edited the file.)

{{Warning|You must perform this step in VMware; do not use PuTTY.}}
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:RA-oel-network-restart.png|none|border|550px]]

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
Edit '''/etc/ hosts'''.  '''EDIT '''the line with '''127.0.0.1''' and then '''ADD '''all of the other lines below:

 [root@collabn1 etc]# '''vi /etc/hosts'''
 192.168.78.51   collabn1 collabn1.vm.ardentperf.com

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
In the VMware console, go to the '''Virtual Machine''' menu and choose '''Add Virtual Machine to Inventory'''.
[[File:RA-vmweb-addmachine.png|none|border|400px]]

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
Browse to '''RAC11g/collabn2''' and open '''collabn1.vmx'''.  Make sure you browse to the right folder!
[[File:RA-vmweb-addmachine-browse.png|none|border|550px]]

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
In the '''Inventory''' tab at the left, select the new VM – '''collabn2'''.  Choose the '''Console''' tab and click the play button to start the VM.
[[File:RA-vmweb-console.png|none|border|400px]]

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
The VMware console should ask you whether you copied or moved the VM.  Answer that you '''copied''' the files and click '''OK'''.
[[File:RA-vmweb-startup-prompt-move.png|none|border|550px]]

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
When you see the square boxes, click anywhere to open a console window.
[[File:RA-vmweb-console-only.png|none|border|550px]]

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
Login as the '''oracle''' user with the password '''racattack'''.
[[File:RA-oel-login-oracle.png|none|border|550px]]

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
Open a terminal ( '''Applications &gt;&gt; Accessories &gt;&gt; Terminal''' ) and switch to the '''root '''user.
{{Info|When you first open a console on collabn2, you will notice that the hostname still says '''collabn1'''.  This is because we copied the machine; we will change the hostname shortly.}}
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:RA-oel-console-collabn2-first.png|none|border|550px]]

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
'''CONFIRM''' that the IP address of '''eth1''' starts with '''172.16.100'''.

 [root@collabn1 ~]# '''ifconfig|grep net'''
 '''eth1'''      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:0C:29:C9:3E:C8

           inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
Update the IP addresses by directly editing the linux network configuration files.  Update the BOOTPROTO line and add the remaining lines.  

'''COMMENT or DELETE''' the line which begins with HWADDR.

Update the DNS search domain

 [root@collabn1 network-scripts]# '''gedit /etc/resolv.conf'''
 search vm.ardentperf.com
 nameserver 192.168.78.2

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
Update the HOSTNAME by editing the linux system configuration files.  Set it to '''collabn2.vm.ardentperf.com'''.  Then change the active system hostname with the '''hostname '''command.

 [root@collabn1 network-scripts]# '''gedit /etc/sysconfig/network'''
 HOSTNAME=collabn2.vm.ardentperf.com
 [root@collabn1 network-scripts]# '''hostname collabn2.vm.ardentperf.com'''

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
As '''root''', restart the network services by typing '''service network restart'''.   Then confirm the new ip addresses with '''ifconfig'''.  Confirm that search domain by inspecting '''/etc/resolv.conf''' – if the file has reverted then edit it again. (The change stuck after the second time I edited the file while walking through this lab.)  Also confirm the new hostname with '''hostname'''.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
Exit your terminal session and start a new one so that you can see the updated hostname in the prompt.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;margin-top:3em&quot;&gt;
Edit '''/etc/hosts'''.  '''EDIT '''the line with '''127.0.0.1''' and then '''ADD '''all of the other lines below:

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Chapter 25}}

This chapter returns to the Rose Terrace Nursing Home on February 2, 1986. Evelyn arrives and Ninny tells her she just missed Ninny's neighbor from Whistle Stop. Ninny starts talking about Idgie and how she would run off like a wild animal when anyone tried to love her. Sipsey said it was because Mother had eaten wild game when she was pregnant. She changed when Ruth came to stay one summer. Ruth had come to run the youth activities at Mother's church. Ninny describes Ruth as sweet and shy. She came from a very religious family; her father was a preacher. Ruth was twenty-one and Idgie was fifteen or sixteen.

Idgie used to stare at Ruth and would show off when Ruth was watching. Idgie never ate at the table, however that changed when table one day at Ruth's request. Mother told the kids that their sister had a crush &amp; tells them not to laugh at their sister when comes down. However, when Ruth simply asks Idgie if she would like some string bings Idgie blushes &amp; the other Threadgooda children laugh themselves silly, prompting Mrs Threadgooda to making them leave the kitchen. Once they have finished with diner Idgie, not knowing what they where laughing at, berates them for acting the way they did when they had company, which only causes everyone to start laughing again.

After this Ninny tells Evelyn that Idgie &amp; Ruth began to spend all there time together, reflecting that they just seemed to take to one another, saying that Ruth felt rather lonely from being so far away from her home &amp; that Idgie always made her laugh. Mrs. Threadgooda said that it was the only time when she could get Idgie to do what she wanted, all she had was have Ruth ask her. She said that if Ruth had asked Idgie would have jumped off a cliff backwords if Ruth had asked her to.

==Analysis==

Idgie's feelings for Ruth are shown throughout this chapter as Ninny tells Evelyn her stories. She is has fallen head over heels for Ruth showig off, looking at her through the window &amp; doing anything Ruth asks of her, even coming to eat with her family for the first time. Also we can see here that Ruth has feelings for Idgie, though she may not fully realise it yet &amp; may be simply be putting them down to friendship. But nevertheless Ruth does care deeply for Idgie, laughing at her jokes, spending all her free time with her.

On September 15, 1924, two weeks after Ruth went home; Idgie takes Julian's car and drives to Valdosta, Georgia. She stops in a grocery store and inquires about Frank Bennett, Ruth's fiance. She tells the clerk she is Ruth's cousin. The clerk tells her Frank is a decent guy and everyone loves Ruth. He asks if she is staying with Ruth and Idgie says she isn't. She tells him she is a representative of a perfume company and is passing through on business. Idgie tells him that the family was worried and she wanted to check Frank out. She asks him not to tell Ruth because she doesn't want Ruth upset. She leaves without finishing her strawberry drink.

== Analysis ==
Idgie is again experiencing loss and loneliness. She misses Ruth and wants to check out the man Ruth will be marrying. She travels all the way to Georgia to make sure he is a good man &amp; that Ruth will be happy, which shows that even though is in no way happy that Ruth is going to be with someone else she does want Ruth to be happy &amp; safe.

An article in The Valdosta Courier announces the wedding of Ruth and Frank. The date is November 2, 1924.

==Analysis==

With this article, the author lets the reader know that Ruth has married Frank. The article reads more like a typical newspaper article than anything written by Dot Weems so far.

In Valdosta, Georgia on November 1, 1924, Idgie sits outside the church. It is the day of Ruth and Frank's wedding. Idgie arrives at seven o'clock and watches the church all day. She sees Ruth and her mother &amp; reflects to herself that Ruth looks as beautful in her wedding gown as she thought she would. Soon after that she sees Frank &amp; his brother enter the chruch &amp; once the chruch is full the doors close &amp; Idgie's heart sicks. When the bride and groom recite their vows, Idgie sits outside and blows the horn, inraged at what is happening but unable to do anything else. Soon after that Ruth &amp; Frank leave the church &amp; drive off to their honeymoon, but just as they are about to turn the corner Idgie blows the horn one last time but Ruth does not look in time &amp; does not see her.

==Analysis==

The theme of love is seen in this chapter. Idgie is in love with Ruth. Time and distance have not changed this. She acts like a person in love when that person has been left behind. She can't let go of Ruth. Ruth is the first person Idgie has loved since her brother's death. Losing the two people she loved most is too much for Idgie to bear. She tries to dull her pain by getting drunk and ends up getting sick on her way home, needing to pull over &amp; throw up on her way home.

This chapter takes place in Valdosta, Georgia on September 30, 1924. Frank Bennett adored his mother and hated his father. This love changed to hate when he came home from school one day to find his mother making love to her brother in law. That memory haunts him for the rest of his life. Frank is a vain man. He gets what he wants, and he wants Ruth. He has been with many loose women. One woman claimed her daughter was his child, but after he beat her up, she never made the claim again. He liked Ruth because she was untouched. Everyone in town thought he was a good guy. The first to see the evil within was an old man at the bar. Frank told him he'd buy the man a drink if he could guess which eye was glass. The old man guesses the left, as it was the only one that had even a glimmer of human compassion.

==Analysis==
This chapter is to show in full detail the character of Frank Bennett &amp; to show why he is the way he is, even though that does not exscues him for what he has done or will do.

On April 6, 1986, Evelyn visits Mrs. Threadgoode. She tells Evelyn that Vesta Adcock has gone crazy. She came in the room, grabbed Mrs. Otis's ceramic slipper and threw it out the window. Mrs. Otis is upset, but a nurse tells her Mrs. Adcock has been doing that to everyone lately. Ninny tells Evelyn she is glad her mind is strong.

==Analysis==
The theme of aging is seen in this chapter. The difference in how Mrs. Threadgoode and Mrs. Adcock have aged is seen. While the behavior of Mrs. Adcock may seem silly, it shows what can happen when the mind deteriorates with age. Mrs. Adcock is much wealthier than Mrs. Threadgoode, but the loss of her mental capacity makes her much poorer than Ninny.

On August 4, 1928, Idgie goes back to Valdosta to check on Ruth. She finds out from the owner at the drugstore that Frank has been beating her. Idgie goes crazy and barges into the barbershop. She threatens Frank and smashes several bottles before speeding out of town. When she arrives back at the Wagon Wheel Fishing Lodge, she tells Eva she will kill him one day and she means it.

==Analysis==
Idgie's love for Ruth is again seen in this chapter. Once she promised Ruth she would kill for her. She still loves Ruth as much as ever and still means what she has said. Eva tries to calm her, but to no avail.

In Valdosta, Georgia on September 18, 1928, Ruth reflects on her marriage. She had returned to marry Frank and tried to put Idgie out of her mind. She would pray to God that he would take the thoughts out of her mind. On their honeymoon Frank had raped &amp; beat her on &amp; she bled for three days and hated sex after that. She feels like he is punishing her with forced sex. She blames herself because she thinks Frank can feel her love for Idgie. She thinks she deserves the abuse. While on her deathbed, Ruth's mother tells her daughter that Frank is the devil and she must leave him. Her mother dies later that day and Ruth sends a page from the Book of Ruth to from the Bible to Idgie.

==Analysis==

The details of Ruth's abusive marriage are seen in this chapter. Ruth mistakenly blames herself for the abuse. She thinks Frank is punishing her with forced sex because he can feel the love she has for Idgie. After her mother died there is no longer anything keeping Ruth from leaving &amp; as her mother makes her promise to leave Frank &amp; reaches out to her true love, Idgie. She knows that Idgie loves her, does not hate her for leaving, will not turn her away &amp; will come to save her from Frank.

On April 27, 1986, Evelyn is again visiting Mrs. Threadgoode. She asks Ninny when Ruth came back to Whistle Stop. Ninny tells her that one day in 1928 or 1929 a letter arrived for Idgie. Mother sent Big George to find Idgie. The letter was a torn bible page from the book of Ruth. Idgie asks her mother what it means and her mother tells her it means Idgie and her brothers need to go to Georgia and get Ruth. The next day, they go get her. Ninny tells Evelyn that Ruth was stronger than Idgie in some ways, even though everyone treated her like a china doll.

Evelyn asks if they ever divorced, but Ninny doesn't know. She does know that Frank came to Whistle Stop once and it was one time too many. He was the one who was murdered.

On September 21, 1928 Idgie, Cleo, Julian, Big George, Wilbur Weems and Billy Limeway go to Valdosta to get Ruth. Ruth is dressed and waiting, but Frank wakes up when he hears the car in the driveway. He storms outside and yells at Idgie. When he sees the men, he demands to know what is going on. Julian tells him Ruth is leaving and warns him to stay away from Big George, whom Julian describes as a crazy nigger. They leave and Frank yells for Ruth to never come back. He tells the neighbors she went crazy after her mother died and he had to have her committed.

==Analysis==
With the help of Idgie and the men, Ruth finally breaks free of her abusive relationship and returns to Idgie. Many women stay far too long in abusive relationships because they feel there is nowhere else to go.

Momma and Poppa Threadgoode are waiting on the porch for Ruth, Idgie and the boys. Poppa tells her not to push Ruth, to let her make up her own mind about staying. When they see how frail she looks, they tell her to stay. She says she will and she never should have left Idgie in the first place. Momma says she is happy Idgie has found such a sweet companion. The next day, she goes back to her maiden name. At first, she is upset when Idgie tells everyone Frank was crushed by an armored truck, but after the baby is born, she is glad.

==Analysis==

The importance of family is the theme of this chapter. The Threadgoode's are family to Ruth and welcome her with open arms. She professes her love for Idgie and says she will stay this time. Idgie tells another of her crazy stories when telling everyone in town that Frank Bennett was killed in a rather graphic way, this is more then likely to make Ruth feel better, which ultimately works.

On November 22, 1930 a group of KKK members line up in front of the cafe. Grady is there and goes out to investigate. They leave, but Ruth notices one of the men staring at her. She recognizes his shoes and becomes afraid. Grady tells the girls the men are from Georgia and won't be back to bother them again. They don't come back, but the man with the shoes does come back alone and late at night. He is Frank Bennett.

==Analysis==
Ruth comes face to face with Frank. He is in his KKK robes, but Ruth recognizes his shoes. Until now, he hasn't known he has a child because she found out she was pregnant after she left. She had escaped her marriage and thought she was rid of Frank, but he reappeared with the Klan. This brings her fear to the surface.

The Valdosta Gazette has a headline that reads, &quot;Local Man Missing.&quot; The date is December 15, 1930. Frank Bennett has been reported missing by his brother. He was last seen leaving or a hunting trip two days before and has not been seen since. Anyone with any information should call the police.

==Analysis==
The reader knows by now that Frank has been murdered. Mrs. Threadgoode has told his murder to Evelyn. This leaves the questions as to his murderer's identity and if it is Idgie, will she be caught, unanswered.

On December 18, 1930, Grady and two officers from Georgia come to the cafe. Grady shows the picture to Big George and Idgie, but they deny knowing Frank. Idgie has Sipsey bring coffee, pie and acts like she doesn't know Frank. When Grady asks where Ruth is, Idgie tells him she is at her parent's house taking care of Idgie's mother, who is ill. They go to the beauty shop now, but Opal has a fit and tells them men are not allowed inside. They leave and Grady tells the other officers that Frank definitely didn't go there.

== Analysis ==
The investigation of Frank's death begins in Whistle Stop. The cover up begins as they all tell the officers they haven't seen Frank Bennett.

On March 19, 1931, the headline in The Weems Weekly reads, &quot;Sad News for All of Us.&quot; Idgie's mother has died. The article mentions that their father passed away the year before. After the service, everyone went over to the Threadgoode house to pay his or her respects. Dot reminisces about the home and that she and Wilbur were dating with Ninny and Cleo. She states that everyone will miss her.

==Analysis==
The theme of death and loss is again seen in this chapter. Mrs. Threadgoode has passed away. Although the article mentions their father's death, it has not been mentioned before now. Idgie has lost her parents and most loved sibling, but has Ruth back.

[[File:Cloud_Gate_Chicago.jpg|250px|thumb|left|An example of a reflecting surface: the “Cloud Gate” sculpture in Chicago.]]

This tutorial introduces '''reflection mapping''' (and '''cube maps''' to implement it).

It's the second in a small series of tutorials about advanced texture mapping techniques; specifically about environment mapping using cube maps in Blender. The tutorial is based on the per-pixel lighting described in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Smooth Specular Highlights|tutorial on smooth specular highlights]] and on the concept of texture mapping, which was introduced in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Textured Spheres|tutorial on textured spheres]].

[[File:Cube mapped reflection example.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A skybox is a (infinitely) large box surrounding the whole scene. Here a reflected camera ray (i.e. view ray) hits one of the textured faces of the skybox.]]
===Reflection Mapping with a Skybox===
The illustration to the left depicts the concept of reflection mapping with a static skybox: a view ray is reflected at a point on the surface of an object and the reflected ray is intersected with the skybox to determine the color of the corresponding pixel. The skybox is just a large cube with textured faces surrounding the whole scene. It should be noted that skyboxes are usually static and don't include any dynamic objects of the scene. However, “skyboxes” for reflection mapping are often rendered to include the scene from a certain point of view. This is, however, beyond the scope of this tutorial. Moreover, this tutorial covers only the computation of the reflection, it doesn't cover the rendering of the skybox. &lt;!--, which is discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Skyboxes|tutorial on skyboxes]]. --&gt;

For the reflection of a skybox in an object, we have to render the object and reflect the rays from the camera to the surface points at the surface normal vectors. The mathematics of this reflection is the same as for the reflection of a light ray at a surface normal vector, which was discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Specular Highlights|tutorial on specular highlights]]. 

Once we have the reflected ray, its intersection with a large skybox has to be computed. This computation actually becomes easier if the skybox is infinitely large: in that case the position of the surface point doesn't matter at all since its distance from the origin of the coordinate system is infinitely small compared to the size of the skybox; thus, only the direction of the reflected ray matters but not its position. Therefore, we can actually also think of a ray that starts in the center of a small skybox instead of a ray that starts somewhere in an infinitely large skybox. (If you are not familiar with this idea, you probably need a bit of time to accept it.) Depending on the direction of the reflected ray, it will intersect one of the six faces of the textured skybox. We could compute, which face is intersected and where the face is intersected and then do a texture lookup (see the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Textured Spheres|tutorial on textures spheres]]) in the texture image for the specific face. However, GLSL offers cube maps, which support exactly this kind of texture lookups in the six faces of a cube using a direction vector. Thus, all we need to do, is to provide a cube map for the environment as a shader property and use the &lt;code&gt;textureCube&lt;/code&gt; instruction with the reflected direction to get the color at the corresponding position in the cube map. 

[[File:Skybox tut13 384x256.png|250px|thumb|left|A Blender cube map. ]]
===Cube Maps===
The image to the left shows a Blender cube map, which is discussed in the wikibook [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Build a skybox|“Blender 3D Noob to Pro”]]. Actually, it is a scaled version of the cube map that is described in the Blender wikibook because the dimensions of faces of cube maps for GLSL shaders have to be powers of two, e.g. 128 × 128. 

In order to use the cube map to the left for the reflection in a sphere, add a UV sphere mesh, give it a material and create a new texture as in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Textured Spheres|tutorial on textures spheres]]. However, in the '''Properties window &gt; Textures tab''' choose '''Type: Environment Map''' and click on '''Environment Map &gt; Image File'''. Then download the image and open it in Blender with the '''Environment Map &gt; Open''' button. (If you select '''Mapping &gt; Coordinates: Reflection''', the '''Preview &gt; Material''' should show the applied reflection map.)

The vertex shader has to compute the view direction &lt;code&gt;viewDirection&lt;/code&gt; and the normal direction &lt;code&gt;normalDirection&lt;/code&gt; in world space. We saw how to compute them in view space in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Specular Highlights|tutorial on specular highlights]]. Therefore, we use this code to go to world space and then back to view space by transforming with the inverse view matrix as discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Shading in View Space|tutorial on shading in view space]]. An additional complication is that the normal vector has to be transformed with the transposed, inverse matrix (see [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Applying Matrix Transformations|“Applying Matrix Transformations”]]). In this case, the inverse matrix is the inverse of the inverse view matrix, which is just the view matrix itself. Thus the vertex shader could be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
         uniform mat4 viewMatrix; // world to view transformation
         uniform mat4 viewMatrixInverse; 
            // view to world transformation

         varying vec3 viewDirection; // direction in world space 
            // in which the viewer is looking
         varying vec3 normalDirection; // normal vector in world space 
         
         void main()
         {
            vec4 positionInViewSpace = gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex;
               // transformation of gl_Vertex from object coordinates 
               // to view coordinates
            vec4 viewDirectionInViewSpace = positionInViewSpace 
               - vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
               // camera is always at (0,0,0,1) in view coordinates;
               // this is the direction in which the viewer is looking 
               // (not the direction to the viewer)
            viewDirection = 
               vec3(viewMatrixInverse * viewDirectionInViewSpace);
               // transformation from view coordinates to 
               // world coordinates
            vec3 normalDirectionInViewSpace = 
               gl_NormalMatrix * gl_Normal;
               // transformation of gl_Normal from object coordinates 
               // to view coordinates
            normalDirection = normalize(vec3(
               vec4(normalDirectionInViewSpace, 0.0) * viewMatrix));
               // transformation of normal vector from view coordinates 
               // to world coordinates with the transposed 
               // (multiplication of the vector from the left) of 
               // the inverse of viewMatrixInverse, which is viewMatrix
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
&lt;/source&gt;

Furthermore, we have to set the uniforms for &lt;code&gt;viewMatrix&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;viewMatrixInverse&lt;/code&gt; in the Python script:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
      viewMatrix = \
          bge.logic.getCurrentScene().active_camera.world_to_camera
      shader.setUniformMatrix4('viewMatrix', viewMatrix)
      viewMatrixInverse = \
          bge.logic.getCurrentScene().active_camera.camera_to_world
      shader.setUniformMatrix4('viewMatrixInverse', viewMatrixInverse)
&lt;/source&gt;

Now to the fragment shader. A cube map is defined similarly to a regular 2D texture in a GLSL shader but with &lt;code&gt;samplerCube&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;sampler2D&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            uniform samplerCube cubeMap;	
&lt;/source&gt; 
The uniform is set in the Python script just like any other texture sampler:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
         shader.setSampler('cubeMap', 0)
&lt;/source&gt;
Where the &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; specifies the position in the list of textures.

To reflect the view direction in the fragment shader, we can use the GLSL function &lt;code&gt;reflect&lt;/code&gt; as discussed in the [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Blender/Specular Highlights|tutorial on specular highlights]]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            vec3 reflectedDirection = 
               reflect(viewDirection, normalize(normalDirection));
&lt;/source&gt;
And to perform the texture lookup in the cube map and store the resulting color in the fragment color, we would usually simply use:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
             gl_FragColor = textureCube(cubeMap, reflectedDirection);
&lt;/source&gt;
However, Blender appears to reshuffle the cube faces; thus, we have to adapt the coordinates of &lt;code&gt;reflectedDirection&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;GLSL&quot;&gt;
            gl_FragColor = textureCube(cubeMap, 
               vec3(reflectedDirection.x, -reflectedDirection.z, 
               reflectedDirection.y));
&lt;/source&gt;
This produces a reflection that is consistent with the material preview.

===Complete Shader Code===
The shader code then becomes:
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
import bge

cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()

VertexShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
         uniform mat4 viewMatrix; // world to view transformation
         uniform mat4 viewMatrixInverse; 
            // view to world transformation

         varying vec3 viewDirection; // direction in world space 
            // in which the viewer is looking
         varying vec3 normalDirection; // normal vector in world space 
        
         void main()
         {
            vec4 positionInViewSpace = gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex;
               // transformation of gl_Vertex from object coordinates 
               // to view coordinates

            vec4 viewDirectionInViewSpace = positionInViewSpace 
               - vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
               // camera is always at (0,0,0,1) in view coordinates;
               // this is the direction in which the viewer is looking 
               // (not the direction to the viewer)
            
            viewDirection = 
               vec3(viewMatrixInverse * viewDirectionInViewSpace);
               // transformation from view coordinates 
               // to world coordinates
               
            vec3 normalDirectionInViewSpace = 
               gl_NormalMatrix * gl_Normal;
               // transformation of gl_Normal from object coordinates 
               // to view coordinates

            normalDirection = normalize(vec3(
               vec4(normalDirectionInViewSpace, 0.0) * viewMatrix));
               // transformation of normal vector from view coordinates 
               // to world coordinates with the transposed 
               // (multiplication of the vector from the left) of 
               // the inverse of viewMatrixInverse, which is viewMatrix
            
            gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
         }
&quot;&quot;&quot;

FragmentShader = &quot;&quot;&quot;
         varying vec3 viewDirection;
         varying vec3 normalDirection;
         uniform samplerCube cubeMap;

         void main()
         {
            vec3 reflectedDirection = reflect(viewDirection, 
               normalize(normalDirection));

            gl_FragColor = textureCube(cubeMap, 
               vec3(reflectedDirection.x, -reflectedDirection.z, 
               reflectedDirection.y));
               // usually this would be: gl_FragColor = 
               // textureCube(cubeMap, reflectedDirection);
               // however, Blender appears to reshuffle the faces a bit
         }
&quot;&quot;&quot;

mesh = cont.owner.meshes[0]
for mat in mesh.materials:
    shader = mat.getShader()
    if shader != None:
        if not shader.isValid():
            shader.setSource(VertexShader, FragmentShader, 1)
            shader.setSampler('cubeMap', 0)
        viewMatrix = \
            bge.logic.getCurrentScene().active_camera.world_to_camera
        shader.setUniformMatrix4('viewMatrix', viewMatrix)
        viewMatrixInverse = \
            bge.logic.getCurrentScene().active_camera.camera_to_world
        shader.setUniformMatrix4('viewMatrixInverse', \ 
            viewMatrixInverse)
&lt;/source&gt;

      <comment>/* Creating a texture OpenGL buffer */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Loading a texture =

[[File:OpenGL_Tutorial_Texture.jpg|thumb|Our texture, in 2D]]

To load a texture, we need code to load images in a particular format, like JPEG or PNG.
Usually, your final program will use generic libraries such as SDL_Image, SFML or Irrlicht, that support various image formats, so you won't have to write your own image-loading code.  Specialized libraries such as SOIL (see below) may interest you as well.

In a first step, we need to manipulate the image at a low level to understand the basics, so we'll use a trick : GIMP can export an image as C source code, that we can read as-is from our program!  I used the save options in the GIMp screenshot on the right.
[[File:OpenGL_Tutorial_Gimp_export_as_C.png|thumb|Exporting image as C from GIMP]]

If there's demand, we may provide a special tutorial to read a simple format like PNM, or a subset of BMP or TGA (these two are also simple, but support compression and various formats so it's hard to support all their options).

Note: Bundling images as C code is not super-memory-efficient, so don't generalize it.
Technically: it's stored in the program BSS segment rather than in the heap, so it cannot be freed.

Note 2: you can find the GIMP source as res_texture.xcf in the code repository.

To automatically rebuild the application when you modify res_texture.c, add this to the Makefile:
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
cube.o: res_texture.c
&lt;/source&gt;

= Creating a texture OpenGL buffer =

The buffer is basically a memory slot inside the graphic card, so OpenGL can access it very quickly.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* Globals */
GLuint texture_id, program_id;
GLint uniform_mytexture;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* init_resources */
  glGenTextures(1, &amp;texture_id);
  glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture_id);
  glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
  glTexImage2D(
    GL_TEXTURE_2D,         // target
    0,                     // level, 0 = base, no minimap,
    GL_RGB,                // internalformat
    res_texture.width,     // width
    res_texture.height,    // height
    0,                     // border, always 0 in OpenGL ES
    GL_RGB,                // format
    GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,      // type
    res_texture.pixel_data
  );
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* render */
  glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
  glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture_id);
  uniform_mytexture = glGetUniformLocation(program_id, &quot;mytexture&quot;);
  glUniform1i(uniform_mytexture, /*GL_TEXTURE*/0);
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* free_resources */
  glDeleteTextures(1, &amp;texture_id);
&lt;/source&gt;

= Texture coordinates =

We now need to say where each vertex is located on our texture.
For this, we'll replace the &lt;code&gt;v_color&lt;/code&gt; attribute to the vertex shader with a &lt;code&gt;texcoord&lt;/code&gt;:

 GLint attribute_coord3d, attribute_v_color''', attribute_texcoord''';

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* init_resources */
  attribute_name = &quot;texcoord&quot;;
  attribute_texcoord = glGetAttribLocation(program, attribute_name);
  if (attribute_texcoord == -1) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Could not bind attribute %s\n&quot;, attribute_name);
    return 0;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, what part of our texture do we map to, say, the top-left corner of the front face?  Well, it depends:
* for the front face: the top-left corner of our texture
* for the top face: the bottom-left corner of our texture
We see that multiple texture points will be attached to the same vertex. The vertex shader won't be able to decide which one to pick.

So we need rewrite the cube by using 4 vertices per face, no reused vertices.

For a start though, we'll just work on the front face.  Easy! We just have to only display the 2 first triangles (6 first vertices):
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, 6, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;

So, our texture coordinates are in the [0, 1] range, with x axis from left to right, and y axis from bottom to top:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* init_resources */
  GLfloat cube_texcoords[] = {
    // front
    0.0, 0.0,
    1.0, 0.0,
    1.0, 1.0,
    0.0, 1.0,
  };
  glGenBuffers(1, &amp;vbo_cube_texcoords);
  glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo_cube_texcoords);
  glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(cube_texcoords), cube_texcoords, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  /* onDisplay */
  glEnableVertexAttribArray(attribute_texcoord);
  glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo_cube_texcoords);
  glVertexAttribPointer(
    attribute_texcoord, // attribute
    2,                  // number of elements per vertex, here (x,y)
    GL_FLOAT,           // the type of each element
    GL_FALSE,           // take our values as-is
    0,                  // no extra data between each position
    0                   // offset of first element
  );
&lt;/source&gt;

Vertex shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
attribute vec3 coord3d;
attribute vec2 texcoord;
varying vec2 f_texcoord;
uniform mat4 mvp;

void main(void) {
  gl_Position = mvp * vec4(coord3d, 1.0);
  f_texcoord = texcoord;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Fragment shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
varying vec2 f_texcoord;
uniform sampler2D mytexture;

void main(void) {
  gl_FragColor = texture2D(mytexture, f_texcoord);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:OpenGL_Tutorial_Texture_Flipped.png|thumb|Something is wrong...]]
But what happens?  Our texture is upside-down!

The OpenGL convention (origin at the bottom-left corner) is different than in 2D applications (origin at the top-left corner).
To fix this we can either:
* read the pixels lines from bottom to top
* swap the pixel lines
* swap the texture Y coordinates

Most graphics libraries return a pixels array in the 2D convention.  However, [http://openil.sourceforge.net/tuts/tut_10/index.htm DevIL] has an option to position the origin and avoid this issue.  Alternatively, some formats such as BMP and TGA store pixel lines from bottom to top natively (which may explain a certain popularity of the otherwise heavy TGA format among 3D developers), useful if you write a custom loader for them.

Swapping the pixel lines can be done in the C code at run time, too.  If you program in high-level languages such as Python this can even be done in one line.  The drawback is that texture loading will be somewhat slower because of this extra step.

Reversing the texture coordinates is the easiest way for us, we can do that in the fragment shader:
&lt;source lang=&quot;glsl&quot;&gt;
void main(void) {
  vec2 flipped_texcoord = vec2(f_texcoord.x, 1.0 - f_texcoord.y);
  gl_FragColor = texture2D(mytexture, flipped_texcoord);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

OK, technically we could have written the texture coordinates in the other direction in the first place - but other 3D applications tend to work the way we describe.

= Bumping to a full cube =

So as we discussed, we specify independent vertices for each faces:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  GLfloat cube_vertices[] = {
    // front
    -1.0, -1.0,  1.0,
     1.0, -1.0,  1.0,
     1.0,  1.0,  1.0,
    -1.0,  1.0,  1.0,
    // top
    -1.0,  1.0,  1.0,
     1.0,  1.0,  1.0,
     1.0,  1.0, -1.0,
    -1.0,  1.0, -1.0,
    // back
     1.0, -1.0, -1.0,
    -1.0, -1.0, -1.0,
    -1.0,  1.0, -1.0,
     1.0,  1.0, -1.0,
    // bottom
    -1.0, -1.0, -1.0,
     1.0, -1.0, -1.0,
     1.0, -1.0,  1.0,
    -1.0, -1.0,  1.0,
    // left
    -1.0, -1.0, -1.0,
    -1.0, -1.0,  1.0,
    -1.0,  1.0,  1.0,
    -1.0,  1.0, -1.0,
    // right
     1.0, -1.0,  1.0,
     1.0, -1.0, -1.0,
     1.0,  1.0, -1.0,
     1.0,  1.0,  1.0,
  };
&lt;/source&gt;

For each face, vertices are added counter-clockwise (when the viewer is facing that face).
Consequently, the texture mapping will be identical for all faces:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  GLfloat cube_texcoords[2*4*6] = {
    // front
    0.0, 0.0,
    1.0, 0.0,
    1.0, 1.0,
    0.0, 1.0,
  };
  for (int i = 1; i &lt; 6; i++)
    memcpy(&amp;cube_texcoords[i*4*2], &amp;cube_texcoords[0], 2*4*sizeof(GLfloat));
&lt;/source&gt;
Here we specified the mapping for the front face, and copied it on all remaining 5 faces.

If a face were clockwise instead of counter-clockwise, then the texture would be shown mirrored.
There's no convention on the orientation, you just have to make sure that the texture coordinates are properly mapped to the vertices.

The cube elements are also written similarly, with 2 triangle with indices (x, x+1, x+2), (x+2, x+3, x):
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  GLushort cube_elements[] = {
    // front
     0,  1,  2,
     2,  3,  0,
    // top
     4,  5,  6,
     6,  7,  4,
    // back
     8,  9, 10,
    10, 11,  8,
    // bottom
    12, 13, 14,
    14, 15, 12,
    // left
    16, 17, 18,
    18, 19, 16,
    // right
    20, 21, 22,
    22, 23, 20,
  };
  ...
  glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, ibo_cube_elements);
  int size;  glGetBufferParameteriv(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, GL_BUFFER_SIZE, &amp;size);
  glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, size/sizeof(GLushort), GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;


[[File:OpenGL_Tutorial_Cube_textured.png|thumb|Fly, cube, fly!]]
For additional fun, and to check the bottom face, let's implement the 3-rotations movement showcased in NeHe's flying cube tutorial, in &lt;code&gt;onIdle&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  float angle = glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME) / 1000.0 * 15;  // base 15° per second
  glm::mat4 anim = \
    glm::rotate(glm::mat4(1.0f), angle*3.0f, glm::vec3(1, 0, 0)) *  // X axis
    glm::rotate(glm::mat4(1.0f), angle*2.0f, glm::vec3(0, 1, 0)) *  // Y axis
    glm::rotate(glm::mat4(1.0f), angle*4.0f, glm::vec3(0, 0, 1));   // Z axis
&lt;/source&gt;

We're done!

= Using SOIL =

WIP

SOIL provides a way to load an image file in PNG, JPG and a few other formats, designed for OpenGL integration.
It's a pretty minimal library with no dependency.  It's used under the hood by SFML (although SFML also uses libjpeg and libpng directly).

Install it (look for a package named &lt;tt&gt;libsoil&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;libsoil-dev&lt;/tt&gt;, or something similar).

Reference it in your Makefile:
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
LDLIBS=-lglut -lSOIL -lGLEW -lGL -lm
&lt;/source&gt;

Include the soil header:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;SOIL/SOIL.h&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

One high-level function allows you to upload it directly to the OpenGL context:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
  GLuint texture_id = SOIL_load_OGL_texture
    (
     &quot;res_texture.png&quot;,
     SOIL_LOAD_AUTO,
     SOIL_CREATE_NEW_ID,
     SOIL_FLAG_INVERT_Y
     );
  if(texture_id == 0)
    cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;SOIL loading error: '&quot; &lt;&lt; SOIL_last_result() &lt;&lt; &quot;' (&quot; &lt;&lt; &quot;res_texture.png&quot; &lt;&lt; &quot;)&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
&lt;/source&gt;

* &lt;code&gt;SOIL_FLAG_INVERT_Y&lt;/code&gt; deals with the reverse-Y-coordinates issue we experienced above.
* SOIL also adapt NPOT (non power of 2) textures, when the graphic card doesn't handle these directly

Note that with this method, you do not have access to the image dimensions. To get them, you need to use a lower-level API:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  int img_width, img_height;
  unsigned char* img = SOIL_load_image(&quot;res_texture.png&quot;, &amp;img_width, &amp;img_height, NULL, 0);

  glGenTextures(1, &amp;texture_id);
  glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture_id);
  glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR);
  glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGB, img_width, img_height, 0, GL_RGB, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, img);
  
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Pathlines and Streamlines ===
The path which a fluid element traces out in space is called a ''pathline''. For steady non-fluctuating flows where a pathline is followed continuously by a number of fluid elements , the pathline is called ''streamline''. A ''streamline'' is the imaginary line whose tangent gives the velocity of flow at all times if the flow is steady, however in an unsteady flow, the streamline is constantly changing and thus the tangent gives the velocity of an element at an instant of time.
A common practice in analysis is taking some of the walls of a control volume to be along streamlines.
Since there is no flow perpendicular to streamlines, only the flow across the other boundaries need be considered.

== Hydrostatics ==
The pressure distribution in a fluid under gravity is given by the relation ''dp/dz = &amp;minus;&amp;rho;g'' where ''dz'' is the change in the direction of the gravitational field (usually in the vertical direction).
Note that it is quite straightforward to get the relations for arbitrary fields too, for instance, the pseudo field due to rotation.

The pressure in a fluid acts equally in all directions.
When it comes in contact with a surface, the force due to pressure acts normal to the surface.
The force on a small area ''dA'' is given by ''p dA'' where the force is in the direction normal to ''dA''.
The total force on the area ''A'' is given by the vector sum of all these infinitesimal forces.

== Control Volume Analysis ==
A fluid dynamic system can be analysed using a ''control volume'', which is an imaginary surface enclosing a volume of interest.
The control volume can be fixed or moving, and it can be rigid or deformable.
Thus, we will have to write the most general case of the laws of mechanics to deal with control volumes.

The first equation we can write is the conservation of mass over time.
Consider a system where mass flow is given by ''dm/dt'', where ''m'' is the mass of the system.
We have, 

&lt;math&gt;
  \dot m = \int_{CS} \rho
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right) dA
&lt;/math&gt;

For steady flow, we have 

&lt;math&gt;
  \int_{CS} \rho
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right) dA = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

And for incompressible flow, we have

&lt;math&gt;
  \int_{CS}
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right) dA = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

If we consider flow through a tube, we have, for steady flow,

&lt;math&gt;
  \rho_1A_1V_1 = \rho_2A_2V_2
&lt;/math&gt;

and for incompressible steady flow,  ''A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Law of conservation of momentum as applied to a control volume states that

&lt;math&gt;
  \sum F = \frac{d}{dt}
  \left(
    \int_{CV} \mathbf{V} \mathbf{\rho}
  \right) + \int_{CS} \mathbf{V}\mathbf{\rho}
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right)dA
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is the velocity vector and ''n'' is the unit vector normal to the control surface at that point.

Law of Conservation of Energy (First Law of Thermodynamics)

&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{d\mathbf{Q}}{dt} + \frac{d\mathbf{W}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}
  \left(
    \int_{CV} e\mathbf{\rho}
  \right) + \int_{CS} e\mathbf{\rho}
  \left(
    \mathbf{V}\cdot\mathbf{n}
  \right)dA
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''e'' is the energy per unit mass.

=== Bernoulli's Equation ===
''Bernoulli's equation'' considers frictionless flow along a streamline.

For steady, incompressible flow along a streamline, we have

&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{p}{\rho} + \frac{V^2}{2} + gz = constant
&lt;/math&gt;

We see that Bernoulli's equation is just the law of conservation of energy without the heat transfer and work.

It may seem that Bernoulli's equation can only be applied in a very limited set of situations, as it requires ideal conditions.
However, since the equation applies to streamlines, we can consider a streamline near the area of interest where it is satisfied, and it might still give good results, ''i.e.'', you don't need a control volume for the actual analysis (although one is used in the derivation of the equation).

==== Energy in terms of Head ====
Bernoulli's equation can be recast as

&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{p}{\rho g} + \frac{V^2}{2g} + z = constant
&lt;/math&gt;

This constant can be called head of the water, and is a representation of the amount of work that can be extracted from it.
For example, for water in a dam, at the inlet of the penstock, the pressure is high, but the velocity is low, while at the outlet, the pressure is low (atmospheric) while the velocity is high.
The value of head calculated above remains constant (ignoring frictional losses).

==== Mechanical Energy Balance Equation ====
Yet another variation of the Bernoulli's equation is the mechanical energy balance equation. The mechanical energy balance equation is useful when needing to consider things such as work or losses due to friction, or if there are differences between the outlet and inlet (such as pressure, velocity, and height).

&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\Delta p}{\rho} + \frac{\Delta (V^2)}{2} + g\Delta z + f = -w
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In addition to the properties like mass, velocity, and pressure usually considered in physical problems, the following are the basic properties of a fluid:
=== Density ===
The density of a fluid, is generally designated by the Greek symbol &lt;math&gt; \rho  (rho)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the mass of the fluid over an infinitesimal volume. Density is expressed in the British Gravitational (BG) system as slugs/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and in the SI system kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; \rho = \lim_{\Delta V\rightarrow 0} \frac {\Delta m}{\Delta V }\, = \frac {dm}{dV}&lt;/math&gt;

If the fluid is assumed to be uniformly dense the formula may be simplified as:

&lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac {{m}}{{V}} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Specific Weight ===
The specific weight of a fluid is designated by the Greek symbol &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; (gamma), and is generally defined as the weight per unit volume. The units for gamma are lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and N/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in the imperial and SI systems, respectively.

&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \rho &lt;/math&gt; * ''g''

''g'' = local acceleration of gravity and 
&lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; = density

''Note:''
It is customary to use:

''g'' = 32.174&amp;nbsp;ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9.81&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt;= 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Relative Density (Specific Gravity) ===
The relative density of any fluid is defined as the ratio of the density of that fluid to the density of the standard fluid. For liquids we take water as a standard fluid with density ρ=1000 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. For gases we take air or O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a standard fluid with density, ρ=1.293 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Viscosity ===
Viscosity (represented by &amp;mu;, Greek letter mu) is a material property, unique to fluids, that measures the fluid's resistance to flow. Though a property of the fluid, its effect is understood only when the fluid is in motion. When different elements move with different velocities, each element tries to drag its neighbouring elements along with it. Thus, shear stress occurs between fluid elements of different velocities. 
[[Image:Laminar_shear_flow.png‎|frame|center|Velocity gradient in laminar shear flow]]
The relationship between the shear stress and the velocity field was studied by Isaac Newton and he proposed that the shear stresses are directly proportional to the velocity gradient. 
&lt;math&gt;\tau = \mu \frac{\partial u} {\partial y}&lt;/math&gt;
The constant of proportionality is called the coefficient of dynamic viscosity.

Another coefficient, known as the kinematic viscosity (&lt;math&gt; \nu  &lt;/math&gt;, Greek nu) is defined as the ratio of dynamic viscosity and density.

I.e., &lt;math&gt; \nu = \mu / \rho &lt;/math&gt;

It is the property of a fluid that quantifies resistance to flow of the fluid.

==Dimensionless parameters==
Dimensionless parameters are used to simplify analysis, and describe the physical situation without referring to units. A dimensionless quantity has no physical unit associated with it. They arose from dimensional analysis techniques. These numbers have many applications in fluid mechanics as well as in related subjects like aerodynamics and convective heat transfer. 

=== Reynolds Number ===
Reynolds number (after Osborne Reynolds, 1842-1912) is used in the study of fluid flows. It compares the relative strength of inertial and viscous effects.

The value of the Reynolds number is defined as:
&lt;math&gt;
  Re = \frac{\rho V L}{\mu} = \frac{VL}{\nu}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&amp;rho;''(rho) is the density, ''&amp;mu;''(mu) is the absolute viscosity, ''V'' is the characteristic velocity of the flow, and ''L'' is the characteristic length for the flow.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;6&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|- style=&quot;background:#235e2d;font-weight:bold; color:white; &quot; 
|width=&quot;640&quot;|Example 0.1: Reynold's number for flat plate flow
|-style=&quot;background:#deeede;&quot;
|Air at 293K temperature, and 1.225 kg m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; density is flowing past a flat plate at 1 m s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. What's the Reynold's Number 1 m downstream from the leading the edge of the plate?
|-style=&quot;background:#f5fff5;&quot;
| Absolute viscosity for air is 1.8 × 10-5 N s m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;
  Re = \frac{\rho V L}{\mu} = \frac{ 1.225   (1)   (1)}{1.8E10^{-5}}
     = 68,055
&lt;/math&gt; 
|}

Additionally, we define a parameter ''&amp;nu;''(nu) as the ''kinematic viscosity''.

Low ''Re'' indicates creeping flow, medium ''Re'' is ''laminar'' flow, and high ''Re'' indicates ''turbulent'' flow.

Reynolds number can also be transformed to take account of different flow conditions. For example the Reynolds number for flow within a pipe is expressed as

&lt;math&gt;
Re=\frac{\rho u d}{\mu}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''u'' is the average fluid velocity within the pipe and ''d'' is the inside diameter of the pipe.

Application of dynamic forces (and the Reynolds number) to the real world: sky-diving, where friction forces equal the falling body's weight. (jjam)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Knowing how to prepare your campsite for fire is a very important part of fire prevention. 
Simply creating a fire ring from rocks and clearing away ground cover (like dry brush) are both a great start. If you have more resources and time, consider digging a hole in the fire ring as this will shield the fire from wind and prevent fire spread. Speaking of wind, do not create a fire when there is more than a light wind. Always take note of your wind situation (direction and speed). Heavy winds are an extreme fire hazard. 

Locate the fire in your campsite: 
* In your direct eye sight, so you can keep a watch on the fire.
* Where the wind is least likely to send smoke your way.
* Away from camping equipment that might catch fire.
* If possible, near a water source. This way you are prepared to put out the fire when you leave.

{{TOC right}}
The simplest and well proven strategy to get oneself out of trouble, is to announce to people that depend on you (coworkers, your boss, family, landlord, etc) where you are going and for how long. In the event that something happens, there will be a chance that someone will start questioning what happened to you as soon as the delay is detected, since they will not only have a vested interest on your wellbeing and safe return, but also in remembering the details of what you told them.

Leaving behind copy of any plans made for the trip and a list of people that will be participating in the event and their contacts will also increase the chances of a successful rescue. Even if one gets into trouble outside of where one had planed to be, there will be some benefit in the knowledge where any rescue efforts will first be deployed, this may help or not, but will permit to make better choices regarding the situation.

[[Image:Camping and Survival Gear.PNG|right|noframe|444px]]
Keep in mind that the weather can change suddenly though. Just because it is warm when you begin your outing does not mean it will be warm the whole time. If there is a chance that the weather will turn cold, take along some cold weather gear as well.  Check an almanac to see how cold it can get during the time you are planning to be out.

As we have covered planing what to pack and predicting what will need is a basic to ensure that you will be able to not only enjoy your projected outing but offers a greater chance of success in the face the unpredictable. 

=== Clothing ===
'''Warm Weather Clothing'''&lt;br&gt;
Here is a list of clothing appropriate for a warm-weather outing, with extra's included just in case the weather turn's nasty, which you should never underestimate the chance of happening, anytime!  
* Thick socks
* Shorts
* Polypropylene long-johns/woolen trousers, NEVER JEANS, remember cotton kills 
* Polypropylene long sleeve top
* Light Shirt (short sleeve)
* Wind Stopper
* Hat with a wide brim
* Woolen hat, just in case
* Sturdy boots
* Rain Jacket, just in case
* Sunscreen (not technically clothing but essential)

'''Cold Weather Clothing'''&lt;br&gt;
Remember to dress in layers. This will allow you to control your temperature better. When dressing in layers put lightest layers closes to you. this will make them easier to remove without losing a lot of heat. 

In cold weather, you do not want to sweat, because that will soak your clothing and chill you.  If you find yourself working up a sweat, remove a layer of clothing, or open a zipper.  

Rely on wool or polypropylene rather than on cotton as these stay warm even when wet. There is a popular saying among experienced outdoorsmen that &quot;Cotton kills.&quot;  This is because when cotton gets wet, it steals the body's heat which can lead to hypothermia and death.  Your outer layer should be wind-proof, as this greatly increases the warmth of your clothing. This includes:
* Thermal Underwear
* Light shirts 
* Heavy Shirts
* Wool Sweater
* Wind Breaker
* Fleece Pants 
* Nylon Pants or snow pants
* Overcoat
* Wool Socks
* Boots
* Warm Hat

'''Sleepwear'''&lt;br&gt;
For comfortable sleeping and for modesty on overnight trips, bring pajamas or a sweat suit.  In many places where it is warm during the day it gets cold at night, so be prepared.

=== Miscellaneous Gear ===
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Foil blanket.jpg|Foil Blanket
&lt;/gallery&gt;
'''Foil Blanket'''
A emergency foil blanket (also known as a Space blanket, Mylar blanket, first aid blanket, thermal blanket or weather blanket) is a blanket used in emergencies to reduce heat losses in a person's body caused by thermal radiation, water evaporation and convection. This is a very low-cost, light-weight and compact addition to your kit. It has so many uses besides exposure prevention, in the rain it could be used to repel water or used for clean water collection.  Also makes for a big signaling device.

== Dealing with extreme temperatures ==
=== Cold ===
Extreme cold snaps are hazardous to humans and their livestock.  In a [[w:2003|2003]] Mongolian cold snap, almost 30,000 livestock animals perished due to excessive snow and cold.  When the temperature drops, caloric intake must increase to maintain body heat to for shivering [http://www.naturalstrength.com/nutrition/detail.asp?ArticleID=1168].  Cold, especially in combination with other inclement weather is especially deadly [http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/ccc/cc012203.html].

{{TODO|Avoid wind, water and direct contact with heat sapping surfaces (rock, ice). Oil/Grease as a barrier for cold.}}

=== Heat ===
A heat wave is a disaster characterized by [[w:heat|heat]] which is considered extreme and unusual in the area in which it occurs. Heat waves are rare and require specific combinations of [[w:weather|weather]] events to take place, and may include [[w:temperature inversion|temperature inversion]]s, [[w:katabatic winds|katabatic winds]], or other phenomena. The worst heat wave in recent history was the [[w:European Heat Wave of 2003|European Heat Wave of 2003]].

== Avalanches, mudslides and landslides ==
;'''Avalanche''' 
An [[w:avalanche|avalanche]] is a slippage of built-up snow down an incline, possibly mixed with ice, rock, soil or plant life in what is called a debris avalanche.  Avalanches are categorized as either a slab or powder avalanche.  Avalanches are a major danger in the mountains during the winter as a large one can run for miles, and can create massive destruction of the lower forest and anything else in its path.  For example, in [[w:Montroc, France|Montroc, France]], in [[w:1999|1999]] 300,000 cubic meters of snow slid on a 30 degree slope, achieving a speed of 100 km/h. It killed 12 people in their chalets under 100,000 tons of snow, 5 meters deep.  The Mayor of [[w:Chamonix|Chamonix]] was charged with manslaughter. (See http://www.pistehors.com/articles/avalanche/montroc.htm).

{{TODO|Possibly mine and add link to {{PDFlink|[http://fsavalanche.com/NAC/techPages/articles/08_ISSW_AvSurvivalStrat.pdf Avalanche survival strategies for different parts of a flowing avalanche]}}}}

;'''Mudslide'''
A mudslide is a slippage of mud because of poor drainage of [[w:rainfall|rainfall]] through soil.  An underlying cause is often deforestation or lack of vegetation.  Some mudslides are massive and can decimate large areas.  On January 10, 2005 at 1:20pm in [[w:La Conchita|La Conchita]], a massive mudslide buried four blocks of the town in over 30 feet of earth. Ten people were killed by the slide and 14 were injured. Of the 166 homes in the community, fifteen were destroyed and 16 more were tagged by the county as uninhabitable.

;'''Landslide'''
A landslide is a disaster closely related to an [[w:avalanche|avalanche]], but instead of occurring with [[w:snow|snow]], it occurs involving actual elements of the ground, including rocks, [[w:tree|tree]]s, parts of houses, and anything else which may happen to be swept up. Landslides can be caused by [[w:earthquake|earthquake]]s, [[w:volcanic eruption|volcanic eruption]]s, or general instability in the surrounding land. Mudslides, or mud flows, are a special case of landslides, in which heavy rainfall causes loose soil on steep terrain to collapse and slide downwards (see also [[w:Lahar|Lahar]]); these occur with some regularity in parts of [[w:California|California]] after periods of heavy rain.

==Sink hole==
A localized depression in the surface topography, usually caused by the collapse of a subterranean structure, such as a [[w:cave|cave]]. Although rare, large sinkholes that develop suddenly in populated areas can lead to the collapse of buildings and other structures.

==Civil disorder==
Civil disorder is a broad term that is typically used by law enforcement to describe one or more forms of disturbance. Examples of disastrous civil disorder include, but are not necessarily limited to: riots; sabotage; and other forms of crime. Although civil disorder does not necessarily escalate to a disaster in all cases the event may escalate into general chaos.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

==Power outage==
A power outage is not immediately a disaster, however, an extended power outage can strain a community and cause sufficient hardship to cause deaths in a community.  A power outage may also jeopardize company's ability to stay solvent by preventing normal business activities. For this reason, business continuity planning normally addresses the possibility of an outage on the organizations core functions. A power outage at the same time as another disaster may exacerbate the severity of the incident by hampering disaster response teams.

==Radiation Contamination==
Related article: [[w:Chernobyl accident|Chernobyl accident]]&lt;br&gt;
Related article: [[w:Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]

When nuclear weapons are detonated or nuclear containment systems are otherwise compromised, airborne radioactive particles ([[w:Nuclear fallout|fallout]]) can scatter and irradiate large areas. Ionizing radiation is hazardous to living things, and in such a case much of the affected area could be unsafe for human habitation. The former Soviet republic of Belarus was part of a scenario like this in 1986 after a reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant suffered a [[w:Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]].

== Crash (plane or other fast moving vehicle) ==
{{TODO|[[w:Brace position]]}}

== Shipwreck ==
A shipwreck is what remains of a ship that has wrecked, either sunk or beached. Whatever the cause, a sunken ship or a wrecked ship is a physical example of the event: this explains why the two concepts are often overlapping in English

Related article: [[w:USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS Indianapolis (CA-35)]] (~800 dead)

==Telecommunication outage==
A telecommunications outage is not immediately a disaster, however, an extended telecommunications outage can strain a company's ability to stay solvent by cutting them off from their clients, vendors and business partners.  For this reason, [[w:business continuity planning|business continuity planning]] normally addresses the possibility of an outage on the organization's core functions.  A telecommunication outage at the same time as another disaster may exacerbate the severity of the incident by hampering disaster response teams.

Managing your scarce resources, that are not limited to food or water, is a prioritizing task. What can you spare, what will last longer and what can be replaced, substituted or traded. All this will depend on the emergency situation you find yourself in, and what resources you got or can forage for. 

=== What to eat first ===

If the electricity is gone, or you can't rely on it, your fridges and freezers aren't going to be working. It'll keep the food cold for a day or two though, depending on the outside temperature and how often you open the doors. So, eat this stuff, and any other soon-to-go-off food, like cream cakes or whatever, first. Leave tinned and dried food till as late as possible.

=== Food and water rationing ===

The requirement for water varies dramatically, depending on temperature, age and workload. 2 Litres per day is usually reccomended as the minimum amount, but this can be more in hot weather or with a high workload, and people have been known to survive on a lot less.

Likewise, you can probably survive three or more weeks without food, but after three days you'll feel sick and tired. People's calorific requirements vary, so some people can do a day's work fine on 1000 calories or less, but other people will find it impossible to live on less than 2000 calories even if they're not doing anything.

=== Caching  ===
Be careful not to show off your vast stockpiles of food, warm clothing, toilet paper etc. Otherwise people will either begin congregating and asking to share your resources. Or they might come round in the night with guns and sticks and not be so polite in obtaining what they want.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cytoskeleton ==

[[File:FluorescentCells.jpg|thumb|400px|The eukaryotic cytoskeleton. Actin filaments are shown in red, microtubules in green, and the nuclei are in blue.]]Cytoskeleton is the skeleton of the cell, constructed from proteins. They lie on cytoplasm, defining cell's shape, movement and many other functions. There are 3 types of them which we will discuss shortly.

== Actin filaments ==

[[File:MEF_microfilaments.jpg|thumb|400px|Actin cytoskeleton of mouse embryo fibroblasts, stained with Fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin]] Actin filaments are strings anchored one end in the plasma membrane. They generates contractile forces, which helps the cell moves and changes shape. 

Actin filaments are also called microfilaments because they are the thinnest in cytoskeleton family.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Intermediate Filaments ==

Intermediate Filaments are the thickest in cytoskeleton family. Unlike microfilaments, they don't anchor to the plasma membrane. They move in the cytoplasm around the nucleus. Because they are the thickest, they serve an important role in the stability of the cell's shape, forming hair, skin, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Microtubules == 

[[File:Btub.jpg|thumb| 400px|Microtubules in a gel fixated cell]]Microtubules as the name suggests is derived from two words- '''Micro''' means Small and '''Tubules''' means tube like. Microtubules comes under the class of organelles known as Cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletons are the frameworks of the Cell, that form the structural supporting components. Besides these they have other works like Cell movements, muscle contractions and in Cell division. Cytoskeletons are of three types viz, Microtubules, Intermediate filaments and Microfilaments. Microtubules are larger than the other two. Microtubules are composed of tubulin proteins. Tubulin are proteins that form the components of microtubules. The two main types of tubulins  are Alpha and Beta tubulins. They form dimers. Microtubules are polymerized and depolymerized according to the cell's physiological  status. They are strings radiating from points near the nucleus, called centrosomes. When the cell goes into mitosis (which means it's going to divide), these filaments separate into 2 groups, each one carries an equal number of condensed DNAs to each side of the cell. Therefore, each daughter cell has an equal number of DNAs. The number of DNAs is unique for each species.

::Default second parameter: &quot;to prevent impersonation by vandals.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;That is, after all, the default justification for creating a Doppelgänger.

This template is for these &quot;Doppelganger&quot; accounts, created by '''legitimate''' users to '''avoid being impersonated''' by vandals.  Many users have been impersonated by imposters such as the &quot;Doppelganger&quot; vandal. The vandals use various tricks to create an account name which appears identical to the impersonated user's account name. Often, this takes the form of replacing capital &quot;I's&quot; with lowercase &quot;L's&quot; and visa versa.

In order to use this template, insert the template text on your '''&quot;Doppelganger&quot; account's user page &amp; talk page'''. It is suggested you place the template from your &quot;real&quot; account, rather than the &quot;Doppelganger&quot; account, so the &quot;real&quot; account will show up in the page history. This will help to prevent vandals from using the template to &quot;validate&quot; imposter accounts. Please '''do not''' use this template on the page of a user believed to be an imposter. Use [[Template:Blocked user]] instead.

This template will correct itself based on the gender set in the [[Special:Preferences|preferences]] of your real user account (i.e. in the sentence &quot;Please see their talk page for any relevant discussion&quot;, &quot;their&quot; will change to &quot;his&quot; or &quot;her&quot;).

This template adds pages to [[:Category:Doppelganger accounts]].

===Usage===
This template is used to explicitly notify people of the blocked status of a certain user. While everyone can add this tag, it should typically only be placed by the blocking administrator. If the blocker doesn't think it's needed, the odds are it isn't.

The template adds the &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOINDEX__&lt;/nowiki&gt; keyword.

===Examples of usage===
{| style=&quot;width:46%; background:transparent;&quot;
|style=&quot;width:17%;&quot;|Account blocked indefinitely
|style=&quot;width:29%; text-align:left;&quot;|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{blocked user}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|}
&lt;div style=&quot;position:relative; left:210px; bottom:45px;&quot;&gt;
{{blocked user}}
&lt;/div&gt;

{| style=&quot;width:46%; background:transparent;&quot;
|style=&quot;width:17%;&quot;|Account blocked for six months
|style=&quot;width:29%;&quot;|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{blocked user|time=six months}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|}
&lt;div style=&quot;position:relative; left:210px; bottom:45px;&quot;&gt;
{{blocked user|time=six months}}
&lt;/div&gt;

{|style=&quot;width:46%; background:transparent;&quot;
|style=&quot;width:17%;&quot;|IP blocked for six months
|style=&quot;width:29%;&quot;|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{blocked user|ip|time=six months}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|}
&lt;div style=&quot;position:relative; left:210px; bottom:45px;&quot;&gt;
{{blocked user|ip|time=six months}}
&lt;/div&gt;

{|style=&quot;width:46%; background:transparent;&quot;
|style=&quot;width:17%;&quot;|IP blocked for six months by Jimbo Wales
|style=&quot;width:29%;&quot;|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{blocked user|ip|time=six months|by=[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|}
&lt;div style=&quot;position:relative; left:210px; bottom:45px;&quot;&gt;
{{blocked user|ip|time=six months|by=[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]]}}

      <comment>move grammar-based compression to [[Data Compression/grammar-based compression]], since it doesn't use Markov models.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Markov algorithms ==

Markov algorithms are data compression algorithms
that have the Markov assumption:
the plaintext was produced by something that can be approximated by a Markov model -- i.e.,
a Markov chain or hidden Markov model or variable-order Markov model or something similar.

Dictionary algorithms can always be
emulated by Markov algorithms, but not the converse.
&lt;ref name=&quot;lzrw4&quot;&gt;
Ross Williams.
[http://www.ross.net/compression/download/original/old_lzrw4.txt &quot;LZRW4: ZIV AND LEMPEL MEET MARKOV&quot;].
1991.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Fully general Markov models are used in some of the most complicated algorithms with the best compression ratio known -- alas, they are also some of the slowest algorithms in use.

=== PPP Predictor Compression Protocol ===

Perhaps the simplest possible Markov algorithm is the PPP Predictor Compression Protocol,
as implemented by Timo Raita and standardized by RFC 1978.&lt;ref&gt;
RFC 1978
&lt;/ref&gt;

It looks at (approximately) the 3 or 4 most-recently-decoded bytes, finds the last time that sequence occurred, and guesses that the following byte will be the same following byte as last time.

The inner loop of the Predictor decompressor is something like this:
* The Predictor decoder reads a flag byte, containing 8 flags. Each flag bit corresponds to one byte of reconstructed decompressed data.
* For each of the 8 flag bits:
** If the flag bit is 0, then the guess was wrong. The Predictor decoder reads a literal byte from the compressed data, and pass it straight through to the decompressed text. Also store that literal byte in the GuessTable[context], so perhaps the next time this happens we will guess right.
** If the flag bit is 1, then the guess was right. Read the guess from GuessTable[context] and write it to the decompressed text.
** Update the context from the byte we just wrote out to the decompressed text.
* Repeat until there are no more compressed bytes to read.

In any given context, one byte value is the most-likely next-byte.
The Predictor compresses that most-likely next-byte to 1 bit.
When any other byte occurs, the Predictor expands it to 9 bits.
The Predictor can get pretty good compression even when it guesses wrong half the time.

=== 1st order Markov ===

The 1st order Markov decompressor algorithm is a little more sophisticated than the Predictor algorithm.

After decompressing some byte, a 1st order Markov decompressor looks at every time that byte has ever occurred before.&lt;ref&gt;
Rather than literally scanning the entire plaintext-so-far for each byte it decompresses,
most programmers use a much faster approach that gives the same results:
the program updates an internal hash table or 2D array for each byte it decompresses,
then directly fetches the data it needs for the next byte from that data structure.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In any given 1-byte context, one byte value is the most-likely next-byte; some other byte value is the next-most-likely next-byte ... and so on; typically there are a few bytes that have only occurred once each in this context -- those are the next-least-likely next-byte values; and typically there are a few bytes that have never occurred in this context -- those are the least-likely next-byte values.

The 1st order Markov decompressor uses some entropy coder to assign each possible next-byte value a unique prefix codeword, such that the more-likely bytes are given a short codeword, the less-likely bytes are given a longer codeword (perhaps 8 bits), and the least-likely bytes are given a long codeword (longer than 8 bits).

In some cases, where the next-byte is overwhelmingly likely to be one particular byte (for example, the byte following 'q' is almost always 'u' in English text), 1st order Markov compresses those cases just as well as the Predictor algorithm.
In other cases, Markov compresses significantly better than the Predictor algorithm, because it can compress 'likely' bytes even when they are not the one most-likely byte.

Higher-order letter-level and word-level Markov chains are better at predicting &quot;likely&quot; English phrases.
Some people create &quot;parody generators&quot; out of Markov decoders by allowing them to build a Markov chain, but instead of feeding the decoder the particular compressed codewords that give the Markov decoder enough clues to reconstruct some particular plaintext, they feed the Markov decoder randomly-generated bits.&lt;ref&gt;
Jon Bentley.
[http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/pearls/sec153.html &quot;Generating Text&quot;]
(Section 15.3 of
Programming Pearls)
2000.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== model mixing ==

The decompression algorithms with the best compression typically use
several different models,
each one giving predictions of the next bit or byte,
and somehow mix those predictions together
to get a final prediction
to feed into the entropy coder.
As long as the final prediction is not zero or one (never-happens or always-happens),
the decompressor can decode all files without error
(see [[../The zero-frequency problem/]] for details).

Alas, so far we do not yet know the &quot;best&quot; way to combine such predictions.
There are several ad-hoc ways that people have developed to mix predictions together.
Some mixing techniques appear to be &quot;better&quot;, in that they
produce smaller compressed files than other mixing techniques
(and better than using any one of the underlying predictions alone).

Before we get to the actual &quot;context mixing&quot; algorithms,
let's look at PPM and DMC, which directly use the predictions
from one single context or another
(rather than mixing predictions):

=== PPM ===

Prediction by partial matching&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikipedia: Prediction by partial matching]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
is perhaps the simplest to understand mixing technique.
PPM maintains Markov models of several different orders.
A PPM(5) decoder uses a 5th order Markov model whenever possible.
If no prediction can be made based on all 5 context symbols --
i.e., the 5 most-recently decoded bytes have never occurred in that order before --
then it falls back on a 4th order Markov model.
If the 4th order model cannot make a prediction --
i.e., the 4 most-recently-decoded bytes have never occurred in that order before --
then it falls back on a 3rd order Markov model.
The PPM decoder will eventually find some Markov model it can use to compress the text,
even if it has to fall all the way back to the default zero order Markov model.

=== Dynamic Markov compression ===

Dynamic Markov compression was developed by Gordon Cormack and Nigel Horspool.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikipedia: Dynamic Markov compression]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Gordon Cormack published his DMC implementation in C in 1993, under a non-commercial license.&lt;ref&gt;
Gordon V. Cormack.
&quot;Dynamic Markov Compression (DMC)    Version 0.0.0&quot;.
1993.
[http://plg1.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ftp/dmc/dmc.c dmc.c]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Dynamic Markov compression is a lossless data compression algorithm very similar to PPM,
except it predicts one bit at a time, rather than predicting a byte at a time.
This makes it slower but gives slightly better compression.
It is used as a model or submodel in several highly experimental implementations.
{{todo| ... give more details on DMC &quot;cloning&quot; ...}}

The predictions are fed into an arithmetic coder.
(Because the predictions are made one bit at a time, simple Huffman coding rather than arithmetic coding would give no compression).

== model mixing ==
Some model mixing / context mixing approaches include:


Context tree weighting&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikipedia: Context tree weighting]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
is another mixing technique.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Parkour}}
==History==
It may be argued that Parkour has been around since the dawn of man and his passion to move, be it for fun or for survival. Thus we shall focus on Parkour in the modern day, and how it came to be known by this name. Parkour or l'art du déplacement (the art of movement)is a term coined by Hubert Koundé after meeting with David Belle. The term Parkour was inspired by Georges Hébert's Natural Method theory. Georges Hébert (27 April 1875 in Paris – 2 August 1957 in Tourgéville, Calvados) was an Officer in the French Navy which allowed for him to travel extensively and he was inspired by the way that Indigenous people in Africa and elsewhere were able to traverse the natural environment so fluidly, quickly and elegantly while having no idea of modern European Gymnastic techniques. Hébert respected physical fitness and was so impressed by the African Native's way of moving that when he returned to France to work as a physical instructor in the army, he had devised a new way to train, which he called the Natural Method. Contrary to popular belief the Indigenous people which he observed are not solely responsible for inspiring Hébert. Other notable people whom he studied and learned from include Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, Dr. Paul Carton and Georges Demenÿ to name but a few. What did not satisfy Hébert about the Gymnastics oriented training regimes of his time was that it did not prepare the students to real life situations and he thought the competition aspect to it was morally degrading. His proposed a method of training that was closer to real life so that in a genuine emergency those undergoing the Natural Method would be conditioned to respond quickly and effectively. The following will be a basic outline of the type of exercises which are to be performed in an average Natural Method training session.

&quot;A (Natural Method) session is composed of exercises belonging to the ten fundamental groups: walking, running, jumping, quadrupedal movement(movement while on all fours), climbing, equilibrium (balancing), throwing, lifting, defending and swimming.

A training session consists, then, of exercises in an outdoor environment - a course of greater or lesser distance (a few hundred meters to several kilometers), during which, one walks, one runs, one jumps, one progresses quadrupedally, one climbs, one walks in unstable balance, one raises and one carries, one throws, one fights and one swims.

This course can be carried out in 2 ways:

1 - the natural or spontaneous way; i.e., on an unspecified route through the countryside.

2 - within an especially designed environment.

All of the exercises can be carried out while progressing through this environment.

Finally, the session can last from 20 to 60 minutes.&quot; (From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_H%C3%A9bert)

Georges Hébert was also credited as being the first to utilize an obstacle course design in his training method. Today obstacle courses are used in most physically demanding professions such as Policing, Firefighting and the Army. The connection between David Belle's Parkour and Georges Hébert's Natural Method can be seen if we use the french term for obstacles course, which is Parcour. Even by definition, Parkour is a way of moving through the environment in a quick, fluid and efficient manner, as if tackling an obstacle course. David Belle borrowed a lot of Hébert's ideas and principles when he along with his friends were experimenting with movement in the urban environment in Lisses during the 90's. Belle's thirst for movement was not easily quenched, seeing as how Raymond Belle(David Belles Father) was a decorated soldier and part of the French Army's elite firefighting squad entrusted to handle the most dangerous rescue missions. David Belle wished to join the firefighting brigade as his father has but due to personal drama and injuries it did not work out. Through this can trace both David and Reymond's altruistic attitudes to Hébert who advocated that physical excellence should be complimented by altruistic acts of heroism and courage in the face of danger. David was also inspired by his maternal grandfather Gilbert Kitten who evoked in him a passion for heroism. David experimented with many styles of movement, ranging from Kung Fu to Gymnastics. David also joined the Troupes de Marine, and even though he excelled there thanks to his high physical fitness level, he could not stay due to the impossible combination of his love of adventure and strict military life. After that he worked various jobs and began filming his abilities, which caught the attention of Stage 2 films who decided to showcase David's discipline in a series of collaborations, which ignited his acting and stunting career in the film industry.


==Philosophy==
Parkour is a non-competitive discipline which emphasizes the practitioner to be strong and flexible as to be able to move quickly and efficiently through any given environment so to be able to react during emergency situations. It is safe to say that the motto for parkour is the motto of Georges Hébert's &quot;Méthode Naturelle&quot;; &quot;être fort pour être utile&quot; (&quot;be strong to be useful&quot;).(From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Hebert) The reason parkour is a non-competitive discipline and not a sport is the same reason for Hébert's dissatisfaction with the dominant gymnastics style oriented training of his time. Being a very moral man and believing in altruism, Hébert thought that remedial Gymnastics exercises and its predominant concentration on performance and competition did not prepare his students for the physical and moral challenges of the real world. He believed one should not strive to be strong simply to win a medal or hold a trophy, but to be ready to use his/her skills to be useful in times of crisis and danger. His view was shaped by his heroism during his time in the town of St. Pierre which was afflicted by  a volcanic eruption. Thanks to Hébert around 700 people where saved. From that moment on his view was cemented that an athlete should not only be physically strong, but also morally just and should strive use his or her skills in altruistic ways rather than to use them to simply glorify oneself. Parkour is a discipline and not a sport because it has no set boundaries, time limits or rules which are mandatory to follow. There are no teams or tournaments. The only thing that is given is a set list of movements which David Belle, Sebastien Foucan and the Yamakasi have judged to be the most efficient and safe. These moves are tools for the practitioner to use when traversing their environment and there will be times when the practitioner will have to turn to the Hébert's Natural Method in order to find the quickest route. Though there is competition against one's fears and against the environment when practicing parkour, competition against a fellow practitioner is discouraged which is another major aspect of parkour which sets it apart from most other sports.</text>

      <comment>/* Objects */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page illustrates the Ruby Code Examples, in a straight way than to lengthy explanations, this can be used like an immediate reference for both syntax and programming ideas. Concise mothods attempting a problem with a pragmatic approach are also discussed.
==Basics==
===Simple I/O===
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts 'Hi!'                   # puts the string to stdout
print 'enter your name:'     # print does not terminate with default \n at the end of execution
name = gets.chomp            # read from stdin
puts &quot;Hi! #{name}&quot;           # interpolates the string, replaces name with its value 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
===Strings===
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
print 'c:\books\net\apps\tools'    # outputs, c:\books\net\apps\tools
print &quot;c:\books&quot;                   # outputs, books
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
String interpolation allows a variable to get replaced by its value while execution
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
One = 1
puts &quot;#{One} is a number&quot;      # outputs, 1 is a number
puts &quot;%d is a number&quot; % One    # outputs, 1 is a number
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
%Q and %q are string literals that are with special properties
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts %Q^ is Quote friendly^
puts %q# you can type &quot;Quotes&quot;!! #    # outputs, you can type &quot;Quotes&quot;!!
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Multiline Strings are defined with '&lt;&lt;' prefix to a named delimiter, like 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts &lt;&lt;XYZ
Normally programmers try to code to solve the problem and forgets once it is done,
but some explore more, to find a concise opproach to the problem,
and thats makes him !(repetative)
XYZ
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Ruby is really flexible with strings
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
# choose the one you like
' this '
&quot; this &quot;
%/ this /
%q{ this }
%Q^ this ^
# value =&gt; &quot; this &quot; 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The string delimiter pairs are &lt;nowiki&gt; '', &quot;&quot;, but with %, %q and %Q prefix, we have  //, {}, ##,&lt;/nowiki&gt; as delimiters, the unofficial rule is to use the delimiter that is not used to declare the string itself, this is to declare [[Wikipedia:String_literal#Raw_strings|raw strings]] to avoid [[Wikipedia:Delimiter#Delimiter collision|delimiter collision]]
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts %/ '' &quot;&quot; {} ## ^^ /    # outputs,  '' &quot;&quot; {} ## ^^ 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Objects===
An Object is something that can be handled with defined Methods, even for the physical objects arround us there are defined methods in using them, whenever we say 'object' it is to mean that it has some methods through which the object can be handled
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
-1.abs                               # =&gt; 1
'1234567'.length                     # =&gt; 7 
1234567.to_s.length                  # =&gt; 7
3.times {print 3}                    # outputs, 333
rand(10).times { |x| puts x }        # =&gt; random set of numbers from 0 to 10
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Ruby is object oriented, everything is an object including numbers, strings and even the &lt;i&gt;nil&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
1.class        # =&gt; Fixnum
1.0.class      # =&gt; Float
'xyz'.class    # =&gt; String
nil.class      # =&gt; NilClass
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Enumerators, Ranges, Arrays and Hashes===
Each of these can use the ''each'' method for iteration, though they seems to be synonyms, there is lot of difference in computing, The [[Wikipedia:Iterator|Enumerators and Ranges]] are almost of fixed memory length and so are memory efficient and fast, whereas [[Wikipedia:Array|Arrays]] and [[Wikipedia:Hash table|Hashes]] involves complex [[Wikipedia:Data structure|data structures]] for to be dynamic 
====Enumerators====
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
5.times.class       # =&gt; Enumerator
5.upto(10).class    # =&gt; Enumerator
5.upto(10).next     # =&gt; 5
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
====Ranges====
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
(0...10).class    # =&gt; Range
(0..9).class      # =&gt; Range
(0..2).first      # =&gt; 0
(0..2).last       # =&gt; 2 
(1..5).next       # invalid, Range class doesent have next method

(0..3).each { |x| print x }              # outputs, 0123
(0...10).reverse_each { |x| print x }    # outputs, 9876543210
(-3..3).each.abs { |x| print x }         # invalid
(-3..3).each { |x| print x.abs }         # outputs, 3210123

# Enumerator dosent require 'each' to iterate
5.upto(10).class                         # =&gt; Enumerator
5.upto(10) { |x| print x }               # outputs, 5678910 
(5..10).each { |x| print x }             # outputs, 5678910
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Arrays====
An [[Wikipedia:Array|array]] is a collection of elements, by default an array of ''n'' elements has its '''index''' enumerated from ''0'' to ''n-1'', i.e, the index to the first element of an array is ''0''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
a = [4,6,7,5]    # simple array declaration 
a.length         # =&gt; 4
a.rotate         # =&gt; [6, 7, 5, 4]
a.sort           # =&gt; [4, 5, 6, 7]
a.sort.reverse   # =&gt; [7, 6, 5, 4]
a[0]             # =&gt; 4
a[3]             # =&gt; 5
a[4] = 3         # =&gt; 3 ;resulting array is [4, 6, 7, 5, 3]
a &lt;&lt; 1           # =&gt; [4, 6, 7, 5, 3, 1] ; useful when array size is unknown
a[10] = 0        # =&gt; 0 ;resulting array is [4, 6, 7, 5, 3, 1, nil, nil, nil, nil, 0]
a.length         # =&gt; 11
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
array of arrays, array of ranges and arrays of mixed '''datatypes''' are allowed to declare, '''Object Oriented'''!
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
hex = [(0..9),('A'..'F')]
hex.each { |x| x.each { |y| print y }}    # outputs, 0123456789ABCDEF

# declare an array of arrays
nums = [[0,1], [2,3,4,5,6,7], [8,9], ['A','B','C','D','E','F']]
binary = nums[0]                         # =&gt; [0, 1]
octal = nums[0] + nums[1]                # =&gt; [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
decimal = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2]    # =&gt; [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
hexadecimal = nums.flatten               # =&gt; [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,'A','B','C','D','E','F']
octal = (binary + octal).uniq            # =&gt; [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]    # array of 6 elements
b = a.map { |x| 2**x }    # =&gt; [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Hashes====
[[Wikipedia:Hash table|Hash]] is an [[Wikipedia:Associative array|associative array]] which is a collections of '''Keys''' and it's associated '''Values'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
capitals = {                  
:karnataka  =&gt; 'Banglore',
:maharastra =&gt; 'Mumbai'
}
capitals[:westbengal] = 'Kolkata'     # append a new element
capitals[:karnataka] = 'Bengaluru'    # change an element's association
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Iterators and Blocks===
====Iterators====
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
alias chant print
108.times {chant 'maRa'}    # see the change for yourself
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
====Blocks====
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
def iterator
        yield 'yield, '
       	yield 'blocks,'
	yield 'Ruby'
end
iterator {|yeilded| print &quot;use #{yeilded}&quot;}    # outputs, use yield, use blocks, use Ruby&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Should zero be included in a book titled &quot;Numbers from 1 to 20&quot;?

Its clearly not between 1 and 20.

{{unsigned|128.175.121.231|15:38, 18 August 2011}}

The title of the book is actually &quot;Numbers from 1 to 20/0&quot; which includes zero.

--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 15:54, 18 August 2011 (UTC)

:I agree this page should be deleted, as the '''book''' title is actually &quot;Numbers from 1 to 20&quot; which does not include zero. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 16:47, 29 August 2011 (UTC)

:: Why does the title of the book have &quot;/0&quot; tacked on the end of it?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 20:25, 29 August 2011 (UTC)

::: I've only just realised myself - it has '''/0''' tacked on the end because that's the page location '''book/page'''.  I still think it's useful to have the concept of zero on here though especially as the concept is more recent than that of the other numbers.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:34, 29 August 2011 (UTC)

::::I suppose you could argue that the numbers 10 and 20 contain the figure 0, so zero is required to understand numbers greater than 9. I imagine the target age for this book is towards the lower end of the general Wikijunior audience, but I don't know myself how numbers are actually taught in real schools. Perhaps most children are taught even larger numbers before being formally introduced to the concept of zero. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 20:48, 29 August 2011 (UTC)

::::: Historically, I believe, the use of a placeholder symbol in numeric notation (like the digit &quot;0&quot; in &quot;10&quot; and &quot;20&quot;) predated the perception of zero as a number by numerous centuries; the number zero is an advanced concept.  This has also manifested in the past half century as a feud between mathematicians who say zero is not a ''natural number'' and computer scientists who say it is.  (Afaik the feud continues, though one imagines the computer people are slowly winning through cultural dominance.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 16:29, 30 August 2011 (UTC)</text>

== Languages of Europe ==
[[Wikijunior:Languages/Russian|Russian]] is the language spoken by the most people in Europe with native speakers found in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and other parts of Europe.

The European Union has 24 official languages. Many Europeans speak 2 or 3 languages but the most common language to learn, by a long way, is English.
[[Image:European Parliament languages.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Plaque on the European Union parliament building in Brussels, Belgium showing the name of the institution in the official languages of the EU]]
Most languages spoken in Europe are '''Indo-European languages''' which are languages which originated between Europe and India.  The Indo-European languages in Europe can be divided into different groups:
# '''[[Wikijunior:Languages/Albanian|Albanian]]''' - spoken in [[../Albania|Albania]] and Kosovo
# '''Armenian''' - spoken in [[../Armenia|Armenia]]
# '''Baltic Languages''' - [[Wikijunior:Languages/Lithuanian|Lithuanian]] (in [[../Lithuania|Lithuania]]) and Latvian (in [[../Latvia|Latvia]])
# '''Celtic Languages''' - [[Wikijunior:Languages/Welsh|Welsh]], Scottish Gaelic, Cornish and [[Wikijunior:Languages/Manx Gaelic|Manx]], all spoken in the [[../United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] or countries which depend on the UK.  Also [[Wikijunior:Languages/Irish|Irish]] and Breton, spoken in [[../Ireland|Ireland]] and [[../France|France]].
# '''Germanic Languages''' - English (UK, Ireland and Malta), [[German]] (Germany, Austria and Switzerland), Dutch (Netherlands and Belgium), Danish (Denmark), Norwegian (Norway), Swedish (Sweden and Finland) and Icelandic (Iceland).
# '''Greek''' - spoken in Greece and Cyprus.
# '''Romance Languages''' - [[Wikijunior:Languages/Catalan|Catalan]] (Spain), [[French]] (France, Switzerland, Belgium), [[Italian]] (Italy and Slovenia), [[Portuguese]] (Portugal), [[Romanian]] (Romania and Moldova), Sardinian (Italy), Sicilian (Italy) and [[Spanish]] (Spain).
# '''Slavic Languages''' - [[Russian]] (Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Belarus), [[Ukrainian]] (Ukraine), Belarusian (Belarus), Czech (Czech Republic), [[Polish]] (Poland), Slovak (Slovakia), Bulgarian (Bulgaria), Macedonian (Macedonia), Slovene (Slovenia and Italy) and Serbian/Croatian/Montenegrin/Bosnian (Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro and Bosnia Herzegovina)

There are a few languages spoken in Europe which are not Indo-European languages:
# '''Kartvelian Languages''' - this group includes [[Wikijunior:Languages/Georgian|Georgian]], spoken in [[../Georgia|Georgia]].
# '''Uralic Languages''' - this group includes Estonian (Estonia), Finnish (Finland) and Hungarian (Hungary and Serbia)
# '''Turkic Languages''' - this group includes Turkish (Turkey and Cyprus), Azerbaijani (Azerbaijan) and Kazakh (Kazakhstan)
# '''Semitic Languages''' - this group includes Maltese (Malta)

All of the languages above - those in the Indo-European Language group or those from other groups are all related in some way to other languages.  There is one language spoken in Europe which has no relation to any other language in the world:
# '''Basque''' - spoken in Spain and France.

You can read more about European languages and other world languages at [[Wikijunior:Languages|Wikijunior Languages]]

== Alphabets of Europe ==

[[File:Scripts in Europe.png|thumb|right|250px|Main alphabets used in Europe:
{{legend|#0000FF|Latin alphabet}}
{{legend|#FF0000|Cyrillic alphabet}}
{{legend|#00FF00|Greek alphabet}}
{{legend|#800080|Latin and Cyrillic alphabet}}
{{legend|#05D3D3|Greek and Latin alphabet}}
]]

* The Latin alphabet is used in most of Europe.  Most EU countries use this alphabet.  The first letters of the Latin alphabet are: A, B, C
* The Cyrillic alphabet is used in some parts of Eastern Europe and South Eastern Europe.  At present, [[../Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] is the only EU country using this alphabet.  [[../Serbia|Serbia]], [[../Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[../Bosnia_Herzegovina|Bosnia]] are noteworthy because both Latin and Cyrillic alphabets are regularly used in those countries.  The first letters of the Russian Cyrillic alphabet are: а, б, в
* The Greek alphabet is used in [[../Greece|Greece]] and [[../Cyprus|Cyprus]].  The first letters of the Greek alphabet are: Α, Β, Γ
* The Georgian alphabet is used in Georgia.  The first letters of the Georgian alphabet are: ა, ბ, გ

    <title>General Engineering Introduction/Truth Beauty Goodness</title>
    <ns>0</ns>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[wikipedia:Golden_mean_(philosophy)|Truth and Beauty]] evolved out of Greek culture as a pair. Without goodness, concepts such as [[w:Zero#Greeks_and_Romans|zero]] and &amp;pi; were thought to be evil. [[wikipedia:Meditations_on_First_Philosophy#Meditation_IV:_Concerning_the_True_and_the_False|René Descartes]], made the closest possible link between the good and the true.

The most positive description of a concluded project is &quot;Elegant.&quot; Engineering starts with a problem and comes up with a solution. Solutions are judged just like all experiences of life. Most engineers look at a solution and quickly form an opinion. It is either &quot;elegant or kludgey&quot;. A project's solution is Elegant when it combines Truth, Beauty and Goodness. A &quot;kludgey&quot; project has to be good ... it has to work for a little bit. It may be ugly. It may not look like it is going to work.

There are as many different engineering design philosophies as there are companies. Underlying all of them is an engineering intuition. Truth Beauty and Goodness are expressed many different ways: Integrity, Form, Function. Or perhaps analytical, intuitive, emperical.

===Truth===

Truth, Integrity, Transparency are collectively called &quot;Engineering Ethics&quot;. There are frequently conflicting demands on engineers. While it is impossible to use a single decision-making process to solve every ethical dilemma, it is clear that ethical considerations will force engineers to subjugate their own self-interests.

The truth part of engineering comes up most in Design Reviews and Engineering Sales. Design Reviews are meetings where engineers pick apart each others work, try to find all the flaws, try to brainstorm every alternative. Design reviews are not sensitive to feelings or politics. 

Engineering Sales are completely different than normal used car sales. Engineering sales positions require communication of truth. Commodity sales people who will do anything to make you a deal.

===Beauty===

Art. Symmetry is one of the first forms of beauty learned. Pattern is another. Shapes or functions used repeatedly turn into part libraries and standards. Mechanical engineers see springs everywhere and learn what an ideal pin joint is. Electrical engineers see Nand gates, resistors, capacitors, inductors and op amps arranged in different ways. Computer engineers learn &quot;objects&quot; or &quot;unit testing&quot; and chemical engineers chop processes up into &quot;[[:w:Unit_operation|Unit Operations]]&quot;. Each has it's own beauty.

===Goodness===

Function is a form of Goodness. A bridge that works is good. A product that makes money is good. A building that lasts for 200 years is good. A cup that sun light decomposes into environmentally friendly way is excellent. Does the solution solve the problem? Goodness is simplicity that enables the user and other engineers to look at something and immediately know how to use it, fix it and/or it improve it.

Goodness from the personal level involves the ideal future (morality, victory, eventuation, growth, greatness, strong character, etc.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Engineering projects are not successful unless the participants are enthusiastic. Enthusiasm does not seduce or blind or happen to us. Enthusiasm is found, nurtured, and explored. 

Don't stop because you lack of experience or have doubts about your abilities. Don't worry about costs. These realities will be dealt with later. Not now. The goal is to dream and find enthusiasm.

Don't let the complexity of engineering limit your idea creation. Don't feel that the project has to be finished during this semester. Some of the best projects continue for years with different student teams working on them.

Don't worry about idea ownership. Write in your engineering notebook properly and you will own any ideas you come up with.

==Starting New Project==
At anytime you can propose new project ideas to your instructor. The instructor may or may not create a wikipage for the project idea. In most cases you will be asked to choose between projects that others thought of and worked on. But if your idea is successful, the next step is to convince some other classmates to choose your project as their top preference when the next team formation cycle begins.

==Writing a Project Idea==

The project idea could start with one of these phrases like a TV game show.

:I wish ................................
:What if .............................
:How to .............................
:We could ..........................

A project idea is short. The shorter the better. It should stimulate, inspire, trigger visions in those that read it.

Write all the ideas first in your engineering notebook. Collect them there. After a week, read the ideas. Do they still make sense? Can they be turned into a General Engineering Project? If so, propose them to your instructor.

==Stimulating Engineering Ideas==

The following is designed to help stimulate ideas. You can also read about existing projects under projects.

Don't you hate it when _____________ ... when you have to [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpYrJs0rX84 take a bath] (tedx video].

Fill in the blank. This could be a project. This is where many successful patents start.

===Service===

Think of someone you know that needs something. Prude focuses on NGO's (non government organizations). Athelas, here in Columbia, is always a source of service projects. Volunteers for Medical Engineering (VME) serves the needs of handicapped people in the Baltimore area.

===Issues===

Issues are frustrations that people have given names to. Ask someone what their issues are.

===Ugly===

Orange text is ugly. Many people have a sense of beauty that guides them. Ask them what is ugly in their lives.

===Accustomed to Irritation===

This is different than &quot;Don't you hate it when&quot; because accustomed means that you don't notice it. You may have lived with an outhouse your entire life and don't know that that a toilet even exists.

===Problems===

A problem is a matured issue. Someone has owned the problem. I have a problem. This doesn't mean the problem is fixed. It means that someone is willing to put the time, money, enthusiasm into fixing the problem.

===Improve===

Improve something that already exists. NOT REPAIR. Improve so it does not need to be repaired.

===Patent===

Dream up an idea that could lead to a patent.

===Profit===

Make money building and then selling something.

===Repeat Science===

Look through Science News (there is a magazine by this name), Nature Magazine, New Scientist, or listen to science pod casts for stuff that is interesting. Find an experiment or project that can be replicated. Look through the magazines in the front of the class. Read.

===Art===

Do something that inspires, educates, attracts attention.

===Competition===

There are lots of robot, engineering competitions. The AIAA needs people to help design wind tunnel competitions. Some engineering colleges make up competitions just for the freshmen. For example: make a clock with an alarm from material left over from a ship wreck.

===Customer===

Think of the project as a job. Perhaps you have had a part time job where you noticed something that could be improved. There may be a way to get paid for this work.

===Reverse Engineering===

Perhaps there is something that you have always wanted to take apart to see how it works. Has to be something complicated like a disposable digital camera.

===Lazy===

Laziness is the mother of invention.

===Read about other Engineering Projects===

Read Engineering Magazines. Here are some ... not all.

Read Mechanics Illustrated or Science News. Listen to pod casts of Science Friday. Monitor the technology section of [http://gizmodo.com/ Gizmodo] or [http://www.reddit.com/ reddit]. Pay for AUVSI and ASEE news feeds. Pick two. Create a daily discipline of reading something stimulating. Pay attention to what engineers are doing in areas that spark your interest. Go to other colleges and look at what engineering projects they are doing. Figure out how new stuff works:

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[General_Engineering_Introduction/Communication#BrainStorming/|BrainStorming]] is a group communication process. It is a documentation tool that can convince others that everything possible was thought of while making a group [[General_Engineering_Introduction/Decisions|decision]]. Below are intangible comments that inspire and help keep the creative conversation going.

==Multiple Solutions==

Brain Storming is not complete until there are multiple solutions. The best way is to not talk about solutions with each other, but silently go off alone and create solutions. Then come back together as a team, see who came up with the same idea. Other's ideas should spark more solutions in your own mind. So this process may be repeated. If done correctly there will be multiple solutions.

==Solution Characteristics==

===Positive===
Einstein described his special abilities this way: &quot;I have the talent of absorbing positive knowledge.&quot; All solutions are positive. 
Simplicity, Symmetry, Synchronicity are all concepts that engineers leverage. 

===Expedient===
There are times when duct tape, paper clips, pieces of a comb and wads of chewing gum are necessary. Creative, expedient solutions are necessary in times of a crisis. Tampons stop leaks. Solutions that don't scale, don't meet the scope or specifications, solutions that just get through the demonstration and then break are called &quot;Kludgy.&quot; 

===KISS===
Keep it Simple Stupid. The more complex something is, the less likely it is going to work. There is beauty in a 15 line program that does the same thing as a 2000 line program. A 15 line program can also be more beautiful than a tricky 1 line program doing the same thing because it is easy to understand, modify, and reuse. 

===Expected===
There is beauty in a case that hasn't been opened for 15 years, yet upon opening it the instructions for making the adjustment are printed in an obvious spot.

===Reduce to the Absurd===
This is how engineers use the argument tatic &quot;[[:w:Reductio_ad_absurdum|Reductio_ad_absurdum]].&quot; Go to the extremes. Make the gaps bigger, make the angles larger or smaller. Change the timing. Follow the trends past normal operating points. List everything. The absurd can inspire.

===Persist===
James Eads competed with the Army Core of Engineering to come up with connecting the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. After a storm, the Mississippi was less than 8 feet deep, ships couldn't get to the ocean. Work on the New Orleans docks stopped. Dredging was not an option. The Army wanted to build a canal. Eads proposed building twin jetties that would force the river to dig its own channel by speeding the flow of water. Newspapers carried Eads arguments that his idea was more in &quot;harmony with nature&quot;. The Army Core of Engineering argued that it would never work. The project took five years and was completed in 1879. Precisely as Eads had predicted, the current scoured its own bottom, pushing the silt far out into the deep Gulf waters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This ''Casebook'' contains a set of case studies. It was initially developed as part of CE5212/PA5232 Transportation Policy, Planning, and Deployment at the University of Minnesota taught by Prof. David Levinson. The cases themselves are developed by students.

== Cases ==

Written Case Study Report should include
* Summary, 
* Annotated List of Actors, 
* Timeline of Events, 
* Maps of Locations, 
* Clear Identification of Policy Issues, 
* Narrative of the Case, 
* Discussion Questions. 
* Complete References of Cited (primary and secondary) Documents). (with hyperlinks as appropriate)

It should be written from a Neutral Point-of-View. Online encyclopedias are not acceptable sources for citation (feel free to read to get background information, but they are at best tertiary sources).

The report should be on the order of 3000-5000 words. It should be fully referenced. Additional readings on the order of 30 -100 pages  should be assigned with the case, these will be linked on the case web page or handed out in class.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This Casebook presents the results of an assignment for CE5212/PA5232 Transportation Policy, Planning, and Deployment to describe the lifecycle of a transportation technology or mode.

== The Assignment ==
Recall that the cycle of technology includes a birthing phase, a growth-development phase, and a mature phase (and perhaps a declining phase). The stage of the life-cycle, it has been argued, determines the nature of transportation policy-making -- both the problems faced and the responses to these problems.  In this assignment, you are to research and reflect upon the life-cycle of a transportation mode.  Your final product should be about 15 pages of single-spaced 12 point Times New Roman text, including tables and charts.

Your initial step is to select a mode (or transportation or related technology).   As long as the technology you pick can be related to the movement of people, goods, or ideas it is fine.  If you have questions, contact your instructor.

Then the assignment has two parts: Quantitative and Qualitative. Each part is worth 50% of the assignment.

=== Quantitative ===

Overview the life-cycle of the mode.  Using S-curves (status vs. time), identify the periods of birthing growth, and maturity.  For status use variables that reflect the level of deployment or use of the mode (number of vehicles, kilometers of track, passenger-kilometers traveled).  You may develop these curves for the US, some other country, or geographical unit, as data availability and your focus dictate.  Use the data to estimate a three-parameter logistic function:

&lt;math&gt;
S(t) = K/[1+e^{(-b(t-t_0)}]
&lt;/math&gt;

where:

* &lt;math&gt;S(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the status measure,  (e.g. Passenger-km traveled)
* &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time (usually in years),
* &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the inflection time (year in which 1/2 K is achieved),
* &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is saturation status level,
* &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is a coefficient.  

&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are to be estimated.

Graph the model and the data.  How accurate is the model?

Interpret your results, and use them to help affix dates to the birthing, growth, and maturity stages of the life-cycle.

Sources of data vary.  There is sufficient data on the world wide web to do this assignment for many technologies and modes, though there are obviously modes and technologies for which this will be difficult.  For a good starter source, try the Bureau of Transportation Statistics ( http://www.bts.gov ). However, make sure that you get data that goes to the birthing phase of the technology, many of their data series only go back to 1960.  For other data sources, the world wide web and the university library, as well as the Mn/DOT library are good places to go.

==== Get your data ====

GET YOUR DATA FIRST.

==== How to estimate a model: ====

An example spreadsheet is at:

http://nexus.umn.edu/Courses/ce5212/RailReinvented.xls

Basically, this is an exercise in curve fitting.  There are better and worse ways to do curve fitting, one (a better way, but not the best way) is shown in the example spreadsheet.

Worse ways to do curve fitting include random trial and error (pick some values, see how close the curve is, and adjust the values). 

Better ways involve using a formal statistical procedure (e.g. Ordinary Least Squares Regression).  Fortunately, regression is a routine procedure found in many statistical packages, as well as in spreadsheets.  To do a regression in an excel spreadsheet, you can find the tool under the TOOLS menu in the DATA ANALYSIS option.  (If DATA ANALYSIS does not appear on your menu, go to TOOLS/ADD INS, and Check the DATA ANALYSIS Toolbox).

A single variable linear regression simply estimates the coefficients c and b in a  model of the form:

&lt;math&gt;
Y = bX + c
&lt;/math&gt;

The question is then, what is y (your dependent variable) and what is x (your independent variable)

In the example spreadsheet

&lt;math&gt;
Y=LN(Passengers/(K-Passengers))
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
X=Year
&lt;/math&gt;


The Derivation is given on the spreadsheet.

The number of passengers is known from the data, as is the year. (LN is the natural log function).  K however is unknown in this case (High Speed Rail is not yet fully mature, traffic volumes are not saturated).  Thus a number of regressions, with various trials for K were done.

The goodness of fit of the model is explained by the R-squared and the t-statistic.  You want an R-squared close to 1.0, but are unlikely to get an exact value.  You want t-statistics on your estimated variables to be as high as possible, and generally higher than 2 (which indicates the variable is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level). 

The constant term, along with the coefficient on the independent variable give you your t0.

=== Qualitative ===

# Describe the mode.  What are its essential technological characteristics, its main advantages, and its main markets.
# Set the scene prior to the advent of the mode.  What other modes were available? What were their limitations? How were markets for transportation evolving?  How did these factors stir interest in new possibilities?
# Describe the invention of the mode / technology.  What different types of technological expertise were brought together? How?  How was the shift from the initial design altered in the face of early experience? Describe the shift from the initial technology to the predominant technology.  Remember that technology refers both to hardware (physical artifacts) and software (the way the artifacts are used to produce transportation).
# Describe early market development.  What were the initial market niches?  What roles did functional enhancement (serving existing markets better) and functional discovery (serving new markets) play in market development?
# Assess the role of policy in the birthing phase.  Describe how policies from precursor models were borrowed, and how other policies were innovated.  Identify policies that were embedded and policies that were imposed or sanctioned by government.  Identify policies that were &quot;locked in&quot; during this time.
# Describe the growth of the mode.  What roles did the public and private sectors play in the growth?  What policy issues arose, and how were they resolved?  How did the policy environment influence policymaking in this period.
# Describe development during the mature phase of the mode.  Describe attempts to adapt the mode changing markets, competitive conditions, and policy values.  Describe how &quot;lock-in&quot; has constrained these adaptations.  Identify any opportunities you see to &quot;re-invent&quot; the mode so that it can better serve the needs of today and tomorrow.

=== Comments: ===

# All analysis should be in SI (metric) units if appropriate.
# All research should be properly cited in a standard bibliographic format.  All writing should be original, with sparing use of quotes from other sources.  Plagiarism will result in an &quot;F&quot;. 
# A complete history of any technology or mode is the work of a doctoral dissertation, not a term paper.  Be as complete and as thorough as possible in the time and space allowed; your instructor understands the constraints you face.
# Start early, last minute work shows.  This is a large assignment, pace accordingly.
# Your word processor has spelling and grammar checkers, use them.  Attention to detail in writing and presentation is important to persuade the reader you have attended to detail in the analysis.  Get a classmate to proofread your work if you have trouble doing so yourself.
# If you have any questions, email or see your instructor, he is happy to help and read and comment on preliminary drafts. 
# You are free to talk to classmates about the assignment, but your work must be your own.
# Visit (yes, physically visit) the library. Use multiple reference sources, preferably primary sources, including web and at least 5 non-web sources. Do not use or cite online encyclopedias as primary sources (although they are fine to read and get ideas from). Cite references as appropriate in the text. Cite also the source for your data when you present your data.

==Form==

For Plato, human beings live in a world of visible and intelligible things. The visible world is what surrounds us: what we see, what we hear, what we experience. The visible world is full of objects that are primarily influenced by other local objects. Asteroids colliding in another galaxy do not cause us to sneeze. Local objects cause each other to change and this causes uncertainty. 

Intelligible things or objects can be understood. Plato believed that everything can be understood. We may not understand it now. Understanding means unchanging human reasoning. Anything arising from reason alone, such as abstract definitions or mathematics, makes up this intelligible world. This is reality. The intelligible world contains eternal &quot;Forms&quot; (in Greek, idea) of things. The visible world is the imperfect and changing manifestation in this world of these unchanging forms. For example, the &quot;Form&quot; or &quot;Idea&quot; of a horse is intelligible, abstract, and applies to all horses. The Horse Form never changes, even though horses vary wildly among themselves—the Horse Form would never change even if every horse in the world were to vanish. An individual horse is a physical, changing object that can easily cease to be a horse (if, for instance, it's dropped out of a fifty story building); the Form of a horse, or &quot;horseness,&quot; never changes. As a physical object, a horse only makes sense in that it can be referred to the &quot;Form&quot; or &quot;Idea&quot; of horseness.

For more, read this wikipedia [[wikipedia:Theory_of_Forms|form]] article.

==Function==

A google search of Form and Function does not result in a link to greek philosophy. Notice all the links claiming form and function are advertisements claiming:

*beauty
*feel
*no need for a manual
*obvious how it works 

Most expect form and function to be related. Marketing and sales almost require them to be related in an obvious way. Anything too new, (unique form) may never sell even if it is the best thing since [[:w:Sliced_bread|sliced bread]]. 

There is another whole world of special products that engineers sell other engineers, scientists and technicians. These products may be kludgy, they may not be elegant. They may be puzzles of function. When is it necessary to make a combination of buttons, knobs, and software something a four year old can understand? When is it time to evolve the product's function rather than it's form?

== Linear Algebra ==

Hi!

I seen that you are assessing Linear Algebra and have contributed to it. It's quite good! Thank you for your contributions!

Yet, I think that I have spotted two flaws that I'd like to draw your attention to. I've posted them on the discussion pages:

[[Talk:Linear_Algebra/Strings]], [[Talk:Linear Algebra/General = Particular + Homogeneous]] and [[Talk:Linear Algebra/Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors]].

I'd be very grateful if you could take a look at my short remarks. [[User:Wisapi|Wisapi]] ([[User talk:Wisapi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wisapi|contribs]]) 19:28, 3 August 2011 (UTC)
:Well, my specialty is not mathematics.  I just performed general cleanup.  I see that you've already posted on Thenub314's talk page, which is good, as that's the person I'd recommend discussing it with. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:12, 4 August 2011 (UTC)
== High School Chemistry ==

Hello. It appears that you were the last person to do any editing to [[High School Chemistry|this particular book]]. I am not sure if you were heavily involved in the project or not, but it appears to be abandoned. I would like to adopt this book for a potential Wikiversity course. However, this would likely entail significant changes to the book, but I wanted to make sure that this was not a project of yours and, if not, if the original authors even have any interest anymore. Thanks! [[User:Topher385|Topher385]] ([[User talk:Topher385|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Topher385|contribs]]) 00:29, 5 August 2011 (UTC)

:This book is effectively abandoned. The content was copied from ck12 before they changed their license to a non-commercial variant of the Creative Commons Sharealike license, which was not compatible with Wikibooks (some discussion [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2010/October#Five-year_WMF_targets here] on this). AS such I think you should just adopt it if you want to and change the scope as required &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 12:13, 5 August 2011 (UTC)

:Well, certainly neglected.  I meant to at some point take the content from [[:File:High School Chemistry.pdf]], which was downloaded prior to the license change (Creative Commons licenses are irrevocable), and transcribe it to the wiki, but it's a lot of work to do this (at least for mathematics books), and it's hard to justify the time input for the number of people that now make use of Wikibooks, especially because CK-12 is hosting a competing version that can no longer have any updates made to it reflected here.  Refactoring the book would mean that the associated PDF would not be made use of should work resume on transcription in the future.  Have you taken a look at the PDF?  Would its content and structure be useful as an additional resource?  If so, then it might be preferable to use a slightly altered title for the book you have in mind. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:50, 5 August 2011 (UTC)

:The PDF files would make great resources for a high school level textbook.  Would it be preferable to use modify the existing book or simply start a new one from scratch? [[User:Topher385|Topher385]] ([[User talk:Topher385|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Topher385|contribs]]) 21:13, 5 August 2011 (UTC)

::I created the first page for [[High School Chemistry]] to show what the appearance looks like for a good import from the PDF.  The mathematics books from CK-12 take all day for one lesson, in that they require writing in [[LaTeX]] and the diagrams have to be created from scratch in SVG.  I think it would be easier to start a new one from scratch since the infrastructure for this particular book is already set up for the PDF, you feel the PDF is a good resource that can be made use of, I find that transcription for the non-mathematics books goes fairly quickly, and finally because it would be good to avoid adding complexity to your efforts.  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:34, 5 August 2011 (UTC)
== Language tags double quoted? ==

You are making an automatic correction for the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=...&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; template. If &lt;code&gt;XX&lt;/code&gt; is not in a double quote, you are adding it automatically. It is not worth the resources, though, as it works with and without double quotes the same. You may make a comparison in the sandbox, if you wish. [[User:Sae1962|Sae1962]] ([[User talk:Sae1962|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sae1962|contribs]]) 11:31, 10 August 2011 (UTC)

You continue to make these (automated?) modification to my pages by modifying the language to &quot;language&quot;. Please &lt;u&gt;stop it&lt;/u&gt;! [[User:Sae1962|Sae1962]] ([[User talk:Sae1962|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sae1962|contribs]]) 08:02, 11 August 2011 (UTC)
:You are using invalid code, despite it working correctly.  See HTML versus XHTML.  I am free to correct it to match the recommended syntax as described by the developer and in line with XHTML's enclosure of parameters in quotes.  We must encourage proper syntax by future contributors looking over the code and as you've described above, it results in the same output.  This shouldn't even be an issue.  Would you take just as much offense if I changed all the &lt;tt&gt;source&lt;/tt&gt; tags to &lt;tt&gt;syntaxhighlight&lt;/tt&gt;, because &lt;tt&gt;source&lt;/tt&gt; has been deprecated for the extension because it conflicts with an XML tag? &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:19, 11 August 2011 (UTC)

Thenub314, checkuser and 'crat here, seems to have no edits anywhere for almost two months, and hasn't responded to my email.

We don't really have the environment you see at WP where it's constant whack-a-mole and seemingly the sockpuppeteers get a kick out of harassing administrators.  As far as I'm aware, administrative coverage is adequate.  It's general participation we can always use more of. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 03:34, 22 August 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Matrix stack */ kazmath--correct name and moved</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">OpenGL ES 2.0 has most of OpenGL 1.x just not available, and OpenGL 3.x and OpenGL 4.x deprecate it (the feature are still available in the &quot;compatibility profile&quot;, but you can expect the features to disappear soon enough).

However, little is said about how these features are replaced in the new versions.  Here's how:

= Matrix stack =

Deprecated functions: glIdentity, glRotate, glOrtho, gluOrtho...

Matrix maths can be done:

* in the shaders, using build-in operators
* in the C source code using additional libraries such as:
** GLM - http://glm.g-truc.net/
** Kazmath - https://code.launchpad.net/~kazmath-developers/kazmath/trunk
** libSIMDx86 - http://simdx86.sourceforge.net/

GLM provides glm::ortho to replace glOrtho and gluOrtho for orthographic perspectives (and 2D programming).

Examples:
* [[../Modern_OpenGL_Tutorial_05|Tutorial 05]]: cube rotation

= Vertex and texture =

Deprecated functions: glVertex, glTexCoord...

These data are now sent in batch mode, as C arrays. You can use:
* directly a C array : data is resent a each frame
* glBufferData : send the C data once to the graphic card, then refer to the buffer

You use glVertexAttribPointer, once time for each vertex attribute (position, color, texture coordinate...), passing it the C array or OpenGL buffer.

Examples:
* [[../Modern_OpenGL_Introduction|Tutorial 01]]: introduction (C arrays, no buffer)
* [[../Modern_OpenGL_Tutorial_04|Tutorial 04]]: cube (elements)

Then you use glDrawArrays or glDrawElements to start drawing.

= Normals =

Deprecated functions: glNormal, glNormalPointer

Normals need to be passed to the shaders (namely for shading computations), like vector coordinates (glVertexAttribPointer).
To compute the normal of 3 vertices a, b and c in counter-clockwise order, GLM provides:
 glm::normalize(glm::cross(b - a, c - a));
 glm::fastNormalize(glm::cross(b - a, c - a));  // faster but less accurate

Examples:
* [[../Modern_OpenGL_Tutorial_Load_OBJ|Tutorial 08]]: load .obj, computing normals on the fly

= Evaluators - Bezier curves and surfaces =

Deprecated functions: glMap1, glMap2, glEvalCoord, glEvalPoint...

* GLU ES - http://code.google.com/p/glues/ - this is for OpenGL 1.x, so it may not work in a 2.x environment, but provides replacement code
* Manual code (not that hard)

Examples:
* [[../Modern_OpenGL_Tutorial_07|Tutorial 07]]: teapot (Bézier surfaces)

= Lighting =

Deprecated functions: glLight (glLightfv3, etc.), glShadeModel...

The bad news is that you have to reimplement everything in the shaders.
The good news is that it's not ''so'' hard, plus you have copy/pasteable code in the examples below :)

You also need to make the light parameters available to your shaders, and it's best to store them as a shader &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;.

Examples:
* [[GLSL_Programming/GLUT/Diffuse Reflection|Diffuse Reflection]]
* Other parts of the lighting tutorials

      <comment>Notice about Wikijunior edits and {{subst:joinus}}</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi,  Thank you for your contributions.  Below are some tips and information about Wikibooks and the benefits of joining.  Please be aware that your recent edits [[Wikijunior:World War II/Franklin Roosevelt]] were made to a Wikijunior book.  Although the content of your contributions is fine you will need to simplify, reduce and alter the text somewhat for the target audience.  Wikijunior books are written for kids so it's important that the language used is suitable for kids.

==Welcome!==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Pronunciation of Regular (+ed) Verb Endings ==

In English, the past simple form of regular verbs end in '''ed'''.
* play -&gt; play'''ed'''
* shout -&gt; shout'''ed'''
* cry -&gt; cr'''ied'''

There are '''3 possible pronunciations''' of the suffix (ending) ''ed'':
# /d/ - the most common form, pronounced simple ''d'' (example: played)
# /t/ - common for some verbs whose final letter is '''k''', '''p''', '''ch''' or '''sh''' (example: kicked, stopped, watched, washed)
# /id/ - not very common but many foreign learners of English use this pronunciation for all verbs.  Don't!.  It is used after verbs ending with a '''d''' and '''t''' sounds (example: decided, congratulated)

So I don't understand how in en.wikibooks that does not happen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Enumerators, Ranges, Arrays and Hashes===
Each of these can use the ''each'' method for iteration, though they seems to be synonyms, there is lot of difference in computing, The [[Wikipedia:Iterator|Enumerators and Ranges]] are almost of fixed memory length and so are memory efficient and fast, whereas [[Wikipedia:Array|Arrays]] and [[Wikipedia:Hash table|Hashes]] involves complex [[Wikipedia:Data structure|data structures]] for to be dynamic 
====Enumerators====
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
5.times.class       # =&gt; Enumerator
5.upto(10).class    # =&gt; Enumerator
5.upto(10).next     # =&gt; 5
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
====Ranges====
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
(0...10).class    # =&gt; Range
(0..9).class      # =&gt; Range
(1..5).next       # invalid, Range class doesent have next method
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
====Arrays====
An [[Wikipedia:Array|array]] is a collection of elements, by default an array of ''n'' elements has its '''index''' enumerated from ''0'' to ''n-1'', i.e, the index to the first element of an array is ''0''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
a = [4,6,7,5]    # simple array decleration 
a.length         # =&gt; 4
a.sort           # =&gt; [4, 5, 6, 7]
a.sort.reverse   # =&gt; [7, 6, 5, 4]
a[0]             # =&gt; 4
a[3]             # =&gt; 5
a[4] = 3         # =&gt; 3 ;resulting array is [4, 6, 7, 5, 3]
a[10] = 0        # =&gt; 0 ;resulting array is [4, 6, 7, 5, 3, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, 0]
a.length         # =&gt; 11
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
array of ranges are allowed to declare, Object Oriented!
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
HEX = [(0..9),('A'..'F')]
HEX.each { |x| x.each { |y| print y }}    # outputs, 0123456789ABCDEF
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
====Hashes====
[[Wikipedia:Hash table|Hash]] is an [[Wikipedia:Associative array|associative array]] which is a collections of '''Keys''' and it's associated '''Values'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
capitals = {                  
:karnataka  =&gt; 'Banglore'
:maharastra =&gt; 'Mumbai'
}
capitals[:westbengal] = 'Kolkata'     # append a new element
capitals[:karnataka] = 'Bengaluru'    # change an element's association
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
print '%d%' % 1     # is valid, =&gt; 1%
print '%d% ' % 1    # is invalid 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
