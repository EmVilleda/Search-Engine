      <text xml:space="preserve">==North America==
[[Image:NativeAmericanRegions map 1.jpg|right|thumb|450px|A map showing the 12 cultural groups of North and Central America.]]
The first people to settle North America are thought to have crossed over from Asia during the last '''Ice Age''' (roughly 15,000 years ago).  Around this time, huge amounts of water froze into glaciers, the Bering Strait between Siberia and Alaska drained, and a wide, low, treeless plain called Beringia connected the two continents.  The '''paleo-Indians''' moved south through a corridor between the ice sheets to settle the prairies.  By 11,000 BC they had reached the southern tip of South America.  By this time, significant hunting activities were taking place in North America and many large mammals, such as the woolly mammoth, may have become extinct as a result of hunting and climate change.  Once humans were established in Central America, they quickly became more sedentary, simple village structures evolving within a small time frame into far more complex societies.  The archaeological evidence left by the Olmec and Zapotec in Central America, and the burial mounds of the Adena and Hopewell of the American Southeast reveal sophisticated societies.
 
===The Early Hunter-Gatherers===
The earliest peoples of North and Central America banded together in egalitarian, extended-family groups, living by hunting and gathering. They eventually become specialized and adapted to the continent's various ecological niches: plains, mountains, deserts, woodlands, river valleys, and coastal areas.  Specifically, adapted spear points and other weaponry reveal the major prey species in different culture areas.  The fine '''&quot;Clovis&quot;''' spearheads were used by plains hunters to kill bison, barbed harpoon heads were developed by coastal peoples for spearing marine creatures, and stone-tipped darts were thrown by the basin and mountain dwellers at the wildfowl which provided them with the bulk of their diet. 

===The First Farmers===
Agriculture in North America emerged only gradually but proved revolutionary in its impact.  Animal husbandry was largely absent, with only a few animals truly domesticated.  Dogs, honeybees, and turkeys were the first animals to be domesticated in the Americas. In Central America, a few plants were cultivated as a supplement to hunting and gathering as early as 5000 BCE and new plants - especially corn, beans, and squash - were brought under cultivation and soon offered a more secure food source.  Hunting bands became seasonally sedentary and then semi-sedentary, until between 2500 and 1400 BCE, when Central America was dominated by settled horticultural villages.  Further north, the earliest crops served initially as supplements rather than as staples.  Agriculture gradually became more important throughout the first millennium CE, with villagers becoming largely agricultural by the beginning of the second millennium.

===Early Civilizations of Central America===
With the establishment of village life, the earliest complex settlements occurred in the tropical lowlands from the Gulf of Mexico across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to the Pacific coast of present-day Guatemala.  Increasingly sophisticated societies were made possible by new crops and productive soils.  The Olmec civilization emerged on the Gulf Coast c. 1500 BCE and flourished until c. 400 BCE.  Slightly later than the Olmec, the Valley of Oaxaca witnessed the development of a sophisticated society, and by 500 BCE, complex chiefdoms or early states dominated the three valleys of central Oaxaca. At their juncture, the Zapotec built the hilltop city of Monte Alban which would dominate the region for over a millennium.  In the highlands south of Yucatan, the Maya civilization was starting to emerge as early as 1000 BCE.

===The Moundbuilders of the Eastern River Valleys===
The Adena culture was found in the upper Ohio valley as early as 1000 BCE.  Settlements were centered on burial mounds and extensive earthworks.  Their grave goods included jewelry made from imported copper, carved tablets, and tubular pipes - which provide evidence of the early cultivation of tobacco.  The Hopewell culture had emerged by c. 100 CE, and spread throughout the Mississippi Valley, sustained by small-scale agriculture.  They created a complex and far-reaching trade network to source the many raw materials - including obsidian, mica, quartz, shells, teeth, and copper - used in their characteristic animal and bird sculptures.  Elements of Hopewell culture appear to have been adopted by many other Indian groups.

==South America==
[[Image:Southamerica culture map 1.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Map showing the Native culture regions of South America]]
South America was colonized by settlers from the north, possibly more than 13,000 years ago.  By 10,000 BCE, hunter-gatherers had reached its southern tip.  By 5000 BCE, communities were beginning to exploit local resources, such as corn, manioc, and potatoes.  Successful agriculture led to growing populations and increasingly stratified societies.  The distinctive temple mounds of Peru appeared by c.2500 BCE, and characteristic elements of South American religious iconography were disseminated from the Chavin culture in c.1200 BCE.  By 300 CE, Peru was dominated by two major civilizations: the Nazca and the Moche.

===The Earliest Settlements===
The first South American settlers were hunter-gatherers, exploiting the big game which flourished following the last Ice Age.  Spearheads and arrowheads indicate that this way of life had reached the far south of the continent by 10,000 BCE.  In Chile, the site of Monte Verde reveals timber huts draped with animal hides by 11,000 BCE.  Finds of medicinal plants, potato peelings, digging sticks, wooden bowls, and mortars, show an intimate knowledge of plant resources which supplemented a diet of small game and mastodon.

The first farmers of South America were located on the northern Pacific coast.  Corn, the staple crop of the Americas, was cultivated in Ecuador c.6000 BCE; and the major high-altitude crop in the Andes, the potato, may have been grown by 4000 BCE.  Llamas and alpaca, domesticated for their wool, were used as Andean pack animals.  Manioc, which became a staple of tropical forest farmers, was cultivated in the Amazon Basin by 3000 BCE.

===The Peoples of the Amazon Basin and Atlantic Coast===
Rock shelters and flaked stone tools dating to c.10,000 BCE provide the earliest evidence of settlement east of the Andes.  The transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture probably began c.3000 BCE.  Large shell middens at the mouths of the Amazon and Orinoco rivers contain remains of pottery dating to c.5000 BCE, far earlier than the first pottery of Peru.  When corn was introduced into the river flood plains in the first millennium BCE, populations expanded and hierarchical societies developed.  Drainage earthworks in some areas suggest large populations were cooperating to farm the landscape.

===The Early Cultures of Peru===
The most influential culture of the Andes at this time was that of the Chavin, which flourished at and around the major religious center of Chavin de Huantar between 850 BCE and 200 BCE.  The Chavin were distinguished by the sophistication of their architecture and sculptural style and by technological developments including the building of canals.  As Chavin influence waned, many distinctive regional cultures developed in the Andean highlands.  Coastal Peru, however, was dominated by two major civilizations, the Nazca in the south, and Moche in the north.  As these cultures developed a strong identity, military rivalries intensified, paving the way for the appearance of other major states to come.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dewikify}}
An '''X-ray image intensifier''' (XRII), sometimes referred to as  a ''C-arm'' or ''[[fluoroscope]]'' in medical settings, is an imaging device which uses [[X-ray]]s and produces a live image feed which is displayed on a TV screen.

The term [[image intensifier]] refers to a special component of the machine, which allows low intensity X-rays to be amplified, resulting in a smaller dose to the patient. The overall system consists of an X-ray source, input window, input [[phosphor]], [[photocathode]], vacuum and [[electron]] [[optics]], output phosphor and output window. It allows for lower X-ray doses to be used on patients by magnifying the intensity produced in the output image while enabling the viewer to easily see the structure of the object being imaged. They were introduced by [[Philips]] in [[1955]].

==Clinical applications==
An image intensifier (II) is used in two ways:

*As a fixed piece of equipment in a dedicated screening room
*Mobile equipment for use in an [[operating theatre]]
[[Image:Philips II.jpg|thumb|right|Fixed X-ray image intensifier]]

==Components==
*C-arm (encompasses the actual X-ray source and image intensifier)
*Table
*Radiographic exposure and program controls
*Post processing software
*Viewing monitors

===Fixed image intensifiers===
These are used in most X-ray departments as 'screening rooms'. The types of investigations for which this machine can be used for is vast, including:
*Barium studies (swallows, meals, enemas)
*Endoscopy studies ([[ERCP]])
*Fertility studies ([[Hysterosalpingography|HSG]])
*Angiography studies (peripheral, central and cerebral)
*Therapeutic studies (Line placements i.e. ''Permacath''/''Hickman'', transjugular biopsies, TIPS stent, embolisations)
*Cardiac studies ([[PTCA]])
*Orthopedic procedures (ORIF, DHS, MUA, spinal work)

==Mobile image intensifiers==

'''General configuration and range of movements'''

A mobile image intensifier generally consists of two units, the intensifier unit and the television or workstation unit. The intensifier unit consists of a C-arm with a variety of movements that allows for use in a variety of surgical procedures such as cardiology, orthopedics and urology. The C-arm has an image intensifier and an X-ray tube positioned directly opposite from each other. The c-arm is capable of many movements:
*Horizontal travel: about 200&amp;nbsp;mm
*Orbital travel: about 115 degrees
*Motorized vertical travel: 460&amp;nbsp;mm
*Wig-wag about +/-12&amp;nbsp;cm (entire C-Arm and Image Intensifier)
*C-arm rotation about the horizontal axis +/- 210 degrees

The c-arm must be compact and lightweight to allow easy positioning with adequate space to work around and a wide range of motion.

'''Workstation unit'''

Much of the operation of the machine is from the workstation unit.  This has the following features:
*Various handles for movement and positioning
*Power switch and exposure switch
*Cable hanger
*Brake pedal
*Controls for radiographic and fluoroscopic settings
*Various interconnect cables
*Hard disk and optical disk writer/rewriter
*DVD R/RW
*[[PACS]] system connection allowing access to patient information, annotation,
*Advanced image quality enhancement software such as noise reduction, zoom control
*Ability to save and swap images between monitors
*Contrast and brightness controls
*May have one or dual 17&amp;nbsp;inch or larger monitors
*Advanced image processing such as noise reduction

'''Types of X-ray tube'''

Two types of X-ray tube may be fitted, fixed anode or rotating anode.
Typical features of fixed anode tubes include:
*Typical anode heat capacity load  30,000 - 50,000 heat units
*Single or dual focused anode, with 0.5 by 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm focal spot for fluroscopic applications and
1.8 by 1.8&amp;nbsp;mm focal spot size for radiographic applications. 
*The angle on the anode target of about 12 degrees.
Typical features of rotating anode tubes include:
*0.3&amp;nbsp;mm focal spot for better image detail
*Typical anode heat rating of 300 000 heat units for longer exposure times
*Allows for a longer tube life

The housing also has a heat storage limitation, typically 1200-1250kHU 

&lt;ref&gt;OEC-DIASONICS, series 9400, date: 12/1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Product Brochure, Philips Medical Systems&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electronic capabilities'''

The images can be manipulated in many ways on the computer screen.
Examples of this are:
*Cine loop replay-  Allows review of a dynamic scene without extra dose
*Cine Loop editing-  Shorter loops can be made over review of a dynamic scene
*16 Picture overview-  For quick overview.
*Zoom-  Fast magnification.
*Relative stenosis measurement- Can measure the distance of two vessels for vasuclar procedures.
*Test Annotation- To label all images

'''Generator and range of exposures'''

Modern systems use a digital high frequency generator with typically 20,000 cycles per second.  The range of kVp settings may be from 40kV to 110kV.  The tube current is typically 0.1mA to 6mA for fluoroscopy examinations. For radiographic mode the mA is fixed at about 20mA to 60mA.  mAs values vary from 0.16 to 160 for radiographic application.  The electronic timer varies from 0.1sec to 4.0sec for radiographic exposures. 

'''Image intensifiers, size and features'''

They may be fitted with a range of different types of image intensifiers; typically 16&amp;nbsp;cm or 22&amp;nbsp;cm.

Typical specifications for a 16&amp;nbsp;cm intensifier are:

*Maximum resolution is 44 lp/cm at the centre of the screen.
*Anti-scatter grid of 8:1, focused at 90&amp;nbsp;cm.
*Removable cassette holder that is mounted on the image intensifier and holds a 24X30 film.
*Rotation 360 degrees

Typical specifications for a 22&amp;nbsp;cm intensifier are:

*Resolution is 44 lp/cm at the centre of the screen.
*Magnification mode - allows a maximum resolution of 51 lp/cm at the centre of the screen
*Stationary anti-scatter grid 10:1, focused at 90&amp;nbsp;cm.
*Removable cassette holder that is mounted on the image intensifier and holds a 24X30 film.
*Rotation 360 degrees

'''Flat detectors - image intensifier replacement'''

Flat Detectors are currently offered by [http://www.ziehm.com Ziehm Imaging] and Philips Medical [http://www.medical.philips.com/main/products/xray/products/c_arms/veradus/index.wpd/ Philips Medical]. The Flat Detector (FD) will replace the Image Intensifier. The advantages of this technology include lower patient dose and increased image quality because the x-rays are always pulsed, and no deterioration of the image quality over time.

'''Type of TV camera and coupling to II'''

Older machines may have a vidicon type pickup tube, with direct fiber-optic coupling to the image intensifier.  Modern machines may have a CCD camera.

'''Radiation safety features'''

*Last image hold, &quot;freezing&quot; the screen and availing for examining the screen without exposing the patient to unnecessary radiation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walterrobinson.com/images/Walt_PPT/ppt_pres/sld044.htm walterrobinson.com &gt; Last Image Hold Feature] Retrieved on April 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pulsed fluroscopy
*Single pulse fluroscopy mode
*Manual mode in order to reduce dose (ALARA)
*Fluoroscopy timer warning
*Movements of II allow distance between patient and image detector low, so therefore reducing dose to patient.
*Beam limitation devices to minimize beam area

'''Special features'''
*Real time viewing
*Remote control keypad
*Removable cassette holder, for both fluroscopy and plain film images
*Contrast correction
*Zoom
*Edge enhancement
*Digital subtraction
*Wheels fitted with cable deflectors

'''3D imaging'''

Used for CT like imaging in the operating theatre environment.
*3D Navigation
*Checking post surgical screw placement
See 
*[http://www.ziehm.com Ziehm Imaging]
*[http://www.medical.siemens.com/ Siemens Healthcare]

'''Potential radiation safety issues'''

Failure of the x-ray beam collimation may lead to primary beam x-ray exposure outside of the image intensifier housing, potentially irradiating personnel.  If the c-arm or fittings are damaged, the x-ray tube and intensifier may become misaligned, also leading to the potential for direct irradiation of personnel.

==Technical capabilities==

Image intensifiers are usually set up for two purposes.  For either plain fluoroscopy or [[digital subtraction angiography]] (DSA).  All image intensifiers are set up with software capable of adjusting settings to suit different user requirements, depending on the procedure and body area being imaged.  In simple flouroscopy for example, imaging of the throat would not require the same amount of exposure as that of the abdomen.  And on DSA capable models, preset programs are available which enables the user to decide a rate of how many images or frames per second are acquired.

==Future developments==

*Flat panel
*Dual head
*Low dose Imaging
*Flat detector currently offered by Ziehm Imaging [http://www.ziehm.com] and Philips Medical [http://www.medical.philips.com/main/products/xray/products/c_arms/veradius/index.wpd/ Philips Medical]. The flat detector will replace the image intensifier. The advantages of this technology include lower patient dose and increased image quality because the X-rays are always pulsed.

I am working on the section about determinants, but I find this difficult to do without the concepts of rank and matrix inverses.  I would like to take this project on, but I think I need to do a lot of reorganizing.  Please let me know if there are any objections to this.--Mike
---------

I was going to turn this into my next project, but then I realized it took me forever to do something in latex when I could write down on a piece of paper in 5 seconds. I gave up after writing the first section of the first chapter, which was exetremly short and still took me 2 hours. -Ghostal

----

Perhaps it would be a good idea to create pages specifically for linear algebra, rather than linking to the algebra ones? Then one can get further in depth with linear algebra concepts w/o confusing algebra students. I doubt anyone will mind since this project seem[ed] abandoned [as of 2005], but I don't want to start a flame war either (is a wikibooks n00b).

== A new direction ==

I am a college student and has just finished studying linear Algebra I and II.  I have found in my own studies, as well as teaching other students that geometric interpretations are the best way to introduce linear algebra concepts.  It seems that this book tries to ''shove'' the math at the students without trying to ''teach'' it to them.--[[User:Jon513|Jon513]] 12:28, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

== Reorganization ==

I sugests a total reorganization of this book. It isn't very descriptive and does not explain things, it just gives out a lot of information but much of it does not make sense because of the lacking explanation. And I would suggest this book follow the outline provided by Whiteknight at his [[User:Whiteknight/Algebra#Linear_Algebra|user page]]. If nobody from the community objects I will start working on the outline provided by Whiteknight, during next week, the first I'm going to change are the TOC. But if somebody has objections please say so... --[[User:Xharze|Xharze]] 09:18, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

:Thank you! I am very happy to find people who are willing to help with this project. I've been so busy lately that I just haven't had the time to actually fix this book and make it good. Please let me know if you need any help with this, I would love to help out any way I can. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:22, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

::Just happy to help. I was thinking about starting the change today, as you have given the community a week to object and as far as I can see nobody has... So I'm starting to change the TOC today, and I hope it won't be a problem. --[[User:Xharze|Xharze]] 09:18, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

:::Please do! thank you for helping with this project! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:08, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

== Change of Basis ==

I just added the Change of Basis section; if anyone has any criticism (which I'm sure there could be), please feel free to edit! - Évariste 27 June 2007 6:00 PM

== Current Development of This Book as of 8/07 ==

Is anyone using this or developing further this book? I will be teaching a web course in the subject this fall and may wish to use parts of this.

George Dorner
george@dorners.net

== New table of contents==

I am planning to further develop this book in the coming days. Firstly here is my plan for the new table of contents (1st 3 chapters) as I think that the current one contains many double entries and does not have an appropriate flow.

:#Chapter 1:Linear Equations
::*Matrices 
::*Invertible matrices
::*Elementary row transformations
::*Row reduced echelon matrices
::*Systems of linear equations

:#Chapter 2:Vector Spaces
::*Vector spaces and subspaces
::*Linear dependence and independence
::*Bases and dimensions
::*Null spaces
::*Row and column spaces
::*Coordinates
::Application:Interpolation
::Application:The Wronskian

:#Chapter 3:Linear Transformation
::*Linear transformations
::*The algebra of linear transformations
::*Isomorphism
::*Linear functionals
::*The double dual
::*The transpose of a linear transformation
 
This can be followed by chapters on determinants, canonical forms and inner product spaces etc. I am waiting for comments from anyone interested. Cheers--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] 16:54, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

== On vectors ==

I would like to remove all references to vectors as row or column matrices. They should be defined as elements of a vector space.--[[User:The Scarlet Letter|A]] ([[User talk:The Scarlet Letter|talk]]) 20:00, 9 December 2007 (UTC)

Moreover, I would like to base the whole book on Determinants. The logical dependence shall go like this:
Determinants-&gt;Rank-&gt;Linear Dependance (vector space introduced here)-&gt;Dimension-&gt;Linear Transformations-&gt;Matrices (since their operations are based upon linear transformations, especially multiplication)-&gt;Range, Null space-&gt;Invariant space-&gt;Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors-&gt;... 
Where dimension and linear dependence play a role in the general solution of a system of m linear equations of n variables.--[[User:The Scarlet Letter|A]] ([[User talk:The Scarlet Letter|talk]]) 02:31, 10 December 2007 (UTC)

:Good idea. I think that proofs of many theorems can be added to [[The Book of Mathematical Proofs]] to avoid the flow of the book becoming tedious.--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] ([[User talk:Shahab|talk]]) 05:22, 11 December 2007 (UTC)

==New Book==
The uploaded new book is far superior to our existing linear algebra book. If there are no specific objections we should start the process of deleting/merging/redirecting the old pages as per their individual content. Basically only those pages which have topics not present in the new book should be retained. Meanwhile I'll try to properly format the new book.--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] ([[User talk:Shahab|talk]]) 13:42, 13 March 2008 (UTC)
:Since no objections have been raised I am going to remove the old table of contents, move the old pages to the pages to be merged section and bring the new table of contents on the top. Our focus should be formatting the book, since most of the content is already there. Cheers--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] ([[User talk:Shahab|talk]]) 04:59, 19 March 2008 (UTC)

: I've started changing the LaTeX format to MathML format.  Going through the Determinant Property page, I noticed someone put the old content back in without fully reformatting the LaTeX.  It would probably be best to get a page down, and then merge old content. The &quot;new&quot;, unformatted content is rather hard to read, and it doesn't make sense to have the same material repeated on the new layout.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 23:49, 31 January 2009 (UTC)

== Order of presentation ==

In think that it would be in good order to be more cautious while incorporating a new book, in that the best process, instead of trashing the old and bringing in the new, and somehow trying to piece the old bits into the new one, is actually to carefully incorporate the new content.

In any case, while looking through the Linear Algebra book, I find it quite problematic to decide what order to present the following topics in: systems of linear equations, determinants and matrices, vector spaces, linear transformations. In a way, they are all quite dependent on the other. For example, systems of linear equations is dependent on some ideas on dimension, while the foundation determinants and matrices is in some way related to systems of linear equations. Systems of linear equations is also dependent on some ideas about vector spaces, due to dimension, and there is also the connection between determinants and matrices and vector spaces. But the theory of matrices is based on the theory of linear transformations, which in turn is based on vector spaces.

Thus, you get some kind of interdependency of these four topics. I favor the approach in Georgi E. Shilov's book, which introduces Determinants, and gets to matrices last as being based on linear transformations. There is a single drawback to this, and it is that it does not adequately explain the origin of the determinant. However, I think that explaining the origin of determinants could be quite cumbersome, and could be done later.--[[User:The Scarlet Letter|A]] ([[User talk:The Scarlet Letter|talk]]) 06:10, 1 August 2008 (UTC)
:OK but please to note that the donated Jim Hefferon's book didn't follow this sequence and so you might have to do some rewriting.--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] ([[User talk:Shahab|talk]]) 17:36, 2 August 2008 (UTC)
::I'll be sure to do that. Regards, [[User:The Scarlet Letter|A]] ([[User talk:The Scarlet Letter|talk]]) 23:38, 4 August 2008 (UTC)

Yes, I think we are still somehow in a state of confusion as regards to the organization of algebra-related materials. (The organization of analysis stuff seems adequate, if not perfect.) As for linear algebra, in particular, I don't know any standard order of presentation of introductory materials, and I don't have any concrete suggestion (at least yet), but here are some of my thoughts. There seems to be three ways to view linear algebra. (i) Linear algebra as a standalone topic, with applications in a number of math or non-math related fields (e.g., systems of linear equations or coding theory). (ii) Linear algebra as a part of abstract algebra; i.e., essentially a subtopic in module theory (in this line of thinking, Jordan forms appears very naturally), and (iii) Linear algebra as functional analysis on a finite-dimensional spaces. I assume this book follows the view of (i), because [[Abstract Algebra]] should have (ii), and [[Functional Analysis]] would contain some of (iii). Therefore, it makes sense if this book emphasizes motivation behind linear algebra and its applications--materials that are hard to include in Abstract Algebra and Functional Analysis. So, the book might start with a discussion of how to solve a system of linear equations, and then introduces matrices, determinants (which can tell if systems of equations has non-trivial solutions), and so forth.

I personally would like to see a non-freshman linear algebra book; something that discusses representation theory and, most importantly, symplectic geometry. But I guess this is something for the future. -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] ([[User talk:TakuyaMurata|talk]]) 13:44, 11 August 2008 (UTC)

Also, I am thinking that, in [[Functional Analysis]], it might make sense to have a chapter on linear algebra after &quot;Ch 3: Geometry of Banach spaces&quot; before a chapter on operator algebras and spectral theory, because some topics in operational theory are simply algebra, requiring no analysis. I am not sure about this yet though. -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] ([[User talk:TakuyaMurata|talk]]) 13:53, 11 August 2008 (UTC)

:In the above post, I didn't mention one important point: that is, who is the target audience of the book, or put in another manner, what are prerequisites for the book? I believe that this book should be  accessible to those with no prior exposure to either real-analysis or topology or even naive set-theory. Denoting the set of eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\sigma(T)&lt;/math&gt; might not be a good idea, for example, if this is the case. -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] ([[User talk:TakuyaMurata|talk]]) 12:42, 13 August 2008 (UTC)</text>

== Proposal ==
===Changes to the [[mw:Extension:FlaggedRevs|Flagged Revisions Extension]]===
Wikibooks uses the '''[[mw:Extension:FlaggedRevs|FlaggedRevs]]''' extension (also known as '''flagged revisions''' or '''pending changes''') so that ''reviewers'' can review page revisions. With the proposed changes:

Readers will not be impacted by reviews, unless administrators are asked by book contributors to have readers shown the latest reviewed revision of a specific quality.

Contributors can become reviewers one of two ways: by fulfilling the auto-promotion criteria or by a direct request at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]]. Auto-promotion will take into consideration work done in the main, Cookbook and Wikijunior namespaces.

Reviewers may classify page revisions for quality as ''minimal'', ''average'', or ''good''. Reviewed pages are said to be ''stable''.  None of the quality classifications will be accompanied by any type of comment. Any new page created by a reviewer will automatically get a quality classification of ''minimal''. 

Reviewers will also be granted rollback capability (able to revert large number of alterations by a single user).

No previous work done under the flagged revisions extension will be lost, as a developer will ensure that previous reviews on ''composition'' apply to ''quality'' instead.

;Quality criteria levels
*'''minimal''' - Proofread for spelling, punctuation, grammar, paragraph structure, and paragraph consistency.
*'''average''' - Checked that typography and language is consistent with the book's [[Wikibooks:Local manuals of style|local manual of style]].
*'''good''' - Thoroughly examined to ensure ideas/concepts are consistent, neutral, accurate, and cited.

;Reviewer auto-promotion criteria
* Pages in the main, Cookbook, and Wikijunior namespaces count as content pages, instead of just those in the main space. As a side effect more edits will count towards auto promotion for Reviewers and statistics will be more accurate.
*Have a registered account that is ''at least'' 30 days old, with an email set and confirmed in [[Special:Preferences]].
*Have never been blocked, and have never had the Reviewer tools removed (you can [[WB:RFP|request the tools]] in this case).
*Have ''at least'' 100 edits since registration (excluding deleted edits), in which:
**50 or more edits are to pages other than discussion pages, including edits to the main space, Cookbook, and Wikijunior.
**50 or more [[WB:ES|edit summaries]] are used.
**10 or more unique pages are edited ''at least'' once.
**8 edits are spaced 2 or more days apart from each other (which takes ''at least'' 18 days, if you edit every 2 days).
**5 or more edits are in [[Special:RecentChanges|recent changes]] at the time automatic Reviewer promotion is checked (this works out to be anytime in the past week).
* People sharing the same IP address can now be auto-promoted.

===Enabling [[mw:Extension:ReaderFeedback|Reader Feedback Extension]]===
The proposed adoption of this extension will allow for anyone to provide a rating of a page, without having to be a reviewer or even logging in. To view it in use, visit [http://en.labs.wikimedia.org/ en.labs.wikimedia.org] and at the bottom of the page you will see the interface for the extension.  This interface uses a menu system, but one using star graphics has been implemented at [[n:|Wikinews]].

Reader feedback will be enabled for pages in the main space, the Cookbook, and Wikijunior, where anyone (even unregistered users) may provide feedback at five levels for reliability, completeness, neutrality, and presentation.

Feedback totals are presented to the reader after submitting feedback, but a page will not be a member of the overall list of reader-rated pages until it receives feedback from at least five people.  Graphs are generated for each page showing feedback over the past 180 days.

===Changes to [[Special:ListGroupRights|Rights Management]]===
Flagged revisions replaces the new page patrol system in any namespace it is implemented in.  As it is enabled in all namespaces that use new page patrol, there is no longer any need for the Patroller group.

Those using the flagged revisions system are often required to handle vandalism and so, whether auto-promoted or assigned, reviewers will have the ability to roll back all of the last editor's edits to a page.  If this is abused, the tools will be removed and reviewer group membership will have to be requested at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]].  This will eliminate the need for a dedicated Rollbacker group.  To avoid confusion, the former Editor group will be what has been referred to up to this point as Reviewer and administrators will be able to continue to add or remove members from that group.

Additional user groups that have not been used up to this point will be made available for use. An Importer group will be enabled that allows members of the community ''that need it'' to bring in pages from other Wikimedia sites (such as Wikipedia) should an administrator add them to the group following discussion at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]].  For trusted members of the community that need to perform high-volume, non-controversial work for a short period of time, bureaucrats will be able to assign them the [[Wikibooks:Pseudo-bots|Pseudo-bot]] flag to hide their edits from recent changes.  For long-term work, a separate account and full discussion at [[WB:RFP]] will be needed for the [[Wikibooks:Bot|Bot]] flag instead.  To simplify things, the former Transwiki importer group will become the Importer group already mentioned.

===Enabling [[mw:Extension:AbuseFilter|Edit Filter Extension]]===
Because the flagged revisions extension removes new page patrol, and with this proposal allowing the most recent revision to be shown to readers by default (reviewed or not), an alternative is needed to limit the amount of vandalism shown to readers.  The adoption of the edit filter extension will permit some level of automation in protecting the project from clear-cut vandalism. 
 
Specific situations that are set by administrators will determine whether an action is performed to prevent damage to the project, known as a filter. A filter can result in one of the following: tagging of the edit in [[WB:PH]]/[[WB:RC|recent changes]], slowing the rate at which a user can edit for a period of time, displaying a warning to the user that their edit is undesired, or preventing a user from being auto-promoted to reviewer for a period of time. This system should not obstruct good-faith contributors and the filters will be transparently available for view by registered users who have had an account for four days, to prevent prospective vandals from getting around the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Georgia=

&lt;font size=3&gt;Georgia was a region of the former Soviet Union and became an independent republic in 1991. Meter stamps with former Soviet Union markings (“CCCP”, hammer &amp; sickle logo) are known, but stamps with Soviet inscriptions removed or with the new country name inscribed have not been reported. It is most likely that such stamps exist and we just do not know about them.&lt;/font&gt;

      <comment>/* Telescope Interface V2.0 */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This document describes the interface used by low-level telescope &quot;driver&quot; components as part of the Astronomy Common Object Model (ASCOM). Components that implement this interface can provide a way for programs to control various telescopes via a standard set of properties and methods. 

This specification covers a simple, low-level telescope control interface for reading and writing coordinates, slewing, synchronizing and access to common controller functions. It does not provide for accessories such as focusers, flip mirrors, etc. Those sorts of things will have their own interfaces. The characteristics of this interface comply with the ASCOM Quality Guidelines, assuring consistent behavior and compatibility with the widest possible variety of Windows Automation clients. 

In addition to containing features, the 2.0 specification has been clarified in numerous areas. These changes appear with this background color when they apply to existing V1 properties and methods. New properties and methods in V2.0 are not marked with the change color. For a summary of the changes and additions since the previous standard (Telescope 1.4), please refer to the Release Notes.

== Remarks ==
Use this interface to perform basic operations on a robotic telescope. It is designed to be used by client applications that wish to provide telescope control capabilities which are device-independent. By using this interface, your application will be freed from dealing with the details of serial port control and low-level protocols in use by various telescopes. 

== Discovery API ==

Not all of the features in this interface are required to be supported by all drivers and telescopes. This permits support for a wide range of telescope types without the evils of least-common-denominator designs. Telescope includes properties that permit discovery of supported features and supported ranges of motion rates. 

Many optional properties can be discovered by simply trying to read or set them. If a property is not supported, trying to read or set it will raise an exception, which you can trap. 

On the other hand, some features must be discovered by reading one of the Can___ properties, all of which must be supported. These are used to discover support for features (such as slewing capabilities) which would alter the state of the telescope if called directly for discovery. 

These Can___ properties are intended to declare only that the telescope supports the particular capability. They are not intended to reflect the current state of the telescope/mount. Furthermore, connecting to the telescope may be required in order to determine the capabilities to reflect in the Can___ properties (an error will be raised if a Can___ property is not available). Once connected, however, the Can___ properties must not change. 

Finally, the MoveAxis() method supports rate discovery. To discover the supported rates for this feature, a collection of Rate objects is provided. Each Rate object contains a maximum and minimum rate value. They may be equal, in which case the Rate object specifies a single discrete supported rate. The collections may contain more than one Rate object. Each specifies a range of rates or a single discrete rate. 

== Concurrency ==
This interface does not provide for concurrency control. In the interest of keeping things simple at this level, the architecture assumes that client applications will refrain from performing conflicting operations.

|A string containing only the major and minor version of the driver.This must be in the form &quot;n.n&quot;.  It should not to be confused with the See: P:ASCOM.DeviceInterface.ISafetyMonitor.InterfaceVersion property, which is the version of this specification supported by the   driver.
|-
!InterfaceVersion
|
|The interface version number that this device supports. Should return 1 for this interface version.Clients can detect legacy V1 drivers by trying to read ths property.  If the driver raises an error, it is a V1 driver. V1 did not specify this property. A driver may also return a value of 1.   In other words, a raised error or a return value of 1 indicates that the driver is a V1 driver.
|-
!Name
|
|The short name of the driver, for display purposes
|-
!SupportedActions
|
|Returns the list of action names supported by this driver. This is only available for telescope InterfaceVersion 3This method must return an empty arraylist if no actions are supported. Please do not throw a See: T:ASCOM.PropertyNotImplementedException.This is an aid to client authors and testers who would otherwise have to repeatedly poll the driver to determine its capabilities.   Returned action names may be in mixed case to enhance presentation but  will be recognised case insensitively in   the See: M:ASCOM.DeviceInterface.ISafetyMonitor.Action(System.String,System.String) method.An array list collection has been selected as the vehicle for  action names in order to make it easier for clients to  determine whether a particular action is supported. This is easily done through the Contains method. Since the  collection is also ennumerable it is easy to use constructs such as For Each ... to operate on members without having to be concerned   about hom many members are in the collection. Collections have been used in the Telescope specification for a number of years and are known to be compatible with COM. Within .NET  the ArrayList is the correct implementation to use as the .NET Generic methods are not compatible with COM.
|-
!IsSafe
|
|Indicates whether the monitored state is safe for use.

Ripper is a C-based Ruby parser available in MRI 1.9+

It parses ruby code into an AST, including comments.  YARD for example, uses it, as does the assert2 gem.

Note that there are some other ruby parsers available (some written in ruby), for example the Redparse gem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Some Merged pages==
I have merged [[Wikijunior:Biology/Kingdoms/Plants/Photosynthesis]] and [[Wikijunior:Biology/Kingdoms/Plants]].  But before [[Wikijunior:Biology/Kingdoms/Plants/Photosynthesis]] is deleted through a history merge, I thought I would check to see if any one objected.  Since history merges are irreversible. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 18:00, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

:It looks good to me.  Very natural.  Even the picture already present at plants goes well with photosynthesis.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 18:25, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

== Merging [[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Systems/Nervous system/Senses|Nervous system/Senses]] ==

I have, similarly, merged {{nowrap|[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Systems/Nervous system/Senses]]}} into {{nowrap|[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Systems/Nervous system]]}}, and similarly I haven't merged the histories yet because that's irreversible.  Just as Photosynthesis was the only subpage of a kingdom, Senses was the only subpage of a system; and because the image at Nervous system takes up so much more vertical space than the text, Senses fits in easily.  Does anyone object to this merge?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 21:23, 4 July 2010 (UTC)

:Seems like an excellent idea to me.  We should keep in mind this wikibook was recently imported from the Simple English wikibooks.  Probably we are safe to merge, but I will leave it for a little longer. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:17, 5 July 2010 (UTC)

::As long as the on-line book is in a consistent state, and the sidelined pages are in a self-evident state, there's no rush about it.  I've added tags to both sidelined pages so if anyone stumbles across them they'll know what's going on.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:08, 5 July 2010 (UTC)

== Evolution / origin of life ==

I started a new page on evolution and the [[wikijunior:Biology/Origin of Life|Origin of Life]] but I didn't want to add it to the ToC without some consensus and probably some more work to make it more worthy of the featured status of the rest of the book. --[[User:DoC352|DoC352]] ([[User talk:DoC352|talk]]) 19:09, 13 January 2011 (UTC)

==Where to put things==

The code on this page reflects more than just the configuration for flagged revisions.  If anything, this page and the root should be moved to a new name to document the changes Wikibooks has made to the basic configuration applied to all Wikimedia wikis.  Then use {{bad link|Wikibooks:Revision review}} to document the project-specific culture surrounding flagged revisions, with [[Help:Revision review]] covering the generic procedure on use of the extension. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:30, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

:I like the idea of a new page {{bad link|Wikibooks:Revision review}} complementing the existing [[Help:Revision review]], as you describe.

:Originally, page [[Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs Extension]] was just the initial configuration and the consensus vote to enable it.  The page remained just that for quite a while even after the configuration was changed, until I finally got bold enough to add to the front of the page the ''current'' configuration, with at the start of that a list of links to the bugzilla requests that shaped it and consensus votes for those requests.  I would have made the page ''only'' the current configuration and associated lists of links, except that I meant to preserve the original consensus vote including what it was a vote for.  (If I were doing it now I might have just renamed the existing page to something like {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs Extension/Initial configuration&lt;/tt&gt;}}, and provided that as the link for the first consensus.)

:I'm all for documenting stuff, but it seems to me that {{nowrap|[[Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs Extension]]}} is a techie page, as reflected by its techie title.  I'm inclined to think prose explanations probably don't belong there.  They'd be happier somewhere that's actually devoted to prose explanation, well clear of the configuration code.  Most likely, the only changes at {{nowrap|[[Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs Extension]]}} should be adding to the lead sentence a link to the new {{nowrap|[[Help:Revision review|Wikibooks:Revision review]]}}, adding links to the new consensus vote and associated bugzilla (this is supposing such comes to pass), and updating the current configuration to reflect the newly reached consensus so that it remains a faithful representation of what we have voted for.

:It's not clear, at least not yet clear, to me quite what sort of content is being constructed here, so I'm not sure where it ought to go.  Right now it seems to be description of what's being changed, which seems like it belongs back at the ongoing discussion in the reading room (where there is a description; perhaps the point of a third description is to have it at yet another level of abstraction?).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 22:46, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

::I believe this is looking to be an expanded summary of what is being changed, without the intimidation posed by the large discussion in which things were hashed out.  We frankly may not see anyone else put forth a position in the support/neutral/oppose sections due to that and the technical nature of the proposal.  This may be hoping to remedy that by creating something more approachable. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 23:21, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

== Reconfiguring Wikibooks ==
I have one stipulation, we need to have a separate group who can mark pages as featured. That way the Admins won't have such a load. We can just call it &quot;Featurer&quot;, but it is necessary! [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 11:21, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

{{support}} as defined in rev [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Revision_review/Proposed&amp;oldid=1873216 1873216] of the proposal page. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 12:08, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

:Both positions are contradictory. Since the version you support doesn't provide for that group (to what requirement I agree) but as you state it as a stipulation you make your possition contradictory. You can, as I am, be neutral and not oppose the change or move for the alteration and oppose the proposal. I would second you on promoting the change.
:In any case lets not restart a vote here at this moment since the previous one hasn't reached any special decision and the comments there are still pertinent for the process. State your position there, note that the target has moved yet again some provision have been added to the creation and alteration of filters). I'll make a post on your talk.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:27, 3 July 2010 (UTC)
::Indeed.  We're close to closure on the proposal (I disagree on the not reaching a special decision) due to overwhelming support after a long, tiring process of weighing views, making compromises, and determining what will work best for as many as possible. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:21, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

;Counterproposal
It is clear that the initial vote process was premature and the actual reading of the supporting votes isn't clearcut (as seen above). I have advocated in the past for initiating the process by a call for objections. Well lets put it in practice, the only standing objection to what is now refereed as rev 1868898 is Thenub314. I with the help of Adrignola have created a clear restatement of the proposal, that was has now been updated to include some alterations. 

My simple counterproposal is as fallows:&lt;br&gt;
A reseting of positions and take the present version [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs_Extension/Unstable&amp;oldid=1873356 1873356] as the common ground for building upon for consensus.&lt;br&gt;
A [[Wikibooks talk:FlaggedRevs Extension/Unstable#Considerations regarding proposal 1873356|phase for restating concerns and proposals for alteration to the active version]]. That can start now as there will be no conflict to the process, or current positions.&lt;br&gt;
If changes are agreed then another phase to alter the proposal and for anyone to raise objections to the changes made to it and restart the process.&lt;br&gt;
(7 days of inactivity of the thread to consider a phase ended )&lt;br&gt;
Any objections to this?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:55, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

== Considerations regarding proposal [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs_Extension/Unstable&amp;oldid=1873356 1873356] ==
Adrignola, for my benefit and others, what were the changes done from the mentioned [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs_Extension/Unstable&amp;oldid=1873081 1873081] (my last edit), that equated to [{{fullurl:Wikibooks:Reading room/General#Reconfigure Wikibooks|oldid=1868918}} rev 1868918] (the version objected by Thenub314) to the present [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs_Extension/Unstable&amp;oldid=1873356 1873356] ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:16, 3 July 2010 (UTC)
:Everyone's been noting the reading room revision in listing support, but Arlen started pointing to this page's revisions instead.  This isn't the official proposal page.  The note at the top of this content page notes what version of the reading room it reflects.  The only change involves the edit filter extension.    To alleviate your concerns about the edit filter being a power grab, I've added a configuration option that removes the ability for admins to define filters that would block users (such that they would have to request unblock and hope their request doesn't go unnoticed) or remove users from groups (such as bureaucrat).  That limits the effect of edit filters to innocuous actions such as tagging an edit in recent changes or warning the user visually, preventing abuse of the anti-abuse system.  You've had concerns about administrators not having to get consensus to make changes.  I've felt it would add extra bureaucracy given that these filters shouldn't interfere or be noticed by good-faith contributors and are not some means for admins to determine what is &quot;allowed&quot; at Wikibooks. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:37, 3 July 2010 (UTC)
::Sincerely I doubt that anyone not involved with the discussion from the begging could make head or tails from it (or have the time and patience to work at it). I could even argue that the process was extremely badly run, but that wouldn't advance the resolution of the issues. If you like we can discuss the subject later as this is not the first time that I felt frustrated as how the decision process gets implemented is this convoluted way, and why I pressed for a clarified version to be available not only to me but to the community. I don't oppose having low impact decisions run on the general discussion forum but more care should be made to create an ordered environment where people come to mutual understanding (This is somewhat done for policies and gidelines at [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines/Vote]]). I have myself had difficulties understanding the discussion (it wasn't even advanced as a proposal at first), most support votes are diffuse and one is contradictory, even Mike's neutral stance expresses a misunderstanding as he refers Editors, ultimately the right place to run a proposal is were we agree to, it is all circumstantial. But lets leave that for the later.
::I acknowledge that your last changes address my preoccupation, not as a power grab as you state, but as avoidance of future conflicts or disturbances in the present. In that regard I'm satisfied by the changes made, and now I can't foresee a situation where unrecoverable harm or escalation of tensions could occur by the particular use of the new extension.
::I've also thought about why WK decided to create the Editors group, the position I and other that now have came forward expressed on the abolishment of it passing the right only to the admins group. This is the only reason that I don't support the proposal, but see it as an improvement over the status quo. This is also a game changer for the requesting of permissions, will we from now on require new admins to be reviewers ? Can we now object to have present editors request the admin flag just to categorize their own work as &quot;featured&quot;. (the determination of this term should be also made before final approval)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:02, 3 July 2010 (UTC)
:::I don't know why anyone up for consideration to be an admin wouldn't already have been autopromoted to reviewer.  Even if they somehow weren't, the admin group has the rights of the reviewer group assigned to it as well. A request to be an admin for the purposes of reviewing pages wouldn't be taken seriously considering all of the other responsibilities associated with the group (such as deletions and blocks). &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:34, 3 July 2010 (UTC)
::::Since the cataloging of pages as featured would be restricted to the admins group that qualifies as an administrative task (it all depends on what we define here that classification to be, it still isn't), but your reply seems contradictory, I read it as you expect requests for adminship to be only from the reviewer group (in itself a distinction, at present I don't see that as a requirement myself), I don't see any rational way one could refuse a request from anyone on the previous editors groups (they will by now have demonstrated confidence in using the system and with the change will have even rollback capabilities) what would you state as a reason not to take seriously people that have demonstrated to the community to have an invested interest in the wellbeing of the project?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:59, 3 July 2010 (UTC)
:::::I read that facet of it as saying that if the community is willing to trust someone with the admin tools, then the community is surely willing to trust them with the reviewer bit.  (Or, to state the same thing from the pessimistic side, if the community isn't willing to trust someone with the reviewer bit, then the community is surely not willing to trust them with the admin tools.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 23:56, 3 July 2010 (UTC)
::::::Not precisely the reviewer since it is an auto-promoted tool (but similar since it will now have rollback), I was indicating the standing [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:ListUsers&amp;group=editor editor group] (a bit more experienced and goal oriented than the normal reviewer). But the issue is that turning the quality review of works into an administrative task will therefore require administrators to perform them. This bring into consideration what constitutes the task and how will it be implemented (that is left undefined on the proposal), as I stated I would move to support the proposal if the use of the categorization would fallow an open process of decision (this would also remove the need to define it now).
::::::The other consideration is that since the abolishing of page patrol and now rollback we removed the normal pool of Wikibookians that we normally selected as demonstrating a will to perform the administrative tasks.
::::::As we continue to move the requirements up (for instance the process to make Adrignola an admin clearly showed the changes that have occurred there), it is important to understand the impact automated access to tools brings and understand that those automated tools do provide some level of validation to users actions on the project, this also has an impact on how we set the bar to those accesses, we have to keep in mind that any user in 30 day + 100 edits will now be able to get unsupervised rollback. I know that people have been moving that bar lower but we should keep the eye on the ball, probably the top reason for the filters.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:08, 4 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Tentative numbering system for US stamps==
Based on ''[[World Stamp Catalogue/Numbering System]]'' the following numbering system is being tried for US stamps

 Format:  CCC - YYYY - SSDD - TTKK
          ---   ----   ----   ----
 Example: USA - 1851 - 0101 - 3201
          ---   ----   ----   ----
 where: CCC  = 3-letter country code
                 (USA = United States)
        YYYY = 4-digit year of issue
                 (1851 = Year of issue)
        SS   = 2-digit series order (varies by year)
                 (01 = first (and only) series for 1851)
        DD   = 2-digit denomination order (varies by series)
                 (01 = 1-cent, 02 = 3-cent, 03 = 5-cent, etc.)
        TT   = 2-digit type and subtype (varies by denomination),   
                 (31 = Type III, 32 = Type IIIa)
        KK   = 2-digit color variation (varies by denomination),
                 (01 = first (and only) color for this denomination (blue))

This numbering system will likely change to some extent as more stamps are catalogued.  This system will probably not apply to local, carrier and provisional stamps issued in the US.Ha!

'''Almond Milk''' is plant [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] that is one of the [[Cookbook:Vegan Substitutions#Dairy|vegan substitutes for dairy]]. Plant milks are suitable for people who have a lactose intolerance or simply want to try something different.

Unlike cow’s milk, this recipe contains no cholesterol, is much lower in saturated fat, and lacks casein, making it suitable for more people, since some choose a Gluten-free, casein-free diet or are allergic to casein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Unlike [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|Soy Milk]], this recipe is suitable for those who wish to avoid soy due to its estrogenic properties or hexane content or people who are have soy allergies.

== Equipment ==
*Measuring cup
*Bowl
*Refrigerator
*[[Cookbook:Blender|Blender]]
*[[Cookbook:Sieve|Sieve]] &amp; [[Cookbook:Wooden Spoon|wooden spoon]] or sprout/nut-milk bag
*Pitcher
*Drinking cup

== Ingredients ==
*1 bowl of water
*1 cup  (236 ml) [[Cookbook:Almond|almond]]s
*{{Cups|3}} pure [[Cookbook:Water|water]], such as [[Cookbook:Rosewater|rosewater]], orange blossom water, spring water, distilled water, or iodized water
*3 [[Cookbook:Date|date]]s

== Procedure ==

#Put the almonds into a bowl of water. Make sure they are covered completely underneath at least one (1) inch (2&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;²⁷⁄&lt;big&gt;₅₀&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cm) of water. This is called sprouting or steeping. Leave them in the refrigerator overnight, and then drain the water.
#Put the almonds from the previous step into a blender and add {{Cups|3}} of pure water. The mixture will start clear and quickly change color. Stop blending after a few minutes when there is no visible change in color or consistency anymore. Wash and dry your hands, and strain this mixture over a pitcher. You can either strain it through a fine sieve by squeezing the milk from the moist mixture through the sieve with a wooden spoon, or simply place mesh sometimes called a sprout or nut-milk bag that is usually made of nylon on top of the pitcher in order to squeeze the mixture through the mesh by hand. You may either discard the pulp or use it for other recipes, such as mixing it into almond [[Cookbook:Agar Jelly|agar jelly]]. Wash and dry your hands, and then pour the almond milk back into the blender. Add the dates and blend until there is no visible change in color or consistency anymore.
#Pour into a drinking cup and enjoy!

== Variations ==
Unlike dates, artificial sweeteners usually do not have any nutrients. If you would like to substitute the dates for something else, try natural sweeteners, such or stevia or [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] instead of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] or syrup, if you can. Just bear in mind using honey would make this recipe not be vegan, if that is important to you.

== Warnings ==
*Do not use bitter almonds, since the combination of bitter almonds and water releases cyanide.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Do not keep the mixture from step 2 above for more than 2 days, since it spoils quickly. It's best to make it fresh.
*There are recipes that use a stove or boiling water, but heat destroys the food enzymes in the almonds.
*Using water that is not pure, such as tap water, may have an adverse taste.

I'm currently a Computer Science student in Poland, work as a programmer and IT administrator as such have a rather busy life. I'm interested in most things technical and science-y.

I'm working at the [[LaTeX]] book currently, later on, I'm planning to translate it to Polish (drop me a line if you are interested in cooperation or particular chapter).

Perhaps it would be better to suggest another liquid like syrup or glycerine instead of alcohol, as under-12's are not likely to be given quantities of pure alcohol to experiment with in class. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 00:13, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

==Light particles?==
I thought light could behave like a wave or particle - e.g. in solar cells or heat emission from a hot body. What you are really asking is not &quot;what is true?&quot;, but &quot;what have we said so far about the particle theory?&quot;. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 00:13, 3 July 2010 (UTC)
:*Our teacher says that light is not matter.
:*I've read that photons have no weight.
:*I don't understand what you mean about 'what is true'.
:Thanks [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 10:43, 3 July 2010 (UTC)
::Well, according to the Wikipedia article on [[W:Photon|photons]], light can be understood both as a wave and as a particle and the question of whether the light photon has any mass is an experimental question which is not finally settled. I suppose I am trying to inject some caution into any hard and fast statements about what we really know for sure about matter and light. Our knowledge may be quite good but it is not perfect, and it probably never will be. This means that anyone reading the book is not really in a position to answer the question &quot;Is it true that light is not made of particles?&quot;. The issue is more complicated than the material in the book suggests, so it is unreasonable to expect readers to produce an answer. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 18:47, 3 July 2010 (UTC)
:::Then we shouldn't let the readers take in unverified info... OK, then, let's let it be that way, and ASSUME that light is not made of particles.

{{outdent|:::}}
Note that [[User:Whoop whoop pull up]] has just replaced &quot;Light is not made of particles&quot; with &quot;Sound is not made of particles&quot;, with the slightly glib, but of course cogent (as this thread atests), edit summary &quot;I take it you have never heard of PHOTONS?&quot;.  An even more glib (perhaps even smart-alecky) response to that question might be &quot;I take it you have never heard of [[w:phonon|PHONONS]]?&quot;

The important question seems to be whether a quantum can be said to be &quot;not a particle&quot;.  (And if the answer is &quot;no&quot;, then is there ''anything'' that can ever be said to be not a particle?)

Many years ago I took a class on quantum mechanics, and one day in class one of the students (there were only about a dozen of us, I think) asked a question about photons.  The professor promised he'd ask around the department faculty lounge.  Next week he reported back to us that, to his surprise, he'd gotten as many different answers as he'd gotten answers, and one was a claim that there are no such things as photons.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 02:04, 18 April 2011 (UTC)

:Okay, fine.  Light and sound may or may be not be made of particles, but heat definitely is not.

Seismograms tell seismologists how strong an earthquake is and how far away it is. At least three seismograms must be used to calculate where the epicenter is located. Over the past century, scientists have developed several ways of measuring earthquake intensity. The currently accepted method is the moment magnitude scale, which measures the total amount of energy released by the earthquake. At this time, seismologists have not found a reliable method for predicting earthquakes.

==Lesson Objectives==
* List the different types of seismic waves, their different properties and describe how seismologists can use them to learn about earthquakes and the Earth's interior.
* Describe how to find an earthquake epicenter.
* Describe the different earthquake magnitude scales and what the numbers for moment magnitude mean.
* Describe how earthquakes are predicted and why the field of earthquake prediction has had little success.

==Measuring Magnitude==
A '''seismometer''' is a machine that records seismic waves. In the past, all seismometers were '''seismographs''' because they produced a graph-like representation of the seismic waves they received. The paper record is called a '''seismogram'''. Modern seismometers record ground motions using electronic motion detectors. The data are then kept digitally on a computer.

Seismographs have a pen suspended from a stationary frame, while a drum of paper rotates beneath it. The pen is weighted so that it is suspended and not attached to the ground. The drum is attached to the ground. As the earth shakes in an earthquake, the pen remains stationary but the drum moves beneath it. This creates the squiggly lines that make up a seismogram (Figure 7.39).

[[File:Kinemetrics seismograph.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 7.39''': A seismograph that had recorded an earthquake is beginning to record another earthquake, likely an aftershock.]]

Seismograms contain information on how strong an earthquake was, how long it lasted, and how far away it was. The wiggly lines that are produced in a seismogram clearly show the different arrival times of P- and S-waves (Figure 7.40). As with words on a page, the seismogram record goes from left to right. First, there is a flat line, where there was no ground shaking. The first waves to be recorded by the seismogram are P-waves since they are the fastest. S-waves come in next and are usually larger than P-waves. The surface waves arrive just after the S-waves. If the earthquake has a shallow focus, the surface waves will be the largest ones recorded.

[[File:Seismogram.gif|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 7.40''': These seismograms show the arrival of P-waves and S-waves. The surface waves arrive just after the S-waves and are difficult to distinguish. Time is indicated on the horizontal portion (or x-axis) of the graph.]]

If a seismogram has recorded P-waves and surface waves, but not S-waves, the seismograph was on the other side of the planet from the earthquake. Scientists know that the earth's outer core is liquid because S-waves cannot travel through liquid. The liquid outer core creates an S-wave shadow zone on the opposite side of the planet from the earthquake's focus where no S-waves reach. The amplitude (height) of the waves can be used to determine the magnitude of the earthquake. How magnitude is calculated will be discussed in a later section.

==Finding the Epicenter==
A single seismogram can tell a seismologist how far away the earthquake was but it does not provide the seismologist with enough information to locate the exact epicenter. For that, the seismologist needs at least three seismograms. Determining distance to an earthquake epicenter depends on the fact that different seismic waves travel at different speeds. P-waves always arrive at a seismometer first, but the amount of time it takes for the S-waves to arrive after the P-wave indicates distance to the epicenter. If the epicenter is near the seismometer, the P-waves, S-waves and surface waves will all arrive in rapid succession. If the epicenter is further away, the S-waves will lag further behind. In other words, the longer it is between the arrival of the P-wave and S-wave from an earthquake, the farther the epicenter is from the seismometer.

After many years of study, geologists know the speed at which the different types of waves travel through various earth materials. Based on the difference in the arrival times of the first P wave and the first S wave, seismologists determine the distance between the epicenter and a seismometer. Once the distance to the epicenter is known, scientists can identify each point that is that distance away. Let's say that they know that an earthquake's epicenter is 50 kilometers from Kansas City. When each point that is that distance away from Kansas City is marked, the marks create a circle. This circle can be drawn with a compass.

To locate the earthquake epicenter, seismologists must have data from at least three seismometers. A circle drawn at the correct distance to the epicenter from a second seismometer will intercept the first circle in two places. A third circle showing the distance to the epicenter from a third seismometer will intercept the other two circles at a single point. This point is the earthquake epicenter (Figure 7.41). While this method was extremely useful for locating epicenters for decades, the technique has been replaced by digital calculations.

[[File:Determining epicenter.png|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 7.41''': Circles are drawn with radii representing the distance from each seismic station to the earthquake's epicenter. The intersection of these three circles is the earthquake's epicenter.]]

==Earthquake Intensity==
People have always tried to quantify the size of and damage done by earthquakes. Early in the 20th century, earthquakes could only be described in terms of what nearby residents felt and the damage that was done to nearby structures. This was called the '''Mercalli Intensity Scale''' and was developed in 1902 by the Italian seismologist Giuseppe Mercalli. The Mercalli Scale is sometimes used today in conjunction with the more modern intensity scales described below.

Table 7.1 shows an abbreviated description of the twelve Mercalli intensity levels:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Table 7.1: Mercalli Intensity Scale
|-
!Number || Description
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|I || Not felt except by a very few under especially favorable conditions.
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|II || Felt only by a few persons at rest, especially on upper floors of buildings.
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|III || Felt noticeably by people indoors, especially on upper floors of buildings. Many people don't know it's an earthquake. Standing automobiles may rock lightly. Vibrations similar to the passing of a truck. Duration estimated.
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|IV || Felt indoors by many, outdoors by few during the day. At night, some awakened. Dishes, windows, doors disturbed; walls make cracking sound. Sensation like heavy truck striking building. Standing cars rocked noticeably.
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|V || Felt by nearly everyone; many awakened. Some dishes, windows broken. Unstable objects overturned. Pendulum clocks may stop.
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|VI || Felt by all, many frightened. Some heavy furniture moved; a little fallen plaster. Damage slight.
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|VII || Damage negligible in buildings of good design and construction; slight to moderate in well-built ordinary structures; considerable damage in poorly built or designed structures; some chimneys broken.
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|VIII || Damage slight in specially designed structures; considerable damage in ordinary substantial buildings with partial collapse. Damage great in poorly built structures. Fallen chimneys, factory stacks, columns, monuments, walls. Heavy furniture overturned.
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|IX || Damage considerable in specially designed structures; well-designed frame structures thrown out of plumb. Damage great in
substantial buildings, with partial collapse. Buildings shifted off foundations.
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|X || Some well-built wooden structures destroyed; most masonry and frame structures destroyed with foundations. Rails bent.
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|XI || Few if any structures still standing. Bridges destroyed. Rails bent greatly.
|-
|style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|XII || Damage total. Lines of sight and level distorted. Objects thrown into air.
|}

There were many problems with the Mercalli scale. What people feel and see in an earthquake is affected by how far they are from the earthquake's focus, the type of rock that lies beneath them, the construction type of the nearby buildings, and many other factors. Different observers will also perceive the experience differently. For example, one might exaggerate while the other downplays the damage done. With the Mercalli scale, comparisons between earthquakes are difficult to make.

To address these problems, in 1935 Charles Richter developed his '''Richter magnitude scale'''. The Richter scale measures the magnitude of the largest jolt of energy released in an earthquake. Because Richter's scale is logarithmic, the amplitude of the largest wave increases 10 times from one integer to the next. For example, the amplitude of the largest seismic wave of a magnitude 5 quake is 10 times that of a magnitude 4 quake and 100 times that of a magnitude 3 quake. One integer increase in magnitude roughly correlates with a 30-fold increase in the amount of energy released. A difference of two integers on the Richter scale equals a 1,000-fold increase in released energy.

Seismologists recognize that the Richter scale has limitations, since it measures the height of the greatest earthquake wave. A single sharp jolt will measure higher on the Richter scale than a very long intense earthquake that releases more energy. In other words, earthquakes that release more energy are likely to do more damage than those that are short, but have a larger single jolt. Using the Richter scale, a high magnitude may not necessarily reflect the amount of damage caused.

The '''moment magnitude scale''' is the current method of measuring earthquake magnitudes. This method measures the total energy released by an earthquake and so more accurately reflects its magnitude. Moment magnitude is calculated from the area of the fault that is ruptured and the distance the earth moved along the fault. Like the Richter scale, the moment magnitude scale is logarithmic. An increase in one integer means that 30 times more energy was released, while two integers means that 1,000 times the energy was released released. The Richter and moment magnitude scales often give very similar measurements.

In a single year, more than 900,000 earthquakes are recorded. 150,000 of them are strong enough to be felt. About 18 per year are major, with a Richter magnitude of 7.0 to 7.9. Each year, on average, one earthquake with a magnitude of 8 to 8.9 strikes. Remember that many of these earthquakes occur deep in the crust and out in the oceans and do not cause much or any damage on land.

Earthquakes with a magnitude in the 9 range are rare. The United States Geological Survey lists six such earthquakes on the moment magnitude scale in historic times (see Figure 7.42 and Table 7.2). All but one of them, the Great Indian Ocean Earthquake of 2004, occurred somewhere around the Pacific Ring of Fire.

[[File:AlaskaQuake-FourthAve.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 7.42''': The 1964 Good Friday Earthquake centered in Prince William Sound, Alaska released the second most amount of energy of any earthquake in recorded history.]]

==Earthquake Prediction==
To be valuable, an earthquake prediction must be accurate. A good predication would anticipate the date, location, and magnitude of the earthquake. The prediction would need to be accurate so that authorities could convince people to evacuate. An unnecessary evacuation would be very expensive and would decrease the credibility of authorities who might need to evacuate the region at a later time. Unfortunately, accurate predictions like these are not likely to be common for a long time.

The easiest thing to predict is where an earthquake will occur (Figure 7.43). Because nearly all earthquakes take place at plate boundaries, and because earthquakes tend to happen where they’ve occurred before, scientists know which locations are likely to have earthquakes. This information is useful to communities because those that are earthquake-prone can prepare for the event. For example, these communities can implement building codes to make structures earthquake safe. The added work and expense can be avoided in areas that are not at risk.

[[File:Eq-prob.jpg|500px|thumb|center|'''Figure 7.43''': The probabilities of earthquakes striking along various faults in the San Francisco area between 2003 (when the work was done) and 2032.]]

Predicting when an earthquake will occur is much more difficult. Scientists can get a general idea by looking at the historical and geological records of earthquakes in an area. If stress on a fault builds up at the same rate over time, then earthquakes should occur at regular intervals. While this is true, there is a large margin of error in these predictions. Using this method, scientists cannot even be accurate to within a few years, and evacuation is not practical.

Seismologists have also used the seismic gap theory for long-term earthquake prediction. In this theory, scientists assume that, on average, all of the rocks on the same side of a fault move at the same rate. For example, they say that rocks on the North American plate side of the San Andreas Fault in California move at the same speed over time. While this may be true, the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes along the fault is not the same: there are more quakes in the northern and southern sections, but a relatively inactive zone in the center.

Seismologists attempted to use the seismic gap theory to predict an earthquake in a seismic gap. Around Parkfield, California earthquakes occur regularly: an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 or higher occurs about every 22 years. Using this information, seismologists predicted that a magnitude 6 or greater earthquake would strike the region in 1993. In the mid-1980s, seismologists with the United States Geological Survey set up an enormous number of instruments along the Parkfield section of the San Andreas to monitor the expected earthquake. While they were right that an earthquake was due in that segment of the fault, they were quite far off in predicting the earthquake’s timing. A magnitude 6.0 quake did not strike Parkfield until 2004, 11 years late.

Scientists have recognized some indicators that allow them to recognize that a large earthquake is likely. Large earthquakes are often preceded by small tremors, called foreshocks, that occur between a few seconds and a few weeks before a major quake. However, many earthquakes are not preceded by foreshocks and clusters of small earthquakes are not necessarily followed by a large earthquake.

Large earthquakes are also often preceded by the tilting of the ground surface, which is caused by the buildup of stress in the rocks. Seismologists measure the ground tilt and use the changes to predict an impending earthquake. While this technique has been somewhat successful, it has also been a part of predictions of earthquakes that never came and has failed to predict some that did. Water levels in wells fluctuate as water moves into or out of fractures before an earthquake. This information can also be used as a possible, but uncertain, predictor of large earthquakes.

The most successful earthquake prediction was on February 4, 1975. At the recommendation of Chinese seismologists, officials evacuated many of the residents of the Manchurian province of Liaoning. Although the region was not prone to earthquakes, the seismologists made their prediction because the area experienced about 400 small foreshocks over a few days. The night of the evacuation an earthquake of magnitude 7.3 struck the town and only a few hundred people died. An estimated 150,000 people may have been saved. However, a little more than a year later, Chinese seismologists failed to predict the Tangshan earthquake, which killed more than 250,000 people. One month after that, Chinese officials evacuated residents of the Guandong Province for an earthquake that never came.

There is value in predicting the arrival of seismic waves from an earthquake that is already taking place. Seismometers can detect P-waves a few seconds before more damaging S-waves and surface waves arrive. Although a few seconds is not much, a coordinated computerized system can use that time to shut down gas mains and high tension electrical transmission lines, and initiate protective measures in chemical plants, nuclear power plants, mass transit systems, airports and on roadways.

Folklore tells of animals behaving erratically just before an earthquake. Mostly these anecdotes are told after the earthquake, when people remember back to the time before the shaking began. Memories are notoriously faulty. However, Chinese scientists actively study the behavior of animals before earthquakes to see if there is something to the anecdotes.

One interesting tale involves the number of animals killed in the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, which appeared to be surprisingly low. Reports abound suggesting that the animals had a &quot;sixth sense&quot; that warned them of the danger. In Sri Lanka's Yala National Park, for example, about 60 tourists and park employees drowned but few large animals. Three elephants were seen fleeing to higher ground. On closer inspection, the elephants with tracking collars appeared to have exhibited normal movements for the day. If indeed animals sense danger from earthquakes or tsunamis, scientists do not know what it is they could be sensing, but they would like to find out.

==Lesson Summary==
* Seismologists use seismograms to determine how strong an earthquake is, how far away it is, and how long it lasts.
* Epicenters can be calculated using the difference in the arrival times of P-and S-waves from three seismograms.
* The intensity of an earthquake can be determined in many ways. The Mercalli Scale identifies the damage done and what people feel, the Richter Scale measures the greatest amplitude of the earthquake, and the moment magnitude scale measures the total energy released by an earthquake.
* Despite some successes, seismologists have not come too far in their ability to predict earthquakes.

==Review Questions==
# How can a seismograph measure ground shaking if all parts of it must be attached to the ground?
# On a seismogram, which waves arrive first, second, third and which arrive last?
# What information is needed for seismologists to calculate the distance that a seismic station is from an earthquake's epicenter?
# If a seismogram records P-waves and surface waves but not S-waves, where was the earthquake epicenter located relative to the seismograph and why?
# Like the Richter scale, the magnitude moment scale is logarithmic. What is the difference in the amount of energy released by an earthquake that is a 7.2 versus an 8.2 in magnitude? A 7.2 versus a 9.2?
# Why do you need at least three seismographs to locate an earthquake epicenter?
# While the Mercalli scale is still used for measuring earthquake magnitude, why is it not the only scale used? Where does it fall short relative to the Richter and Moment Magnitude scales?
# Why is the moment magnitude scale thought to be more useful than the Richter scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes?
# What is the difference in energy released between a 6 and a 7 on the Richter scale? How about a 6 and a 7 on the moment magnitude scale?
# How do seismologists use earthquake foreshocks to predict earthquakes? Why are foreshocks not always an effective prediction tool?
# What are the characteristics of a good earthquake prediction? Why are these features needed?
# Why were Chinese seismologists so successful at predicting the 1975 earthquake in the Manchurian province of Liaoning? Why did they fail to predict the 1976 Tangshan earthquake and evacuate Guandong Province a month later needlessly?

Hi, and let me chime in here with a couple of thoughts.  First and foremost communication over on a wiki is somehow less then perfect. It is easy to read several different meanings into written statement. So it is very easy to misinterpret something someone has written and find it offensive of combative.  Because of this most wiki's have a policy along the lines of assume good faith.  Basically we are all hear trying to help out in one way or another, and we often disagree.  Assuming good faith basically means to assume that everyone here is trying to help, no one is intentionally being combative or disruptive.  

A more constructive way to take your frustration about edit conflicts would have been to leave a message on Adrignloa's talk page to the effect.

&quot;Could you please knock off adding nonsensical BookCat templates to the pages of my book, it is  causing edit conflicts and making it very difficult to do my work&quot;

I am guessing he would have basically to the effect of &quot;Either you handle or I will.&quot;  But no matter what he said, it gets across your point much better than blanking his talk page.  As a matter of culture on wiki's blanking a page is considered very rude and disruptive.  I don't blame you for not knowing this, your knew around here, and as you say it can always be reverted.  But, for better or worse blanking a page  is the equivalent of &quot;spitting on a mans shoes&quot;, it is just something seen as extremely rude.  And he probably didn't notice changes at your page, because he didn't in the beginning have a reason to be looking at it.  None of us did really.

This is because for technical reasons it is very useful to correctly categorize the pages.  But you can't blame him for edit conflicts.  They happen all the time and no one intends them.  If you change your mind about your book, or want to contribute in some other way, please do.  Just be a little more patient with other people.  If you can't, then understand editing at a wiki will not work out for you long term. If you change your mind about a book, anything that was deleted can be undeleted by posting a message at [[WB:RFU|this page]].

Remember, things you write are often not read the way you might mean them to be.  This, for example, is be best reason not to use expletives in conversations, the are just too emotionally charged and will certainly be taken the wrong way.

:That's interesting because he irreversibly (for me) '''deleted''' my talk page [[User:Quasicrystal|Quasicrystal]] ([[User talk:Quasicrystal|talk]]) 11:36, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

::Don't provide a false view of the situation to make me look bad.  At that point I was aware of your frustrations and you '''blanked''' your talk page, which, in user space for one's own pages or on normal pages where one is the only contributor, is equivalent to requesting deletion; that seemed reasonable to me because it appeared that you desired to [[w:WP:VANISH|leave]].  Either contribute constructively or stop this vendetta against me.  Thenub has provided some very nice advice and you should take it. Start by assuming that your talk page was deleted at your implicit request, just as your book pages were deleted at your explicit request. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:19, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Reunion=

*&lt;font size=3&gt;This island in the Indian Ocean is an overseas department or region of France with full political integration into the mother country.

* The first meter stamps appeared in 1952 and were identical to French stamps of the time except for the inclusion of “C F A” (Colonie Francaise Afrique) in the frank. In the 1970s stamps without “C F A” began to be used. These stamps are identical to those of continental France and differ only in the contents of the town mark. 

* Listed below are stamps with “C F A” in the frank. For stamps without &quot;C F A&quot; see See [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/International_Postage_Meter_Stamp_Catalog/France#Annex:_Stamps_used_in_French_overseas_departments FRANCE/Annex].

      <comment>/* Wikibooks Goals */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm a student! I'm currently in my senior year of earing a bachelor's of English, with minors in computer science and German. My goal is to ultimately go into web publishing and technical writing for a few years; I'd like to finish a bachelor's of science in computer science at that point. I currently work with adaptive technologies for users with disabilities, and I think a fantastic project would be to develop an operating system with the needs of these users in mind.

A couple of other career options I'm lookng at are joining the US military (I live in the US), becoming a law enforcement officer, becoming a firefighter, and starting up a company that produces books in braille.

==Wikibooks Goals==
At the moment, I'm gathering material to continue the ''Anthology to American Literature'' book. I also plan to contribute to the German and Esperanto books/projects. As soon as I have time, I also plan to create a book on the card game Progressive Rummy.</text>

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template can be used to quickly create a [[Wikibooks:Userboxes|userbox]] for display on a user's user page without having to know HTML or Wikitable syntax.

== Usage ==
&lt;!-- Abstract usage of the template, one variable per row. --&gt;
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow: auto&quot;&gt;
{{userbox
| bodyclass = &lt;!-- Adds an HTML class attribute to the entire template's HTML table, to allow for styling, emission of microformats, etc. --&gt;
| float    = &lt;!--left|right|none (default = left)--&gt;
| border-c = &lt;!--border color (default = id-c)--&gt;
| border-s = &lt;!--border width in pixels (default = 1)--&gt;
| id       = &lt;!--id text or image--&gt;
| id-c     = &lt;!--id background color--&gt;
| id-fc    = &lt;!--id font color--&gt;
| id-s     = &lt;!--id text size--&gt;
| id-p     = &lt;!--id cell padding space--&gt;
| id-lh    = &lt;!--id line height--&gt;
| id-op    = &lt;!--id other parameter (CSS)--&gt;
| id-w     = &lt;!--id box width--&gt;
| id-h     = &lt;!--id box height--&gt;
| info-class = &lt;!-- Adds an HTML class attribute to the &quot;info&quot; HTML table-row, to allow for styling, microformats, etc. --&gt;
| info     = &lt;!--info text--&gt;
| info-c   = &lt;!--info background color--&gt;
| info-fc  = &lt;!--info font color--&gt;
| info-s   = &lt;!--info text size--&gt;
| info-p   = &lt;!--info padding (distance between cell contents &amp; cell border)--&gt;
| info-lh  = &lt;!--info line height (or distance in between text lines)--&gt;
| info-op  = &lt;!--info other (CSS) parameter(s)--&gt;
| nocat    = {{{nocat|}}}&lt;!--when 'true', doesn't categorize the user--&gt;
| usercategory  = &lt;!--user category (optional)--&gt;
| usercategory2 = &lt;!--user category (optional)--&gt;
| usercategory3 = &lt;!--user category (optional)--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Text size is assumed to be in [[w:Point (typography)|points]]
* All parameters are optional

Most HTML-based tables use only a handful of these attributes. The following subset can be used to quickly convert an HTML userbox into the format used here:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{userbox
| border-c     = 
| info-c       = 
| id-c         = 
| id-fc        = 
| id-s         = 
| id           = 
| info-fc      = 
| info-lh      = 
| info-s       = 
| info-a       =
| info         = 
| notes        =
| notes-c      =
| notes-lh     =
| notes-fc     =
| nocat        = {{{nocat|}}}
| usercategory = 
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Examples ==
{|
!style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot;| Code
!Result

|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot;| Below example shows how we can change that userbox and further specify parameters to bring down the overall height of the userbox to the recommended height of 45px, even with four text lines. Cell padding parameter &quot;''info-p''&quot; can also be set at &quot;''1pt 1pt 1pt 2pt''&quot;, or &quot;''1pt 2pt''&quot; for better appearance, when there are 4 text lines.
|-
| &lt;pre&gt;{{userbox

|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot;| Below example is for advanced users, showing how we can specify other [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] properties, for example, &quot;''font-family''&quot;, to change the font or &quot;''text-align''&quot; to change the alignment from the default parameters. At below, on the right side are two userboxes: top one is displayed without the &quot;''font-family''&quot; or &quot;''text-align''&quot; parameters; and the bottom userbox is displayed by using the below codes, with the help of the &quot;''info-op''&quot; field. 
|-
| &lt;pre&gt;{{userbox
| id = foo logo
| id-s = 14
| id-c = #ffe
| id-lh = 1.1em
| info = foo bar
| info-c = #fef
| info-s = 14
| info-op = font-family:'Courier New'; text-align:center;
| border-c = #afa
| border-s = 2
}}&lt;/pre&gt; || colspan=&quot;2&quot;| {{Userbox|id=foo logo|id-s=14|id-lh=1.1em|id-c=#ffe|info=foo bar|info-c=#fef|info-s=14|border-c=#afa|border-s=2}} &lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br /&gt; {{Userbox|id=foo logo|id-s=14|id-lh=1.1em|id-c=#ffe|info=foo bar|info-c=#fef|info-s=14|info-op=font-family:'Courier New'; text-align:center;|border-c=#afa|border-s=2}}
|}&lt;!-- customize if needed to illustrate parameter use --&gt;

==Microformats==
;bodyclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the userbox as a whole.
;info-class : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the info component.

This template supports the addition of [[w:microformat|microformat]] information. This is done by adding &quot;class&quot; attributes to various data cells, indicating what kind of information is contained within. To flag a userbox as containing [[w:hCard|hCard]] information about a person, for example, add the following parameter:

&lt;pre&gt;
|bodyclass = vcard
&lt;/pre&gt;

''or''

&lt;pre&gt;
|info-class = vcard
&lt;/pre&gt;

''then'' (for example):

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
|title = …the books of &lt;span class=&quot;fn&quot;&gt;Iain Banks&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

...and so forth.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:26, 4 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

-The 'pro' render looks very noob-ish. (multi coloured background, over-specular objects, unnecessary use of subsurf)&lt;br /&gt;
-The proportions &amp; colours of the Blender logo are all off and using a 3D logo very rarely works.&lt;br /&gt;
-Text is casting a harsh, unnecessary shadow on the logo.&lt;br /&gt;

My understanding was that a breeze was simply moving air, which is matter. —'''[[User:Internoob|Internoob]]''' ([[User talk:Internoob|Disc]]·[[Special:Contributions/Internoob|Cont]]·[[wikt:User:Internoob|Wikt]]) 18:21, 25 August 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Plasma==
I think plasma is sometimes called &quot;the 4th state of matter&quot;, but this is obviously less common on Earth than the three &quot;traditional&quot; states, and I guess is outside your HK form one curriculum. (see [[W:Plasma_(physics)|Plasma]] [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 12:35, 4 July 2010 (UTC)
:To understand the behaviour of a plasma, you have to consider electromagnetic forces and effects, so that would probably put it outside of a study of pure particle theories, so I am not proposing that information on plasmas needs to be added to your book, just that you should not say that there only three states of matter. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 13:47, 4 July 2010 (UTC)
::Just for perspective (I don't mean to take any position on what should be covered here), plasma is covered at {{nowrap|[[Wikijunior:The Elements/Plasma]]}}.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:03, 4 July 2010 (UTC)
:::Won't it confuse kids to say, 'now, there are many states of matter, including solid, liquid and gas'? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 06:58, 5 July 2010 (UTC)
::::As you say, it may be best not to mention things that you are not going to explain later, so long as you bear in mind that there can be other states while you are writing it. There could be a risk of giving a misleading impression, but I do not think this page actually needs to be changed. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 22:17, 5 July 2010 (UTC)

:::::There aren't many states of matter, there are (at this educational level, surely) just four.  (They correspond oddly well to European alchemy's &quot;four elements&quot;, earth water air and fire.)  I'm inclined to caution, though, not because I don't think plasma should be mentioned, but because, in order to gracefully mention it without getting into its dynamics, I don't think one wants to take a page-by-page approach.  One should look at the book as a whole, and decide how best to mention plasma without disrupting the ebb and flow of the whole.  Unfortunately, I have yet to scrape up time to study the whole of the book (which I would be understating to say I find frustrating).  I do have plasma in mind as something to turn my mind to when I finally get a chance to focus on this book properly.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 23:47, 5 July 2010 (UTC)

==Deposition and Sublimation==
The transitions between water vapour and frost could be mentioned here I think, as described on the Wikipedia page [[W:State_of_matter]]. The diagram there is not what you want, but [[:File:States_of_Matter.JPG|this one]] looks like it might be suitable, if you decide to extend the material.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Indonesia|Cuisine of Indonesia]]

'''Klepon''' (pronounced Klê-pon) is a traditional [[Cookbook:Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]] rice cake, from Javanese cuisine. It is a boiled rice cake, stuffed with liquid '''gula jawa''' ([[Cookbook:Gula Jawa|Palm sugar]]), and rolled in grated coconut. Klepon is green because it is flavored with a paste made from the [[Cookbook:Pandan|pandan]].

==Ingredients==
*300 gram [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|glutinous rice flour]] 
*30 grams [[Cookbook:Sagoo|sagoo flour]] 
*8-10 pandan leaves or pandan paste 
*150 gram [[Cookbook:Gula Jawa|gula jawa]] (palm sugar)
*300 gram grated [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]]
*water

==Procedure==
#Grind pandan leaves finely, mix with water or just use pandan paste. Grate the coconut, put aside.   
#Mix Glutinous Rice Flour and Sagoo Flour until well mixed, add pandan paste and a little water. Mix well with hand until it formed a soft green dough. make  Make sure that the dough is not to hard, if necessary add a bit more of water.    
#Form a little balls shape with 2-3 cm diameter, push it with your finger to make a small hole, fill it with palm sugar, close it again and form a ball.  
#Boil a lot of water in a big stock pot. Put the little balls one by one in the boiling water. Cook for about 5 minutes until they emerge on the surface of the boiling water. Take them out and drain. 
#Sprinkle or rolled the balls on shredded coconut.

This template is meant to simplify the merge/split procedures by providing one template that can be used on the talk pages of source and destination pages. Intended for use on talk pages, this template identifies that text has been copied or moved from one page to another, recording attribution dependencies.

=== Usage ===

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{copied|from=|from_oldid=|to=|diff=}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; 

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{copied|from=|from_oldid=|to=|to_diff=|to_oldid=}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

* &lt;code&gt;from&lt;/code&gt; is the source page, where the text originally appeared.
* &lt;code&gt;from_oldid&lt;/code&gt; is the ID of the page revision of the source page from which the text was copied.
*: From the url: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;PAGENAME&lt;/font&gt;&amp;oldid=&lt;font color=red&gt;from_oldid&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; is the destination page, where the text was placed.
* &lt;code&gt;diff&lt;/code&gt; is the [[WB:DIFF|diff]] or permanent [[w:URL|URL]] of the destination page edit when the text was placed.
* &lt;code&gt;to_diff&lt;/code&gt; is the ID of the page revision of the destination page that includes the copied text.
* &lt;code&gt;to_oldid&lt;/code&gt; is the ID of the page revision of the destination page before the text was copied.
*: From the url: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;PAGENAME&lt;/font&gt;&amp;diff=&lt;font color=red&gt;to_diff&lt;/font&gt;&amp;oldid=&lt;font color=red&gt;to_oldid&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; is the date, time and date, or timestamp that the copying took place at.

Example:
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{copied|from=Squirrel|from_oldid=345129608|to=Tree squirrel|diff=http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Tree_squirrel&amp;diff=345159499&amp;oldid=301353806}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Lesson I.2: Wie heißt du? (2. Teil)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
----

The dialogue of this lesson is a conversation between two persons: Franz and Mr. Schwarz. While Franz uses the formal ''Sie'' to address Mr. Schwarz, the latter uses the informal ''du'' to address Franz. We also discuss some grammar: ''subject pronouns'' and some important verbs in the present tense.

==Dialogue==
In this short dialogue Mr. Schwarz uses the informal form ''you'' – ''du''. 
while Franz uses the formal translation of ''you'' – ''Sie''. When listening to the dialogue, try to find out how the word ''Sie'' is pronounced.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Dialogue|What's your name? (2nd Part)|Wie heißt du? (2. Teil)|142|2|Dialogue franz mrschwarz 1.ogg}}

{{German/Exercise|Listen carefully!
|The German pronunciation of many letters is similar to the English pronunciation, but there are also many differences. Try to answer the following question by listening carefully:
# How is the &quot;ie&quot; in &quot;Sie&quot; and &quot;Wiedersehen&quot; pronounced?
# How is the &quot;ei&quot; in &quot;Weiß&quot;, &quot;nein&quot;, &quot;heißt&quot; and &quot;heiße&quot; pronounced?
# How is the &quot;z&quot; in &quot;Schwarz&quot; and &quot;Franz&quot; pronounced?
# How is the &quot;sch&quot; in &quot;Schwarz&quot; pronounced?
# How is the &quot;sp&quot; in &quot;spät&quot; pronounced?
# How is the &quot;ä&quot; in &quot;spät&quot; pronounced?
|
# Similar to &quot;ee&quot; in &quot;meet&quot;.
# &quot;ei&quot; is pronounced like &quot;ai&quot; in German or like the &quot;i&quot; in the English word &quot;time&quot;.
# &quot;z&quot; is pronounced like &quot;ts&quot;.
# &quot;sch&quot; is pronounced like &quot;sh&quot; in English.
# &quot;sp&quot; is usually pronounced like &quot;shp&quot;.
# Similar to &quot;a&quot; in &quot;mad&quot;.

==''Sie'' and ''du''==
Why is Franz using the formal form of ''you'' — ''Sie'' while Mr. Schwarz is using the informal of ''you'' — ''du''?

First of all you should realize that Franz addresses Mr. Schwarz with his last name while Mr. Schwarz addresses Franz with his first name. This is probably the most important rule: if you (would) address someone with his or her last name, you should use the formal ''Sie''. On the other hand, if you are using the first name, you should use ''du''. Anything else would sound funny.

''Sie'' is the polite form. It is used to foreign people, and in order to testify respect against the interlocutor, for people you would address with Mr and Mrs.

So, when do Germans address other people with their first name and say ''du''? 
* Some cases are very clear: children, relatives, and friends are always addressed with ''du''. (Mr. Schwarz uses ''du'' because Franz is still a child. Otherwise Mr. Schwarz would either use ''Sie'' or Franz would also use ''du''.) 
* Students (at universities etc.) usually say ''du'' to other students and everyone else who is of their age or younger. 
* The situation is not so clear for colleagues in companies. Fortunately, there is another rule for grown-ups: any two grown-ups address each other in the same way, either with ''du'' or ''Sie'', but never does only one of them use ''du'' and the other ''Sie''. Thus, if in doubt, you can just copy how the other person addresses you. 
* In all other situations you should use ''Sie''. If a German thinks that it would be more appropriate to say ''du'', he or she will be happy to suggest to use ''du''. On the other hand, it is almost always considered impolite to go from ''du'' to ''Sie''; thus, you shouldn't put someone in a position where he or she wants to suggest to use ''Sie'' instead of ''du''.
* Note that mostly the polite form is easier to use. You just have to learn a few forms of auxiliary and modal verbs. The main verb is usually the infinitive. With the familiar address you unfortunately have to consider many more irregular verbs.

==Subject Pronouns==

A ''noun'' is a word that describes a thing or being, e.g. &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;woman&quot;, &quot;man&quot;, etc. ''Pronouns'' are the little words that refer to previously mentioned nouns, e.g. &quot;it&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, or even &quot;we&quot;, &quot;him&quot;, etc. 
 
The ''subject'' of a sentence is the noun or pronoun that the sentence is about. Usually it is the most active thing or being of the sentence. For example, in the sentence &quot;The woman ate an apple.&quot;, both &quot;woman&quot; and &quot;apple&quot; are nouns, but &quot;woman&quot; is the subject of the sentence because the sentence is about the action performed by the woman. (If you are curious: &quot;apple&quot; is the direct object of the sentence.)

If we replace the nouns of the example by pronouns, the sentence becomes: &quot;She ate it.&quot; In this example, &quot;she&quot; and &quot;it&quot; are pronouns. The subject of this sentence is the pronoun &quot;she&quot; and therefore this kind of pronoun is called a ''subject pronoun''.

Now that you know about the English subject pronouns, here is a table of them with their German counterparts. Note that ''you'' corresponds to three different words in German, depending on whether you address one or more persons and whether you are using a more formal or more familiar way of addressing them. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Grammar|Subject Pronouns|Subjekt-Pronomina|87|4}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!English||German
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|singular!!1st person
|I
|ich
|-
!2nd person
|you
|du, Sie*
|-
!3rd person
|he, she, it
|er, sie, es
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|plural!!1st person
|we
|wir
|-
!2nd person
|you
|ihr, Sie*
|-
!3rd person
|they
|sie
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Sie'' is the formal (polite) version of ''du'' and ''ihr''. 


{{German/Exercise|Subject pronouns
|Try to translate these English pronouns to German:

# we
# they
# he
# you
# I
# you (formal)
# it
# you guys
# she
|
# wir
# sie
# er
# du
# ich
# Sie (Make sure it's capitalized!)
# es
# ihr
# sie
}}

==Names==
To say the name of someone or something you can use ''to be called'' — ''heißen''. You have already seen some forms of the verb ''heißen''. Here is a more systematic table with all the forms in the present tense. Note that the subject pronouns are capitalized because they start the sentences.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Grammar|Names|Namen|179|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|My name is...||Ich heiße ...
|-
|His/Her/Its name is...||Er/Sie/Es heißt ...
|-
|Their names are...||Sie heißen ...
|-
|Our names are...||Wir heißen ...
|-
|Your name is...||Du heißt ...
|-
|Your names are...||Ihr heißt ...
|-
|What is your name?||Wie heißt du?*
|-
|What are your names?||Wie heißt ihr?*
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Remember, the formal way to ask someone's name is to ask ''Wie heißen Sie?''

'''Note:''' There ''are'' possessive pronouns (e.g. &quot;my&quot;, &quot;your&quot;, &quot;his&quot;, her&quot;, ...) in German, they just don't apply here. For instance, native speakers usually don't say ''Mein Name ist ...'' (''My name is...'').


{{German/Exercise|Names
|Translate to German:
# Hello. My name is ____ (put your name here).
# What is your name?
# My name is Iris. 
# What is his name?
# His name is Andreas.
# What are their names?
# Their names are Gerd and Udo.
# Her name is Eda.
# Its name is Mensch-ärger-dich-nicht. (This is a popular board game in Germany.)
|
# Hallo. Ich heiße ____.
# Wie heißt du? / Wie heißen Sie?
# Ich heiße Iris.
# Wie heißt er?
# Er heißt Andreas.
# Wie heißen sie?
# Sie heißen Gerd und Udo.
# Sie heißt Eda.
# Es heißt Mensch-ärger-dich-nicht.
}}

==Important Verbs==

Verbs are the words that describe the action of a sentence, e.g. ''(to) run'', ''(to) call'', ''(to) be'', etc. ''Conjugation'' refers to changing the form of a verb depending on the subject of a sentence. For example, the verb ''to be'' – ''sein'' has several different forms: ''(I) am...'', ''(you) are...'', ''(he) is...'', etc. Most English verbs, however, have only two forms in the present tense, e.g., ''(I/you/we/they) run'' and ''(he/she/it) runs''. German verbs, on the other hand, have usually several forms in the present tense.

You have already learned the forms of one German verb: ''to be called'' – ''heißen''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Verb|to be called|heißen|229|7|German Verb - heißen.ogg}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!English||German
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|singular!!1st person
|I am called
|ich heiße
|-
!2nd person
|you are called
|du heißt
|-
!3rd person
|he/she/it is called
|er/sie/es heißt
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|plural!!1st person
|we are called
|wir heißen
|-
!2nd person
|you are called
|ihr heißt
|-
!3rd person
|they are called
|sie heißen*
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The form of verbs for ''you (polite)'' — ''Sie'' is exactly the same as for the plural, 3rd person pronoun ''they'' — ''sie''.


Two extremely common verbs are ''to be'' — ''sein'' and ''to have'' — ''haben''. They are conjugated like this:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Verb|to be|sein|76|5|German Verb - sein.ogg}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!English||German
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|singular!!1st person
|I am 
|ich bin
|-
!2nd person
|you are 
|du bist
|-
!3rd person
|he/she/it is 
|er/sie/es ist
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|plural!!1st person
|we are 
|wir sind
|-
!2nd person
|you are 
|ihr seid
|-
!3rd person
|they are 
|sie sind*
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Don't forget that the form for ''you (polite)'' — ''Sie'' is the same as for the plural, 3rd person pronoun ''they'' — ''sie''.


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Verb|to have|haben|140|5|German Verb - haben.ogg}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!English||German
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|singular!!1st person
|I have
|ich habe
|-
!2nd person
|you have
|du hast
|-
!3rd person
|he/she/it has 
|er/sie/es hat
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|plural!!1st person
|we have
|wir haben
|-
!2nd person
|you have
|ihr habt
|-
!3rd person
|they have 
|sie haben*
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;This is also the form for ''you (polite)'' — ''Sie''.


{{German/Exercise|Verbs
|Practice pronouncing the verbs above and making sure they correspond with the proper person. List all of the various forms which you have learned.

==Test==

The test consists of three parts: grammar, vocabulary, and translation. The grammar part is about conjugation; i.e., different forms of verbs for different subject pronouns. The vocabulary and translation problems are all from English to German because this is what you have to learn if you want to communicate in German.

The 26 letters in both German and English are shown above. One, the ligature ''ß'' (''eszett'' or ''scharfes s''), is written as ''SS'' if capitalized; however, it is pronounced just like a normal ''s''. It is only used when the preceding vowel is long, for example: ''der Fuß'' (''the foot''). Note that the ''ß'' is not used in Switzerland. There you always write double ''s'' instead, even after long vowels. For example: ''der Fuss'' (''the foot'').

Another difference between German and English is the '''umlaut'''. The vowels ''a'', ''o'', and ''u'' can take an umlaut (the double dots above), becoming ''ä'', ''ö'', and ''ü''. The umlaut changes the sound of the vowel. For pronunciations of all the letters, go to the [[German/Appendices/Alphabet|pronunciation guide]].  

'''Notes''': 
*In English, the word ''umlaut'' refers to the two dots. The German word ''Umlaut'' usually refers to one of the vowels ''ä'', ''ö'', or ''ü''.
*In German, the vowels ''ä'', ''ö'', and ''ü'' are even used when spelling; i.e., you make the sound of an ''ö'' (like the &quot;u&quot; in &quot;turn&quot;) instead of saying &quot;o umlaut&quot;. Common words used to clarify a given letter are ''Ärger'' (''anger''), ''Ökonom'' (''economist'') and ''Übermut'' (high spirits). To say &quot;umlaut&quot; after the letter is an English custom used when spelling German words in English. 
*If there is no way to type the umlaut, the vowels ''ä'', ''ö'', and ''ü'' must be substituted with ''ae'', ''oe'', and ''ue''. This spelling is also used in some names, e.g. ''Goethe'', or in crosswords.
*In most search engines and online dictionaries, a vowel with umlaut can be entered as either the simple vowel or in vowel-plus-e form. For example, if you wish to find ''Ärger'' you may enter any of the following three search strings: ''Ärger'', ''Aerger'', or even the incorrect ''Arger''. 
*Unless you have a German keyboard with the special German letters, you will have to use one of the following ways to type the umlaut. 
:*On a Macintosh, hold down the ''Option'' key and type “u” (this will create an umlaut), then let go of the ''Option'' key and type the vowel you want to put the umlaut on. The ''Option'' key and “s” will produce ''ß''. 
:*In Windows, you will need to use the ''Alt'' key and numbers from the right side of your keyboard. Windows users also have the option of setting their keyboard settings to “English-international”, which allows them to create umlauts by typing a quotation mark before the umlauted vowel. 
:*Linux users can generally designate a ''Compose'' key using their keyboard configuration options in their system settings (or alternatively if such menu is not available may use commandline programs xmodmap, or setxkbmap), from then on allow the user to enter umlaut letters by pressing the ''Compose'' key plus the ''Double Quotation Mark'' key and then the designated letter. The ''ß'' can also be created by pressing the ''Compose'' key and then pressing the “s” key twice.

==Articles==

In English and German, there are two different types of articles: definite articles (''the'') and indefinite articles (''a'' and ''an''). In German, however, there are different forms of each type of article. Here we discuss only the articles of subject nouns (the most important nouns in sentences, which are in the so-called nominative case). In this case, the form of the article depends only on the ''gender'' and ''number'' (singular or plural) of the noun.

The three genders of German nouns are: '''masculine''' (examples for masculine nouns are ''Junge'' (''boy'') or ''Mann'' (''man'')), '''feminine''' (e.g., ''Frau'' (''woman'') or ''Blume'' (''flower'')) and '''neuter''' (e.g., ''Haus'' (''house'') or ''Mädchen'' (''girl'')). The forms of the definite and indefinite articles for nouns of the three genders are given in the following table. For '''plural''' nouns the definite article is always ''die'' and (as in English) there is no indefinite article for plural nouns.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Lesson I.5: Geburtstag&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
----

==Asking the Time==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Time|Zeit|243|3}}
!||English||German
|-
|||What time is it? (How late is it?)||Wie spät ist es?
|-
|||What time is it? (How much clock is it?)||Wie viel Uhr ist es?
|-
|&lt;small&gt;Ef&lt;/small&gt;||It is 10:15||Es ist zehn Uhr fünfzehn.
|-
|&lt;small&gt;BoA&lt;/small&gt;||It is 10:15||Viertel nach zehn/Viertel elf (Austrian German)
|-
|&lt;small&gt;BoA&lt;/small&gt;||It is 10:45||Viertel vor elf/Dreiviertel elf (Austrian German)
|-
|}

In table above you might have seen the Ef and BoA, those stand for exact form and before or after. Specific times can be expressed in two ways: Exact form (e.g. &quot;Four thirty-seven&quot;) or before or after form (e.g. &quot;Twenty-three to five&quot;).

==Exact form==

This form is the same as English. For example,

*'''Es ist zehn Uhr fünfzehn.'''
:It is 10:15 a.m.
 
*The new word '''Uhr''' means &quot;o'clock&quot;, and is used in all exact times, it comes between the hour and the minute.

*Also, German-speakers generally use the 24-hour clock when expressing time this way, therefore, 3:29 p.m. (15:29) is &quot;fünfzehn Uhr neunundzwanzig.&quot;

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Exact form|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Before or After the Hour==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|BoA|BoA|111|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|After, Past||nach
|-
|Till, to||vor
|-
|quarter||Viertel
|-
|half before||Halb
|}

*Use the same form as in English. For example, 10:57 can be said as, &quot;drei vor elf (three minutes to eleven&quot;. Likewise, 4:10 would be &quot;zehn nach vier (ten minutes past four).&quot; 

*Typically, use the smaller time interval with 'nach' or 'vor'. Don't say, &quot;siebenundfünfzig nach zehn.&quot; 

*You don't need a ''vor'' when using halb. Be careful! In German it's not &quot;half past&quot;, but rather &quot;half to&quot;.  For example, 11:30 can be said as, &quot;Halb zwölf&quot;.

* 5:15 can be said as &quot;Viertel nach fünf&quot; or &quot;Viertel sechs&quot; (Austrian German), 5:45 would be &quot;Viertel vor sechs&quot; or &quot;Dreiviertel sechs&quot; (Austrian German).

'''Note:''' This is only used with informal time telling. You don't use 'Uhr'.

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Before/After the Hour|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Saying When You Do Something===
''Wann spielst du Football?'' (Football means American Football. The much more popular soccer would be &quot;Fußball&quot;, which lit. means Football)

To say you play a sport at a certain time in English, you would answer, &quot;I play football ''at'' 3:30.&quot; This is all the same in German, with the translation of 'at' being ''um''. That makes the above response &quot;Ich spiele Football um halb Vier.&quot; or &quot;Ich spiele Football um fünfzehn Uhr dreißig.&quot;.

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Saying When You Do Something|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Times of Day==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Times of Day|Tageszeiten|364|2}}
!English||German
|-
|the day||der Tag
|-
|today||heute
|-
|tomorrow||morgen
|-
|the day after tomorrow||übermorgen
|-
|yesterday||gestern
|-
|the day before yesterday||vorgestern
|-
|(early) morning||Morgen*
|-
|morning||Vormittag
|-
|afternoon||Nachmittag
|-
|evening||Abend
|-
|night||Nacht
|}

*In German, except the capitalization, the words for &quot;morning&quot; and &quot;tomorrow&quot; are the same: ''morgen''. If you want to say ''tomorrow morning'' use ''morgen früh'' (meaning: ''early on the next day'').

*The words above can be combined into phrases like &quot;gestern Abend&quot;.

*To say &quot;2 days before yesterday&quot; use '''vorvorgestern''' (but 3 days before yesterday won't be ''vorvorvorgestern'')

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Other Time|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Days and Months==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Days|Tage|224|2}}
!English||German
|-
|Monday||Montag
|-
|Tuesday||Dienstag
|-
|Wednesday||Mittwoch
|-
|Thursday||Donnerstag
|-
|Friday||Freitag
|-
|Saturday||Samstag
|-
|Sunday||Sonntag
|}

*Instead of &quot;Samstag&quot; you can say &quot;Sonnabend&quot;, though it is only used in certain parts of the German-speaking world.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Months|Monate|328|2}}
!English||German
|-
|January||Januar/Jänner (Austrian German)
|-
|February||Februar
|-
|March||März
|-
|April||April
|-
|May||Mai
|-
|June||Juni
|-
|July||Juli
|-
|August||August
|-
|September||September
|-
|October||Oktober
|-
|November||November
|-
|December||Dezember
|}

*To say &quot;on Monday&quot;, say ''&quot;am Montag&quot;'' or whatever applies. To say &quot;in January&quot;, say ''&quot;im Januar&quot;'' or whatever applies. This is the same for all of the days and months.

*You can also combine the times of day from earlier with the days of the week. But they're both nouns. To do this, therefore, we must combine the two words into one, as in &quot;Dienstagnacht&quot; (Tuesday night).

'''Culture Note:''' The German week begins on Monday.

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Days and Months|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Dates==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Dates|Daten|305|2}}
!English||German
|-
|first of (''month'')||erster
|-
|second of (''month'')||zweiter
|-
|third of (''month'')||dritter
|-
|fourth of (''month'')||vierter
|-
|seventh of (''month'')||siebter
|-
|eighth of (''month'')||achter
|-
| -th of [''below 20'']||-ter
|-
|tenth of||zehnter
|-
|twentieth of||zwanzigster
|-
|thirty-first of||einunddreißigster
|-
| -th of [''20 to 31'']||-ster
|-
|on (the)||am
|}

*The ordinal numbers from 2 to 19 take the endings ''t''  and from 20 upwards take the ending ''st''

*For example &quot;on the 25th of December&quot;, 
:Simply say &quot;am fünfundzwanzigste'''n''' Dezember.&quot; 
:In other cases you say &quot;fünfundzwanzigste'''r''' Dezember&quot; or &quot;der fünfundzwanzigst'''e''' Dezember&quot;.

*In Germany, dates are written out in the logical order '''''Day'' . ''Month'' . ''Year''''', instead of the American ''Month''/''Day''/''Year''.
:German uses a dot instead of a slash. Do not use the slash in dates, as it is unusual and confusing because you cannot tell if &quot;4/6&quot; means 4th of June (4.6.) or 6th of April (6.4.) 

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Dates|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Birthdays===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Birthdays|Geburtstage|237|2}}
!English||German
|-
|Birthday||Geburtstag
|-
|Happy Birthday||Alles Gute zum Geburtstag!
|-
|Best wishes on your birthday!||Herzlichen Glückwunsch zum Geburtstag!
|-
|Here is your present!||Hier ist dein Geschenk!
|-
|Thank you!||Danke schön!
|-
|That's a nice party!||Das ist eine tolle Party!
|}

*To say, &quot;My birthday is on November 13th&quot;, say, &quot;Ich habe am dreizehnten November Geburtstag.&quot; 
Here ''am dreizehnten November'', ''am 13. November'', ''am dreizehnten elften'' and ''am 13. 11.'' represent the same date.
:Note the order; it translates back literally as &quot;I have on the 13th of November birthday.&quot;

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Birthdays|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Seasons==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Seasons|Jahreszeiten|0|2}}
!English||German
|-
|Spring||der Frühling
|-
|Summer||der Sommer
|-
|Autumn||der Herbst
|-
|Winter||der Winter
|-
|in (the)||im
|}

To say &quot;in Summer&quot;, say &quot;im Sommer&quot;. For example, 

*''Im Sommer spiele ich Baseball.''
:I play baseball in summer.

The time always goes before the verb and the subject. (time, verb, and subject)

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Seasons|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Periods of Time==

If you want to express a certain period of time, but it doesn't have a specific name, like ''Nachmittag'', you can do it like this:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Seasons|Jahreszeiten|0|2}}
!German||Time
|-
|von||Starting Time
|-
|bis||Ending Time
|}

*This is the same as ''from ... till ...'' in English.

*This can also apply with dates. For example, &quot;Wir haben Schule (school) von Montag bis Freitag&quot;.

*'''Exceptions'''
:Wir haben frei vo''m'' fünfundzwanzigsten Dezember bis ''zum'' zweiten Januar.

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Periods of Time|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==How often?==

''Wie oft?'', there are many ways to answer this question. Two are &quot;once, twice, or three times in a ...&quot; or &quot;always, often, or never.&quot;

===A Number or Times===

To say, &quot;once a month&quot;, or &quot;four times a week&quot;, add ''&quot;mal&quot;'' to the end of the number and use the examples below.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Daily|Täglich|0|2}}
!English||German
|-
|Day||''am'' Tag
|-
|Week||''in der'' Woche
|-
|Month||''im'' Monat
|-
|Year||''im'' Jahr
|-
|Weekend||''am'' Wochenende
|-
|Morning||''morgens''
|-
|Evening||''abends''
|-
|Afternoon||''nachmittags''
|-
|Night||''nachts'' oder ''in der'' Nacht
|}

'''For example'''

*''Wir kegeln zweimal in der Woche/zweimal die Woche/zweimal pro Woche.&quot;
:We bowl twice a week.

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#How often?|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Common Adverbs===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Sometimes|Manchmal|0|2}}
!English||German
|-
|always||immer
|-
|most of the time||meistens
|-
|often||oft
|-
|sometimes||manchmal
|-
|seldom||selten
|-
|never||nie
|-
|only||nur
|}

*To apply these words, put them in the sentence, '''after the verb and subject, but before the sport/activity'''. 

*You can also use 'nur' to say things like, ''Sie spielt nur manchmal Tennis.'' 

*Note that if this is translated word-for-word, it becomes, ''She plays only sometimes tennis.'' That's just the way German is.

&lt;big&gt;[[German/Level_I/Freizeit/Problems#Often Adverbs|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Time-Related Words==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Sometimes|Manchmal|0|2}}
!English||German
|-
|Time||die Zeit
|-
|Free time||die Freizeit
|}

*To say you have time, ignore the 'die'. 
*To say when, insert other phrases you have learned this lesson. For example, ''Ich habe am Samstagabend Zeit.''
::Note that the word order is the same as that of birthdays. You can use Freizeit in the same way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Liking==
In English, liking is expressed by using verbs such as &quot;like&quot;, &quot;love&quot; and &quot;enjoy&quot;. In Bengali, it is mainly expressed using the verbs &quot;pôchondo kôra&quot; (=like), &quot;bhalobasha&quot; (=love) and &quot;upobhog kôra&quot; (=enjoy). 

In English, the verbs &quot;like&quot;, &quot;love&quot; and &quot;enjoy&quot; take the finite form (that is, they bear signs of their grammatical relation with the subject) and they are followed by a to-infinitive clause or an -ing clause. For example, &quot;he likes sailing&quot; or &quot;she loves to cook&quot;, or &quot;I enjoy having a cup of tea in the morning&quot;.

In Bengali, the verbs &quot;pôchondo kôra&quot;, &quot;bhalobasha&quot; and &quot;upobhog kôra&quot; take the finite form (that is, they bear signs of their grammatical relation with the subject) and they are preceded by a clause that finishes in a non-finite verb (verb root + suffix &quot;-te&quot;).

How to form a non-finite verb? Take the dictionary form of the verb, such as &quot;pora&quot; (=read), then strip off the final &quot;-a&quot; to get the verb root &quot;por&quot;, and finally add a &quot;-te&quot; in the end to get the non-finite form &quot;porte&quot;. Pora - a + te = porte. This is equivalent to the to-infinitive (&quot;to read&quot;) or the -ing form (&quot;reading&quot;) of the verb in English. 

Observe the following examples.
{|class= wikitable
|-
! English !! Bengali !! Transliteration
|-
| Samia likes reading books.&lt;br /&gt;''or'' Samia likes to read books. || সামিয়া বই পড়তে পছন্দ করে|| Samia boi porte pôchondo kôre.
|-
| Indrani loves cooking.&lt;br /&gt;''or'' Indrani loves to cook. || ইন্দ্রানী রাঁধতে ভালবাসে। || Indrani randhte bhalobashe.
|-
| I enjoy the morning breeze very much. || আমি ভোরের হাওয়াটা খুব উপভোগ করি। || Ami bhorer hawata khub upobhog kori.
|}

==Disliking==
In English, disliking is expressed by using verbs such as &quot;dislike&quot;, &quot;hate&quot; and &quot;loathe&quot;.

==Preference==
In English, preference is expressed by using patterns such as &quot;prefer A to B&quot; or &quot;prefer A rather than B&quot;.

== question ==
why don't u like Microsoft.? and .NET .??

:Microsoft is known to exert anticompetitive practices and .NET is an extension of that strategy (net was a response to Java and a requirement to streamline the Win32 API). Even if it is good for the corporation and its shareholders it has had a extremely nefarious impact in all aspects of software developments and software and protocol interactions. Most obvious is the price engineering and deceiving marketing campaigns the corporation engages in. There is nothing to like about MS in general, most users up until now have been kept hostages on the walled garden created for them.
:Most if not all corporations are evil (a corporation is an entirety created solely for the purpose of obtaining profits for the shareholders, without any other regard besides the word of law) but among them some manage to behave worst that others in relation to the consumers and the environment they operate, even attempting to circumvent the legal requirements. For instance MS was convicted several times of monopolistic practices, so not all is subjective or due to a skewed point of view.

:::That can be argued, I guess that if we accept such practices or in the even that governments are incapable of controlling those entities and work for the benefit of all present and future citizens, we get in a situation of &lt;u&gt;savage capitalism&lt;/u&gt;, that is a bit different of simple capitalism.

infact most of people use VS and its expression edition is completely free and supported both Native and CLR version.
I know you dislike Microsoft :) but give it a shot you may like it probably ;) !
:I do use VS but I don't agree that most people use it but VS and MS does not set the C++ standard in fact it often breaks it :), in any case I do request that when adding content do avoid referring for now to C++0x keywords and if you do never forget to add a note that it will be only available in the C++0x version of the standard.
:Personally I'm aware of the changes but have not used any C++0x innovations in production code.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:34, 13 July 2010 (UTC)

yea I have already added a note ,you can see when I mention about nullptr I said it's  part of C++0x
it may probably useful to people who use VS C++ 2010 version right.? we need to think about
all parties when write an article unless there is a lack diversity.maybe they would think they are considered as ignorance.lolZ
I saw most of new bie people(of course I am some sorta of a new bie, 1st year in college :D)
tend to use VS cause it has a nice interface ,nice coding fonts , and even lot of tools 
personally I have everything QT, VS, wxDEV(the new version), Mono
and I guess QT makes your work easy.

== Signing your posts ==

Hi, Faulknerck, it is recommended that you sign you posts ''after'' them, not before. Instead of this:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~ Hi, I am wondering...&lt;/nowiki&gt;
Which returns:
 [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 15:29, 14 July 2010 (UTC) Hi, I am wondering...

it is recommended to do it like this:

&lt;br/&gt;
well I see what you have contributed to Wikibooks it's upto you if you have requested nothing still it doesn't mean I don't want anything/
in wikipedia they directly say you need to contribute lot of articles to be an admin
but in here they say you don't need any special qualifications ,if any authorities one like he can directly give that to anyone 
probably it can got much easily if have a bureaucrat friend.but I don't have lolz anyway 
at least there is no considerable role still I got , I got nothing so I won't post anything till I get something.
I am not asking money or something I ask a considerable role.and don't think I beg cause I don't want to beg just like a fag  ,If I really want to post anything there are thousand of sites online infact I have never used Wikibooks and don't use and occasionally see it shows up in first pages when I search something. just want to help Wikimedia project cause I have refereed Wikipedia lot.! and thought this place might be good as well, if you want me to leave 
I will leave if you want me to stay then consider my one of requests so I can contribute lot of articles than you realize in my fields
and I saw when I ask the permission to Admin most of people said I don't have a knowledge in Wikibooks rules and regulations and their policies 
and I have just joined . how they know I don't know anything ah.?  I wonder there are magicians on Wikibooks as well,
but that's not a reason to prevent being an admin.! according to administrative requirements any bureaucrat can give that!
and I saw couple of bureaucrats around there. they just ignore me I guess.
you think I ban people like hell and do vandalism works .? nope.. probably that may you think
and there is no reason, and you don't have a proper reason to tell me why I don't need anything ,you just keep saying I have just joined because of that I don't need anything ,infact since I have joined I have posted valuable posts,that's not even that author of that book know probably.it's just the beginning and I didn't join today ,it's 6 or 7 of july so that's a good value for anyone to ask any role.
probably people jealous upon other people or share that among their friends.
and don't teach me how to be an admin I know that well.! and I am NOT a troll.

:Don't take it personally that they didn't give you admin status. I doubt I would get it either. '''&lt;u&gt;You do not need anything to contribute to Wikibooks.&lt;/u&gt;''' This is a volunteer project. It is like a volunteer library that anyone can contribute to, organize, and so forth. If someone walks in, does a little bit, then says &quot;I want to be an admin&quot;, no one is likely to support giving him adminship. Here on Wikibooks, a bureaucrat would likely get kicked out if he gave adminship to someone without consensus. It has nothing to do with knowing a bureaucrat. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 18:26, 16 July 2010 (UTC)
:There are only a few admins out of many active users. And finally, we welcome your help, but &quot;you give me this or I won't help&quot; is not how this community works. People have to prove to the community that they are worthy of getting what they request. Most of the admins had been active for a long time - certainly longer than two weeks - before they got adminship. Also, use the criticism you get in requests for permission constructively, this is something they stress on Wikipedia, and is the same here. Finally, which Wikipedia have you been contributing to? On the English Wikipedia you have a grand total of 44 edits. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 18:38, 16 July 2010 (UTC)

then why people become an admin.???? and the way to become one of them.?
I have never asked from Wikipedia give me the admin-ship cause I know what they have asked from contributors but here it's different they don't have a specific qualification.I know Wikibooks is a public library./
:Adminship is for people who are trusted on Wikibooks to know how the community works very well. That way they don't make wrong decisions. The edit count is a pretty good indicator of their level of experience and involvement in a project. Here, adminship is pretty similar to the way it is on Wikipedia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Set theory ==
The theory of relational databases is built upon the mathematical theory of ''sets''. In mathematics, a set is one of the most general ways of considering more than one object at once, and a substantial amount of theory has been built up to describe this. You won't need to know too much set theory to understand relational databases, but it helps to have the basic concepts straight.

A ''set'' is simply a collection of zero or more objects, all of which are different, without any further structure. The following are all sets:

&lt;math&gt;
\{1, 2, 3\} \qquad
\{a, b\} \qquad
\{-371, r, 4.5\}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the definition says ''zero'' or more: a set with zero members is still a set, even though it is empty. The set with zero elements is written as a pair of empty braces &lt;math&gt;\{\}&lt;/math&gt;, and is often represented by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

If two sets have the exact same elements, then they are the same set. There's nothing special about one set that can distinguish it from others, apart from the elements it contains. The order of the elements isn't important, so the sets are the same no matter what order we choose to write the elements in:

&lt;math&gt;
\{1, 2, 3\} = \{3, 2, 1\}
&lt;/math&gt;

Anything can be put into a set, not just mathematical concepts such as numbers. You could have the set of all US presidents, and deal with it in set theory the same as any other set:

&lt;math&gt;
S = \{\text{George Washington}, \text{John Adams}, ..., \text{Barack Obama}\}
&lt;/math&gt;

Even sets can be members of sets:

&lt;math&gt;
S = \{1, \{red, orange, yellow\}, 42\}
&lt;/math&gt;

Sets can be infinite, for example the set of all positive whole numbers.

== Names and objects ==
Databases are useful when they tell us something about the real world. But things in the real world are dealt with in a fuzzy way that can trip us up when we translate them into a database model.

Names are a good example. When we need to refer to something, we'll give it a name. People don't often think about it, but the name isn't the same thing as the object. &quot;Mark Twain&quot; is a string of characters that we usually use to refer to the author Mark Twain, but the two things aren't the same: &quot;Mark Twain&quot; consists of ten characters, but it's not correct to say that Mark Twain consists of ten characters.

It's also possible for the same object to have several names. &quot;Mark Twain&quot; and &quot;Samuel Clemens&quot; are both strings that can be understood to refer to the author of ''The Adventures of Tom Sawyer''.

This becomes important because you can't put real-world objects into a database, only pieces of information that identify them. You would like to choose identifying information that is unique for each object and can't be confused, but often this is more difficult than it first appears. If your means of identifying objects is fuzzy, then however rigorous your database is the conclusions you draw will still be fuzzy.

== Entities and Classes ==
Databases refer to objects in the real world, but not always in the same way. A database recording sales for a car dealership may track the individual cars that are sold, so that we know exactly which car has been sold to which customer. The database that runs the manufacturer's web site, on the other hand, probably deals with facts about the model lines as a whole, i.e. about the whole ''class'' of such cars.

This is important to be aware of because language doesn't always make it plain. &quot;Joe Smith bought a Ford Mondeo yesterday&quot; uses the same language as &quot;a Ford Mondeo has four wheels&quot;, but the former refers to an individual car, while the latter is a general statement about every Ford Mondeo. The latter statement may even be true if there are no Ford Mondeos in existence (e.g. after the model had been designed, but before one had been manufactured). Don't let the language confuse you, these are entirely different from the point of view of database design.

== Terms ==
There are two sets of relational database terminology in use. The original developers of the relational theory approached it from a theoretical perspective and used terminology that came from set theory and formal logic. These terms never caught on among practitioners, who prefered to use more intuitive and practical terms, which were eventually enshrined in the SQL standard.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- 
! Relational term
! SQL equivalent
|-
| relation, base relvar
| table
|-
| derived relvar
| view, query result, result set
|-
| tuple
| row
|-
| attribute
| column
|}

Most modern publications about databases use the SQL terms as described below, but you should be aware of the different terminology. The pairs of terms are not entirely synonymous, so some writers on relational theory (e.g. Chris Date and Fabian Pascal) prefer to use the strict relational terminology.

=== Domains ===
Domains are the set of allowable data values for a Column.  For example, the '''FiveDigitZipCode''' Column on the ''customer'' entity can be in the ''integer domain''. As such, the database would not allow you to place values like '''123.45''' (floating point) or '''ABC''' (character) into that Column.

Some authors draw a distinction between a ''domain'' and a ''type'' in the fact that a type is a fundamental concept built into the DBMS (e.g. string, integer, floating point) while a domain can have additional business rules about what values are acceptable. For example, if you have a database storing scores in ten-pin bowling, the score for a game will be of integer type, but the rules of the game (it's impossible to score more than 300) mean that the domain of the score would be integers between 0 and 300. The additional constraints on the domain make it harder for bad data to be inserted into the database.

=== Columns ===
Columns are the attributes that describe an entity in the database model.  For example, the ''customer'' entity may have attributes for '''First Name''', '''Last Name''', '''Address''', '''City''', '''State''', and '''FiveDigitZipCode'''.

=== Rows ===
A Row is a complete set of Columns that describe the entity that you are trying to model.

=== Tables ===
Tables are collections of Rows that act as a logical groupings of entities.

=== Databases ===
A collection of related Tables and any supporting objects (e.g. stored procedures) is often referred to as a Database (or schema).  Multiple Databases are usually logically separate from one another.

The term 'database' is sometimes used losely to refer to the software that manages the database. To avoid ambiguity it is standard in more formal contexts to refer to the software as a Database Management System or DBMS—or more specifically a Relational Database Management System or RDBMS.

=== Arity ===
Arity refers to the number of columns in a table. If a table has five columns (as in the case of the ''customer'' entity above), we say it is of arity 5.

=== Cardinality ===
Cardinality refers to the number of elements in a set. In a relational database context, this usually means the number of rows in a table (since a table can be viewed as a set of rows).

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Globalization refers to the expansion and intensification of social relations and consciousness across world-time and world-space.''

Manfred Steger, ''Globalization'' (2010), 18.


'''Why a prehistory of globalization?''' The nature of globalization is so vexing a topic that the wary avoid defining the term much as they would avoid the bubonic plague. By comparison, the historical boundaries of globalization are pretty well agreed upon. It first took shape around 1500 AD, along with the Age of Exploration. Rendering the study of globalizaton even more vexatious by drawing upon &quot;prehistoric&quot; information would seem to be just asking for trouble.

And yet, the effort is manifestly worth making. For one thing, far more attention has been devoted to what globalization is, and what it may become, than to what globalization has actually been. Traditionally, globalization is said to have started around 1500 AD, along with the Age of Exploration. There is an undeniable connection, but the Age of Exploration itself did not just spring forth from a vacuum. Neither, I submit, did globalization.

Scholars have done a lot of important work of finding isolated &quot;globalizations&quot; around the world. But the assumption that &quot;globalization&quot; has existed for more or less five centuries has impeded investigators from seeking out isolated &quot;globalizations&quot; over the course of the fifty-five or so centuries which preceded. Apparently globalization transcends boundaries of space, but not necessarily of time. This is mistaken. Again, globalization did not spring forth from a vacuum. Hence this attempt at a prehistory of globalization.

This diachronic approach of examining all of historical time for signs of globalization will certainly not displace the comparatively synchronic approach of studying the last five centuries. After all, no sane person would suggest that the ancient empires of Egypt, Sumer, Persia, Macedon, or Rome literally shrunk the world the way that modern technology has. But even if it turns out that the ancient world has little or nothing to offer the study of globalization, this too would be a contribution.

So I also feel the whole book suffers from OR such as [[Recreational Drug Use/Ritalin#Trip_Report|user testimonials]], it included [[Recreational Drug Use/Adderal|&quot;tweeked&quot;-ness]], and occasionally list subjective side effects such as [[Recreational Drug Use/DXM|&quot;definite enhancement to music&quot;]], etc.   In addition some of the information given is incorrect (I offer as corroboration the most recent comment on the discussion page), and hence dangerous.  I find this doubly concerning because the book is well written, occasionally cites references, and thus presents the itself as a reliable resource.  

Mostly I would like to make the case that this book falls outside the realm of what should be considered a textbook.  Its goal of educating the user in how to use recreational drugs goes outside the scope of what is taught at any accredited educational institution that I am aware of.

: '''Comment''' I don't know why information in this book couldn't be verified to be true or false. I imagine studies have been done, and recreational drug use is legal in some countries.  Are the cited sources reliable and does the book accurately reflect what the cited sources state? Anyone seeking to be come a medical doctor is likely to need reliable information on this, so they know if a person has overdosed, or if the effects a person is experiencing could be related to drug use or something else. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:23, 18 June 2010 (UTC)
:: '''Comment''' The resources that are cited are frequently other sites on the web which have a similar mission.  I do not consider them particularly reliable, but perhaps others do.  Some of the information, such as classification of different substances is most certainly verifiable. What is more difficult to verify is dosages, as many drugs vary in potency depending on how they are manufactured, it is difficult to accept that constructing a book which indicates safe levels is really possible.  I agree there are probably studies understanding how the human body reacts to the active substances involved, but I don't think they would help with determining quantities of the substances &quot;available on the street&quot;.  As comment in one of the previous RfD's the book hasn't been worked on in quite some time, and it is difficult to check the accuracy of the sites it references as many of the sites are now gone or are themselves equally out of date.  There is also problem of verifying general advise given.  Throughout the book is the theme &quot;You can always take more later&quot; meaning start with a small dose at first and take more as desired.  I can not verify this is bad advise, but I do have anecdotal evidence it might be.  During some conversations with cocaine addicts I know they described to me the phenomenon of being ''on patrol'', which they claim often leads to overdose.  Being on patrol is a situation in which you have a relatively large amount of cocaine, and you do some moderate amount.  While high you become paranoid of being caught with this substance, so you do more.  (The thinking being the faster it is gone the less chance you'll run into police while you have it).  This unfortunately creates a very bad downward spiral.  So I personally think this is dangerous advise, after the first dose your judgment is impaired and you shouldn't attempt to make such serious decisions.  Of course this is my personal opinion which I can verify no more then what is written in the book. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:18, 18 June 2010 (UTC)
::: Maybe the book makes some unstated assumptions. Where recreation use is legal, the streets is not the only place recreation drugs can be obtained. From What I gathered from watching some PBS shows you can often obtain recreation drugs from business vendors or special government distribution centers in places where recreation drug use is legal as a way to guarantee the drugs are safe to use. I imagine those would have safe dosages as well as documented ingredients. Perhaps this is also true of medical marijuana in the United States. Maybe the book ought to recommend that drugs be obtained legally in order to ensure a higher quality and safety of the product? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:58, 18 June 2010 (UTC)

:::: Simply adding a disclaimer to the affect that you should obtain drugs legally would be disingenuous.  Sure if you then make claims about specific doses more accurately, but not all drugs are going to have such a source available, and the pages written are are not based on such sources, and realistically never will be.

:[[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' Whether something is taught at an institution is nice ideally, but I've never seen that explicitly stated in [[WB:WIW]].  Such a definition would call into question many books in [[Subject:Miscellaneous]] and [[Subject:Games]].  As a comparison, there is a book [[How To Build A Pykrete Bong]] that has survived three RFDs, setting a precedent that books on topics illegal in the US jurisdiction ([[Marijuana Cultivation]]) or on topics not necessarily taught at a university ([[How to Solve the Rubik's Cube]]) can reside here.  The latter factor was, apparently, used to purge video game strategy guides, but not consistently applied subsequently.  As for this book, one wonders how much is fact and just how much is fiction. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:19, 18 June 2010 (UTC)

:: To be honest I kind of agree that what is taught at universities is not the best criteria.  I find it difficult to describe but I do think there is a difference in this case.  If I can be vaugue for a minute... While I couldn't find a course on every game listed in [[Subject:Games]] I could cover a lot of them if I spent some time researching.  There are classes on Bridge, Chess, etc. so I feel it isn't a stretch to believe there a course that covers Monopoly (High school economics?)  Just to give an example it wasn't difficult to find a class that discusses [[How to Solve the Rubik's Cube]], just [http://cs.marlboro.edu/courses/fall2008/rubik/home see here].  There is some value judgment that Bridge is a more intellectual game the Poker, so may get classes in one and not the other.  I feel like this book fails to be textbook by a several orders of magnitude.  But I have no good way to suggest that we measure it.  It is not so much the illegality of the subject that bothers me.  But the potential harm to an individuals health the bothers me.  By intending to give explicit advice on how to take drugs, this book must contain a certain amount of unverifiable information.  This book implicitly encourages readers to use drugs and gives them some comfort in making the first step by telling them what is safe.  Eventually the first step will lead to someones death, if it hasn't already.  Yes, there is a disclaimer warning people death is a possibility, but I don't think a disclaimer is strong enough.  By allowing this to stay we are deciding that this type of information is part of wikibooks mission to create educational textbooks.  Just as with the Pykrete bong, it becomes a precedent.  Somehow I feel the difference is that in following the advise on how to build a pykrete bong, or grow a marijuana plant people are not fundamentally placing their lives in danger.  The same is not the case when they take advise on a specific dosage of a given drug. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:17, 18 June 2010 (UTC)

::::: My response to the question of a text on medical prescription drugs is that the two are completely different in terms of verifiability. I personally could easily look up in, say [http://www.amazon.com/Pill-Book-14th-New-Revised/dp/0553593404/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1276880327&amp;sr=8-1 the pill book] if the information here is correct.  Where as in the current book there is no such reference to turn to.  It is in effect the OR of the authors that determine the safe level.  Indeed in some cases it is the &quot;safe level&quot; by which you can exceed the medically safe level listed for a prescription drug.  It is not really a question about liability, I have no concern over anyone getting sued, but this just isn't a textbook.

It is the potential for harm to naive readers that makes apparent medical advice a special case. There is no need for a precedent to be set for the other disclaimers.

:*Regarding content making factual claims that are unsupported by any sources at all, these can be flagged for removal after a period of grace (1 month?).

Doesn't this require the Wikibook to refer directly to the primary sources instead?

[[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment'''s:

1) I don't believe this book falls out of project scope. The subject is valid and the essence of its presentation is acceptable. I should mention that I do not appreciate the last resort &quot;not suitable for an university course&quot; argument, but I won't delve further in that issue in order not to get sidetracked.

2) As for the medical disclaimer issue, it seems quite clear that Wikimedia disclaimers cover all bases when it comes to legal troubles. Beyond the letter of the law, though, it is very understandable why we would like to be cautious about medical advice due to ethical issues. For an analogous situation I am more familiar with, I would certainly object to a &quot;cookbook&quot; of chemistry experiments which did not provide adequate safety advice. It is, however, extremely difficult to find out where to draw the line and define policy (&quot;slippery slope&quot; is the term I would use to describe the situation). In situations of this kind, maybe medical advice can be interpreted in terms of OR - providing detailed medical advice without confirmed medical qualifications or knowledge of the (possible) patients would amount to OR - but I am just speculating. In any case, barring some obviously problematic passages (such as testimonials) I don't think this book is ethically troublesome.

3) That being said, there are quite a few problems with the contents. While many pages are written from an objective and balanced perspective, some do not (the links Thenub provided make good examples). Some loaded terminology (such as &quot;mind-exploring substances&quot;) is liberally sprinkled throughout the book as well, and even the title is not quite adequate in that respect if we want to be strict. And testimonials obviously should not be present. Though not a valid rationale for deletion by any means, an important issue worth mentioning is that the book only covers the (bio)chemistry of psychoactive substances. If it is meant to provide a balanced overview of risks of drug-taking it should also mention intake methods (smoking, injections, etc.).

4) All things considered, I believe there there are valid objections but they do not justify deletion of the book. A clean-up to make the overall package less subjective and closer to NPOV seems pretty feasible, even if done by people without medical or recreational knowledge of the topic - asserting the reliability of all of the contents would be difficult, but effective harm reduction can be done by just trimming the obviously excessive passages. In fact, I am willing to work on it as long as someone else (anyone, really) is willing to collaborate with me in order to promote sound reasoning.

: I wanted to make some small comments in response to Darklama's comment that &quot;since whether WB:OR is true or not is uncertain&quot;.  Consider the page on [[:Drugs:Fact and Fiction/DXM|DXM]], the dosage there far exceeds the usual recommended maximum dosage given on the Cough medicines this page lists as a source.  The dosage given, 600 mg, in is in line with what other pages about taking this drug recreationally suggest.  The time frame is certainly unclear, but given the discussion of hangover the next day it seems like 24 hours is reasonable.  (Corroborated by my cough medicine at home.) Looking up the medical information I find that &quot;coma was reported in an adult who ingested 720 mg over 36 hours (Schneider, 1991).&quot; So if someone taking the dosage here, once a day, they will certainly exceed 720mg per 36 hours.  Now was just one case, maybe it is a statistical aberration.   I don't know, but this book chooses the cut off 600mg not based on any study and in doing so it ignores this particular case history.  How can I verify it is valid to do so? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:18, 19 June 2010 (UTC)

:: Maybe a way to fix pages about drugs that have medical usages which are being used recreationally is to begin by including what is more easy to verify, like its intended use, what is considered to be the maximum safe dosage for medical use, documented side effects, what side effects have been reported when exceeding the maximum safe dosage for medical use, whether the drugs remains in the body or is broken down and how fast, what are considered to be lethal dosages, drug interactions, what combinations of drugs with this one is considered to be lethal, etc. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:28, 19 June 2010 (UTC)

::: I am not sure if you mean that the new page would still recommend a dosage of 600mg to be taken for entertainment value or not.  If the pages contained ''only'' the sort of information you describe perhaps it could be appropriate.  But if it if the book here that is deciding that 600mg (or what ever) is the correct amount to start with, that is not appropriate.  Regardless of the other verifiable information surrounding it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Users are referred to [http://www.macports.org MacPorts].

Be aware that if you use one of the GLPK [[GLPK/Language_Bindings|language bindings]], then the MacPort GLPK version might be out of step with the language binding version. In the fortunate case that the API for both versions remains the same, then this should work. Otherwise you will need to resolve the misalignment somehow.

'''Includes'''

stdio.h &lt;br&gt;
conio.h

'''Type Definitions

Values for TRUE and FALSE to get away from the standard C syntax of just testing for zero / not zero.

'''Function Prototypes'''

Prototype so we don't need to worry about forward references.

'''Global Variables'''

done = loop control in main.&lt;br&gt;
r = denominator(on the right hand side of the operators).&lt;br&gt;
l = numerator (on the left hand side of the operators).

'''Function Definitions'''
init - set global variables.&lt;br&gt;
input_message = prompt for a command.&lt;br&gt;
input = read command.&lt;br&gt;
get_integer = read an integer.&lt;br&gt;
retrieve_keypress = look for a keypress.&lt;br&gt;
validate = make sure the command is one the program can handle.&lt;br&gt;
execute_command = map the command on to the routines to implement it.&lt;br&gt;
output_divide = implement divide '/'.&lt;br&gt;
output_modulus = implement modulus '%'.&lt;br&gt;
output_values = print out l and r.&lt;br&gt;

== LaTeX syntax highlighting ==

MathProg can be set with syntax highlighting under LaTeX.
Download the AMPL syntax file at
[http://puszcza.gnu.org.ua/support/?287 puszcza.gnu.org.ua/support/?287]
and try the following TeX:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\usepackage{listingsutf8}
\usepackage{lstlang0} % syntax file, I added some more keywords like 'display'
\definecolor{CommentCode}{RGB}{20,20,100}

\lstset{
% inputencoding=utf8,
  inputencoding=latin1,
  basicstyle=\ttfamily,
  commentstyle=\color{CommentCode},
  language=ampl,
  breaklines=true
}
\lstinputlisting{PerfectMatching.mprg}
&lt;/source&gt;

Portuguese accents (used in the comments) did not work
under &lt;tt&gt;utf8&lt;/tt&gt;, so the encoding was changed to
&lt;tt&gt;latin1&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Introduction==
Before describing actual storms in all their complexity, this book aims to describe something much simpler:  how the wind blows.  Dynamic meteorology considers atmospheric motions as solutions of the fundamental equations of hydrodynamics: the equations of motion, the equation of continuity, the energy equation, the equation of state, and the equations of continuity for water substance.  This book will develop these equations over the first several chapters.  A rudimentary understanding of dynamic meteorology and atmospheric thermodynamics enables one to study storms: how they form, how they produce significant (and sometimes destructive) weather, and how they dissipate.  

Even before considering the forces in the equation of state, a discussion of kinematics reveals mathematical conventions and vocabulary associated with dynamic meteorology.  


Other systems of equations pertain to the statistical theory of turbulence and other special situations discussed in later chapters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is a guide to all known laptop computer models together with the specifications for each model.

== What is a Laptop? ==

A laptop is a type of portable computer that integrates most of its components including the display screen and keyboard into a single unit of a size suitable for balancing on the lap of the operator or on the side of an armchair. The display screen of a laptop is usually mounted on a hinge and can be folded face down flat over the keyboard for protection and ease of transport.

=== Laptop computers can be powered from a battery pack ===

Most laptop computers can be powered from a battery pack that fits inside the unit. This enabling laptop computers to be used away from mains power for several hours.

'''Kinematic Structures'''

The kinematics branch of dynamics describes the properties of pure motion without regard to force, momentum, or energy--topics discussed in later subchapters.  Kinematic variables include translation, advection, and deformation.  

Meteorologists use various conventions to apply the laws of physics to the atmosphere.  The first set of conventions involves the coordinate system.  Each application may imply or call for a different set of conventions.  Meteorologists use some conventions more commonly than others and sometimes choose conventions for the problem at hand or to comport with those utilized in available tools.  In confusing situations, meteorologists use multiple incompatible conventions simultaneously.  

== Coordinate systems ==
A [[w:coordinate system|coordinate system]] or [[w:frame of reference|reference frame]] uniquely identifies each point of the atmosphere (or any other continuum).  The atmosphere of the earth mostly concentrates in a very thin shell around an almost spherical planet earth, making traditional inertial reference frames mathematically difficult to apply to the equations of atmospheric dynamics.  

=== Measuring distance: meters ===
The [[w:position (vector)|position vector]] leads from the origin of the coordinate system to a point in space, thus specifying the position of this point relative to the chosen coordinate system.  In any coordinate system, at least one specified component of the position vector must have dimensions of length and hence fundamental units of [[w:metre|meter]]s in [[w:International System of Units|International System of Units (&lt;i&gt;le Système international d'unités&lt;/i&gt;, SI)]].  

The Revolutionary French originally devised the International System of Units, hence its French name and acronym.  The French Academy of Sciences in 1791 defined the meter such that ten million meters along a meridian of constant longitude equal the length of one quadrant, the shortest distance along the surface of the earth from the Equator to the North Pole through Paris, France.  According to this definition, the circumference of the spherical earth--four times the distance along the surface of the earth from the Equator to the North Pole--equals 40 million meters (40×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m or 40,000 km).  Because the circumference of a circle (a slice through the center of the earth) equals &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; times the radius of the earth &lt;math&gt;R_{earth}&lt;/math&gt; would equal &lt;math&gt;\frac{40 \times 10^6 \mbox{ m}}{2\pi}\approx 6,366,197 \mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt;.  

To enable the use of the meter in practical applications, the French scientists who defined the meter made a particular metal bar exactly one meter in length.  A slight error in their estimate of meridional circumference of the earth left the bar 0.2 mm too short for the corresponding definition of the meter.  The meridional circumference of the earth, the original basis for the old definition of the meter, measures 40,008.00 km.  The earth does not take the form of a perfect sphere; its equatorial circumference measures a slightly wider 40,075.16 km.  The radius of the earth actually varies with latitude from 6356.8 km at the poles to 6378.1 km at the equator.  The official bar changed from a brass prototype in 1795 to a platinum one in 1799.   In 1889, the first General Conference on Weights and Measures defined the meter officially as the distance between two lines on a particular bar of an alloy of platinum with ten percent iridium, measured at the melting point of ice.  

In 1960, this official definition changed to make one meter equal to 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in a vacuum.  In 1983, the conference redefined the meter to make the speed of light in a vacuum exactly equal to 299,792,458 m/s (meters per second).  The speed of light in a vacuum thus now provides the official definition of the meter.  

==== Prefixes ====
To express very large and very small lengths, scientists use scientific notation and prefixes.  These prefixes also apply to any other units within the International System of Units.  In the United States of America, the Constitution gives the Congress the power to &quot;fix the standard of weights and measures&quot;, and National Institute of Standards and Technology implements various acts of Congress dealing with weights and measures.  The units used in this book conform to this implementation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nist.gov/physlab/pubs/sp811/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Other acceptable units ====

Scientists occasionally use alternative units beyond those in the International System of Units.  For length, these include the astronomical unit (ua), approximately the mean distance between the earth and the sun.  Technically defined as the radius of an unperturbed circular Newtonian orbit about the Sun of a particle of infinitesimal mass, moving with a mean motion of 0.017 202 098 95 radians per day (Gaussian constant), one astronomical unit approximately equals 149.597 870 691 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; m.  

When describing the atomic unit, scientists occasionally use the Bohr radius (&lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt;) as a unit of length

Meteorologists (and mariners) frequently use the [[w:nautical mile|nautical mile]], traditionally defined as the distance along the surface of the earth corresponding to one arc minute of latitude.  The actual distance so corresponding varies somewhat with latitude.  International agreement defined the nautical mile as exactly 1852 m in 1929; the United States of America adopted this definition in 1954; earlier documents may use a slightly different interpretation.  Sixty arc minute of latitude correspond to one arc degree of latitude; ninety arc degrees of latitude constitute the quarter-circumference of the earth originally used to define the meter.  Mathematically, 1852 m × 90 × 60 × 4 = 40,003,200 m, slightly more than the actual meridional circumference of the earth.  

==== Unacceptable units ====

Unacceptable units of length, sometimes encountered in publications, include fermi for 10&lt;sup&gt;-15&lt;/sup&gt; m = 1 fm (femtometer) and the micron (&amp;mu;) for 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; m = 1 &amp;mu;m (micrometer).  

==== Customary units ====

One meter equals 3.2808399 feet or 39.370079 inches.

=== Cartesian coordinate systems ===

=== Angular units ===

=== Curvilinear coordinate systems ===
A [[w:spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinate system]], approximating the earth as a sphere, represents every point according to its [[w:latitude|latitude]] {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, [[w:longitude|longitude]] {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/VAR&gt;}}, and distance {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;r&lt;/VAR&gt;}} from the center of the earth.  


Cartographers use maps to represent the surface of the spherical planet on a flat sheet of paper.  Meteorologists likewise can adapt the equations of motion to Cartesian coordinates used in maps.  

=== Eulerian coordinates ===
An Eulerian coordinate system refers to points in physical space.  

=== Lagrangian coordinates ===
A Lagrangian coordinate system follows a parcel of moving air.

      <comment>/* GLPSOL usage */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Interoperability, in this case, refers to the ability to translate between and/or use common linear and mixed integer '''problem specification formats''' under GLPK. These formats are used to present and archive problem instances. The notion of a problem format should ''not'' be confused with that of a high-level modeling language, such as GLPK MathProg. This page also considers the '''solution recovery formats''' provided by GLPK and gives information on the '''machine processing''' of GLPK output.

== Overview ==

GLPK can readily input and output problems in various problem specification formats:

* the '''[[w:CPLEX|CPLEX&amp;nbsp;LP]]''' format (includes MIP problems)
* the '''[[w:MPS_(format)|MPS]]''' format in fixed (ancient) and free (modern) variants
* a custom '''[[w:DIMACS|DIMACS]]'''-like format named '''GLPK''' format.

This means GLPK can be used to create problems for other solvers. And can take problems from other sources and either reformat them or solve them. This functionality is available through both GLPSOL and the GLPK callable library. Indeed some users employ GLPK solely for its model generation and problem reformatting features &amp;mdash; and never actually invoke the underlying solver.

GLPK is not able to write back results to these formats in cases where the underlying format specification provides for this.  Users must rely on the native GLPK solution output instead. Nor does GLPK currently support any of the [[w:XML|XML]]-based optimization formats &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Fourer | first1 = Robert | last2 = Lopes | first2 = Leo | last3 = Martin | first3 = Kipp | year = 2005 | title = LPFML: A W3C XML Schema for Linear and Integer Programming | periodical = INFORMS Journal on Computing | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 139-158 | doi = 10.1287/ijoc.1040.0120}}&lt;/ref&gt; including that developed as part of the [http://projects.coin-or.org/OS COIN-OR OS] (Optimization Services) project.

In addition, GLPK offers several [[w:Graph_(mathematics)|graph]] reading and writing routines which make use of the DIMACS clique/coloring format and also a custom GLPK plain text format. These API routines are not currently available through GLPSOL and are not discussed further.

Earlier versions of GLPK have supported the OPB pseudo-boolean format.

The following file extension conventions normally apply:

&lt;table border=0 style=&quot;margin-top: 2ex; margin-bottom: 3ex&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;font-weight: bold; background-color: lightgray&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;Format&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;File extension&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;CPLEX&amp;nbsp;LP&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;.lp&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;MPS&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;.mps&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;fixed and free&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;GLPK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;.glp&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;tt&gt;.glpk&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The [[GLPK/Literature#Official_GLPK_documentation|official GLPK documentation]] gives full details of each supported format.

Finally, an example of [[#GLPSOL_sensitivity_analysis|sensitivity analysis]] is included on this page although
it is not really an interoperability issue.  Sensitivity analysis interpretation keys are given in
the [[GLPK/Solution_information#glp_print_ranges|glp_print_ranges]] entry.

== GLPSOL usage ==

GLPSOL offers convenient command-line usage for achieving interoperability. A review of the help message from GLPSOL makes a good starting point.

The following table summarizes the relevant interoperability options (the MathProg column is included for completeness):&lt;ref&gt;The obsolete option &lt;tt&gt;--wcpxlp&lt;/tt&gt; is equivalent to &lt;tt&gt;--wlp&lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;table border=0 style=&quot;margin-top: 2ex; margin-bottom: 3ex&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;font-weight: bold; background-color: lightgray&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; background-color: white&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;CPLEX&amp;nbsp;LP&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;MPS fixed&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;MPS free&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;GLPK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;MathProg&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold; background-color: lightgrey&quot;&gt;Read&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;--lp&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;--mps&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;--freemps&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;--glp&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;--math&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold; background-color: lightgrey&quot;&gt;Write&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;--wlp ''filename''&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;--wmps ''filename''&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;--wfreemps ''filename''&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;--wglp ''filename''&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;not possible&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

As indicated, it is not generally possible to create a high-level model from a lower-level problem format. That said, the CPLEX&amp;nbsp;LP format is the most human legible.

The following example reads in an existing &lt;tt&gt;convert.lp&lt;/tt&gt; CPLEX&amp;nbsp;LP format file and outputs a GLPK format file ''without'' solving the model. In this case, the &lt;tt&gt;--check&lt;/tt&gt; option prevents the model from being run.

&lt;pre&gt;
$ glpsol --check --wglp convert.glp --lp convert.lp 
&lt;/pre&gt;

The GLPSOL options for solution capture comprise:

&lt;table border=0 style=&quot;margin-top: 2ex; margin-bottom: 3ex&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;font-weight: bold; background-color: lightgray&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; background-color: white&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;Printable format&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;Plain text format&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; font-weight: bold; background-color: lightgrey&quot;&gt;Recover&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;--output ''filename''&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;--write ''filename''&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The printable format is designed to be understood by humans. The plain text format is for machine processing. Neither format represents an established standard. A copy of the terminal output can also be written to file using the &lt;tt&gt;--log&lt;/tt&gt; option. Hence:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ glpsol --output example.out --log example.log --math example.mod 
&lt;/pre&gt;

The same functionality provided by GLPSOL is also available through API routines from the GLPK callable library.

Again the [[GLPK/Literature#Official_GLPK_documentation|official GLPK documentation]] gives full details of each format.

== Machine processing GLPK output ==

Users may wish to automatically process the output from GLPK.  But GLPK cannot produce common machine-parsable formats like [[w:Comma-separated_values|CSV]] (comma-separated values) or [[w:XML|XML]] or specialized dialects based on these two protocols.  Instead, the GLPK maintainer advises:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;To access the solution found by GLPSOL from a computer program, one could
write the model with the &lt;tt&gt;--wglp&lt;/tt&gt; option and the solution with the &lt;tt&gt;--write&lt;/tt&gt; option.
The ''ordering of rows and columns is the same in both files''. It is enough
to obtain all necessary information. (The only improvements I would like
to make here is to use a DIMACS-like format for solution files.)&quot;
''Source'': [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-glpk/2011-01/msg00048.html &amp;#91;help-glpk&amp;#93;, 19&amp;nbsp;Jan 2011], grammar corrected, emphasis added.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

See elsewhere on this page for representative output from these two GLPSOL options.

The same output can also be generated using the appropriate API calls, namely: &lt;tt&gt;glp_write_sol&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;glp_write_ipt&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;glp_write_mip&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;glp_write_prob&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Short examples ==

This section uses the &lt;tt&gt;short.mod&lt;/tt&gt; model, first introduced on the [[GLPK/GMPL_(MathProg)#Short_example|MathProg]] page. Save the following model in a file named &lt;tt&gt;short.mod&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;pre&gt;
# short example
var x1;
var x2;
maximize obj: 0.6 * x1 + 0.5 * x2;
s.t. c1: x1 + 2 * x2 &lt;= 1;
s.t. c2: 3 * x1 + x2 &lt;= 2;
solve;
display x1, x2;
end;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Astute readers may notice that this model does not contain ''advanced'' MathProg language features and thus looks much like a problem format (the &lt;tt&gt;solve&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;display&lt;/tt&gt; statements excepted).

A selection of calls and results are given next. This exercise also provides a useful visual comparison of these various formats.

      <text xml:space="preserve">My name is Breannan Finlayson,
I live in Victoria, Australia with my parents and two of my three sisters, along with one of my sisters boyfriends.
I am a junior at the Grange high school and have a future goal of becoming a coroner.
My family, along with most, comes with difficulties, but as a family, we manage to successfully  avoid eny major most problems.
I love my family to peices, but they can sometimes get on my nerves.
I have four best friends, named Tiffany, Sophie, Samantha and Corey.
I recently attended Hoppers Crossing Secondary Collage as a first year, although i loved that school, problems arouse that made me and one of my sisters(the sister i do not live with eny more) to leave the school.
I still hope that one day I will return to that school and graduate from their.
I also hope that maybe one day in the near future i will find out how it feels to be in love and to actually have that love returned to mke.
I have once had my heart broken by a guy who i thought would always be in my life, my best friend Corey, and althoough we do not talk to each other eny more, for problems that came about in out first year of high school, I still count him as my best friend and probebly always will.

I also would like to say that I am one of the only people in the world my age who is pround to say that, even though I might be embarrassed by them at some times, I would not have my family eny other way</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This tutorial contains a set of examples demonstrating the features of competitive [[w:Electricity_market|electricity markets]] used for market-based dispatch. Although the [[w:National_Electricity_Market|Australian National Electricity Market]] (NEM) is used as the reference for these examples, this market shares many characteristics with other competitive electricity markets and can offer useful insights into marked-based dispatch more generally.

Single-period electricity dispatch may be framed as a [[w:Flow_network|flow network]] problem &amp;mdash; with each region (and later, each transmission line) represented by a node and each loss-free link represented by a bi-directional arc. The examples presented here are ''instead'' constructed as [[w:Linear_programming|linear programs]]. The two formulations are mathematically equivalent (although the preferred algorithms normally differ). Nonetheless, it is useful to retain a network view in mind as you study these examples.

Regarding comments and improvements, please contact Dr. Harley Mackenzie [HARD software] at [mailto:hjm@hardsoftware.com hjm@hardsoftware.com].  I welcome your input.

== Simple single unit dispatch ==

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate the dispatch of a single generation unit for a defined regional price over a series of time periods, taking account of fuel costs and ramp rates, and maximising the total profit for the unit.

&lt;pre&gt;

# set of dispatch intervals

set I;

# dispatch price is $

param regionalprice {I};

# unit characteristics

param unit_max_capacity &gt;= 0;
param fuel_cost &gt;= 0;
param max_ramp_rate &gt;= 0;
param start_dispatch &gt;= 0;

# dispatch variables

var dispatch {I} &gt;= 0;
var ramp {I}, &gt;= - max_ramp_rate, &lt;= max_ramp_rate;
var profit {I};

# objective function

maximize totalprofit: sum {i in I} profit[i];

# constraints

s.t. initial_dispatch: dispatch[0] = start_dispatch;
s.t. dispatch_profit {i in I}: profit[i] = 
  dispatch[i] * (regionalprice[i] - fuel_cost);
s.t. dispatch_ramp {i in I}: ramp[i] = 
  dispatch[i] - dispatch[if i &gt; 0 then i-1 else 0];
s.t. unit_capacity {i in I}: dispatch[i] &lt;= 
  unit_max_capacity;

# solve the problem

solve;

# output input and determined values

printf {i in I} &quot;%d regionalprice = %.1f; dispatch = %.1f; ramp = %.1f; profit = %.1f\n&quot;, 
i, regionalprice[i], dispatch[i], ramp[i], profit[i];

data;

param unit_max_capacity := 100;  /* MW */
param fuel_cost := 30;           /* $/MWh */
param max_ramp_rate := 20;       /* max MW up or down */
param start_dispatch := 0;       /* present dispatch point MW */

param : I :   regionalprice :=
         0     15
         1     17
         2     18
         3     22
         4     55
         5     40
         6     65
         7     10
         8     12
         9      4
;

end;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The solution is found in about 10 iterations and shows the dispatch of the unit prior to profitable running to maximise the total profit of $2680 for the entire set of time periods. Unfortunately in the real world, the regional price is not known prior to the dispatch interval and so the approach is only useful for the analysis of optimal dispatch after the dispatch has occurred or, in the case of pre-dispatch pricing, with the implicit assumption that the dispatch of the unit is insignificant with respect to the regional price.

== Single region energy dispatch with regulation ==

This example is similar to the previous example but introduces the complication of a market dispatched ancillary service for system regulation. In the real Australian NEM, there are six market dispatched services for raises of 6 seconds (R6SEC), 60 seconds (R60SEC), 5 minutes (R5MIN) and regulation (RREG) and for lowers of 6 seconds (L6SEC), 60 seconds (L60SEC), 5 minutes (L5MIN) and regulation (LREG). In this example, only the RREG service is considered for a single region where the market cost for the region is minimised. The example does not consider real world constraints regarding the dispatch of ancillary services where varying amounts of service are available at different output levels, implemented in the Australian market as a defined trapezium for each ancillary service and the physical characteristics of each unit.

&lt;/pre&gt;

The results show that the (electrical) energy dispatch for the region is influenced by the provision of the ancillary service therefore leads to a higher total market cost than if just energy were considered. Note that the additional of the regulation service has lead to a dispatch that is not obvious if only examining the energy dispatch.

== Two region energy dispatch ==

In this example we look at the dispatch of two regions given varying capacity at different price bands in each region and different regional demand for a single time period. The objective function seeks to find the lowest cost solution for both regions. For this example it is assumed that there are no link losses between each region. Energy in this context refers to electrical energy.

&lt;/pre&gt;

The solution shows the dispatch in each region, with the link running at full capacity due to the lower demand and lower cost of generation in region A.

== Modeling of quadratic line losses ==

Losses in transmission lines are quadratic of the form &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;flow&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and therefore need to be approximated with a linear form for solving with an LP formulation. The way to approach the problem is to approximate the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;flow&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with the formulation: &lt;math&gt;\sum_N a_i z_i&lt;/math&gt; subject to &lt;math&gt;\sum_N z_i = flow&lt;/math&gt; This is an example of separable programming being used to approximate a convex non-linear function (see HP Williams ‘Model Building in Mathematical Programming’&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=H. Paul|title = Model Building in Mathematical Programming|publisher = Wiley|year = 1999|isbn = 978-0-471-99788-7|ref=Wil99}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Chapter on non-linear models). Separable functions are functions which can be broken down into single variable functions, and these in turn can be approximated by piecewise linear functions.  

{{TODO|• upload graph image file of losses and linear approximation}}

For the GLPK formulation, I have modeled both positive and negative flows over the link to check that it works correctly for flow in both directions. It is very easy to confuse the signs and to get this wrong, so checking both flows is a good check for the technique. This technique will be required for all of the inter-connector flows between regions and so will need to be correct for later more sophisticated models.

[[Image:LDAutoXRFPic.jpg|thumb|350px|right|A Philips PW1606 X-ray fluorescence spectrometer with automated sample feed in a cement plant quality control laboratory]]
'''X-ray fluorescence (XRF)''' is the emission of characteristic &quot;secondary&quot; (or fluorescent) [[X-rays]] from a material that has been excited by bombarding with high-energy X-rays or [[gamma rays]]. The phenomenon is widely used for [[elemental analysis]] and [[analytical chemistry|chemical analysis]], particularly in the investigation of [[metal]]s, [[glass]], [[ceramic]]s and building materials, and for research in [[geochemistry]], [[forensic science]] and [[archaeology]].

==The physics of XRF==
[[File:X-ray fluorescence simple figure.svg|thumb|340px|Physics of X-ray fluorescence, in a schematic representation.]]

When materials are exposed to short-[[wavelength]] X-rays or to gamma rays, ionisation of their component [[atom]]s may take place. Ionisation consists of the ejection of one or more electrons from the atom, and may take place if the atom is exposed to radiation with an energy greater than its [[Ionization energy|ionisation potential]]. X-rays and gamma rays can be energetic enough to expel tightly held electrons from the inner [[atomic orbital|orbital]]s of the atom. The removal of an electron in this way renders the electronic structure of the atom unstable, and electrons in higher orbitals &quot;fall&quot; into the lower orbital to fill the [[electron hole|hole]] left behind. In falling, energy is released in the form of a photon, the energy of which is equal to the energy difference of the two orbitals involved. Thus, the material emits radiation, which has energy characteristic of the atoms present. The term ''[[fluorescence]]'' is applied to phenomena in which the absorption of radiation of a specific energy results in the re-emission of radiation of a different energy (generally lower).

[[Image:CharacteristicRadiation.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 1: Electronic transitions in a calcium atom. Remember, when electrons are jumping down, one of the electrons in the lower orbital is missing.]]
[[Image:XRFScan.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 2: Typical energy dispersive XRF spectrum]]
[[Image:TubeSpectrum.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 3: Spectrum of a rhodium target tube operated at 60 kV, showing continuous spectrum and K lines]]
===Characteristic radiation===
Each element has electronic orbitals of characteristic energy. Following removal of an inner electron by an energetic photon provided by a primary radiation source, an electron from an outer shell drops into its place. There are a limited number of ways in which this can happen, as shown in figure 1. The main transitions are given names: an L→K transition is traditionally called Kα, an M→K transition is called Kβ, an M→L transition is called Lα, and so on. Each of these transitions yields a fluorescent photon with a characteristic energy equal to the difference in energy of the initial and final orbital. The wavelength of this fluorescent radiation can be calculated from [[Planck postulate|Planck's Law]]:

&lt;math&gt; \lambda = h \cdot c/E&lt;/math&gt;

The fluorescent radiation can be analysed either by sorting the energies of the photons (energy-dispersive analysis) or by separating the wavelengths of the radiation (wavelength-dispersive analysis). Once sorted, the intensity of each characteristic radiation is directly related to the amount of each element in the material. This is the basis of a powerful technique in [[analytical chemistry]]. Figure 2 shows the typical form of the sharp fluorescent spectral lines obtained in the wavelength-dispersive method (see [[Moseley's law]]).

===Primary radiation===
In order to excite the atoms, a source of radiation is required, with sufficient energy to expel tightly held inner electrons. Conventional [[X-ray generators]] are most commonly used, because their output can readily be &quot;tuned&quot; for the application, and because higher power can be deployed relative to other techniques. However, gamma ray sources can be used without the need for an elaborate power supply, allowing an easier use in small portable instruments. When the energy source is a [[synchrotron]] or the X-ray are focussed by an optic like a [[polycapillary]], the X-ray beam can be very small and very intense. As a result, atomic information on the sub-micrometer scale can be obtained. X-ray generators in the range 20–60 kV in order to the K line, which allows excitation of a broad range of atoms. The continuous spectrum consists of &quot;[[bremsstrahlung]]&quot; radiation: radiation produced when high energy electrons passing through the tube are progressively decelerated by the material of the tube anode (the &quot;target&quot;). A typical tube output spectrum is shown in figure 3.

===Dispersion===
In energy dispersive analysis, the fluorescent X-rays emitted by the material sample are directed into a solid-state detector which produces a &quot;continuous&quot; distribution of pulses, the voltages of which are proportional to the incoming photon energies. This signal is processed by a multichannel analyser (MCA) which produces an accumulating digital spectrum that can be processed to obtain analytical data. In wavelength dispersive analysis, the fluorescent X-rays emitted by the material sample are directed into a diffraction grating monochromator. The diffraction grating used is usually a single crystal. By varying the angle of incidence and take-off on the crystal, a single X-ray wavelength can be selected. The wavelength obtained is given by the [[Bragg's Law|Bragg Equation]]:

&lt;math&gt; n \cdot \lambda = 2 d \cdot \sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is the spacing of atomic layers parallel to the crystal surface.

===Detection===
In energy dispersive analysis, dispersion and detection are a single operation, as already mentioned above. [[Proportional counter]]s or various types of solid state detectors ([[PIN diode]], Si(Li), Ge(Li), [[Silicon Drift Detector]] SDD) are used. They all share the same detection principle: An incoming X-ray [[photon]] ionises a large number of detector atoms with the amount of charge produced being proportional to the energy of the incoming photon. The charge is then collected and the process repeats itself for the next photon. Detector speed is obviously critical, as all charge carriers measured have to come from the same photon to measure the photon energy correctly (peak length discrimination is used to eliminate events that seem to have been produced by two X-ray photons arriving almost simultaneously). The spectrum is then built up by dividing the energy spectrum into discreet bins and counting the number of pulses registered within each energy bin. [[Wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|EDXRF]] detector types vary in resolution, speed and the means of cooling (a low number of free charge carriers is critical in the solid state detectors): proportional counters with resolutions of several hundred eV cover the low end of the performance spectrum, followed by [[PIN diode]] detectors, while the Si(Li), Ge(Li) and Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD) occupy the high end of the performance scale.

In wavelength dispersive analysis, the single-wavelength radiation produced by the monochromator is passed into a [[photomultiplier]], a detector similar to a [[Geiger counter]], which counts individual photons as they pass through. The counter is a chamber containing a gas that is ionised by X-ray photons. A central electrode is charged at (typically) +1700 V with respect to the conducting chamber walls, and each photon triggers a pulse-like cascade of current across this field. The signal is amplified and transformed into an accumulating digital count. These counts are then processed to obtain analytical data.

===X-ray intensity===

The fluorescence process is inefficient, and the secondary radiation is much weaker than the primary beam. Furthermore, the secondary radiation from lighter elements is of relatively low energy (long wavelength) and has low penetrating power, and is severely attenuated if the beam passes through air for any distance. Because of this, for high-performance analysis, the path from tube to sample to detector is maintained under high vacuum (around 10 Pa residual pressure). This means in practice that most of the working parts of the instrument have to be located in a large vacuum chamber. The problems of maintaining moving parts ''in vacuo'', and of rapidly introducing and withdrawing the sample without losing vacuum, pose major challenges for the design of the instrument. For less demanding applications, or when the sample is damaged by a vacuum (e.g. a volatile sample), a helium-swept X-ray chamber can be substituted, with some loss of low-Z (Z = [[atomic number]]) intensities.

==XRF in chemical analysis==

The use of a primary X-ray beam to excite fluorescent radiation from the sample was first proposed by [[Richard Glocker|Glocker]] and [[Hans-Wilhelm Schreiber|Schreiber]] in 1928&lt;ref&gt;Glocker, R., and Schreiber, H., ''Ann. Physik.'', '''85''' (1928), p. 1089&lt;/ref&gt;. Today, the method is used as a non-destructive analytical technique, and as a process control tool in many extractive and processing industries. In principle, the lightest element that can be analysed is [[beryllium]] (Z = 4), but due to instrumental limitations and low X-ray yields for the light elements, it is often difficult to quantify elements lighter than [[sodium]] (Z = 11), unless background corrections and very comprehensive interelement corrections are made.

[[Image:dmedxrfschematic.jpg|thumb|600px|Figure 4: Schematic arrangement of EDX spectrometer]]
===Energy dispersive spectrometry===
In [[energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|energy dispersive]] spectrometers (EDX or EDS), the detector allows the determination of the energy of the photon when it is detected. Detectors historically have been based on silicon semiconductors, in the form of lithium-drifted silicon crystals, or high-purity silicon wafers.

[[Image:DmedxrfSiLiDetector.jpg|thumb|350px|Figure 5: Schematic form of a Si(Li) detector]]
====Si(Li) detectors====
These consist essentially of a 3–5&amp;nbsp;mm thick silicon junction type p-i-n diode (same as PIN diode) with a bias of -1000 V across it. The lithium-drifted centre part forms the non-conducting i-layer, where Li compensates the residual acceptors which would otherwise make the layer p-type.  When an X-ray photon passes through, it causes a swarm of electron-hole pairs to form, and this causes a voltage pulse. To obtain sufficiently low conductivity, the detector must be maintained at low temperature, and liquid-nitrogen must be used for the best resolution. With some loss of resolution, the much more convenient Peltier cooling can be employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=667SJf95AFAC&amp;pg=PA559|page=559|title=Transmission electron microscopy: a textbook for materials science, Volume 2|author=David Bernard Williams, C. Barry Carter|publisher=Springer|year=1996|isbn=030645324X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wafer detectors====
More recently, high-purity silicon wafers with low conductivity have become routinely available. Cooled by the Peltier effect, this provides a cheap and convenient detector, although the [[liquid nitrogen]] cooled Si(Li) detector still has the best resolution (i.e. ability to distinguish different photon energies).

====Amplifiers====
The pulses generated by the detector are processed by [[pulse-shaping]] amplifiers. It takes time for the amplifier to shape the pulse for optimum resolution, and there is therefore a trade-off between resolution and count-rate: long processing time for good resolution results in &quot;pulse pile-up&quot; in which the pulses from successive photons overlap. Multi-photon events are, however, typically more drawn out in time (photons did not arrive exactly at the same time) than single photon events and pulse-length discrimination can thus be used to filter most of these out. Even so, a small number of pile-up peaks will remain and pile-up correction should be built into the software in applications that require trace analysis. To make the most efficient use of the detector, the tube current should be reduced to keep multi-photon events (before discrimination) at a reasonable level, e.g. 5–20%.

====Processing====
Considerable computer power is dedicated to correcting for pulse-pile up and for extraction of data from poorly resolved spectra. These elaborate correction processes tend to be based on empirical relationships that may change with time, so that continuous vigilance is required in order to obtain chemical data of adequate precision.

====Usage====
[[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|EDX]] spectrometers are superior to [[Wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|WDX]] spectrometers in that they are smaller, simpler in design and have fewer engineered parts. They can also use miniature X-ray tubes or gamma sources. This makes them cheaper and allows miniaturization and portability. This type of instrument is commonly used for portable quality control screening applications, such as testing toys for Lead (Pb) content, sorting scrap metals, and measuring the lead content of residential paint. On the other hand, the low resolution and problems with low count rate and long dead-time makes them inferior for high-precision analysis. They are, however, very effective for high-speed, multi-elemental analysis. Field Portable XRF analysers currently on the market weigh less than 2&amp;nbsp;kg, and have limits of detection on the order of 2 parts per million of Lead (Pb) in pure sand.

[[File:XRFgoniometer manual.jpg|thumb|right|Chemist operates a [[goniometer]] used for X-ray fluorescence analysis of individual grains of mineral specimens, [[U.S. Geological Survey]], 1958.]]

===Wavelength dispersive spectrometry===
In [[wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|wavelength dispersive]] spectrometers ([[WDX]] or [[Wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|WDS]]), the photons are separated by [[diffraction]] on a single crystal before being detected. Although wavelength dispersive spectrometers are occasionally used to scan a wide range of wavelengths, producing a spectrum plot as in EDS, they are usually set up to make measurements only at the wavelength of the emission lines of the elements of interest. This is achieved in two different ways:

*'''&quot;Simultaneous&quot; spectrometers''' have a number of &quot;channels&quot; dedicated to analysis of a single element, each consisting of a fixed-geometry crystal monochromator, a detector, and processing electronics. This allows a number of elements to be measured simultaneously, and in the case of high-powered instruments, complete high-precision analyses can be obtained in under 30 s. Another advantage of this arrangement is that the fixed-geometry monochromators have no continuously moving parts, and so are very reliable. Reliability is important in production environments where instruments are expected to work without interruption for months at a time. Disadvantages of simultaneous spectrometers include relatively high cost for complex analyses, since each channel used is expensive. The number of elements that can be measured is limited to 15–20, because of space limitations on the number of monochromators that can be crowded around the fluorescing sample. The need to accommodate multiple monochromators means that a rather open arrangement around the sample is required, leading to relatively long tube-sample-crystal distances, which leads to lower detected intensities and more scattering. The instrument is inflexible, because if a new element is to be measured, a new measurement channel has to be bought and installed.

*'''&quot;Sequential&quot; spectrometers''' have a single variable-geometry monochromator (but usually with an arrangement for selecting from a choice of crystals), a single detector assembly (but usually with more than one detector arranged in tandem), and a single electronic pack. The instrument is programmed to move through a sequence of wavelengths, in each case selecting the appropriate X-ray tube power, the appropriate crystal, and the appropriate detector arrangement. The length of the measurement program is essentially unlimited, so this arrangement is very flexible. Because there is only one monochromator, the tube-sample-crystal distances can be kept very short, resulting in minimal loss of detected intensity. The obvious disadvantage is relatively long analysis time, particularly when many elements are being analysed, not only because the elements are measured in sequence, but also because a certain amount of time is taken in readjusting the monochromator geometry between measurements. Furthermore, the frenzied activity of the monochromator during an analysis program is a challenge for mechanical reliability. However, modern sequential instruments can achieve reliability almost as good as that of simultaneous instruments, even in continuous-usage applications.

====Sample presentation====
In order to keep the geometry of the tube-sample-detector assembly constant, the sample is normally prepared as a flat disc, typically of diameter 20–50&amp;nbsp;mm. This is located at a standardized, small distance from the tube window. Because the X-ray intensity follows an inverse-square law, the tolerances for this placement and for the flatness of the surface must be very tight in order to maintain a repeatable X-ray flux. Ways of obtaining sample discs vary: metals may be machined to shape, minerals may be finely ground and pressed into a tablet, and glasses may be cast to the required shape. A further reason for obtaining a flat and representative sample surface is that the secondary X-rays from lighter elements often only emit from the top few micrometers of the sample. In order to further reduce the effect of surface irregularities, the sample is usually spun at 5–20 rpm. It is necessary to ensure that the sample is sufficiently thick to absorb the entire primary beam. For higher-Z materials, a few millimetres thickness is adequate, but for a light-element matrix such as coal, a thickness of 30–40&amp;nbsp;mm is needed.

The common feature of monochromators is the maintenance of a symmetrical geometry between the sample, the crystal and the detector. In this geometry the Bragg diffraction condition is obtained.

The X-ray emission lines are very narrow (see figure 2), so the angles must be defined with considerable precision. This is achieved in two ways:

*'''Flat crystal with Soller collimators'''
The Soller collimator is a stack of parallel metal plates, spaced a few tenths of a millimetre apart. To improve angle resolution, one must lengthen the collimator, and/or reduce the plate spacing. This arrangement has the advantage of simplicity and relatively low cost, but the collimators reduce intensity and increase scattering, and reduce the area of sample and crystal that can be &quot;seen&quot;. The simplicity of the geometry is especially useful for variable-geometry monochromators.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
{{-}}
*'''Curved crystal with slits'''
The Rowland circle geometry ensures that the slits are both in focus, but in order for the Bragg condition to be met at all points, the crystal must first be bent to a radius of 2R (where R is the radius of the Rowland circle), then ground to a radius of R. This arrangement allows higher intensities (typically 8-fold) with higher resolution (typically 4-fold) and lower background. However, the mechanics of keeping Rowland circle geometry in a variable-angle monochromator is extremely difficult. In the case of fixed-angle monochromators (for use in simultaneous spectrometers), crystals bent to a logarithmic spiral shape give the best focusing performance. The manufacture of curved crystals to acceptable tolerances increases their price considerably.

====Analysis Lines====
The spectral lines used for chemical analysis are selected on the basis of intensity, accessibility by the instrument, and lack of line overlaps. Typical lines used, and their wavelengths, are as follows:

Other lines are often used, depending on the type of sample and equipment available.

====Crystals====

The desirable characteristics of a diffraction crystal are:
*High diffraction intensity
*High dispersion
*Narrow diffracted peak width
*High peak-to-background
*Absence of interfering elements
*Low thermal coefficient of expansion
*Stability in air and on exposure to X-rays
*Ready availability
*Low cost

Crystals with simple structure tend to give the best diffraction performance. Crystals containing heavy atoms can diffract well, but also fluoresce themselves, causing interference. Crystals that are water-soluble, volatile or organic tend to give poor stability.

Commonly used crystal materials include LiF (lithium fluoride), ADP (ammonium dihydrogen phosphate), Ge (germanium), graphite, InSb (indium antimonide), PE (''tetrakis''-(hydroxymethyl)-methane: penta-erythritol), KAP (potassium hydrogen phthalate), RbAP (rubidium hydrogen phthalate) and TlAP (thallium(I) hydrogen phthalate). In addition, there is an increasing use of &quot;layered synthetic microstructures&quot;, which are &quot;sandwich&quot; structured materials comprising successive thick layers of low atomic number matrix, and monoatomic layers of a heavy element. These can in principle be custom-manufactured to diffract any desired long wavelength, and are used extensively for elements in the range Li to Mg.

====Detectors====
Detectors used for wavelength dispersive spectrometry need to have high pulse processing speeds in order to cope with the very high photon count rates that can be obtained. In addition, they need sufficient energy resolution to allow filtering-out of background noise and spurious photons from the primary beam or from crystal fluorescence. There are four common types of detector:
*gas flow proportional counters
*sealed gas detectors
*scintillation counters
*semiconductor detectors

[[Image:dmwdxrfFlowDetector.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 10: Arrangement of gas flow proportional counter]]
'''Gas flow proportional counters''' are used mainly for detection of longer wavelengths. Gas flows through it continuously. Where there are multiple detectors, the gas is passed through them in series, then led to waste. The gas is usually 90% argon, 10% methane (&quot;P10&quot;), although the argon may be replaced with neon or helium where very long wavelengths (over 5&amp;nbsp;nm) are to be detected. The argon is ionised by incoming X-ray photons, and the electric field multiplies this charge into a measurable pulse. The methane suppresses the formation of fluorescent photons caused by recombination of the argon ions with stray electrons. The anode wire is typically tungsten or nichrome of 20–60 μm diameter. Since the pulse strength obtained is essentially proportional to the ratio of the detector chamber diameter to the wire diameter, a fine wire is needed, but it must also be strong enough to be maintained under tension so that it remains precisely straight and concentric with the detector. The window needs to be conductive, thin enough to transmit the X-rays effectively, but thick and strong enough to minimize diffusion of the detector gas into the high vacuum of the monochromator chamber. Materials often used are beryllium metal, [[Metallized polyethylene terephthalate|aluminised PET film]] and aluminised polypropylene. Ultra-thin windows (down to 1 μm) for use with low-penetration long wavelengths are very expensive. The pulses are sorted electronically by &quot;pulse height selection&quot; in order to isolate those pulses deriving from the secondary X-ray photons being counted.

'''Sealed gas detectors''' are similar to the gas flow proportional counter, except that the gas does not flow though it. The gas is usually krypton or xenon at a few atmospheres pressure. They are applied usually to wavelengths in the 0.15–0.6&amp;nbsp;nm range. They are applicable in principle to longer wavelengths, but are limited by the problem of manufacturing a thin window capable of withstanding the high pressure difference.

'''Scintillation counters''' consist of a scintillating crystal (typically of sodium iodide doped with thallium) attached to a photomultiplier. The crystal produces a group of scintillations for each photon absorbed, the number being proportional to the photon energy. This translates into a pulse from the photomultiplier of voltage proportional to the photon energy. The crystal must be protected with a relatively thick aluminium/beryllium foil window, which limits the use of the detector to wavelengths below 0.25&amp;nbsp;nm. Scintillation counters are often connected in series with a gas flow proportional counter: the latter is provided with an outlet window opposite the inlet, to which the scintillation counter is attached. This arrangement is particularly used in sequential spectrometers.

'''Semiconductor detectors''' can be used in theory, and their applications are increasing as their technology improves, but historically their use for WDX has been restricted by their slow response (see [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|EDX]]).

[[Image:LDHerzogBeadMaking.jpg|thumb|225px|right|A glass &quot;bead&quot; specimen for XRF analysis being cast at around 1100 °C in a Herzog automated fusion machine in a cement plant quality control laboratory. 1 (top): fusing, 2: preheating the mould, 3: pouring the melt, 4: cooling the &quot;bead&quot;]]

====Extracting analytical results====
At first sight, the translation of X-ray photon count-rates into elemental concentrations would appear to be straightforward: WDX separates the X-ray lines efficiently, and the rate of ''generation'' of secondary photons is proportional to the element concentration. However, the number of photons ''leaving the sample'' is also affected by the physical properties of the sample: so-called &quot;[[matrix effects]]&quot;. These fall broadly into three categories:
*X-ray absorption
*X-ray enhancement
*sample macroscopic effects
All elements ''absorb'' X-rays to some extent. Each element has a characteristic absorption spectrum which consists of a &quot;saw-tooth&quot; succession of fringes, each step-change of which has wavelength close to an emission line of the element. Absorption attenuates the secondary X-rays leaving the sample. For example, the mass absorption coefficient of silicon at the wavelength of the aluminium Kα line is 50 m²/kg, whereas that of iron is 377 m²/kg. This means that a given concentration of aluminium in a matrix of iron gives only one seventh of the count rate compared with the same concentration of aluminium in a silicon matrix. Fortunately, mass absorption coefficients are well known and can be calculated. However, to calculate the absorption for a multi-element sample, the composition must be known. For analysis of an unknown sample, an iterative procedure is therefore used. It will be noted that, to derive the mass absorption accurately, data for the concentration of elements not measured by XRF may be needed, and various strategies are employed to estimate these. As an example, in cement analysis, the concentration of oxygen (which is not measured) is calculated by assuming that all other elements are present as standard oxides.

'''Enhancement''' occurs where the secondary X-rays emitted by a heavier element are sufficiently energetic to stimulate additional secondary emission from a lighter element. This phenomenon can also be modelled, and corrections can be made provided that the full matrix composition can be deduced.

'''Sample macroscopic effects''' consist of effects of inhomogeneities of the sample, and unrepresentative conditions at its surface. Samples are ideally homogeneous and isotropic, but they often deviate from this ideal. Mixtures of multiple crystalline components in mineral powders can result in absorption effects that deviate from those calculable from theory. When a powder is pressed into a tablet, the finer minerals concentrate at the surface. Spherical grains tend to migrate to the surface more than do angular grains. In machined metals, the softer components of an alloy tend to smear across the surface. Considerable care and ingenuity are required to minimize these effects. Because they are artefacts of the method of sample preparation, these effects can not be compensated by theoretical corrections, and must be &quot;calibrated in&quot;. This means that the calibration materials and the unknowns must be compositionally and mechanically similar, and a given calibration is applicable only to a limited range of materials. Glasses most closely approach the ideal of homogeneity and isotropy, and for accurate work, minerals are usually prepared by dissolving them in a borate glass, and casting them into a flat disc or &quot;bead&quot;. Prepared in this form, a virtually universal calibration is applicable.

Further corrections that are often employed include background correction and line overlap correction. The background signal in an XRF spectrum derives primarily from scattering of primary beam photons by the sample surface. Scattering varies with the sample mass absorption, being greatest when mean atomic number is low. When measuring trace amounts of an element, or when measuring on a variable light matrix, background correction becomes necessary. This is really only feasible on a sequential spectrometer. Line overlap is a common problem, bearing in mind that the spectrum of a complex mineral can contain several hundred measurable lines. Sometimes it can be overcome by measuring a less-intense, but overlap-free line, but in certain instances a correction is inevitable. For instance, the Kα is the only usable line for measuring sodium, and it overlaps the zinc Lβ (L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-M&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) line. Thus zinc, if present, must be analysed in order to properly correct the sodium value.

==Other spectroscopic methods using the same principle==
It is also possible to create a characteristic secondary X-ray emission using other incident radiation to excite the sample:
*[[electron]] beam: [[electron microprobe]] (or [[:fr:Raimond Castaing|Castaing]] microprobe);
*[[ion]] beam: [[PIXE|particle induced X-ray emission]] (PIXE).
When radiated by an X-ray beam, the sample also emits other radiations that can be used for analysis:
*[[electron]]s ejected by the [[photoelectric effect]]: [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS), also called [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy|electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis]] (ESCA)
The de-excitation also ejects [[Auger electron]]s, but [[Auger electron spectroscopy]] (AES) normally uses an electron beam as the probe.

[[Confocal|Confocal microscopy]] X-ray fluorescence imaging is a newer technique that allow control over depth, in addition to horizontal and vertical aiming, for example, when analyzing buried layers in a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=326128&amp;jid=MAM&amp;volumeId=11&amp;issueId=S02&amp;aid=326127|journal=Microscopy and Microanalysis|year=2005|volume=11|page=682|doi=10.1017/S1431927605503167|title=Confocal X-ray Fluorescence Imaging and XRF Tomography for Three-Dimensional Trace Element Microanalysis|author=L.

== Bounds on constraints ==
The GLPK presolver (as of version 4.45) cannot eliminate or combine duplicate rows.{{ref|1|1}}
Therefore, in order to reduce the row count and hence the solution time, [[w:Linear_dependence|linearly dependent]] constraint equations should be manually combined.
For example:
&lt;pre&gt;
s.t. c1 : x + 2 * y &lt;= 4;
s.t. c2 : 2 * x + 4 * y &gt;= 3;
&lt;/pre&gt;
can be replaced by:
&lt;pre&gt;
s.t. c3 : 1.5 &lt;= x + 2 * y &lt;= 4;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Bounds on variables ==
Placing lower and/or upper bounds on optimization variables can either be set on definition or achieved through dedicated constraints.  Be aware that variables in MathProg are ''unbounded'' unless subsequently qualified or restricted (unlike their API counterparts, which are zeroed by default).

=== Dedicated constraints ===
Bounds on variables can be readily implemented using dedicated constraints.

Take, for instance, a &lt;tt&gt;ramp&lt;/tt&gt; variable, symmetrically restricted by the &lt;tt&gt;max_ramp_rate&lt;/tt&gt; parameter:
&lt;pre&gt;
param max_ramp_rate;
var ramp {I};
s.t. upper_feasible_ramp_rate {i in I}: ramp[i] &lt;=  max_ramp_rate;
s.t. lower_feasible_ramp_rate {i in I}: ramp[i] &gt;= &amp;minus;max_ramp_rate;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The presolver will automatically eliminate constraints containing ''one'' variable only and use that information instead to tighten the bounds on that variable &amp;mdash; on solution however, the process is reversed and the primary and dual values for the original constraint are duly determined.  Alternatively, if the presolver is ''not'' deployed, it is advisable to at least reduce double constraints to a single constraint in order to lessen the model size.  The above example can thus be recast:
&lt;pre&gt;
param max_ramp_rate;
var ramp {I};
s.t. feasible_ramp_rate {i in I}: &amp;minus;max_ramp_rate &lt;= ramp[i] &lt;= max_ramp_rate;
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Variable bounds ===
Bounds on variables may also be set when defining the variable in question.  This is usually the preferred way to model such restrictions.

The previous ramp rate example can thus be achieved:
&lt;pre&gt;
param max_ramp_rate;
var ramp {I}, &gt;= &amp;minus;max_ramp_rate, &lt;= max_ramp_rate;
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Comparison ===

The performance difference between the two methods is negligible for small models, but may be significant for larger models. 
The following table summaries the relative advantages of each method:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
! Dedicated constraints !! Variable bounds
|-
|
* possibly simpler to conceptualize&amp;nbsp;
* dual value available for analysis
|
* speed up due to reduced number of constraint equations&amp;nbsp;
* less memory consumption
|}

== Notes ==

:1.{{note|1}} There is a proposal to add this feature to the GLPK presolver [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-glpk/2010-11/msg00013.html].

[[File:Information.svg|25px|link=]]  We welcome and appreciate [[Special:Contributions/123.238.28.199|your contributions]], including your edits to [[:Sufism]], but some of your recent actions differ from the way things are normally done at Wikibooks.  [[Using Wikibooks]] can be helpful in learning more about conventions. I noticed that you recently added commentary to a page. While Wikibooks welcomes editors' opinions on a page and how it could be changed, these comments are more appropriate for the book's accompanying talk pages. If you post your comments there, other editors working on the same book will notice and respond to them and your comments will not disrupt the flow of the content. However, keep in mind that even on talk pages of a book, you should limit your discussion to improving the content. Book talk pages are not the place to discuss opinions of the subject matter, nor are such pages a forum.

Earthquakes are rivaled only by hurricanes in their ability to cause enormous amounts of damage. Earthquake damage comes not only from ground shaking, but also from the fires, landslides, and tsunamis that may result from the shaking. There are ways for communities to prepare for earthquakes by using earthquake-safe construction techniques or retrofitting old structures. Individuals and households can take actions such as securing heavy objects and preparing an emergency kit. Still, despite the best precautions, a massive earthquake can cause enormous numbers of fatalities and damage.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Describe different types of earthquake damage.
* Describe the features that make a structure more earthquake safe.
* Describe the ways that a person and a household can protect themselves in earthquake country.

==Damage from Earthquakes==
Earthquakes kill people and damage property. There are a lot of falsehoods about how earthquakes do their damage and what sort of damage they do or can be expected to do. The ground shaking almost never kills or injures people; rarely, if ever, does the ground open up and swallow someone. Fatalities and injuries caused by earthquakes are due to structures falling on people. More damage is done and more people are killed by the fires that usually follow an earthquake than by the earthquake itself.

Damage to people and property depends on an earthquake's magnitude, the distance of the epicenter to population centers, and how long the ground shakes. But human factors are important too. The type of ground structures are built on is an enormous factor in the amount of damage done. Damage also depends on the quality of structures, including what materials are used.

The largest earthquakes are not necessarily the deadliest. Only about 2,000 people died in the 1960 Great Chilean earthquake, which was the largest earthquake ever recorded at magnitude 9.5. The 1556 Shaanxi earthquake in China measured a magnitude 8.0, but is estimated to have killed about 830,000 people. The Great Sumatra - Andaman earthquake of 2004 makes the list of the largest earthquakes and was also one of the deadliest. However, most of the 230,000 fatalities were due to the tsunami that followed the earthquake, not the earthquake itself.

Damage during an earthquake depends on the type of ground under the buildings. Solid bedrock vibrates much less than soft sediments. Buildings on bedrock will only fail if the earthquake is extremely violent. Soft ground, such as sand, silt, or clay, settles when it is shaken and so buildings tilt or fall over, and pipelines, roadways, and other structures break. Sediments that are saturated with water undergo '''liquefaction''' during an earthquake and become like quicksand. Soil on a hillside that is shaken loose can become a landslide, which takes houses downhill with it or buries structures at the hill's base.

In earthquake-prone areas, city planners spend a lot of time understanding which locations are the most vulnerable and trying to reduce the hazards. For example, in the San Francisco Bay Area, planners study maps that show how much shaking is expected in various areas for different magnitudes and locations of earthquakes (Figure 7.44). Using this information can allow them to understand and prepare for the hazards. For example, when faced with two possible locations for a new hospital, planners must build on bedrock rather than silt and clay.

[[File:RogersCrkNorthHayward.gif|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 7.44''': This map shows the amount of shaking on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale that would be expected for an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 on the northern portion of the Hayward Fault. Much of the land near the bay, where shaking is predicted to be most violent is loose mud &amp; soil, called fill. The hills around the bay, which are mostly colored green, are bedrock. The outline of the Hayward Fault can be seen in black, since it is where the most violent shaking is predicted to be.]]

Mexico City provides an example of how soft ground can magnify earthquake damage. In 1985, a magnitude 8.1 earthquake struck about 350 kilometers west of the city. The earthquake was caused by subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate. Mexican government records show that the earthquake killed at least 9,000 people, injured 30,000 more, left 100,000 people homeless, destroyed 416 buildings, and seriously damaged 3,000 other buildings. The reason for so much destruction so far from the earthquake’s epicenter is that Mexico City is built on a drained lake bed. Beneath the capital city, the ground is soft silt and clay in a basin made of solid rock. When the earthquake struck, seismic waves bounced back-and-forth off the sides and bottom of the rock basin amplifying the shaking. In addition, the wet clay experienced liquefaction (Figure 7.45). The buildings were not anchored to bedrock as they should have been and so they settled into the muck, causing enormous damage.

[[File:MexCity85quake.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 7.45''': Liquefaction of sediments in Mexico City caused the collapse of many buildings in the 1985 earthquake.]]

Water, sewer and electrical systems were destroyed, resulting in fires. Acapulco, which was much closer to the epicenter but built on bedrock suffered little damage. To prevent Mexico City from being taken by surprise again, the government built an alert system. The next time there is an earthquake in the subduction zone, a signal will be activated and sirens will sound in the city. This will give residents about one minute to prepare for the inevitable earthquake. At the least, this is enough time for most people to get in a secure location.

The population density of a region is also important to the number of casualties and the amount of damage. The 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake, near Anchorage, was the largest earthquake ever recorded in North America and the second largest globally, with a magnitude of 9.2. The earthquake lasted for several minutes, resulted in slip of up to 11.5 meters (38 feet), and affected an area of 100,000 square miles (250,000 square km). Ground liquefaction caused landslides (Figure 7.46).

[[File:AlaskaQuake-Turnagain.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 7.46''': A landslide in a neighborhood in Anchorage Alaska after the 1964 Great Alaska earthquake.]]

Because the earthquake occurred at a subduction zone offshore, large tsunami (up to 70 meters (20 feet)) were created. Despite the intensity of the earthquake, only 131 people died, mostly due to the tsunami and property damage was relatively modest, at just over $300 million ($1.8 billion in 2007 U.S. dollars). The reason there was such a small amount of damage for such a large earthquake is that very few people lived in the area at that time (Alaska had only been a state for five years!). A similar earthquake today would cause immeasurably more casualties. The number of people that an earthquake kills or injures is often related to the time of day that it strikes and where it strikes. The most lethal earthquakes strike densely populated cities when people are at work and school. Being at home in bed is usually safer.

==Earthquake-Safe Structures==
The way a building is built&amp;mdash;its construction&amp;mdash;is a large factor in what happens during an earthquake. Building construction is the reason many more people died in the 1988 Armenia earthquake than the 1989 Loma Prieta, California earthquake. Although the Armenian earthquake was only slightly lower in magnitude, the mud houses that are found throughout the area collapsed. Most buildings in California's earthquake country are designed to be earthquake safe. However even earthquake safe buildings can be damaged by a large earthquake.

Engineers who design earthquake safe buildings must understand seismic waves and how they affect different types of ground. Skyscrapers and other large structures built on soft ground must be anchored to bedrock, even if it is lies hundreds of meters below the ground surface.

The materials used to construct a structure affect its ability to weather an earthquake. The type of material that is best depends on the size of the building. Small structures, like houses, do better if they are constructed of materials that bend and sway such as wood and steel rather than brick, stone, and adobe, which are brittle and will break. Brittle materials are less likely to break if they are reinforced by steel or wood. Larger buildings must sway, but not so much that they touch nearby buildings. Counterweights and diagonal steel beams are used to hold down sway. A completely different approach for large buildings is to place them on rollers so that they move with the ground but do not collapse. Buildings may also be placed on layers of steel and rubber, which absorb the shock of the passing seismic waves. Structures that fail usually do so because they are weak at the connections, such as where the walls meet the foundation. Earthquake safe buildings are well connected. In a multi-story building, the first story must be supported or the structure may collapse (Figure 7.47).

[[File:LomaPrieta-Marina.jpeg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 7.47''': The first floor of this San Francisco building is collapsing after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The building is being held up by the two walls that are not in the photograph and the strength of the upper floors. The two walls that are in view are not strong because they had doors in them.]]

Older structures can be retrofitted to be more earthquake safe. Retrofitting includes adding steel or wood to reinforce a buildings structure and its connections (Figure 7.48). Elevated freeways and bridges can also be retrofitted so that they do not collapse. The goal of retrofitting is different depending on the type of structure being altered. Most structures are retrofit only to a strength that protects human life. More important structures, like bridges, are made to survive intact, but may need extensive repair after the earthquake. Structures that need to be used in an emergency, like hospitals, are retrofit to higher standards so that they will need only superficial repairs after an earthquake. The highest level of protection is a retrofit that will allow a building to survive unaffected. This is very expensive and is only done for buildings that are of great historical or cultural significance.

[[File:ExteiorShearTruss.jpg|center|frame|'''Figure 7.48''': Steel trusses were built in an x-pattern to retrofit a dormitory at the University of California, Berkeley. The building is very near the Hayward Fault.]]

Of course, one of the biggest problems stemming from earthquakes is fire. Fires start because earthquakes rupture gas and electrical lines. Breaks in water mains compound the problem by making it difficult to fight those fires. One effective way of dealing with this is to zigzag pipes so that they bend and flex when the ground shakes. Straight pipes will break in a quake. In San Francisco, water and gas pipelines are separated by valves so that areas can be isolated if one segment breaks.

Since engineers know what sorts of structures do best in earthquakes, why aren't all structures in earthquakes zones constructed for maximum safety? Of course, the reason is cost. More sturdy structures are much more expensive to build. Since no one knows which structures will be exposed to a large earthquake during their effective lifetimes, communities must decide how safe to make their buildings. They must weigh how great the hazard is, what different building strategies will cost, and how much risk they are willing to take. In poor communities, the choice may come down to spending money on earthquake-safe buildings or funding other priorities, such as a water sanitation project. The choice often comes down to protecting against a known risk versus unknown one; for example, many people in developing nations die each year from drinking and bathing in unclean water.

==Protecting Yourself in an Earthquake==
If you live in an earthquake zone, there are many things you can do to protect yourself before, during, and after an earthquake. The two goals are to make sure that the house and its contents are not a hazard and for the household to be ready to live independently for a few days until emergency services are available in full force.

Before the Earthquake:
* Have an engineer evaluate your house for structural integrity. Make sure the separate pieces&amp;mdash;floor, walls, roof and foundation&amp;mdash;are all well attached to each other.
* Bracket or brace brick chimneys to the roof.
* Be sure that heavy objects are not stored in high places. Move them to low places so that they do not fall.
* Secure water heaters all around and at the top and bottom.
* Bolt heavy furniture onto walls with bolts, screws, or strap hinges.
* Replace halogen and incandescent light bulbs with fluorescent bulbs to lessen fire risk.
* Check to see that gas lines are made of flexible material so that they do not rupture. Any equipment that uses gas should be well secured.
* Everyone in the household should know how to shut off the gas line. A wrench should be placed nearby for doing so.
* Prepare an earthquake kit with at least three days supply of water and food. Include a radio and batteries.
* Place flashlights all over the house so that there is always one available. Place one in the glove box of your car.
* Keep several fire extinguishers around the house to fight the small fires that might break out.
* Be sure to have a first aid kit. Everyone in the household who is capable should know basic first aid and CPR.
* Plan in advance how you will evacuate your property and where you will go. Do not plan on driving as roadways will likely be damaged.

During the Earthquake:
* If you are in a building, drop to the ground, get beneath a sturdy table or desk, cover your head, and hold on.
* Stay away from windows and mirrors since glass can break and fall on you. Stay away from large furniture that may fall on you.
* If the building is structurally unsound, get outside as fast as possible. Run into an open area away from buildings and power lines that may fall on you.
* If you are in a car, stay in the car and stay away from structures that might collapse like overpasses, bridges, or buildings.

After the Earthquake:
* Be aware that aftershocks are likely.
* Avoid dangerous areas like hillsides that may experience a landslide.
* Turn off water and power to your home.
* Use your phone only if there is an emergency. Many people with urgent needs will be trying to get through to emergency services.
* Be prepared to wait for help or instructions. Assist others as necessary.

==Lesson Summary==
* A person standing in an open field in an earthquake will almost certainly be safe. Nearly all earthquake danger is from buildings falling, roadways collapsing, or from the fires and tsunamis that come after the shaking stops.
* Communities can prepare for earthquakes by requiring that buildings be earthquake safe and by educating citizens on how to prepare for an earthquake.
* Individuals and households can prepare in two ways: by making sure that their house and its contents are not a hazard and by being ready to live independently for a few days while emergency services regroup and get to all parts of the region.

==Review Questions==
# What usually kills or injures people in an earthquake?
# In two earthquakes of the same size, what reasons are there that more people would be killed in a location further from the epicenter than in one nearer the epicenter?
# Describe why Mexico City was so devastated by the far away 8.1 earthquake that struck in 1985. Why did Acapulco, which is located much closer to the quake site, fare so much better?
# What is liquefaction and how does it cause damage in an earthquake?
# Pretend that you live in an old home in an earthquake-prone region. No work has ever been done to prepare your home for an earthquake. What should you do to minimize the harm that will come to yourself and your home?
# What can an architect do to make a skyscraper earthquake safe?
# Which types of buildings deserve the greatest protection from earthquake hazards?
# Using what you know about elastic strength, will a building better withstand an earthquake if it is built absolutely solid or if it is able to sway? Why?
# Why do wealthy communities (such as those in California) tend to have greater earthquake protection than poorer communities (such as those in developing nations)?
# What are the two goals of earthquake preparation?
# What should you include in an earthquake kit?
# Under what circumstances should you run outside in an earthquake?

==Vocabulary==
; liquefaction
: Clay, silt, and sand saturated with water become like quicksand, lose their strength and behave more like a liquid than a solid. Solids turn to a type of paste, solids thus become weak and unstable not providing proper support.

==Points to Consider==
* Many people think that in a large earthquake California will fall into the ocean and that Arizona and Nevada will be beach front property. Why is this not true?
* If you were the mayor of a small city in an earthquake-prone area, what would you like to know before choosing the building site of a new hospital?
* How are decisions made for determining how much money to spend preparing people and structures for earthquakes?

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;:''[[World Stamp Catalogue|&amp;#60; World Stamp Catalogue]]'' (go up)&lt;/noinclude&gt;

&lt;noinclude&gt;This is the new template for listing stamps. &lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;includeonly&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot; style=&quot;border=&quot;1&quot;; width=95%; valign=top;&quot;
|-
! width=10% | [[wikipedia:First day of issue|Date Issued]]
! width=6%  | &lt;small&gt;Denom.&lt;/small&gt;
! width=6%  | &lt;small&gt;Paper.&lt;/small&gt;
! width=8% | [[World_Stamp_Catalogue/Description_conventions#Colour|Color]]

&lt;/includeonly&gt;

&lt;noinclude&gt;
=== How to include it ===
Start a list by inserting the following line, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{World Stamp Catalogue/List}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

After including the line above, simple start adding a stamp listing using &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to start a line, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to separate the fields, and &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|-&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to draw a line between listings. For example, 

{| class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot; style=&quot;border=&quot;1&quot;; width=100%; valign=top;&quot;

===How to use with Template:World Stamp Catalogue/Stamp===

Alternatively, the Stamp template can be used to insert each stamp. This is helpful to keep track of the order of each field. 

&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{World Stamp Catalogue/List}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

{{World Stamp Catalogue/Stamp |FDOI=May 13, 1918 |DENOM=24¢| PAPER= |COLOR=Rose &amp; Blue |PERFORATION=11 |TYPE= |SUBJECT=Curtis Jenny Biplane |CAT_NO=C3 |IMAGE=US stamp 1918 24c Curtiss Jenny -C3.jpg |NUM_ISSUED=3,095,955 |DESIGNER= |NOTES= }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

{{World Stamp Catalogue/Stamp |FDOI=May 13, 1918 |DENOM=24¢| PAPER=  |COLOR=Rose &amp; Blue |PERFORATION=11 |TYPE=invert |SUBJECT=Curtis Jenny Biplane |CAT_NO=C3a |IMAGE=Inverted Jenny.jpg |NUM_ISSUED=100 |DESIGNER= |NOTES= }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

|}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Again, don't forget the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; at the end of all listings within the list.

IMPORTANT: Any changes made to this template must also be reflected in the [[Template:World Stamp Catalogue/Stamp|Stamp Template]].

Everybody has heard of volcanoes&amp;mdash;the angry Earth spewing up its wrath, the sudden explosion of a distant mountain top, and lava that slithers ominously toward villages. Volcanoes are fantastic displays of the power of the Earth. But what actually is a volcano? How and where are they formed? Why do some places have a history of volcanic activity? Volcanoes explain a key piece of the Earth's geologic puzzle (Figure 8.1).

[[File:Blethrow merapi1.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.1''': Mount Merapi, Indonesia.]]

==Lesson Objectives==
* Explain how volcanoes form.
* Describe places where volcanoes occur.
* Describe what volcanic hot spots are and where they occur.

==How Volcanoes Form==
[[File:Volcano scheme.svg|250px|right|thumb|'''Figure 8.2''': A volcano is a vent through which molten rock and gas from beneath the Earth's surface escape. (1) Large magma chamber (2) Bedrock (3) Pipe (conduit) (4) Layers of ash (5) Layers of lava (6) Lava flow (7) Vent (8) Lava (9) Ash cloud]]

You have already learned about tectonic plates. Beneath the Earth's surface, powerful forces are at work. These forces move lithospheric plates and produce huge chambers of '''magma''', molten rock beneath the Earth's crust. Like water that bursts from a tiny hole in a water pipe, the liquid magma seeks cracks or '''fissures''' in the Earth's crust through which it could flow. This is a volcano&amp;mdash;an opening in the earth’s crust through which magma or gases can erupt onto the surface.

When molten rock escapes from beneath the Earth's surface, it changes from magma to '''lava''', molten rock above the Earth's surface. Because the temperatures at the Earth's surface are much lower than in the magma chambers, the lava does not take long to solidify back into rock. As layer upon layer of lava solidifies, a mountain is formed (Figure 8.2).

As you can see in Figure 8.2, magma begins in the lava chamber and comes to the surface through the throat of the volcano. The volcano is constructed layer by layer, as ash and lava solidify, one upon the other. However, other types of volcanoes exist, and will be discussed later in this chapter.
{{clear}}
==Where Volcanoes Occur==
Because volcanoes are vents for magma, it makes sense that volcanoes would be formed above underground magma chambers. If you recall, magma is molten rock that has been heated because of high temperatures and pressures beneath the Earth's crust. This pressure mostly occurs where the tectonic plates meet and subduct. Look at the map of tectonic plates in Figure 8.3.

[[File:World tectonic plate map large.png|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.3''': Tectonic plates. Some of the largest tectonic plates meet along the coasts of Asia and North America. Compare this map to the map in Figure 8.4.]]

So, volcanic activity tends to occur along subduction plate boundaries, where one plate slides underneath another. The edges of the Pacific Plate make up a long subduction boundary. There are a huge number of earthquakes along these boundaries, because these are regions where the plates are colliding. For the same reason, the majority of the volcanic activity on the Earth also occurs along these convergent boundaries. This is called the ''Pacific Ring of Fire'' where over 75% of the world's volcanoes are found. The Cascade Range of volcanoes runs through southwestern Canada and the Pacific Northwest of the United States. These volcanoes are the result of subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath the North American plate. (Figure 8.4).

[[File:Pacific Ring of Fire.svg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.4''': The Pacific Ring of Fire is where the majority of the volcanic activity on the Earth occurs.]]
[[File:Mid-atlantic ridge map.png|right|frame|'''Figure 8.5''': The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is formed by divergent tectonic plates.]]

Of course, this is not the only area where volcanoes occur. Beneath the ocean, there are also divergent boundaries, where tectonic plates are pulling away from each other. As the plates pull away from each other, they create a deep canyon or fissure on the sea floor through which molten rock escapes. Mid-ocean ridges, like the Mid-Atlantic ridge, form here as lava flows out through the fissure (Figure 8.5). Submarine volcanoes can also form on the ocean floor. At times these volcanoes can grow to create islands above the water's surface. This explains how Surtsey, a small island near Iceland formed (Figure 8.6).

[[File:Eruption2010eyja.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.6''': A volcanic eruption in Iceland.]]

==Volcanic Hot Spots==
Although most volcanic activity on Earth occurs at plate boundaries, there are some volcanically active spots that are in the middle of a tectonic plate. These areas are called '''hot spots'''. The islands of Hawaii formed over a hot spot and are not located on the Pacific Ring of Fire (Figure 8.7). The Hawaiian islands are the exposed peaks of a great chain of volcanoes that were formed over millions of years. The islands are thought to lie directly above a column of hot rock called a '''mantle plume'''. Mantle plumes are more or less fixed in place and continuously bring magma up from the mantle towards the crust. As the tectonic plates move above them, they leave a trail of volcanic activity, which forms island chains like Hawaii. Scientists believe there are about 50 hot spots on the Earth. Other hot spots include Yellowstone and the Galapagos Islands.

[[File:2003-3d-hawaiian-islands-usgs-i2809.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.7''': Hawaii is a volcanic hot spot.  It was formed by volcanic activity fed by mantle plumes.]]

Don't confuse hot spot volcanoes with islands that are formed by plate tectonics like the Aleutian island chain in Alaska. These long lines of volcanoes form as the edge of a subducted plate melts, producing magma which rises to the surface along the edge of the plate. These volcanic mountains will all be about the same age. When islands form over a hot spot, the youngest island is over the hot spot. As you move along the island chain, each island further from the hot spot will be older than the one before it.

==Lesson Summary==
* Volcanoes form when magma reaches the Earth's surface.
* Volcanoes occur most often along plate boundaries.
* Convergent plate boundaries where oceanic crust is subducted form many of the volcanoes found on Earth.
* Divergent plate boundaries produce huge mountain ranges under water in every ocean basin.
* Volcanoes like those that form the islands of Hawaii, form over areas called hot spots.

==Review Questions==
# What is the difference between magma and lava?
# Explain how volcanoes are formed.
# Why are there volcanoes along the west coast of the United States?
# Why do volcanoes occur where tectonic plates pull apart or diverge?
# Explain how the Pacific Ring of Fire got its name.
# What is a mantle plume?
# Suppose a new volcano suddenly formed in the middle of the United States. How might you explain what caused this volcano?
# Volcanoes have been found on Venus, Mars, and even Jupiter's moon Io. What do you think this indicates to planetary geologists?

==Vocabulary==
; fissure
: A long crack into the Earth's surface, from which lava erupts onto the surface.
; hot spot
: A fixed region of hot magma that rises through the mantle and creates volcanoes on the Earth's surface. A hot spot is above a mantle plume.
; lava
: Molten rock that has been erupted onto the Earth's surface. Magma becomes lava once it emerges on the surface.
; magma
: Molten rock found under the Earth's surface.
; mantle plume
: A column of very hot rock that rises up through the mantle. Mantle plumes will form hot spots if they make it all the way up to the surface of the Earth's crust.

==Points to Consider==
* When you look at the map of tectonic plates (Figure 8.3), what areas besides the Pacific Ring of Fire would you expect to have volcanic activity?
* Some volcanoes are extinct; they are no longer active and will probably never be again. What do you think causes a volcano to become extinct?
* Hot spots are still poorly understood by earth scientists. Given your understanding of the Earth's interior, why do you think it's hard to study hot spots?

In 1980, Mount St. Helens erupted in one of the most deadly and costly volcanic eruptions in the United States ever. The eruption was particularly deadly since Mount St. Helens, one of the Cascade Range, is in a populated area between Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington. The eruption killed 57 people, destroyed 250 homes, and swept away 47 bridges. The elevation of the volcano dropped by over 400 meters (1,300 feet) because of the immense explosion created by the eruption. Today Mt. St. Helens is still active (Figure 8.8). The volcano now has a horseshoe-shaped crater that is 1.5 km (nearly one mile) across. Within the crater, a new lava dome has formed. How did this eruption occur? Why aren't all volcanoes explosive like Mt. St. Helens? Why did so many people perish if we knew that it was going to erupt? The study of volcanoes has many questions still unanswered. However, scientists have studied volcanoes for many years and are piecing together evidence that explains these powerful geologic phenomena.

[[File:MSH82 st helens plume from harrys ridge 05-19-82.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.8''': Mount St. Helens, Washington, two years after its eruption.]]

==Lesson Objectives==
* Explain how volcanoes erupt.
* Describe and compare the types of volcanic eruptions.
* Distinguish between different types of lava and understand the difference between magma and lava.
* Describe a method for predicting volcanic eruptions.

==How Volcanoes Erupt==
All volcanoes share the same basic features. The magma collects in magma chambers that can be 160 kilometers (100 miles) beneath the surface. As the rock heats, it expands, which creates even more pressure. As a result, the magma seeks a way out pushing toward the surface, and seeps through cracks in the Earth's crust called vents. Eventually, it reaches the surface; when it comes out, we call it an eruption. The word '''eruption''' is used in other contexts, as well. An eruption can be an outburst or explosion, a violent and sudden occurrence, like when a crowd erupts in anger. But an eruption can also be a spreading of something like a rash on your skin, gradual and relatively calm. These two definitions are similar to the two kinds of eruptions that we see in volcanoes.

==Types of Eruptions==
Every geological formation is unique. Their composition and construction depend on so many factors, that it would be impossible for two formations to be exactly alike. In the same way, each volcano and its eruptions are unique. However, we tend to see two major kinds of eruptions. We talked about eruption to mean both a violent explosion or a sort of silent spreading. These are the two types of volcanic eruptions that we see–explosive and non-explosive eruptions. When we think of volcanic eruptions, we often think of huge clouds of volcanic ash ejected high into the atmosphere and then thick rivers of red lava snaking down the mountainside. In reality, these two phenomena rarely occur in the same volcano. Volcanic eruptions tend to be one or the other.

===Explosive Eruptions===
Imagine the devastation and force caused by the atom bomb dropped on Nagasaki at the end of World War II in which over 40,000 people died. Now imagine an explosion 10,000 times as powerful. Explosive volcanic eruptions can be that powerful (Figure 8.9). As hot magma beneath the surface interacts with water, gases accumulate and the magma pressure builds up. This pressure grows and grows until these dissolved gases cause it to burst in an enormous explosion.

[[File:Pyroclastic flows at Mayon Volcano.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.9''': An explosive eruption from the Mayon Volcano in the Philippines in 1984.]]

This great explosion takes with it the magma and volcanic gases, which can shoot many kilometers into the sky and forms a mushroom cloud, similar to that formed by a nuclear explosion (Figure 8.10). The debris travels up into the air at very high speeds and cools in the atmosphere to form solid particles called '''pyroclasts'''. Some of these particles can stay in the atmosphere for years, which can disrupt weather patterns and affect the temperature of the Earth. The rest of the debris comes falling back to Earth where it rains down for kilometers and kilometers around.

[[File:MtRedoubtedit1.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.10''': Explosive eruption of Mt. Redoubt in Alaska, 1989. This huge mushroom cloud reached 45,000 feet and caught a Boeing 747 in its plume.]]

Sometimes secondary explosions occur that are even greater than the first. Additionally, volcanic gases like water vapor, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrogen chloride can form poisonous and invisible clouds that roam about the atmosphere. These gases contribute to environmental problems like acid rain and ozone destruction, and can actually cool the Earth's atmosphere.

In the Cascade Range, the explosive eruption of Mount St. Helens was preceded by the eruption of Lassen Peak, one of the three Cascade Volcanoes in northern California. On May 22, 1915, an explosive eruption sent a column of ash and gas 30,000 feet into the air and triggered a high-speed pyroclastic flow, which melted snow and created a lahar. Lassen continues to have geothermal activity and could erupt explosively again. Mt. Shasta erupts every 600 to 800 years. An eruption would most likely to create a large pyroclastic flow, and perhaps a lahar. However, the volcano could explode like Mt. Mazama, which blew itself in an eruption about 42 times more powerful than Mount St. Helens in 1980, to create Crater Lake.

===Non-explosive Eruptions===
A second type of volcanic eruption is a non-explosive or '''effusive eruption''' (Figure 8.11). Because the composition of magma is different in different volcanoes, the properties of the lava are different. In effusive eruptions, lava flows are relatively calm and do not explode out of the volcano. As a result, people generally have a great deal of warning before lava reaches them, so non-explosive eruptions are much less deadly. That does not keep them from being destructive, however. Even when we know that a lava flow is approaching, there are few ways of stopping it, given the huge quantity and temperature of lava.

[[File:Lava from Kilauea.jpg|500px|center|'''Figure 8.11''': In effusive eruptions, lava flows more readily, producing rivers of molten rock.]]

==Magma and Lava==
Volcanoes wouldn't be nearly as interesting without the great explosions they create and the glowing red rivers of lava. All igneous rock comes from magma or lava. The next time you go hiking near a volcanic zone, you might try to identify the types of lava that the volcano erupted, based on the types of igneous rocks you find.

[[File:Pahoeoe fountain edit2.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.12''': When lava flows readily, pressure does not build up so great explosions do not occur.]]

===Magma===
Deep beneath the Earth, magma forms as the first stage in creating a volcano. This occurs because rock below the surface is subjected to great amounts of pressure from gravity. The decay of radioactive materials generates additional heat. The substantial heat and pressure melt the rock below the surface to form a taffy-like substance. You may have seen a candle that has been left out in the hot sun too long. It becomes softer and more like a liquid. As the molecules absorb heat, they begin to slide past one another becoming more fluid. A similar process occurs with magma. However, different substances melt at different temperatures. For that reason, the temperature at which rocks melt depends on the specific types of rocks. The Earth's crust and mantle are made of many substances so the temperature required to create magma varies. Most magmas are formed between 600&amp;deg;C and 1300&amp;deg;C (Figure 8.13).

[[File:Earth-crust-cutaway-english.svg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.13''': Cutaway of the Earth. The melting of rock in the crust and upper mantle create magma.]]

Melted rock or magma can be found in '''magma chambers''' beneath the Earth. Since the magma chambers are so far beneath the Earth's surface, it is difficult for scientists to study them. Scientists know that magma chambers are created where the heat and pressure are greatest. When tectonic plates collide and rub against each other, magma is formed there. That is how the Pacific Ring of Fire was created. We also know there are volcanoes far away from plate boundaries, so we know there are magma chambers in these areas as well. Magma chambers can be found where there are mantle plumes or hot spots.

Just how or why these hot spots are created isn't exactly known. However, because different substances melt at different temperatures, the creation of magma depends on what substances make it up&amp;mdash;its composition. Just like the flavor of a cake depends on the ingredients that you put in it, the behavior of magma and lava depends on its composition. Certain melted rocks act in certain ways. So when the magma becomes lava, not all lava acts the same.

===Lava===
[[File:Filtering_of_honey.jpg|250px|thumb|'''Figure 8.14''': Honey flows slowly; it is more viscous than water.]]

Once magma reaches the surface, it becomes lava. Consider different liquids that you might see in your house&amp;mdash;honey and a bottle of cola, for example. You might agree that the two liquids are different in many regards. They taste different, have different colors, have different gases in them, and they flow differently. In fact, honey is a liquid that resists flowing, whereas cola flows easily. Honey has a higher '''viscosity''' than the cola; it resists flowing (Figure 8.14). Cola has a low viscosity because it flows easily. One of the major differences in different types of lava is their viscosity.

A highly viscous lava is one that doesn't tend to flow easily. It tends to stay in place. Lavas with high silica contents tend to be more viscous. Since it is so resistant to moving, it clogs the vents in a volcano. The pressure becomes greater and greater until the volcano finally explodes. This type of lava is found in explosive eruptions. It also tends to trap a lot of gas. When the gas is released, it makes the eruption more explosive. Most of this lava is shot up into the air where it hardens and becomes solid rock. This molten rock that solidifies in the air is known as '''pyroclastic material'''. In an igneous rock like pumice, small holes in the solid rock show where gas bubbles were when the rock was still liquid lava.

Low-viscosity lava slides or flows down mountainsides. There is more than one type of low-viscosity lava. The differences between them come from the lavas' different composition and different spots where they come to the surface. The type of igneous formations formed depends on which type of lava it is. The three major categories are a'a, pahoehoe, and pillow lava.

====A'a Lava====
A'a lava is the more viscous of the non-explosive lavas (Figure 8.15). This lava forms a thick and brittle crust which is torn into rough and jagged pieces. The solidified surface is jagged and sharp. It can spread over large areas as the lava continues to flow underneath.

[[File:Aa large.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.15''': A'a lava flow.]]
{{clear}}
====Pāhoehoe Lava====
Pāhoehoe lava is less viscous than a'a lava, and flows more readily. Its surface looks more wrinkly and smooth than the jagged a'a lava. Pāhoehoe lava flows in a series of lobes or rounded areas that form strange twisted shapes and natural rock sculptures (Figure 8.16). Pāhoehoe lava can also form lava tubes beneath the ground (Figure 8.17).

[[File:Hawaii slowly moving lava.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.16''': Pāhoehoe lava.]]

[[File:Thurston Lava Tube.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.17''': The Thurston Lava Tube in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.]]

====Pillow Lava====
Pillow lava is lava that comes out from volcanic vents underwater (Figure 8.18). When it comes out underwater, it cools down very quickly and forms roughly spherical rocks that resemble pillows, from which more lava leaks and creates more pillows. Pillow lava is particularly common along underwater spreading centers.

[[File:Nur05018.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.18''': Pillow lava.]]

==Predicting Volcanic Eruptions==
Volcanic eruptions can be devastating, particularly to the people who are closer to volcanoes. As meteorologists attempt to predict, or forecast, hurricanes and tornadoes, so too do vulcanologist attempt to forecast volcanic eruptions. Although predicting volcanic eruptions is far from perfect, many pieces of evidence can indicate that a volcano is about to erupt. Some
of those factors are hard to measure, contributing to the difficulty in predicting eruptions.

===History of Volcanic Activities===
One important factor in predicting eruptions is a volcano's history. That is, we consider how long since it has erupted and the time span between its previous eruptions. Volcanoes are categorized into three subdivisions—active, dormant, and extinct. An '''active volcano''' is one that is currently erupting or shows signs of erupting in the near future. A '''dormant volcano''' no longer shows signs of activity, but has erupted in recent history (Figure 8.19). Finally, an extinct volcano is one that has not erupted in recent history and will probably not erupt again in the future. Both active and dormant volcanoes are heavily monitored because even dormant volcanoes could suddenly show signs of activity.

[[File:Napoli and Vesuvius.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.19''': Vesuvius is a dormant volcano near the city of Naples. Although it shows no current signs of eruption, it could one day become active.]]

===Earthquakes===
As magma beneath a volcano pushes upward, it shakes the ground and causes earthquakes. Although earthquakes probably occur every day near a volcano, the quantity and size of the earthquakes increases before an eruption. In fact, a volcano that is about to erupt may produce a continuous string of earthquakes, as magma moving underground creates stress on the neighboring rocks. In order to measure these earthquakes, scientists use seismographs that record the length and strength of each earthquake.

===Slope Deformation===
All that magma and gas pushing upwards can make the ground or the volcano's slope begin to swell. Sometimes, ground swelling reveals huge changes in the shape of a volcano. Most cases of ground deformation are subtle, though, and can only be detected by tiltmeters, which are instruments that measure the angle of the slope of a volcano. Additionally, ground swelling may cause increased rock falls and landslides.

===Gas Emissions===
Oftentimes, gases are able to escape a volcano before magma reaches the surface in an eruption. So, scientists can measure gas output, or gas emissions, in vents on or around the volcano. Gases, like sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and even water vapor can be measured at the site or, in some cases, at a distance with satellites. The amounts of gases and their ratios are calculated to help predict eruptions.

===Remote Monitoring===
As mentioned, some gases can be monitored using satellite technology (Figure 8.20). Satellites are able to measure other factors, too, like temperature readings of particularly warm spots at a volcano site or areas where the volcano surface is changing. As our technology continues to improve, scientists are better able to detect changes accurately and safely.

[[File:ERS 2.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.20''': An Earth-observation satellite before launch.]]

Although monitoring methods are getting better and better, it is still difficult to predict a volcanic eruption with certainty. No scientist or government agency wants to be considered alarmist by announcing that an eruption is going to occur and then it really doesn't. The cost and disruption to society of a large-scale evacuation would leave many people displeased and the scientists embarrassed. However, the possibility of saving lives and property most certainly makes the pursuit of eruption prediction a worthy cause.

==Lesson Summary==
* Volcanoes are produced when magma rises towards the Earth's surface because it is less dense than the surrounding rock.
* Volcanic eruptions can be non-explosive or explosive depending on the viscosity of the magma.
* Explosive type eruptions happen along the edges of continents and produce tremendous amounts of material ejected into the air.
* Non-explosive type eruptions mostly produce various types of lava, such as a'a, pāhoehoe and pillow lavas.
* Some signs that a volcano may soon erupt include earthquakes, surface bulging, gases emitted as well as other changes that can be monitored by scientists.

==Review Questions==
# What are the two basic types of volcanic eruptions?
# Several hundred years ago, a volcano erupted near the city of Pompeii. Archaeologists have found the remains of people embracing each other, suffocated by ash and rock that covered everything. What type of eruption must have this been?
# What is pyroclastic material?
# Name three liquids that have low viscosity and three that have high viscosity.
# What is the difference between a magma chamber and a mantle plume?
# The boiling point of water is 100&amp;deg;C. Why might water make an eruption more explosive?
# What are three names for non-explosive lava?
# What factors are considered in predicting volcanic eruptions?
# Why is predicting volcanoes so important?
# Given that astronomers are far away from the subjects they study, what evidence might they look for to determine the composition of a planet on which a volcano is found?

==Vocabulary==
; active volcano
: A volcano that is currently erupting or just about to erupt.
; dormant volcano
: A volcano that is not currently erupting, but that has erupted in the recorded past.
; effusive eruption
: A relatively gentle, non-explosive volcanic eruption.
; eruption
: The release of magma onto the Earth's surface. Usually an eruption is accompanied by the release of gases as well.
; explosive eruption
: A volcanic eruption that releases large amounts of gas, so that magma is violently thrown up into the air.
; extinct volcano
: A volcano that has not erupted in recorded history, and is considered unlikely to erupt again.
; magma chamber
: A region within Earth surrounded by solid rock and containing magma.
; pyroclast
: A rock made up of fragments of volcanic rock thrown into the air by volcanic eruptions.
; viscosity
: The &quot;thickness&quot; or &quot;stickiness&quot; of a liquid. The more viscous a liquid is, the harder it will be for the liquid to flow.

==Points to Consider==
* What types of evidence do you think would tell scientists whether an ancient volcanic eruption was explosive or non-explosive?
* Are all volcanoes shaped like tall mountains with a crater on the peak?
* What do you think is the origin of the names A'a and Pāhoehoe?
* Earthquakes do not always indicate that a volcano is going to erupt. What factors about an earthquake might indicate a relationship to a volcanic eruption?

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Mutex =

The Mutex class (loadable via &lt;code&gt;require 'thread'&lt;/code&gt;) is a way of guaranteeing concurrency for a specific block.

== Timing out a wait ==

You can time out a wait like this in 1.9.2 (or jruby)

&lt;pre&gt;
require 'thread'
a = Mutex.new
b = ConditionVariable.new
a.synchronize {
 a.wait(b, 3) # timeout after 3 secs
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

In 1.8 non jruby, you can use the timeout library, like

&lt;pre&gt;
require 'thread'
require 'timeout'
a = Mutex.new
b = ConditionVariable.new

begin
Timeout::timeout(3) {
  a.synchronize {
    a.wait(b)
  }
}
rescue Timeout::Error
 # timed out
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Step 1: Top edge pieces (cross) ==

[[Image:Rubiks 1.svg|thumb|right|A Rubik's cube with the top edges already solved.]]

The cube is assumed to be scrambled. The first thing to do is to choose a color, say white (it tends to stand out from the other colors on the cube). It's also a very good idea to always do a specific color first, since you will remember which colors are adjacent, which speeds things up considerably.

Notation used in this book for six faces: 
* U - Upper
* L - Left
* F - Front
* R - Right
* D - Down
* B - Back

How to read cubie positions: a ''cubie'' is either a corner or an edge piece. The UL piece, for instance, is an edge piece because it has only two colors. It is the edge piece with a one color on the U face and another color on the L face. Similarly, the URF piece is a corner (it has three colors), and it has a color on the U, R and F faces. The piece that is referred to depends on the orientation of the cube, which is why most solutions tell you to keep the cube with a certain color on top and a certain color in front (looking at the center sticker, since that one never moves).

When talking about a ''white-other'' color edge, this is an edge with one white sticker and one other color, which on a standard cube could be red, orange, blue or green.

The first step is to form a ''cross'' on the top face of the cube. Orient the cube so that the white center piece is on top. The aim is to get the correct pieces in the UL, UB, UR and UF locations. If you started with white, these pieces will be colored white-red, white-orange, white-blue and white-green (using a Rubik's brand cube). So, some of the following moves are needed (be sure to do those in the first step first):

* If a white-other color edge piece is on the U face:
** If white is in the U position, simply rotate the U face until the edge is lined up with its center. You should now see four stickers connected, e.g., white (center), white (edge), red (edge), red (center).
** If the piece is flipped in the up layer, then place the edge in the front layer and perform F U&amp;prime; R U ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?initscript=z2&amp;alg=FU%27RU&amp;stickers=cross demo]).
* If the piece is in the middle slice of the cube (the second layer):
** Hold the cube so that white is still on the U face and your piece is in the FR location. Find the spot where the piece should go. Rotate U until either F&amp;prime; or R can be applied to move the piece in the correct spot, so that the white face will move to the top. Make sure that the order of the edges in the top layer will still be correct. On a Rubik's brand cube, the order would be blue, red, green, orange. After placing the piece in the top layer, you can turn the U face until all correctly placed edges connect to their centers ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?initscript=z2&amp;alg=UF%27&amp;stickers=cross demo F], [http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?initscript=z2&amp;alg=UR&amp;stickers=cross demo R]). An alternative to this method is to move the white sticker to D face (if possible without disturbing the current cross pieces) and move on to the next step.
* If the white is on the D face, simply rotate D (or D&amp;prime;) until the piece is directly underneath its center, and apply F2 (assuming the piece is at the FD position) to put it in the correct location ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?initscript=z2&amp;alg=D%27F2&amp;stickers=cross demo]).
** If the other color is on the D face (the flipped version of the previous state), keep the piece in the F layer. Rotate D so that the piece is in the RD position, and apply R F&amp;prime; R&amp;prime; ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?initscript=z2&amp;alg=RF%27R%27&amp;stickers=cross demo]). (R&amp;prime; is not needed if the UR piece has not been placed correctly yet.)

There should now be a white cross formed on the top of the cube. By now, it will be possible to think how the edge pieces are located ''relative'' to one another, which should speed things up.

== Step 2: Top corner pieces ==

[[Image:Rubiks_2.svg|thumb|right|Rubik's cube with first layer solved.]]

The second step is to correctly position ''three'' of the U face corner pieces. The reason that only three and not four will be put into place is that this method uses a &quot;working space&quot; which greatly simplifies the later steps. There are three basic possibilities for putting corner pieces into place:

* The piece is on the D slice, with the white side ''not'' on the D side. In this case, rotate the D face so that it is directly underneath the location that it should go to. Now, hold the cube so that the piece is in the DRF spot, and the intended location is the URF spot.
** If white is on the R side of the corner piece in DRF, apply R&amp;prime; D&amp;prime; R ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?initscript=z2&amp;stickers=FL&amp;alg=R'D'R demo]).
** If white is on the F side of the corner piece in DRF, apply F D F&amp;prime; ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?initscript=z2&amp;stickers=FL&amp;alg=FDF' demo]).
* &lt;p&gt;The corner piece is on the D slice, but the white face is on the D side. Rotate the D face so that the corner piece is in the DRF spot, and the intended location is the URF spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now apply R&amp;prime; D2 R D R&amp;prime; D&amp;prime; R ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?initscript=z2&amp;stickers=FL&amp;alg=R'D2RDR'D'R demo]): Note that what is being done is R&amp;prime; D2 R to move the white side off the bottom of the cube, so that one of the moves in the previous section can be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also note that equivalent to this is: F D2 F&amp;prime; D&amp;prime; F D F&amp;prime; ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?initscript=z2&amp;stickers=FL&amp;alg=FD2F'D'FDF' demo]): for left-handed people this might make things easier. A right-handed person would probably do the &quot;R&amp;prime; D2 R &amp;hellip;&quot; move, without thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
* The corner piece in question is in the right spot but incorrectly rotated. Therefore, it must be rotated. Hold the cube so that it is in the URF location. Now,
** If the white side is on the R face, apply R&amp;prime; D&amp;prime; R D R&amp;prime; D&amp;prime; R ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?initscript=z2&amp;stickers=FL&amp;alg=R'D'RDR'D'R demo]).
** If the white side is on the F face, apply F D F&amp;prime; D&amp;prime; F D F&amp;prime; ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?initscript=z2&amp;stickers=FL&amp;alg=FDF'D'FDF' demo]).

So now one side should be done, except for one corner piece. This location will be used to swap corner pieces in and out, greatly simplifying later processes. The moves in the first two steps are really quite intuitive. After only a few repetitions, they will be simple and that's what you do.

== Step 3: Middle edge pieces ==

[[Image:Rubiks 3.svg|thumb|right|Rubik's cube with first two layers solved.]]

This step involves correctly placing three of the four edge pieces on the &quot;middle&quot; layer of the cube.

For these moves hold the cube so that the white face is on the bottom.
The only middle layer edge piece that is not to be positioned is the one right above the corner piece that was not positioned correctly in step 2.

Before you begin positioning edge pieces, you should rotate the middle layer so that all of the center pieces are correctly positioned.

First of all, make sure the white side is on the bottom, and the &quot;empty&quot; (i.e., incorrect) corner piece on the white side is in the DRF location. The middle layer edge pieces will all be positioned in this step, except for the FR one.

To move a piece into position, rotate the cube about its vertical axis, so that the intended location is the FR location. (For example, the FL piece is to be put in place. Rotate the cube a quarter turn counter-clockwise.) Now rotate the bottom slice so that the incorrect corner piece is in the DRF location. (So in the previous example &amp;ndash; for the FL piece &amp;ndash; first turn the cube, then apply D&amp;prime;.)

Now all is prepared for the move. The move to put the new edge piece into place can only be done if it is on the U slice. If it is, note which side is NOT on the U face. Either F&amp;prime; or R will need to be applied, depending on the orientation of the edge piece to be moved. Now, apply U until the piece to be moved is in the UF or UR (depending on the previous move) location, and then F or R&amp;prime;, to get it back to normal.

Here is an example: Yellow is the F center. Orange is the R center. The Yellow-Orange edge piece is to be positioned, to the FR position. The D face has already been rotated so that the DRF location does not contain a white corner piece. The Yellow-Orange piece is in the UB location. The Orange is the U side, and Yellow is the B side. Thus, apply F&amp;prime; U2 F ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?stickers=F2L&amp;alg=F'U2F demo]).

To continue, simply keep rotating D or D&amp;prime; and moving the cube to set up the same position, with an &quot;empty&quot; corner in DRF, the intended location at RF, and the piece to move in the U slice.
Note that in some cases the piece may already be in the correct location, but oriented incorrectly. In this case take it out first (i.e., put any edge piece with the color whose center is opposite white on the cube into that location) and then put it back in that spot. In other words, with the DRF corner &quot;empty&quot; and the offending piece in the FR spot, apply F&amp;prime; U&amp;prime; F U R U&amp;prime; R&amp;prime; ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?stickers=F2L&amp;alg=F'U'FURU'R' demo]).

Now two thirds of the cube should be done, less two pieces: a middle layer edge piece and its adjacent corner piece, that appears to take a chunk out of the bottom (white) layer. Note that it is possible for the &quot;empty&quot; corner piece on the bottom layer to get solved by accident. If so, just ignore it, and pretend that it is unsolved.

== Step 4: Solve remaining edge pieces ==

=== Solve first three remaining edge pieces (UF, UL, UB) ===

There are two basic parts to this step, as follows:

The goal of the whole step is to solve all of the 5 remaining edge pieces. The first part is to solve three of these (UF, UL, UB), and the second part is to solve the other two together.

First of all, hold the cube so that the &quot;empty&quot; edge piece is in the BR position, and thus the &quot;empty&quot; corner piece is in the DRB position. To do moves in this part, first of all move a piece into the BR location, then move it to the U face, to one of those UF, UL, or UB positions.

The move is as follows. First, optionally rotate U. Then, apply R&amp;prime; or B. Then rotate U the desired amount. Then do R or B&amp;prime; (to undo the first part of this move).

An example: Say the Blue-Yellow piece is in the BR location.
Furthermore, Blue is the U color, and Yellow is the L color.
The order would be: U (to put the UL location &amp;ndash; the destination &amp;ndash; in the right spot), B U&amp;prime; B&amp;prime;.

However, when actually trying to solve the cube quickly, instead of applying U&amp;prime; in the previous move, look to find the next edge piece that is required to put in the right location.

So rotate U until it is in the UB location, and then by applying B&amp;prime; return the cube to a stable position. Then, rotate U some amount to get the UL piece (Blue-Yellow in the example) back to the right place.

There is a tremendous amount of freedom in this sequence of moves.
In fact, there is no need to return the edge pieces to the correct spots in between repetitions of this move.

Simply realize how the pieces go with respect to one another, and then finally align them, when all three (UF, UL, UB) are done.

=== Remaining two edge pieces (BR, UR) ===
: ''(Note: this is not correct there are more than 4 possibilities.)''

This is the only step that requires any actual memorization. The moves from the other steps should become very natural after a short time.

There are four possibilities. The remaining edge pieces are the BR piece and the UR piece. Do the following:

* Luckily, the pieces are correct. Move to the next step.
* The pieces are in the correct locations, but incorrectly oriented. Apply B U&amp;prime; B&amp;prime; U R&amp;prime; U R U&amp;prime; ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?stickers=F2L&amp;alg=BU'B'UR'URU' demo]).
* Both edge pieces (BR and UR) have the same color on the R side of the piece, which is the same color as the R center. Apply U&amp;prime; R&amp;prime; U&amp;prime; R U&amp;prime; R&amp;prime; U&amp;prime; R U&amp;prime; ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?stickers=F2L&amp;alg=U'R'U'RU'R'U'RU' demo]).
* The other case (the UR piece has the R color on its U side, and B color on its R side, and the BR piece has the U color on its R side, and the R color on its B side). Apply B U B&amp;prime; U B U B&amp;prime; U2 ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?stickers=F2L&amp;alg=BUB'UBUB'U2 demo]).

To reduce memorization at the expense of some speed, two of these moves suffice. In other words, apply all three of these moves in any sequence to an all-edges correct cube, and the result will be an all-edges correct cube.

== Step 5: Position corner pieces ==

This step will move the remaining 4 unsolved corner pieces to their correct positions, irrespective of orientation. The basic strategy is to move the &quot;empty&quot; corner piece to DRB and the corner piece to be moved to UFL. A move (L D2 L&amp;prime;) is used to swap the two corners (as well as temporarily jumble up the cube). Then U slice is rotated such that the correct ''position'' for the corner (now in DRB) is in UFL. Then the move (L D2 L&amp;prime;) is applied again to undo the cube jumbling as well as move the corner to the correct position.

This shouldn't need to be done more than 3 times (since there are only 4 corners to move and the last two will swap with each other to their correct positions).

This step can be a little confusing at first. First of all, make sure the DRB piece is that &quot;empty&quot; (unsolved &amp;hellip; not missing!) corner piece.

Say the UFL piece is Blue-Yellow-Orange. But that piece should go in the URB position. Do the following moves: L D2 L&amp;prime; (move the piece in question out of the way &amp;ndash; to the DRB position), U2 (move the correct ''position'' to the UFL spot), L D2 L&amp;prime; (move the piece in question back to the U slice), U2 (undo the U twist done earlier).

'''One thing to note when doing this move, make sure the original UFL piece does not contain the color of the bottom face (white in the ongoing example).'''

Also note that it is satisfactory to rotate the U face before the move so that a particular corner piece can be moved into the UFL position so that it can be worked on. The only (slight) difference will be a need to rotate U at the end to make up for that.

Note that these U-rotations should be very obvious. Simply line up the top-layer edge pieces with their respective centers.

== Step 6: Orient corner pieces correctly ==

Corner pieces must be rotated in pairs &amp;ndash; ''one clockwise and one counter-clockwise''. If you combine two clockwise or counter-clockwise rotations, the rest of your cube will be compromised.

Find two incorrectly rotated corner pieces that are on the same slice.
Hold the cube so that one of the pieces in the UFL position and the other is somewhere on the U slice.

* To rotate a piece clockwise, apply L D2 L&amp;prime; F&amp;prime; D2 F ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?stickers=LL&amp;alg=LD2L'F'D2F demo]).
* To rotate a piece counter-clockwise, apply F&amp;prime; D2 F L D2 L&amp;prime; ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?stickers=LL&amp;alg=F'D2FLD2L' demo]).

Note that after orienting the first corner piece, apply U until the other corner piece goes in the UFL location. When the second corner piece has been oriented, turn U to undo the previous twisting (this should be fairly obvious).

Here's an explicit example &amp;ndash; the UFL piece needs rotating counter-clockwise, and the UFR piece needs rotating clockwise.
The full sequence would be as follows: F&amp;prime; D2 F L D2 L&amp;prime; (orient UFL piece), U (position other corner), L D2 L&amp;prime; F&amp;prime; D2 F (orient original UFR piece), U&amp;prime; (undoes rotation of U that was done earlier). ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?stickers=LL&amp;alg=F'D2FLD2L'ULD2L'F'D2FU' Demo].)

This pattern may need to be applied up to three times. Note that with this method only one clockwise and one counter-clockwise twist can be done; other methods twist 3 corners but have side-effects on edges.

If the two remaining corner pieces are diametrically opposed (e.g., at UFL and DRB), then apply R2 (in this case) to bring both of them onto the U slice. Then, do the sequence. Then apply R2 again to get to the original configuration ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?alg=R2F'D2FLD2L'ULD2L'F'D2FU'R2 demo]).

Congratulations, your cube should now be solved!

== Rotating the center faces ==

Some cubes have multi-color designs on each face rather than a single color, in which case the orientation of the center faces is an issue. Usually, solving the cube with the center faces oriented correctly is possible, and the fastest method; but there exists a (very slow) way to rotate two of the center faces at a time without affecting the rest of the cube. If you want to rotate the F and R center faces (both clockwise), simply repeat F R a full 105 times after each other. If you want to rotate F clockwise and R counter-clockwise, do F R&amp;prime;, etc. This method can be very time-consuming, however, so planning ahead while solving the rest of the cube is preferred &amp;ndash; that is, match the side center faces to the top edges, and hope the bottom turns out correctly. This less time-consuming sequence will rotate the top center face counter-clockwise (ccw) and the left center face clockwise (cw), each ''n'' quarter turns:

: (L&amp;prime; R F&amp;prime;B U&amp;prime; D) L&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (D&amp;prime; U B&amp;prime; F R&amp;prime; L) U&amp;prime;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;

With different notation, the sequence (''n'' = 1) can be abbreviated ([http://www.vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?type=Generator&amp;alg=MEM%27U%27ME%27M%27U demo]):

: (M E M&amp;prime;) U (M E&amp;prime; M&amp;prime;) U&amp;prime;

The result is the same when combined with a sequence to rotate the top center face two quarter turns:

: (U R L U2 R&amp;prime; L&amp;prime;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Left and top center faces are turned one quarter in same sense.

*Cubie- one of the small cubes inside the giant one
*Solved- an edge is considered solved if each side is next to the right center (eg. the red-yellow edge is between the red and yellow centers)
*Center- the cubie in the center of each side, they don't move relative to each other

== Scrambling the Cube ==
For consistency's sake, we will all scramble our cube as such for this Wikibook with White being the front and blue on top:

U B′ R2 D′ U′ R U2 B R′ B2 L2 R F2 R2 U2 R B U2 F2 L2 F2 D R B2 R2

== Step One- The Cross ==
The goal of this step is to make a plus sign out of solved edges.

=== Step 1a ===
Pick a color.  We will use white.  When you get good, it is advisable to pick the color to the cube.

=== Step 1b ===
Make the cross.  Unfortunately, there are no patterns (from here on, algorithms) for this step

R' U L F' R' B' U' L U

Turn the cube so the cross is on bottom before you proceed.

== Step Two- F2L ==

When most people think of volcanoes, they think of a tall mountain with a crater on the top, maybe a little snow at the summit and some trees scattered around the base. There are many volcanoes like this, but volcanoes exist in many other forms as well. Each type of volcano has characteristic features that distinguish it from other types. Volcanoes differ in appearance because of the composition of their magma and the processes that originally created them.

The tall cone shape you usually think of when you think of a volcano describes a composite volcano, one common form of volcanoes. Other types of volcanoes include the shield volcano, the cinder cone, and the supervolcano.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Describe the basic shapes of volcanoes.
* Compare the features of volcanoes.
* Describe the stages in the formation of volcanoes.

==Composite Volcanoes==
The picture below shows Mt. Fuji, a classic example of the '''composite volcano''' (Figure 8.21). This is the type of volcano many people think of when they imagine volcanoes. Composite volcanoes have broad bases and sides that get steeper and steeper as you get closer to the top. These volcanoes frequently have a large crater at the top created during its last eruption.

[[File:FujiSunriseKawaguchiko2025WP.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.21''': Mt. Fuji is a dormant composite volcano that is the highest mountain in Japan.]]
[[File:Stratovolcano.jpg|right|frame|'''Figure 8.22''': A composite or stratovolcano is created by many levels of alternating materials.]]

Composite volcanoes are also called stratovolcanoes because of the alternating layers, or '''strata''', of which they are made (Figure 8.22). The magma that creates stratovolcanoes tends to be more viscous, or thick. Viscous lava creates greater pressure which, in turn, tends to create explosive eruptions. In addition, the viscous lava cannot travel far down the sides of the volcano before it solidifies. This viscous lava thus creates steep sides on stratovolcanoes.

When a stratovolcano erupts, it ejects a great deal of pyroclastic material into the air, which then settles back down on the Earth. After an initial explosion, lava then flows from the volcano creating a second layer of material. As these layers solidify, they create alternating levels, or strata, of material. Ash from the volcanic eruption is also present between the lava layers along the edge of the volcano. Composite volcanoes are common along the Pacific Ring of Fire and other major tectonic plate boundaries where the presence of water in the magma chamber creates explosive eruptions.
{{clear}}

==Shield Volcanoes==
Shield volcanoes get their name from their shape—a huge shield laid on its side. Figure 8.23 shows the Mauna Loa Volcano. You can see that shield volcanoes do not have the steep mountainous sides of composite volcanoes. They have a very wide base and are much
flatter on the top than composite volcano. Although they are not steep, they may be very large. The Mauna Loa Volcano has a diameter of over 112 kilometers (70 miles) and forms a significant part of the island of Hawaii. The Mauna Kea Volcano, also in Hawaii, is another shield volcano that is over ten kilometers (6 miles) high from its base below sea level to its peak.

[[File:Mauna Loa.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.23''': The Mauna Loa Volcano in Hawaii is the largest shield volcano on Earth.]]
[[File:Shield volcano.jpg|right|frame|'''Figure 8.24''': A shield volcano is built by layers of more fluid lava that spreads out over broad areas.]]

Shield volcanoes are more common at spreading centers or volcanic hot spots in the middle of tectonic plates (Figure 8.24). The magma that creates shield volcanoes is less viscous, so it flows much more easily. For this reason, the eruptions of shield volcanoes are non-explosive. In addition, the less viscous lava spreads out more, which makes shield volcanoes much larger and flatter than stratovolcanoes. Although shield volcanoes are built by many layers over time, the composition of the layers do not alternate between ash and lava, as they do in stratovolcanoes.
{{clear}}
==Cinder Cones==
[[File:Paricutin 30 612.jpg|200px|thumb|'''Figure 8.25''': Paricutín erupting in 1943, when it first formed. Cinder cones like this one rarely reach even 300 meters high.]]

'''Cinder cones''' are both the most common type of volcano and also the smallest. The cinder cone resembles a composite volcano but on a much smaller scale. They rarely reach even 300 meters in height but have even steeper sides than a composite volcano. They usually have a crater at the summit. Cinder cones are composed of small fragments of rock piled on top of one another. These volcanoes usually do not produce streams of lava.

In 1943, a farmer in Mexico witnessed the first eruption of a cinder cone in his field (Figure 8.25). Within a year, the cinder cone Paricutín grew to 336 meters high. By 1952, it grew to a peak of 424 meters tall, and then stopped erupting. This rapid growth and single eruption cycle is characteristic of cinder cones. For this reason, cinder cones do not reach the sizes of
stratovolcanoes or shield volcanoes. Often, cinder cones appear near larger volcanoes, but they also may be found away from all other volcanoes, as was the case with Paricutín. The exact composition of a cinder cone depends on the composition of the lava ejected from the Earth.
{{clear}}
==Supervolcanoes==
[[File:Santorini Landsat.jpg|250px|thumb|'''Figure 8.26''': The caldera at Santorini in Greece is so large that its circular shape can only be seen by satellite.]]

In certain areas of the world, huge '''calderas''' have been found to be the remains of volcanic eruptions of enormous scale (Figure 8.26). These calderas are volcanic features that are formed by the collapse of a huge amount of land due to the powerful eruptions. Caldera comes from Latin word, meaning cauldron. Calderas are generally circular shaped geographic formations like the picture in figure 6. These are not singular mountains but entire geographical areas. Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming is another caldera that has blown about a hundred times in the last 16 million years.

'''Supervolcanoes''' represent the most dangerous type of volcano. An eruption from a supervolcano could change life on Earth as we know it for many years. Supervolcanoes were not even accepted in volcanology until this millennium. Many supervolcano eruptions are thought to have occurred, the most recent in New Zealand less than 2000 years ago. That explosion was thought to have ejected about 100 cubic kilometers of material. A supervolcano eruption near what is now Colorado was thought to have let loose over 5,000 cubic kilometers of material millions of years ago. In comparison, the Mt. Saint Helens eruption ejected about 1 cubic kilometer of material.

The eruptions from supervolcanoes can be so large that the ash ejected into the air blocks the Sun and lowers the temperature on the entire planet. The lowered temperatures caused by these eruptions is called a volcanic winter. A supervolcano eruption at Lake Toba in northern Sumatra may have annihilated about 60% of the world's human population about 75,000 years ago. One can only imagine how such a huge eruption would change the world in modern times.

The largest supervolcano in North America is Yellowstone, which had three super eruptions at 2.1 million, 1.3 million and 640,000 years ago, and much more recent smaller (but still enormous) eruptions. Long Valley caldera, south of Mono Lake in California, is the second largest supervolcano in North America, erupting extremely hot and explosive rhyolite around 700,000 years ago. An earthquake swarm in 1980 alerted geologists to the possibility of another eruption in the future, but the timing of such an event is unknown.

Supervolcanoes are a fairly new idea so the exact cause of supervolcano eruptions is still debated. However, scientists believe that an entire and very large magma chamber erupts in a catastrophic explosion. This enormous eruption creates a huge hole or caldera where the surface area collapses.

==Lesson Summary==
* Composite cones, shield volcanoes, cinder cones and supervolcanoes are some of the types of volcanoes formed.
* Composite cones are tall, cone shaped volcanoes that produce explosive eruptions.
* Shield volcanoes form very large, gently sloped volcanoes with a wide base.
* Cinder cones are the smallest volcanic landform. They are formed from accumulation of many small fragments of ejected material.
* A caldera forms when an explosive eruption leaves a large crater when the mountain blows apart.
* Supervolcanoes are tremendously devastating types of volcanoes that could destroy large areas when they erupt.

==Review Questions==
# Rank the four types of volcanoes in order from smallest to largest in diameter.
# What factor is most important in determining the type of volcano formed in a given area?
# Which type of volcano is most common?
# Why is it that pahoehoe and a'a lava are more frequent in shield volcanoes than in composite volcanoes?
# Why do you think that cinder cones are short-lived?
# If supervolcanoes are so big, why do you think it took so long for scientists to discover them?

==Vocabulary==
; caldera
: Circular-shaped geographic features formed from a massive eruption of an ancient volcano, and the subsequent collapse of the volcano back into the ground.
; cinder cone
: A smaller volcano that grows rapidly but only erupts over a short period of the time. Cinder cones are composed of small rock fragments piled on top of one another. They rarely are more than 300 m in height.
; composite volcano
: A volcano with a broad base, steep sides, and often a crater at the top. The volcano is composed of alternating layers of ash and lava flows. Also called a stratovolcano.
; strata
: Layers of rock that are similar in composition to one another.
; supervolcano
: A massive volcanic eruption that is rare but incredibly powerful. Thousands of cubic kilometers of matter can be ejected, and the dust and ash from their eruption can cool the world's climate for years.

==Points to Consider==
* Composite volcanoes and volcanic cones usually have craters on the top. Why are the craters not always circular, but sometimes &quot;U&quot; or horseshoe-shaped?
* A shield volcano is relatively flat, and a composite volcano is relatively steep because of the type of magma that creates them. What process might create a volcano that is more steep than a shield volcano but not as steep as a composite volcano?
* Some people have theorized that if a huge asteroid hits the Earth, the results would be catastrophic. How might an asteroid impact and a supervolcano eruption be similar?

As you know, magma is molten rock found beneath the Earth's surface. Sometimes, it appears at the surface of the Earth as lava after moving through a volcano. At other times, magma does not come to the surface, but stays underground. In both cases, the magma eventually solidifies and the resulting rocks and formations are igneous. The rocks that solidify beneath the ground are called '''intrusive''' rocks, while those that solidify above the surface are called '''extrusive''' rocks. Extrusive rocks are sometimes small rocks that you can hold in your hand. At other times, entire landforms are created when lava flows onto the surface. Intrusive rocks do not always remain hidden below the surface. They can appear on the surface when rocks that once covered them are eroded away, exposing the intrusive igneous rock. Hot springs and geysers are some more examples of surface features related to igneous rock.

==Lesson Objectives==
* List and describe landforms created by lava.
* Explain how magma creates different landforms.
* Describe the processes that create hot springs and geysers.

==Landforms from Lava==
The most obvious landforms created by lava are volcanoes. Volcanoes, of course, are the places where lava comes to the surface. As already discussed, volcanoes come in many forms, most commonly as cinder cones, stratovolcanoes, and shield volcanoes. However, lava can create other notable landforms, as described below.

===Lava Domes===
When lava is fairly viscous, it is thick and flows slowly. Although it might not be so viscous that it causes an explosive eruption, it can create a large sort of round &quot;blob&quot; or a lava dome. Because it is so thick, it does not flow far from the vent from which it came. In fact, lava flows often make mounds right in the middle of craters at the top of volcanoes (Figure 8.27 and Figure 8.28).

[[File:Valle Grande dome.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.27''': Lava domes are large, round landforms created by thick lava that does not travel far from the vent.]]

[[File:MSH06 aerial crater from north high angle 09-12-06.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.28''': Sometimes lava domes are formed in the crater of composite volcanoes. This lava dome is forming in the crater of Mt. St. Helens in Washington State.]]

===Plateaus===
A '''lava plateau''' is caused by a large amount of less viscous lava that flows over a large area. When it solidifies, it creates a large, flat surface of igneous rock. Some plateaus are huge, like the Columbia Plateau in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho that covers over 161,000 square kilometers (63,000 square miles).

===Land Area===
Another important land formation created by lava is islands. The Hawaiian Islands are formed from solidified lava from shield volcanoes that have grown over the last 5 million years (Figure 8.29). The land area grows as lava continues to solidify on the coast or emerges from beneath the water.

[[File:Hawaiilavawestcoast.JPG|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.29''': Solidified lava flows created the island of Hawaii.]]

==Landforms from Magma==
Of course, not all magma reaches the surface. Sometimes magma stays beneath the ground where it solidifies. These formations are called '''intrusions''' (Figure 8.30). Because they form underground, they only become land formations if they arrive at the surface of the Earth. This occurs because of weathering, erosion and plate tectonics. In other words, when tectonic plates collide, they create mountain ranges where one plate is lifted in a subduction zone. This lifting (which occurs at a rate of centimeters per year) and subsequent erosion can eventually uncover intrusive rock formations. As erosion removes the topmost rocks and soil, solidified magma is exposed in the same form in which it cooled and solidified many years before.

[[File:Devils Tower CROP.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.30''': Devil's Tower in Wyoming is a huge rock formation that was once magma that cooled within a volcano. It rises to nearly 400 meters from its base.]]

==Hot Springs and Geysers==
Beneath the surface of the Earth, water works its way through porous rocks or soil. Most caves, for example, are results of water's erosion of the ground. At times, that water crosses paths with volcanic activity. The same heat that melts rock into lava heats the water beneath the surface. If the water makes its way to the surface, it may emerge as either a hot spring or a geyser.

===Hot Springs===
When that water comes to the surface under regular pressure, it creates a '''hot spring''' (Figure 8.31). A hot spring is a crack in the Earth through which water reaches the surface, after being heated below the ground. Many people disagree on the exact definition of a hot spring. However, everyone agrees that the water's temperature is higher than normal. The water in hot springs can even reach temperatures in the hundreds of degrees Celsius beneath the surface. Most hot springs do not reach those great temperatures. In fact, many hot springs are used by people as natural hot tubs. Many people believe that hot springs hold curative properties. Hot springs are found all over the world, even in Antarctica!

[[File:Jigokudani hotspring in Nagano Japan 001.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 8.31''': Even some animals enjoy relaxing in nature's hot tubs.]]

===Geysers===
[[File:Old Faithfull-pdPhoto.jpg|200px|thumb|'''Figure 8.32''': Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone National Park during an eruption.]]

Like hot springs, '''geysers''' are created by water that is heated beneath the Earth's surface. When water is both superheated by magma and flows through a narrow passageway underground, the environment becomes ideal for a geyser. The narrow passageway traps the heated water underground, where heat and pressure continue to build. Sooner or later, the pressure grows so great that the superheated water bursts out onto the surface. This explosion is called a geyser. There are only a few areas in the world where the conditions are right for the formation of geysers. About 1,000 geysers exist worldwide and about half of those are found in the United States of America. Perhaps the most famous geyser is Old Faithful, which erupts every 60 to 70 minutes in a plume of hot water nearly 60 meters in the air. It is rare for a geyser to erupt regularly, which contributes to Old Faithful's fame (Figure 8.32).

==Lesson Summary==
* Very thick lava that doesn't travel very far can produce lava domes at or near the Earth's surface or even within a volcano.
* Lava plateaus form from large lava flows that spread out over large areas.
* Many islands are formed from volcanoes.
* Magma can also cool and crystallize below the Earth's surface forming igneous intrusions.
* When magma heats groundwater, it can form hot springs and geysers.

==Review Questions==
# What is the difference between intrusive and extrusive rocks?
# What are four different landforms created by lava?
# What is the major difference between hot springs and geysers?
# The geyser called Old Faithful has been erupting for perhaps hundreds of years. One day, it could stop. Why might geysers completely stop erupting?
# After earthquakes, hot springs sometimes stop bubbling, and new hot springs form. Why might this be?

==Vocabulary==
; intrusive
: Describing a volcanic rock that cooled underground. Intrusive rocks contain large mineral crystals that are visible to the naked eye.
; extrusive
: Describing a volcanic rock that cooled at the earth's surface. Extrusive rocks have small crystals, and may contain air bubbles.
; lava dome
: A dome-shaped plug of viscous lava that cools near the vent of a volcano.
; intrusion
: A rock mass formed by magma solidifying underground.
; hot spring
: A stream of hot water that flows out of the ground continuously.
; geyser
: A fountain of hot water and steam that shoots into the air at either regular or random intervals. The water in a geyser encounters some sort of constriction underground, which forces pressure to build up in the water, eventually causing the geyser to erupt.

==Points to Consider==
* What might the Earth look like if there were no tectonic plates? Can you think of any planets or satellites (moons) that may not have tectonic plates? How is their surface different from that of the Earth?
* What kind of land formations have you seen that may have been created by volcanic activity? Were the formations made of extrusive or intrusive rock?

==Lesson Objectives==
* Define mechanical and chemical weathering.
* Discuss agents of weathering.
* Give examples of each type of weathering.

==What is Weathering?==
Weathering is the process that changes solid rock into '''sediments'''. Geologists use the word sediment to describe all different sizes of rock particles. Sediment includes really large pieces of rock, like boulders or gravel, but it also includes sand and much smaller particles, called silt and clay. In the process of weathering, rock is disintegrated and decomposed. Disintegration of rock happens as rock is broken into pieces. Once the pieces are separated from the rocks, '''erosion''' is the process that moves those pieces. Gravity is one way that pieces of rock move, as broken pieces of rock fall or tumble from high places to lower ones. Gravity causes large and small pieces to fall from cliffs, as well as moving water in rivers and streams from mountaintops to the ocean. Wind and glaciers also move pieces of rock from one place to another. Wind moves sand sized and smaller pieces of rock through the air. Glaciers can move all sizes of particles, from extremely large boulders to the tiniest fragments.

Weathering happens at the Earth's surface. When most rocks form, they are forming at very high temperatures and pressures. This is a very different environment than the low temperatures and pressures at Earth's surface. When rocks reach Earth's surface, weathering
causes them to change form. The new form will include minerals that are stable at the low temperatures and pressures of Earth's surface. So while powerful forces on Earth, such as those resulting from plate tectonics, work to build huge mountains like the Himalayas or majestic volcanoes like Mt Fuji, the forces of weathering gradually wear away rocks, changing once tall mountains into hills and even plains. The Appalachian Mountains along the east coast of North America were once as tall as the Himalayas! So what happened?

No human being can watch for millions of years as mountains are slowly built, nor can we watch as those same mountains gradually wear away. However you probably have been able to ride your bike or walk along a brand new sidewalk or road. What do you experience? The new road or sidewalk is smooth and even. If it was made well, there won't be any cracks or bumps. Does that smooth surface stay that way? Certainly over millions of years, it will completely disappear, but we don't have to wait that long. If you live in a part of the world that has cold winters, you may only have to wait one year to start seeing changes. We will talk next about what types of weathering change that brand new, smooth and even sidewalk into areas that are rough or cracked, chipped or buckled (Figure 9.1).

[[File:Pothole Small.jpg|center|frame|'''Figure 9.1''': You can see the once smooth road surface has cracks and fractures, plus a large pothole.]]

==Mechanical Weathering==
'''Mechanical weathering''' (also called physical weathering) is the breaking of rock into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces will be just like the bigger rock, the pieces will just be smaller. That means the rock has been changed mechanically (or physically) without changing its composition. The smaller pieces will have the same minerals, in just the same proportions as the original rock. You could actually use the expression, 'A chip off the old block' to describe mechanical weathering! The main agents of mechanical weathering are water, wind, ice, and gravity. You will see how each of these works to break rock into smaller pieces.

There are two main ways that rocks can break apart into smaller pieces. The way that is most common in cold climates is called '''ice wedging'''. Ice wedging is the main form of mechanical weathering in any climate that regularly cycles above and below the freezing point (Figure 9.2). Some places where this happens include Earth's polar regions and mid latitudes. It also happens in the colder climates of higher elevations, like mountainous regions.

[[File:Mechanical weathering.png|center|frame|'''Figure 9.2''': Water seeps into cracks and fractures in rock. As it freezes, it expands which wedges the rock apart.]]

This is how it works. When water changes from a liquid into a solid (ice), it increases in volume. This is a very unusual property. Most substances contract (get smaller) as they change from a liquid to a solid, but water does just the opposite. You may have already experienced this if you ever filled an ice cube tray all the way to the top with water and then put it into the freezer. The ice cubes will be much larger than the amount of water you first put in. You may have also made the mistake of putting your favorite soda into the freezer to cool it down quickly. If you leave your drink in the freezer too long, it will expand so much that it bends or pops the can. Ice wedging happens for the same reason. Water works its way into cracks and fractures in rock, and then expands as that water freezes. The ice takes up more space than the water did, which wedges the rock apart, physically breaking the rock into pieces. Ice wedging breaks apart so much rock that you will find large piles of broken rock at the base of a cliff or mountain, as broken pieces separate and tumble down its sides. Ice wedging will work quickly, breaking apart lots of rock in areas that go above and below the freezing point every night and day, and also in areas that cycle with the seasons.

'''Abrasion''' is another form of mechanical weathering. Abrasion can happen anywhere. All that is needed is one rock bumping against another rock. Gravity can cause abrasion as a rock tumbles down a mountainside or cliff. Moving water causes abrasion as particles carried in the water collide and bump against one another. Strong winds can pick up pieces of sand and blast surfaces with those sand grains. Finally, the ice in glaciers carries many bits and pieces of rock. As the glacier moves, pieces of rock embedded in the ice scrape against the rocks below. Broken pieces of rock tumbling down a mountain stream or tossed about by
waves crashing onto the shore, will become smooth and rounded as abrasions smooth and round the sharp or jagged edges. If you have ever collected beach glass or cobbles from a stream, you have benefited from the work of abrasion.

Scientists talk about a few other types of mechanical weathering but ice wedging and abrasion are the two most important types. Without these two types of mechanical weathering, very little rock would break apart and that would slow down the rate of chemical weathering as well. Sometimes biological elements can do the work of mechanical weathering. This could happen slowly as a plant's roots grow into a crack or fracture in rock and gradually grow larger, wedging open the crack. Burrowing animals can also break apart rock as they dig for food or to make living spaces for themselves. Today, of course, human beings do quite a bit of mechanical weathering, whenever we dig or blast into rock to build homes, roads, subways, or to quarry stone for construction or other uses.

Actually whenever there is mechanical weathering, it increases the rate of chemical weathering. This happens because as rock breaks into smaller pieces, the surface area of the pieces increases (Figure 9.3). With more surfaces exposed, there are more places for chemical weathering to occur. Let’s say you wanted to make some hot chocolate on a cold day. You can imagine how hard it would be to get a big chunk of chocolate to dissolve in your milk or hot water. Maybe you could make hot chocolate from some smaller pieces like chocolate chips, but it is much easier to add a powder to your milk. This is because the smaller the pieces are, the more surface area they have and the easier it is to dissolve in the milk.

[[File:Weathering and surface area.png|center|frame|'''Figure 9.3''': As rock breaks into smaller pieces, overall surface area increases.]]

[[File:Salt weathering in gozo.jpg|500px|center|thumb|Salt weathering of building stone on the island of Gozo, Malta.]]

==Chemical Weathering==
Another important type of weathering that happens on the Earth's surface is '''chemical weathering'''. Chemical weathering is different than mechanical weathering because with this type of weathering, rock is changed, not just in size of pieces, but changed in composition. This means that one type of mineral changes into a different mineral. The reason chemical weathering happens is that most minerals form at high pressure or high temperatures, deep within the Earth. When rocks reach the Earth’s surface, they are now at very low temperatures and pressures. This is a very different environment from the one in which
they formed. The environment at Earth's surface is so different that these minerals are no longer stable. That's where chemical weathering begins. Minerals formed deep within the Earth must change to minerals that are stable at Earth's surface. Chemical weathering is important because it starts the process of changing solid rock into the soil we need to grow food and for the plants we need for our clothing and medicine. The way that chemical weathering works is through chemical reactions that cause changes in the rock.

There are many types of chemical weathering because there are many agents of chemical weathering. You probably remember that mechanical weathering is caused by several agents, such as water, wind, ice,and gravity. Well, water is also an agent of chemical weathering, so that makes it a double agent! Two other important agents of chemical weathering are carbon dioxide and oxygen. We will talk about each of these one at a time.

The minerals that make up most of the Earth's crust are called silicate minerals. These minerals are mostly made of just eight elements; oxygen (O), silicon (Si), aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), potassium (K) and sodium (Na). When chemical weathering occurs, the elements that make up the minerals react to form new minerals. The minerals that form at the lowest temperatures and pressures (closest to the situation at the Earth's surface) are the most stable while minerals that form from very hot magmas or at very high pressures are the least stable. The elements sodium, calcium, potassium and magnesium actually dissolve easily in water. Iron reacts with oxygen, which leaves atoms of silicon, oxygen and aluminum to combine to form new minerals, like clay minerals.

Water is an amazing molecule. It has a very simple chemical formula, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which means it is made of just two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. Even though it is simple to remember, water is pretty remarkable in terms of all the things it can do. Water is an excellent solvent. The way that a water molecule joins together allows water to attract lots of other elements, separate them from their compounds and dissolve them. Water is such a good solvent that some types of rock can actually completely dissolve in water. Other minerals change by adding water into their structure.

'''Hydrolysis''' is a chemical reaction between a mineral and water. When this reaction takes place, water itself separates into ions. These ions grab onto other ions, dissolving them in water. As the dissolved elements are carried away, we say that these elements have been '''leached'''. Through hydrolysis, a mineral like potassium feldspar is changed into a clay mineral. Once clay minerals have formed, they are stable at the Earth's surface.

Carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) combines with water as raindrops fall through the air in our atmosphere. This makes a weak acid, called carbonic acid. This happens so often that carbonic acid is a very common, weak acid found in nature. This acid works to dissolve rock. It also slowly changes the paint on a new car or eats away at sculptures and monuments. The normal situation can be made worse when we add pollutants to the air. Any time we burn any fossil fuel, it adds nitrous oxide to the air. When we burn coal rich in sulfur, it adds sulfur dioxide to the air. As nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide react with water, it forms nitric acid and sulfuric acid. These are the two main components of acid rain. Acid rain accelerates chemical weathering.

[[File:Pollution - Damaged by acid rain.jpg|500px|center|thumb|A monument damage by acid rain.]]

'''Oxidation''' is the type of chemical reaction that happens when oxygen reacts with elements at the Earth's surface. Oxygen is very strongly chemically reactive. The type of oxidation that you are probably most familiar with produces rust when iron reacts with oxygen (Figure 9.4). Many minerals are rich in iron. They break down as the iron oxidizes, forming new compounds. Iron oxide produces the red color in soils. Chemical weathering can also be contributed to by plants and animals. As plant roots take in soluble ions as nutrients, certain elements are exchanged. Plant roots and bacterial decay use carbon dioxide in the process of respiration.

[[File:Rust and dirt.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 9.4''': When iron rich minerals oxidize, they produce the familiar red color found in rust.]]

==Differential Weathering==
Rates of weathering depend on several factors. Different types of rocks weather at different rates. Certain types of rock, like granite, are very resistant to weathering. Igneous rocks tend to weather slowly because it is hard for water to penetrate them. Other types of rock, like limestone and marble are easily weathered because they dissolve easily in weak acids. More resistant rocks remain at the surface and form ridges or hills. Devil's Tower in Wyoming is an interesting example of how different types of rock weather at different rates (Figure 9.5). As the softer materials of the surrounding rocks were worn away, the resistant center of the volcano remained behind. Different minerals also weather at different rates. Some minerals completely dissolve in water. As less resistant minerals dissolve away, a rock's surface becomes pitted and rough. When a less resistant mineral dissolves, more resistant mineral grains are released from the rock.

[[File:Devils Tower Wyoming.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 9.5''': Devil's Tower is an amazing example of differential weathering. All that remains of the volcano today is this central plug of resistant lava that forms the tower.]]

Most importantly, the climate of a region influences weathering. Climate is determined by the temperature of a region plus the amount of rainfall it receives. As the amount of precipitation increases, so does the rate of solution and the number of chemical reactions. In general, as the amount of rainfall increases, so does the degree of weathering. Remember that water is an agent of both mechanical and chemical weathering, so when water is not available, the rate of weathering slows tremendously. Two amazing examples of preservation include mummification and freezing. Both of these situations occur in the absence of liquid water. Therefore a dry climate will produce the lowest rate of weathering, followed by a very cold climate, regardless of the amount of rainfall it receives. The rates of highest weathering would occur in a wet climate that is also warm or hot. As the temperature of a region increases, so does the rate of chemical reactions. For each 10&amp;deg;C increase in average temperature, the rate of chemical reactions doubles. The warmer a climate is, the more types of vegetation it will have and the greater the rate of biological weathering. This happens because plants and bacteria grow and multiply faster in warmer temperatures. If you want an easy way to remember these examples, think about where you would put your sandwich if you want it to stay fresh for a while. How quickly does it go bad in your lunch box? Where would you put food from the grocery store if you wanted to save it for a week or more?

Some resources are actually concentrated for us by the actions of weathering. In tropical climates, intense chemical weathering carries away all soluble minerals, leaving behind just the least soluble components. The aluminum oxide, bauxite forms this way and is our main source of ore for producing aluminum. The actions of moving water can also concentrate heavier minerals, like gold. This process fueled the gold rush out west in North America in the 1800s.

* Describe how soil forms from existing rocks.
* Describe the different textures and components of soil.
* Draw and describe a soil profile.
* Define the three climate related soils: a pedalfer, pedocal and laterite soil.

==Characteristics and Importance of Soil==
Thank goodness for mechanical and chemical weathering, because without these forces working to breakdown rock we would not have any soil on Earth. It is unlikely that humans would have been able to live on Earth without soil! Your life and the lives of many organisms depend on soil. We get wood, paper, cotton, medicines and even pure water from soil. So soil is a very important resource. Even though it is actually only a very thin layer on Earth's surface over the solid rocks below, it is the place where our atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere and the rocks of the Earth meet. Within our soil layer, reactions between solid rock, liquid
water and air take place. It is a mistake on our part to disregard this important resource, yet we say things like &quot;soiled&quot; or &quot;dirty&quot; when we talk about ruining something. Our precious soil resource needs to be carefully managed and cared for. If we neglect or abuse the soil we have, it will not remain the renewable resource that we have relied on throughout human existence.

We can think about soil as a living resource or an ecosystem all by itself. Within soil, there are many elements. It is a complex mixture of different materials. Some of them are '''inorganic''', like the products of weathered rock, including pebbles, sand, silt and clay particles. There are also bits of '''organic''' materials, formed from the partial breakdown and decomposition of plants and animals. In general, the pieces of rock and minerals make up about half of the soil, with the other half made of organic materials. In between, in the spaces of soil, there are thousands or even millions of living organisms. Those organisms could be earthworms, ants, bacteria, or fungi, as well as many other types of organisms. In between the solid pieces, there are tiny spaces filled with air and water. In some soils, the organic portion could be entirely missing, such as desert sand. At the other extreme, a soil could be completely organic, such as the materials that make up peat in a bog or swamp. The organic materials are necessary for a soil to be fertile. The organic portion provides the nutrients, like nitrogen, needed for strong plant growth. We will learn about that organic portion in just a bit.

==Soil Formation==
How well soil forms and what type of soil forms depends on several different factors. Some of these factors are the climate, the original rock the soil formed from, the slope, the amount of time and biological activity. Climate is ultimately the most important factor and will determine the type of soil that forms in a particular region. The climate of a region is principally determined by temperature and the amount of precipitation. This also influences the type of vegetation that grows in the region. We can identify different climates by the types of plants that grow there. Depending on how closely you look, we can divide land areas into many different climate regions (Figure 9.6).

[[File:ClimateMapWorld.png|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 9.6''': Climate is the most important factor in determining the type of soil that will form in a particular area.]]

Given enough time, even different rock types will produce a similar climate related soil. Climate is such an important factor that even the same type of rock in different climates will produce a different climate related soil. This is true because the rocks on Earth are predominantly composed of eight elements and as rock breaks down, there will mostly be just these eight elements. Surely, if an element is not present in the original rock, then it will also not be present in the soil that forms from it. The amount of precipitation in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. The more it rains, the more rainwater passes through the soil and the more it reacts chemically with the particles. Those reactions are most efficient in the top layers of the soil and become less effective as the water continues to percolate through lower layers of soil. The top layers of soil in contact with the freshest water react most. Increased rainfall in a region increases the amount of rock that is dissolved as well as the amount of material carried away by moving water. As materials are carried away, new surfaces are exposed and this also increases the rate of weathering.

The temperature for a region is important too. The rate of chemical reactions increases with higher temperatures. For every 10&amp;deg;C increase in temperature, the rate of chemical reactions doubles. Warmer regions also have more vegetation because plants and bacteria grow and multiply faster. This means that in tropical regions, where temperatures and amounts of rainfall are consistently high, thick soils form with no unstable minerals and therefore no nutrients. Conversely, arid regions produce thin soils, rich in unstable minerals. The rate of soil formation increases with greater amounts of time. The longer the amount of time that soil remains in a particular area, the greater the degree of alteration.

The original rock is the source of the inorganic portion of the soil. Chemical reactions from weathering break down the rock's original minerals into sand, silt and clays. A soil is called a '''residual soil''' when it forms in place, with the underlying rock breaking down to form the layers of soil that reside above it. Only about one third of the soils in the United States
form this way. The rest of the soils form from materials that have been transported in from somewhere else. These soils are called '''transported soils'''. Glaciers bring bits of rock from far away, depositing the materials they carried as the ice of the glacier melts. Wind and rivers also transport materials from their places of origin. These soils form from the loose particles that have been transported in to a new location and deposited. For transported materials, the rate of soil formation is faster because the transported materials have already been weathered. The closer the materials are to their place of origin, the greater the influence of the original materials. The further those materials move from their origin, the greater the degree of weathering and the influence of the original materials becomes obscured.

Soils thicken as the amount of time available for weathering increases. The warmer the temperatures, the more rainfall and greater amount of time, the thicker the soils will become. Biological activity produces the organic material and nutrients in soil. The partial decay of plant material and animal remains also forms organic acids which in turn increase the rate of soil formation and the rate of weathering. The organic material increases the ability of the soil to hold water, create a soil’s structure and enhance its fertility and ability to be cultivated.

The decayed remains of plant and animal life are called '''humus'''. Humus is an extremely important part of the soil. It coats the mineral grains, binding them together into clumps that then hold the soil together. The humus in soil also increases the porosity and water holding capacity of a soil. Humus helps to buffer rapid changes in soil acidity and helps the soil to hold its nutrients. Decomposing organisms in the soil breakdown the complex organic molecules of plant matter and animal remains to form simpler inorganic molecules that are soluble in water. Bacteria in the soil change atmospheric nitrogen into nitrates.

One indicator of a soil's fertility is its color. Soils that are rich in nitrogen and contain a high percentage of organic materials are usually black or dark brown in color. Soils that are nitrogen poor and low in organic material might be gray or yellow or even red in color.

==Soil Texture and Composition==
The inorganic portion of soil is made of many different size particles. In addition to many particle sizes, there can be different proportions of each particle size. The combination of these two factors determines some of the properties of the soil. A soil will be very '''permeable''', which means that water will flow through it easily, if the spaces between the inorganic particles are large enough and are well connected. Soils that have lots of very small spaces tend to be water holding soils. Clays are an example of a type of soil that holds water. When clay is present in a soil, the soil is heavier and holds together more tightly. Sandy or silty soils are considered 'light' soils because they are permeable, water draining types of soils. When a soil contains a mixture of grain sizes, the soil is called a '''loam'''. When soil scientists want to precisely determine the soil type, they measure the percentage of sand, silt and clay and plot this information on a triangular diagram, with each type of soil at one corner (Figure 9.7).

[[File:Soil texture triangular plot.png|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 9.7''': Soil texture triangular plot diagram.]]

Soil scientists use a diagram like this to plot the percentages of sand, silt, and clay in a soil. The soil type can then be determined from the location on the diagram. At the top, a soil would be a clay; at the left corner, it would be a sand and at the right corner it would be a silt. Regions in the lower middle with less than 50% clay are called loams.

==Soil Horizons and Profiles==
A residual soil forms from the underlying bedrock. This happens over many years, as mechanical and chemical weathering slowly change solid rock into soil. The more time available, the greater the degree of alteration that will occur. Perhaps the first changes to bare rock would be cracks or fractures due to mechanical weathering from ice wedging. Then plants like lichens or grasses become established. As more and more layers of material weather, the soil develops '''soil horizons''', as each layer becomes progressively altered. The place where the greatest degree of weathering occurs is the top layer. Each successive, lower layer is altered just a little bit less. This is because the first place where water and air come in contact with the soil is at the top. As water moves down through the layers, it is able to do less work to change the soil. If you were able to dig a deep hole into the ground, you could see each of the different layers of soil. All together, these are called a '''soil profile'''. Each
horizon has its own particular set of characteristics (Figure 9.8).

[[File:Stagnogley.JPG|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 9.8''': Each soil horizon is distinctly visible in this photograph.]]
[[File:Soil profile.png|right|frame|'''Figure 9.9''': A soil profile is the complete set of soil layers. Each layer is called a horizon.]]

In the simplest soil profile, a soil is considered to have three horizons. The first horizon is the '''top soil''', which is called the ''A horizon''. The topsoil will usually be the darkest layer of the soil, because this is the layer with the highest proportion of organic material. Remember that humus forms from all the plant and animal debris that falls to the ground. This includes branches and twigs, acorns and pine needles as well as waste from animals and fungi. The top soil is the region of most intense biological activity. Many living organisms live within this layer and plants stretch their roots down into this layer. In fact, plant roots are very important to this layer because vegetation helps to hold this layer of soil in place. The top soil layer is usually a layer where minerals that can dissolve and very small particles like clay are absent. This is because clay sized particles get carried to lower layers as water seeps down into the ground. Soluble minerals are missing because they readily dissolve in the fresh water that moves through this layer and are carried down to lower layers of the soil.

The next soil horizon is the '''subsoil''', which is called the ''B horizon''. This is the region where soluble minerals and clays accumulate. This layer will be lighter brown in color and more water holding than the top soil, due to the presence of iron and clay minerals. There will be less organic material in this layer. The next layer down, called the ''C horizon'' will be a layer of partially altered bedrock. There will be some evidence of weathering in this layer, but pieces of the original rock can still be seen and it would be possible to identify the original type of rock from which this soil formed (Figure 9.9).

Not all climate regions develop soils, and not all regions develop the same horizons. Some areas develop as many as five or six distinct layers, while others develop only very thin soils or perhaps soil doesn't form well at all.

==Types of Soils==
If we were to talk to soil scientists, you would learn that there are thousands of types of soil. Soil scientists study each of the many different characteristics of each soil and put them into very specific groups and have many different names for soils. Let's consider a much simpler model that considers just three types of soil. This will help you to understand some of the basic ideas about how the particular climate of an area produces a certain type of soil, but there are many exceptions to what we will learn right now.

Let's consider the type of soil that would form in a region of the world where there are forests of trees that lose their leaves each winter, called '''deciduous trees'''. In order for trees to grow here, there needs to be lots of rain, at least 65 cm of rainfall per year. Wherever there are trees, there is enough rain to help them grow! The type of soil that forms in a forested area is called a '''pedalfer''' and this type of soil is common in many areas of the temperate, eastern part of the United States (Figure 9.10). The word pedalfer comes from some of the elements that are commonly found in the soil. The element aluminum has the chemical symbol Al and the element iron has the chemical symbol Fe. These two symbols are combined '-al' and '-fe' to make the word ped ''–al –fe r''. This type of soil is usually a very fertile, dark brown or black soil. It is rich in aluminum clays and iron oxides. Because it rains often in this type of climate, most of the soluble minerals dissolve and are carried away, leaving the less soluble clays and iron oxides behind.

[[File:Forest_Osaka_Japan.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 9.10''': A pedalfer is the dark, fertile type of soil that will form in a forested region.]]

Another type of climate related soil, called a '''pedocal''', forms in drier temperate areas where grasslands and brush are the usual types of vegetation (Figure 9.11). It rains less than 65 cm per year in these areas, so there is less chemical weathering for these soils. With lower amounts of rainfall, there is less water to dissolve away soluble minerals, so more soluble minerals are present here but fewer clay minerals are produced. With lower rainfall, there is also less vegetation here, so the soils have lower amounts of organic material, making them slightly less fertile types of soils than a pedalfer. A pedo''cal'' is named for the calcite enriched layer that forms. Some water begins to move down through the soil layers, but before it gets very far, it begins to evaporate away. Soluble minerals, like calcium carbonate, concentrate in a layer that marks the lowest place that water was able to reach before it evaporated away. This layer is called caliche.

[[File:Konza1.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 9.11''': A pedocal is the alkaline type of soil that forms in grassland regions.]]
[[File:Daintree Rainforest.JPG|250px|thumb|'''Figure 9.12''': A laterite is the type of thick, nutrient poor soil that forms in the rainforest.]]

A third type of soil called a '''laterite''' forms in tropical areas, where rainfall is so intense that it literally rains every day. The tropical rainforest is an example of this type of region (Figure 9.12). In these hot, wet tropical regions nutrient poor soils form due to intense chemical weathering. So much weathering happens here that there is practically no humus. All soluble minerals are removed from the soil and all plant nutrients get leached or carried away. What are left behind are the least soluble materials like aluminum and iron oxides. These soils are often red in color from the iron oxides. These soils bake as hard as a brick if they are set out in the sun to dry.

You can probably very quickly name many climates that have not been mentioned here. Each climate will produce a distinctive soil that forms in the particular circumstances found there. Where there is less weathering, soils are thinner but soluble minerals may be present. Where there is intense weathering, soils may be thick but nutrient poor. In any case, soil development takes a very long time. It may take hundreds or even thousands of years to form a good fertile top soil. Soil scientists estimate that in the very best soil forming conditions, soil forms at a rate of about 1mm/year. In poor conditions it may take thousands of years!

==Soil Conservation==
[[File:Compost_Heap.jpg|250px|thumb|'''Figure 9.13''': Organic material can be added to soil to help increase its fertility.]]

Soil is only a renewable resource if we carefully manage the ways in which we use soil. There are natural cycles of unfortunate events like drought or insect plagues or outbreaks of disease that negatively impact ecosystems and also harm the soil. But there are also many ways in which humans neglect or abuse this important resource. One harmful practice is removing the vegetation that helps to hold soil in place. Sometimes just walking or riding your bike over the same place, will kill the grass that normally grows there. Other times land is deliberately cleared to make way for some other use. The 'lost' soils may be carried away by wind or running water. In many areas of the world, the rate of soil erosion is many times greater than the rate at which it is forming. Soils can also be contaminated if too much salt accumulates in the soil or where pollutants sink into the ground.

There are many ways that we can protect and preserve our precious resources of soil. There are many ways to help to keep soil in good condition. Adding organic material to the soil in the form of plant or animal waste, like manure or compost, increases the fertility of the soil as well as improving its ability to hold onto water and nutrients (Figure 9.13). Inorganic fertilizer can also temporarily increase the fertility of a soil and may be less expensive or time consuming, but won’t provide the same long term improvements as organic materials. Agricultural practices like rotating crops, alternating the types of crops planted in each row 
and planting nutrient rich cover crops all help to keep soil more fertile as it is used season after season. Planting trees as windbreaks, plowing along contours of the field or building terraces into steeper slopes will all help to hold soil in place (Figure 9.14). No till or low tillage farming helps to keep soil in place by disturbing the ground as little as possible when planting.

==Lesson Summary==
* Soil is an important resource. Life on Earth could not exist as it does today without soil.
* The type of soil that forms depends mostly on climate but to a lesser extent on original parent rock material.
* Soil texture and composition plus the amount of organic material in a soil determine a soil's qualities and fertility.
* Given enough time, existing rock will produce layers within the soil, called a soil profile.
* Ultimately, the climate of a particular region will produce a unique type of soil for that climate.

==Review Questions==
# Describe at least two ways in which soil is a living resource.
# Name two factors that influence soil formation.
# Which region of a soil profiles reacts the most?
# Is the soil in your back yard most likely a residual soil or a transported soil? How could you check?
# Name several advantages to adding humus to the soil.
# What are three soil horizons? Describe the characteristics of each.
# Name three climate related soils. Describe the climate and vegetation that occurs in the area where each forms.
# Where would you choose to buy land for a farm if you wanted fertile soil and did not want to have to irrigate your crops?

==Points to Consider==
* Why is soil such an important resource?
* Do you think a mature soil would form faster from unaltered bedrock or from transported materials?
* If soil erosion is happening at a greater rate than new soil can form, what will eventually happen to the soil in that region?
* Do you think there are pollutants that could not easily be removed from soil?

This is not an elementary arithmetic book; the suggestion to move to Foundations of Mathematics is correct.  However, this book is too broad in scope for the topics it wishes to cover and is not very complete to boot.  Two chapters on set theory and number theory are already covered by [[Set Theory]] and [[Number Theory]].  Two other chapters listed on geometry and algebra are covered by [[Geometry]] and [[Algebra]].  The remaining chapters have barely any content worth mentioning.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:52, 16 May 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' The first few pages ([[Beginning Mathematics/What is Mathematics?]], [[Beginning Mathematics/Where To Start? With Nothing!]], etc.) suggest that once upon a time there were really beautiful plans for this book, namely, an introduction to mathematical logic and abstraction for the layman/non-mathematician. Unfortunately, it never really blossomed - not only due to lack of development but also because it kind of loses the plot by the time it starts overlapping with [[Set Theory]] and the other books Adrignola mentioned. I also agree on the inadequacy of the book title. Nevertheless, I can see a point in this book, and in fact I wish I had deeper knowledge of Formal Mathematics in order to contribute to such a project. I lean very strongly towards a keep - but seeing that we have [[User:Thenub314|a mathematician]] on board it will be useful to have his opinion on the viability of the book to balance my &quot;emotional&quot; comment. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 00:07, 17 May 2010 (UTC)
:I agree with Duplode here. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 11:03, 17 May 2010 (UTC)
::{{Comment}}  Forgive the slow reply, but since my professional opinion was being asked, I wanted to consider things carefully.  I am not in expert in mathematical logic nor mathematical philosophy, which are really what the first few pages are about.  That being said, I have never encountered the type of definitions being given here.  Googling around fails to turn up anywhere else that defines object or variable in this way.  In serious mathematics books it is not unheard of to set out your own definitions, so maybe this isn't really an issue.  Unfortunately it means that it would be very difficult for anyone other then the original author to continue from where the book has currently left off without major work.
::There are also a few odd choices the author makes that are a bit unusual for this type of book.  For example, the section on Number theory... what is written so far attempts to define what the whole numbers are, but somehow it is a rather vauge and &quot;hand wavy&quot;., and based on a very antiquated system of defining the numbers.  One usually expects to see something like the set-theortic definition used by ZFC, or Peano's Axioms.  But this seems to go further back to Frege and Russel.  But it is done without care, so instead of defining the numbers to be sets, (or equivalence classes of sets), they are defined to be the number of elements in a set, which is hopelessly circular.  But as is pointed out above, by the time any actual mathematics is reached, the book has lost its way.  
:: Overall, the executive summary of my opinion is this: A book developing mathematic logic, philosophy, and content side by side is a nice idea.  But because of the unorthodox point of view about on these subjects, I am not sure anyone else could continue this book.  Trying to move the book to a more orthodox point of view would require rewriting everything more or less from scratch.

:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' There seems not to be any special characteristic of this book that makes the content discardable. Even agreeing with some of the remarks above, I don't feel that the &quot;quality&quot; analysis in this case makes the content deletable. For instance one of the many book ideas that have crossed my mind is a book in the lines of the BBC documentary &quot;The Story of Maths&quot;, having this type of material around is useful, even if by itself it will never get completed as a book it is a valid resource and has been the result of well intentioned contributions, this is why we preserve stubs, all works here are mutable. If the reasons presented above had been about duplication of content then I would support the deletion...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:23, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

::{{comment}} My analysis above was not so much about quality.  The point was about perspective, I will try to make clear how.  If your writing a book in which your developing mathematics from its foundations the definitions shape the rest of the book.  Since everything basically comes back to definitions in the study of the foundations of mathematics. In the case of this book, the definitions are unique.  This of course runs into OR concerns, but putting those aside for a moment, no one other then the original author will be able to develop this book further with those definitions.  Changing the definitions amounts to rewriting the book, since its whole point is to start with nothing and describe how everything is built up.  

::Let me take the example of a variable, whose definition is give to be &quot;a Symbol which represents a property of some object.&quot;  This is contrary to the usual interpretation that a variable represents an object.  So if I said &quot;Find all numbers ''x'' so that ''x'' + 2 = 5&quot;, I am in a tricky position.  Here the symbol ''x'' is not a variable, it is a letter that represents an object, not a ''property'' of an object. So when someone later came and added a section on algebra, they didn't (perhaps coundn't) write the section in a way that fit in with this books point of view about logic and mathematics.  The book, to quote [[User:Duplode|Duplode]],  &quot;kind of loses the plot&quot;, but it is not at all clear where the book was going because of its very unorthodox and unique point of view.  Which is why I feel that overall it is not at all plausible to believe someone could develop this book further without rewriting it entirely.  Nothing is gained by keeping these pages here. A book along the lines of [[w:The Story of Maths|The Story of Maths]] would be wonderful, but there is nothing in this book that would be helpful in such an endeavor.  (It contains no correct historical account of the development of mathematics, not does it develop it's mathematics in any historically order.)

[[File:Electromagnetic-Spectrum.png|thumb|290px|right|X-rays are part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].]]
'''X-radiation''' (composed of '''X-rays''') is a form of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. X-rays have a [[wavelength]] in the range of 0.01 to 10 [[nanometer]]s, corresponding to [[frequency|frequencies]] in the range 30 [[Hertz|petahertz]] to 30 [[Hertz|exahertz]] (3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; Hz to 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; Hz) and energies in the range 120 [[Electronvolt|eV]] to 120 [[keV]]. They are shorter in wavelength than [[UV]] rays and longer than [[gamma ray]]s. In many languages, X-radiation is called '''Röntgen radiation''', after  [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]], who is generally credited as their discoverer, and who had named them X-rays to signify an unknown type of radiation.&lt;ref name=&quot;squires&quot;&gt;Novelline, Robert. ''Squire's Fundamentals of Radiology''. Harvard University Press. 5th edition. 1997. ISBN 0674833392.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|1-2|date=May 2009}}

X-rays from about 0.12 to 12 keV (10 to 0.10&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength) are classified as &quot;soft&quot; X-rays, and from about 12 to 120 keV (0.01 to 0.10&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength) as &quot;hard&quot; X-rays, due to their penetrating abilities.

Hard X-rays can penetrate solid objects, and their largest use is to take images of the inside of objects in [[Diagnosis (medical)|diagnostic]] [[radiography]] and [[X-ray crystallography|crystallography]]. As a result, the term ''X-ray'' is [[metonomy|metonymically]] used to refer to a radiographic image produced using this method, in addition to the method itself.  By contrast, soft X-rays can hardly be said to penetrate matter at all; for instance, the attenuation length of 600 eV (~ 2&amp;nbsp;nm) x-rays in water is less than 1 micrometer.&lt;sup&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/ffast/ffast.pl?Formula=H2O&amp;gtype=5&amp;range=S&amp;lower=0.300&amp;upper=2.00&amp;density=1.00]&lt;/sup&gt;  X-rays are a form of [[ionizing radiation]], and exposure to them can be a health hazard.

The distinction between X-rays and [[gamma ray]]s has changed in recent decades. Originally, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by [[X-ray tube]]s had a longer [[wavelength]] than the radiation emitted by [[radioactive]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] (gamma rays).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dendy&quot;&gt;{{cite book

However, as shorter wavelength continuous spectrum &quot;X-ray&quot; sources such as [[linear accelerator]]s and longer wavelength &quot;gamma ray&quot; emitters were discovered, the wavelength bands largely overlapped.  The two types of radiation are now usually distinguished by their origin: X-rays are emitted by electrons outside the nucleus, while gamma rays are emitted by the [[nucleus (atomic structure)|nucleus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dendy&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Units of measure and exposure==
The measure of X-rays [[ionization|ionizing]] ability is called the exposure:
*The [[coulomb]] per [[kilogram]] (C/kg) is the [[Systeme International|SI]] unit of [[ionizing radiation]] exposure, and it is the amount of radiation required to create one coulomb of charge of each polarity in one kilogram of matter.
*The [[roentgen]] (R) is an obsolete traditional unit of exposure, which represented the amount of radiation required  to create one [[electrostatic unit]] of charge of each polarity in one cubic centimeter of dry air.  1.00 roentgen = 2.58×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; C/kg

However, the effect of ionizing  radiation on matter (especially living tissue) is more closely related to the amount of [[energy]] deposited into them rather than the [[electric charge|charge generated]]. This measure of energy absorbed is called the [[absorbed dose]]:
*The [[gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy), which has units of (Joules/kilogram), is the SI unit of [[absorbed dose]], and it is the amount of radiation required to deposit one [[joule]] of energy in one [[kilogram]] of any kind of matter.
*The [[rad (unit)|rad]] is the (obsolete) corresponding traditional unit, equal to 10 millijoules of energy deposited per kilogram.  100 rad = 1.00 gray.

The [[equivalent dose]] is the measure of the biological effect of radiation on human tissue. For X-rays it is equal to the [[absorbed dose]].
*The [[sievert]] (Sv) is the SI unit of equivalent dose, which for X-rays is numerically equal to the [[Gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy).
*The [[Roentgen equivalent man]] (rem) is the traditional unit of equivalent dose. For X-rays it is equal to the [[rad]] or 10 millijoules of energy deposited per kilogram.  1.00 Sv = 100 rem.

Medical X-rays are a significant source of ''manmade'' radiation exposure, accounting for 58% in the [[United States]] in 1987, but since most radiation exposure is natural (82%), medical X-rays only account for 10% of ''total'' American radiation exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Reported dosage due to dental X-rays seems to vary significantly.

X-rays are generated by an [[X-ray tube]], a [[vacuum tube]] that uses a high voltage to accelerate the [[electron]]s released by a [[hot cathode]] to a high velocity.  The high velocity electrons collide with a metal target, the [[anode]], creating the X-rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In crystallography, a [[copper]] target is most common, with [[cobalt]] often being used when fluorescence from [[iron]] content in the sample might otherwise present a problem.

The maximum energy of the produced X-ray [[photon]] is limited by the energy of the incident electron, which is equal to the voltage on the tube, so an 80&amp;nbsp;kV tube cannot create X-rays with an energy greater than 80&amp;nbsp;keV.  When the electrons hit the target, X-rays are created by two different atomic processes:
#[[X-ray fluorescence]]: If the electron has enough energy it can knock an orbital electron out of the inner [[electron shell]] of a metal atom, and as a result electrons from higher energy levels then fill up the vacancy and X-ray photons are emitted. This process produces an [[emission spectrum]] of X-ray frequencies, sometimes referred to as the spectral lines.  The spectral lines generated depend on the target (anode) element used and thus are called characteristic lines. Usually these are transitions from upper shells into K shell (called [[K-alpha|K lines]]), into L shell (called L lines) and so on.
#''[[Bremsstrahlung]]'': This is radiation given off by the electrons as they are scattered by the strong electric field near the high-''Z'' ([[proton]] number) nuclei.  These X-rays have a [[continuous spectrum]].  The intensity of the X-rays increases linearly with decreasing frequency, from zero at the energy of the incident electrons, the voltage on the [[X-ray tube]].
So the resulting output of a tube consists of a continuous bremsstrahlung spectrum falling off to zero at the tube voltage, plus several spikes at the characteristic lines.  The voltages used in diagnostic X-ray tubes, and thus the highest energies of the X-rays, range from roughly 20 to 150 kV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In medical diagnostic applications, the low energy (soft) X-rays are unwanted, since they are totally absorbed by the body, increasing the dose. Hence, a thin metal sheet, often of aluminum, called an [[X-Ray filters|X-ray filter]]) is usually placed over the window of the X-ray tube, filtering out the low energy components in the spectrum. This is called ''hardening'' the beam.&lt;!-- This is redundant; it's present in the introduction: Very hard X-rays overlap with the range of &quot;long&quot;-wavelength (lower energy) [[gamma ray]]s, however the distinction between the two terms in medicine depends on the source of the radiation, not its wavelength. X-ray [[photon]]s are generated by energetic electron processes, whereas gamma rays by transitions within [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} --&gt;

Both of these X-ray production processes are very inefficient, with a production efficiency of only about one percent, and hence, to produce a usable flux of X-rays, a high percentage of the [[electric power]] inputted is released as waste heat. The X-ray tube must be designed to dissipate this excess heat.

[[Radiograph]]s obtained using X-rays can be used to identify a wide spectrum of pathologies. Because the body structures being imaged in medical applications are large compared to the wavelength of the X-rays, the X-rays can be analyzed as particles rather than waves. (This is in contrast to [[X-ray crystallography]], where their wave-like nature is more important because the wavelength is comparable to the sizes of the structures being imaged.)

To make an X-ray image of human or animal bones, short X-ray pulses illuminate the body or limb, with radiographic film placed behind it. Any bones that are present  absorb most of the X-ray photons by [[photoelectric]] processes. This is because bones have a higher electron density than soft tissues. [Note that bones contain a high percentage of calcium (20 electrons per atom), potassium (19 electrons per atom) magnesium (12 electrons per atom), and phosphorus (15 electrons per atom). The X-rays that pass through the flesh leave a latent image in the [[photographic film]]. When the film is developed, the parts of the image corresponding to higher X-ray exposure are dark, leaving a white shadow of bones on the film.

To generate an image of the cardiovascular system, including the arteries and veins ([[angiography]]) an initial image is taken of the anatomical region of interest. A second image is then taken of the same region after iodinated contrast material has been injected into the blood vessels within this area. These two images are then digitally subtracted, leaving an image of only the iodinated contrast outlining the blood vessels. The radiologist or surgeon then compares the image obtained to normal anatomical images to determine if there is any damage or blockage of the vessel.

A specialized source of X-rays which is becoming widely used in research is [[synchrotron radiation]], which is generated by [[particle accelerator]]s. Its unique features are X-ray outputs many orders of magnitude greater than those of X-ray tubes, wide X-ray spectra, excellent [[collimation]], and [[linear polarization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

==Detectors==
===Photographic plate===
The detection of X-rays is based on various methods. The most commonly known methods are [[photographic plate]]s, [[photographic film]] in cassettes, and [[rare earth element|rare earth]] screens. Regardless of what is &quot;catching&quot; the image, they are all categorized as &quot;Image Receptors&quot; (IR).

Before the advent of the [[digital computer]] and before the invention of digital imaging, [[photographic plate]]s were used to produce most radiographic images. The images were produced right on the glass plates. Photographic film largely replaced these plates, and it was used in X-ray laboratories to produce medical images. In more recent years, computerized and digital radiography has been replacing photographic film in medical and dental applications, though film technology remains in widespread use in industrial radiography processes (e.g. to inspect welded seams). Photographic plates are mostly things of history, and their replacement, the &quot;intensifying screen&quot;, is also fading into history. The metal [[silver (element)|silver]] (formerly necessary to the radiographic &amp; photographic industries) is a non-renewable resource. Thus it is beneficial that this is now being replaced by digital (DR) and computed (CR) technology. Where photographic  films required wet processing facilities, these new technologies do not. The digital archiving of images utilizing these new technologies also saves storage space.

Since photographic plates are sensitive to X-rays, they provide a means of recording the image, but they also required much X-ray exposure (to the patient), hence intensifying screens were devised. They allow a lower dose to the patient, because the screens take the X-ray information and intensify it so that it can be recorded on film positioned next to the intensifying screen.

The part of the patient to be X-rayed is placed between the X-ray source and the image receptor to produce a shadow of the internal structure of that particular part of the body. X-rays are partially blocked (&quot;attenuated&quot;) by dense tissues such as bone, and pass more easily through soft tissues. Areas where the X-rays strike darken when developed, causing bones to appear lighter than the surrounding soft tissue.

Contrast compounds containing [[barium]] or [[iodine]], which are [[radiopaque]], can be ingested in the gastrointestinal tract (barium) or injected in the artery or veins to highlight these vessels.  The contrast compounds have high atomic numbered elements in them that (like bone) essentially block the X-rays and hence the once hollow organ or vessel can be more readily seen. In the pursuit of a non-toxic contrast material, many types of high atomic number elements were evaluated. For example, the first time the forefathers used contrast it was chalk, and was used on a cadaver's vessels. Unfortunately, some elements chosen proved to be harmful&amp;nbsp;– for example,  [[thorium]] was once used as a contrast medium ([[Thorotrast]])&amp;nbsp;– which turned out to be toxic in some cases (causing injury and occasionally death from the effects of thorium poisoning). Modern contrast material has improved, and while there is no way to determine who may have a sensitivity to the contrast, the incidence of &quot;allergic-type reactions&quot; are low. (The risk is comparable to that associated with penicillin.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}})

===Photostimulable phosphors (PSPs)===
An increasingly common method is the use of [[photostimulated luminescence]] (PSL), pioneered by Fuji in the 1980s. In modern hospitals a [[photostimulable phosphor plate]] (PSP plate) is used in place of the photographic plate. After the plate is X-rayed, excited electrons in the phosphor material remain &quot;trapped&quot; in &quot;colour centres&quot; in the crystal lattice until stimulated by a laser beam passed over the plate surface. The [[light]] given off during laser stimulation is collected by a [[Photomultiplier|photomultiplier tube]] and the resulting signal is converted into a digital image by computer technology, which gives this process its common name, [[computed radiography]] (also referred to as '''digital radiography'''). The PSP plate can be reused, and existing X-ray equipment requires no modification to use them.

===Geiger counter===
Initially, most common detection methods were based on the [[plasma (physics)|ionization of gases]], as in the [[Geiger counter|Geiger-Müller counter]]: a sealed volume, usually a cylinder, with a mica, polymer or thin metal window contains a gas, a cylindrical [[cathode]] and a wire [[anode]]; a high voltage is applied between the cathode and the anode. When an X-ray photon enters the cylinder, it ionizes the gas and forms ions and electrons. Electrons accelerate toward the anode, in the process causing further ionization along their trajectory. This process, known as a [[Townsend avalanche]], is detected as a sudden current, called a &quot;count&quot; or &quot;event&quot;.

In order to gain energy spectrum information, a [[diffraction|diffracting]] crystal may be used to first separate the different photons. The method is called [[wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] ([[WDX]] or WDS). Position-sensitive detectors are often used in conjunction with dispersive elements. Other detection equipment that is inherently energy-resolving may be used, such as the aforementioned [[proportional counter]]s. In either case, use of suitable pulse-processing (MCA) equipment allows digital spectra to be created for later analysis.

For many applications, counters are not sealed but are constantly fed with purified gas, thus reducing problems of contamination or gas aging. These are called &quot;flow counters&quot;.

===Scintillators===
Some materials such as [[sodium iodide]] (NaI) can &quot;convert&quot; an X-ray photon to a visible photon; an electronic detector can be built by adding a [[photomultiplier]]. These detectors are called &quot;[[scintillator]]s&quot;, filmscreens or &quot;[[scintillation counter]]s&quot;. The main advantage of using these is that an adequate image can be obtained while subjecting the patient to a much lower dose of X-rays.

===Image intensification===
[[File:Laprascopy-Roentgen.jpg|right|thumb|250px|X-ray during [[cholecystectomy]]]]
X-rays are also used in &quot;real-time&quot; procedures such as [[angiography]] or contrast studies of the hollow organs (e.g. [[barium enema]] of the small or large intestine) using [[fluoroscopy]] acquired using an [[X-ray image intensifier]]. [[Angioplasty]], medical interventions of the arterial system, rely heavily on X-ray-sensitive contrast to identify potentially treatable lesions.

===Direct semiconductor detectors===
Since the 1970s, new [[semiconductor detector]]s have been developed ([[silicon]] or [[germanium]] doped with [[lithium]], Si(Li) or Ge(Li)). X-ray photons are converted to electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor and are collected to detect the X-rays. When the temperature is low enough (the detector is cooled by [[Peltier effect]] or even cooler [[liquid nitrogen]]), it is possible to directly determine the X-ray energy spectrum; this method is called [[energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (EDX or EDS); it is often used in small [[X-ray fluorescence]] [[spectroscopy|spectrometers]]. These detectors are sometimes called &quot;[[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] detectors&quot;. Detectors based on [[cadmium telluride]] ([[cadmium|Cd]]Te) and its alloy with [[zinc]], [[cadmium zinc telluride]], have an increased sensitivity, which allows lower doses of X-rays to be used.

Practical application in [[medical imaging]] started in the 1990s. Currently amorphous [[selenium]] is used in commercial large area flat panel X-ray detectors for [[mammography]] and chest [[radiography]]. Current research and development is focused around pixel detectors, such as [[CERN]]'s energy resolving [[Medipix]] detector.

Note: A standard [[semiconductor]] [[diode]], such as a 1N4007, will produce a small amount of current when placed in an X-ray beam. A test device once used by Medical Imaging Service personnel was a small project box that contained several diodes of this type in [[series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]], which could be connected to an [[oscilloscope]] as a quick diagnostic.

[[Silicon drift detector]]s (SDDs), produced by conventional [[semiconductor fabrication]], now provide a cost-effective and high resolving power radiation measurement. Unlike conventional X-ray detectors, such as Si(Li)s, they do not need to be cooled with liquid nitrogen.

===Scintillator plus semiconductor detectors (indirect detection)===
With the advent of large semiconductor array detectors it has become possible to design detector systems using a scintillator screen to convert from X-rays to visible light which is then converted to electrical signals in an array detector.  Indirect [[Flat panel detectors|Flat Panel Detectors]] (FPDs) are in widespread use today in medical, dental, veterinary and industrial applications. &lt;!-- This looks redundant too: A common form of these detectors is based on [[amorphous silicon]] [[Thin film transistor|TFT]]/[[photodiode]] arrays. --&gt;

The array technology is a variant on the amorphous silicon TFT arrays used in many [[flat panel display]]s, like the ones in computer laptops. The array consists of a sheet of glass covered with a thin layer of silicon that is in an amorphous or disordered state. At a microscopic scale, the silicon has been imprinted with millions of transistors arranged in a highly ordered array, like the grid on a sheet of graph paper. Each of these [[thin film transistor]]s (TFTs) is attached to a light-absorbing photodiode making up an individual [[pixel]] (picture element).  Photons striking the photodiode are converted into two [[charge carrier|carriers of electrical charge]], called electron-hole pairs.  Since the number of charge carriers produced will vary with the intensity of incoming light photons, an electrical pattern is created that can be swiftly converted to a voltage and then a digital signal, which is interpreted by a computer to produce a digital image.  Although silicon has outstanding electronic properties, it is not a particularly good absorber of X-ray photons. For this reason, X-rays first impinge upon [[scintillator]]s made from e.g. [[gadolinium oxysulfide]] or [[caesium iodide]]. The scintillator absorbs the X-rays and converts them into visible light photons that then pass onto the photodiode array.

===Visibility to the human eye===
While generally considered invisible to the human eye, in special circumstances X-rays can be visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

When placing an X-ray tube on the opposite side of a wooden door Röntgen had noted the same blue glow, seeming to emanate from the eye itself, but thought his observations to be spurious because he only saw the effect when he used one type of tube. Later he realized that the tube which had created the effect was the only one powerful enough to make the glow plainly visible and the [[experiment]] was thereafter readily repeatable. The knowledge that X-rays are actually faintly visible to the dark-adapted naked eye has largely been forgotten today; this is probably due to the desire not to repeat what would now be seen as a recklessly dangerous and potentially harmful experiment with [[ionizing radiation]]. It is not known what exact mechanism in the eye produces the visibility: it could be due to conventional detection (excitation of [[rhodopsin]] molecules in the retina), direct excitation of retinal nerve cells, or secondary detection via, for instance, X-ray induction of [[phosphorescence]] in the eyeball with conventional retinal detection of the secondarily produced visible light.

Though X-rays are otherwise invisible it is possible to see the [[ionization]] of the air molecules if the intensity of the X-ray beam is high enough. The beamline from the [[Wiggler (synchrotron)|wiggler]] at the [http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/Experiments/MaterialsScience/faisceau ID11] at [[ESRF]] is one example of such high intensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book

==Medical uses==

Since Röntgen's discovery that X-rays can identify bone structures, X-rays have been developed for their use in [[medical imaging]], the first use was less than a month after his seminal paper on the subject.&lt;ref name = PKS/&gt; [[Radiology]] is a specialized field of [[medicine]]. Radiologists employ [[radiography]] and other techniques for [[diagnostic imaging]]. This is probably the most common use of X-ray technology.

X-rays are especially useful in the detection of pathology of the [[bone|skeletal system]], but are also useful for detecting some disease processes in [[soft tissue]]. Some notable examples are the very common [[chest X-ray]], which can be used to identify lung diseases such as [[pneumonia]], [[lung cancer]] or [[pulmonary edema]], and the [[abdominal X-ray]], which can detect [[intestine|intestinal]] obstruction, free air (from visceral perforations) and free fluid (in [[ascites]]). X-rays may also be used to detect pathology such as [[gallstone]]s (which are rarely [[radiopaque]]) or [[kidney stone]]s which are often (but not always) visible. Traditional plain X-rays are less useful in the imaging of soft tissues such as the [[brain]] or [[muscle]]. Imaging alternatives for soft tissues are [[computed axial tomography]] (CAT or CT scanning),&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) or [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]]. The latter two do not subject the individual to ionizing radiation. In addition to plain X-rays and CT scans, physicians use fluoroscopy as an X-ray test methodology. This method often uses administration of a medical contrast material ([[intravenous]]ly, [[oral]]ly or via [[enema]]). Examples include cardiac catheterization (to examine for [[coronary artery]] blockages) and Barium swallow (to examine for [[esophageal]] disorders.

Since 2005, X-rays are listed as a [[carcinogen]] by the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/toc11.html 11th Report on Carcinogens&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of X-rays as a treatment is known as [[radiotherapy]] and is largely used for the management (including [[palliation]]) of [[cancer]]; it requires higher radiation energies than for imaging alone.

==Risks of Medical Diagnostic X-rays==

[[Image:preg xray.jpg|thumb|right|250px| X-Ray of a pregnant woman.]]

X-rays are a relatively safe method of investigation and the radiation exposure is relatively low, depending upon the study. Experimental and epidemiological data, however, do not support the proposition that there is a threshold dose of radiation below which there is no increased risk of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Upton AC (2003).The state of the art in the 1990s: NCRP report No. 136 on the scientific bases for linearity in the dose-response relationship for ionizing radiation. ''Health Physics'' 85:15-22&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnostic X-rays account for 14% of the total annual radiation exposure from man-made and natural sources worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation. New York. United Nations, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that the additional radiation will increase a person's cumulative risk of getting cancer by age 75 by 0.6-1.8%.&lt;ref&gt;Berrington de Gonzalez A and Darby S (2004). Risk of cancer from diagnostic X-rays: estimates for the UK and 14 other countries. ''Lancet'' 363: 345-351&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of absorbed radiation depends upon the type of X-ray test and the body part involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brenner 2007&quot;&gt;Brenner DJ and Hall EJ (2007). Computed tomography- an increasing source of radiation exposure. ''New England Journal of Medicine'' 357: 2277-2284&lt;/ref&gt; CT and fluoroscopy entail higher doses of radiation than do plain X-rays.

To place the increased risk in perspective, a plain chest X-ray or dental X-ray will expose a person to the same amount from [[background radiation]] that we are exposed to (depending upon location) everyday over 10 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACR&quot;&gt;[http://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/safety/index.cfm?pg=sfty_xray]|Radiological Society of North America and American College of Radiology&lt;/ref&gt; Each such X-ray would add less than 1 per 1,000,000 to the lifetime cancer risk. An abdominal or chest CT would be the equivalent to 2–3 years of background radiation, increasing the lifetime cancer risk between 1 per 10,000 and 1 per 1,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACR&quot;/&gt; These numbers are very small compared to the roughly 40% chance of developing any cancer during our lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2006/browse_csr.php?section=2&amp;page=sect_02_table.11.html#table1]|National Cancer Institute: Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data&lt;/ref&gt;

Fathers exposed to diagnostic x-rays are more likely to have infants who contract leukemia, especially if exposure is closer to conception or includes two or more X-rays of the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract or lower abdomen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xiao-Ou|first=Shu|coauthors=et al|date=December 1994|title=Association of paternal diagnostic X-ray exposure with risk of infant leukemia|journal=Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention|publisher=American Association for Cancer Research|volume=3|page=645|issn=1538-7755|pmid=7881337|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7881337|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The risk of radiation is greater to unborn babies, so in pregnant patients, the benefits of the investigation (X-ray) should be balanced with the potential hazards to the unborn fetus.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Alice M; J.W.

==Shielding against X-Rays==

[[Lead]] is the most common shield against X-rays because of its high density (11340&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), stopping power, ease of installation and low cost.  The maximum range of a high-energy photon such as an X-ray in matter is infinite; at every point in the matter traversed by the photon, there is a probability of interaction.  Thus there is a very small probability of no interaction over very large distances.  The shielding of photon beam is therefore exponential (with an [[attenuation length]] being close to the [[radiation length]] of the material); doubling the thickness of shielding will square the shielding effect.

The following table shows the recommended thickness of lead shielding in function of X-ray energy, from the Recommendations by the Second International Congress of Radiology.&lt;ref&gt;Alchemy Art Lead Products – [http://www.alchemycastings.com/pdf/SheetLead.pdf Lead Shielding Sheet Lead For Shielding Applications], retrieved 2008-12-07&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Discovery===
German physicist [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] is usually credited as the discoverer of X-rays because he was the first to systematically study them, though he is not the first to have observed their effects.  He is also the one who gave them the name &quot;X-rays&quot;, though many referred to these as &quot;Röntgen rays&quot; for several decades after their discovery.

X-rays were found emanating from [[Crookes tube]]s, experimental [[discharge tube]]s invented around 1875, by scientists investigating the [[cathode ray]]s, that is energetic [[electron]] beams, that were first created in the tubes.  Crookes tubes created free electrons by [[ionization]] of the residual air in the tube by a high DC [[voltage]] of anywhere between a few [[kilovolt]]s and 100 kV.  This voltage accelerated the electrons coming from the [[cathode]] to a high enough velocity that they created X-rays when they struck the [[anode]] or the glass wall of the tube.  Many of the early Crookes tubes undoubtedly radiated X-rays, because early researchers noticed effects that were attributable to them, as detailed below.  Wilhelm Röntgen was the first to systematically study them, in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;The history, development, and impact of computed imaging in neurological diagnosis and neurosurgery: CT, MRI, DTI: [http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3267/version/5 Nature Precedings DOI: 10.1038/npre.2009.3267.5].&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the important early researchers in X-rays were [[Ivan Pulyui]], [[William Crookes]], [[Johann Wilhelm Hittorf]], [[Eugen Goldstein]], [[Heinrich Hertz]], [[Philipp Lenard]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Charles Glover Barkla]], [[Max von Laue]], and [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]].

====Johann Hittorf====
German physicist [[Johann Hittorf]] (1824–1914), a co-inventor and early researcher of the Crookes tube, found when he placed unexposed [[photographic plate]]s near the tube, that some of them were flawed by shadows, though he did not investigate this effect.
{{Clear}}

====Ivan Pulyui====
In 1877 [[Ukrane|Ukrainian]]-born [[Ivan Pulyui|Pulyui]], a lecturer in experimental physics at the [[University of Vienna]], constructed various designs of [[Crookes tube|vacuum discharge tube]] to investigate their properties.&lt;ref name=mayo&gt;{{cite web

Early in 1896, just a few weeks after [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen|Röntgen]] published his first X-ray photograph, Pulyui published high-quality X-ray images in journals in Paris and London.&lt;ref name=mayo/&gt;  Although Pulyui had studied with Röntgen at the [[University of Strasbourg]] in the years 1873–75, his biographer Gaida (1997) asserts that his subsequent research was conducted independently.&lt;ref name=mayo/&gt;

====Nikola Tesla====
In April 1887, [[Nikola Tesla]] began to investigate X-rays using high voltages and tubes of his own design, as well as [[Crookes tube]]s. From his technical publications, it is indicated that he invented and developed a special single-electrode X-ray tube,&lt;ref&gt;Morton, William James, and Edwin W. Hammer, American Technical Book Co., 1896. Page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|514170}}, ''Incandescent Electric Light'', and {{US patent|454622}}, ''System of Electric Lighting''.&lt;/ref&gt; which differed from other X-ray tubes in having no target electrode. The principle behind Tesla's device is called the [[Bremsstrahlung]] process, in which a high-energy secondary X-ray emission is produced when charged particles (such as electrons) pass through matter. By 1892, Tesla performed several such experiments, but he did not categorize the emissions as what were later called X-rays. Tesla generalized the phenomenon as [[radiant energy]] of &quot;invisible&quot; kinds.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Margaret, &quot;[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0743215362 Tesla: Man Out of Time ]&quot;. Simon and Schuster, 2001. Page 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Commerford Martin (ed.), &quot;[http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC04049568 The Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla]&quot;. Page 252 &quot;When it forms a drop, it will emit visible and invisible waves. [...]&quot;. (ed., this material originally appeared in an article by Nikola Tesla in The Electrical Engineer of 1894.)&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla stated the facts of his methods concerning various experiments in his 1897 X-ray lecture before the [[New York Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Nikola Tesla, &quot;The stream of Lenard and Roentgen and novel apparatus for their production&quot;, Apr. 6, 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in this lecture, Tesla stated the method of construction and safe operation of X-ray equipment. His X-ray experimentation by vacuum high field emissions also led him to alert the scientific community to the biological hazards associated with X-ray exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Margaret, Robert Uth, and Jim Glenn, &quot;[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0760710058 Tesla, master of lightning]&quot;. Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing, 1999. Page 76. ISBN 0760710058&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fernando Sanford====
X-rays were generated and detected by [[Fernando Sanford]] (1854–1948), the foundation Professor of Physics at [[Stanford University]], in 1891. From 1886 to 1888 he had studied in the [[Hermann Helmholtz]] laboratory in Berlin, where he became familiar with the cathode rays generated in vacuum tubes when a voltage was applied across separate electrodes, as previously studied by [[Heinrich Hertz]] and [[Philipp Lenard]].  His letter of January 6, 1893 (describing his discovery as &quot;electric photography&quot;) to The [[Physical Review]] was duly published and an article entitled ''Without Lens or Light, Photographs Taken With Plate and Object in Darkness'' appeared in the [[San Francisco Examiner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Wyman|first=Thomas |year=2005 |month= Spring |title=Fernando Sanford and the Discovery of X-rays |journal= &quot;Imprint&quot;, from the Associates of the Stanford University Libraries |volume= |issue= |pages=5–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philipp Lenard====
[[Philipp Lenard]], a student of Heinrich Hertz, wanted to see whether cathode rays could pass out of the Crookes tube into the air.  He built a Crookes tube (later called a &quot;Lenard tube&quot;) with a &quot;window&quot; in the end made of thin aluminum, facing the cathode so the cathode rays would strike it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomson&quot;&gt;{{cite book

He measured the penetrating power of these rays through various materials.  It has been suggested that at least some of these &quot;Lenard rays&quot; were actually X-rays.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 1903, p.185&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Hermann von Helmholtz]] formulated mathematical equations for X-rays. He postulated a dispersion theory before Röntgen made his discovery and announcement. It was formed on the basis of the electromagnetic theory of light.&lt;ref&gt;''Wiedmann's Annalen'', Vol. XLVIII&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he did not work with actual X-rays.

====Wilhelm Röntgen====
On November 8, 1895, [[Germany|German]] physics professor [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] stumbled on X-rays while experimenting with [[Philipp Lenard|Lenard]] and [[Crookes tube]]s and began studying them.  He wrote an initial report &quot;''On a new kind of ray: A preliminary communication''&quot; and on December 28, 1895 submitted it to the [[Würzburg]]'s Physical-Medical Society journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Röntgen referred to the radiation as &quot;X&quot;, to indicate that it was an unknown type of radiation. The name stuck, although (over Röntgen's great objections) many of his colleagues suggested calling them '''Röntgen rays'''. They are still referred to as such in many languages, including German. Röntgen received the first [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his discovery.

There are conflicting accounts of his discovery because Röntgen had his lab notes burned after his death, but this is a likely reconstruction by his biographers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He noticed a faint green glow from the screen, about 1 meter away.  He realized some invisible rays coming from the tube were passing through the cardboard to make the screen glow.  He found they could also pass through books and papers on his desk.  Röntgen threw himself into investigating these unknown rays systematically.  Two months after his initial discovery, he published his paper.

Röntgen discovered its medical use when he saw a picture of his wife's hand on a photographic plate formed due to X-rays. His wife's hand's photograph was the first ever photograph of a human body part using X-rays.

====Thomas Edison====
[[File:Roentgen-Roehre.svg|thumb|Diagram of a water cooled X-ray tube (simplified/outdated)]]
In 1895, [[Thomas Edison]] investigated materials' ability to fluoresce when exposed to X-rays, and found that [[calcium tungstate]] was the most effective substance. Around March 1896, the [[Fluoroscopy|fluoroscope]] he developed became the standard for medical X-ray examinations. Nevertheless, Edison dropped X-ray research around 1903 after the death of [[Clarence Madison Dally]], one of his glassblowers. Dally had a habit of testing X-ray tubes on his hands, and acquired a [[cancer]] in them so tenacious that both arms were [[amputation|amputated]] in a futile attempt to save his life. At the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, an assassin [[William McKinley assassination|shot President William McKinley]] twice at close range with a .32 caliber revolver. The first bullet was removed but the second remained lodged somewhere in his stomach. McKinley survived for some time and requested that Thomas Edison &quot;rush an X-ray machine to Buffalo to find the stray bullet. It arrived ''but wasn't used''&amp;nbsp;... McKinley died of septic shock due to bacterial infection.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Medicine. &quot;Could X-rays Have Saved President William McKinley?&quot; ''Visible Proofs: Forensic Views of the Body''. http://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/galleries/cases/mckinley.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Frank Austin and the Frost brothers====
The first medical X-ray made in the United States was obtained using a discharge tube of Pulyui's design. In January 1896, on reading of Röntgen's discovery, Frank Austin of [[Dartmouth College]] tested all of the discharge tubes in the physics laboratory and found that only the Pulyui tube produced X-rays. This was a result of Pulyui's inclusion of an oblique &quot;target&quot; of [[mica]], used for holding samples of [[fluorescent]] material, within the tube. On 3 February 1896 Gilman Frost, professor of medicine at the college, and his brother Edwin Frost, professor of physics, exposed the wrist of Eddie McCarthy, whom Edwin had treated some weeks earlier for a fracture,  to the X-rays and collected the resulting image of the broken bone on [[Photographic plate|gelatin photographic plates]] obtained from Howard Langill, a local photographer also interested in Röntgen's work.&lt;ref name = PKS&gt;{{cite journal

===The 20th century and beyond===
[[File:Historical X-ray nci-vol-1893-300.jpg|thumb|A male technician taking an x-ray of a female patient in 1940. This image was used to argue that exposure to radiation during the x-ray procedure would be a [[myth]].{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}]]
The many applications of X-rays immediately generated enormous interest.  Workshops began making specialized versions of Crookes tubes for generating X-rays, and these first generation [[cold cathode]] or Crookes X-ray tubes were used until about 1920.

Crookes tubes were unreliable.  They had to contain a small quantity of gas (invariably air) as a current will not flow in such a tube if they are fully evacuated.  However as time passed the X-rays caused the glass to absorb the gas, causing the tube to generate &quot;harder&quot; X-rays until it soon stopped operating.  Larger and more frequently used tubes were provided with devices for restoring the air, known as &quot;softeners&quot;.  These often took the form of a small side tube which contained a small piece of mica: a substance that traps comparatively large quantities of air within its structure.  A small electrical heater heated the mica and caused it to release a small amount of air, thus restoring the tube's efficiency.  However the mica had a limited life and the restore process was consequently difficult to control.

In 1904, [[John Ambrose Fleming]] invented the [[thermionic valve|thermionic diode valve]] (vacuum tube).  This used a [[hot cathode]] which permitted current to flow in a vacuum.  This idea was quickly applied to X-ray tubes, and heated cathode X-ray tubes, called Coolidge tubes, replaced the troublesome cold cathode tubes by about 1920.

Two years later, physicist [[Charles Glover Barkla|Charles Barkla]] discovered that X-rays could be scattered by gases, and that each element had a characteristic X-ray. He won the 1917 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this discovery. [[Max von Laue]], Paul Knipping and Walter Friedrich observed for the first time the [[diffraction]] of X-rays by crystals in 1912. This discovery, along with the early works of [[Paul Peter Ewald]], [[William Henry Bragg]] and [[William Lawrence Bragg]] gave birth to the field of X-ray [[crystallography]]. The [[X-ray tube#Coolidge_tube|Coolidge tube]] was invented the following year by [[William D. Coolidge]] which permitted continuous production of X-rays; this type of tube is still in use today.

[[File:Moon in x-rays.gif|thumb|right|222px|[[ROSAT]] image of X-ray [[fluorescence]] of, and [[occultation]] of the [[X-ray background]] by, the [[Moon]]]]

The use of X-rays for medical purposes (to develop into the field of [[radiation therapy]]) was pioneered by Major [[John Hall-Edwards]] in [[Birmingham]], [[England]]. In 1908, he had to have his left arm amputated owing to the spread of [[Radiation dermatitis|X-ray dermatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/xray|Birmingham.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[X-ray microscope]] was invented in the 1950s.

The [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], launched on July 23, 1999, has been allowing the exploration of the very violent processes in the universe which produce X-rays. Unlike visible light, which is a relatively stable view of the universe, the X-ray universe is unstable, it features stars being torn apart by [[black hole]]s, galactic collisions, and novas, [[neutron star]]s that build up layers of plasma that then explode into space.

An [[X-ray laser]] device was proposed as part of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]]'s [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] in the 1980s, but the first and only test of the device (a sort of laser &quot;blaster&quot;, or [[death ray]], powered by a thermonuclear explosion) gave inconclusive results. For technical and political reasons, the overall project (including the X-ray laser) was de-funded (though was later revived by the second [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] as [[National Missile Defense]] using different technologies).

'''Proton NMR''' (also '''Hydrogen-1 NMR''', or '''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR''') is the application of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] in [[NMR spectroscopy]] with respect to [[hydrogen-1]] [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] within the [[molecules]] of a substance, in order to determine the structure of its molecules &lt;ref&gt;R. M. Silverstein, G. C. Bassler and T. C. Morrill, ''Spectrometric Identification of Organic Compounds'', 5th Ed., Wiley, '''1991'''.&lt;/ref&gt; .  In samples where natural [[hydrogen]] (H) is used, practically all of the hydrogen consists of the [[isotope]] &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H (hydrogen-1; i.e. having a [[proton]] for a nucleus).

Simple NMR spectra are recorded in [[solution]], and [[solvent]] protons must not be allowed to interfere. A solvent without hydrogen, such as [[carbon tetrachloride]] or [[deuterated chloroform]] may be used. More commonly, [[deuterium|deuterated]] (deuterium = &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H, often symbolized as D) solvents especially for use in NMR are preferred, e.g. [[deuterated chloroform]], CDCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide]], (CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO (DMSO).

Historically, deuterated solvents were supplied with a small amount (typically 0.1 %) of [[tetramethylsilane]] (TMS) as an [[internal standard]] for calibrating the [[chemical shift]]s of each analyte proton. TMS is a tetrahedral molecule, with all protons being chemically equivalent, giving one single signal, used to define 0 ppm. It is volatile, making sample recovery easy as well. Modern spectrometers are able to reference spectra based on the residual proton in the solvent (e.g. the CHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.01 % in 99.99 % CDCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Deuterated solvents are now commonly supplied without TMS.

Deuterated solvents permit the use of deuterium frequency-field lock (also known as deuterium lock or field lock) to offset the effect of the natural drift of the NMR's magnetic field  &lt;math&gt;B_0&lt;/math&gt;. In order to provide deuterium lock, the NMR constantly monitors the deuterium signal resonance frequency from the solvent and makes changes to the &lt;math&gt;B_0&lt;/math&gt; to keep the resonance frequency constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference| number = 4110681| y = 1978| m = 08| d = 29| inventor = Donald C. Hofer; Vincent N. Kahwaty; Carl R. Kahwaty| title = NMR field frequency lock system}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the deuterium signal may be used to accurately define 0 ppm as the resonant frequency of the lock solvent and the difference between the lock solvent and 0 ppm (TMS) are well known.

Proton NMR spectra of most organic compounds are characterized by [[chemical shift]]s in the range +12 to -4 ppm and by  [[spin-spin coupling]] between protons. The [[Integral|integration curve]] for each proton reflects the abundance of the individual protons.

Simple molecules have simple spectra. The spectrum of [[ethyl chloride]] consists of a triplet at 1.5 ppm and a quartet at 3.5 ppm in a 3:2 ratio. The spectrum of [[benzene]] consists of a single peak at 7.2 ppm due to the [[diamagnetic ring current]].

Together with [[Carbon-13 NMR]], proton NMR is a powerful tool for molecular structure characterization.

==Chemical shifts==
[[Chemical shift]] values are not precise, but typical - they are to be therefore regarded mainly as orientational. Deviations are in ±0.2 [[Parts per million|ppm]] range, sometimes more. The exact value of chemical shift depends on molecular structure and the [[solvent]] in which the spectrum is being recorded. Hydrogen nuclei are sensitive to the hybridisation of the atom to which the proton is attached and to [[electronic effect]]s. Nuclei tend to be deshielded by groups which withdraw electron density. Deshielded nuclei resonate at higher δ values, whereas shielded nuclei resonate at lower δ values.

Examples of electron withdrawing substituents are -OH, -OCOR, -OR, -NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and halogens. These cause a downfield shift of approximately 2-4ppm at C&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; and of less than 1-2 ppm at C&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;. Carbonyl groups, olefinic fragments and aromatic rings contribute ''sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' hybridised carbon atoms to an aliphatic chain. This causes a downfield shift of 1-2 ppm at C&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;.

Note that labile protons (-OH, -NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SH) have no characteristic chemical shift. However such resonances can be identified by the disappearance of a peak when reacted with [[Heavy water|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]], as [[deuterium]] will replace a [[proton]]. This method is called a '''D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O shake'''. Acidic protons may also be suppressed when a solvent containing acidic deuterium ions (e.g. methanol-''d''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is used.

==Spin-spin couplings==


The [[chemical shift]] is not the only indicator used to assign a molecule. Because nuclei themselves are little magnets they influence each other, changing the energy and hence frequency of nearby nuclei as they resonate&amp;mdash;this is known as [[spin-spin coupling]]. The most important type in basic NMR is ''scalar coupling''. This interaction between two nuclei occurs through [[chemical bond]]s, and can typically be seen up to three bonds away.

The effect of scalar coupling can be understood by examination of a proton which has a signal at 1ppm. This  proton is in a hypothetical molecule where three bonds away exists another proton (in a CH-CH group for instance), the neighbouring group (a [[magnetic field]]) causes the signal at 1 ppm to split into two, with one peak being a few [[hertz]] higher than 1 ppm and the other peak being the same number of hertz lower than 1 ppm. These peaks each have half the area of the former '''singlet''' peak. The magnitude of this splitting (difference in frequency between peaks) is known as the [[J-coupling|coupling constant]]. A typical coupling constant value would be 7 Hz.

The coupling constant is independent of magnetic field strength because it is caused by the magnetic field of another nucleus, not the spectrometer magnet. Therefore it is quoted in [[hertz]] (frequency) and not ppm ([[chemical shift]]).

In another molecule a proton resonates at 2.5 ppm and that proton would also be split into two by the proton at 1 ppm. Because the magnitude of interaction is the same the splitting would have the same coupling constant 7 Hz apart. The spectrum would have two signals, each being a '''doublet'''.  Each doublet will have the same area because both doublets are produced by one proton each.

The two doublets at 1 ppm and 2.5 ppm from the fictional molecule CH-CH are now changed into CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH:
*The total area of the 1 ppm CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; peak will be twice that of the 2.5 ppm CH peak.
*The CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; peak will be split into a doublet by the CH peak&amp;mdash;with one peak at 1 ppm + 3.5 Hz and one at 1 ppm - 3.5 Hz (total splitting or coupling constant is 7 Hz).

In consequence the CH peak at 2.5 ppm will be split ''twice'' by each proton from the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The first proton will split the peak into two equal intensities and will go from one peak at 2.5 ppm to two peaks, one at 2.5 ppm + 3.5 Hz and the other at 2.5 ppm - 3.5 Hz&amp;mdash;each having equal intensities. However these will be split again by the second proton. The frequencies will change accordingly:
*The 2.5 ppm''' + '''3.5 Hz signal will be split into 2.5 ppm + 7 Hz and 2.5 ppm
*The 2.5 ppm''' - '''3.5 Hz signal will be split into 2.5 ppm and 2.5 ppm - 7 Hz

The net result is not a signal consisting of 4 peaks but three: one signal at 7 Hz above 2.5 ppm, two signals occur at 2.5 ppm, and a final one at 7 Hz below 2.5 ppm. The ratio of height between them is 1:2:1. This is known as a '''triplet''' and is an indicator that the proton is three-bonds from a CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group.

This can be extended to any CH&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; group. When the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH group is changed to CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, keeping the chemical shift and coupling constants identical, the following changes are observed:
*The relative areas between the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; subunits will be 3:2.
*The CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is coupled to two protons into a 1:2:1 '''triplet''' around 1 ppm.
*The CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is coupled to ''three'' protons.
Something split by three identical protons takes a shape known as a '''quartet''', each peak having relative intensities of 1:3:3:1.

A peak is split by ''n'' identical protons into components whose sizes are in the ratio of the ''n''th row of [[Pascal's triangle]]:
   n
   0   singlet                          1
   1   doublet                        1   1
   2   triplet                      1   2   1
   3   quartet                    1   3   3   1
   4   pentet                   1   4   6   4   1
   5   sextet                 1   5  10  10   5   1
   6   septet               1   6  15  20  15   6   1
   7   octet              1   7  21  35  35   21  7   1
   8   nonet            1   8  28  56  70  56   28   8  1

Because the ''n''th row has ''n''+1 components, this type of splitting is said to follow the &quot;''n''+1 rule&quot;: a proton with ''n'' neighbors appears as a cluster of ''n''+1 peaks.

With 2-methylpropane, (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH, as another example: the CH proton is attached to three identical methyl groups. The C-H signal in the spectrum would be split into '''ten''' peaks according to the (n + 1) rule of multiplicity. Below are NMR signals corresponding to several simple multiplets of this type.  Note that the outer lines of the nonet (which are only 1/8 as high as those of the second peak) can barely be seen, giving a superficial resemblance to a septet.

[[Image:J-Coupling-simple-multiplets.gif]]

When a proton is coupled to two different protons, then the coupling constants are likely to be different, and instead of a triplet, a doublet of doublets will be seen. Similarly, if a proton is coupled to two other protons of one type, and a third of another type with a different coupling constant, then a triplet of doublets is seen. In the example below, the triplet coupling constant is larger than the doublet one. The analysis of such multiplets (which can get very much more complicated than the ones shown here) provides important clues to the structure of the molecule being studied.

[[Image:J-Coupling-complex-multiplets.gif]]

It should be emphasized that the simple rules for the spin-spin splitting of NMR signals described above only apply if the chemical shifts of the coupling partners are substantially larger that the coupling constant between them, otherwise there may be more peaks, and the intensities of the individual peaks will be distorted (second-order effects).

==Carbon satellites and spinning sidebands==
Occasionally, small peaks can be seen shouldering the main 1H NMR peaks.  These peaks are not the result of proton-proton coupling, but result from the coupling of 1H atoms to an adjoining [[carbon 13]] atom. These small peaks are known as [[Carbon-13 NMR satellite|carbon satellite]]s as they are small and appear around the main 1H peak i.e. [[satellite]] (around) to them.  Carbon satellites are small because [[Carbon 13]] only makes up about 1% of the atomic carbon content of carbon, the rest of the carbon atoms are predominantly NMR inactive [[Carbon 12]].  Carbon satellites always appear as an evenly spaced pair around the main 1H peak. This is because they are the result of 1% of the 1H atoms coupling to an adjoined [[Carbon 13|13C atom]] to give a wide doublet (carbon 13 has a spin of a half).  Note, if the main 1H-peak has proton-proton coupling, then each satellite will be a miniature version of the main peak and will also show this 1H-coupling, e.g. if the main 1H-peak is a doublet, then the carbon satellites will appear as miniature doublets, i.e. one doublet on either side of the main 1H-peak.  Sometime other peaks can be seen around 1H peaks, these are known as [[spinning sidebands]] and are related to the rate of spin of an [[NMR tube]].  Carbon satellites and spinning sidebands should not be confused with impurity peaks &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gottlieb HE, Kotlyar V, Nudelman A |title=NMR Chemical Shifts of Common Laboratory Solvents as Trace Impurities |journal=J.

'''Proton Transfer Reaction - Mass Spectrometry''' (PTR-MS) is a very sensitive technique for online monitoring of [[Volatile organic compound|volatile organic compounds (VOCs)]] in ambient air developed by scientists at the Institut für Ionenphysik at the [[University of Innsbruck|Leopold-Franzens University in Innsbruck]], Austria&lt;ref&gt;A. Hansel, A. Jordan, R. Holzinger, P. Prazeller W. Vogel, W. Lindinger, Proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry: on-line trace gas analysis at ppb level, ''Int. J. of Mass Spectrom. and Ion Proc.'', 149/150, 609-619 ('''1995''').&lt;/ref&gt;. A PTR-MS instrument consists of an [[ion source]] that is directly connected to a drift tube (in contrast to [[Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry|SIFT-MS]] no mass filter is interconnected) and an analyzing system ([[Quadrupole mass analyzer]] or [[Time-of-flight mass spectrometry|Time-of-flight mass spectrometer]]). Commercially available PTR-MS instruments have a [[Response time (technology)|response time]] of about 100ms and reach a [[detection limit]] in the single digit [[Parts-per notation|pptv]] region. Established fields of application are environmental research, food and flavour science, biological research, medicine, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;ptrmsHP&quot;&gt;http://www.ptrms.com/documentation/publications.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uibkHP&quot;&gt;http://www.uibk.ac.at/ionen-angewandte-physik/umwelt/publications/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Theory ==
With [[Hydronium|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] as the primary ion the proton transfer process is (with &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; being the trace component)
:&lt;math&gt;H_3O^+ + R \longrightarrow RH^+ + H_2O&lt;/math&gt;  (1).
Reaction (1) is only possible if energetically allowed, i.e. if the [[proton affinity]] of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is higher than the proton affinity of [[Water (molecule)|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] (691 kJ/mol &lt;ref&gt;Blake ''et al.'' Chem. Rev. 2009, 109, 861-896&lt;/ref&gt;). As most components of [[Earth's atmosphere|ambient air]] possess a lower proton affinity than H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (e.g. [[Nitrogen|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Argon|Ar]], [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], etc.) the H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions only reacts with VOC trace components and the air itself acts as a [[buffer gas]]. Moreover due to the low number of trace components one can assume that the total number of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions remains nearly unchanged, which leads to the equation&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindinger&quot;&gt;W. Lindinger, A. Hansel and A. Jordan, On-line monitoring of volatile organic compounds at pptv levels by means of Proton-Transfer-Reaction Mass-Spectrometry (PTR-MS): Medical applications, food control and environmental research, Review paper, ''Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Proc.'', 173, 191-241 ('''1998''').&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lbrack RH^+\rbrack = \lbrack H_3O^+\rbrack_0 \left (1-e^{-k\lbrack R\rbrack t}\right )\approx \lbrack H_3O^+\rbrack _0 \lbrack R\rbrack kt&lt;/math&gt;  (2).
In equation (2) &lt;math&gt;\lbrack RH^+\rbrack&lt;/math&gt; is the density of product ions, &lt;math&gt;\lbrack H_3O^+\rbrack_0&lt;/math&gt; is the density of primary ions in absence of reactant molecules in the buffer gas, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reaction rate constant]] and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the average time the ions need to pass the reaction region. With a PTR-MS instrument the number of product and of primary ions can be measured, the reaction rate constant can be found in literature for most substances&lt;ref&gt;Y. Ikezoe, S. Matsuoka and A. Viggiano, Gas Phase Ion-Molecule Reaction Rate Constants through 1986, ''Maruzen Company Ltd.'', Tokyo, ('''1987''').&lt;/ref&gt; and the reaction time can be derived from the set instrument parameters. Therefore the absolute [[concentration]] of trace constituents &lt;math&gt;\lbrack R\rbrack&lt;/math&gt; can be easily calculated without the need of [[calibration]] or gas standards. 

== Technology ==
In commercial PTR-MS instruments water vapour is ionized in a hollow cathode discharge:
:&lt;math&gt;e^- + H_2O \longrightarrow H_2O^+ + 2e^-&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e^- + H_2O \longrightarrow H_2^+ + O + 2e^-&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e^- + H_2O \longrightarrow H^+ + OH + 2e^-&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e^- + H_2O \longrightarrow O^+ + H_2 + 2e^-&lt;/math&gt;.
After the discharge a short drift tube is used to form very pure (&gt;99.5%&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindinger&quot; /&gt;) H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; via ion-molecule reactions:
:&lt;math&gt;H_2^+ + H_2O \rightarrow H_2O^+ + H_2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H^+ + H_2O \rightarrow H_2O^+ + H&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;O^+ + H_2O \rightarrow H_2O^+ + O&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_2O^+ + H_2O \longrightarrow H_3O^+ + OH&lt;/math&gt;.
Due to the high purity of the primary ions a mass filter between the ion source and the reaction drift tube is not necessary and the H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions can be injected directly. The absence of this mass filter in turn greatly reduces losses of primary ions and leads eventually to an outstandingly low detection limit of the whole instrument. 
In the reaction drift tube a [[vacuum pump]] is continuously drawing through air containing the VOCs one wants to analyze. At the end of the drift tube the protonated molecules are mass analyzed ([[Quadrupole mass analyzer]] or [[Time-of-flight mass spectrometry|Time-of-flight mass spectrometer]]) and detected. 
=== Advantages of PTR-MS === 
* ''Low fragmentation:'' Only a small amount of energy is transferred during the ionization process (compared to e.g. [[Electron ionization|electron impact ionization]]), therefore fragmentation is suppressed and the obtained [[Mass spectrum|mass spectra]] are easily interpretable. 
* ''No sample preparation is necessary:'' VOC containing air and fluids headspaces can be analyzed directly.
* ''Real-time measurements:'' With a typical response time of 100ms VOCs can be monitored on-line.
* ''Real-time quantification:'' Absolute concentrations are obtained directly without previous calibration measurements.
* ''Compact and robust setup:'' Due to the simple design and the low number of parts needed for a PTR-MS instrument, it can be built in into space saving and even mobile housings. 
* ''Easy to operate:'' For the operation of a PTR-MS only [[electric power]] and a small amount of [[Purified water|distilled water]] are needed. Unlike other techniques no [[gas cylinder]]s are needed for buffer gas or calibration standards.

=== Disadvantages of PTR-MS ===
* ''Not all molecules detectable:'' Because only molecules with a proton affinity higher than water can be detected by PTR-MS, the technology is not suitable for all fields of application.
* ''Maximum measurable concentration limited:'' Equation (2) is based on the assumption that the decrease of primary ions is neglectable, therefore the total concentration of VOCs in air must not exceed 10[[Parts-per notation|ppmv]].

== Applications ==
The most common applications for the PTR-MS technique are:&lt;ref name=&quot;ptrmsHP&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uibkHP&quot; /&gt;

In 2008 C. Lindinger et al. published an article&lt;ref&gt;C. Lindinger, D. Labbe, P. Pollien, A. Rytz, M. A. Juillerat, C. Yeretzian, I. Blank, When Machine Tastes Coffee: Instrumental Approach To Predict the Sensory Profile of Espresso Coffee, ''Anal. Chem.'', 80 (5) 1574-1581, ('''2008'''). &lt;/ref&gt; in &quot;[[Analytical Chemistry (journal)|Analytical Chemistry]]&quot; that found great response even in non-scientific media&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23359908/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/science/19objava.html?ex=1361077200&amp;en=393e1220ba7a4cf1&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink&lt;/ref&gt;. Lindinger et al. developed a method to convert &quot;dry&quot; data from a PTR-MS instrument that measured headspace air from different [[coffee]] samples into expressions of [[Flavor|flavour]] (e.g. &quot;woody&quot;, &quot;winey&quot;, &quot;flowery&quot;, etc.) and showed that the obtained flavour profiles matched nicely to the ones created by a panel of European coffee tasting experts.
&lt;br /&gt;An extensive review about PTR-MS and some of its applications was published in 2007 in &quot;Mass Spectrometry Reviews&quot; by Joost de Gouw et al.&lt;ref&gt;J. de Gouw, C. Warneke, T.

In [[Nuclear_magnetic_resonance#Fourier_spectroscopy|Fourier Transform NMR spectroscopy and imaging]], a '''pulse sequence''' describes a series of [[radio frequency]] pulses applied to the sample, such that a [[free induction decay]] is induced whose signal can be recorded in the [[time domain]]. After applying a [[Fourier Transform]], the signal can be represented in the [[frequency domain]] as the [[NMR spectrum]]. In [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]], additional ''gradient pulses'' are being applied by switching magnetic fields that exhibit a space-dependent gradient which can be used to reconstruct, after Fourier Transform, spatially resolved images.&lt;ref name=Bernstein2005&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''Pulsed field gradient''' is a short, timed pulse with spatial dependent field intensity. Any gradient is identified by four characteristics: axis, strength, shape and duration. 

Pulsed field gradient (PFG) techniques are key to magnetic resonance imaging, spatially selective spectroscopy and studies of diffusion via NMR. PFG techniques are widely used as an alternative to phase cycling in modern NMR spectroscopy. 

==Common field gradients in NMR==
The effect of a uniform magnetic field gradient in the z-direction on spin I, is considered to be a rotation around z-axis by an angle = γ&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;Gz; where G is the gradient magnitude and γ&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; is the gyromagnetic ratio of spin I. It introduces a phase factor to the magnetizations:

''Φ (z,τ) = γ&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;zGτ''

The time duration τ is of order ms.

The aim of '''quantitative proteomics''' is to obtain quantitative information about all [[protein]]s in a sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ong SE, Mann M | date=2005 | title=Mass spectrometry-based proteomics turns quantitative | journal=Nature Chemical Biology |volume=1 |pages=252–262 |pmid=16408053 |url=http://www.nature.com/nchembio/journal/v1/n5/abs/nchembio736.html | doi=10.1038/nchembio736 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17668192&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bantscheff M, Schirle M, Sweetman G, Rick J, Kuster B |title=Quantitative mass spectrometry in proteomics: a critical review |journal=Anal Bioanal Chem |volume=389 |issue=4 |pages=1017–31 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17668192 |doi=10.1007/s00216-007-1486-6 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than just providing lists of proteins identified in a certain sample, quantitative proteomics yields information about differences between samples. For example, this approach can be used to compare samples from healthy and diseased patients. The methods for protein identification are identical to those used in general (i.e. qualitative) [[proteomics]], but include quantification as an additional dimension.
 
==Mass spectrometry-based proteomics==
Due to differences in ionization efficiency and/or detectability the intensity of a peak in a [[mass spectrum]] is not a good indicator of the amount of the analyte. However, differences in peak intensity of the ''same'' analyte accurately reflect differences in its abundance. Therefore, in [[mass spectrometry]]-based proteomics ''relative'' quantification is used to compare protein abundance between samples. This can be achieved by labeling one sample with [[stable isotope]]s alone or incorporated into protein crosslinkers like [[BisSulfosuccinimidyl suberate|D4-BS3]], which leads to a mass shift in the mass spectrum. Differentially labeled samples are combined and analyzed together. The differences in the peak intensities of the isotope pairs accurately reflect difference in the abundance of the corresponding proteins. Current 
methods include:
* [[ICAT|Isotope-Coded Affinity Tags (ICAT)]])
* [[Isobaric labeling]]
** [[Tandem mass tags|Tandem mass tags (TMT)]]
** [[iTRAQ|Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)]]
* [[Label-free quantification]] / [[No Label Quantitation]] 
* Metal Coded Tags ([[MeCAT]]s)
* [[N-Terminal Labelling]]
* Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino Acids in Cell Culture ([[SILAC]])

MeCAT can be used in combination with element mass spectrometry [[ICP-MS]] allowing first-time absolute quantification of the metal bound by MeCAT reagent to a protein or biomolecule. Thus it is possible to determine the absolute amount of protein down to attomol range using external calibration by metal standard solution. It is compatible to protein separation by 2D electrophoresis and chromatography in multiplex experiments. Protein identification and relative quantification can be performed by MALDI-MS/MS and ESI-MS/MS.

==Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis==
Modern day gel electrophoresis research often leverages software-based image analysis tools primarily to analyze bio-markers by quantifying individual, as well as showing the separation between one or more protein &quot;spots&quot; on a scanned image of a [[two-dimensional gel electrophoresis|2-DE]] product. Differential staining of gels with fluorescent dyes ([[difference gel electrophoresis]]) can also be used to highlight differences in the spot pattern.

[[Image:Quenching of Quinine fluorescence by chloride ions.JPG|thumb|Quenching of quinine fluorescence (right) by chloride ions (left)]]
'''Quenching''' refers to any process which decreases the [[fluorescence]] intensity of a given substance. A variety of processes can result in quenching, such as [[excited state]] reactions, energy transfer, complex-formation and collisional quenching. As a consequence, quenching is often heavily dependent on [[pressure]] and [[temperature]]. Molecular [[oxygen]] and the [[iodine|iodide]] ion are common chemical quenchers. Quenching poses a problem for non-instant spectroscopic methods, such as [[laser-induced fluorescence]].

Quenching is made use of in [[optode]] sensors; for instance the quenching effect of oxygen on certain [[ruthenium]] complexes allows the measurement of [[oxygen saturation]] in solution. Quenching is the basis for [[fluorescence resonance energy transfer]] (FRET) assays.&lt;ref&gt;Peng, X., Draney, D.R., Volcheck, W.M., Quenched near-infrared fluorescent peptide substrate for HIV-1 protease assay, Proc.

==  Quenching mechanisms ==

There are a few distinct mechanisms by which energy can be transferred nonradiatively (without absorption or emission of photons) between two dyes, a donor and an acceptor. [[Förster resonance energy transfer]] (FRET or FET) is a dynamic quenching mechanism because energy transfer occurs while the donor is in the excited state. FRET is based on classical dipole-dipole interactions between the transition [[dipole]]s of the donor and acceptor and is extremely dependent on the donor – acceptor distance ('''''R'''''), falling off at a rate of 1/'''''R'''''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. FRET also depends on the donor-acceptor spectral overlap (see figure below) and the relative orientation of the donor and acceptor transition dipole moments. FRET can typically occur over distances up to 100 Å.
 
[[Dexter electron transfer|Dexter]] (also known as exchange or collisional energy transfer) is another dynamic quenching mechanism. Dexter energy transfer is a short-range phenomenon that decreases with e&lt;sup&gt;-'''''R'''''&lt;/sup&gt; and depends on spatial overlap of donor and quencher molecular orbitals. In most donor fluorophore – quencher acceptor situations, the Förster mechanism is more important than the Dexter mechanism. With both Förster and Dexter energy transfer, the shapes of the absorption and fluorescence spectra of the dyes are unchanged.

[[Exciplex]] (excited state complex) formation is a third dynamic quenching mechanism.
	
The remaining energy transfer mechanism is [[static quenching]] (also referred to as contact quenching). Static quenching can be a dominant mechanism for some reporter-quencher probes. Unlike dynamic quenching, static quenching occurs when the donor and acceptor molecules are in the ground state. The donor and acceptor molecules bind together to form a ground state complex, an intramolecular dimer with its own unique properties, such as being nonfluorescent and having a unique [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] [[spectrum]]. Dye aggregation is often due to [[hydrophobic]] effects – the dye molecules stack together to minimize contact with water. Planar aromatic dyes that are matched for association through hydrophobic, electrostatic and steric forces can enhance static quenching.  High temperatures and addition of surfactants tend to disrupt ground state complex formation.

A '''radical ion''' is a [[Radical (chemistry)|free radical]] species that carries a [[charge (chemistry)|charge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=radical ion|file= R05073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical [[ion]]s are encountered in [[organic chemistry]] as [[reactive intermediates]] and in [[mass spectrometry]] as gas phase ions. Positive radical ions are called radical cations whereas negative radical ions are called radical anions.

==Notation==
In organic chemistry, a radical ion is typically indicated by a superscript dot followed by the sign of the charge:  &lt;math&gt;M^{\bullet +}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M^{\bullet -}&lt;/math&gt;. In mass spectrometry, the sign is written first, followed by the superscripted dot:  &lt;math&gt;M^{+\bullet}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M^{-\bullet}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-9660813-2-3&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Sparkman, O. David |title=Mass spectrometry desk reference |publisher=Global View Pub |location=Pittsburgh |year=2000 |isbn=0-9660813-2-3 |oclc= |doi= |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radical anions ==
Many [[aromatic]] compounds can undergo [[one-electron reduction]] by [[alkali metal]]s. For example the reaction of [[naphthalene]] with [[sodium]] in an aprotic solvent yields the naphthalene '''radical anion''' - sodium ion salt. In a [[ESR spectrum]] this compound shows up as a [[quintet]] of quintets (25 lines). In the presence of a [[hydrogen ion|proton]] source the radical anion is protonated and effectively hydrogenated like in the [[Birch reduction]].

The electron is transferred from the alkali metal ion to an unoccupied antibonding p-p п* orbital of the aromatic molecule.  This transfer is usually only energetically favorable if the aprotic solvent efficiently solvates the alkali metal ion.  Effectiveness for this is in the order [[diethyl ether]] &lt; THF &lt; [[dimethoxyethane|1,2-dimethoxyethane]] &lt; [[HMPA]].  In principle any unsaturated molecule can form a radical anion, but the antibonding orbitals are only energetically accessible in more extensive conjugated systems.  Ease of formation is in the order [[benzene]] &lt; [[naphthalene]] &lt; [[anthracene]] &lt; [[pyrene]], etc.  On addition of a proton source, the structure of the resulting hydrogenated molecule is defined by the charge distribution of the radical anion.  For instance, the anthracene radical anion forms mainly (but not exclusively) 9,10-dihydroanthracene.

An example of a non-carbon radical anion is the [[superoxide]] anion, formed by transfer of one electron to an [[oxygen]] molecule.

A very effective way to remove any traces of water from [[THF]] is by [[reflux]] with [[sodium]] wire in the presence of a small amount of [[benzophenone]]. Benzophenone is reduced to the [[ketyl]] radical anion by sodium which gives the THF solution an intense blue color. However, any trace of water in THF will further reduce the ketyl to the colourless [[alcohol]]. In this way, the color of the THF signals the dryness and the [[distilled]] THF contains less than 10 [[Parts per million|ppm]] of water.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/equipment/benzophenone.ketyl.html&lt;/ref&gt; This treatment also effectively removes any peroxides in the THF.  Radical anions of this type are also involved in the [[Acyloin condensation]].

[[Cyclooctatetraene]] is reduced by elemental [[potassium]] directly to the dianion (skipping the radical anion state) because the 10 electron system is anti-aromatic. [[Quinone]] is reduced to a [[semiquinone]] radical anion. [[Semidione]]s are derived from the reduction of dicarbonyl compounds.

== Radical cations ==
Cationic radical species do also exist but are much less stable. They appear prominently in [[mass spectroscopy]]. When a gas-phase molecule is subjected to [[electron ionization]] one electron is abstracted by an electron in the electron beam to create a radical cation M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;. This species represents the [[molecular ion]] or parent ion and will tell the precise [[molecular weight]]. On a typical [[mass spectrum]] more signals show up because the molecular ion fragments into a complex mixture of ions and uncharged radical species. For example the [[methanol]] radical cation fragments into a [[methyl]] cation CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and a [[hydroxyl]] radical. In [[naphthalene]] the unfragmented radical cation is by far the most prominent peak in the mass spectrum. Secondary species are generated from [[hydrogen ion|proton]] gain (M+1) and proton loss (M-1). 

[[Polaron]]s and [[bipolaron]]s are radical cations encountered in doped [[conducting polymer]]s.

[[Image:Raman energy levels.jpg|350px|thumb|Energy level diagram showing the states involved in Raman signal. The line thickness is roughly proportional to the signal strength from the different transitions.]]

'''Raman spectroscopy''' (pronounced: {{IPA|[rə.mən]}} S—) is a [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] technique used in [[condensed matter physics]] and [[chemistry]] to study vibrational, rotational, and other low-frequency modes in a system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardiner&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Gardiner| first = D.J.| authorlink = | title = Practical Raman spectroscopy| publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]| series = | year = 1989| doi = | isbn = 978-0387502540}}&lt;/ref&gt; It relies on [[elastic scattering|inelastic]] scattering, or [[Raman scattering]], of monochromatic light, usually from a [[laser]] in the [[visible]], [[infrared|near infrared]], or [[ultraviolet|near ultraviolet]] range. The laser light interacts with [[phonon]]s or other excitations in the system, resulting in the energy of the laser photons being shifted up or down. The shift in energy gives information about the phonon modes in the system. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] yields similar, but complementary, information.

Typically, a sample is illuminated with a laser beam. Light from the illuminated spot is collected with a [[lens (optics)|lens]] and sent through a [[monochromator]]. Wavelengths close to the laser line, due to elastic [[Rayleigh scattering]], are filtered out while the rest of the collected light is dispersed onto a detector.

Spontaneous [[Raman scattering]] is typically very weak, and as a result the main difficulty of Raman spectroscopy is separating the weak inelastically scattered light from the intense Rayleigh scattered laser light. Historically, Raman [[spectrometer]]s used holographic [[diffraction grating]]s and multiple dispersion stages to achieve a high degree of laser rejection. In the past, [[Photomultiplier|PMTs]] were the detectors of choice for dispersive Raman setups, which resulted in long acquisition times. However, modern instrumentation almost universally employs [[Notch filter|notch]] or [[Edge filter|edge]] filters for laser rejection and spectrographs (either Czerny-Turner, echelle or FT based) and [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] detectors.

There are a number of advanced types of Raman spectroscopy, including surface-enhanced Raman, polarised Raman, stimulated Raman (analogous to [[stimulated emission]]), transmission Raman, spatially-offset Raman, and hyper Raman.

== Basic theory ==

The Raman effect occurs when light impinges upon a [[molecule]] and interacts with the electron cloud of the bonds of that molecule. The incident [[photon]] excites one of the phonons into a virtual state. For the spontaneous Raman effect, the molecule will be excited from the ground state to a virtual energy state, and relax into a vibrational excited state, which generates Stokes Raman scattering. If the molecule was already in an elevated vibrational energy state, the Raman scattering is then called anti-Stokes Raman scattering.

A change in the molecular polarization potential — or amount of deformation of the electron cloud — with respect to the [[molecular vibration|vibrational coordinate]] is required for the molecule to exhibit the Raman effect. The amount of the polarizability change will determine the Raman scattering intensity, whereas the Raman shift is equal to the vibrational level that is involved.

== History ==

[[image:CVRaman.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Sir Chandrasekhara V. Raman.]]

Although the inelastic scattering of light was predicted by Smekal in 1923, it was not until 1928 that it was observed in practice. The Raman effect was named after one of its discoverers, the Indian scientist [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman|Sir C. V. Raman]] who observed the effect by means of sunlight (1928, together with K. S. Krishnan and independently by [[Grigory Landsberg]] and [[Leonid Isaakovich Mandelstam|Leonid Mandelstam]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardiner&quot; /&gt; Raman won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1930 for this discovery accomplished using sunlight, a narrow band photographic filter to create monochromatic light and a &quot;crossed&quot; filter to block this monochromatic light. He found that light of changed frequency passed through the &quot;crossed&quot; filter.

Systematic pioneering theory of Raman effect was developed by Czechoslovak physicist [[George Placzek]] between 1930 and 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Placzek G.: &quot;Rayleigh Streeung und Raman Effekt&quot;, In: Hdb. der Radiologie, Vol. VI., 2, 1934, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; The mercury arc became the principal light source, first with photographic detection and then with spectrophotometric detection. Currently lasers are used as light sources.

== Applications ==

Raman spectroscopy is commonly used in chemistry, since vibrational information is specific for the chemical bonds in molecules. It therefore provides a fingerprint by which the molecule can be identified. The fingerprint region of organic molecules is in the ([[wavenumber]]) range 500–2000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. For instance, the vibrational frequencies of SiO, Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; were identified and assigned on the basis of normal coordinate analyses using infrared and Raman spectra.&lt;ref name=&quot;R. K. Khanna and D. D. Stranz&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Khanna| first = R.K.| authorlink = | title = Raman-spectroscopy of oligomeric SiO species isolated in solid methane| publisher = [[J. Chem. Phys.|Journal of Chemical Physics]]| series = | year = 1981| doi = 10.1063/1.441393| isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another way that the technique is used is to study changes in chemical bonding, e.g., when a substrate is added to an enzyme.

Raman gas analyzers have many practical applications. For instance, they are used in medicine for real-time monitoring of anaesthetic and respiratory gas mixtures during surgery.

In solid state physics, spontaneous Raman spectroscopy is used to, among other things, characterize materials, measure [[temperature]], and find the crystallographic orientation of a sample. As with single molecules, a given solid material has characteristic [[phonon]] modes that can help an experimenter identify it. In addition, Raman spectroscopy can be used to observe other low frequency excitations of the solid, such as [[plasmon]]s, magnons, and [[BCS theory|superconducting gap]] excitations. The spontaneous Raman signal gives information on the population of a given phonon mode in the ratio between the Stokes (downshifted) intensity and anti-Stokes (upshifted) intensity.

Raman scattering by an anisotropic [[crystal]] gives information on the crystal orientation. The [[polarization]] of the Raman scattered light with respect to the crystal and the polarization of the laser light can be used to find the orientation of the crystal, if the [[crystal structure]] (specifically, its [[crystallographic point group|point group]]) is known.

Raman active fibers, such as aramid and carbon, have vibrational modes that show a shift in Raman frequency with applied stress.  Polypropylene fibers also exhibit similar shifts. The radial breathing mode is a commonly used technique to evaluate the diameter of carbon nanotubes. In nanotechnology, a Raman Microscope can be used to analyze nanowires to better understand the composition of the structures.

Spatially-offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS), which is less sensitive to surface layers than conventional Raman, can be used to discover [[counterfeit drugs]] without opening their internal packaging, and for non-invasive monitoring of biological tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6314287.stm | publisher=BBC News |date=2007-01-31 | accessdate=2008-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Raman spectroscopy can be used to investigate the chemical composition of historical documents such as the [[Book of Kells]] and contribute to knowledge of the social and economic conditions at the time the documents were produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/28/world/europe/28kells.html Irish Classic Is Still a Hit (in Calfskin, Not Paperback) - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is especially helpful because Raman spectroscopy offers a non-invasive way to determine the best course of [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] or [[art conservation|conservation]] treatment for such materials.

Raman spectroscopy is being investigated as a means to detect [[explosives]] for [[airport security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.janes.com/news/transport/business/jar/jar080829_1_n.shtml |title=Raman spectroscopy portends well for standoff explosives detection  |accessdate=2008-08-29 |author=Ben Vogel |date=29 August 2008 |publisher=Jane's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Microspectroscopy ==

Raman spectroscopy offers several advantages for [[microscopy|microscopic]] analysis.  Since it is a scattering technique, specimens do not need to be fixed or sectioned. Raman spectra can be collected from a very small volume (&lt; 1&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter); these spectra allow the identification of species present in that volume. Water does not generally interfere with Raman spectral analysis.  Thus, Raman spectroscopy is suitable for the microscopic examination of [[mineral]]s, materials such as polymers and ceramics, [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and [[proteins]].  A Raman microscope begins with a standard optical microscope, and adds an excitation laser, a [[monochromator]], and a sensitive detector (such as a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD),  or [[photomultiplier]] tube (PMT)). [[Fourier transform spectroscopy|FT-Raman]] has also been used with microscopes.

In ''direct imaging'', the whole field of view is examined for scattering over a small range of wavenumbers (Raman shifts).  For instance, a wavenumber characteristic for cholesterol could be used to record the distribution of cholesterol within a cell culture.

The other approach is ''[[hyperspectral imaging]]'' or ''[[chemical imaging]]'', in which thousands of Raman spectra are acquired from all over the field of view.  The data can then be used to generate images showing the location and amount of different components.  Taking the cell culture example, a hyperspectral image could show the distribution of cholesterol, as well as proteins, nucleic acids, and fatty acids.  Sophisticated signal- and image-processing techniques can be used to ignore the presence of water, culture media, buffers, and other interferents.

Raman microscopy, and in particular [[confocal microscopy|confocal]] microscopy, has very high spatial resolution.  For example, the lateral and depth resolutions were 250&amp;nbsp;nm and 1.7&amp;nbsp;µm, respectively, using a confocal Raman microspectrometer with the 632.8&amp;nbsp;nm line from a He-Ne [[laser]] with a pinhole of 100&amp;nbsp;µm diameter. Since the objective lenses of microscopes focus the laser beam to several micrometres in diameter, the resulting photon flux is much higher than achieved in conventional Raman setups.  This has the added benefit of enhanced [[fluorescence quenching]].  However, the high photon flux can also cause sample degradation, and for this reason some setups require a thermally conducting substrate (which acts as a heat sink) in order to mitigate this process.

By using Raman microspectroscopy, ''in vivo'' time- and space-resolved Raman spectra of microscopic regions of samples can be measured. As a result, the [[fluorescence]] of water, media, and buffers can be removed.  Consequently ''in vivo'' time- and space-resolved Raman spectroscopy is suitable to examine [[proteins]], [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and [[organ (anatomy)|organs]].

Raman microscopy for biological and medical specimens generally uses [[near-infrared]] (NIR) lasers (785&amp;nbsp;nm diodes and 1064&amp;nbsp;nm Nd:YAG are especially common).  This reduces the risk of damaging the specimen by applying higher energy wavelengths.  However, the intensity of NIR Raman is low (owing to the ω&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; dependence of Raman scattering intensity), and most detectors required very long collection times.  Recently, more sensitive detectors have become available, making the technique better suited to general use.  Raman microscopy of inorganic specimens, such as rocks and ceramics and polymers, can use a broader range of excitation wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ellis DI, Goodacre R |title=Metabolic fingerprinting in disease diagnosis: biomedical applications of infrared and Raman spectroscopy |journal=Analyst |volume=131 |issue=8 |pages=875–85 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=17028718 |doi=10.1039/b602376m |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b602376m}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using SRS Microscopy to Track Molecules at Video Rate==

Developed by researchers at Harvard, a new technique of SRS microscopy is based on stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and makes it possible to stream footage at the sub-cellular level, able to catch video of proteins, lipids, and water within cells.

Previous SRS microscopy could only capture about one image per minute, but the researchers at Harvard rearranged photodetectors to surround a small opening where a light beam is directed at the tissue under examination. This approach made it possible to collect almost 30% of the laser light directed at the tissue, more than 30 times what previous SRS microscopy could do.

SRS microscopy detects the intrinsic vibrations in chemical bonds between atoms and does not require fluorescent labeling. This new SRS microscopy may be a great compliment to MRI, which is more suited for imaging organs and other large objects within the body.

== Polarized analysis ==

The [[polarization]] of the Raman scattered light also contains useful information.  This property can be measured using (plane) polarized laser excitation and a [[polarizer|polarization analyzer]].  Spectra acquired with the analyzer set at both perpendicular and parallel to the excitation plane can be used to calculate the [[depolarization ratio]].  Study of the technique is pedagogically useful in teaching the connections between [[group theory]], symmetry, Raman activity and peaks in the corresponding Raman spectra.

The spectral information arising from this analysis gives insight into molecular orientation and vibrational symmetry.  In essence, it allows the user to obtain valuable information relating to the molecular shape, for example in synthetic chemistry or polymorph analysis.  It is often used to understand macromolecular orientation in crystal lattices, [[liquid crystal]]s or polymer samples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joseph M. Grzybowski, R. K. Khanna, E. R.

== Variations ==

Several variations of Raman spectroscopy have been developed.  The usual purpose is to enhance the sensitivity (e.g., surface-enhanced Raman), to improve the spatial resolution (Raman microscopy), or to acquire very specific information (resonance Raman).

* '''[[Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy]] (SERS)''' - Normally done in a silver or gold colloid or a substrate containing silver or gold.  Surface [[plasmons]] of silver and gold are excited by the laser, resulting in an increase in the electric fields surrounding the metal.  Given that Raman intensities are proportional to the electric field, there is large increase in the measured signal (by up to 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;).  This effect was originally observed by Fleishman but the prevailing explanation was proposed by Van Duyne in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Jeanmaire DL, van Duyne RP | title = Surface Raman Electrochemistry Part I.  Heterocyclic, Aromatic and Aliphatic Amines Adsorbed on the Anodized Silver Electrode |journal = Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry | volume = 84 | pages =1–20  | publisher = Elsevier Sequouia S.A. | year = 1977 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-0728(77)80224-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Hyper Raman''' - A [[non-linear optics|non-linear]] effect in which the vibrational modes interact with the [[second harmonic generation|second harmonic]] of the excitation beam.  This requires very high power, but allows the observation of vibrational modes which are normally &quot;silent&quot;.  It frequently relies on SERS-type enhancement to boost the sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kneipp K, ''et al'' | title=Surface-Enhanced Non-Linear Raman Scattering at the Single Molecule Level | journal = Chem. Phys. | volume = 247 | year = 1999 | pages = 155&amp;ndash;162 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Resonance Raman spectroscopy]]''' - The excitation wavelength is matched to an electronic transition of the molecule or crystal, so that vibrational modes associated with the excited electronic state are greatly enhanced.  This is useful for studying large molecules such as [[polypeptide]]s, which might show hundreds of bands in &quot;conventional&quot; Raman spectra.  It is also useful for associating normal modes with their observed frequency shifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Chao RS, Khanna RK, Lippincott ER | title = Theoretical and experimental resonance Raman intensities for the manganate ion| journal=J Raman Spectroscopy | year = 1974| doi = 10.1002/jrs.1250030203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Spontaneous Raman Spectroscopy''' - Used to study the temperature dependence of the Raman spectra of molecules.

* '''Optical Tweezers Raman Spectroscopy (OTRS)''' - Used to study individual particles, and even biochemical processes in single cells trapped by [[optical tweezers]].

* '''Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy''' - A two color pulse transfers the population from ground to a rovibrationally excited state, if the difference in energy corresponds to an allowed Raman transition.  Two photon UV ionization, applied after the population transfer but before relaxation, allows the intra-molecular or inter-molecular Raman spectrum of a gas or molecular cluster (indeed, a given conformation of molecular cluster) to be collected.  This is a useful molecular dynamics technique.

* '''Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy (SORS)''' - The Raman scatter is collected from regions laterally offset away from the excitation laser spot, leading to significantly lower contributions from the surface layer than with traditional Raman spectroscopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Matousek P, Clark IP, Draper ERC, ''et al'' | title = Subsurface Probing in Diffusely Scattering Media using Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy | journal = Applied Spectroscopy | volume = 59 | year = 2005 | pages = 393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy]] (CARS)''' - Two laser beams are used to generate a coherent anti-Stokes frequency beam, which can be enhanced by resonance.

* '''[[Raman optical activity]] (ROA)''' - Measures vibrational optical activity by means of a small difference in the intensity of Raman scattering from chiral molecules in right- and left-circularly polarized incident light or, equivalently, a small circularly polarized component in the scattered light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barron LD, Hecht L, McColl IH, Blanch EW| title = Raman optical activity comes of age | journal = Molec. Phys. | year=2004 | issue = 8 | pages = 731&amp;ndash744 | volume = 102 | doi=10.1080/00268970410001704399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Redshift.svg|thumb|upright|[[spectral line|Absorption lines]] in the [[visible spectrum|optical spectrum]] of a supercluster of distant galaxies (right), as compared to absorption lines in the optical spectrum of the Sun (left). Arrows indicate redshift. Wavelength increases up towards the red and beyond (frequency decreases).]]

In [[physics]] (especially the physics of [[astronomical objects]]), '''redshift''' happens when [[light]] seen coming from an object is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]]ally shifted to appear more red. Here, the term &quot;redder&quot; refers to what happens when [[Visible spectrum|visible light]] is shifted toward the red end of the visible spectrum. More generally, where an observer detects [[electromagnetic radiation]] [[electromagnetic spectrum|outside the visible spectrum]], &quot;redder&quot; amounts to a technical shorthand for &quot;increase in electromagnetic [[wavelength]]&quot; &amp;mdash; which also implies lower [[frequency]] and [[photon|photon energy]] in accord with, respectively, the [[Light#Wave theory|wave]] and [[Light#Quantum theory|quantum]] theories of light.

Redshifts are attributable to three different physical effects. The first discovered was the [[Doppler effect]], familiar in the changes in the apparent [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]es of sirens and [[frequency]] of the [[sound|sound waves]] emitted by speeding vehicles; an observed redshift due to the Doppler effect occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. [[Cosmology|Cosmological redshift]] is seen due to the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]], and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million [[light years]] away) show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase of their distance from Earth. Finally, [[gravitational redshift]]s are a [[general relativity|relativistic]] effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of [[gravitational field]]s. Conversely, a ''decrease'' in wavelength is called [[blue shift]] and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field. 

Although observing redshifts and blue shifts have several terrestrial applications (e.g., [[Doppler radar]] and [[radar gun]]s),&lt;ref&gt;See Feynman, Leighton and Sands (1989) or any introductory undergraduate (and many high school) [[Physics#Further reading|physics textbooks]]. See Taylor (1992) for a relativistic discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; redshifts are most famously seen in the [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] observations of astronomical objects.&lt;ref name=basicastronomy&gt;See Binney and Merrifeld (1998), Carroll and Ostlie (1996), Kutner (2003) for applications in astronomy.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[special relativity|special relativistic]] [[#Redshift formulae|redshift formula]] (and its [[classical physics|classical approximation]]) can be used to calculate the redshift of an object when [[spacetime]] is [[Minkowski space|flat]]. However, many cases such as [[black hole]]s and [[Big Bang cosmology]] require that redshifts be calculated using [[general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;See Misner, Thorne and Wheeler (1973) and Weinberg (1971) or any of the [[physical cosmology#Textbooks|physical cosmology textbooks]]&lt;/ref&gt; Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of [[Frame of reference|frame transformation laws]].  There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including [[scattering]] and [[physical optics|optical effects]]; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and not generally referred as such. (See section on [[#Effects due to physical optics or radiative transfer|physical optics and radiative transfer]]).

==History==
The history of the subject began with the development in the 19th century of [[wave mechanics]] and the exploration of phenomena associated with the [[Doppler effect]]. The effect is named after [[Christian Andreas Doppler]], who offered the first known physical explanation for the phenomenon in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Doppler, Christian, (1846), ''Prag, Druck von G. Haase sohne''&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis was tested and confirmed for [[sound|sound waves]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] scientist [[C.H.D. Buys Ballot|Christoph Hendrik Diederik Buys Ballot]] in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Dev Maulik, &quot;[http://books.google.com/books?id=HedeGJms0n4C&amp;vid=ISBN3540230882&amp;dq=%22Buys+Ballot%22&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;sig=1Y0ETpNemutmPYNF8KbWSbLrF7E&amp;q=%22Ballot%22 Doppler Sonography: A Brief History]&quot; in ''[http://www.springer.com/west/home/medicine/gynecology?SGWID=4-10066-22-46625046-0 Doppler Ultrasound in Obstetrics And Gynecology]'' (2005) by Dev (EDT) Maulik, Ivica Zalud&lt;/ref&gt; Doppler correctly predicted that the phenomenon should apply to all [[wave]]s, and in particular suggested that the varying [[color]]s of [[star]]s could be attributed to their motion with respect to the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Doppler}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this attribution turned out to be incorrect (stellar colors are indicators of a star's [[color temperature|temperature]], not motion), Doppler would later be vindicated by verified redshift observations.

The first Doppler redshift was described in 1848 by French physicist [[Hippolyte Fizeau|Armand-Hippolyte-Louis Fizeau]], who pointed to the shift in [[spectral line]]s seen in stars as being due to the Doppler effect. The effect is sometimes called the &quot;Doppler-Fizeau effect&quot;. In 1868, British astronomer [[William Huggins]] was the first to determine the velocity of a star moving away from the Earth by this method.&lt;ref name=Huggins&gt;William Huggins, &quot;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1868RSPT..158..529H&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c03088 Further Observations on the Spectra of Some of the Stars and Nebulae, with an Attempt to Determine Therefrom Whether These Bodies are Moving towards or from the Earth], Also Observations on the Spectra of the Sun and of Comet II.&quot; (1868) ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', Volume 158, pp. 529–564&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, optical redshift was confirmed when the phenomenon was observed in [[Fraunhofer lines]] using solar rotation, about 0.1 Å in the red.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, G., &quot;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1995Ap%26SS.227...93R&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=4521318e0222293 Intergalactic Plasma]&quot;(1995) Astrophysics and Space Science, v. 227, p. 93–96.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901 [[Aristarkh Apollonovich Belopolsky|Aristarkh Belopolsky]] verified optical redshift in the laboratory using a system of rotating mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Bélopolsky, A., &quot;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1901ApJ....13...15B&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=4521318e0220955 On an Apparatus for the Laboratory Demonstration of the Doppler-Fizeau Principle]&quot; (1901) Astrophysical Journal, vol. 13, p.15 &lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest occurrence of the term &quot;red-shift&quot; in print (in this hyphenated form), appears to be by American astronomer [[Walter S. Adams]] in 1908, where he mentions &quot;Two methods of investigating that nature of the nebular red-shift&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Walter S., &quot;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1908CMWCI..22....1A No. 22. Preliminary catalogue of lines affected in sun-spots]&quot; (1908) ''Contributions from the Mount Wilson Observatory'' / Carnegie Institution of Washington, vol. 22, pp.1–21&lt;/ref&gt; The word doesn't appear unhyphenated, perhaps indicating a more common usage of its German equivalent, ''Rotverschiebung'', until about 1934 by [[Willem de Sitter]].&lt;ref&gt;W. de Sitter, &quot;[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?journal=BAN&amp;year=1934&amp;volume=7&amp;page_ind=210&amp;letter=.&amp;type=SCREEN_GIF On distance, magnitude, and related quantities in an expanding universe], (1934) ''Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of the Netherlands'', Vol. 7, p.205. He writes: &quot;It thus becomes urgent to investigate the effect of the redshift and of the metric of the universe on the apparent magnitude and observed numbers of nebulae of given magnitude&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with observations in 1912, [[Vesto Slipher]] discovered that most [[spiral nebula]]e had considerable redshifts.&lt;ref&gt;Slipher first reports on his measurement in the inaugural volume of the Lowell Observatory Bulletin, pp.2.56-2.57 [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1913LowOB...1b..56S&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=448f04e38822894]. His article entitled ''The radial velocity of the Andromeda Nebula'' reports making the first Doppler measurement on September 17, 1912. In his report, Slipher writes: &quot;The magnitude of this velocity, which is the greatest hitherto observed, raises the question whether the velocity-like displacement might not be due to some other cause, but I believe we have at present no other interpretation for it.&quot; Three years later, in the journal ''Popular Astronomy'', Vol. 23, p. 21–24 [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1915PA.....23...21S&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=448f04e38822894], Slipher wrote a review entitled ''Spectrographic Observations of Nebulae''. In it he states, &quot;The early discovery that the great Andromeda spiral had the quite exceptional velocity of - 300 km(/s) showed the means then available, capable of investigating not only the spectra of the spirals but their velocities as well.&quot; Slipher reported the velocities for 15 spiral nebulae spread across the entire [[celestial sphere]], all but three having observable &quot;positive&quot; (that is recessional) velocities.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[Edwin Hubble]] discovered an approximate relationship between the redshift of such &quot;nebulae&quot; (now known to be [[galaxy|galaxies]] in their own right) and the [[distance]] to them with the formulation of his eponymous [[Hubble's law]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubble, Edwin, &quot;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1929PNAS...15..168H&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c30954 A Relation between Distance and Radial Velocity among Extra-Galactic Nebulae]&quot; (1929) ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', Volume 15, Issue 3, pp. 168–173 ([http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/15/3/168 Full article], PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; These observations corroborated [[Alexander Friedman]]'s 1922 work, in which he derived the famous [[Friedmann equations]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, A: Über die Krümmung des Raumes, Z. Phys. 10 (1922), 377–386. (English translation in: Gen. Rel. Grav. 31 (1999), 1991–2000.)&lt;/ref&gt; They are today considered strong evidence for an [[expanding universe]] and the [[Big Bang]] theory.&lt;ref name=Eddington&gt;This was recognized early on by physicists and astronomers working in cosmology in the 1930s. The earliest layman publication describing the details of this correspondence was [[Sir Arthur Eddington]]'s book ''The Expanding Universe: Astronomy's 'Great Debate', 1900–1931'', published by Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge in 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement, characterization, and interpretation==
The [[visible spectrum|spectrum]] of light that comes from a single source (see idealized spectrum illustration top-right) can be measured. To determine the redshift, one searches for features in the spectrum such as [[spectral line|absorption lines]], [[spectral line|emission lines]], or other variations in [[light intensity]]. If found, these features can be compared with known features in the spectrum of various chemical compounds found in experiments where that compound is located on earth. A very common [[chemical element|atomic element]] in space is [[hydrogen]]. The spectrum of originally featureless light shone through hydrogen will show a [[hydrogen spectrum|signature spectrum]] specific to hydrogen that has features at regular intervals. If restricted to absorption lines it would look similar to the illustration (top right). If the same pattern of intervals is seen in an observed spectrum from a distant source but occurring at shifted wavelengths, it can be identified as hydrogen too. If the same spectral line is identified in both spectra but at different wavelengths then the redshift can be calculated using the table below. Determining the redshift of an object in this way requires a frequency- or wavelength-range. In order to calculate the redshift one has to know the wavelength of the emitted light in the rest frame of the source, in other words, the wavelength that would be measured by an observer located adjacent to and comoving with the source. Since in astronomical applications this measurement cannot be done directly, because that would require travelling to the distant star of interest, the method using spectral lines described here is used instead. Redshifts cannot be calculated by looking at unidentified features whose rest-frame frequency is unknown, or with a spectrum that is featureless or [[white noise]] (random fluctuations in a spectrum).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, this 25 May 2004 [http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/about_swift/redshift.html press release] from [[NASA]]'s [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]] [[space telescope]] that is researching [[gamma-ray burst]]s: &quot;Measurements of the gamma-ray spectra obtained during the main outburst of the GRB have found little value as redshift indicators, due to the lack of well-defined features. However, optical observations of GRB afterglows have produced spectra with identifiable lines, leading to precise redshift measurements.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Redshift (and blue shift) may be characterized by the relative difference between the observed and emitted wavelengths (or frequency) of an object. In astronomy, it is customary to refer to this change using a [[dimensionless]] quantity called ''z''. If ''λ'' represents wavelength and ''f'' represents frequency (note, ''λf'' = ''c'' where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]), then ''z'' is defined by the equations:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; align=center
|+ '''Calculation of redshift, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;'''
! '''Based on wavelength''' !! '''Based on frequency'''
|- align=center
| &lt;math&gt;z = \frac{\lambda_{\mathrm{obsv}} - \lambda_{\mathrm{emit}}}{\lambda_{\mathrm{emit}}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;z = \frac{f_{\mathrm{emit}} - f_{\mathrm{obsv}}}{f_{\mathrm{obsv}}}&lt;/math&gt;
|- align=center
| &lt;math&gt;1+z = \frac{\lambda_{\mathrm{obsv}}}{\lambda_{\mathrm{emit}}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;1+z = \frac{f_{\mathrm{emit}}}{f_{\mathrm{obsv}}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

After ''z'' is measured, the distinction between redshift and blue shift is simply a matter of whether ''z'' is positive or negative. See the [[#Redshift forumlas|formulae section]] below for some basic interpretations that follow when either a redshift or blue shift is observed. For example, [[Doppler effect]] blue shifts (''z'' &lt; 0) are associated with objects approaching (moving closer to) the observer with the light shifting to greater [[energy|energies]]. Conversely, Doppler effect redshifts (''z'' &gt; 0) are associated with objects receding (moving away) from the observer with the light shifting to lower energies. Likewise, gravitational blue shifts are associated with light emitted from a source residing within a weaker [[gravitational field]] observed within a stronger [[gravitational field]], while gravitational redshifting implies the opposite conditions.

==Redshift formulae==
In general relativity one can derive several important special-case formulae for redshift in certain special spacetime geometries, as summarized in the following table. In all cases the magnitude of the shift (the value of ''z'') is independent of the wavelength.&lt;ref name=basicastronomy /&gt;
[[Image:Suzredshift.gif|thumb|Doppler effect, [[yellow]] (~575 [[nanometer|nm]] wavelength) ball appears [[green]]ish (blueshift to ~565 nm wavelength) approaching observer, turns [[Orange (colour)|orange]] (redshift to ~585 nm wavelength) as it passes, and returns to yellow when motion stops. To observe such a change in color, the object would have to be traveling at approximately 5200 [[kilometer per second|km/s]], or about 75 times faster than the speed record for the [[Helios II|fastest manmade space probe]].]]

===Doppler effect===
{{main|Doppler effect}}
If a source of the light is moving away from an observer, then redshift (''z'' &gt; 0) occurs; if the source moves towards the observer, then [[blue shift]] (''z'' &lt; 0) occurs. This is true for all electromagnetic waves and is explained by the [[Doppler effect]]. Consequently, this type of redshift is called the ''Doppler redshift''. If the source moves away from the observer with [[velocity]] ''v'', which is much less than the speed of light (v &lt;&lt; c), the redshift is given by

:&lt;math&gt;z \approx \frac{v}{c}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (Since &lt;math&gt;\gamma \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;, [[#Relativistic Doppler effect|see below]])

where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. In the classical Doppler effect, the frequency of the source is not modified, but the recessional motion causes the illusion of a lower frequency.

===Relativistic Doppler effect===
{{main|Relativistic Doppler effect}}
A more complete treatment of the Doppler redshift requires considering relativistic effects associated with motion of sources close to the speed of light. A complete derivation of the effect can be found in the article on the [[relativistic Doppler effect]]. In brief, objects moving close to the speed of light will experience deviations from the above formula due to the [[time dilation]] of [[special relativity]] which can be corrected for by introducing the [[Lorentz factor]] ''γ'' into the classical Doppler formula as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;1 + z = \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right) \gamma&lt;/math&gt;

This phenomenon was first observed in a 1938 experiment performed by Herbert E. Ives and G.R. Stilwell, called the [[Ives-Stilwell experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Ives and G.

Since the Lorentz factor is dependent only on the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the velocity, this causes the redshift associated with the relativistic correction to be independent of the orientation of the source movement. In contrast, the classical part of the formula is dependent on the [[scalar resolute|projection]] of the movement of the source into the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] which yields different results for different orientations. Consequently, for an object moving at an angle ''θ'' to the observer (zero angle is directly away from the observer), the full form for the relativistic Doppler effect becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;1+ z = \frac{1 + v \cos (\theta)/c}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

and for motion solely in the line of sight (θ = 0°), this equation reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt;1 + z = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \frac{v}{c}}{1 - \frac{v}{c}}}&lt;/math&gt;

For the special case that the source is moving at [[right angle]]s (θ = 90°) to the detector, the relativistic redshift is known as the [[Transverse Doppler effect|transverse redshift]], and a redshift:

:&lt;math&gt;1 + z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

is measured, even though the object is not moving away from the observer. Even if the source is moving towards the observer, if there is a transverse component to the motion then there is some speed at which the dilation just cancels the expected blue shift and at higher speed the approaching source will be redshifted.&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;[http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/people/ross/phys2100/doppler.htm Photons, Relativity, Doppler shift]&quot; at the University of Queensland&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion of space===
{{main|Metric expansion of space}}
In the early part of the twentieth century, Slipher, Hubble and others made the first measurements of the redshifts and blue shifts of galaxies beyond the [[Milky Way]]. They initially interpreted these redshifts and blue shifts as due solely to the Doppler effect, but later Hubble discovered a rough correlation between the increasing redshifts and the increasing distance of galaxies. Theorists almost immediately realized that these observations could be explained by a different mechanism for producing redshifts. [[Hubble's law]] of the correlation between redshifts and distances is required by models of cosmology derived from general relativity that have a [[metric expansion of space]].&lt;ref name=Eddington /&gt; As a result, photons propagating through the expanding space are stretched, creating the [[cosmological redshift]].

====Difference from a Doppler effect====

This differs from a Doppler-effect redshift because it is not a consequence of the speed of the source; instead, the photons increase in wavelength and redshift as the space through which they are traveling expands.&lt;ref name=Harrison1&gt;The distinction is made clear in {{cite book |author=Edward Robert Harrison |year= 2000 |title=Cosmology: The Science of the Universe  |publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition=2 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-8PJbcA2lLoC&amp;pg=PA315#PPA306,M1 |pages=306''ff'' |isbn=052166148X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a universe in which space expands at an accelerating rate, the distance between remote galaxies will eventually increase at more than 3{{e|8}} m/s, but this does not imply that the galaxies themselves exceed the speed of light.

====The red shift in cosmological models====

The observational consequences of this effect can be derived using [[Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric|the equations]] from [[general relativity]] that describe a [[cosmological principle|homogeneous and isotropic universe]].

To derive the redshift effect, use the [[geodesic equation]] for a light wave, which is

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2=0=-c^2dt^2+\frac{a^2 dr^2}{1-kr^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where

*&lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt; is the Lorentzian [[line element]]
*&lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt; is the time interval
*&lt;math&gt;dr&lt;/math&gt; is the spatial interval
*&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light
*&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the time-dependent cosmic [[scale factor (Universe)|scale factor]] or [[Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric|Robertson-Walker scale factor]]
*&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[curvature]] per unit area.

For an observer observing the crest of a light wave at a position &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt; and time &lt;math&gt;t=t_\mathrm{now}&lt;/math&gt;, the crest of the light wave was emitted at a time &lt;math&gt;t=t_\mathrm{then}&lt;/math&gt; in the past and a distant position &lt;math&gt;r=R&lt;/math&gt;. Integrating over the path in both space and time that the light wave travels yields:

:&lt;math&gt;
c \int_{t_\mathrm{then}}^{t_\mathrm{now}} \frac{dt}{a}\; = 
    \int_{R}^{0} \frac{dr}{\sqrt{1-kr^2}}\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the wavelength of light is not the same for the two positions and times considered due to the changing properties of the metric. When the wave was emitted, it had a wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\mathrm{then}&lt;/math&gt;. The next crest of the light wave was emitted at a time

:&lt;math&gt;t=t_\mathrm{then}+\lambda_\mathrm{then}/c\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The observer sees the next crest of the observed light wave with a wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\mathrm{now}&lt;/math&gt; to arrive at a time

:&lt;math&gt;t=t_\mathrm{now}+\lambda_\mathrm{now}/c\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the subsequent crest is again emitted from &lt;math&gt;r=R&lt;/math&gt; and is observed at &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt;, the following equation can be written:

:&lt;math&gt;
c \int_{t_\mathrm{then}+\lambda_\mathrm{then}/c}^{t_\mathrm{now}+\lambda_\mathrm{now}/c} \frac{dt}{a}\; = 
    \int_{R}^{0} \frac{dr}{\sqrt{1-kr^2}}\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

The right-hand side of the two integral equations above are identical which means

:&lt;math&gt;
c \int_{t_\mathrm{then}+\lambda_\mathrm{then}/c}^{t_\mathrm{now}+\lambda_\mathrm{now}/c} \frac{dt}{a}\; =
c \int_{t_\mathrm{then}}^{t_\mathrm{now}} \frac{dt}{a}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

or, alternatively,

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{t_\mathrm{now}}^{t_\mathrm{now}+\lambda_\mathrm{now}/c} \frac{dt}{a}\; =
\int_{t_\mathrm{then}}^{t_\mathrm{then}+\lambda_\mathrm{then}/c} \frac{dt}{a}\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

For very small variations in time (over the period of one cycle of a light wave) the scale factor is essentially a constant (&lt;math&gt;a=a_\mathrm{now}&lt;/math&gt; today and &lt;math&gt;a=a_\mathrm{then}&lt;/math&gt; previously). This yields

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{t_\mathrm{now}+\lambda_\mathrm{now}/c}{a_\mathrm{now}}-\frac{t_\mathrm{now}}{a_\mathrm{now}}\; = \frac{t_\mathrm{then}+\lambda_\mathrm{then}/c}{a_\mathrm{then}}-\frac{t_\mathrm{then}}{a_\mathrm{then}}
&lt;/math&gt;

which can be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda_\mathrm{now}}{\lambda_\mathrm{then}}=\frac{a_\mathrm{now}}{a_\mathrm{then}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the definition of redshift provided [[#Measurement, characterization, and interpretation|above]], the equation

:&lt;math&gt;1+z = \frac{a_\mathrm{now}}{a_\mathrm{then}}&lt;/math&gt;

is obtained. In an expanding universe such as the one we inhabit, the scale factor is [[monotonic function|monotonically increasing]] as time passes, thus, z is positive and distant galaxies appear redshifted.

Using a model of the expansion of the universe, redshift can be related to the age of an observed object, the so-called ''[[cosmic time]]–redshift relation''. Denote a density ratio as Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:

[[File:Two redshifts.JPG|thumb |350px |Two different sources of redshift: ''Top, Doppler shift'': the star moving to the left emits light that is blue shifted in the direction of the receiving antenna that the star approaches, and red shifted in the direction of the receiving antenna that the star is leaving.

====Cosmological and Doppler red shifts====

For cosmological redshifts of z &lt; 0.01 the effects of [[spacetime]] expansion are minimal and cosmological redshifts can be dominated by additional Doppler redshifts and blue shifts caused by the peculiar motions of the galaxies relative to one another.&lt;ref&gt;Measurements of the peculiar velocities out to 5 [[parsec|Mpc]] using the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] were reported in 2003 by Karachentsev et al. ''Local galaxy flows within 5 Mpc''. 02/2003 ''[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]]'', '''398''', 479-491.[http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0211011]&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between physical velocity and space expansion can be illustrated by the [[Metric expansion of space#Other models of expansion|Expanding Rubber Sheet Universe]], a common cosmological analogy used to describe the expansion of space. If two objects are represented by ball bearings and spacetime by a stretching rubber sheet, the Doppler effect is caused by rolling the balls across the sheet to create peculiar motion. The cosmological redshift occurs when the ball bearings are stuck to the sheet and the sheet is stretched.

The redshifts of galaxies include both a component related to recessional velocity from expansion of the universe, and a component related to [[peculiar motion]] (Doppler shift). The redshift due to expansion of the universe depends upon the recessional velocity in a fashion determined by the cosmological model chosen to describe the expansion of the universe, which is very different from how Doppler redshift depends upon local velocity. Harrison provides a summary of this and related distinctions.&lt;ref name=Harrison2&gt;{{cite journal |title=The redshift-distance and velocity-distance laws |author=Edward Harrison |year=1992 |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ApJ...403...28H |journal=Astrophysical Journal, Part 1 |pages=28–31 |volume=403 |doi=10.1086/172179}}. A pdf file can be found [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1993ApJ...403...28H&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf  here].&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the cosmological expansion origin of redshift, Harrison says: “Light leaves a galaxy, which is stationary in its local region of space, and is eventually received by observers who are stationary in their own local region of space. Between the galaxy and the observer, light travels through vast regions of expanding space. As a result, all wavelengths of the light are stretched by the expansion of space. It is as simple as that.” See Harrison, p. 315.&lt;ref name=Harrison1/&gt; “The increase of wavelength from emission to absorption of light does not depend on the rate of change of ''a(t)'' [here ''a(t)'' is the [[Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric|Robertson-Walker scale factor]]] at the times of emission or absorption, but on the increase of ''a(t)'' in the whole period from emission to absorption.”&lt;ref name=Weinberg_Cosmology&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=48C-ym2EmZkC&amp;pg=PA11 |author=Steven Weinberg |title=Cosmology |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=11 |year=2008 |isbn=9780198526827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, popular literature often uses the expression &quot;Doppler redshift&quot; instead of &quot;cosmological redshift&quot; to describe the redshift of galaxies dominated by the expansion of spacetime, despite the fact that the redshift is not found using the relativistic Doppler equation.&lt;ref&gt;Odenwald &amp; Fienberg 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Doppler redshift is bound by [[special relativity]]; thus ''v &gt; c'' is impossible while, in contrast, ''v &gt; c'' is possible for cosmological redshift because the space which separates the objects (for example, a quasar from the Earth) can expand faster than the speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;Speed faster than light is allowed because the [[metric expansion of space|expansion]] of the [[spacetime]] [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] is described by [[general relativity]] in terms of sequences of only locally valid inertial frames as opposed to a global [[Minkowski metric]]. Expansion faster than light is an integrated effect over many local inertial frames and is allowed because no single inertial frame is involved. The speed-of-light limitation applies only locally. See {{cite journal |author=Michal Chodorowski  |title=Is space really expanding? A counterexample |year=2007 |url=http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0601171v2 |journal=Concepts Phys |volume=4 |pages=17–34}} &lt;/ref&gt; More mathematically, the viewpoint that &quot;distant galaxies are receding&quot; and the viewpoint that &quot;the space between galaxies is expanding&quot; are related by changing [[coordinate system]]s. Expressing this precisely requires working with the mathematics of the [[Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Weiss, What Causes the Hubble Redshift?, entry in the Physics [[FAQ]] (1994), available via [[John Baez]]'s [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/hubble.html website]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blue shift in a contracting universe====

If the universe were contracting instead of expanding, we would see distant galaxies blue shifted by an amount proportional to their distance instead of redshifted.&lt;ref&gt;This is only true in a universe where there are no [[peculiar velocity|peculiar velocities]]. Otherwise, redshifts combine as
:&lt;math&gt;1+z=(1+z_{\mathrm{Doppler}})(1+z_{\mathrm{expansion}})&lt;/math&gt;
which yields solutions where certain objects that &quot;recede&quot; are blue shifted and other objects that &quot;approach&quot; are redshifted. For more on this bizarre result see Davis, T. M., Lineweaver, C. H., and Webb, J. K. &quot;[http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0104349/ Solutions to the tethered galaxy problem in an expanding universe and the observation of receding blue shifted objects]&quot;, ''[[American Journal of Physics]]'' (2003), '''71''' 358–364.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gravitational redshift===
{{main|Gravitational redshift}}
In the theory of [[general relativity]], there is time dilation within a gravitational well. This is known as the [[gravitational redshift]] or ''Einstein Shift''.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Chant, C. A., &quot;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1930JRASC..24..390C&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c27309 Notes and Queries (Telescopes and Observatory Equipment-The Einstein Shift of Solar Lines)]&quot; (1930) ''Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada'', Vol. 24, p.390&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical derivation of this effect follows from the [[Schwarzschild solution]] of the [[Einstein field equations|Einstein equations]] which yields the following formula for redshift associated with a photon traveling in the [[gravitational field]] of an [[electrical charge|uncharged]], [[rotation|nonrotating]], [[spherical symmetry|spherically symmetric]] mass:

:&lt;math&gt;1+z=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)}},&lt;/math&gt; 

where
* &lt;math&gt;G\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]],
* &lt;math&gt;M\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mass]] of the object creating the gravitational field,
* &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; is the radial coordinate of the source (which is analogous to the classical distance from the center of the object, but is actually a [[Schwarzschild coordinates|Schwarzschild coordinate]]), and
* &lt;math&gt;c\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]].

This gravitational redshift result can be derived from the assumptions of [[special relativity]] and the [[equivalence principle]]; the full theory of general relativity is not required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Einstein | first = A | authorlink = Albert Einstein | year = 1907 | title = Unknown title | journal = Jahrbuch der Radioaktivität und Elektronik | volume = 4 | pages = 411&amp;ndash;?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect is very small but measurable on Earth using the [[Mössbauer effect]] and was first observed in the [[Pound-Rebka experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;R. V. Pound and G. A. Rebka Jr., Apparent weight of photons, ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' '''4''', 337 (1960). [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v4/i7/p337_1] This paper was the first measurement.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is significant near a [[black hole]], and as an object approaches the [[event horizon]] the red shift becomes infinite. It is also the dominant cause of large angular-scale temperature fluctuations in the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (see [[Sachs-Wolfe effect]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sachs | first = R. K. | authorlink = Rainer Kurt Sachs|coauthors = [[Arthur Michael Wolfe|Wolfe, A. M.]] | year = 1967 | title = ''Perturbations of a cosmological model and angular variations of the cosmic microwave background'' | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 147 | issue = 73 | doi = 10.1086/148982 | pages = 73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations in astronomy==
The redshift observed in astronomy can be measured because the [[emission spectrum|emission]] and [[absorption spectrum|absorption]] spectra for [[atom]]s are distinctive and well known, calibrated from [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic experiments]] in [[laboratory|laboratories]] on Earth. When the redshift of various absorption and emission lines from a single astronomical object is measured, ''z'' is found to be remarkably constant. Although distant objects may be slightly blurred and lines broadened, it is by no more than can be explained by [[thermal motion|thermal]] or [[motion (physics)|mechanical motion]] of the source. For these reasons and others, the consensus among astronomers is that the redshifts they observe are due to some combination of the three established forms of Doppler-like redshifts.  Alternative hypotheses and explanations for redshift such as [[tired light]] are not generally considered plausible.&lt;ref name=reboul&gt; When cosmological redshifts were first discovered, [[Fritz Zwicky]] proposed an effect known as tired light. While usually considered for historical interests, it is sometimes, along with [[intrinsic redshift]] suggestions, utilized by [[nonstandard cosmologies]]. In 1981, H. J. Reboul summarised many [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1981A%26AS...45..129R&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=42ca922c9c23806 alternative redshift mechanisms] that had been discussed in the literature since the 1930s. In 2001, [[Geoffrey Burbidge]] remarked in a [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2001PASP..113..899B&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML review] that the wider astronomical community has marginalized such discussions since the 1960s. Burbidge and [[Halton Arp]], while investigating the mystery of [[Quasar#History of quasar observation|the nature of quasars]], tried to develop alternative redshift mechanisms, and very few of their fellow scientists acknowledged let alone accepted their work. Moreover, Goldhaber ''et al.'' 2001; &quot;Timescale Stretch Parameterization of Type Ia Supernova B-Band Lightcurves&quot;, ApJ, 558:359-386, 2001 September 1 pointed out that alternative theories are unable to account for timescale stretch observed in [[type Ia supernovae]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spectroscopy, as a measurement, is considerably more difficult than simple [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]], which measures the [[brightness]] of astronomical objects through certain [[filter (optics)|filter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For a review of the subject of photometry, consider Budding, E., ''Introduction to Astronomical Photometry'', Cambridge University Press (September 24, 1993), ISBN 0-521-41867-4&lt;/ref&gt; When photometric data is all that is available (for example, the [[Hubble Deep Field]] and the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]]), astronomers rely on a technique for measuring [[photometric redshift]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The technique was first described by Baum, W. A.: 1962, in G. C. McVittie (ed.), ''Problems of extra-galactic research'', p. 390, IAU Symposium No. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the filter being sensitive to a range of wavelengths and the technique relying on making many assumptions about the nature of the spectrum at the light-source, [[observational error|error]]s for these sorts of measurements can range up to δ''z'' = 0.5, and are much less reliable than spectroscopic determinations.&lt;ref&gt;Bolzonella, M.; Miralles, J.-M.; Pelló, R., [http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0003380 Photometric redshifts based on standard SED fitting procedures], ''[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]]'', '''363''', p.476–492 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; However, photometry does allow at least for a qualitative characterization of a redshift. For example, if a sun-like spectrum had a redshift of ''z'' = 1, it would be brightest in the [[infrared]] rather than at the yellow-green color associated with the peak of its [[blackbody spectrum]], and the light intensity will be reduced in the filter by a factor of two (1+''z'') (see [[K correction]] for more details on the photometric consequences of redshift).&lt;ref&gt;A pedagogical overview of the K-correction by David Hogg and other members of the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] collaboration can be found at [http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210394 astro-ph].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local observations===

In nearby objects (within our [[Milky Way]] galaxy) observed redshifts are almost always related to the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] velocities associated with the objects being observed. Observations of such redshifts and blue shifts have enabled astronomers to measure [[velocity|velocities]] and parametrize the [[mass]]es of the [[orbit (celestial mechanics)|orbiting]] [[star]]s in [[Binary star#Spectroscopic binaries|spectroscopic binaries]], a method first employed in 1868 by British astronomer [[William Huggins]].&lt;ref name=Huggins /&gt; Similarly, small redshifts and blue shifts detected in the spectroscopic measurements of individual stars are one way astronomers have been able to [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Radial velocity|diagnose and measure]] the presence and characteristics of [[extrasolar planet|planetary systems]] around other stars and have even made very [[Rossiter-McLaughlin effect|detailed differential measurements]] of redshifts during [[Methods_of_detecting_extrasolar_planets#Transit_method|planetary transits]] to determine precise orbital parameters.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Exoplanet Tracker]] is the newest observing project to use this technique, able to track the redshift variations in multiple objects at once, as reported in Ge, Jian et al.

===Extragalactic observations===
The most distant objects exhibit larger redshifts corresponding to the [[Hubble's law|Hubble flow]] of the universe. The largest observed redshift, corresponding to the greatest distance and furthest back in time, is that of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]; the numerical value of its redshift is about {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} 1089}} ({{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} 0}} corresponds to present time), and it shows the state of the [[Universe]] about 13.7 billion years ago, and 379,000 years after the initial moments of the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref&gt;An accurate measurement of the cosmic microwave background was achieved by the [[COBE]] experiment. The final published temperature of 2.73 K was reported in this paper: Fixsen, D. J.; Cheng, E. S.; Cottingham, D. A.; Eplee, R. E., Jr.; Isaacman, R. B.; Mather, J. C.; Meyer, S. S.; Noerdlinger, P. D.; Shafer, R. A.; Weiss, R.; Wright, E. L.; Bennett, C. L.; Boggess, N. W.; Kelsall, T.; Moseley, S. H.; Silverberg, R. F.; Smoot, G. F.; Wilkinson, D. T.. (1994). &quot;Cosmic microwave background dipole spectrum measured by the COBE FIRAS instrument&quot;, ''Astrophysical Journal'', 420, 445. The most accurate measurement as of 2006 was achieved by the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] experiment.&lt;/ref&gt;

The luminous point-like cores of [[quasar]]s were the first &quot;high-redshift&quot; ({{nowrap|''z'' &gt; 0.1}}) objects discovered before the improvement of telescopes allowed for the discovery of other high-redshift galaxies.

For galaxies more distant than the [[Local Group]] and the nearby [[Virgo Cluster]], but within a thousand [[parsec|megaparsecs]] or so, the redshift is approximately proportional to the galaxy's distance. This correlation was first observed by [[Edwin Hubble]] and has come to be known as [[Hubble's law]]. [[Vesto Slipher]] was the first to discover galactic redshifts, in about the year 1912, while Hubble correlated Slipher's measurements with distances he [[cosmic distance ladder|measured by other means]] to formulate his Law. In the widely accepted cosmological model based on [[general relativity]], redshift is mainly a result of the expansion of space: this means that the farther away a galaxy is from us, the more the space has expanded in the time since the light left that galaxy, so the more the light has been stretched, the more redshifted the light is, and so the faster it appears to be moving away from us. [[Hubble's law]] follows in part from the [[Copernican principle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peebles-1993&quot;&gt;Peebles (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is usually not known how [[luminosity|luminous]] objects are, measuring the redshift is easier than more direct distance measurements, so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble's law.

[[Gravitation|Gravitational interactions]] of galaxies with each other and clusters cause a significant [[variance|scatter]] in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram. The [[peculiar velocity|peculiar velocities]] associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace of the [[mass]] of [[virial theorem|virialized objects]] in the universe. This effect leads to such phenomena as nearby galaxies (such as the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]) exhibiting blue shifts as we fall towards a common [[barycenter]], and redshift maps of clusters showing a [[Fingers of God|Finger of God]] effect due to the scatter of peculiar velocities in a roughly spherical distribution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peebles-1993&quot;/&gt; This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent of the ''[[mass to light ratio]]'' (the ratio of a galaxy's mass in solar masses to its brightness in solar luminosities), an important tool for measuring [[dark matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James|last=Binney|coauthors=and Scott Treimane|title=Galactic dynamics|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-08445-9|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hubble law's linear relationship between distance and redshift assumes that the rate of expansion of the universe is constant. However, when the universe was much younger, the expansion rate, and thus the Hubble &quot;constant&quot;, was larger than it is today. For more distant galaxies, then, whose light has been travelling to us for much longer times, the approximation of constant expansion rate fails, and the Hubble law becomes a non-linear integral relationship and dependent on the history of the expansion rate since the emission of the light from the galaxy in question. Observations of the redshift-distance relationship can be used, then, to determine the expansion history of the universe and thus the matter and energy content.

While it was long believed that the expansion rate has been continuously decreasing since the Big Bang, recent observations of the redshift-distance relationship using [[Type Ia supernova]]e have suggested that in comparatively recent times the expansion rate of the universe has [[Accelerating universe|begun to accelerate]].

===Highest redshifts===
Currently, the objects with the highest known redshifts are galaxies and the objects producing gamma ray bursts. The most reliable redshifts are from [[spectroscopic]] data, and the highest confirmed [[spectroscopic]] redshift of a galaxy is that of [[IOK-1]],&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal

''Extremely red objects'' (EROs) are astronomical sources of radiation that radiate energy in the red and near infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. These may be starburst galaxies that have  a high redshift accompanied by reddening from intervening dust, or they could be highly redshifted elliptical galaxies with an older (and therefore redder) stellar population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] has a redshift of more than 1,000, corresponding to an age of approximately 379,000 years after the Big Bang and a current [[comoving distance]] of more than 46 billion light years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ly93&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Lineweaver | first = Charles | coauthors = Tamara M.

===Redshift surveys===
[[Image:2dfgrs.png|left|thumb|300px|Rendering of the 2dFGRS data]]

With the advent of automated [[telescope]]s and improvements in [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopes]], a number of collaborations have been made to map the universe in redshift space. By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky. These observations are used to measure properties of the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|large-scale structure]] of the universe. The [[Great Wall (astronomy)|Great Wall]], a vast [[supercluster]] of galaxies over 500 million [[light-year]]s wide, provides a dramatic example of a large-scale structure that redshift surveys can detect.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Geller &amp; J. P. Huchra, ''Science'' '''246''', 897 (1989). [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/246/4932/897 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first redshift survey was the [[CfA Redshift Survey]], started in 1977 with the initial data collection completed in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;See the official CfA [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~huchra/zcat/ website] for more details.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]] determined the large-scale structure of one section of the Universe, measuring ''z''-values for over 220,000 galaxies; data collection was completed in 2002, and the final [[data set]] was released 30 June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|title=The 2dF galaxy redshift survey: Power-spectrum analysis of the final dataset and cosmological implications|author=Shaun Cole ''et al.''

Another notable investigation, the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (SDSS), is ongoing as of 2005 and aims to obtain measurements on around 100 million objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdss.org/ SDSS Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; SDSS has recorded redshifts for galaxies as high as 0.4, and has been involved in the detection of [[quasar]]s beyond ''z'' = 6. The [[DEEP2 Redshift Survey]] uses the [[Keck telescopes]] with the new &quot;DEIMOS&quot; [[spectrograph]]; a follow-up to the pilot program DEEP1, DEEP2 is designed to measure faint galaxies with redshifts 0.7 and above, and it is therefore planned to provide a complement to SDSS and 2dF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Science objectives and early results of the DEEP2 redshift survey|author=Marc Davis ''et al.''

==Effects due to physical optics or radiative transfer==
The interactions and phenomena summarized in the subjects of [[radiative transfer]] and [[physical optics]] can result in shifts in the wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic radiation. In such cases the shifts correspond to a physical energy transfer to matter or other photons rather than being due to a transformation between reference frames. These shifts can be due to such physical phenomena as [[Wolf effect|coherence effects]] or the [[scattering]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] whether from [[electric charge|charged]] [[elementary particle]]s, from particulates, or from fluctuations of the [[index of refraction]] in a [[dielectric medium]] as occurs in the radio phenomenon of [[Whistler (radio)|radio whistlers]].&lt;ref name=basicastronomy /&gt; While such phenomena are sometimes referred to as &quot;redshifts&quot; and &quot;blue shifts&quot;, in astrophysics light-matter interactions that result in energy shifts in the radiation field are generally referred to as &quot;reddening&quot; rather than &quot;redshifting&quot; which, as a term, is normally reserved for the [[#Redshift formulae|effects discussed above]].&lt;ref name=basicastronomy /&gt;

In many circumstances scattering causes radiation to redden because [[entropy]] results in the predominance of many low-[[energy]] photons over few high-energy ones (while [[conservation of energy|conserving total energy]]).&lt;ref name=basicastronomy /&gt; Except possibly under carefully controlled conditions, scattering does not produce the same relative change in wavelength across the whole spectrum; that is, any calculated ''z'' is generally a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of wavelength. Furthermore, scattering from [[randomness|random]] [[matter|media]] generally occurs at many [[angle]]s, and ''z'' is a function of the scattering angle. If multiple scattering occurs, or the scattering particles have relative motion, then there is generally distortion of [[spectral line]]s as well.&lt;ref name=basicastronomy /&gt;

In [[interstellar medium|interstellar astronomy]], [[visible spectrum|visible spectra]] can appear [[red]]der due to scattering processes in a phenomenon referred to as [[interstellar reddening]]&lt;ref name=basicastronomy /&gt; — similarly [[Rayleigh scattering]] causes the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] reddening of the [[Sun]] seen in the [[sunrise]] or [[sunset]] and causes the rest of the [[sky]] to have a [[blue]] color. This phenomenon is distinct from red''shift''ing because the [[atomic spectral line|spectroscopic lines]] are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional [[extinction (astronomy)|dimming]] and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered in and out of the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]].

[[Image:Reflectron.jpg|thumb||right|400 px|Lens stack from a reflectron mass spectrometer. The metal plates carry the voltages and form the electric field that reflects ions.]]
A '''reflectron''' (also known as an '''ion mirror''') is a type of [[time-of-flight mass spectrometer]] that uses a static [[electric field]] to reverse the direction of travel of the [[ion]]s entering it. A reflectron improves mass [[resolution]] by assuring that ions of the same ''[[m/z]]'' but different [[kinetic energy]] arrive at the detector at the same time. The reflectron was invented by the Russian scientist [[Boris Aleksandrovich Mamyrin]] in 1973.

A single stage reflectron is composed of a single electric field region. The field can be [[linear]] or [[non-linear]].

A curved-field reflectron is one in which the retarding field is non-linear and the voltages on the lens elements follow the equation of an arc of a [[circle]] according to R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;#61; V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where x is the distance from the reflectron entrance, V is the voltage and R is a constant.&lt;ref name=Cornish1993&gt;{{citation | last = Cornish | first =  Timothy J. | year = 1993 | title = A curved-field reflectron for improved energy focusing of product ions in time-of-flight mass spectrometry | journal = Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry | volume = 7 | pages = 1037 | doi = 10.1002/rcm.1290071114 | pmid = 8280914 | last2 = Cotter | first2 = RJ | issue = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cotter2005&gt;{{citation | last = Cotter | first =  R. | year = 2005 | title = The curved-field reflectron: PSD and CID without scanning, stepping or lifting | journal = International Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 240 | pages = 169 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijms.2004.09.022 | last2 = Iltchenko | first2 = S | last3 = Wang | first3 = D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Relaxation''' in the topic of [[NMR|Nuclear magnetic resonance]] phenomenology, describes the evolution of [[magnetization]]s separately in two directions:
* longitudinal relaxation: The part of the magnetization vector M that is parallel to the main magnetic field B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is usually called '''longitudinal magnetization''', designated as M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;. The process for it to recover to the thermal equilibrium magnetization M&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is called longitudinal relaxation, which involves a time constant T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;M_z(t) = M_0 - e^{-t/T_1}\cdot [M_0-M_z(t=0)] \,&lt;/math&gt;

* transverse relaxation: The part of the magnetization vector M that is [[perpendicular]] to the main magnetic field B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is usually called '''transverse magnetization''', which can be written as M&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, M&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;M_{\perp}&lt;/math&gt;. The process for it to decay to nearly zero is called transverse relaxation, which involves a time constant T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;M_{xy}(t) = e^{-t/T_2}\cdot M_{xy}(t=0) \,&lt;/math&gt;

==T1==
In an ideal environment where strict [[conservation of angular momentum]] is true for the nuclei being observed, T1 would not exist.  When you alter the magnetization of a nucleus, in the experimental pulse, it should maintain its precession.  So the bulk magnetization which is set into a disequilibrium cannot equilibrate.  However, in a real system, there is spin transfer between the observed nuclei and the environment.  This allows for conservation-&quot;forbidden&quot; transitions to occur, and &quot;relaxation&quot; from &quot;excited&quot; state back to equilibrium. 

T1 is by definition, the component of relaxation which occurs in the direction of the ambient magnetic field.   This generally comes about by interactions between the nucleus of interest and unexcited nuclei in the environment, as well as electric fields in the environment (collectively known as the 'lattice').  Therefore T1 is known as &quot;spin-lattice&quot; relaxation.

T1 is measured as the time required for the [[magnetization]] vector M to be restored to 63% of its original magnitude. It varies with the [[magnetic field density]] B.

==T2==
In an idealized system, T2 would also not exist. However, in real systems, there is spin transfer amongst excited nuclei which disperses magnetization that is out of equilibrium.

T2 by definition is the component of 'true' relaxation (see T2*) to equilibrium that occurs perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field.  Because of this, the relaxation is dominated by interactions between spinning nuclei which are already excited.  For this reason, T2 relaxation is called &quot;transverse&quot; or &quot;spin-spin&quot; relaxation.

Since T2 processes follow an exponential decay, the quantity T2 is defined as the time required for the transverse Magnetization vector to drop to 37% of its original magnitude after its initial excitation.

Unlike T1, T2 does not vary with the field strength B. It is strictly a property of the tissue. Unlike T2*, it is not susceptible to gradient fluctuations.

==T2*==
In an idealized system, all nuclei in a given chemical environment in a magnetic field spin with the same frequency.  However, in real systems, there are minor differences in chemical environment which can lead to a distribution of resonance frequencies around the ideal.  Over time, this distribution can lead to a dispersion of the tight distribution of magnetic spin vectors, and loss of signal ([[Free Induction Decay]]).  In fact, for most magnetic resonance experiments, this &quot;relaxation&quot; dominates.

However, this is not a true &quot;relaxation&quot; process.  For most molecules, the deviation from ideal relaxation is consistent over time, and the signal can be recovered by performing a [[spin-echo]] experiment.  

Unlike T2, T2* is influenced by magnetic field gradient irregularities. The T2* relaxation time is always less than the T2 relaxation time.

==Why T1 is slower than T2==
As a general rule, the following always holds true: T1 &gt; T2 &gt; T2*.

In order to get magnetization transfer, the energies and orientations of spins with magnetic entities in the lattice must be matched.  In most setups, this is a relatively rare condition, compared to spin-spin interactions, which ''a priori'' are aligned with each other.

== Local magnetic field inhomogeneity ==
Besides, due to the inhomogeneity in main field, there occurs intra-[[voxel]] [[dephasing]] resulting in a far faster decay of the signal from transverse magnetization than that predicted by T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decay, which can be written as:
: &lt;math&gt;M_{xy}(t) = e^{-t/T_2^*}\cdot M_{xy}(t=0) ; \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; T_2^*&lt;&lt;T_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding transverse relaxation time constant is thus T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, which is much smaller than T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The relation between them is:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{T_2^*}=\frac{1}{T_2}+\gamma \Delta B_0&lt;/math&gt;
where γ represents [[magnetogyric ratio]], and ΔB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the difference in strength of the locally varying field.

== Microscopic mechanism ==
In [[1948]], [[Nicolaas Bloembergen]], [[Edward Mills Purcell]], and R.V. Pound proposed the so-called [[Bloembergen-Purcell-Pound theory]] (BPP theory) to explain the relaxation constant of a pure substance in correspondence with its state, taking into account the effect of tumbling motion of [[molecule]]s on the local magnetic field disturbance {{Ref|Purcell}}. The theory was in good agreement with the experiments for pure substance, but not for complicated environment such as human body.

From this theory, one can get T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;、T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{T_1}=K[\frac{\tau_c}{1+\omega_0^2\tau_c^2}+\frac{4\tau_c}{1+4\omega_0^2\tau_c^2}]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{T_2}=\frac{K}{2}[3\tau_c+\frac{5\tau_c}{1+\omega_0^2\tau_c^2}+\frac{2\tau_c}{1+4\omega_0^2\tau_c^2}]&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Larmor frequency]] in correspondence with the strength of the main magnetic field &lt;math&gt;B_0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\tau_c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[correlation time]] of the molecular [[tumbling]] motion. &lt;math&gt;K=\frac{3\mu^2}{160\pi^2}\frac{\hbar^2\gamma^4}{r^6}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant with μ being the [[magnetic dipole moment]] of the [[spin-1/2]] nuclei, &lt;math&gt;\hbar=\frac{h}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt; the [[reduced Planck constant]], γ the [[gyromagnetic ratio]] of such species of nuclei, and r the distance between the two nuclei carrying magnetic dipole moment.

Taking for example the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules in [[liquid phase]] without the contamination of [[Isotopes of oxygen|oxygen 17]], the value of K is 1.02×10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; sec&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; and the correlation time &lt;math&gt;\tau_c&lt;/math&gt; is on the order of [[picosecond|ps]] = &lt;math&gt;10^{-12}&lt;/math&gt; [[second|sec]], while [[hydrogen|hydrogen nuclei]] &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H ([[proton]]s) at 1.5 [[tesla]] carry an Larmor frequency of approximately 64 [[MHz]]. We can then estimate using τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 5×10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; sec:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_0\tau_c = 3.2\times 10^{-5} &lt;/math&gt;(dimensionless)
:&lt;math&gt;T_1=(1.02\times 10^{10}[\frac{ 5\times 10^{-12} }{1 + (3.2\times 10^{-5} )^2} + \frac{ 4\cdot 5\times 10^{-12} }{1 + 4\cdot (3.2\times 10^{-5} )^2}])^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;= 3.92 sec
:&lt;math&gt;T_2=(\frac{1.02\times 10^{10}}{2}[3\cdot 5\times 10^{-12} + \frac{5\cdot 5\times 10^{-12} }{1 + (3.2\times 10^{-5} )^2} + \frac{ 2\cdot 5\times 10^{-12} }{1 + 4\cdot (3.2\times 10^{-5} )^2}])^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;= 3.92 sec,

which is close to the experimental value, 3.6 sec. Meanwhile, we can see that at this extreme case, T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; equals T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The '''residual dipolar coupling''' between two [[Spin (physics)|spin]]s in a molecule occurs if the molecules in solution exhibit a partial alignment leading to an incomplete averaging of spatially anisotropic [[dipolar coupling]]s.

Partial molecular alignment leads to an incomplete averaging of anisotropic magnetic interactions such as the [[magnetic dipole-dipole interaction]] (also called dipolar coupling), the [[chemical shift]] anisotropy, or the electric [[quadrupole]] interaction. The resulting so-called ''residual'' anisotropic magnetic interactions are becoming increasingly important in biomolecular [[NMR spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;Eike Brunner, ''Concepts in Magnetic Resonance'', Volume 13, Issue 4 , Pages 238 - 259 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Shilirren texture.jpg|thumb|300px|Liquid crystals are commonly used to permit the observation of residual dipolar couplings in high-resolution liquid-state NMR spectra.]]

== History and pioneering works ==
NMR spectroscopy in partially oriented media was first discovered in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;Saupe, A.; Englert, G. ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' 11, 462-464. (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; and in a very fundamental paper [[Alfred Saupe]] was also able to present the essential theory to describe and understand the observable phenomena only one year later.&lt;ref&gt;Saupe, A ''Z. Naturforsch.'' 19a, 161-171. (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; After this initiation a flood of NMR spectra in various liquid
crystalline phases was reported (see ''e.g.'' &lt;ref&gt;Snyder, L. C. ''J. Chem. Phys.'' 43, 4041-4050. (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sackmann, E. ''et al.'', ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' 89,
5981-5982 (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yannoni, C. S. ''et al.'', ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' 89,
2833-2836(1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luckhurst, G. R. ''Q. ReV.'' 22, 179-198(1968).&lt;/ref&gt;).

A second technique for partial alignment which is not limited by a minimum anisotropy is strain-induced alignment in a gel (SAG), based on the pioneering work of Deloche and Samulski.&lt;ref&gt;Deloche, B.; Samulski, E. T. ''Macromolecules'' 14, 575-581 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was extensively used to study the properties of polymer gels by means of high-resolution deuterium NMR,&lt;ref&gt;Samulski, E. T. ''Polymer'' 26, 177-189 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; but only lately gel alignment was used to induce RDCs in molecules dissolved into the gel.&lt;ref&gt;Sass, H. J. ''et al.'', ''J. Biomol. NMR'' 18, 303-309 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tycko, R. ''et al.'', ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' 122, 9340-9341 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; SAG allows the unrestricted scaling of alignment over a wide range and can be used for aqueous as well as organic solvents, depending on the polymer used. As a first example in organic solvents, RDC measurements in stretched polystyrene (PS) gels swollen in CDCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; were reported as a promising alignment method.&lt;ref&gt;Luy, B. ''et al.'', ''Angew. Chem., Int. Ed.'' 43, 1092-
1094 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, James H. Prestegard and coworkers demonstrated that NMR spectra of certain proteins (in this case cyanometmyoglobin, which has a very highly anisotropic [[paramagnetic]] susceptibility), taken at very high field, may contain data that can usefully complement [[Nuclear Overhauser effect|NOE]]s in determining a tertiary fold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prestegard, J.H. 1995&quot;&gt;Prestegard, J.H. ''et al.'', ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.'' 92, 9279−9283 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 and 1997, Tjandra ''et al.'' measured RDCs in a [[diamagnetic]] protein ([[ubiquitin]]). The results were in good agreement with crystal structure.&lt;ref&gt;Tjandra, N., Grzesiek, S. &amp; Bax, A., ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' 118, 6264−6272 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tjandra, N. &amp; Bax, A., ''J. Magn. Reson.'' 124, 512−515 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics of RDC==

[[Image:SSNMR dip coupl vect2.png|thumb|The dipolar coupling between two nuclei depends on the distance between them, and the angle of bond relative to the external magnetic field|200px|right|The dipolar coupling between two nuclei depends on the distance between them, and the angle of bond relative to the external magnetic field]]

The general form for the dipolar coupling [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|hamiltonian]] of two [[Spin (physics)|spin]]s, I and S is as follows:

[[Image:Dipolar-coupling-hamiltonian.JPG]]

where:
*h is the [[Planck's constant]].
*γ is the [[gyromagnetic ratio]].
*r is the inter-spin distance.
*θ is the angle between the inter-spin vector and the external [[magnetic field]].
*I and S are spin operators.

The above equation can be rewritten in the following form:

[[Image:Dipolar-coupling-hamiltonian-2.JPG]]

The first term on the left is similar to the hamiltonian for [[J-coupling]], which is responsible for splitting of lines in NMR spectrum. In other words coupling constant will differ when the molecules in the sample are aligned (J + 2D) or not (J). The difference is what is named as ''residual'' dipolar coupling:

[[Image:Dipolar-coupling-constant.JPG]]

Note that residual dipolar coupling can be positive or negative, depending on the range of angles that are sampled.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, C.R., Hare, B.J., Howard, K.P. &amp; Prestegard, J.H., ''Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc.'' 26, 421−444 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to static distance and angular information, RDC may contain information about internal motions in molecules. To each atom in a molecule one can associate a motion tensor '''B''', that may be computed from RDCs according to the following relation&lt;ref&gt;[Tolman, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 124:12020–12030, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;:

[[Image:RDC-dynamics-equ.JPG]]

where A is the molecular alignment [[tensor]].
The rows of B contain the motion tensors for each atom. The motion tensors also have five [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. From each motion tensor, 5 parameters of interest can be computed. The variables S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, η&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, β&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and γ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are used to denote these 5 parameters for atom i. S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the magnitude of atom i’s motion; η&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is a measure of the anisotropy of atom i’s motion; α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and β&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are related to the polar coordinates of the bond vector expressed in the initial arbitrary reference frame (i.e., the PDB frame). If the motion of the atom is anisotropic (i.e., η&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 0), the final parameter,  γ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; measures the principal orientation of the motion.

Note that the RDC-derived motion parameters are local measurements.

==Measurement of RDC==
[[Image:800px-RDc-effects-HSQC-vertical.png|thumb|200px|right|Panel C depicts the effect of N-H residual dipolar coupling on undecoupled HSQC spectrum. A: no splitting, B: J-splitting, C: JD-splitting]]
Any RDC measurement in solution consists of two steps, aligning the molecules and NMR studies:

===Methods for aligning molecules===
For [[diamagnetic]] molecules at moderate field strengths, molecules have little preference in orientation, the tumbling samples a nearly isotropic distribution, and average [[dipolar coupling]]s goes to zero. Actually, most molecules have preferred orientations in the presence of a magnetic field, because most have anisotropic [[magnetic susceptibility]] [[tensor]]s, Χ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prestegard, J.H. 1995&quot;/&gt;

The method is most suitable for systems with large values for magnetic susceptibility tensor. This includes: Protein-nucleic acid complex, [[nucleic acids]], proteins with large number of [[aromatic]] residues, [[porphyrin]] containing proteins and metal binding proteins (metal may be replaced by [[lanthanide]]s).

For a fully oriented molecule, the dipolar coupling for an &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N [[amide group]] would be over 20 [[Hertz|kHz]], and a pair of protons separated by 5 Å would have up to ~1&amp;nbsp;kHz coupling. However the degree of alignment achieved by applying magnetic field is so low that the largest &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N or &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C dipolar couplings are &lt;5&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name=&quot;M.R. Hansen 1998&quot;&gt;M.R. Hansen ''et al.'' ''Nature Structural Biology'', 5(12) p.1065 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore many different alignment media have been designed:

*Lipid bicelles (with large magnetic susceptibility): measured RDCs were of the order of hundreds of Hz.&lt;ref&gt;Metz G. ''et al.'' ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' 117, 564-565 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Liquid crystal]]line bicelles: measured RDCs were between -40 and +20&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;Nico Tjandra and Ad Bax. ''Science'' Vol. 278. no. 5340, pp. 1111 - 1114 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
*filamentous Pf1 bacteriophage (large anisotropic magnetic susceptibility): &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H through space dipolar coupling were measured.&lt;ref name=&quot;M.R. Hansen 1998&quot;/&gt;

===NMR experiments===
There are numerous methods that have been designed to accurately measure coupling constant between nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;Prestegard, J.H., Al-Hashimi, H.M. &amp; Tolman, J.R., ''Q. Rev. Biophys.'', 33:371-424 2000&lt;/ref&gt; They have been classified into two groups: ''frequency based methods'' where separation of peaks centers (splitting) is measured in a frequency domain, and ''intensity based methods'' where the coupling is extracted from the resonance intensity instead of splitting. The two methods complement each other as each of them is subject to a different kind of systematic errors. Here are the prototypical examples of NMR experiments belonging to each of the two groups:

* ''Intensity methods'': quantitative J-modulation experiment and phase modulated methods
* ''frequency resolved methods'': SCE-[[HSQC]], [[E. COSY]] and spin state selective experiments

==RDC and structural biology ==
RDC measurement provides information on the global [[Protein structure|folding]] of the protein or protein complex. As opposed to traditional NOE based [[Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR structure determinations]], RDCs provide long distance structural information. It also provides information about the dynamics  in molecules on time scales slower than nanoseconds.

===RDC and studies of biomolecular structure ===
[[Image:RDC and protein structure.png|thumb|300px|The blue arrows represent the orientation of the N - H bond of selected peptide bonds. By determining the orientation of a sufficient amount of bonds relative to the external magnetic field, the structure of the protein can be determined. From PDB 1KBH.]]
Most NMR studies of protein structure are based on analysis of the [[Nuclear Overhauser effect]], NOE, between different protons in the protein. Because the NOE depends on the inverted sixth power of the distance between the nuclei, r&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;, NOEs can be converted into distance restraints, that can be used in [[molecular dynamics]]-type structure calculations. RDCs provide orientational restraints rather than distance restraints, and has several advantages over NOEs:

*RDCs give information about the angle relative to the external magnetic field, which means that it can give information about the relative orientation of parts of the molecule, that are far apart in the structure.
*In large molecules (&gt;25kDa) it is often difficult to record NOEs due to spin diffusion. This is not a problem with RDCs.
*Analysis of a high number of NOEs can be very time consuming.

Provided that a very complete set of RDCs is available, it has been demonstrated for several model systems that molecular structures can be calculated exclusively based on these anisotropic interactions, without recourse to NOE restraints. However, in practice, this is not achievable and RDC is used mainly to refine a structure determined by NOE data and J-couplings. One problem with using dipolar couplings in structure determination is that a dipolar coupling does not uniquely describe an internuclear vector orientation. Moreover if a very small set of dipolar couplings are available, the refinement may lead to a structure worse than the original one. For a protein with N aminoacids, 2N RDC constraint for backbone is the minimum needed for an accurate refinement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander Grishaev 2005&quot;&gt;Ad Bax and Alexander Grishaev, ''Current Opinion in Structural Biology'', 15:563–570 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of elongated molecules such as [[RNA]], where local torsional information and short distances are not enough to constrain the structures, RDC measurements can provide information about the orientations of specific [[chemical bond]]s throughout a nucleic acid with respect to a single coordinate frame. Particularly, RNA molecules are [[proton]]-poor and overlap of [[ribose]] resonances make it very difficult to use [[J-coupling]] and [[Nuclear Overhauser effect|NOE]] data to determine the structure. Moreover, RDCs between nuclei with a distance larger than 5-6 Å can be detected. This distance is too much for generation of NOE signal. This is because RDC is proportional to r&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; whereas NOE is proportional to r&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;.

RDC measurements have recently been proved useful for a rapid determination of the relative orientations of units of known structures in proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Tang C. ''et al.'' ''J Biol Chem'', 280:11770-11780. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In principle, the orientation of a structural subunit, which may be as small as a turn of a helix or as large as an entire domain, can be established from as few as five RDCs per subunit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander Grishaev 2005&quot;/&gt;

===RDC and protein dynamics ===
Although [[crystallography]] B-factors, [[Relaxation (NMR)|NMR spin relaxation]] analysis can be used to measure motional parameters, they suffer from several drawbacks. For example they assume dynamic independence of different regions of the molecule under investigation. Techniques like [[quasielastic scattering|quasielastic]] and [[inelastic scattering|inelastic]] [[neutron scattering]], diffuse [[X-ray scattering]], inelastic [[Rudolf Mößbauer|Mossbauer]] scattering and [[dielectric spectroscopy]]&lt;ref&gt;Gitsas A, Floudas G, Dietz M, Mondeshki M, Spiess H. W., Wegner G ''Macromolecules'' 40:8311-8322 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; can in principle provide information about correlated motions. However interpretation of data on molecular level is often difficult. While [[molecular dynamics|molecular dynamic simulation]] are very successful in predicting pico to nano second motions, they are often limited in their abilities in investigating &quot;long&quot;-time scale motions. In the recent years success has been reported by several investigators in predicting slow conformational changes in proteins at the microsecond-millisecond time-scales (or the long time-scale motions) that are related to catalysis in enzymes such as [[dihydrofolate reductase]] and [[cyclophilin]] A using theoretical techniques. These slow conformational changes have been verified by NMR techniques.

For the first time in 1997, Prestegard ''et al.'' investigated slow dynamics (&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; s) in [[myoglobin]] by RDC measurement.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Tolman ''et al.'' ''Nature Structural Biology''  4, 292 - 297 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; In general, internal motion of a bond vector relative to the molecular alignment frame scales the size of the RDC relative to a static average orientation. This scaling factor is dependent on both the amplitude and the direction of such motion relative to the alignment tensor; scaling factors therefore will differ with the alignment medium used. RDC approach to studying dynamics is most robust for large-amplitude processes (&gt; 20°).&lt;ref&gt;Bouvignies G, Bernado P, Blackledge M.'' J. Magn. Reson.''  173:328-338 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mass spectrometry]], '''resolution''' measures of the ability to distinguish two [[Summit (topography)|peak]]s of slightly different [[mass-to-charge ratio]]s ''ΔM'', in a [[mass spectrum]]. 

== Resolution and Resolving Power ==

There are two different definitions of resolution and resolving power in mass spectrometry. 

=== IUPAC definition ===
The [[IUPAC]] definition for resolution in mass spectrometry is
:&lt;math&gt;R = \cfrac{M}{\Delta M}&lt;/math&gt; = resolution
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta M&lt;/math&gt; = resolving power

where a larger resolution indicates a better separation of peaks.&lt;ref name='R05318' &gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=resolution in mass spectroscopy|file=R05318}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is used in a number of mass spectrometry texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mass Spectrometry: Organic Chemical Applications |last=Biemann |first= Klaus |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1962 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=0070052352 |page=13 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-935702-25-3&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Tureček, František; McLafferty, Fred W. |title=Interpretation of mass spectra |publisher=University Science Books |location=Sausalito, Calif |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-935702-25-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-397-51688-6&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Watson, J.

A high value for resolution corresponding to good separation of peaks is similar to the convention used with [[chromatography]] separations,&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=resolution in gas chromatography]]|file=R05317}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is important to note that the definitions are not the same.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11758739&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blumberg LM, Kle MS |title=Metrics of separation in chromatography |journal=J Chromatogr A |volume=933 |issue=1-2 |pages=1–11 |year=2001 |month=November |pmid=11758739 |doi= 10.1016/S0021-9673(01)01256-0|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; High resolution indicating better peak separation is also used in [[ion mobility spectrometry]]&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-8493-2247-2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Karpas, Zeev; Eiceman, Gary Alan |title=Ion mobility spectrometry |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-8493-2247-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IUPAC defines Δm as the resolving power.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=resolving power in mass spectrometry|file=R05321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resolving power definition===

Some mass spectrometrists use the definition that is similar to definitions used in some other fields of physics and chemistry. In this case, resolving power is defined as: 
:&lt;math&gt;R = \cfrac{M}{\Delta M}&lt;/math&gt; = resolving power.

The minimum peak separation ΔM which allows to distinguish two ion species is then called:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta M&lt;/math&gt; = resolution.

Resolution and resolving power, when defined in this way, are consistent with IUPAC recommendations for [[microscopy]], [[optical spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=resolution in optical spectroscopy|file=R05319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=resolving power in optical spectroscopy|file=R05322}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ion microscopy (SIMS) &lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=resolving power in ion microscopy|file=I03221}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not gas chromatography.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=resolution in gas chromatography|file=R05317}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This definition also appears in some mass spectrometry texts.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-9660813-9-0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=David O. Sparkman |title=Mass Spectrometry Desk Reference |publisher=Global View Pub |location=Pittsburgh |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-9660813-9-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-470-51634-8&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Sparkman, O.

==Measuring peak separation==
There are several ways to define the minimum peak separation ''ΔM'' in mass spectrometry, therefore it is important to report the method used to determine mass resolution when reporting its value.
The two most widely used are the peak width definition and the valley definition.&lt;ref name='R05318' /&gt;  

===Peak width definition===
In the peak width definition, the value of Δm is the width of the peak measured at a specified fraction of the peak height, for example 0.5%, 5%, 10% or 50%. The latter is called the [[full width at half maximum]] (FWHM).

===Valley definition===
The valley definition defines ΔM as the closest spacing of two peaks of equal intensity with the valley (lowest value of signal) between them less than a specified fraction of the peak height. Typical values are 10% or 50%. The value obtained from a 5% peak width is roughly equivalent to a 10% valley.&lt;ref name='R05318' /&gt;

'''Resonance Enhanced Multi-Photon Ionization''' ('''REMPI''') is a technique applied to the [[spectroscopy]] of [[atom]]s and small [[molecule]]s. In practice, a tunable [[laser]] can be used to access an [[Excited state|excited intermediate state]]. The [[selection rule]]s associated with a two-[[photon]] or other multi-photon [[Absorption spectroscopy|photoabsorption]] are different from the selection rules for a single photon transition. The REMPI technique typically involves a resonant single or multiple photon absorption to an electronically excited intermediate state followed by another photon which [[Ionization|ionizes]] the atom or molecule. The light intensity to achieve a typical multiphoton transition is generally significantly larger than the light intensity to achieve a single photon photoabsorption. Because of this, a subsequent photoabsorption is often very likely. An ion and a free electron will result if the photons have imparted enough energy to exceed the ionization threshold energy of the system. In many cases, REMPI provides spectroscopic information that can be unavailable to [[Absorption spectroscopy|single photon spectroscopic methods]], for example [[Rotational spectroscopy|rotational structure]] in molecules is easily seen with this technique.

==[[Rydberg states]],   [[Rydberg molecules]]==

High photon intensity experiments can involve multiphoton processes with the absorption of integer multiples of the photon energy. In experiments that involve a multiphoton resonance, the intermediate is often a low-lying [[Rydberg states|Rydberg state]], and the final state is often an ion. The initial state of the system, photon energy, angular momentum and other selection rules can help in determining the nature of the intermediate state. This approach is exploited in Resonance Enhanced Multi-Photon Ionization Spectroscopy (REMPI). The technique is in wide use in both [[Atomic spectroscopy|atomic]] and molecular spectroscopy. An advantage of the REMPI technique is that the ions can be detected with almost complete efficiency and even [[Time-of-flight|time resolved for their mass]]. It is also possible to gain additional information by performing experiments to look at the energy of the liberated photoelectron in these experiments. (Robert N. Compton&lt;ref&gt;http://web.utk.edu/~rcompton/&lt;/ref&gt; formerly of [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|O.R.N.L.]] and Philip M. Johnson&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chem.stonybrook.edu/PJohnson.html&lt;/ref&gt; pioneered the development of REMPI. The technique was named by Johnson).{{Fact|date=January 2009}}

In &quot;Applied Laser Spectroscopy, ed. D. Andrews, VCH (1992), Chapter 9 &quot;Laser Mass Spectroscopy&quot; by K.W. Ledingham and R.P. Singhal&quot; it is stated, that R.N. Zare is the namegiving instance to the REMPI process.&lt;ref&gt;Applied Laser Spectroscopy, ed. D. Andrews, VCH (1992), Chapter 9 &quot;Laser Mass Spectroscopy&quot; by K.W. Ledingham and R.P.

In resonance fluorescence, a photon is absorbed, causing an electron to jump to a higher level from which, after a delay, it falls back to its original level,  emitting a photon having the same energy as the one absorbed. The emission direction is random.

'''Resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy''' is a specialized implementation of the more general [[Raman spectroscopy]].
== Overview ==
As in Raman spectroscopy, RR spectroscopy provides information about the vibrations of [[molecule]]s, and can also be used for identifying unknown substances. RR spectroscopy has found wide application to the analysis of ''[[inorganic|bioinorganic]]'' molecules.  Although the technique uses a different part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] than [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared (IR) spectroscopy]], the two methods are actually complementary. Both are used to measure the [[energy]] required to change the vibrational state of a [[chemical compound]].

IR spectroscopy involves measuring the direct absorption of [[photon]]s with the appropriate energy to excite [[Covalent bond|molecular bond]] vibrations. The [[wavelength]]s of these photons lie in the [[infrared]] region of the [[spectrum]], hence the name of the technique.  Raman spectroscopy measures the excitation of bond vibrations in an indirect manner. The two methods are complementary because some vibrational transitions that are observed in IR spectroscopy are not observed in Raman spectroscopy, and vice versa.  RR [[spectroscopy]] is an improvement of traditional Raman spectroscopy that has increased sensitivity and is better suited for the study of complicated systems.

'''X-Ray Raman Scattering'''

In the [[x-ray]] region, enough energy is available for making [[Molecular electronic transition|electronic transition]]s possible. At core level resonances, X-Ray Raman Scattering can become the dominating part of the [[x-ray fluorescence]] spectrum. This is due to the resonant behavior of the [[Kramers-Heisenberg formula]] in which the denominator is minimized for incident energies that equal a core level. This type of scattering is also known as resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). In the soft x-ray range, RIXS has been shown to reflect [[crystal field excitations]], which are often hard to observe with any other technique. Application of RIXS to [[strongly correlated material]]s is of particular value for gaining knowledge about their [[electronic structure]]. For certain [[wide band materials]] such as [[graphite]], RIXS has been shown to (nearly) conserve [[crystal momentum]] and thus has found use as a complementary [[bandmapping]] technique.

== History ==

Raman spectroscopy utilizes the phenomenon of [[scattering]].  When light passes through a transparent sample, a fraction of the light is scattered in all directions.  Most of the scattered photons are of the same wavelength of the incident light.  This is known as [[Rayleigh scattering]].  However, in 1928, physicists [[C.V. Raman]] and [[K.S. Krishnan]], and independently [[Grigory Landsberg]] and [[Leonid Isaakovich Mandelshtam|Leonid Mandelstam]] discovered that a small fraction of the scattered light had a different wavelength.  Furthermore, this difference depended on the molecules present in the sample.  For these observations, and his explanation of the phenomenon, Raman was awarded the 1930 [[Nobel Prize]] in physics.  His explanation is now known as the theory of [[Raman scattering]].  

In the years following its discovery, Raman spectroscopy was used to provide the first catalog of molecular vibrational frequencies. Originally, heroic measures were required to obtain Raman spectra due to the low sensitivity of the technique. Typically, the sample was held in a long tube and illuminated along its length with a beam of filtered [[monochromatic]] light generated by a [[gas discharge lamp]]. The photons that were scattered by the sample were collected through an [[optical flat]] at the end of the tube. To maximize the sensitivity, the sample was highly concentrated (1 M or more) and relatively large volumes (5 mL or more) were used. Consequently, the use of Raman spectroscopy dwindled when commercial IR [[Spectrophotometry|spectrophotometers]] became available in the 1940s. However, the advent of the [[laser]] in the 1960s resulted in simplified Raman spectroscopy instruments and also boosted the sensitivity of the technique. This has revived the use of Raman spectroscopy as a common analytical technique.

== Theory of Raman Scattering ==
===Degrees of Freedom===

For any given chemical compound, there are a total of 3N [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], where N is the number of [[atom]]s in the compound. This number arises from the ability of each atom in a molecule to move in three different directions (x, y, and z). When dealing with molecules, it is more common to consider the movement of the molecule as a whole. Consequently, the 3N degrees of freedom are partitioned into molecular translational, [[rotational motion|rotational]], and vibrational motion. Three of the degrees of freedom correspond to translational motion of the molecule as a whole (along each of the three spatial dimensions). Similarly, three degrees of freedom correspond to rotations of the molecule about the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axes. However, [[Chromonic|linear molecule]]s only have two rotations because rotations along the bond axis do not change the positions of the atoms in the molecule. The remaining degrees of freedom correspond to molecular vibrational modes. These modes include stretching and bending motions of the [[chemical bond]]s of the molecule. For a linear molecule, the number of vibrational modes is:

&lt;math&gt;3N-3-2 = 3N-5&lt;/math&gt;

whereas for a non-linear molecule the number of vibrational modes are 

&lt;math&gt;3N-6&lt;/math&gt;

===Molecular Vibrations and Infrared Radiation===

The frequencies of molecular vibrations are in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Hz.  These frequencies correspond to radiation in the infrared (IR) region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].  At any given instant, each molecule in a sample has a certain amount of vibrational energy.  However, the amount of vibrational energy that a molecule has continually changes due to collisions and other interactions with other molecules in the sample. 

At room temperature, most of molecules will be in the lowest [[energy level|energy state]], which is known as the [[ground state]].  A few molecules will be in higher energy states, which are known as excited states.   The fraction of molecules occupying a given vibrational mode at a given temperature can be calculated using the [[Boltzmann distribution]].  Performing such a calculation shows that, for relatively low temperatures (such as those used for most routine spectroscopy), most of the molecules occupy the ground vibrational state.  Such a molecule can be excited to a higher vibrational mode through the direct absorption of a photon of the appropriate energy.  This is the mechanism by which IR spectroscopy operates:  infrared radiation is passed through the sample, and the intensity of the transmitted light is compared with that of the incident light.  A reduction in intensity at a given wavelength of light indicates the absorption of energy by a vibrational transition.  The energy, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, of a [[photon]] is

&lt;math&gt;E=h \nu&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant|Planck’s constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[frequency]] of the [[radiation]].  Thus, the energy required for such transition may be calculated if the frequency of the incident radiation is known.

===Raman Scattering===

It is also possible to observe molecular vibrations by an inelastic scattering process. In inelastic scattering, an absorbed photon is re-emitted with lower energy.  In [[Raman scattering]], the difference in energy between the absorbed and re-emitted photons corresponds to the energy required to excite a molecule to a higher vibrational mode.  

Typically, in Raman spectroscopy high intensity laser radiation with wavelengths in either the [[visible]] or [[near-infrared]] regions of the spectrum is passed through a sample.  Photons from the laser beam are absorbed by the molecules, exciting them to a virtual energy state.  If the molecules relax back to the vibrational state that they started in, the reemitted photon has the same energy as the original photon.  This leads to scattering of the laser light, but with no change in energy between the incoming photons and the reemitted/scattered photons.  This type of scattering is known as [[Rayleigh scattering]].  

However, it is possible for the molecules to relax back to a vibrational state that is higher in energy than the state they started in.  In this case, the original photon and the reemitted photon differ in energy by the amount required to vibrationally excite the molecule.  Generally, the difference in energy is recorded as the difference in [[wavenumber]] (&lt;math&gt;\Delta \bar \nu&lt;/math&gt;) between the laser light and the scattered light.  A Raman spectrum is generated by plotting the intensity of the reemitted light versus &lt;math&gt;\Delta \bar \nu&lt;/math&gt;.  In this example the reemitted radiation is lower in energy than the incident laser light.  Consequently, the change in wavenumber is positive and results in a series of peaks in the Raman spectrum known as Stokes lines.

A Raman spectrum also exhibits peaks that correspond to negative values of &lt;math&gt;\Delta \bar \nu&lt;/math&gt;.  These peaks are due to re-emitted photons that are higher in energy than the incident photons.  This occurs when molecules that initially are in an excited vibrational state absorb the laser light and relax back to the lower vibrational state when they reemit the photon.  These lines in the Raman spectrum are known as anti-Stokes lines.  Since the Stokes lines and anti-Stokes lines gain and lose the same amount of energy, they are symmetric with respect to the peak due to elastic (Rayleigh) scattering (&lt;math&gt;\Delta \bar \nu=0&lt;/math&gt;).  The anti-Stokes lines are appreciably less intense than the corresponding Stokes lines.  This is because initially very few molecules are in excited vibrational states compared to the number in the ground state.  Since anti-Stokes lines arise from the former and Stokes lines arise from the latter, the Stokes lines are much more intense.  However, it should be noted that in molecules which exhibit [[fluorescence]], the Stokes lines may be obscured while the anti-Stokes lines remain unaffected.  In such cases, it is necessary to use the anti-Stokes lines despite their lower intensity.

== Resonance Raman Spectroscopy ==

Raman spectroscopy can be used to identify chemical compounds because the values of &lt;math&gt;\Delta \bar \nu&lt;/math&gt; are indicative of different chemical species.  This is because the frequencies of [[vibrational transition]]s depend on the atomic masses and the bond strengths. (Heavier atoms correspond to lower vibrational frequencies, while stronger bonds correspond to higher vibrational frequencies.)  Thus, armed with a database of spectra from known compounds, one can unambiguously identify many different known chemical compounds based on a Raman spectrum.  The number of vibrational modes scales with the number of atoms in a molecule, which means that the Raman spectra from large molecules will be very complicated.  For example, [[protein]]s, typically contain thousands of atoms, and will therefore have thousands of vibrational modes.  If these modes have similar energies (&lt;math&gt;\Delta \bar \nu&lt;/math&gt;), then the spectrum may be incredibly cluttered and complicated.

Not all vibrational transitions will be “Raman active”, i.e. some vibrational transitions will not appear in the Raman spectrum.  This is because of the spectroscopic selection rules for Raman.  As opposed to IR spectroscopy, where a transition can only be seen when that particular vibration causes a net change in [[bond dipole moment|dipole moment]] of the molecule, in Raman only transitions where the [[polarizability]] of the molecule changes can be observed.  This is due to the fundamental difference in how IR and Raman spectroscopy access the vibrational transitions.  In Raman spectroscopy, the incoming photon causes a momentary distortion of the electron distribution around a bond in a molecule, followed by reemission of the radiation as the bond returns to its normal state.  This causes temporary [[polarization]] of the bond, and an induced dipole that disappears upon relaxation.  In a molecule with a center of symmetry, a change in dipole is accomplished by loss of the center of symmetry, while a change in polarizability is compatible with preservation of the center of symmetry.  Thus, in a centrosymmetric molecule, asymmetrical stretching and bending will be IR active and Raman inactive, while symmetrical stretching and bending will be Raman active and IR inactive.  Hence, in a centrosymmetric molecule, IR and Raman spectroscopy are mutually exclusive.  For molecules without a center of symmetry, each vibrational mode may be IR active, Raman active, both, or neither.  Symmetrical stretches and bends, however, tend to be Raman active.

In resonance Raman spectroscopy, the energy of the incoming laser is adjusted such that it or the scattered light coincide  with an electronic transition of the molecule or crystal.  In most materials the incoming and outgoing electronic resonances are sufficiently broad that they can not be distinguished.  So, rather than exciting the molecule to a virtual energy state, it is excited to near one of its excited electronic transitions.  Since the energy of these transitions differ from one chemical species to the next, this technique did not become applicable until the advent of tunable lasers in the early 1970s. (Tunable lasers are those where the wavelength can be altered within a specific range.)  When the frequency of the laser beam is tuned to be near an electronic transition (resonance), the vibrational modes associated with that particular transition exhibit a greatly increased Raman scattering intensity.  This usually overwhelms Raman signals from all of the other transitions.  For instance, resonance with a π-π* transition enhances stretching modes of the π-bonds involved with the transition, while the other modes remain unaffected. 

This aspect of Raman spectroscopy becomes especially useful for large biomolecules with [[chromophores]] embedded in their structure.  In such chromophores, the charge-transfer (CT) transitions of the metal complex generally enhance metal-[[ligand]] stretching modes, as well as some of modes associated with the ligands alone.  Hence, in a biomolecule such as hemoglobin, tuning the laser to near the charge-transfer electronic transition of the iron center results in a spectrum reflecting only the stretching and bending modes associated with the tetrapyrrole-iron group.  Consequently, in a molecule with thousands of vibrational modes, RR spectroscopy allows us to look at relatively few vibrational modes at a time.  This reduces the complexity of the spectrum and allows for easier identification of an unknown protein.  Also, if a protein has more than one chromophore, different chromophores can be studied individually if their CT bands differ in energy.  In addition to identifying compounds, RR spectroscopy can also supply structural identification about chromophores in some cases.

The main advantage of RR spectroscopy over traditional Raman spectroscopy is the large increase in intensity of the peaks in question (by as much as a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;).  This allows RR spectra to be generated with sample concentrations as low as 10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt; M.  This is in stark contrast to conventional Raman spectra, which usually requires concentrations greater than 0.01 M.  Also, as previously mentioned, RR spectra usually exhibit only a few peaks, and different peaks can be selected for by targeting specific electronic transitions.  The main disadvantage of RR spectroscopy is the increased risk of fluorescence and photodegradation of the sample due to the increased energy of the incoming laser light.  Both of these factors can be minimized by using an infrared laser instead of visible light for non resonant Raman scattering, but not in RR where the laser must be tuned to the specific resonance, unless electronic levels of lower energy are available for the system under investigation.

== Instrumentation ==

In RR spectroscopy, the [[light source]] consists of a tunable laser, whose radiation lies in either the near-infrared, visible, or near-ultraviolet regions of the spectrum.  In creating a sample handling system, RR spectroscopy offers an advantage over IR spectroscopy in that glass can be used for windows, [[lens (optics)|lenses]], and other [[optical]] components.  Another advantage over IR spectroscopy is that whereas [[water]] absorbs strongly in the IR spectrum and may mask other signals, it only gives a weak signal in Raman spectroscopy.  Therefore, water can easily be used as a solvent.  Since lasers can be easily focused on small surface areas, the risk of sample heating and photodegradation is diminished, and the emitted radiation can be focused more efficiently.  Typically, the sample is placed into a tube, which can then be spun to further decrease the sample’s exposure to the laser light, further diminishing the threat of photodegradation.  [[Gaseous]], [[liquid]], and [[solid]] samples can all be analyzed using RR spectroscopy.  Gas and liquid samples can be put directly into the sample chamber whereas solid samples must first be ground into a powder.  With gaseous and solid samples, Raman scattering may still be too weak to easily detect.  For these samples, the sample holder is placed between two mirrors that reflect the laser beam multiple times through the sample.  

Since scattered light leaves the sample in all directions the probes that carry the scattered light back to the detector in Raman spectroscopy may be placed at any [[angle]].  Usually, the detector probes are most placed at an angle of 135° to the path of the exiting laser light beam.  Two other common arrangements position the detector probe at 90° or 180° with respect to the incident light.  Detection angles greater than 90° are generally called back-scattering detectors because they are oriented in the same direction as the incident laser light so the radiation must scatter back to the probes.  In transmitting the incident laser light to the sample and the scattered light ''back'' to the detector, [[fiber-optic cable]]s may be used.  Such cables can transmit light 100 m or more, thereby allowing the analysis of samples under relatively rough experimental/environmental conditions.  

After the scattered radiation exits the sample, it is sent through a [[monochromator]]. Typical monochromators consist of a [[diffraction grating]] mounted on a rotating platform.  A diffraction grating causes light [[dispersion]].  Rotating the grating controls which wavelengths of scattered radiation reach the exit slit leading to the detector.  The detector itself is usually a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD), which allows the entire spectrum to be recorded simultaneously.  Consequently, multiple scans can be acquired in a short period of time, which can drastically increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum.  Currently, Raman [[spectrometer]]s are more expensive than more traditional dispersive instruments.  As the cost of tunable lasers decrease, RR spectroscopy should see increased use, especially in the studies of metal-ligand vibrations, which reside in a region that is typically very difficult to study by other instrumental techniques.  With the advent of near-infrared tunable lasers, particularly the Ti-sapphire dye laser (which has a range of ~700-1100 nm), Fourier Transform Resonance Raman Spectrometers may soon be commercially available.  These would offer the multiplex and Jaquinot advantages of [[Fourier Transform]] (FT) techniques.

Despite its long history, high-sensitivity high-accuracy mass measurements of atomic nuclei continue to be very important areas of research for many branches of physics. Not only do these measurements provide us with a better understanding of nuclear structures and nuclear forces but they also offer insight into how matter behaves in some of Nature’s harshest environments. At facilities such as [[ISOLDE|ISOLDE]] at [[CERN|CERN]] and [[TRIUMF|TRIUMF]] in Vancouver, for instance, measurement techniques are now being extended to short-lived radionuclei that only occur naturally in the interior of exploding stars. Their short half-lives and very low production rates at even the most powerful facilities require the very highest in sensitivity of such measurements.

[[penning trap|Penning traps]], the central element in modern high-accuracy high-sensitivity mass measurement installations, enable measurements of accuracies approaching 1 part in 10^11 on single ions. However, to achieve this Penning traps must have the ion to be measured delivered to it very precisely and with certainty that it is indeed the desired ion. This imposes severe requirements on the apparatus that must take the atomic nucleus out of the target in which it has been created, sort it from the myriad of other ions that are emitted from the target and then direct it so that it can be captured in the measurement trap.

Cooling these ion beams, particularly radioactive ion beams, has been shown to drastically improve the accuracy and sensitivity of mass measurements by reducing the [[phase space|phase space]] of the ion collections in question. Using a light neutral background gas, typically helium, charged particles originating from on-line mass separators undergo a number of soft collisions with the background gas molecules resulting in fractional losses of the ions’ kinetic energy and a reduction of the ion ensemble’s overall energy. In order for this to be effective however, the ions need to be contained using transverse radiofrequency quadrupole (RFQ) electric fields during the collisional cooling process (also known as buffer gas cooling).  These RFQ coolers operate on the same principles as [[quadrupole ion trap|quadrupole ion traps]] and have been shown to be particularly well suited for buffer gas cooling given their capacity for total confinement of ions having a large dispersion of velocities, corresponding to kinetic energies up to tens of electron volts. A number of the RFQ coolers have already been installed at research facilities around the world and a list of their characteristics can be found below.

'''Rotational spectroscopy''' or '''microwave spectroscopy''' studies the [[Absorption_%28optics%29|absorption]] and [[emission]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (typically in the [[microwave]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]) by [[molecules]] causing change in the [[Rotational_quantum_number|rotational]] [[quantum number]] of the molecule. The use of microwaves in spectroscopy essentially became possible due to the development of microwave technology for [[RADAR]] during [[World War II]]. Rotational spectroscopy is only really practical in the [[gas]] [[Phase_%28matter%29|phase]] where the [[rotational]] [[motion]] is [[Quantization_%28physics%29|quantized]]. In [[solids]] or [[liquids]] the rotational motion is usually quenched due to collisions.

Rotational spectrum from a molecule (to first order) requires that the molecule  have a [[dipole moment]], that is a difference between the center of [[charge]] and the [[center of mass]], or equivalently a separation between two unlike charges. It is this dipole moment that enables the [[electric field]] of the [[light]] ([[microwave]]) to exert a [[torque]] on the molecule causing it to rotate more quickly (in [[excitation]]) or slowly (in de-excitation). [[Diatomic|Diatomic molecules]] such as [[Oxygen|Oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]], [[Hydrogen|Hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]], etc. do not have a dipole moment and hence no pure-rotational spectrum. However, electronic excitation can lead to asymmetric charge distribution and thus providing a net dipole moment to the molecule. Under such circumstances, these molecules will exhibit a rotational spectrum.

The simplest rotational spectra belongs to [[diatomic|diatomic molecules]] [[Carbon_monoxide|Carbon monoxide (CO)]].
The next simplest spectra belongs to linear triatomic molecule, such as [[Hydrogen_cyanide|Hydrogen cyanide (HC&amp;equiv;N)]].
The next simplest spectra belongs to non-linear triatomic molecules, such as [[Hydrogen_isocyanide|Hydrogen isocyanide (HN=C:)]].

What information can be extracted from microwave spectroscopy?

In [[quantum mechanics]] the free rotation of a molecule is quantized, that is the [[rotational energy]] and the [[angular momentum]] can only take certain fixed values; what these values are is simply related to the [[moment of inertia]], I, of the molecule. In general for any molecule, there are three moments of inertia (&lt;math&gt;I_A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I_B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_C&lt;/math&gt; about three mutually orthogonal axes &lt;math&gt;A,B,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;). A linear molecule is a special case in this regard. These molecules are cylindrically symmetric and one of the moment of inertia (&lt;math&gt;I_A&lt;/math&gt;, which is the moment of inertia for a rotation taking place along the axis of the molecule) is negligible (i.e. &lt;math&gt;I_A &lt;&lt; I_B = I_C &lt;/math&gt;).
A general convention is to define the axes such that the axes &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has the smallest moment of inertia (and hence the highest rotational frequency) and other axes such that &lt;math&gt;I_A &lt;= I_B &lt;= I_C&lt;/math&gt;.
The particular pattern of [[energy level]]s (and hence of transitions in the rotational spectrum) for a molecule is determined by its symmetry. A convenient way to look at the molecules is to divide them into four different classes (based on the symmetry of their structure). These are,

# Linear molecules (or linear rotors)
# Symmetric tops (or symmetic rotors)
# Spherical tops (or spherical rotors) and
# Asymmetric tops

Dealing with each in turn:

# ''Linear molecules:''
#* As mentioned earlier, for a linear molecule &lt;math&gt;I_A &lt;&lt; I_B = I_C&lt;/math&gt;. For most of the purposes, &lt;math&gt;I_A&lt;/math&gt; is taken to be zero. For a linear molecule, the separation of lines in the rotational spectrum can be related directly to the moment of inertia of the molecule, and for a molecule of known atomic masses, can be used to determine the [[Bond_length|bond lengths]] (structure) directly. For [[diatomic|diatomic molecules]] this process is trivial, and can be made from a single measurement of the rotational spectrum. For linear molecules with more atoms, rather more work is required, and it is necessary to measure molecules in which more than one isotope of each atom have been substituted (effectively this gives rise to a set of simultaneous equations which can be solved for the [[Bond_length|bond lengths]]).
#* Examples or linear molecules: [[Oxygen|Oxygen (O=O)]], [[Carbon_monoxide|Carbon monoxide (O&amp;equiv;C&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)]], [[Hydroxyl_radical|Hydroxy radical (OH)]], [[Carbon_dioxide|Carbon dioxide (O=C=O)]], [[Hydrogen_cyanide|Hydrogen cyanide (HC&amp;equiv;N)]], [[Carbonyl_sulfide|Carbonyl sulfide (O=C=S)]], [[chloroethyne|Chloroethyne (HC&amp;equiv;CCl)]], [[Acetylene|Acetylene (HC&amp;equiv;CH)]]
# ''Symmetric tops:''
#*A symmetric top is a molecule in which two moments of inertia are the same. As a matter of historical convenience, spectroscopists divide molecules into two classes of symmetric tops, ''[[Oblate]] symmetric tops'' (saucer or disc shaped)  with &lt;math&gt;I_A = I_B &lt; I_C&lt;/math&gt; and ''[[Prolate]] symmetric tops'' (rugby football, or cigar shaped) with &lt;math&gt;I_A &lt; I_B = I_C&lt;/math&gt;. The spectra look rather different, and are instantly recognizable. As for linear molecules, the structure of ''symmetric tops'' ([[Bond_length|bond lengths]] and [[Molecular_geometry|bond angles]]) can be deduced from their spectra. 
#*Examples of symmetric tops: 
#** [[Oblate]]: [[Benzene|Benzene (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)]], [[Cyclobutadiene|Cyclobutadiene (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]]
#** [[Prolate]]: [[Chloroform|Chloroform (CHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]], [[Methylacetylene|Propyne (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&amp;equiv;CH)]], [[Ammonia|Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]]
# ''Spherical tops:''
#*A spherical top molecule, can be considered as a special case of ''symmetric tops'' with equal moment of inertia about all three axes (&lt;math&gt;I_A = I_B = I_C&lt;/math&gt;).
#*Examples of spherical tops: [[Phosphorus_tetramer|Phosphorus tetramer (P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]], [[Carbon_tetrachloride|Carbon tetrachloride (CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]], [[Nitrogen_tetrahydride|Nitrogen tetrahydride (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]], [[Ammonium|Ammonium ion (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)]], [[Sulfur_hexafluoride|Sulfur hexafluoride (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)]]
# ''Asymmetric tops:''
#*As you would have guessed a molecule is termed an asymmetric top if it has all three moments of inertia are different. Most of the larger molecules are asymmetric tops, even when they have a high degree of symmetry. Generally for such molecules a simple interpretation of the spectrum is not normally possible. Sometimes asymmetric tops have spectra that are similar to those of a linear molecule or a symmetric top, in which case the molecular structure must also be similar to that of a linear molecule or a symmetric top. For the most general case however, all that can be done is to fit the spectra to three different moments of inertia. If the molecular formula is known, then educated guesses can be made of the possible structure, and from this guessed structure, the moments of inertia can be calculated. If the calculated moments of inertia agree well with the measured moments of inertia, then the structure can be said to have been determined. For this approach to determining molecular structure, isotopic substitution is invaluable. 
#*Examples of asymmetric tops: [[Anthracene|Anthracene (C&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)]], [[Water_%28molecule%29|Water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)]], [[Nitrogen_dioxide|Nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]]

'''Hyperfine interactions''':

In addition to the main structure that is observed in microwave spectra that is due to the rotational motion of the molecules, a whole host of further interactions are responsible for small details in the spectra, and the study of these details provides a very deep understanding of molecular quantum mechanics. The main interactions responsible for small changes in the spectra (additional splittings and shifts of lines) are due to magnetic and electrostatic interactions in the molecule. The particular strength of such interactions differs in different molecules, but in general, the order of these effects (in decreasing significance) is:

(a) ''electron spin - electron spin interaction'' (this occurs in molecules with two or more unpaired electrons, and is a magnetic-dipole / magnetic-dipole interaction)

(b) ''electron spin - molecular rotation'' (the rotation of a molecule corresponds to a magnetic dipole, which interacts with the magnetic dipole moment of the electron)

(c) ''electron spin - nuclear spin interaction'' (the interaction between the magnetic dipole moment of the electron and the magnetic dipole moment of the nuclei (if present)).

(d) ''electric field gradient - nuclear electric quadrupole interaction'' (the interaction between the electric field gradient of the electron cloud of the molecule and the electric quadrupole moments of nuclei (if present)).

(e) ''nuclear spin - nuclear spin interaction'' (nuclear magnetic moments interacting with one another).

These interactions give rise to the characteristic energy levels that are probed in &quot;magnetic resonance&quot; spectroscopy such as [[NMR_spectroscopy|NMR]] and [[Electron_spin_resonance|ESR]], where they represent the &quot;zero field splittings&quot; which are always present.

==Rotational-Vibrational Spectroscopy==

[[Vibrational transition]]s occur in conjunction with [[rotational transition]]s. Consequently, it is possible to observe both rotational and [[vibrational transition]]s in the vibrational spectrum.  Although many methods are available for observing vibrational spectra, the two most common methods are [[infrared spectroscopy]] and [[Raman spectroscopy]].

The energy of rotational transitions is on the order of &lt;math&gt;10^{-21}&lt;/math&gt; J/mol whereas vibrational transitions have energies on the order of &lt;math&gt;10^{-20}&lt;/math&gt; J/mol.  Therefore, highly-resolved vibrational spectra will contain [[fine structure]] corresponding to the rotational transitions that occur at the same time as a vibrational transition.  Although molecular vibrations and rotations do have some effect on one other, this interaction is usually small.  Consequently, the rotational and vibrational contributions to the energy of the molecule can be considered independently to a first approximation:

&lt;math&gt; E_{vib,rot} = E_{vib} + E_{rot} = \left ( n + {1 \over 2} \right )h\nu_0 + hc\bar B J \left ( J + 1 \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; is the vibrational [[quantum number]], &lt;math&gt; J &lt;/math&gt; is the rotational [[quantum number]], h is [[Planck's constant]], &lt;math&gt;\nu_0&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the vibration, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]], and &lt;math&gt;\bar B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[rigid rotor|rotational constant]].

===Evaluating Spectra===
The image to the right shows the infrared spectrum of DCl.  All of the peaks in this spectrum correspond to a single vibrational transition. The reason that multiple peaks are observed is because of the various rotational transitions that can occur at the same time as the vibrational transition.  The peaks with a higher frequency are known as the R-branch and corresponds to transitions for which the rotational energy of the system increases (&lt;math&gt; \Delta J = 1 &lt;/math&gt;).  The peaks that correspond to lower frequencies are located on the left and are called the P-branch.  They represent transitions for which the rotational energy of the system decreases (&lt;math&gt; \Delta J = -1 &lt;/math&gt;).

The strict selection rule for the adsorption of dipole radiation (the strongest component of light) is that &lt;math&gt; \Delta J = 0,\pm 1 &lt;/math&gt;. This is because of the vector addition properties of quantum mechanical angular momenta, and because light particles (photons) have angular momenta of 1. 
For linear molecules the most usually observe case is that only transitions with  &lt;math&gt; \Delta J = \pm 1 &lt;/math&gt; are observed. This is only possible when the molecule has a &quot;singlet&quot; ground state, that is there are no unpaired electron spins in the molecule. For molecules that do have unpaired electrons, Q branches (see below) are commonly observed.

The gap between the R- and P-branches is known as the Q-branch.  A peak would appear here for a vibrational transition in which the rotational energy did not change (&lt;math&gt; \Delta J = 0 &lt;/math&gt;).  However, according to the quantum mechanical [[rigid rotor]] model upon which rotational spectroscopy is based, there is a spectroscopic [[selection rule]] that requires that &lt;math&gt; \Delta J = \pm 1 &lt;/math&gt;.  This selection rule explains why the P- and R-branches are observed, but not the Q-branch (as well as branches for which &lt;math&gt; \Delta J = \pm 2 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \Delta J = \pm 3 &lt;/math&gt;, etc.).

The positions of the peaks in the spectrum can be predicted using the [[rigid rotor]] model.  One prediction of the [[rigid rotor]] model is that the space between each of the peaks should be &lt;math&gt; 2\bar B &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \bar B &lt;/math&gt; is the [[rigid rotor|rotational constant]] for a given molecule.  Experimentally, it is observed that the spacing between the R-branch peaks decreases as the frequency increases.  Similarly, the spacing between the P-branch peaks increases as the frequency decreases.  This variation in the spacing results from the bonds between the atoms in a molecule not being entirely rigid.  

This variation can be mostly accounted for using a slightly more complex model that takes into account the variation in the rotational constant as the vibrational energy changes.  Using this model, the positions of the R-branch peaks are predicted to be at:

&lt;math&gt; \bar \nu_R = \nu_0 + 2\bar B_1 + \left ( 3\bar B_1 - \bar B_0 \right )J + \left ( \bar B_1 -\bar B_0 \right )J^2   \qquad    J = 0,1,2... &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \bar B_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the [[rigid rotor|rotational constant]] for the &lt;math&gt; n = 0 &lt;/math&gt; vibrational level and &lt;math&gt; \bar B_1 &lt;/math&gt; is the [[rigid rotor|rotational constant]] for the &lt;math&gt; n = 1 &lt;/math&gt; vibrational level.  Likewise, the P-branch peaks are predicted to be at:

&lt;math&gt; \bar \nu_P = \bar \nu_0 - \left ( \bar B_1 + \bar B_0 \right )J + \left ( \bar B_1 - \bar B_0 \right )J^2   \qquad     J = 1,2,3... &lt;/math&gt;

Rotational-vibrational spectra will also show some fine structure due to the presence of different [[isotopes]] in the spectrum.  In the spectrum shown above, all of the rotational peaks are slightly split into two peaks.  One peak corresponds to &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl and the other to &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Cl.  The ratio of the peak intensities corresponds to the [[natural abundance]] of these two isotopes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Rovibronic coupling''' denotes the simultaneous interactions between rotational, vibrational, and electronic degrees of freedom in a molecule. When a rovibronic transition occurs, the rotational, vibrational, and electronic states change simultaneously, unlike in rovibrational coupling. The coupling can be observed spectroscopically and is most easily seen in the Renner-Teller effect in which a linear polyatomic molecule is in a degenerate electronic state and bending vibrations will cause a large Rovibronic coupling.

The '''Rydberg constant''', named after [[physicist]] [[Johannes Rydberg|Johannes Rydberg]], is a [[physical constant]] that apperas in the [[Rydberg formula]]. It was discovered when measuring the [[optical spectrum|spectrum]] of [[hydrogen]], and building upon results from [[Anders Jonas Ångström]] and [[Johann Balmer]]. Each [[chemical element]] has its own Rydberg constant, which can be derived from the &quot;infinity&quot; Rydberg constant.

The Rydberg constant is one of the most well-determined physical constants with a relative experimental uncertainty of less than 7 parts per trillion. The ability to measure it directly to such a high precision confirms the proportions of the values of the other physical constants that define it.

For a series of discrete spectral lines emitted by atmoic hydrogen,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\lambda}=R\left(\frac{1}{m^2}-\frac{1}{n^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The &quot;infinity&quot; Rydberg constant is (according to 2002 [[CODATA]] results):

:&lt;math&gt;R_\infty = \frac{m_e e^4}{(4 \pi \epsilon_0)^2 \hbar^3 4 \pi c} = 1.0973731568525(73) \cdot 10^7 \,\mathrm{m}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
:::where
:::: &lt;math&gt; \hbar \ &lt;/math&gt; is the reduced [[Planck's constant]],
:::: &lt;math&gt; m_e \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[rest mass]] of the [[electron]],
:::: &lt;math&gt;e \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[elementary charge]],
:::: &lt;math&gt; c \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in [[vacuum]], and
:::: &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_0 \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[permittivity of free space]].

This constant is often used in [[atomic physics]] in the form of an energy:
:&lt;math&gt;h c R_\infty = 13.6056923(12) \,\mathrm{eV} \equiv 1 \,\mathrm{Ry}&lt;/math&gt;

The &quot;infinity&quot; constant appears in the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;R_M = \frac{R_\infty}{1+\frac{m_e}{M}}&lt;/math&gt;
:::where
::::&lt;math&gt;R_M&lt;/math&gt; is the Rydberg constant for a certain [[atom]] with one [[electron]] with the [[rest mass]] &lt;math&gt;m_e \ &lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;M \ &lt;/math&gt; is the mass of its [[atomic nucleus]].

==Alternate expressions==

The Rydberg constant can also be expressed as the following equations.

:&lt;math&gt;R_\infty = \frac{\alpha^2 m_e c}{4 \pi \hbar} = \frac{\alpha^2}{2 \lambda_e} &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;h c R_\infty = \frac{h c \alpha^2}{2 \lambda_e} = \frac{h f_C \alpha^2}{2} = \frac{\hbar \omega_C}{2} \alpha^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where
:: &lt;math&gt; h \ &lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]],
:: &lt;math&gt; c \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum,
:: &lt;math&gt; \alpha \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[fine-structure constant]],
:: &lt;math&gt; \lambda_e \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Compton wavelength]] of the electron,
:: &lt;math&gt; f_C \ &lt;/math&gt; is the Compton frequency of the electron,
:: &lt;math&gt; \hbar \ &lt;/math&gt; is the reduced [[Planck's constant]], and
:: &lt;math&gt; \omega_C \ &lt;/math&gt; is the Compton angular frequency of the electron.

== Rydberg Constant for hydrogen ==

Plugging in the rest mass of an electron and an atomic mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; of 1 for hydrogen, we find the Rydberg constant for hydrogen, &lt;math&gt; R_H &lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; R_H = 10967758 \pm 1 m^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;

Plugging this constant into the [[Rydberg formula]], we can obtain the emission spectrum of hydrogen.

== Derivation of Rydberg Constant==
The Rydberg Constant can be derived using Bohr's condition, centripetal acceleration, and Potential Energy of the electron to the nucleus.

Bohr's condition, 

:&lt;math&gt; 2 \pi r = n \lambda &lt;/math&gt;
where 
::&lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; is some integer
::&lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; is the radius of some atom

Centripetal Acceleration,

:&lt;math&gt; PE = \frac{mv^2}{r} &lt;/math&gt;
where
:: &lt;math&gt; m_e \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[rest mass]] of the [[electron]],
::&lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; is the electron's velocity

PE of Attraction between Electron and Nucleus

:&lt;math&gt; PE = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_o r^2 }&lt;/math&gt;
where
:: &lt;math&gt;e \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[elementary charge]],
:: &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_o \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[permittivity of free space]].

Firstly we substitute &lt;math&gt; \lambda  = \frac{h}{p} &lt;/math&gt; into Bohr's condition, then solve for &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt;
We obtain &lt;math&gt; v^2 = \frac {n^2h^2}{4 \pi^2 r^2 m^2} &lt;/math&gt;

We equate centripetal acceleration and attraction between nucleus to obtain &lt;math&gt; \frac{mv^2}{r} = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_o r^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

Substitute &lt;math&gt; v^2 &lt;/math&gt; in and solve for &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; we obtain &lt;math&gt; r = \frac{n^2h^2 \epsilon_o }{ \pi m e^2} &lt;/math&gt;

We know that &lt;math&gt; E_{total} = - \frac {e^2}{ 8 \pi \epsilon_o r} &lt;/math&gt;

Substitute &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; into this energy equation and we get
&lt;math&gt; E_{total} = \frac{- m e^4}{8 \epsilon_o^2 h^2}. \frac{1}{n^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore a chance in energy would be 
&lt;math&gt; \Delta E = \frac{ m e^4}{8 \epsilon_o^2 h^2} ( \frac{1}{n_{initial}^2} - \frac{1}{n_{final}^2})&lt;/math&gt;

We simply change the units to wave number (&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{ \lambda} = \frac {E}{hc} &lt;/math&gt;) and we get 
&lt;math&gt; \Delta \tilde{\nu} = \frac{ m_e e^4}{8 \epsilon_o^2 h^3 c}( \frac{1}{n_{initial}^2} - \frac{1}{n_{final}^2})&lt;/math&gt;
where
:: &lt;math&gt; h \ &lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]],
:: &lt;math&gt; m_e \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[rest mass]] of the [[electron]],
:: &lt;math&gt;e \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[elementary charge]],
:: &lt;math&gt; c \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in [[vacuum]], and
:: &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_o \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[permittivity of free space]].
:: &lt;math&gt; n_{initial}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; n_{final}&lt;/math&gt; being the excited states of the atom
We have therefore find the Rydberg constant for Hydrogen to be

&lt;math&gt; R_H = \frac{ m e^4}{8 \epsilon_o^2 h^3 c} &lt;/math&gt;

The '''Rydberg-Ritz Combination Principle''' is the theory proposed by [[Walter Ritz]] in 1908 to explain relationship of the spectral lines for all atoms.  The principle states that the [[Spectroscopy|spectral lines]] of any element include [[Frequency|frequencies]] that are either the sum or the difference of the frequencies of two other lines.

An atom can be [[Excitation|excited]] to higher [[energy]] either spontaneously or via [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of a [[photon]].  However, according to the principles of [[Quantum mechanics]], these excitations can only occur at certain energy intervals.  The Rydberg–Ritz combination principle helps explain this process.

== History ==
The spectral lines of [[hydrogen]] had been analyzed and found to have a mathematical relationship in the [[Balmer series]].  This was later extended to a general formula called the [[Rydberg formula]].  This could only be applied to hydrogen-like atoms.  In 1908 Ritz derived a relationship that could be applied to all atoms.  This principle, the Rydberg–Ritz combination principle, is used today in identifying the transition lines of atoms.

The  '''sample preparation for mass spectrometry''' is used for the optimisation of a sample for the analysis in a [[mass spectrometer]] (MS).
These have depending on their [[ion source]] different requirements for volume, [[concentration]], and composition of the [[analyte]] solution. Furthermore, in [[protein mass spectrometry]] usually the [[protein]] of interest is cleaved into peptides before analysis, either by [[in-gel digestion]] or by [[proteolysis]] in solution.
==Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization==
For [[matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI) mass spectrometry the sample is usually mixed with a [[Matrix (chemical analysis)|matrix]] solution and spotted on the target plate.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18978997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fenyo D, Wang Q, DeGrasse JA, Padovan JC, Cadene M, Chait BT |title=MALDI sample preparation: the ultra thin layer method |journal=J Vis Exp |volume= |issue=3 |pages=192 |year=2007 |pmid=18978997 |pmc=2535834 |doi=10.3791/192}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matrix [[Crystallization|crystallises]] together with the sample and the analyte [[molecule]]s are transferred to the [[gas phase]] by the pulsed [[laser]] irradiation.

The concentration of salt in the sample is thereby not so critical as it is for [[electrospray ionization]]. However, interfering signals are observed due to side reactions of the matrix with [[alkali metal]] ions which can impair the analysis of the spectra.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14528495&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Xu Y, Bruening ML, Watson JT |title=Non-specific, on-probe cleanup methods for MALDI-MS samples |journal=Mass Spectrom Rev |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=429–40 |year=2003 |pmid=14528495 |doi=10.1002/mas.10064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a separate desalting step is usually not necessary as in previous steps of sample preparation e.g. [[in-gel digestion]] of [[protein]]s, the selection of appropriate [[buffer]] salts prevents the occurrence of this problem. Furthermore the crystallised matrix/analyte mixture allows removing of salts by washing on the target and the addition of [[ammonium phosphate]] before crystallisation can improve the signal quality. &lt;ref name=&quot;Smirnov et al.&quot;&gt;''[http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/ancham/2004/76/i10/abs/ac035331j.html Smirnov et al., Anal. Chem., 76 (10), S. 2958-2965, 2004]''&lt;/ref&gt;

MALDI matrices used for identifying peptides include CHCA and DHB. These solutions are typically saturated solutions in a 50% Acetonitrile/0.1% TFA; TFA being the protonating agent. Typically the sample solution and matrix solution is mixed in a 1:1 ratio and then a half a microliter to a microliter is added to the MALDI plate. Proteins use SA (sinapinic acid) as their matrix; which is prepared in the same way as the peptide matricies. 
==Electrospray ionization==
[[Electrospray ionization]] because of its principle of ionization is more demanding in the characteristics of the sample.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19003789&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Du L, White RL |title=Improved partition equilibrium model for predicting analyte response in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry |journal=J Mass Spectrom |volume= 44|issue= 2|pages= n/a|year=2008 |month=November |pmid=19003789 |doi=10.1002/jms.1501}}&lt;/ref&gt; In off-line measurements (in contrast to on-line measurements using [[LC-MS]]), the analyte solution is applied by a spray capillary to the mass spectrometer. This capillary allows for the application of volumes in the nanoliter range; however, the detection limit of the instrument requires in protein analysis a relatively high concentration of the analyte.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} Therefore, usually a step to increase the concentration of the sample is needed.

The evaporation of the solvent in the spray during the ionization process accounts for the demand of a salt-free analyte solution. Otherwise, with the continuous reduction of the volume of the droplets in the spray the salts would start to aggregate which inhibits the formation of useful analyte ions for the measurement.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

A major application for ESI is the field of [[protein mass spectrometry]]. Here, the MS is used for the identification and sizing of proteins. The identification of a protein sample can be done in an ESI-MS by [[de novo sequencing]] (using [[tandem mass spectrometry]]) or [[peptide mass fingerprinting]]. Both methods require the previous digestion of proteins to peptides, mostly accomplished enzymatically using [[protease]]s. As well for the digestion in solution as for the [[in-gel digestion]] buffered solutions are needed, whose content in salts is to high and in analyte is to low for a successful ESI-MS measurement. Therefore, a combined desalting and concentration step is performed. Usually a [[HPLC|reversed phase liquid chromatography]] is used, in which the peptides stay bound to the [[chromatography]] matrix whereas the salts are removed by washing. The peptides can be eluted from the matrix by the use of a small volume of a solution containing a large portion of [[organic compound|organic]] solvent, which results in the reduction of the final volume of the analyte. In [[LC-MS]] the desalting/concentration is realised with a pre-column, in off-line measurements reversed phase micro columns are used, which can be used directly with  microliter [[pipettes]]. Here, the peptides are eluted with the spray solution containing an appropriate portion of organic solvent. The resulting solution (usually a few microliters)is enriched with the analyte and, after transfer to the spray capillary, can be directly used in the MS.

'''Secondary ion mass spectrometry''' (SIMS) is a technique used in [[materials science]] and [[surface science]] to analyze the composition of solid surfaces and [[thin film]]s by [[sputtering]] the surface of the specimen with a focused primary [[ion beam]] and collecting and analyzing ejected secondary ions. These secondary ions are measured with a [[mass spectrometer]] to determine the elemental, isotopic, or molecular composition of the surface. SIMS is the most sensitive surface analysis technique, being able to detect elements present in the parts per billion range.

==History==
In 1910 British physicist [[J. J. Thomson]] observed a release of positive ions and neutral atoms from a solid surface induced by ion bombardment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Rays of positive electricity|author = Thomson, J. J |journal= Phil. Mag.|volume= 20|year=1910|pages=752–767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improved [[vacuum pump]] technology in the 1940s enabled the first prototype experiments on SIMS by Herzog and Viehböck&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Ion source for mass spectrography|author =Herzog, R. F. K., Viehboeck, F |journal = Phys. Rev.|volume= 76|year=1949|pages=855–856|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.76.855}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1949, at the [[University of Vienna]], Austria. Then in the early 1960s two SIMS instruments were developed independently. One was an American project, led by Liebel and Herzog, which was sponsored by [[NASA]] at GCA Corp, Massachusetts, for analyzing [[moon rock]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =Ion microprobe mass analyzer|doi=10.1063/1.1709314 |author =Liebl, H. J |journal = J. Appl. Phys.|volume= 38|year=1967|pages=5277–5280}}&lt;/ref&gt; the other at the [[University of Paris-Sud in Orsay]] by R. Castaing for the PhD thesis of G. Slodzian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =Optique corpusculaire—premiers essais de microanalyse par emission ionique secondaire|author =Castaing, R. &amp; Slodzian, G. J |journal =Microscopie|volume= 1|year=1962|pages=395–399}}&lt;/ref&gt; These first instruments were based on a magnetic double focusing [[sector instrument|sector field mass spectrometer]] and used argon for the primary beam ions. In the 1970s, K. Wittmack and C. Magee developed SIMS instruments equipped with [[quadrupole mass analyzer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author =Wittmaack, K.|title =Pre-equilibrium variation of secondary ion yield|journal =Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Phys. |volume=17|year=1975|pages=39–50| doi =10.1016/0020-7381(75)80005-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author =Magee, C. W. et al.|title =Secondary ion quadrupole mass spectrometer for depth profiling design and performance evaluation |journal =Rev. Scient. Instrum. |volume=49|year=1978|pages=477–485|pmid=18699129| doi =10.1063/1.1135438| issue =4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, A. Benninghoven introduced the method of [[#Static and dynamic modes|static SIMS]], where the primary ion current density is so small that only a negligible fraction (typically 1%) of the first surface layer is necessary for surface analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Analysis of sub-monolayers on silver by secondary ion emission|doi=10.1002/pssb.19690340267|author =Benninghoven, A |journal = Physica Status Solidi |volume=34|year=1969|pages=K169–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instruments of this type use pulsed primary ion sources and [[time-of-flight mass spectrometry|time-of-flight mass spectrometers]] and were developed by Benninghoven, Niehus and Steffens at the [[University of Münster]], [[Germany]] and also by Charles Evans &amp; Associates. Recent developments are focusing on novel primary ion species like [[fullerene|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] or ionized clusters of [[gold]] and [[bismuth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =Sputter-depth profiling for thin-film analysis|doi=10.1098/rsta.2003.1304| author =S.Hofmann|journal =Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A |year=2004|volume=362|pages=55–75| pmid =15306276| issue =1814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
[[Image:SIMS instrument scheme 600x600.png|thumb|300px|Typical schematic of a dynamical SIMS instrument. High energy ions are supplied by an ion gun (1 or 2) and focused on to the target sample (3), which ionizes and sputters some atoms off the surface. These secondary ions are then collected by ion lenses (5) and filtered according to atomic mass (6), then projected onto an electron multiplier (7, top), Faraday cup (7, bottom), or CCD screen (8).]]

Typically, a secondary ion mass spectrometer consists of: 
*primary ion gun generating the primary ion beam
*primary ion column, accelerating and focusing the beam onto the sample (and in some devices an opportunity to separate the primary ion species by [[Wien filter]] or to pulse the beam)
*high [[vacuum]] sample chamber holding the sample and the secondary ion extraction lens
*mass analyser separating the ions according to their mass to charge ratio
*ion detection unit.

===Vacuum===

SIMS requires a [[vacuum|high vacuum]] with pressures below 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] (roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; [[mbar]] or [[torr]]). This is needed to ensure that secondary ions do not collide with background gases on their way to the detector (i.e. the [[mean free path]] of gas molecules within the detector must be large compared to the size of the instrument), and it also prevents surface contamination by [[adsorption]] of background gas particles during measurement.

===Primary ion sources===

There are three basic types of ion guns. In one, ions of gaseous elements are usually generated with [[Duoplasmatron]]s or by [[electron ionization]], for instance [[noble gas]]es ([[Argon|Ar]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Xenon|Xe]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), or even ionized molecules such as SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (generated from [[Sulfur hexafluoride|SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]]) or C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. This type of ion gun is easy to operate and generates roughly focused but high current ion beams. A second source type, the [http://www.eaglabs.com/training/tutorials/sims_instrumentation_tutorial/sources.php surface ionization source], generates Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; primary ions. Caesium atoms vaporize through a porous tungsten plug and are ionized during evaporation. Depending on the gun design, fine focus or high current can be obtained. A third source type, the [[liquid metal ion source]] (LMIG), operates with metals or metallic alloys, which are liquid at room temperature or slightly above. The liquid metal covers a [[tungsten]] tip and emits ions under influence of an intense electric field. While a gallium source is able to operate with elemental gallium, recently developed sources for gold, [[indium]] and bismuth use alloys which lower their [[melting point]]s. The LMIG provides a tightly focused ion beam (&lt;50&amp;nbsp;nm) with moderate intensity and is additionally able to generate short pulsed ion beams. It is therefore commonly used in static SIMS devices.

The choice of the ion species and ion gun respectively depends on the required current (pulsed or continuous), the required beam dimensions of the primary ion beam and on the sample which is to be analyzed. Oxygen primary ions are often used to investigate electropositive elements due to an increase of the generation probability of positive secondary ions, while caesium primary ions often are used when electronegative elements are being investigated. For short pulsed ion beams in static SIMS, only LMIGs are deployable, but they are often combined with either an oxygen gun or a caesium gun for sample depletion.

===Mass analyzers===

Dependent on the SIMS type, there are three basic analyzers available: sector, quadrupole, and time-of-flight. A [[sector instrument|sector field mass spectrometer]] uses a combination of an electrostatic analyzer and a magnetic analyzer to separate the secondary ions by their mass to charge ratio. A [[quadrupole mass analyzer]] separates the masses by resonant electric fields, which allow only the selected masses to pass through. The [[Time-of-flight mass spectrometry|time of flight mass analyzer]] separates the ions in a field-free drift path according to their [[kinetic energy]]. It requires pulsed secondary ion generation using either a pulsed primary ion gun or a pulsed secondary ion extraction. It is the only analyzer type able to detect all generated secondary ions simultaneously, and is the standard analyzer for static SIMS instruments.

===Detectors===
A [[Faraday cup]] measures the ion current hitting a metal cup, and is sometimes used for high current secondary ion signals. With an [[electron multiplier]] an impact of a single ion starts off an electron cascade, resulting in a pulse of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; electrons which is recorded directly. A [[microchannel plate detector]] is similar to an electron multiplier, with lower amplification factor but with the advantage of laterally-resolved detection. Usually it is combined with a [[fluorescent]] screen, and signals are recorded either with a CCD-camera or with a fluorescence detector.

==Detection limits and sample degradation==

[[Detection limit]]s for most trace elements are between 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; atoms per [[cubic centimeter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SIMS Detection Limits of Selected Elements in Si and SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Under Normal Depth Profiling Conditions|date=May 4, 2007|publisher=Evans Analytical Group|url =http://www.eaglabs.com/files/appnotes/AN339.pdf|accessdate = 2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the type of instrumentation used, the primary ion beam used and the analytical area, and other factors. Samples as small as individual pollen grains and microfossils can yield results by this technique.&lt;ref name=Kaufman2003&gt;{{cite journal|author = Kaufman, A.J.|coauthors = Xiao, S.|year = 2003|title = High CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels in the Proterozoic atmosphere estimated from analyses of individual microfossils|journal = Nature|volume = 425|pages = 279–282|doi = 10.1038/nature01902|pmid = 13679912|issue = 6955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of surface cratering created by the process depends on the current (pulsed or continuous) and dimensions of the primary ion beam. While only charged secondary ions emitted from the material surface through the sputtering process are used to analyze the chemical composition of the material, these represent a small fraction of the particles emitted from the sample.

==Static and dynamic modes==

In the field of surface analysis, it is usual to distinguish ''[[static SIMS]]'' and ''dynamic SIMS''. Static SIMS is the process involved in surface atomic monolayer analysis, usually with a pulsed ion beam and a time of flight mass spectrometer, while dynamic SIMS is the process involved in bulk analysis, closely related to the [[sputtering]] process, using a DC primary ion beam and a magnetic sector or quadrupole mass spectrometer.

==Applications==

The COSIMA instrument onboard [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]] will be the first instrument to determine the composition of cometary dust with secondary ion mass spectrometry in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= Chemometric evaluation of time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry data of minerals in the frame of future in situ analyses of cometary’s material by COSIMA onboard ROSETTA|author=C.

[[Image:Jeol 5sector.jpg|right|thumb|300 px|A five sector mass spectrometer]]
A '''sector instrument''' is a general term for a class of [[mass spectrometer]] that uses a static electric or magnetic sector or some combination of the two (separately in space) as a mass analyzer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/E01938.pdf IUPAC definition of electric sector]&lt;/ref&gt; A popular combination of these sectors has been the BEB (magnetic-electric-magnetic).  Most modern sector instruments are double focusing instruments in that they focus the ion beams both in direction and velocity.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last= Burgoyne |first=Thomas W. |authorlink= |coauthors=Gary M. Hieftje |year= 1996 |month= |title= An introduction to ion optics for the mass spectrograph|journal=[[Mass Spectrometry Reviews]] |volume=15 |issue= |pages=241–259 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2787(1996)15:4&lt;241::AID-MAS2&gt;3.0.CO;2-I |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/10009446/ABSTRACT|format= abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
The behavior of ions in a homogeneous, linear, static electric or magnetic field (separately) as is found in a sector instrument is simple. The [[physics]] are described by a single equation called the [[Lorentz force]] law. This equation is the fundamental equation of all mass specrometric techniques and applies in non-linear, non-homogeneous cases too and is an important equation in the field of [[electrodynamics]] generally.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q (\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}),&lt;/math&gt;

where '''E''' is the [[electric field]] strength, '''B''' is the [[magnetic field]] induction, ''q'' is the charge of the particle, '''v''' is its current [[velocity]] (expressed as a vector), and &amp;times; is the [[cross product]]. 

So the [[force]] on an ion in a linear homogeous electric field (an electric sector) is:

:&lt;math&gt;F=qE\,&lt;/math&gt;, 

in the direction of the electric field, with positive ions and opposite that with negative ions.

[[Image:Sector.jpg|right|thumb|250 px|Electric sector from a Finnigan MAT mass spectrometer (vacuum chamber housing removed)]]

The force is only dependent on the charge and electric field strength. The lighter ions will be deflected more and heavier ions less due to the difference in [[inertia]] and the ions will physically separate from each other in space into distinct beams of ions as they exit the electric sector.

And the force on an ion in a linear homogeous magnetic field (a magnetic sector) is:

:&lt;math&gt;F=qvB\,&lt;/math&gt;, 

perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the velocity vector of the ion itself, in the direction determined by the [[right-hand rule]] of [[cross product]]s and the sign of the charge.

The force in the magnetic sector is complicated by the velocity dependence but with the right conditions (uniform velocity for example) ions of different masses will separate physically in space into different beams as with the electric sector.

== Classic Geometries ==
These are some of the classic geometries from mass spectrographs which are often used to distinguish different types of sector arrangements, although most current instruments do not fit precisely into any of these categories as the designs have evolved further.

===Bainbridge-Jordan===
The sector instrument geometry consists of a 127.30° &lt;math&gt;\left (\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}} \right)&lt;/math&gt; electric sector without an initial drift length followed by a 60° magnetic sector with the same direction of curvature. Sometimes called a &quot;Bainbridge mass spectrometer,&quot; this configuration is often used to determine [[Isotope|isotopic]] [[Atomic mass|masses]]. A beam of [[proton|positive particles]] is produced from the isotope under study. The beam is subject to the combined action of perpendicular [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic fields]]. Since the forces due to these two fields are equal and opposite, the particles with a [[velocity]] given by

:&lt;math&gt;v=E/B\,&lt;/math&gt;

do not experience a resultant [[force]]; they pass freely through a slit, and are then subject to another magnetic field, transversing a semi-circular path and striking a [[photographic plate]]. The mass of the isotope is determined through subsequent calculation.

===Mattauch-Herzog===
The Mattauch-Herzog geometry consists of a 31.82° (&lt;math&gt;\pi  / 4\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; radians) electric sector, a drift length which is followed by a 90° magnetic sector of opposite curvature direction.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|title=The theory of a mass-spectrograph with double focus independent of mass.|journal= Zeitschrift fuer Naturforschung|date=1946|first=Alfred|last=Klemm|coauthors=|volume=1|issue=|pages=137–41|id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry of the ions sorted primarily by charge into the magnetic field produces an energy focussing effect and much higher transmission than a standard energy filter. This geometry is often used in applications with a high energy spread in the ions produced where sensitivity is nonetheless required, such as spark source mass spectrometry (SSMS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16808438&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schilling GD, Andrade FJ, Barnes JH, Sperline RP, Denton MB, Barinaga CJ, Koppenaal DW, Hieftje GM |title=Characterization of a second-generation focal-plane camera coupled to an inductively coupled plasma Mattauch-Herzog geometry mass spectrograph |journal=Anal. Chem. |volume=78 |issue=13 |pages=4319–25 |year=2006 |pmid=16808438 |doi=10.1021/ac052026k}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The advantage of this geometry over the Nier-Johnson geometry is that the ions of different masses are all focused onto the same flat plane.  This allows the use of a photographic plate or other flat detector array.

===Nier-Johnson===
The Nier-Johnson geometry consists of a 90° electric sector, a long intermediate drift length and a 60° magnetic sector of the same curvature direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title=Alfred Nier and the sector field mass spectrometer | author=De Laeter, J. &amp; Kurz, M. D. | year=2006 | journal=[[Journal of Mass Spectrometry]] | volume=41(7) | pages=847–854 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='1991, 63, 1546; O.B. 201'&gt; {{cite web|url=http://iupac.org/goldbook/N04141.pdf |title=Nier-Johnson geometry |accessdate=2007-09-13 |date=1997 |format=PDF |work=IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology |publisher=IUPAC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinterberger-Konig===
The Hinterberger-Konig geometry consists of a 42.43° electric sector, a long intermediate drift length and a 130° magnetic sector of the same curvature direction.

===Takeshita===
The Takeshita geometry consists of a  54.43° electric sector, and short drift length, a second electric sector of the same curvature direction followed by another drift length before a 180° magnetic sector of opposite curvature direction.

===Matsuda===
The Matsuda geometry consists of a 85° electric sector, a quadrupole lens and a 72.5° magnetic sector of the same curvature direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|4553029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry''' is a sensitive and quantitative [[mass spectrometry]] technique for trace gas analyses using chemical ionisation of sample trace gases by selected positive ions during a well-defined time period along a flow tube. Absolute concentrations of trace compounds in humid air or breath are calculated in real time from the reagent and product ion signal ratios without the need for calibration using standards. SIFT-MS is primarily used for on-line quantification of trace gases in human [[breath]] for clinical [[diagnosis]] and therapeutic monitoring. SIFT-MS has also great potential as a tool for non- invasive physiological monitoring. Other valuable applications are now emerging in agriculture and animal husbandry, [[natural environment|environmental]] research and food technology.

==Instrumentation==
The selected ion flow tube, SIFT, technique is a fast flow tube / ion swarm method to react positive or negative ions with atoms and molecules under truly thermalised conditions over a wide range of temperature. It has been extensively used to study ionmolecule kinetics. Its application to [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] and interstellar ion chemistry over a 20-year period has been crucial to the advancement and understanding of these interesting topics. 

In the SIFT-MS instrument the [[ions]] are created in an [[microwave plasma]] ion source which is external to the flow tube. The ions are then extracted from the ion source, selected according to their mass-to-charge ratio using a [[Quadrupole mass analyzer|quadrupole]] mass filter and injected into a flowing carrier gas (usually [[helium]] at a pressure of 0.5 to 1 Torr) via a small orifice ( ~1&amp;nbsp;mm diameter).

The carrier gas is inhibited from entering the [[Quadrupole mass analyzer|quadrupole]] mass filter chamber by injecting it into the flow tube through a [[Venturi pump|Venturi]]-type inlet at near-supersonic velocity in a direction away from the orifice. In this way a swarm of a single ion species thermalised at the same temperature as the carrier gas are convected along the flow tube (50 to 400&amp;nbsp;mm long), sampled by a downstream pinhole orifice, mass analysed and counted by a differentially-pumped quadrupole [[mass spectrometer]] system.

The '''sensitive high resolution ion microprobe''' ('''SHRIMP''') is a large-diameter, double focusing [[Secondary ion mass spectrometry|secondary ion mass spectrometer]] (SIMS) instrument produced by Australian Scientific Instruments in [[Canberra, Australia]]. The SHRIMP [[microprobe]] uses a beam of [[ions]] to produce [[secondary ion]]s, which are separated by mass and energy by the mass spectrometer and measured by a collector.

==Applications==
The SHRIMP is primarily used for geological and geochemical applications. It can rapidly measure the isotopic and elemental abundances in minerals at a scale as small as 5 μm and is therefore particularly well-suited for the analysis of complex minerals, as often found in [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] terrains, some [[igneous rock]]s, and detrital minerals in sedimentary rocks. The most common application of the instrument is in U-Th-Pb [[geochronology]], although the SHRIMP can be used to measure other [[isotope|isotopic]] and elemental abundances.  The [[Second Generation|second generation]] instrument (SHRIMP II) is currently commercially produced by Australian Scientific Instruments in Canberra, in association with the [[Australian National University]] &lt;ref&gt;Williams, I.S., 1998. U-Th-Pb geochronology by ion microprobe. In: M.A. McKibben, W.C. Shanks III and W.I. Ridley (Editors), Applications of microanalytical techniques to understanding mineralizing processes. Reviews in [[Economic geology|Economic Geology]], pp. 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Isotope dating==
For U-Th-Pb [[geochronology]] a beam of primary ions (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) are mass analyzed, collimated and accelerated towards the target, and used to sputter “secondary” ions from the sample. These secondary ions are accelerated along the instrument where the various isotopes of [[uranium]], [[lead]] and [[thorium]] are measured successively, along with reference peaks for Zr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, ThO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and UO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Since the sputtering yield differs between ion species and relative sputtering yield increases or decreases with time depending on the ion species (due to increasing crater depth, charging effects and other factors), the measured relative isotopic abundances do not relate to the real relative isotopic abundances in the target. Corrections are determined by analysing unknowns and standard material (matrix-matched material of known isotopic composition), and determining an analytical-session specific calibration factor&lt;ref&gt;Claoué-Long, J., Compston, W., Roberts, J. and Fanning, C.M., 1995.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Sequential walking''' is a technique that can be used to solve various 2D NMR spectra.  In a 2D experiment, cross peaks must be correlated to the correct nuclei.  Using sequential walking, the correct nuclei can be assigned to their crosspeaks.  The assigned crosspeaks can give valuable information such as spatial interactions between nuclei.

In a NOESY of DNA, for example, each nucleotide has a different chemical shift associated with it.  In general, A's are more downstream, T's are more upstream, and C's and G's are intermediate.  Each nucleotide has protons on the deoxyribose sugar, which can be assigned using sequential walking.  To do this, the first nucleotide in the sequence must be detected.  Knowing the DNA sequence helps, but in general the first nucleotide can be determined using the following rules.

1. 2' and 2&quot; protons of a nucleotide will show up in its column, as well as in the column of the next nucleotide in the sequence.  For example, in the sequence CATG, in the column for C, its own 2' and 2&quot; protons will be seen, but none of the other nucleotides.  For A, its own 2' and 2&quot; protons will be seen, as well as those from C.

2. Methyl groups on the nucleotide are seen in the column for the nucleotide containing a methyl group, as well as for the nucleotide preceding it.  For example, in CATG, the A and T will contain the methyl peak corresponding to the methyl group on T, but G will not.

Once the first nucleotide has been found, you determine which nucleotide is next to it because it should contain the 2' and 2&quot; protons form the previous nucleotide.  This is done by &quot;walking&quot; across the spectrum.  This process is then repeated sequentially until all nucleotides have been assigned.

[[Image:Silac.gif|right|thumb|420px|'''The principle of SILAC'''. Cells differentially labeled by growing them in light medium with normal arginine (Arg-0, grey colour) or medium with heavy arginine (Arg-6, red colour). Metabolic incorporation of the amino acids into the proteins results in a mass shift of the corresponding peptides. This mass shift can be detected by a [[mass spectrometer]] as indicated by the depicted mass spectra. When both samples are combined, the ratio of peak intensities in the mass spectrum reflects the relative protein abundance. In this example, the labeled protein has the same abundance in both samples (ratio 1).]]

'''SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture)''' is a technique based on [[mass spectrometry]] that detects differences in protein abundance among samples using non-radioactive [[isotopic labeling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jiang H, English, AM | year=2002 |title=Quantitative Analysis of the Yeast Proteome by Incorporation of Isotopically Labeled Leucine |journal=Journal of Proteome Research |volume=1 |pages=345–50 |pmid=12645890 |url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr025523f |doi=10.1021/pr025523f |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ong SE, Blagoev B, Kratchmarova I, Kristensen DB, Steen H, Pandey A, Mann M | year=2002 |title=Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, SILAC, as a simple and accurate approach to expression proteomics |journal=Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics |volume=1 |pages=376–86 |pmid=12118079 |url=http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/abstract/1/5/376 |doi=10.1074/mcp.M200025-MCP200 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhu H, Pan S, Gu S, Bradbury EM, Chen X | year=2002 |title=Amino acid residue specific stable isotope labeling for quantitative proteomics |journal=Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry |volume=16 |pages=2115–23 |pmid=12415544 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/99018948/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |doi=10.1002/rcm.831 |issue=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a popular method for [[quantitative proteomics]]. 

==Procedure==
Two populations of cells are cultivated in [[cell culture]]. One of the cell populations is fed with [[growth medium]] containing normal [[amino acids]]. In contrast, the second population is fed with growth medium containing amino acids labeled with stable (non-radioactive) heavy [[isotope]]s. For example, the medium can contain [[arginine]] labeled with six [[carbon-13]] atoms (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) instead of the normal [[carbon-12]] (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C). When the cells are growing in this medium, they incorporate the heavy arginine into all of their proteins. Therefore, all of the arginine containing peptides are now 6 Da heavier than their normal counterparts. The trick is that the proteins from both cell populations can be combined and analyzed together by [[mass spectrometry]]. Pairs of chemically identical peptides of different stable-isotope composition can be differentiated in a mass spectrometer owing to their mass difference. The ratio of peak intensities in the mass spectrum for such peptide pairs reflects the abundance ratio for the two proteins. 

==Applications==
A SILAC approach involving incorporation of [[tyrosine]] labeled with nine [[carbon-13]] atoms (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) instead of the normal [[carbon-12]] (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C) has been utilized to study tyrosine kinase substrates in signaling pathways.&lt;ref name= PM14739304 &gt;{{cite journal |author=Ibarrola N, Molina H, Iwahori A, Pandey A | year=2004 |title=A novel proteomic approach for specific identification of tyrosine kinase substrates using 13C tyrosine |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=279 |pages=15805–13 |pmid=14739304 |url=http://www.jbc.org/content/279/16/15805.long |doi=10.1074/jbc.M311714200 |issue=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; SILAC has emerged as a very powerful method to study [[cell signaling]], post translation modifications such as [[phosphorylation]],&lt;ref name= PM14739304 /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ibarrola N, Kalume DE, Gronborg M, Iwahori A, Pandey A | year=2003 |title=A Proteomic Approach for Quantitation of Phosphorylation Using Stable Isotope Labeling in Cell Culture |journal=Analytical Chemistry |volume=75 |pages=6043–49 |pmid=14615979 |url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac034931f |doi=10.1021/ac034931f |issue=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[protein-protein interaction]] and [[regulation of gene expression]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Simulated Fluorescence Process''' (SFP) is a computing algorithm used for scientific  visualization of 3D data from, for example, fluorescence microscopes. By modeling a physical light/matter interaction process an image is computed showing the data as it would have appeared in reality when viewed under these conditions.

==Principle==

The algorithm considers a virtual light source producing excitation light that illuminates the object. This casts shadows either on parts of the object itself or on other objects below it. The interaction between the excitation light and the object provokes the emission light, that also interacts with the object before it finally reaches the eye of the viewer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Scottish Instrumentation and Research Centre for Advanced Mass Spectrometry (SIRCAMS)''' is a facility for ultra-high resolution [[mass spectrometry]] of biomolecules, based at the University of Edinburgh.

SIRCAMS is part of the RCUK Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration in Proteomic Technologies (RASOR; Radical Solutions for Researching the Proteome)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gla.ac.uk/rasor/ University of Glasgow :: Biomedical &amp; Life Sciences :: RASOR]&lt;/ref&gt;, a consortium of the Universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee. Much of its research activity is focused toward the development and application of mass spectrometry for the analysis of intact peptides, proteins, protein-protein and protein-RNA/DNA complexes. Recent studies have included: identification of platination sites in peptides (bombesin, substance P, angiotensin, bradykinin) using IRMPD, CID and ECD, accurate mass measurements on intact proteins (YdaE 6.5kDa, ubiquitin 8.6kDa, trypsinogen 24kDa, carbonic anhydrase 28kDa, beSOD 31kDa, FbpA 33kDa, BSA 66kDa) under native and denaturing conditions, identification of dynamic post-translational modifications in intact human histones using top-down ECD, top-down identification of proteins from complex mixtures, as well as accurate mass analysis of oligonucleotide DNA strands (40 bp).

The capital cost of FTICR instruments operating at field strengths higher than 9.4 T are such that few University institutions world-wide can offer access. SIRCAMS offers user access to both the APEX III 9.4T and APEX Qe 12T FTICR mass spectrometers within the facility. By taking advantage of the research expertise that has been developed by staff within the facility, users have access to techniques for accurate mass measurement of intact proteins with isotope peak fitting, top-down protein sequencing from complex mixtures (such as biomarker identification) solution and gas-phase HDX for protein conformational studies, mapping of post-translational modifications in peptides and proteins, and identification of DNA modifications.

'''Site-directed spin labeling''' is a technique for investigating [[protein]] local dynamics using [[electron spin resonance]]. The theory of SDSL is based on the specific reaction of [[spin label]]s with [[amino acid]]s. A spin label's built-in protein structure can be detected by [[Electron spin resonance|EPR]] spectrometry.

SDSL is also a useful tool in examinations of protein folding process.

==Spin labeling==
Site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) was pioneered in the laboratory of [[Dr. W.L. Hubbell]].  In SDSL, sites for attachment of spin labels are introduced into recombinantly expressed proteins by site-directed mutagenesis.  Functional groups contained within the spin label determine their specificity.  At neutral pH, protein thiol groups specifically react with the functional groups methanethiosulfonate, maleimide, and iodoacetamide, creating a covalent bond with the amino acid [[cysteine|Cys]].  
Spin labels are a unique molecular reporter, in that they are paramagnetic (contain an unpaired electron).  Spin labels were first synthesized in the laboratory of [[H. M. McConnell]] in 1965.  Since then, a variety of nitroxide [[spin label]]s have enjoyed widespread use for the study of macromolecular structure and dynamics because of their stability and simple [[Electron spin resonance|EPR]] signal. 
The nitroxyl radical (N-O) is usually incorporated into a heterocyclic ring (e.g. [[pyrrolidine]]), and the unpaired electron is predominantly localized to the N-O bond.  Once incorporated into the protein, a spin label's motions are dictated by its local environment.  Because spin labels are exquisitely sensitive to motion, this has profound effects on its EPR spectrum.

[[Image:900 magnet new.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Solid-state 900 MHz (21.1 T&lt;ref&gt;http://nmr900.ca/instrument_e.html&lt;/ref&gt;) NMR spectrometer at the Canadian National Ultrahigh-field NMR Facility for Solids.]]'''Solid-state NMR''' ('''SSNMR''') spectroscopy is a kind of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) spectroscopy, characterized by the presence of anisotropic (directionally dependent) interactions.

==Introduction==
'''Basic concepts'''
A spin interacts with a [[magnetic field|magnetic]] or an [[electric field]]. Spatial proximity and/or a [[chemical bond]] between two [[atom]]s can give rise to interactions between nuclei. In general, these interactions are orientation dependent. In media with no or little mobility (e.g. crystals, powders, large membrane vesicles, molecular aggregates), anisotropic interactions have a substantial influence on the behaviour of a system of nuclear spins. In contrast, in a classical liquid-state NMR experiment, [[Brownian motion]] leads to an averaging of anisotropic interactions. In such cases, these interactions can be neglected on the time-scale of the NMR experiment.

'''Examples of anisotropic nuclear interactions'''
Two directionally dependent interactions commonly found in solid-state NMR are the ''chemical shift anisotropy'' (CSA) and the internuclear ''dipolar coupling''. Many more such interactions exist, such as the anisotropic [[J-coupling]] in NMR, or in related fields, such as the ''g''-tensor in [[electron spin resonance]]. In mathematical terms, all these interactions can be described using the same formalism.

'''Experimental background''' Anisotropic interactions modify the nuclear [[spin (physics)|spin]] energy levels (and hence the resonance frequency) of all sites in a molecule, and often contribute to a line-broadening effect in NMR spectra. However, there is a range of situations when their presence can either not be avoided, or is even particularly desired, as they encode structural parameters, such as orientation information, on the molecule of interest.

[[Image:Bruker MAS rotors.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Bruker zirconia MAS rotors (left to right), 7 mm diameter for MAS up to 8 kHz, 4 mm for 18 kHz, 3.2 mm for 23 kHz, 2.5 mm for 35 kHz, 1.3 mm for 70 kHz.]] High-resolution conditions in solids (in a wider sense) can be established using [[magic angle spinning|magic angle spinning (MAS)]], macroscopic sample orientation, combinations of both of these techniques, enhancement of mobility by highly viscous sample conditions, and a variety of [[radio frequency]] (RF) irradiation patterns. While the latter allows decoupling of interactions in spin space, the others facilitate averaging of interactions in real space. In addition, line-broadening effects from microscopic inhomogeneities can be reduced by appropriate methods of sample preparation.

Under decoupling conditions, isotropic interactions can report on the local structure, e.g. by the isotropic chemical shift. In addition, decoupled interactions can be selectively re-introduced (recoupling&quot;), and used, for example, for controlled de-phasing or transfer of polarization, which allows to derive a number of structural parameters.

'''Solid-state NMR line widths'''
The residual line width (full width at half max) of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C nuclei under MAS conditions at 5&amp;ndash;15&amp;nbsp;kHz spinning rate is typically in the order of 0.5&amp;ndash;2 ppm, and may be comparable to solution-state NMR conditions. Even at MAS rates of 20&amp;nbsp;kHz and above, however, non linear groups (not a straight line) of the same nuclei linked via the homonuclear dipolar interactions can only be suppressed partially, leading to line widths of 0.5 ppm and above, which is considerably more than in optimal [[solution state]] NMR conditions. Other interactions such as the quadrupolar interaction can lead to line widths of 1000's of ppm due to the strength of the interaction. The first-order quadrupolar broadening is largely suppressed by sufficiently fast MAS, but the second-order quadrupolar broadening has a different angular dependence and cannot be removed by spinning at one angle alone. Ways to achieve isotropic lineshapes for quadrupolar nuclei include spinning at two angles simultaneously (DOR), sequentially (DAS), or through refocusing the second-order quadrupolar interaction with a two-dimensional experiment such as MQMAS or STMAS.

'''Anisotropic interactions in solution-state NMR'''
From the perspective of solution-state NMR, it can be desirable to reduce motional averaging of dipolar interactions by alignment media. The order of magnitude of these [[residual dipolar coupling]]s (RDCs) are typically of only a few rad/Hz, but do not destroy high-resolution conditions, and provide a pool of information, in particular on the orientation of molecular domains with respect to each other.

'''Dipolar truncation'''
The dipolar coupling between two nuclei is inversely proportional to the cube of their distance. This has the effect that the polarization transfer mediated by the dipolar interaction is cut off in the presence of a third nucleus (all of the same kind, e.g. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) close to one of these nuclei. This effect is commonly referred to as dipolar truncation. It has been one of the major obstacles in efficient extraction of internuclear distances, which are crucial in the structural analysis of biomolecular structure. By means of labeling schemes or pulse sequences, however, it has become possible to circumvent this problem in a number of ways.

==Nuclear spin interactions in the solid phase==
&lt;!-- Magnitude of interaction... --&gt;

===Chemical shielding===
The chemical shielding is a local property of each nucleus, and depends on the external magnetic field.

Specifically, the external magnetic field induces currents of the electrons in molecular orbitals.  These induced currents create local magnetic fields that often vary across the entire molecular framework such that nuclei in distinct molecular environments usually experience unique local fields from this effect.  

Under sufficiently fast [[magic angle spinning]], or in solution-state NMR, the directionally dependent character of the [[chemical shielding]] is removed, leaving the isotropic [[chemical shift]].

===J-coupling===
The [[J-coupling]] or [[indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling]] (sometimes also called &quot;scalar&quot; coupling despite the fact that '''J''' is a tensor quantity) describes the interaction of nuclear spins through [[chemical bonds]].

===Dipolar coupling===
''Main article:'' [[Magnetic dipole-dipole interaction|Dipolar coupling (NMR)]]
[[Image:SSNMR dip coupl vect.png|thumb|Dipolar coupling vectors|150px|right|Dipolar coupling vectors]]
Nuclear spins exhibit a [[Nuclear magnetic moment|dipole moment]], which interacts with the dipole moment of other nuclei ([[dipolar coupling]]). The magnitude of the interaction is dependent on the spin species, the internuclear distance, and the orientation of the vector connecting the two nuclear spins with respect to the external magnetic field ''B'' (see figure). The maximum dipolar coupling is given by the dipolar coupling constant ''d'',
: &lt;math&gt; d = \frac{\hbar \mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{\gamma_1 \gamma_2}{r^3} &lt;/math&gt;,
where r is the distance between the nuclei, and γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[gyromagnetic ratio]]s of the nuclei. In a strong magnetic field, the dipolar coupling depends on the orientation of the internuclear vector with the external magnetic field by
: &lt;math&gt;D \propto 3\cos^2\theta - 1&lt;/math&gt;.
Consequently, two nuclei with a dipolar coupling vector at an angle of θ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;=54.7° to a strong external magnetic field, which is the angle where D becomes zero, have zero dipolar coupling. θ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is called the [[magic angle]]. One technique for removing dipolar couplings, at least to some extent, is [[magic angle spinning]].

===Quadrupolar interaction===
Nuclei with a spin greater than one-half have a non spherical charge distribution.  This is known as a quadrupolar nucleus.  A non spherical charge distribution can interact with an electric field gradient caused by some form of non-symmetry (e.g. in a trigonal bonding atom there are electrons around it in a plane, but not above or below it) to produce a change in the energy level in addition to the [[Zeeman effect]].  The quadrupolar interaction is the largest interaction in NMR apart from the Zeeman interaction and they can even become comparable in size.
Due to the interaction being so large it can not be treated to just the first order, like most of the other interactions.  This means you have a first and second order interaction, which can be treated separately.  The first order interaction has an angular dependency with respect to the magnetic field of &lt;math&gt;(3\cos^2\theta - 1)&lt;/math&gt; (the P2 [[Legendre polynomial]]), this means that if you spin the sample at &lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; (~54.74°) you can average out the first order interaction over one rotor period (all other interactions apart from Zeeman, Chemical shift, paramagnetic and J coupling also have this angular dependency).  However, the second order interaction depends on the P4 Legendre polynomial which has zero points at 30.6° and 70.1°.  These can be taken advantage of by either using DOR (DOuble angle Rotation) where you spin at two angles at the same time, or DAS (Double Angle Spinning) where you switch quickly between the two angles. But these techniques suffer from the fact that they require special hardware (probe). A revolutionary advance is Lucio Frydman's multiple quantum magic angle spinning (MQMAS) NMR in 1995 and it has become a routine method for obtaining high resolution solid-state NMR spectra of quadrupolar nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;Isotropic Spectra of Half-Integer Quadrupolar Spins from Bidimensional Magic-Angle Spinning NMR, Lucio Frydman and John S. Hardwood, ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'', '''1995''', ''117'', 5367—5368, (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Two-dimensional Magic-Angle Spinning Isotropic Reconstruction Sequences for Quadrupolar Nuclei , D. Massiot, B. Touzo, D. Trumeau, J. P. Coutures, J. Virlet, P. Florian and P. J. Grandinetti , ''Solid-State NMR'' , '''6''', 73 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; A similar method to MQMAS is satellite transisition magic angle spinning (STMAS) NMR proposed by Zhehong Gan in 2000.

''History of discoveries of NMR phenomena, and the development of solid-state NMR spectroscopy:''

Purcell, Torrey and Pound: &quot;nuclear induction&quot; on &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H in paraffin 1945, at about the same time Bloch ''et al.'' on &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H in water.

==Modern solid-state NMR spectroscopy==
''Methods and techniques''

===Basic example===
[[Image:Cross-polarization.png|thumb|Cross-polarization pulse sequence|200px|right|CP pulse sequence]]
A fundamental RF pulse sequence and building-block in most solid-state NMR experiments is cross-polarization (CP) [Waugh ''et al.'']. It can be used to enhance the signal of nuclei with a low gyromagnetic ratio (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N) by magnetization transfer from nuclei with a high gyromagnetic ratio (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H), or as spectral editing method (e.g. directed &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N→&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C CP in protein spectroscopy). In order to establish magnetization transfer, the RF pulses applied on the two frequency channels must fulfill the Hartmann&amp;ndash;Hahn condition [Hartmann, 1962]. Under MAS, this condition defines a relationship between the voltage through the RF coil and the rate of sample rotation. Experimental optimization of such conditions is one of the routine tasks in performing a (solid-state) NMR experiment.

CP is a basic building block of most pulse sequences in solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Given its importance, a pulse sequence employing direct excitation of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H spin polarization, followed by CP transfer to and signal detection of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N) or similar nuclei, is itself often referred to as ''CP experiment'', or, in conjunction with MAS, as ''CP-MAS'' [Schaefer and Stejskal, 1976]. It is the typical starting point of an investigation using solid-state NMR spectroscopy.

===Decoupling===
Nuclear spin interactions need to be removed ([[Nuclear magnetic resonance decoupling|decoupled]]) in order to increase the resolution of NMR spectra, and to isolate spin systems.

A technique that can substantially reduce or remove the chemical shift anisotropy, the dipolar coupling is ''sample rotation'' (most commonly [[magic angle spinning]], but also off-magic angle spinning).

''Homonuclear RF decoupling''  decouples spin interactions of nuclei which are the same as those which are being detected.  ''Heteronuclear RF decoupling'' decouples spin interactions of other nuclei.

===Recoupling===

Although the broadened lines are often not desired, dipolar couplings between atoms in the crystal lattice can also provide very useful information.  Dipolar coupling are distance dependent, and so they may be used to calculate interatomic distances in isotopically labeled molecules.

Because most dipolar interactions are removed by sample spinning, recoupling experiments are needed to re-introduce desired dipolar couplings so they can be measured.

An example of a recoupling experiment is the Rotational Echo DOuble Resonance (REDOR) experiment [Gullion and Schaefer, 1989].

==Applications==
===Biology===
[[Membrane protein]]s and [[amyloid]] fibrils, the latter related to [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], are two examples of application where solid-state NMR spectroscopy complements [[Protein NMR|solution-state NMR spectroscopy]] and beam diffraction methods (e.g. X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy).

===Chemistry===
Solid-state NMR spectroscopy serves as an analysis tool in organic and inorganic chemistry. SSNMR is also a valuable tool to study local dynamics, kinetics, and thermodynamics of a variety of systems.

'''Space charge''' is a concept in which excess [[electric charge]] is treated as a [[continuum]] of charge distributed over a region of space (either a volume or an area) rather than distinct point-like charges. This model typically applies when [[charge carriers]] have been emitted from some region of a solid—the cloud of emitted carriers can form a space charge region if they are sufficiently spread out, or the charged atoms or molecules left behind in the solid can form a space charge region. Space charge usually only occurs in [[dielectric]] media (including [[vacuum]]) because in a conductive medium the charge tends to be rapidly neutralized or [[Electric field screening|screened]]. The sign of the space charge can be either negative or positive. This situation is perhaps most familiar in the area near a [[metal]] object when it is heated to [[incandescence]] in a [[vacuum]]. This effect was first observed by [[Thomas Edison]] in light bulb [[Electrical filament|filament]]s, where it is sometimes called the [[Edison Effect]], but space charge is a significant phenomenon in many vacuum and [[solid-state electronic]] devices.

==Cause==
===Physical explanation===
When a metal object is placed in a vacuum and is heated to incandescence, the energy is sufficient to cause [[electron]]s to &quot;boil&quot; away from the surface [[atom]]s and surround the metal object in a cloud of [[free electron]]s. This is called [[thermionic emission]]. The resulting cloud is negatively charged, and can be attracted to any nearby positively charged object, thus producing an electrical current which passes through the vacuum.

Space charge can result from a range of phenomena, but the most important are:

# Combination of the current density and spatially inhomogeneous resistivity
# Ionization of species within the dielectric to form heterocharge
# Charge injection from electrodes and from a stress enhancemement
# Polarization in structures such as [[water tree]]s

It has been suggested that in [[alternating current|AC]] most of carriers injected at electrodes during a half of cycle 
are ejected during the next half cycle, so the net balance of charge on a cycle is practically 
zero. However, a small fraction of the carriers  can be trapped at levels deep enough to 
retain them when the field is inverted. The amount of charge in AC should increase slower 
than in [[direct current|DC]] and become observable after longer periods of time.

==== Hetero and Homo Charge ====
Hetero charge means that the polarity of the space charge is 
opposite to that of neighboring electrode, and homo charge is the reverse situation.  
Under high voltage application, a hetero charge near the electrode is expected to reduce the 
breakdown voltage, whereas a homo charge will increase it. After polarity reversal under ac 
conditions, the homo charge is converted to hetero space charge.

===Mathematical explanation===
If the &quot;[[vacuum]]&quot; has a [[pressure]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; mmHg or less, the main [[vehicle]] of conduction is [[electron]]s. The emission current density ''(J'') from the [[cathode]], as a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of its thermodynamic [[temperature]] ''T'', in the absence of space-charge, is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;J = (1-\tilde{r})A_0T^2\exp\left(\frac{-\phi}{kT}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{4\pi emk^2}{h^3} \approx &lt;/math&gt; 1.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; A m&lt;sup&gt;-2 &lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:''e'' = elementary positive charge (i.e., magnitude of electron charge),&lt;br&gt;
:''m'' = electron mass,&lt;br&gt;
:''k'' = [[Boltzmann's constant]] = 1.38 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-23&lt;/sup&gt;J/K,&lt;br&gt;  
:''h'' = [[Planck's constant]] = 6.55 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-34&lt;/sup&gt; J s,&lt;br&gt;
:''&amp;phi;'' = [[work function]] of the cathode, &lt;br&gt;
:''ř'' = mean electron reflection coefficient.

The reflection coefficient can be as low as 0.105 but is usually near 0.5. For [[Tungsten]], (1 - ř)A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.6 to 1.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; A m&lt;sup&gt;-2 &lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''&amp;phi;'' = 4.52 eV. At 2500 °C, the emission is 3000 A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The emission current as given above is many times greater than that normally collected by the electrodes, except in some [[pulse]]d [[valves]] such as the [[cavity magnetron]]. Most of the electrons emitted by the cathode are driven back to it by the [[repulsion]] of the [[cloud]] of electrons in its neighborhood. This is called the ''space charge effect''. In the limit of large current densities, ''J'' is given by the Child-Langmuir equation below, rather than by the thermionic emission equation above.

==Occurrence==
Space charge is an inherent property of all [[vacuum tube]]s. This has at times made life harder or easier for [[electrical engineer]]s who used tubes in their designs. For example, space charge significantly limited the practical application of [[triode]] [[amplifier]]s which lead to further innovations such as the vacuum tube [[tetrode]].

On the other hand, space charge was useful in some tube applications because it generates a negative [[Electromotive force|EMF]] within the tube's envelope, which could be used to create a negative bias on the tube's grid. Grid bias could also be achieved by using an applied grid voltage in addition to the control voltage. This could improve the engineer's control and fidelity of amplification.

Space charges can also occur within [[dielectric|dielectrics]]. For example, when gas near a high voltage electrode begins to undergo [[dielectric breakdown]], electrical charges are injected into the region near the electrode, forming space charge regions in the surrounding gas. Space charges can also occur within solid or liquid dielectrics that are stressed by high [[electric fields]]. Trapped space charges within solid dielectrics are often a contributing factor leading to dielectric failure within high voltage power cables and capacitors.

== Child's Law ==
[[Image:ChildLangmuirLawGraph1.png|Graph showing Child-Langmuir Law. S and d are constant and equal to 1.|thumb]]

Also known as the Child-Langmuir Law or the Three-Halves Power Law, Child's Law states that the [[space charge-limited current]] (SCLC) in a plane-parallel diode varies directly as the three-halves power of the anode voltage &lt;math&gt;{V_a}&lt;/math&gt; and inversely as the square of the distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; separating the cathode and the anode.  That is,

:&lt;math&gt;I_a=JS=2.33\times10^{-6}\frac{S\nu{V_a}^{3/2}}{d^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Where &lt;math&gt;I_a&lt;/math&gt; is the anode current, &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; the current density, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; the area.  This assumes the following:
# The electrodes are planar, parallel, equipotential surfaces of infinite dimensions.
# The electrons have zero velocity at the cathode surface.
# In the interelectrode region, only electrons are present.
# The current is space-charge limited.
# The anode voltage remains constant for a sufficiently long time so that the anode current is steady.

== Mott's steady-state space-charge-limited conduction model ==
The steady-state space-charge-limited conduction-current density &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; in a plane-parallel dielectric sample with electrode separation &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the square of the applied voltage &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.  That is,

:&lt;math&gt;J=\frac{9{\epsilon}{\mu}{V}^{2}}{8{L}^3}&lt;/math&gt;

This assumes the following:
# There is only one type of charge carrier present.
# The material has no intrinsic conductivity, but charges are injected into it from one electrode and captured by the other.
# The carrier mobility &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and the dielectric permittivity &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; are constant throughout the sample.
# The electric field at the charge-injecting cathode is zero.

As example of application, the steady state space charge limited current across silicon with charge carrier mobility = 1500 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/V-s, dielectric constant=11.9 and plate area=10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, space=10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt;cm can be calculated by [http://www.popproperty.net/PopularTools/Semiconductor/SpaceChargeLimited.aspx on line calcaulator] as 1.264&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt;A at voltage 3V.

== Shot noise ==
Space charge tends to reduce [[shot noise]].  Electrons (and positive [[electric charge|charge]] carriers) come with their own built-in negative [[feedback]].

[[Image:Spectral lines continuous.png|thumb|Continuous spectrum]]
[[Image:Spectral lines emission.png|thumb|Emission lines]]
[[Image:Spectral lines absorption.png|thumb|Absorption lines]]
A '''spectral line''' is a dark or bright line in an otherwise uniform and continuous [[optical spectrum|spectrum]], resulting from an excess or deficiency of photons in a narrow frequency range, compared with the nearby frequencies.

== Types of line spectra ==

Spectral lines are the result on interaction between a [[quantum system]] (usually [[atomic spectral line|atoms]], but sometimes [[molecule]]s or [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]]) and a single [[photon]]. When a photon has about the right amount of energy to allow a change in the energy state of the system (in the case of an atom this is usually an [[electron]] changing [[Electron configuration|orbitals]]), the photon is absorbed. Then it will be slowly re-emitted, either in the same slow frequency as the original or in a fast cascade, where the sum of the energies of the photons emitted will be very different from the energy of the one absorbed. The direction of the new photons will be related to the direction of travel of the original photon.

Depending on the type of gas, the photon source and what reaches the detector of the instrument, either an '''emission line''' or an '''absorption line''' will be produced. If the gas is between the photon source and the detector, a decrease in the intensity of light in the frequency of the incident photon will be seen, as the reemitted photons will mostly be in directions different from the original one. This will be an ''absorption line''. If the detector sees the gas, but not the original photon source, then the detector will see the photons reemitted in a narrow frequency range. This will be an ''emission line''.

Spectral lines are highly atom-specific, and can be used to identify the chemical composition of any medium capable of letting light pass through it (typically [[gas]] is used). Several elements were discovered by spectroscopic means, such as [[helium]], [[thallium]], and [[cerium]]. Spectral lines also depend on the physical conditions of the gas, so they are widely used to determine the chemical composition of [[star]]s and other celestial bodies that cannot be analyzed by other means, as well as their physical conditions.

Isomer shift is the displacement of an absorption line due to the absorbing nuclei having different s-electron densities from that of the emitting nuclei.

Mechanisms other than atom-photon interaction can produce spectral lines. Depending on the exact physical interaction (with molecules, single particles, etc.) the frequency of the involved photons will vary widely, and lines can be observed across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], from [[radio wave]]s to [[gamma ray]]s.

== Nomenclature ==
Spectral lines often have a unique [[Fraunhofer line]] designation, such as '''K''' for a line at 410.175 [[metre|nm]] emerging from singly ionized [[Calcium|Ca]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. In other cases the lines are designed according to the level of [[ion]]ization adding a [[Roman numerals|roman number]] to the designation of the [[chemical element]], so that Ca&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; also have the designation '''CaII'''. Neutral atoms are denoted with the roman number I, singly ionized atoms with II, and so on, so that for example FeIX represents eight times (IX, roman 9) ionized [[iron]].

== Spectral line broadening and shift ==

A spectral line extends over a range of frequencies, not a single frequency (i.e., it has a nonzero [[spectral linewidth|linewidth]]). In addition, its center may be shifted from its nominal central wavelength. There are several reasons for this broadening and shift. These reasons may be divided into two broad categories - broadening due to local conditions and broadening due to extended conditions. Broadening due to local conditions is due to effects which hold in a small region around the emitting element, usually small enough to assure [[local thermodynamic equilibrium]]. Broadening due to extended conditions may result from changes to the spectral distribution of the radiation as it traverses its path to the observer. It also may result from the combining of radiation from a number of regions which are far from each other.

=== Broadening due to local effects ===

*'''Natural broadening''':  The [[Uncertainty principle|uncertainty principle]] relates the lifetime of an excited state (due to the [[Spontaneous emission|spontaneous radiative decay]] or the [[Auger effect|Auger process]]) with the uncertainty of its energy. This broadening effect results in an unshifted [[Lorentzian function|Lorentzian profile]]. The natural broadening can be experimentally altered only to the extent Hi mark guess who? that decay rates can be artificially suppressed or enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the following article, decay was suppressed via a microwave cavity, thus reducing the natural broadening: {{cite journal|last=Gabrielse|first =Gerald|coauthors=H. Dehmelt|title=Observation of Inhibited Spontaneous Emission|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=55|pages=67–70|date=1985|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Thermal [[Doppler broadening]]''': The atoms in a gas which are emitting radiation will have a distribution of velocities. Each photon emitted will be &quot;red&quot;- or &quot;blue&quot;-shifted by the [[Doppler effect]] depending on the velocity of the atom relative to the observer. The higher the temperature of the gas, the wider the distribution of velocities in the gas. Since the spectral line is a combination of all of the emitted radiation, the higher the temperature of the gas, the broader will be the spectral line emitted from that gas. This broadening effect is described by a [[Gaussian function|Gaussian profile]] and there is no associated shift.

*'''Pressure broadening''': the presence of nearby particles will affect the radiation emitted by an individual particle. There are two limiting cases by which this occurs:
:*'''Impact pressure broadening''': The collision of other particles with the emitting particle interrupts the emission process. The duration of the collision is much shorter than the lifetime of the emission process. This effect depends on both the [[density]] and the [[temperature]] of the gas. The broadening effect is described by a [[Lorentzian function|Lorentzian profile]] and there may be an associated shift.
:*'''Quasistatic pressure broadening''': The presence of other particles shifts the energy levels in the emitting particle, thereby altering the frequency of the emitted radiation. The duration of the influence is much longer than the lifetime of the emission process. This effect depends on the [[density]] of the gas, but is rather insensitive to [[temperature]]. The form of the line profile is determined by the functional form of the perturbing force with respect to distance from the perturbing particle. There may also be a shift in the line center.
:Pressure broadening may also be classified by the nature of the perturbing force as follows:
:*'''Linear Stark broadening''' occurs via the [[linear Stark effect]] which results from the interaction of an emitter with an electric field, which causes a shift in energy which is linear in the field strength. (&lt;math&gt;\Delta E \sim 1/r^2&lt;/math&gt;)
:*'''Resonance broadening''' occurs when the perturbing particle is of the same type as the emitting particle, which introduces the possibility of an energy exchange process. (&lt;math&gt;\Delta E \sim 1/r^3&lt;/math&gt;)
:*'''Quadratic Stark broadening''' occurs via the [[quadratic Stark effect]] which results from the interaction of an emitter with an electric field, which causes a shift in energy which is quadratic in the field strength. (&lt;math&gt;\Delta E \sim 1/r^4&lt;/math&gt;)
:*'''Van der Waals broadening''' occurs when the emitting particle is being perturbed by [[Van der Waals force]]s. For the quasistatic  case, a [[Levy distribution|Van der Waals profile]] is often useful in describing the profile. The energy shift as a function of distance is given in the wings by e.g. the [[Lennard-Jones potential]] (&lt;math&gt;\Delta E \sim 1/r^6&lt;/math&gt;)

=== Broadening due to non-local effects ===

Certain types of broadening are the result of conditions over a large region of space rather than simply upon conditions that are local to the emitting particle.

*'''Opacity broadening''': Electromagnetic radiation emitted at a particular point in space can be absorbed as it travels through space. This absorption depends on wavelength. The line is broadened because photons at the line wings have a smaller reabsorption probability than photons at the line center. Indeed, the absorption near line center may be so great as to cause a '''self reversal''' in  which the intensity at the center of the line is less than in the wings. 

*'''Macroscopic [[Doppler broadening]]''': Radiation emitted by a moving source is a subject to the [[Doppler shift]] due to a finite line-of-sight velocity projection. If different parts of the emitting body have different velocities (along the line of sight), the resulting line will be broadened, with the line width proportional to the width of the velocity distribution. For example, radiation emitted from a distant rotating body, such as a [[star]], will be broadened due to the line-of-sight variations in velocity on opposite sides of the star. The greater the rate of rotation, the broader the line. Another example is an imploding [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] shell in a [[Z-pinch]].

=== Combined effects ===

Each of these mechanisms can act in isolation or in combination with others. Assuming each effect is independent, the observed line profile is a convolution of the line profiles of each mechanism. For example, a combination of the thermal Doppler broadening and the impact pressure broadening yields a [[Voigt profile]].

However, the different line broadening mechanisms are not always independent. For example, the collisional effects and the motional Doppler shifts can act in a coherent manner, resulting under some conditions even in a collisional ''narrowing'', known as the [[Dicke effect]].

[[Image:Spektrofotometri.jpg|thumb|300px|Spectrophotometer]]
In [[chemistry]], '''spectrophotometry''' is the quantifiable study of [[electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic spectra]]. It is more specific than the general term [[electromagnetic spectroscopy]] in that spectrophotometry deals with [[Visible spectrum|visible]] light, near-[[ultraviolet]], and near-[[infrared]].   Also, the term does not cover [[time-resolved spectroscopy|time-resolved spectroscopic]] techniques.

Spectrophotometry involves the use of a spectrophotometer. A spectrophotometer is a [[photometer]] (a device for measuring light intensity) that can measure intensity as a function of the light source wavelength. Important features of spectrophotometers are spectral bandwidth and linear range of absorption measurement.

Perhaps the most common application of spectrophotometers is the measurement of light absorption, but they can be designed to measure diffuse or specular [[reflectance]].{{Clarify me|date=May 2009}} Strictly, even the emission half of a luminescence instrument is a type of spectrophotometer.

The use of spectrophotometers spans various scientific fields, such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], and [[molecular biology]].&lt;ref name=george&gt;Rendina, George. ''Experimental Methods in Modern Biochemistry'' W. B. Saunders Company: Philadelphia, PA. 1976. pp. 46-55&lt;/ref&gt; They are widely used in many industries including printing and forensic examination.

==Design==
[[File:Spetrophotometer-en.svg|thumb|330px|Single beam spectrophotometer]]
There are two major classes of devices: single beam and double beam. A double beam spectrophotometer compares the light intensity between two light paths, one path containing a reference sample and the other the test sample. A single beam spectrophotometer measures the relative light intensity of the beam before and after a test sample is inserted. Although comparison measurements from double beam instruments are easier and more stable, single beam instruments can have a larger dynamic range and are optically simpler and more compact.

Historically, spectrophotometers use a [[monochromator]] containing a [[diffraction grating]] to produce the analytical spectrum. There are also spectrophotometers that use arrays of photosensors. Especially for infrared spectrophotometers, there are spectrophotometers that use a [[Fourier transform]] technique to acquire the spectral information quicker in a technique called [[Fourier Transform InfraRed]].

The spectrophotometer quantitatively compares the fraction of light that passes through a reference solution and a test solution. Light from the source lamp is passed through a monochromator, which diffracts the light into a &quot;rainbow&quot; of wavelengths and outputs narrow bandwidths of this diffracted spectrum. Discrete frequencies are transmitted through the test sample. Then the [[intensity]]{{dn}} of the transmitted light is measured with a [[photodiode]] or other [[photodetector|light sensor]], and the [[transmittance]] value for this wavelength is then compared with the transmission through a reference sample.

In short, the sequence of events in a spectrophotometer is as follows:
# The light source shines through a monochromator.
# An output wavelength is selected and beamed at the sample.
# A fraction of the monochromatic light is transmitted through the sample and to the photodetector.

Many spectrophotometers must be calibrated by a procedure known as &quot;zeroing.&quot; The absorbency of a reference substance is set as a baseline value, so the absorbencies of all other substances are recorded relative to the initial &quot;zeroed&quot; substance. The spectrophotometer then displays % absorbency (the amount of light absorbed relative to the initial substance).&lt;ref name=george/&gt;

== UV and IR spectrophotometers ==
The most common spectrophotometers are used in the [[UV]] and [[Visible spectrum|visible]] regions of the spectrum, and some of these instruments also operate into the near-[[infrared]] region as well. 

Visible region 400–700&amp;nbsp;nm spectrophotometry is used extensively in [[colorimetry]] science.
Ink manufacturers, printing companies, textiles vendors, and many more, need the data provided through colorimetry. They take readings in the region of every 10–20 nanometers along the visible region, and produce a [[spectral reflectance]] curve or a data stream for alternative presentations. These curves can be used to test a new batch of colorant to check if it makes a match to specifications e.g., iso printing standards. 

Traditional visual region spectrophotometers cannot detect if a colorant or the base material has fluorescence. This can make it difficult to manage color issues if for example one or more of the printing inks is fluorescent. Where a colorant contains fluorescence, a [[bi-spectral fluorescent spectrophotometer]] is used. There are two major setups for visual spectrum spectrophotometers, d/8 (spherical) and 0/45.  The names are due to the geometry of the light source, observer and interior of the measurement chamber.
Scientists use this instrument to measure the amount of compounds in a sample. If the compound is more concentrated more light will be absorbed by the sample; within small ranges, the [[Beer-Lambert law]] holds and the absorbance between samples vary with concentration linearly.
In the case of printing measurements two alternative settings are commonly used- without/with uv filter to control better the effect of uv brighteners within the paper stock.

Samples are usually prepared in [[cuvette]]s; depending on the region of interest, they may be constructed of [[glass]], [[plastic]], or [[quartz glass|quartz]].

==IR spectrophotometry==
Spectrophotometers designed for the main infrared region are quite different because of the technical requirements of measurement in that region. One major factor is the type of photosensors that are available for different spectral regions, but infrared measurement is also challenging because virtually everything emits IR light as thermal radiation, especially at wavelengths beyond about 5&amp;nbsp;μm.

Another complication is that quite a few materials  such as glass and plastic absorb infrared light, making it incompatible as an optical medium. Ideal optical materials are [[salts]], which do not absorb strongly. Samples for IR spectrophotometry may be smeared between two discs of [[potassium bromide]] or ground with potassium bromide and pressed into a pellet. Where aqueous solutions are to be measured, insoluble [[silver chloride]] is used to construct the cell.

== Spectroradiometers ==
[[Spectroradiometer]]s, which operate almost like the visible region spectrophotometers, are designed to measure the [[spectral density]] of illuminants in order to evaluate and categorize lighting for sales by the manufacturer, or for the customers to confirm the lamp they decided to purchase is within their specifications. Components: 

# The light source shines onto or through the sample. 
# The sample transmits or reflects light. 
# The detector detects how much light was reflected from or transmitted through the sample. 
# The detector then converts how much light the sample transmitted or reflected into a number.

[[Image:Spinecho.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Spin echo: [[Pulse sequence]] (above) and Signal (below)]]
In [[nuclear magnetic resonance]], '''spin echo''' refers to the refocusing of [[Precession|precessing]] nuclear spin magnetisation by a ''180° pulse'' of resonant radiofrequency.

The [[Free induction decay|NMR signal]] observed following an initial excitation pulse (orange in diagram) decays with time due to both spin-spin [[Relaxation (NMR)|relaxation]] and any ''inhomogeneous'' effects which cause different spins to precess at different rates e.g. a distribution of [[chemical shift]]s or [[Pulsed field gradient|magnetic field gradients]].  Relaxation leads to an irreversible loss of magnetisation ([[decoherence]]), but the inhomogeneous dephasing can be reversed by applying a 180°  or ''inversion'' pulse (blue in diagram) that inverts the magnetisation vectors.  If the inversion pulse is applied after a period ''T'' of dephasing, the inhomogeneous evolution will rephase to form an ''echo'' at time 2''T''.  The intensity of the echo relative to the initial signal is given by &lt;math&gt;\exp(-2T/T_2)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; is the time constant for spin-spin relaxation.  

Another method for generating spin echoes is to apply three successive 90° pulses. After the first 90° pulse, the magnetization vector is exchanging energy through dipole, dipole interactions and in a time τ, forms what is often referred to as a “pancake” in the x’-y’ plane. A further 90° pulse is then applied such that our “pancake” is now in the x’-z’ plane. When considering the two types of relaxation, spin – lattice and spin – spin (T1 and T2) we assume the former to take an infinite amount of time as such allowing the spin vectors to precess about the z axis. Now, the angle each spin makes with the z’ axis is equal to the angle it previously made about the y’ axis. At this point any change in angle that now takes place will require a change in energy thus implying a spin – lattice interaction is necessary. This implies a permanent memory of the state of the system as it was at time τ. 
After a further time τ2 a third pulse is applied and our Magnetization vector is back in the x’ – y’ plane and will lie in the same direction as for a (90 – τ – 180) spin echo sequence formally discussed. Then after final delay of τ we see what is commonly referred to as a stimulated echo.
This technique is commonly used when studying T1 relaxation times. This is because by measuring the magnitude of the correct echo and its decay with pulse width separation we can determine T1. The echo magnitude will depend on the relation, exp(-τ2/T1). 

Echo phenomena are important features of coherent [[spectroscopy]] which have been observed and used in various fields from magnetic resonance to [[laser spectroscopy]].  They are fundamental to [[magnetic resonance imaging]].  Echoes were first detected in nuclear magnetic resonance by [[Erwin Hahn]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;E. L. Hahn, ''Physical Review'' '''80''', 580–594 (1950)&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==

The spin echo concept of Erwin Hahn was fully explained in his 1950 paper, but it was further developed by Carr who pointed out more aspects of a full 180 degree refocusing pulse.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, HY: Effects of diffusion on free precession in nuclear magnetic resonance, ''Physical Review'' '''94''', 630-638 (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carr, HY: Sharper images of MRI's origins. &quot;Physics Today&quot; &quot;46:93-36 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental concept may be better understood by considering the following symbolic representation:

[[Image:Spin Echo Diagram.jpg|600 px]]

The spin echo concept. (A) - The vertical green arrow is the average magnetic moment of a group of protons. All are vertical in the main field and spinning on their long axis. (B) A  90 degree pulse (orange arrow) has been applied that flips the arrow into the horizontal (x-y) plane. The black arrow shows the precession of the net magnetic moment.  (C) &amp; (D) Due to T2* effects, as the net moment precesses, some protons slow down due to lower local field strength (and so begin to progressively trail behind) while some speed up due to higher field strength and start getting ahead of the others. This makes the signal broaden progressively, dephasing and decaying. (E) A 180 degree pulse is now applied (orange arrow) so now the slower protons lead ahead of the main moment and the fast ones trail behind. (F) Progressively, the fast moments catch up with the main moment and the slow moments drift back toward the main moment. (G) Complete refocusing has occurred and at this time, an accurate T2 echo can be measured with all T2* effects removed. Quite separately, return of the green arrow towards the vertical (not shown) would reflect the T1 relaxation.

[[Image:Epr spectrum.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Electron paramagnetic resonance|EPR]] spectrum of a spin label]]
A '''spin label''' ('''SL''') is an [[organic molecule]] which possesses an unpaired [[electron]], usually on a [[nitrogen]] atom, and the ability to bind to another molecule. Spin labels are normally used as tools for probing [[protein]]s or [[biological membrane]]-local dynamics using [[Electron paramagnetic resonance|EPR]] spectroscopy. The [[site-directed spin labeling]] (SDSL) technique allows one to monitor a specific region within a protein. In protein structure examinations, [[amino acid]]-specific SLs can be used.

The goal of spin labeling is somewhat similar to that of isotopic substitution in [[NMR spectroscopy]].  There one replaces an atom lacking a nuclear spin (and so is NMR-silent) with an isotope having a spin I &lt;math&gt;\neq&lt;/math&gt; 0 (and so is NMR-active).  This technique is useful for tracking the chemical environment around an atom when full substitution with an NMR-active isotope is not feasible. Recently, spin-labelling has also been used to probe chemical local environment in NMR itself, in a technique known as [[Paramagnetic]] Relaxation Enhancement (PRE).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Spin trapping''' is an analytical technique employed in the detection and identification of short-lived free radicals. Spin trapping involves the addition of radical to a nitrone spin trap resulting in the formation of a spin adduct, a nitroxide-based persistent radical, that can be detected using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The spin adduct usually yields a distinctive EPR spectrum characteristic of a particular free radical that is trapped.  The identity of the radical can be inferred based from the EPR spectral profile of their respective spin adducts such as the ''g'' value, but most importantly, the hyperfine-coupling constants of relevant nuclei. Unambiguous assignments of the identity of the trapped radical can often be made by using stable isotope substitution of the radicals parent compound, so that further hyperfine couplings are introduced or altered. 

The most commonly used spin traps are alpha-phenyl N-tertiary-butyl nitrone (PBN) and 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO). More rarely, C-nitroso spin traps such as 3,5-Dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonic acid (DBNBS) can be used as spin traps: often additional hyperfine information is derived, but at a cost of specificity (due to facile non-radical addition of many compounds to C-nitroso species, and subsequent oxidation of the resulting hydroxylamine). 

5-Diisopropoxyphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DIPPMPO) spin trapping has been used in measuring superoxide production in mitochondria.

The use of radical-addition reactions to detect short-lived radicals was first proposed by E. G. Janzen in 1965.

It is worth noting that the radical adduct (or products such as the hydroxylamine) can often be stable enough to allow non-EPR detection techniques.  The groups of London, and Berliner &amp; Khrahmtsov have used  NMR to study such adducts and Timmins and co-workers used charge changes upon DBNBS trapping to isolate protein adducts for study. A major advance has been the development of anti-DMPO antibodies by Mason's group, allowing study of spin trapping reactions by a simple immuno-based techniques.

'''Static secondary ion mass spectrometry''', or '''static SIMS''' is a technique for chemical analysis including elemental composition and [[chemical structure]] of the uppermost atomic or molecular layer of a solid which may be a metal, semiconductor or plastic with insignificant disturbance to its composition and structure. It is one of the two principal modes of operation of [[Secondary ion mass spectrometry|SIMS]], which is the [[mass spectrometry]] of ionized particles emitted by a solid (or sometimes liquid) surface upon bombardment by energetic primary particles.

Most energy of the primary ions is dissipated into the near surface region of the solid by a series of binary collisions. This results in ejection (sputtering) of so-called ‘secondary’ particles such as electrons; neutral species, [[atom]]s, and molecules; atomic and cluster ions from the surface. In SIMS it is these secondary ions which are detected and analyzed by a mass spectrometer to produce a [[mass spectrum]] of a surface for a detailed chemical analysis of the surface or the solid [4].

All the secondary ions generated in SIMS analysis originate from the topmost monolayers of the bombarded solid. This means that all different modes of SIMS analysis are basically surface analyses secondary ion emission-atomic as well as molecular-reflect the chemical composition of the surface-near region of the bombarded solid. However, the intention of different SIMS analyses may be quite different. This depends on the erosion rate of the surface which is controlled by the dose of the primary ions. It may be bulk analysis (Dynamic SIMS) or a true analysis of originally uppermost monolayer of a condensed phase (Static SIMS). 

==Primary Operating Conditions==

Ion bombardment of a surface may result in a drastic change of its chemical composition and structure. These changes include sputtering, amorphization, implantation, diffusion, chemical reactions, and so on. All these changes are limited to a very small region surrounding the path of the primary ion into the solid. For Static SIMS each subsequent primary ion hits an undamaged area and total of only 0.1-1% of the atomic sites are bombarded during the measurement. To ensure this very low primary current densities are used generally in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; A/cm² (primary ion dose is below 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; ions/cm2).  This leads to extremely small sputtering rates of fraction of a monolayer per hour and hence small secondary ion current density. Additionally, these emitted secondary ions are of low kinetic energy and emitted up to 20&amp;nbsp;nm from the impact site with surface annealing occurring in [[femto]]-seconds. These reasons make SSIMS a purely surface analysis technique causing negligible damage to the surface and with detection limit as low as 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; monolayer (ML). 

[[Image:STATIC.SIMS.RICHA.3.GIF|thumb|right|300 px]]

==Spectrum==
The mass spectrum of the secondary ions emitted from the bombarded surface during SSIMS provides direct information of not only chemical composition but also of chemical structure of the bombarded area. This is because the mass spectrum includes cluster ions as well as elemental ions. These cluster ions reflect the surface chemistry in a detailed way. Figure shows the mass spectrum obtained from a SSIMS analysis of [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE). Positive ion spectrum shows positive atomic ion (i.e. C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and molecular ions (i.e. CF&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CF3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, C3F3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) of the target. Negative ion spectrum shows the atomic ion (i.e. F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) and molecular ions (i.e. F2&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, CF3&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, C3F3&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;).

[[Image:STATIC.SIMS.RICHA.4.GIF|thumb|right|300 px|Static SIMS spectra from the surface of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene)]]

==History of Static SIMS==
Static SIMS was introduced by Benninghoven at the [[University of Münster]] in 1969. He applied the technique of SIMS to study surfaces in [[Ultra high vacuum|UHV]] by deliberately using low primary ion currents covering large areas. 
Initially, most SSIMS was performed using [[Quadrupole mass analyzer]]. However, in mid-1980 it was realized that Time-of-Flight spectrometers is more efficient [2, 4] for this mode of SIMS.
Static SIMS and other Surface Techniques
Compared to other surface techniques, such as Auger and Photoelectron spectroscopy, SSIMS offers some unique features:
#Isotope sensitivity
#Hydrogen sensitivity
#Direct compound detection by molecular secondary ion emission and
#Extremely high sensitivity, very often in the ppm range.
However, one problem in static SIMS application may be quantification. This problem can be overcome by using a combination of electron spectroscopic techniques such as [[Auger electron spectroscopy]] (AES) and photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS or XPS) with Static SIMS [3].

==Application in Surface Science==
===Oxidation study of metals===
Investigation of the initial process of oxidation where only the first two or three metal layers participate in the oxidation.

===Metal surface characterization===
Gives a rigorous test of surface cleanliness as it can detect species in ppm concentration.

===Studies of Chemisorption===
Investigation of nature of adsorption (molecular or dissociative). For example dissociative adsorption of CO on metal surface (M) is characterized by MC&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, MO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, M2O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and M2C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; secondary ions (Fe and W). And molecular adsorption is identified by MCO+ and M2CO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions (Cu, Pd, Ni and Fe). Similarly, it also helps in investigation of binding energy, chemical structure of the adsorbate, interaction between adsorbate molecules and reactivity of adsorbate .&lt;ref&gt;Vickerman J.C., Brown A., Reed N.M. “Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy: Principles and Applications”, Oxford Science Publication, (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
===Vacuum systems===
SSIMS experiments are performed in high vacuum for two reasons: first, to avoid scattering of the primary and secondary beams: second, to prevent interfering adsorption of gases (i.e. oxygen) on the surface under investigation. For the first requirement a pressure lower than 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; mbar is sufficient to ensure a mean free path that is long compared with the beam path. One monolayer of gas forms in 1 second at a pressure of 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; mbar. Thus for SSIMS analyses a pressure of ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; mbar is needed to allow adequate time to complete the experiment [1]. 

===Mass spectrometer===
Quadrupole, Magnetic sector and Time-of-flight (TOF) are the three mass spectrometers (MS) used in SIMS. 
For SSIMS the primary requirement is low primary ion flux density which results in extremely low secondary ion yield (10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; atoms/cm³). Hence, there is a need to collect almost all the secondary ions. The Time of Flight (TOF) analyzer is the best suited and for this molecular application.  High transmission (0.5-1) of TOF maximizes the sensitivity (10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; times that of Quadrupole MS). Parallel detection together with reasonable mass resolution and high mass range (m/z&gt; 10³) are among its other major advantages.&lt;br /&gt; 
'''TOF-MS'''&lt;br /&gt;
Ions are accelerated to a given potential so that they have the same kinetic energy resulting in ions of different mass:charge (m/e) ratio to have different velocities. These ions then pass through a region of field free space in the flight tube, and spread out in time, with the higher mass ions arriving later at the end of the flight tube where a time-sensitive detection system produces a mass spectrum. The primary ions are pulsed into short bursts of &lt;10 ns (the time scale of secondary ion emission after impact is negligible (&lt;10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; s)). The primary beam is pulsed by a rapid deflection across a small aperture or by off-axis deflection, followed by a curved magnetic field to compress the pulse in space. There is very high accelerating fields at the sample (high extraction voltage and small (mm) extraction gaps) to reduce the initial energy spread of the secondary ions. Some TOF systems further compensate for this energy spread by using non-linear flight tubes. One such design has a curved electrostatic path so that the more energetic ions are forced round the outer part of the bend. Another such design incorporates an electrostatic mirror in which the more energetic ions penetrate more deeply before reflection. In both designs, the faster ions have a longer flight path to offset their increased velocity, and all ions of the same mass arrive at the detector simultaneously [1].

[[Image:STATIC.SIMS.RICHA.5.GIF|thumb|right|300 px|Basic principal of TOF SIMS]]

===Primary ion source===
One of the following three types of ion source is used for SSIMS: electron impact, surface ionization and liquid-metal ion sources.
In the electron impact ion source, electrons from a heated filament (cathode) are accelerated towards an anode by a voltage difference where they ionize supply gas atoms on impact. This source usually operates with [[noble gas]]es. Typically the energy is variable from 0.1-5keV allowing spot sizes from ~50μm to several millimeters.
 
Surface ionization sources use Cs+ as the primary beam sources for TOF SIMS. Evaporation of [[Caesium]] from a heated [[tungsten]] surface occurs both as atoms and ions. These ions are then accelerated away from the emitting surface. Since no collisions are involved the [[ion beam]] is very pure and since evaporation is by thermal means the energy spread is very small ~2kT (0.2eV).  The low energy spread and high intrinsic brightness of the ion sources offers the possibility of obtaining small spot sizes. 

Liquid-metal ion sources draw a liquid metal (usually [[Gallium]]) from a heated reservoir over a tip (radius ~5 μm) of a needle. Electrostatic field is produced at the tip by an extraction electrode biased negatively in front of the tip. Opposing electrostatic field and [[surface tension]] forces acting on the liquid film produce a conical shape with high radius of curvature cusp (~2 μm) protruding from the tip. From this cusp field ion emission occurs, by means of the process of field evaporation [1,5].

[[Image:Stokes_shift.png|right|thumb|400px|Stokes shift]]

'''Stokes shift''' is the difference (in [[wavelength]] or [[frequency]] units) between positions of the band maxima of the [[absorption (optics)|absorption]] and [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] ([[fluorescence]] and [[Raman_spectroscopy|Raman]] being two examples) of the same electronic transition. It is named after Irish physicist [[George Gabriel Stokes|George G. Stokes]].

When a system (be it a [[molecule]] or [[atom]]) absorbs a [[photon]], it gains energy and enters an excited state. One way for the system to relax is to emit a photon, thus losing its energy (another method would be the loss of [[heat]] energy). When the emitted photon has less energy than the absorbed photon, this energy difference is the Stokes shift.  If the emitted photon has more energy, the energy difference is called an anti-Stokes shift; this extra energy comes from dissipation of thermal phonons in a crystal lattice, cooling the crystal in the process. [[Yttrium oxysulfide]] doped with [[gadolinium oxysulfide]] is a common industrial anti-Stokes pigment, absorbing in the near-infrared and emitting in the visible portion of the spectrum.

==Stokes fluorescence==
Stokes fluorescence is the re-emission of longer wavelength photons (lower frequency or energy) by a molecule that has absorbed photons of shorter wavelengths (higher frequency or energy). Both absorption and radiation (emission) of energy are unique characteristics of a particular molecular structure. If a material has a direct bandgap in the range of visible light, the light shining on it is absorbed, causing electrons to become excited to a higher energy state. The electrons remain in the excited state for about 10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. This number varies over several orders of magnitude, depending on the sample and is known as the fluorescence lifetime of the sample. The electron returns to the ground state and energy is emitted.

'''Supercritical Angle Fluorescence Microscopy (SAF)''' is a technique to detect and characterize fluorescent species (proteins, biomolecules, pharmaceuticals, etc.) and their behaviour very close or even [[adsorption|adsorbed]] or linked at surfaces. The method is able to observe molecules in a distance of less than 100 to 0 nanometer from the surface even in presence of high concentrations of fluorescent species around. Using an aspheric lens for excitation of a sample with laser light, [[fluorescence]] emitted by the specimen is collected above the [[critical angle]] of [[total internal reflection]] selectively and directed by a parabolic optics onto a detector. The method was invented in 1998 in the laboratories of [[Stefan Seeger]] at [[University of Regensburg]]/Germany and later at [[University of Zurich]]/Switzerland.

== SAF Microscopy Principle ==
The principle how SAF Microscopy works is as follows: A fluorescent specimen does not emit fluorescence isotropically when it comes close to a surface, but approximately 70% of the fluorescence emitted is directed into the solid phase. Here, the main part enters the solid body above the critical angle&lt;ref&gt;J. Enderlein, T. Ruckstuhl, S. Seeger: Highly Efficient Optical Detection of Surface-Generated Fluorescence. Appl. Opt. 38 (4) 724-32 (1999)
&lt;/ref&gt;. When the emitter is located just 200&amp;nbsp;nm above the surface, fluorescent light entering the solid body above the critical angle is decreased dramatically. Hence, SAF Microscopy is ideally suited to discriminate between molecules and particles at or close to surfaces and all other specimen present in the bulk&lt;ref&gt;T. Ruckstuhl, M. Rankl, S. Seeger: Highly sensitive biosensing using a Supercritical Angle Fluorescence (SAF) instrument, Biosensors&amp;Bioelectronics 18 (9) 1193-1199 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;T. Ruckstuhl, S. Seeger: Attoliter detection volumes by confocal total-internal-reflection fluorescence microscopy, Optic Letters 29, 569-571 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Typical SAF-setup ==
The typical SAF setup consists of a laser line (typically 450-633&amp;nbsp;nm), which is reflected into the aspheric lens by a dichroic mirror. The lens focuses the laser beam in the sample, causing the particles to fluoresce. The fluorescent light then passes through a parabolic lens before reaching a detector, typically a [[photomultiplier]] tube or [[avalanche photodiode]] detector.

[[Image:Q-TOF.jpg|300 px|right|thumb|A [[Quadrupole mass analyzer|quadrupole]] [[time-of-flight mass spectrometry|time-of-flight]] hybrid tandem mass spectrometer.]]
'''Tandem mass spectrometry''', also known as '''MS/MS''', involves multiple steps of [[mass spectrometry]] selection, with some form of fragmentation occurring in between the stages.&lt;ref&gt;IUPAC gold book definition of ''tandem mass spectrometer'' [http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/T06250.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tandem MS instruments==
Multiple stages of mass analysis separation can be accomplished with individual mass spectrometer elements separated in space or in a single mass spectrometer with the MS steps separated in time. In tandem mass spectrometry in space, the separation elements are physically separated and distinct, although there is a connection between the elements to maintain [[high vacuum]]. These elements can be [[sector mass spectrometer|sectors]], [[Quadrupole mass analyzer|transmission quadrupole]], or [[time-of-flight]]. In a tandem mass spectrometry in time instrument, the separation is accomplished with ions trapped in  the same place, with multiple separation steps taking place over time. A [[quadrupole ion trap]] or [[Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance|FTMS]] instrument can be used for such an analysis. Trapping instruments can perform multiple steps of analysis, which is sometimes referred to as MS&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; (MS to the n). Often the number of steps, n, is not indicated, but occasionally the value is specified; for example MS&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; indicates three stages of separation.

==Notation==
 [[Image:MS MS.png|thumb|right|400 px|Schematic of tandem mass spectrometry]]
For tandem mass spectrometry in space, the different elements are often noted in shorthand. 

:'''Q''' - [[Quadrupole mass analyzer]] 
:'''q''' - [[Radio frequency]] collision quadrupole
:'''TOF''' - [[Time-of-flight]] mass analyzer
:'''B''' - Magnetic [[sector mass spectrometer|sector]] 
:'''E''' - Electric sector.

The notation can be combined to indicate various hybrid instrument, for example

:'''QqQ''' - Triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
:'''QTOF''' - Quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (also QqTOF)
:'''BEBE''' - Four-sector (reverse geometry) mass spectrometer.

==Tandem MS experiments==
There are a number of different tandem MS experiments, which each have their own applications and offer their own information.  An instrument equipped for tandem MS can still be used to run MS experiments.  Tandem MS can be done in either time or space.  Tandem MS in space involves the physical separation of the instrument components (QqQ or QTOF), tandem MS in time involves the use of an [[ion trap]].

===Tandem MS modes===
There are four main scan experiments possible using MS/MS.

* '''Precursor ion scan'''
** A precursor ion is selected in the first stage, allowed to fragment and then all resultant masses are detected in the second mass analyzer.  This experiment is commonly performed to identify transitions used for quantification by tandem MS.

* '''Product ion scan'''
** The product ion is selected in the second mass analyzer, and the precursor masses are scanned in the first mass analyzer.  A precursor ion scan cannot be done with time based MS instruments.

* '''Neutral loss scan'''
** The first mass analyzer scans all the masses.  The second mass analyzer also scans, but at a set offset from the first mass analyzer.  This offset corresponds to a neutral loss that is commonly observed for the class of compounds.  Neutral loss scans cannot be done with time based MS instruments either.

*'''Selected reaction monitoring'''
** Both mass analyzers are set to a selected mass.  This mode is analogous to selected ion monitoring for MS experiments.  A very selective analysis mode, which can increase sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = deHoffman  | first = Edmond  | authorlink =  | coauthors = Stroobant, Vincent  | title = Mass Spectrometry: Principles and Applications  | publisher = Wiley  | date = 2003  | location = Toronto  | pages = 133  | url =  | doi =  | id =    | isbn = 0471485667 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fragmentation in tandem mass spectrometry==
Fragmentation of gas-phase ions is essential to tandem mass spectrometry and occurs between different stages of mass analysis. There are many methods used to fragment the ions and can result in different types of fragmentation and thus different information about the structure and composition of the molecule.

===In-source fragmentation===
Often, the [[ionization]] process is sufficiently violent to leave the resulting ions with sufficient [[internal energy]] to fragment within the mass spectrometer. If the product ions persist in their non-equilibrium state for a moderate amount of time before auto-dissociation this process is called [[metastable]] fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;IUPAC gold book definition of ''metastable ion (in mass spectrometry)'' [http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/M03874.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;IUPAC gold book definition of ''transient (chemical) species'' [http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/T06451.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Nozzle-skimmer fragmentation refers to the purposeful induction of in-source fragmentation by increasing the nozzle-skimmer potential on usually [[electrospray ionization|electrospray]] based instruments. Although in-source fragmentation allows for fragmentation analysis, it is not technically  tandem mass spectrometry unless metastable ions are mass analyzed or selected before auto-dissociation and a second stage of analysis is performed on the resulting fragments. In-source fragmentation is often used in addition to tandem mass spectrometry (with post-source fragmentation) to allow for two steps of fragmentation in a pseudo MS&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-type of experiment.&lt;ref&gt;JAMS Vol. 7, Feb. 1996, pp 150-156 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/1044-0305(95)00626-5]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-source fragmentation===

Post-source fragmentation is most often what is being used in a tandem mass spectrometry experiment. Energy can also be added to the, usually already vibrationally excited, ions through post-source collisions with neutral atoms or molecules, the absorption of radiation, or the transfer or capture of an electron by a multiply charged ion. [[Collision-induced dissociation]] (CID), also called collisionally activated dissociation (CAD), involves the collision of an ion with a neutral atom or molecule in the gas phase and subsequent dissociation of the ion.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16401509&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wells JM, McLuckey SA |title=Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of peptides and proteins |journal=Meth. Enzymol. |volume=402 |issue= |pages=148-85 |year=2005 |pmid=16401509 |doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(05)02005-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15481084&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sleno L, Volmer DA |title=Ion activation methods for tandem mass spectrometry |journal=Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=1091-112 |year=2004 |pmid=15481084 |doi=10.1002/jms.703}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider 
:&lt;math&gt;AB^+ + M \to A + B^+ + M&lt;/math&gt; 

where the ion &lt;math&gt;AB^+&lt;/math&gt; collides with the neutral species M and subsequently breaks apart. The details of this process are described by [[collision theory]].

If an [[electron]] is added to a multiply-charged positive ion, the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb energy]] is liberated. Adding a free electron is called [[electron capture dissociation]] (ECD),&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15389856&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cooper HJ, Håkansson K, Marshall AG |title=The role of electron capture dissociation in biomolecular analysis |journal=Mass spectrometry reviews |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=201-22 |year=2005 |pmid=15389856 |doi=10.1002/mas.20014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is represented by

:&lt;math&gt;[M + nH]^{n+} + e^- \to \bigg[ [M + (n-1)H]^{(n-1)+} \bigg]^* \to fragments&lt;/math&gt;

for a multiply-protonated molecule M. Adding an electron through an ion-ion reaction is called  [[electron transfer dissociation]] (ETD),&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15210983&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Syka JE, Coon JJ, Schroeder MJ, Shabanowitz J, Hunt DF |title=Peptide and protein sequence analysis by electron transfer dissociation mass spectrometry |journal=Proc.

'''Tandem mass tags (TMT)''' are chemical labels used for [[mass spectrometry]] (MS) based quantitation and identification of biological [[macromolecule]]s such as [[protein]]s, [[peptides]] and [[nucleic acids]]. TMT belongs to a family of reagents referred to as [[isobaric labeling|isobaric mass tags]]. They provide an alternative to gel- or [[Antibody|antibody-based]] quantitation but may also be used in combination with these and other methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12713048&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thompson A, Schäfer J, Kuhn K ''et al.'' |title=Tandem mass tags: a novel quantification strategy for comparative analysis of complex protein mixtures by MS/MS |journal=Anal. Chem. |volume=75 |issue=8 |pages=1895–904 |year=2003 |pmid=12713048 |doi=10.1021/ac0262560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
There are currently three varieties of TMT available:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TMTzero - a non-isotopically substituted core structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TMTduplex - an isobaric pair of mass tags with a single isotopic substitution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TMTsixplex - an isobaric set of six mass tags with five isotopic substitutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The tags contain four regions, namely a mass reporter region (M), a cleavable linker region (F), a mass normalization region (N) and a protein reactive group (R). The chemical structures of all the tags are identical but each contains [[isotopes]] substituted at various positions, such that the mass reporter and mass normalization regions have different [[molecular mass]]es in each tag. The combined M-F-N-R regions of the tags have the same total molecular weights and structure so that during [[Chromatography|chromatographic]] or [[Gel electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] separation and in single MS mode, molecules labelled with different tags are indistinguishable. Upon fragmentation in [[Tandem_mass_spectrometry#Tandem_MS_.28MS.2FMS.29|MS/MS]] mode, sequence information is obtained from fragmentation of the [[Peptide bond|peptide back bone]] and quantitation data are simultaneously obtained from fragmentation of the tags, giving rise to mass reporter ions.

Proteome Sciences Plc have the patents for TMT technology. These patents have broad coverage of all tandem mass tag technology.

== Bioinformatics Integration ==

The [[Chemical structure|structures]] of TMT tags are publicly available through the unimod database at unimod.org and hence, [[mass spectrometry software]] such as [[Mascot (software)|Mascot]] are able to account for the tag masses. Additionally, as of version 2.2, [[Mascot (software)|Mascot]] has the capability to quantitate using TMT and other isobaric mass tags without the use of additional software.

[[Image:Taylor cone.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Electrospray diagram depicting the Taylor cone, jet and plume]]
A '''Taylor cone''' refers to the cone observed in [[electrospinning]], [[electrospray]] and hydrodynamic spray processes from which a jet of charged particles emanates above a threshold voltage. Aside from [[electrospray ionization]] in [[mass spectrometry]] the Taylor cone is important in [[colloid thruster]]s used in fine control and high efficiency (low power) thrust of spacecraft. 

== History ==

This cone was described by Sir [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor]] in 1964 before electrospray was &quot;discovered&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sir Geoffrey Taylor | year = 1964 | title = Disintegration of Water Droplets in an Electric Field | journal = [[Proceedings_of_the_Royal_Society_A#Proceedings_of_the_Royal_Society_A|Proc.

Series A|date=October 01, 1931|first=W.

== Taylor cone formation ==

When a small volume of electrically conductive liquid is exposed to an electric field ,the shape of liquid starts to deform from the shape caused by surface tension alone. As the voltage is increased the effect of the electric field becomes more prominent and as it approaches exerting a similar amount of force on the droplet as the surface tension does a cone shape begins to form with convex sides and a rounded tip. This approaches the shape of a straight [[generatrix]] ([[Cone (geometry)|cone]]) with a whole angle (width) of 98.6°. When a certain threshold voltage has been reached the slightly rounded tip inverts and emits a jet of liquid. This is called a cone-jet and is the beginning of the [[electrospray]] process in which ions may be transferred to the gas phase. It is generally found that in order to achieve a stable cone-jet a slightly higher than threshold voltage must be used. As the voltage is increased even more other modes of droplet disintegration are found. The term Taylor cone can specifically refer to the theoretical limit of a perfect cone of exactly  the predicted angle or generally refer to the approximately conical portion of a cone-jet after the electrospray process has begun.

== Theory ==

Sir [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor]] in 1964 described this phenomenon, theoretically derived based on general assumptions that the requirements to form a perfect cone under such conditions required a semi-vertical angle of 49.3° (a whole angle of 98.6°) and demonstrated that the shape of such a cone approached the theoretical shape just before jet formation.  This angle is known as the '''Taylor angle'''.  This angle is more precisely &lt;math&gt;\pi-\theta _0\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\theta _0\,&lt;/math&gt; is the first zero of &lt;math&gt;P _{1/2} (\cos\theta _0)\,&lt;/math&gt; (the [[Legendre polynomial]] of order 1/2).

Taylor's derivation is based on two assumptions: (1) that the surface of the cone is an equipotential surface and (2) that the cone exists in a steady state equilibrium. To meet both of these criteria the electric field must have [[azimuth]]al symmetry and have &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{R}\,&lt;/math&gt; dependence to counter the surface tension to produce the cone. The solution to this problem is:

:&lt;math&gt;V=V_0+AR^{1/2}P _{1/2} (\cos\theta _0)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V=V_0\,&lt;/math&gt; (equipotential surface) exists at a value of &lt;math&gt;\theta _0&lt;/math&gt; (regardless of R) producing an equipotential cone.  The magic angle necessary for &lt;math&gt;V=V_0\,&lt;/math&gt; for all R is a zero of &lt;math&gt;P _{1/2} (\cos\theta _0)\,&lt;/math&gt; between 0 and &lt;math&gt;\pi\,&lt;/math&gt; which there is only one at 130.7099°.  The complement of this angle is the Taylor angle.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline (TOPP) is a set of computational tools that can be chained together to tailor problem-specific analysis pipelines for HPLC-MS data. It transforms most of the OpenMS functionality into small command line tools that are the building blocks for more complex analysis pipelines. The functionality of the tools ranges from data preprocessing (file format conversion, baseline reduction, noise reduction, peak picking, map alignment,...) over quantitation (isotope-labeled and label-free) to identification (wrapper tools for Mascot, Sequest, InsPecT and OMSSA).

TOPP is developed in the groups of Prof. Knut Reinert[http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/inst/ag-bio/] at the Free University of Berlin and in the group of Prof. Kohlbacher[http://www-bs.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/] at the University of Tübingen.

'''Thermal infrared spectroscopy''' (TIR spectroscopy) is the subset of [[infrared spectroscopy]] that deals with radiation emitted in the infrared part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].  The emitted infrared radiation, though similar to blackbody radiation, is different in that the radiation is banded at characteristic vibrations in the material.  The method measures the thermal [[infrared]] radiation emitted (as opposed to being transmitted or reflected) from a volume or surface.  This method is commonly used to identify the composition of surface by analyzing its  [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] and comparing it to previously measured materials. It is particularly suited to airborne and spaceborne applications.

==Thermal infrared spectrometers==
===Airborne===
*TIMS: a multispectral radiometer flown on C-130, ER-2, and the Stennis Learjet aircraft.
*SEBASS: a hyperspectral sensor developed and operated by The Aerospace Corporation.

===Spaceborne===
*ISM: An imaging spectrometer on board the Soviet [[Phobos 2]] spacecraft.
*[[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer|ASTER]]: a multispectral radiometer on board the Earth-observing [[Terra_(satellite)|Terra]] satellite.
*[[Thermal Emission Spectrometer|TES]]: A [[hyperspectral]] spectrometer on board the [[Mars Global Surveyor]] spacecraft.
*[[Mini-TES]]: a small version of the TES instrument carried on both [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s.
*[[THEMIS]]: a multispectral thermal infrared imager on board the [[2001 Mars Odyssey]] spacecraft.

The '''thomson''' (symbol: '''Th''') is a unit that has appeared infrequently in scientific literature relating to the field of [[mass spectrometry]] as a unit of [[mass-to-charge ratio]]. The unit was proposed by Cooks and Rockwood&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|title=The 'Thomson'. A suggested unit for mass spectroscopists|journal=[[Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry]]|date=1991|first=R. G.|last=Cooks|coauthors=A. L. Rockwood|volume=5|issue=2|pages=93|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=2007-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; naming it in honour of [[J. J. Thomson]] who measured the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of electrons and ions.

==Definition==
The thomson is defined as follows.

:&lt;math&gt; 1~\mathrm{Th} \equiv 1~\frac{\mathrm{u}}{e} \equiv 1~\frac{\mathrm{Da}}{e} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''u''' represents the [[atomic mass unit]], Da represents the unit dalton, and ''e'' represents the [[elementary charge]] which is the [[electric charge]] [[unit]] in the [[atomic unit]] system.

For example, for the ion C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H{{su|b=7|p=2+}} has an exact mass of 91.0&amp;nbsp;Da. Its charge number is +2, and hence its charge is 2''e''. The ion will be observed at 45.5 Th in a mass spectrum. 

An interesting part of their proposal allowed for negative values for negatively charged ions. For example, the [[benzoate]] anion would be observed at ''m/z'' 121, but at −121 Th since the charge is −e.

Unfortunately, the article proposing the unit of the thomson contains an ambiguity relating to the specification of charge. In one place the article refers to &quot;charge number&quot;, but in another place the article specifies charge in atomic charge units: &quot;Using standard rules for abbreviation, we have 1 Th = 1 u / atomic charge.&quot; Or in other words the units of the thomson are units of mass ''u'' (unified atomic mass units) divided by units of charge ''e'' (atomic or elementary charge). This unfortunate ambiguity may have contributed to the controversy over the unit. The ambiguity about specification of charge does not affect the numerical value assigned to the mass-to-charge ratio of an ion, but instead relates to the dimensionality to be associated with the quantity. Clarification of the original intent of the authors has not appeared in the literature, although in private communications Rockwood states that the intended dimensionality was mass/charge with the specific units being unified atomic mass units per elementary charge. 
It is also worth mentioning that the m/z as it is currently defined by a IUPAC body (as unitless) is not compatible with either interpretations discussed above.

The thomson has been used by some mass spectrometrists, for example [[Alexander Makarov]]—the inventor of the [[Orbitrap]]—in a scientific poster,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asms.org/asms99pdf/095.pdf The Orbitrap: a novel high-performance electrostatic trap (ASMS)]&lt;/ref&gt; papers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pakenham G, Lango J, Buonarati M, Morin D, Buckpitt A |title=Urinary naphthalene mercapturates as biomarkers of exposure and stereoselectivity of naphthalene epoxidation |journal=Drug Metab.

In his book, ''Mass Spectrometry Desk Reference'', Sparkman argues strongly against the use of the thomson.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-9660813-2-3&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Sparkman, O. David |title=Mass spectrometry desk reference |publisher=Global View Pub |location=Pittsburgh |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-9660813-2-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his arguments
were against a dimensionless unit because of the possible confusion with the [[Thomson number]] in fluid dynamics, [[Thomson scattering]], and the [[Thomson coefficient]] (the latter named after [[Lord Kelvin]]). He seems not to have realized that the unit &quot;thomson&quot; is not dimensionless but actually of dimension mass/charge and that therefore the possibility of confusion is minimal.

The thomson is not an [[SI unit]], nor is it currently accepted by [[IUPAC]]; however, it can be argued that the thomson complies better to the international standards about quantities and units as described in [[ISO 31]] and the [[IUPAC green book]] than the &quot;unitless&quot; [[m/z]] that is widely used for labeling [[mass spectra]].

The '''time of flight''' (TOF) describes the method used to measure the time that it takes for a particle, object or stream to reach a detector while traveling over a known distance. In [[time-of-flight mass spectrometry]], ions are accelerated by an electrical field to the same [[kinetic energy]] with the velocity of the ion depending on the [[mass-to-charge ratio]]. Thus the time-of-flight can be used to determine the mass-to-charge ratio.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |author=Cotter, Robert J. |title=Time-of-flight mass spectrometry |publisher=American Chemical Society |location=Columbus, OH |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-8412-3474-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time-of-flight of [[electron]]s is used to measure their kinetic energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/764241-IyAfiC/webviewable/764241.pdf Time-of-Flight Techniques For The Investigation Of Kinetic Energy Distributions Of Ions And Neutrals Desorbed By Core Excitations]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[near infrared spectroscopy]], the time-of-flight method is used to estimate the wavelength dependent optical pathlength. With an [[ultrasonic flow meter]] measurement, the principle is used to work out speed of signal propagation upstream and downstream of flow, in order to estimate total flow velocity. Optical time-of-flight sensors also exist, but depend on timing individual particles following the flow rather than using Doppler changes in the flow itself (as this would require generally high flow velocities and extremely narrow-band optical filters; see [[planar Doppler velocimetry]]). In [[kinematics]], TOF is the duration in which a projectile is travelling through the air. Given the initial velocity &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; of the particle, the downward (i.e. gravitational) acceleration &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and the projectile's angle of projection θ (measured relative to the horizontal), then a simple rearrangement of the [[SUVAT equations|SUVAT equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;s = vt - \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} at^2&lt;/math&gt;

results in this equation 

:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac {2u \sin \theta} {a}&lt;/math&gt;

for the time of flight of a projectile.

== Time-of-flight mass spectrometry ==
[[Time-of-flight mass spectrometry]] (TOFMS) is a method of [[mass spectrometry]] in which [[ion]]s are accelerated by an [[electric field]] of known strength. This acceleration results in an ion having the same [[kinetic energy]] as any other ion that has the same charge. The velocity of the ion depends on the [[mass-to-charge ratio]]. The time that it subsequently takes for the particle to reach a detector at a known distance is measured.  This time will depend on the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of the particle (heavier particles reach lower speeds).  From this time and the known experimental parameters one can find the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of the ion.

== Ultrasonic flow meter and optical time-of-flight ==
An [[ultrasonic flow meter]] measures the velocity of a liquid or gas through a pipe using acoustic sensors.  This has some advantages over other measurement techniques. The results are slightly affected by temperature, density or conductivity.  Maintenance is inexpensive because there are no [[moving parts]].

Ultrasonic flow meters come in three different types: transmission (contrapropagating transit time) flowmeters, reflection (Doppler) flowmeters, and open-channel flowmeters. Transit time flowmeters work by measuring the time difference between an ultrasonic pulse sent in the flow direction and an ultrasound pulse sent opposite the flow direction. Doppler flowmeters measure the [[doppler shift]] resulting in reflecting an ultrasonic beam off either small particles in the fluid, air bubbles in the fluid, or the flowing fluid's turbulence. Open channel flow measure upstream levels in front of [[Flume|flumes]] or [[Weir|weirs]].

Optical time-of-flight sensors consist of two light beams projected into the fluid whose detection is either interrupted or instigated by the passage of small particles (which are assumed to be following the flow). This is not dissimilar from the optical beams used as safety devices in motorized garage doors or as triggers in alarm systems. The speed of the particles is calculated by knowing the spacing between the two beams. If there is only one detector, then the time difference can be measured via [[autocorrelation]]. If there are two detectors, one for each beam, then direction can also be known. Since the location of the beams is relatively easy to determine, the precision of the measurement depends primarily on how small the setup can be made. If the beams are too far apart, the flow could change substantially between them, thus the measurement becomes an average over that space. Moreover, multiple particles could reside between them at any given time, and this would corrupt the signal since the particles are indistinguishable. For such a sensor to provide valid data, it must be small relative to the scale of the flow and the seeding density. [[MOEMS]] approaches yield extremely small packages, making such sensors applicable in a variety of situations&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1  = Modarress|first1 = D. | last2 = Svitek | first2 = P. | last3 = Modarress | first3 = K. | last4 = Wilson | first4 = D. | title = Micro-optical sensors for boundary layer flow studies | journal = 2006 ASME Joint U.S.-European Fluids Engineering Summer Meeting | year = 2006 | month = July | url = http://www.measurementsci.com/papers/FEDSM06_98556.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== High-precision measurements in physics ==
Usually the tube is praised for simplicity, but for precision measurements of charged low energy particles the electric and the magnetic field in the flight tube has to be controlled within 10 mV and 1 nT respectively.

The work function homogeneity of the tube can be controlled by a [[Kelvin probe force microscope|Kelvin probe]]. The magnetic field can be measured by a [[fluxgate compass]]. High frequencies are passively shielded and damped by [[radar absorbent material]]. To generate arbitrary low frequencies field the screen is parted into plates (overlapping and connected by capacitors) with bias voltage on each plate and a bias current on coil behind plate whose flux is closed by an outer core. In this way the tube can be configured to act as a weak achromatic quadrupole lens with an aperture with a grid and a delay line detector in the diffraction plane to do angle resolved measurements. Changing the field the angle of the field of view can be changed and a deflecting bias can be superimposed to scan through all angles.

When no delay line detector is used focusing the ions onto a detector can be accomplished through the use of two or three [[einzel lens]]es placed in the vacuum tube located between the ion source and the detector.

The sample should be immersed into the tube with holes and apertures for and against stray light to do magnetic experiments and to control the electrons from their start.

In chemistry, '''topicity''' is the stereochemical relationship of substituents relative to the structure to which they are attached. Depending on the relationship, such groups can be ''heterotopic'', ''homotopic'', ''enantiotopic'', or ''diastereotopic''.

==Homotopic==
'''Homotopic groups''' in a chemical compound are equivalent groups. Two groups A and B are homotopic if the molecule remains the same (including stereochemically) when the groups are interchanged with the remaining parts of the molecule fixed. Homotopic atoms are always identical, in any environment. Homotopic NMR-active nuclei have the same chemical shift in an [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] spectrum.  For example, the four hydrogen atoms of [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) are homotopic with one another, as are the two hydrogens or the two chlorines in [[dichloromethane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Enantiotopic==
The [[stereochemistry|stereochemical]] term '''enantiotopic''' refers to the relationship between two groups in a molecule which, if one or the other were replaced, would generate a [[chiral]] compound. The two possible compounds resulting from that replacement would be [[enantiomer]]s. 

For example, the two hydrogen atoms attached to the second carbon in [[butane]] are enantiotopic.  Replacement of one hydrogen atom (colored blue) with a bromine atom will produce (''R'')-2-bromobutane.  Replacement of the other hydrogen atom (colored red) with a bromine atom will produce the enantiomer (''S'')-2-bromobutane. 


{| cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;

|-
| align=&quot;center&quot;| Butane || (''R'')-2-bromobutane || (''S'')-2-bromobutane
|}

Enantiotopic groups are identical and indistinguishable except in chiral environments. For instance, the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogens in [[ethanol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH) are normally enantiotopic, but can be made different ([[#Diastereotopic|diastereotopic]]) if combined with a chiral center, for instance by conversion to an [[ester]] of a chiral [[carboxylic acid]] such as [[lactic acid]], or if coordinated to a chiral metal center, or if associated with an [[enzyme]] [[active site]], since enzymes are constituted of chiral [[amino acid|amino acids]]. Indeed, in the presence of the enzyme [[liver alcohol dehydrogenase|LADH]], one specific hydrogen is removed from the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group during the oxidation of ethanol to [[acetaldehyde]], and it gets replaced in the same place during the reverse reaction. The chiral environment needs not be optically pure for this effect. 

Enantiotopic groups are mirror images of each other about an internal plane of symmetry. A chiral environment removes that symmetry. Enantiotopic pairs of NMR-active nuclei are also indistinguishable by NMR and produce a single signal. 

Enantiotopic groups need not be attached to the same atom. For example, two hydrogen atoms adjacent to the carbonyl group in ''cis''-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone are enantiotopic; they are related by an internal plane of symmetry passing through the carbonyl group, but deprotonation on one side of the carbonyl group or on the other will generate compounds which are enantiomers. Similarly, replacement of one or the other with [[deuterium]] will generate enantiomers.

==Diastereotopic==
The [[stereochemistry|stereochemical]] term '''diastereotopic''' refers to the relationship between two groups in a molecule which, if replaced, would generate compounds that are [[diastereomer]]s. Diastereotopic groups are often, but not always, identical groups attached to the same atom in a molecule containing at least one chiral center. 

For example, the two hydrogen atoms of the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; moiety in (''S'')-2-bromobutane are diastereotopic.  Replacement of one hydrogen atom (colored blue) with a bromine atom will produce (''2S,3R'')-2,3-dibromobutane.  Replacement of the other hydrogen atom (colored red) with a bromine atom will produce the diastereomer (''2S,3S'')-2,3-dibromobutane. 

{| cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; 
| align=&quot;center&quot;| [[Image:diastereotopic1.png|120px]]||[[Image:diastereotopic3.png|120px]] ||[[Image:diastereotopic2.png|120px]]
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot;| (''S'')-2-bromobutane || (''2S,3R'')-2,3-dibromobutane|| (''2S,3S'')-2,3-dibromobutane
|}

In chiral molecules containing diastereotopic groups, such as in 2-bromobutane, there is no requirement for enantiomeric or [[optical purity]]; no matter its proportion, each enantiomer will generate enantiomeric sets of diastereomers upon substitution of diastereotopic groups (though, as in the case of substitution by bromine in 2-bromobutane, [[meso]] isomers have, strictly speaking, no enantiomer). 

Diastereotopic groups are not mirror images of one another about any plane. They are always different, in any environment, but may not be distinguishable. For instance, both pairs of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogens in ethyl phenylalaninate hydrochloride (PhCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)COOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) are diastereotopic and both give pairs of distinct &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR signals in DMSO-d&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; at 300 MHz,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/spectra/fnmr/FNMR003282.PDF 300 MHz &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR spectrum of ethyl phenylalaninate hydrochloride in DMSO-d&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; from Sigma-Aldrich Co.]&lt;/ref&gt; but in the similar ethyl 2-nitrobutanoate (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)COOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), only the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group next to the chiral center gives distinct signals from its two hydrogens with the same instrument in CDCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/spectra/fnmr/FNMR008528.PDF 300 MHz &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR spectrum of ethyl 2-nitrobutanoate in CDCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from Sigma-Aldrich Co.]&lt;/ref&gt; Such signals are often complex because of small differences in chemical shift, overlap and an additional strong coupling between [[geminal]] hydrogens. On the other hand, the two CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups of ipsenol, which are three bonds away from the chiral center, give separate &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H doublets at 300 MHz and separate &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-NMR signals in CDCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Silverstein, R. et al.: Spectrometric Identification of Organic Compounds, 7th ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; but the diastereotopic hydrogens in ethyl alaninate hydrochloride (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)COOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), also three bonds away from the chiral center, show barely distinguishable &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR signals in DMSO-d&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/spectra/fnmr/FNMR009035.PDF 300 MHz &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR spectrum of ethyl alaninate hydrochloride in DMSO-d&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; from Sigma-Aldrich Co.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:DIASTERE.GIF|thumb|Figure 1. Diastereotopic hydrogens in achiral compounds.]] 
Diastereotopic groups also arise in achiral molecules. For instance, any one pair of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogens in 3-pentanol (Figure 1) are diastereotopic, as the two CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carbons are [[#Enantiotopic|enantiotopic]]. Substitution of any one of the four CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogens creates two chiral centers at once, and the two possible hydrogen substitution products at any one CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carbon will be diastereomers. This kind of relationship is often easier to detect in cyclic molecules. For instance, any pair of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogens in cyclopentanol (Figure 1) are similarly diastereotopic, and this is easily discerned as one of the hydrogens in the pair will be ''cis'' to the OH group (on the same side of the ring face) while the other will be ''trans'' to it (on the opposite side). 

The term diastereotopic is also applied to identical groups attached to the same end of an alkene moiety which, if replaced, would generate [[geometric isomers]] (also falling in the category of diastereomers). Thus, the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogens of [[propene]] are diastereotopic, one being ''cis'' to the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group, and the other being ''trans'' to it, and replacement of one or the other with CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; would generate ''cis-'' or ''trans-''-2-[[butene]]. 

[[Image:DIASTER2.GIF|thumb|Figure 2. Diastereotopic hydrogens in a chiral metal complex.]] Diastereotopicity is not limited to organic molecules, nor to groups attached to carbon, nor to molecules with chiral tetrahedral (''sp''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized) centers: for instance, the pair of hydrogens in any CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group in ''tris''(ethylenediamine)chromium(III) ion (Cr(en)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), where the metal center is chiral, are diastereotopic (Figure 2). 

The terms enantiotopic and diastereotopic can also be applied to the faces of planar groups (especially carbonyl groups and alkene moities).  See [[Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rule]].

The '''Transition dipole moment''' or '''Transition moment''', usually denoted &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathbf{d}_{nm}}&lt;/math&gt; for a transition between an initial state, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{m}&lt;/math&gt;, and a final state, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{n}&lt;/math&gt;, is the [[electric dipole moment]] associated with the transition between the two states.  In general the transition dipole moment is a [[Complex number|complex]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] quantity that includes the phase factors associated with the two states.  Its direction gives the polarization of the transition, which determines how the system will interact with an electromagnetic wave of a given polarization, while the square of the magnitude gives the strength of the interaction due to the distribution of charge within the system.  The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of the transition dipole moment is the [[Coulomb]] [[meter]] (Cm); a more conveniently sized unit is the [[Debye]] (D).

== Definition ==

The transition dipole moment for the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{m\, \rightarrow\, n}&lt;/math&gt; transition is given by the relevant off-diagonal element of the dipole matrix, which can be calculated from an integral taken over the product of the wavefunctions of the initial and final states of the transition, and the dipole moment operator,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{d}} = e\left(\sum_i x_i, \sum_i y_i, \sum_i z_i\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

where the [[summation]]s are over the positions of the [[electron]]s in the system.  Giving the transition dipole moment:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d}_{nm} = \int \Psi^*_n \,\, \mathbf{\hat{d}} \,\, \Psi_m \, d^3r = \langle\Psi_n|\,\mathbf{\hat{d}}\,|\Psi_m\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,

where the integral is in principle over all space, but it can be restricted to the region in which the initial and final state wavefunctions are non-negligible.

== Analogy with a classical dipole ==
{{main|Electric dipole moment}}

A basic, phenomenological understanding of the transition dipole moment can be obtained by analogy with a classical dipole.  While the comparison can be very useful, care must be taken to ensure that one does not fall into the trap of assuming they are the same.

In the case of two classical point charges, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{+q}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{-q}&lt;/math&gt;, with a [[displacement (vector)|displacement vector]], &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;, pointing from the negative charge to the positive charge, the electric dipole moment is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = q\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the presence of an [[electric field]], such as that due to an electromagnetic wave, the two charges will experience a force in opposite directions, leading to a net [[torque]] on the dipole.  The magnitude of the torque is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to both the magnitude of the charges and the separation between them, and varies with the relative angles of the field and the dipole:

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{\tau}| = |q\mathbf{r}||\mathbf{E}|\sin\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, the coupling between an electromagnetic wave and an atomic transition with transition dipole moment &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathbf{d}_{nm}}&lt;/math&gt;, depends on the charge distribution within the atom, the strength of the electric field, and the relative polarizations of the field and the transition.  In addition, the transition dipole moment depends on the geometries and relative phases of the initial and final states.

== Origin ==

When an atom or molecule interacts with an electromagnetic wave of frequency &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;, it can undergo a transition to a higher energy state by absorbing a [[photon]] or a lower energy state by emitting a photon, provided that the energy difference between the initial and final states &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{(\Delta E)}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as the photon energy &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{(\hbar\omega)}&lt;/math&gt;.  The presence of the electromagnetic field can induce an oscillating [[electric dipole moment]], referred to as the transition dipole moment.  If the charge, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{e}&lt;/math&gt;, is omitted one obtains &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathbf{R}_\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; as used in [[oscillator strength]].

== Applications ==

The transition dipole moment is useful for determining if transitions are allowed under the electric dipole interaction. For example, the transition from a bonding &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; orbital to an antibonding &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\pi^*}&lt;/math&gt; orbital is allowed because the [[integral]] defining the transition dipole moment is nonzero. Such a transition occurs between an [[Even and odd functions#Even functions|even]] and an [[Even and odd functions#Odd functions|odd]] orbital; the dipole operator is an odd function of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;, hence the [[Integral#Terminology and notation|integrand]] is an even function.  The integral of an odd function over symmetric limits returns a value of zero, while for an even function this is not ''necessarily'' the case.  This result is reflected in the [[parity (physics)|parity]] [[selection rule]] for electric dipole transitions.

'''Transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy''' (TROSY) is an experiment in [[protein NMR]] spectroscopy that allows studies of large molecules or complexes.

The application of [[NMR]] to large molecules is normally limited by the fact that the line widths generally increase with [[molecular mass]]. Larger molecules have longer rotational correlation times and consequently shorter transverse relaxation times (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In other words, the [[Free induction decay|NMR signal]] from larger molecules decays more rapidly, leading to line broadening in the NMR spectrum and so poor [[Optical resolution|resolution]].

In an [[HSQC]] spectrum in which [[Nuclear magnetic resonance decoupling|decoupling]] has not been applied, peaks appear as multiplets due to [[J-coupling]].  Crucially the different multiplet components have different widths.  This is due to constructive or destructive interaction between different [[Relaxation (NMR)|relaxation]] mechanisms.  Typically relaxation for large proteins at high [[magnetic field]] strengths the transverse (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is dominated by the dipole-dipole (DD) mechanism and the  [[chemical shift]] anisotropy (CSA) mechanism. As the relaxation mechanisms are generally correlated but contribute to the overall relaxation rate of a given component with different signs, the multiplet components relax with very different overall rates.  The TROSY experiment&lt;ref name=pervushin97&gt;K. Pervushin, R. Riek, G. Wider, and K. Wüthrich (1997) ''Attenuated T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; relaxation by mutual cancellation of dipole-dipole coupling and chemical shift anisotropy indicates an avenue to NMR structures of very large biological macromolecules in solution.'' Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA '''94''' 12366-71 PMID 9356455&lt;/ref&gt; is designed to select the component for which the different relaxation mechanisms have almost cancelled, leading to a single, sharp peak in the spectrum.  This significantly increases both spectral resolution and sensitivity, both of which are at a premium when studying large and complex biomolecules.

This approach significantly extends the molecular mass range that can be studied by NMR, but it generally requires high magnetic fields to achieve the necessary balance between the CSA and DD relaxation mechanisms; CSAs scale with field strength, while [[Dipolar coupling|dipole-dipole couplings]] are field-independent.

'''Triatomic molecules''' are formed by three atoms. Examples include H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HCN etc.

==Molecular vibrations==

The vibrational modes of a triatomic molecule can be determined in specific cases.

=== Symmetric linear molecules ===
A symmetric linear molecule ABA can perform:
* Antisymmetric longitudinal vibrations with frequency
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_a=\sqrt{\frac{k_1M}{m_Am_B}}&lt;/math&gt;
* Symmetric longitudinal vibrations with frequency
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{s1}=\sqrt{\frac{k_1}{m_A}}&lt;/math&gt;
* Symmetric transversal vibrations with frequency
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{s2}=\sqrt{\frac{2k_2M}{m_A}}&lt;/math&gt;
In the previous formulas, ''M'' is the total mass of the molecule, ''m&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''m&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the masses of the elements A and B, ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the spring constants of the molecule along its axis and perpendicular to it.

Ozone, O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is an example of a triatomic molecule with all atoms the same.  Triatomic hydrogen, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is unstable and breaks up spontaneously.  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the trihydrogen cation is stable by itself and is symmetric.

[[File:Quattro II triple quadropole mass spectrometer.jpg|right|thumb|300 px|Waters Quattro II triple quadropole mass spectrometer (center).]]
A '''triple quadrupole mass spectrometer''' is a [[tandem mass spectrometry|tandem mass spectrometer]] consisting of two [[quadrupole mass spectrometer]]s in series, with a (non mass-resolving) radio frequency (RF) only quadrupole between them to act as a collision cell for [[collision-induced dissociation]]. The first (Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and third (Q&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) quadrupoles serve as mass filters, whereas the middle (q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) quadrupole serves as a collision cell.  This collision cell is an RF only quadrupole (non-mass filtering) using an inert gas such as Ar, He or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas to provide [[collision-induced dissociation]] of a selected precursor ion that is selected in Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  Subsequent fragments are passed through to Q&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; where they may be filtered or scanned.

==Structural mass spectrometry==
This alignment of two mass spectrometers in succession with a collision cell (e.g. a collision quadrupole) in between allows structural mass spectrometry to be performed.  For example, the Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; may be set to select an ion of a known mass, which is fragmented in q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The third quadrupole (Q&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is then set to scan the entire ''[[m/z]]'' range, giving information on the sizes of the fragments made.  From the ion fragmentation information, the structure of the original ion can be deduced.

==History==
The arrangement of three quadrupoles was first developed by Morrizon of [[LaTrobe University]], Australia for the purpose of studying the photodissociation of gas-phase ions.&lt;ref name=Morrison1991&gt;{{citation | last = Morrison | first =  J.

[[Image:2dir pulse sequence newversion.png|thumb|300px|right|Pulse Sequence used to obtain a two-dimensional [[Fourier transform]] infrared spectrum. The time period &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; is usually referred to as the coherence time and the second time period &lt;math&gt;\tau_2&lt;/math&gt; is known as the waiting time.

'''Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy'''  ('''2DIR''') is a [[nonlinear]] [[infrared spectroscopy]] technique that has the ability to correlate [[vibrational modes]] in condensed-phase systems. This technique provides information beyond linear infrared spectra, by spreading the vibrational information along multiple axes, yielding a frequency correlation spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = P.

==Systems studied==
Among the many systems studied with infrared spectroscopy are [[water]], [[metal carbonyl]]s, short [[polypeptide]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[DNA]] oligomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = S.

==Experimental Approaches==
There are two main approaches to two-dimensional spectroscopy, the [[Fourier transform|Fourier-transform]] method, in which the data is collected in the [[time-domain]] and then Fourier-transformed to obtain a frequency-frequency 2D correlation spectrum, and the [[frequency domain]] approach in which all the data is collected directly in the frequency domain. 

===Time domain===
The time-domain approach consists of applying two pump pulses. The first pulse creates a [[Coherence (physics)|coherence]] between the vibrational modes of the molecule and the second pulse creates a population, effectively storing information in the molecules. After a determined waiting time, ranging from a zero to a few hundred [[picosecond]]s, an interaction with a third pulse again creates a coherence, which, due to an oscillating dipole, radiates an [[infrared]] signal. The radiated signal is heterodyned with a reference pulse in order to retrieve [[frequency]] and [[phase (waves)|phase]] information; the signal is usually collected in the frequency domain using a [[spectrometer]] yielding detection frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_3&lt;/math&gt;. A two-dimensional Fourier-transform along &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; then yields a (&lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\omega_3&lt;/math&gt;) correlation spectrum.

===Frequency domain===
Similarly, in the frequency-domain approach, a narrowband pump pulse is applied and, after a certain waiting time, then a broadband pulse probes the system. A 2DIR correlation spectrum is obtained by plotting the probe frequency spectrum at each pump frequency.

==Spectral Interpretation==
[[Image:Schematic of typical two-dimensional infrared spectrum.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Schematic picture of a 2DIR spectrum. The blue peaks on the diagonal corresponds to bleaching of the ground state. The red peaks corresponds to absorption of the excited states. The smaller cross peaks arise due to coupling between the two states. The linear absorption spectrum is indicated above the 2DIR spectrum. The two peaks here reveal no information on coupling between the two states.]]

After the waiting time in the experiment it is possible to reach doubly excited states. This results in the appearance of an overtone peak. The [[anharmonicity]] of a vibration can be read from the spectra as the distance between the diagonal peak and the overtone peak. One obvious advantage of 2DIR spectra over
normal linear absorption spectra is that they reveal the coupling between different states. This for example allows for the determination of the angle between the involved transition dipoles.

The true power of 2DIR spectroscopy is that it allows following dynamical processes as [[chemical exchange]], vibrational population transfer, and molecular reorientation on the sub-picosecond time scale. It has successfully been used to study [[hydrogen bond]] forming and breaking and to determine the [[transition state]] geometry of a structural rearrangement in an iron carbonyl compound.

'''Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy''' or '''ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry''' ('''UV/&amp;nbsp;VIS''') involves the [[spectroscopy]] of [[photon]]s and [[spectrophotometry]]. It uses light in the visible and adjacent near [[ultraviolet]] (UV) and near [[infrared]] (NIR) ranges. In this region of energy space [[molecule]]s undergo [[Molecular electronic transition|electronic transitions]].

==Applications==
UV/Vis spectroscopy is routinely used in the [[quantitative analysis|quantitative]] determination of solutions of [[transition metal]] ions and highly [[Conjugated_system|conjugated]] [[organic compound]]s.
*Solutions of transition metal ions can be colored (i.e., absorb visible light) because [[electron configuration|d electrons]] within the metal atoms can be excited from one electronic state to another. The color of metal ion solutions is strongly affected by the presence of other species, such as certain anions or [[ligand]]s. For instance, the color of a dilute solution of [[copper sulphate]] is a very light blue; adding [[ammonia]] intensifies the color and changes the wavelength of maximum absorption (&lt;math&gt;\lambda\_max&lt;/math&gt;).
*[[Organic compound]]s, especially those with a high degree of [[conjugated system|conjugation]], also absorb light in the UV or visible regions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. The solvents for these determinations are often water for water soluble compounds, or [[ethanol]] for organic-soluble compounds. (Organic solvents may have significant UV absorption; not all solvents are suitable for use in UV spectroscopy. Ethanol absorbs very weakly at most wavelengths.)
*While [[charge transfer complexes]] also give rise to colors, the colors are often too intense to be used for quantitative measurement.

The [[Beer-Lambert law]] states that the absorbance of a solution is directly proportional to the solution's concentration. Thus UV/VIS spectroscopy can be used to determine the concentration of a solution. It is necessary to know how quickly the absorbance changes with concentration.  This can be taken from references (tables of [[molar extinction coefficients]]), or more accurately, determined from a [[calibration curve]].

A UV/Vis spectrophotometer may be used as a detector for [[HPLC]]. The presence of an analyte gives a response which can be assumed to be proportional to the concentration. For accurate results, the instrument's response to the analyte in the unknown should be compared with the response to a standard; this is very similar to the use of calibration curves. The response (e.g., peak height) for a particular concentration is known as the [[response factor]].

==Beer-Lambert law==
The method is most often used in a quantitative way to determine concentrations of an absorbing species in solution, using the Beer-Lambert law:

:&lt;math&gt;A =\ &lt;/math&gt; &amp;minus;&lt;math&gt;\log_{10}(I/I_0) = \epsilon\cdot c\cdot L&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''A'' is the measured [[absorbance]], &lt;math&gt;I_0&lt;/math&gt; is the intensity of the incident light at a given [[wavelength]], &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the transmitted intensity, ''L'' the pathlength through the sample, and ''c'' the [[concentration]] of the absorbing species. For each species and wavelength, &amp;epsilon; is a constant known as the [[molar absorptivity]] or [[extinction coefficient]]. This constant is a fundamental molecular property in a given solvent, at a particular temperature and pressure, and has units of &lt;math&gt;1/M*cm&lt;/math&gt; or often &lt;math&gt;AU/M*cm&lt;/math&gt;.

The absorbance  and extinction ''&amp;epsilon;'' are sometimes defined in terms of the [[natural logarithm]] instead of the base-10 logarithm.

The Beer-Lambert Law is useful for characterizing many compounds but does not hold as a universal relationship for the concentration and absorption of all substances. A 2nd order polynomial relationship between absorption and concentration is sometimes encountered for very large, complex molecules such as organic dyes ([[Xylenol orange|Xylenol Orange]] or [[Neutral red|Neutral Red]], for example).

==Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer==

The [[Measuring instrument|instrument]] used in ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy is called a UV/vis '''spectrophotometer'''.  It measures the intensity of light passing through a sample (&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;), and compares it to the intensity of light before it passes through the sample (&lt;math&gt;I_o&lt;/math&gt;).  The ratio &lt;math&gt;I/I_o&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''transmittance'', and is usually expressed as a percentage (%T). The [[absorbance]], &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, is based on the transmittance:
::&lt;math&gt;A=-log(%T)&lt;/math&gt;

The basic parts of a spectrophotometer are a light source (often an [[incandescent bulb]] for the visible wavelengths, or a [[deuterium arc lamp]] in the ultraviolet), a holder for the sample, a [[diffraction grating]] or [[monochromator]] to separate the different wavelengths of light, and a detector. The detector is typically a [[photodiode]] or a [[charge-coupled device|CCD]]. Photodiodes are used with monochromators, which filter the light so that only light of a single wavelength reaches the detector. Diffraction gratings are used with CCDs, which collects light of different wavelengths on different pixels.

[[Image:UV-vis.png|thumb|300px|Diagram of a single-beam UV/vis spectrophotometer.]]

A spectrophotometer can be either ''single beam'' or ''double beam''.  In a single beam instrument (such as the [[Spectronic 20]]), all of the light passes through the sample cell.  &lt;math&gt;I_o&lt;/math&gt; must be measured by removing the sample. This was the earliest design, but is still in common use in both teaching and industrial labs.

In a double-beam instrument, the light is split into two beams before it reaches the sample.  One beam is used as the reference; the other beam passes through the sample. Some double-beam instruments have two detectors (photodiodes), and the sample and reference beam are measured at the same time. In other instruments, the two beams pass through a [[optical chopper|beam chopper]], which blocks one beam at a time. The detector alternates between measuring the sample beam and the reference beam.

Samples for UV/Vis spectrophotometry are most often liquids, although the absorbance of gases and even of solids can also be measured. Samples are typically placed in a [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] cell, known as a '''cuvette'''.  Cuvettes are typically rectangular in shape, commonly with an internal width of 1 cm. (This width becomes the path length, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, in the Beer-Lambert law.) [[Test tube]]s can also be used as cuvettes in some instruments. The best cuvettes are made of high quality [[quartz]], although glass or plastic cuvettes are common. (Glass and most plastics absorb in the UV, which limits their usefulness to visible wavelengths.)

==Ultraviolet-visible spectrum==

An ultraviolet-visible spectrum is essentially a [[Graph of a function|graph]] of light absorbance versus wavelength in a range of ultraviolet or visible regions.  Such a spectrum can often be produced by a more sophisticated spectrophotometer. Wavelength is often represented by the symbol &amp;lambda;.  Similarly, for a given substance, a standard graph of extinction coefficient &amp;epsilon;  vs. wavelength &amp;lambda; may be made or used if one is already available.  Such a standard graph would be effectively &quot;concentration-corrected&quot; and thus independent of concentration.  For the given substance, the wavelength at which maximum absorption in the spectrum occurs is called '''&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;''', pronounced &quot;Lambda-max&quot;.

Woodward-Fieser rules are a set of empirical observations which can be used to predict λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, the wavelength of the most intense UV/Vis absorption, for conjugated organic compounds such as [[diene]]s and [[ketone]]s.

'''Unimolecular ion decomposition''' is the fragmentation of a gas phase ion in a reaction with a [[molecularity]] of one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.pc.30.100179.000411 | title = Unimolecular Ion Decomposition | year = 1979 | last1 = Brenton | first1 = A G | last2 = Morgan | first2 = R P | last3 = Beynon | first3 = J H | journal = Annual Review of Physical Chemistry | volume = 30 | pages = 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ions with sufficient [[internal energy]] may fragment in a [[mass spectrometer]], which in some cases may degrade the mass spectrometer performance, but in other cases, such as [[tandem mass spectrometry]], the fragmentation can reveal information about the structure of the ion. 

==Wahrhaftig diagram==
[[File:Wahrhaftig Diagram.gif|thumb|right|400 px|Wahrhaftig diagram showing the relationship between internal energy and unimolecular ion decomposition for a hypothetical ion ABCD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.]]
A Wahrhaftig diagram illustrates the relative contributions in unimolecular ion decomposition of direct fragmentation and fragmentation following rearrangement. The [[x-axis]] of the digram represents the internal energy of the ion. The lower part of the diagram shows the [[logarithm]] of the [[rate constant]] ''k'' for [[unimolecular]] dissociation] whereas the upper portion of the diagram indicates the probability of forming a particular product ion. The green trace in the lower part of the diagram indicates the rate of the rearrangement reacton given by

:&lt;math&gt;ABCD^+  \to AD^+  + BC\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the blue trace indicates the direct cleavage reaction

:&lt;math&gt;ABCD^+  \to AB^+ + CD\,&lt;/math&gt;

A rate constant of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is sufficiently fast for ion decomposition within the [[ion source]] of a typical mass spectrometer. Ions with rate constants less than 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and greater than approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (lifetimes between 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; s) have a high probability of decomposing in the mass spectrometer between the ion source and the detector. These rate constants are indicated in the Wahrhaftig diagram by the log ''k'' = 5 and log ''k'' = 6 dashed lines.

Indicated on the rate constant plot are the reaction critical energy (also called the [[activation energy]]) for the formation of AD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(AD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and AB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(AB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). These represent the minimum internal energy of ABCD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; required to form the respective product ions:  the difference in the [[zero point energy]] of ABCD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and that of the [[activated complex]].

When the internal energy of ABCD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is greater than E&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;(AD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the ions are metastable (indicated by m&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;); this occurs near log ''k'' &gt; 5. A metastable ion has sufficient [[internal energy]] to dissociate prior to detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=metastable ion (in mass spectrometry)|file=M03874}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.68.54 | title = Detection of Metastable Ions with the Mass Spectrometer | year = 1945 | last1 = Hipple | first1 = J. | last2 = Condon | first2 = E. | journal = Physical Review | volume = 68 | pages = 54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(AD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is defined as the internal energy of ABCD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; that results in an equal probability that ABCD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;and AD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; leave the ion source, which occurs at near log ''k'' = 6. When the precursor ion has an internal energy equal to E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(AB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the rates of formation of AD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and AB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are equal.

==Thermodynamic and kinetic effects==
[[File:ABCD_transition_states.png|thumb|right|400 px|Schematic of &quot;tight&quot; and &quot;loose&quot; transition state complexes for a hypothetical ion ABCD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.]]
Like all chemical reactions, the unimolecular decomposition of ions is subject to [[thermodynamic versus kinetic reaction control]]:  the kinetic product forms faster, whereas the thermodynamic product is more stable. In the decomposition of  ABCD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the reaction to form  AD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is thermodynamically favored and the reaction to form  AB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;is kinetically favored. This is because the AD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reaction has favorable [[enthalpy]] and the AB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; has favorable [[entropy]].

In the reaction depicted schematically in the figure, the rearrangement reaction forms a double bond B=C and a new single bond A-D, which offsets the cleavage of the A-B and C-D bonds. The formation of AB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; requires bond cleavage without the offsetting bond formation. However, the [[steric effect]] makes it more difficult for the molecule to achieve the rearrangement transition state and form AD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The activated complex with strict steric requirements is referred to as a &quot;tight complex&quot; whereas the transition state without such requirements is called a &quot;loose complex.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Velocity selector.svg|thumb|right|300px|A velocity selector]]
A '''velocity selector''' is used in accelerator mass spectrometry to select particles based on their speed.  The velocity selector is composed of orthogonal electric and magnetic fields, such that particles with the correct charge to mass ratio and speed will be unaffected, and other particles will be deflected.

==Theory==
Any charged particle in an electric field will feel a force proportional to the charge and field strength such that &lt;math&gt; \vec{F} = q \vec{E} &lt;/math&gt;, where F is force, q is charge, and E is electric field.  Similarly, any particle moving in a magnetic field will feel a force proportional to the velocity and charge of the particle.  The force felt by any particle is then equal to &lt;math&gt; \vec{F} = q \vec{v} \times \vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;, where F is force, q is the charge on the particle, v is the velocity of the particle, B is the strength of the magnetic field, and &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; is the cross product.  In the case of a velocity selector, the magnetic field is always at 90 degrees to the velocity and the force is simplified to &lt;math&gt;F = qvB&lt;/math&gt; in the direction described by the cross product.

Setting the two forces to equal magnitude in opposite directions it can be shown that &lt;math&gt; \frac{E}{B} = v&lt;/math&gt;.  Which means that any combination of electric (&lt;math&gt;\vec{E}&lt;/math&gt;) and magnetic (&lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;) fields will allow charged particles with only velocity &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; through.

'''Vertico-SMI''' is currently the fastest [[light microscope]] for the 3D analysis of complete cells in the [[nanometer]] range. 

[[File:GFP Superresolution Christoph Cremer.JPG|thumb|200px|GFP Superresolution Christoph Cremer.JPG]]

==Configuration ==

SMI stands for a special type of laser optical illumination (''Spatially Modulated Illumination'') and Vertico reflects the vertical arrangement of the microscope axis which renders possible the analysis of fixed [[Cell (biology)|cells]] but also of living cells with an optical resolution below 10 nanometers (1 nanometer = 1&amp;nbsp;nm = 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m).

==Basic Facts==

Vertico-SMI was developed by [[Christoph Cremer]], Professor of Applied Optics and Information Processing at [[Heidelberg University]] and is based on the combination of light optical techniques of localization microscopy (SPDM, ''Spectral Precision Distance Microscopy'') and structured illumination (SMI, ''Spatially Modulated Illumination''). A particularity of this technology compared with focusing techniques such as [[4Pi microscopy]], is the wide field exposures which allow entire cells to be depicted at the nano scale.  Such a 3D exposure of a whole cell with a typical object size of 20&amp;nbsp;µm × 20&amp;nbsp;µm require only 2 minutes.  Wide field exposures signify that the entire object is illuminated and detected simultaneously.

===Spatially Modulated Illumination (SMI)===

SMI microscopy is a light optical process of the so-called [[Point Spread Function]]-Engineering. These are processes which modify the Point Spread Function (PSF) of a [[microscope]] in a suitable manner to either increase the optical resolution, to maximize the precision of [[distance]] measurements of fluorescent objects that are small relative to the [[wavelength]] of the illuminating light, or to extract other structural parameters in the nanometer range.  

The SMI microscope currently being developed at the Kirchhoff Institute for Physics at Heidelberg University achieves this in the following manner: The illumination intensity within the object range is not uniform, unlike conventional wide field fluorescence microscopes, but is spatially modulated in a precise manner by the use of two opposing interfering laser beams along the axis.  The principle of the spatially-modulated wave field was developed in 1993 by Bailey et al.  The SMI microscopy approach used in the Heidelberg application moves the object in high-precision steps through the wave field, or the wave field itself is moved relative to the object by phase shift.  This results in an improved axial size and distance resolution.

===Spectral Precision Distance Microscopy (SPDM)===

SPDM (Spectral Precision Distance Microscopy) is a light optical process of [[fluorescence microscopy]] which allows position, distance and angle measurements on &quot;optically isolated&quot; particles (e.g. molecules) well below the theoretical [[limit of resolution]] for light microscopy.  &quot;Optically isolated&quot; means that at a given point in time, only a single particle/molecule within a region of a size determined by conventional optical resolution (typically approx. 200-250&amp;nbsp;nm [[diameter]]) is being registered.  This is possible when [[molecules]] within such a region all carry different spectral markers (e.g. different colors or other usable differences in the [[light emission]] of different particles).  

The structural resolution achievable using SPDM can be expressed in terms of the smallest measurable distance between two in their spatial position determined punctiform particle of different spectral characteristics (&quot;topological resolution“).  Modeling has shown that under suitable conditions regarding the precision of localization, particle density etc., the &quot;topological resolution&quot; corresponds to a &quot;[[space frequency]]&quot; which in terms of the classical definition is equivalent to a much improved optical resolution. 
 
SPDM is a localization microscopy which achieves an effective optical resolution several times better than the conventional optical resolution (approx. 200-250&amp;nbsp;nm), represented by the half-width of the main maximum of the effective point image function.  By applying suitable laser optical precision processes, position and distances significantly smaller than the half-width of the point spread function (conventionally 200-250&amp;nbsp;nm) can be measured with nanometer accuracy between targets with different spectral signatures.  An important area of application is genome research (study of the functional organization of the [[genome]]).  Another important area of use is research into the structure of membranes.

==Resolution==

The effective optical resolution of this optical nanoscope has reached the vicinity of 10&amp;nbsp;nm in 2D and 40&amp;nbsp;nm in 3D and is therefore substantially better than the physical limit of 200&amp;nbsp;nm predicted by Abbe‘s law. [[Ernst Abbe|Abbe]] postulated in 1873 the theoretical limit of resolution of optical microscopy &lt;ref&gt;Reymann J, Baddeley D, Gunkel M, Lemmer P, Stadter W, Jegou T, Rippe K, Cremer C, Birk U.: ''High-precision structural analysis of subnuclear complexes in fixed and live cells via spatially modulated illumination (SMI) microscopy''. in: ''Chromosome Research'' 2008;16(3):367–82. PMID 18461478 {{DOI|10.1007/s10577-008-1238-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
The 3D images using Vertico-SMI are made possible by the combination of SMI and SPDM, whereby first the SMI and then the SPDM process is applied.  The SMI process determines the center of particles and their spread in the direction of the microscope axis.  While the center of particles/molecules can be determined with a 1-2&amp;nbsp;nm precision, the spread around this point can be determined down to an axial diameter of approx. 30-40&amp;nbsp;nm.

Subsequently, the [[wikt:lateral|lateral]] position of the individual particles/molecules is determined using SPDM, achieving a precision of a few nanometers.  At present, SPDM achieves 16 frames/sec with an effective resolution of 10&amp;nbsp;nm in 2D (object plane); approximately 2000 such frames are combined with SMI data (currently ca. 10 sec acquisition time) to achieve a three dimensional image of highest resolution (effective optical 3D resolution ca. 40-50&amp;nbsp;nm).  With a faster [[camera]], one can expect even higher rates (up to several hundred frames/sec, currently under development).  Using suitable dyes, even higher effective optical 3D resolutions should be possible&lt;ref&gt;Lemmer P, Gunkel M, Baddeley D, Kaufmann R, Urich A, Weiland Y, Reymann J,  Müller P, Hausmann M, Cremer C: ''SPDM – Light Microscopy with Single Molecule Resolution at the Nanoscale''. In: Applied Physics B  2008; 93: 1–12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baddeley D, Batram C, Weiland Y, Cremer C, Birk UJ.: ''Nanostructure analysis using Spatially Modulated Illumination microscopy''. In: Nature Protocols 2007; 2: 2640–2646&lt;/ref&gt;

== GFP Superresolution &quot;Blinking Dyes&quot; instead of photo-switchable molecules ==

Only in the past two years have molecules been used in nanoscopic studies which emit the same spectral light frequency (but with different spectral signatures based on the flashing characteristics) but which can be switched on and off by means of light as is necessary for spectral precision distance microscopy.  By combining many thousands of images of the same cell, it was possible using laser optical precision measurements to record localization images with significantly improved optical resolution.  The application of these novel nanoscopy processes appeared until recently very difficult because it was assumed that only specially manufactured molecules could be switched on and off in a suitable manner by using light.  Professor [[Christoph Cremer]]’s team discovered in 2008 that this was also possible for many standard fluorescent dye like [[GFP]], Alexa dyes and fluorescein molecules, provided certain photo-physical conditions are present.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Gunkel, Fabian Erdel, Karsten Rippe, Paul Lemmer, Rainer Kaufmann, Christoph Hörmann, Roman Amberger and Christoph Cremer: ''Dual color localization microscopy of cellular nanostructures''. In: Biotechnology Journal, 2009, 4, 927-938. ISSN 1860-6768&lt;/ref&gt; 

The GFP gene has been introduced and expressed in many procaryotic and eucaryotic cells and the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Chemistry]] 2008 was awarded to [[Martin Chalfie]], [[Osamu Shimomura]], and [[Roger Y. Tsien]] for their discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein. The finding that these standard fluorescent molecules can be used extends the applicability of the SPMD method to numerous research fields in [[biophysics]], [[cell biology]] and [[medicine]].

'''Vibrational circular dichroism''' (VCD) is a [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] technique which detects differences in attenuation of left and right [[circular polarization|circularly polarized light]] passing through a sample. It is basically [[circular dichroism]] spectroscopy in the [[infrared]] and near infrared ranges&lt;ref&gt;http://planetphysics.org/?op=getobj;from=objects;id=410 Principles of IR and NIR Spectroscopy&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Because VCD is sensitive to the mutual orientation of distinct groups in a molecule, it provides three-dimensional structural information. Thus, it is a powerful technique as VCD spectra of enantiomers can be simulated using ''ab initio'' calculations, thereby allowing the identification of absolute configurations of small molecules in solution from VCD spectra. Among such quantum computations of VCD spectra resulting from the chiral properties of small organic molecules are those based on [[density functional theory]] (DFT) and [[gauge-invariant]] [[atomic orbitals]] (GIAO). As a simple example of the experimental results that were obtained by VCD are the spectral data obtained within the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) stretching region of 21 [[amino acid]]s in [[heavy water]] solutions. Measurements of vibrational optical activity (VOA) have thus numerous applications, not only for small molecules, but also for large and complex biopolymers such as muscle proteins ([[myosin]], for example) and [[DNA]].

==Theory of VCD==
While the fundamental quantity associated with the infrared absorption is the dipole strength, the differential absorption is proportional also to the rotational strength, a quantity which depends on both the electric and magnetic dipole transition moments. Sensitivity of the handedness of a molecule toward circularly polarized light results from the form of the rotational strength.

==VCD of nucleic acids==
VCD spectra of nucleotides, synthetic polynucleotides and several nucleic acids, including DNA, have been reported and assigned in terms of the type and number of helices present in A- , B-, and Z- DNA.

==VCD Instrumentation==
For biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids, the difference in absorbance between the levo- and dextro- configurations is five orders of magnitude smaller than the 
corresonding (unpolarized) absorbance. Therefore, VCD of biopolymers requires the use of very sensitive, specially built instrumentation as well as time-averaging over relatively long intervals of time even with such sensitive VCD spectrometers. 
Most CD instruments produce left- and right- circularly polarized light which is then either sine-wave or square-wave modulated, with subsequent phase-sensitive detection and lock-in amplification of the detected signal. In the case of FT-VCD,
a photo-elastic modulator (PEM) is employed in conjunction with an  FT-IR interferometer set-up. An example is that of a Bomem model MB-100 FT-IR interferometer equipped with additional polarizing optics/ accessories needed for recording VCD spectra.
A parallel beam emerges through a side port of the interferometer which passes first through a wire grid linear polarizer and then through an octagonal-shaped ZnSe crystal PEM which modulates the polarized beam at a fixed, lower frequency such as 37.5 kHz. A mechanically stressed crystal such as ZnSe exhibits [[birefringence]] when stressed by an adjacent piezoelectric transducer. The linear polarizer is positioned close to, and at 45 degrees, with respect to the ZnSe crystal axis. The polarized radiation focused onto the detector is doubly modulated, both by the PEM and by the interferometer setup. A very low noise detector, such as MCT (HgCdTe), is also selected for the VCD signal phase-sensitive detection. Quasi-complete commercial FT-VCD instruments are also available from a few manufacturers but these are quite expensive and also have to be still considered as being at the prototype stage. To prevent detector saturation an appropriate, long wave pass filter is placed before the very low noise MCT detector, which allows only radiation below 1750&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to reach the MCT detector; the latter however measures radiation only down to 750&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. FT-VCD spectra accumulation of the selected sample solution is then carried out, digitized and stored by an in-line computer. Published reviews that compare various VCD methods are also available.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Polarization Modulation Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy with Digital SignalProcessing: Comparison of Vibrational Circular Dichroism Methods.&quot; Jovencio Hilario, DavidDrapcho, Raul Curbelo, Timothy A.

==Raman optical activity (ROA)==
[[Raman optical activity|ROA]] is a technique complementary to VCD especially useful in the 50—1600&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; spectral region; it is considered as the technique of choice for determining optical activity for photon energies less than 600&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

A '''vibrational transition''' is an abrupt change in [[vibrational energy]] in [[quantum physics]]. Like all other properties of a quantum [[elementary particle|particle]], vibrational energy is [[quantization (physics)|quantized]], meaning it can only equal certain discrete values, which correspond to different [[energy]] states. When a particle loses a unit of vibrational energy, known as a [[phonon]], it is said to have transitioned to a lower vibrational energy state. Likewise, when a particle gains vibrational energy, a positive vibrational transition is said to have occurred.

Vibrational transitions are important in physics due to the unique [[spectral line]]s that result. Because there is a net gain or loss of energy during a transition, [[electromagnetic radiation]] of a particular [[frequency]] is sometimes absorbed or emitted. This forms [[spectral line]]s at that frequency which can be detected by way of a [[spectrometer]], such as in [[Fourier transform spectroscopy|FT-IR]] or [[Raman spectroscopy]].

Vibrational transitions are strongly related to [[photon]]-[[phonon]] coupling, a phenomenon that allows some [[laser]]s to be tunable, like the [[Ti-sapphire laser]].

In [[theoretical chemistry]], the '''vibronic coupling''' terms, (which are neglected within the [[Born&amp;ndash;Oppenheimer approximation]]), are proportional to the interaction between electronic and nuclear motions of molecules. The term &quot;vibronic&quot; originates from the concatenation of the terms &quot;vibrational&quot; and &quot;electronic&quot;. The word coupling denotes the idea that in a molecule, vibrational and electronic interactions are interrelated and influence each other.

Vibronic coupling is large in the case of two [[adiabatic]] [[potential energy surface]]s coming close to each other (that is, when the energy gap between them is of the order of magnitude of one oscillation quantum).  This usually happens in the neighbourhood of an [[avoided crossing]] of  [[potential energy surface]]s corresponding to distinct electronic states of the same spatial and spin symmetry.  However, vibronic coupling also exists at real crossings.  In this case the [[adiabatic process (quantum mechanics)|adiabatic]] or [[Born&amp;ndash;Oppenheimer approximation]] fails and non-adiabatic terms (the so-called vibronic coupling terms) have to be taken into account.  The vibronic coupling terms are usually difficult to evaluate.  This is because they are proportional to the first and second derivatives of the electronic wave function with respect to the [[molecular geometry|molecular coordinates]].  A simpler way to solve this problem is to switch from the [[adiabatic process (quantum mechanics)|adiabatic]] to the [[diabatic]] representation of the [[potential energy surface]]s.  The vibronic terms are responsible for example for surface hopping or the [[Berry phase]].  The [[Berry phase]] has been discovered by [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Longuet-Higgins]] in this context.  The vibronic coupling becomes infinite in the neighbourhood of a [[conical intersection]].  This singularity in the potential energy landscape is the origin of the [[Berry phase]].

Perhaps the earliest examples of the importance of vibronic coupling were found during the 1930s. In 1934 [[Renner&amp;ndash;Teller effect|Renner]] wrote about the vibronic coupling in an electronically excited Π-state in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Calculations of the lower [[excited state|excited levels]] of [[benzene]] by Sklar in 1937 (with the valence bond method) and later in 1938 by [[Maria Goeppert-Mayer|Goeppert-Mayer]] and Sklar (with the [[molecular orbital]] method) demonstrated a correspondence between the theoretical predictions and experimental results of the benzene [[spectroscopy|spectrum]]. The benzene spectrum was the first qualitative computation of the efficiencies of various vibrations at inducing intensity absorption. &lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Gad. &quot;Vibronic Coupling - The Interaction between the Electronic and Nuclear Motions&quot;, Academic Press, New York, 1984.

[[File:XASEdges.svg|thumb|Figure 1: Transitions that contribute to XAS edges]]
[[File:XASFig.jpg|thumb|Figure 2: Three regions of XAS data]]

'''X-ray [[absorption spectroscopy]]''' (XAS) is a widely-used technique for determining the local geometric and/or electronic structure of matter. The experiment is usually performed at [[synchrotron radiation]] sources, which provide intense and tunable [[X-ray]] beams. Samples can be in the gas-phase, solution, or condensed matter (i.e. solids).

XAS data are obtained by tuning the [[photon]] energy using a crystalline monochromator to a range where core electrons can be excited
(0.1-100 keV photon energy). The &quot;name&quot; of the edge depends upon the core electron which is excited: the [[principal quantum number]]s n=1, 2, and 3, correspond to the K-, L-, and M-edges, respectively. For instance, excitation of a 1s electron occurs at the [[Metal K-edge|K-edge]], while excitation of a 2p electron occurs at an [[Metal L-edge|L-edge]] (Figure 1). 

There are three main regions found on a spectra generated by XAS data (Figure 2). The dominant feature is called the &quot;rising edge&quot;, and is sometimes referred to as [[XANES]] (X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure) or [[NEXAFS]] (Near-edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure). The pre-edge region is at energies lower than the rising edge. The [[EXAFS]] (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) region is at energies above the rising edge, and corresponds to the scattering of the ejected [[photoelectron]] off neighboring atoms. The combination of [[XANES]] and [[EXAFS]] is referred to as [[XAFS]]. 

Since XAS is a type of [[absorption spectroscopy]], it follows the same quantum mechanical [[selection rules]]. The most intense features are due to electric-dipole allowed transitions (i.e. Δ l = ± 1) to unfilled orbitals. For example, the most intense features of a K-edge are due to 1s → np transitions, while the most intense features of the L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-edge are due to 2p → nd transitions.

XAS methodology can be broadly divided into four experimental categories that can give complementary results to each other: [[Metal K-edge]], [[metal L-edge]], [[ligand K-edge]], and [[EXAFS]].

== Applications ==

XAS is an experimental technique used in different scientific fields including [[Molecular physics|molecular]] and [[condensed matter physics]], [[materials science and engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[earth science]], and [[biology]]. In particular, its unique sensitivity to the local structure, as compared to [[x-ray diffraction]], have been exploited for studying:

* [[Amorphous solid]]s and [[liquid]] systems
* [[Solid solution]]s
* [[Doping (semiconductor)|Doping]] and [[ion implantation]] materials for [[electronics]]
* Local distortions of [[Crystal structure|crystal lattices]]
* [[Organometallic chemistry|Organometallic compounds]]
* [[Protein|Metalloproteins]]
* [[Cluster chemistry|Metal clusters]]
* [[Catalysis]]
* Vibrational dynamics
* [[Ion]]s in [[solution]]s
* Speciation of elements
* [[Liquid water]] and aqueous solutions

==History==

An informative account about the history of XAS and EXAFS (originally called Kossel's structures) is given in the paper &quot;A History of the X-ray Absorption Fine Structure} by R. Stumm von Bordwehr&quot;, Ann. Phys. Fr. vol. 14, 377-466 (1989) (author's name is C. Brouder).

[[Image:Zeolite-ZSM-5-3D-vdW.png|thumb|X-ray crystallography can locate every atom in a [[zeolite]], an [[aluminosilicate]] with many important applications, such as [[water purification]].]]

'''X-ray crystallography''' is a method of determining the arrangement of [[atom]]s within a [[crystal]], in which a beam of [[X-ray]]s strikes a crystal and [[Diffraction|diffracts]] into many specific directions. From the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams, a [[crystallography|crystallographer]] can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of [[electron]]s within the crystal. From this electron density, the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal can be determined, as well as their [[chemical bond]]s, their [[Entropy|disorder]] and various other information.

Since many materials can form crystals — such as [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], [[metal]]s, [[mineral]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, as well as various inorganic, organic and biological molecules — X-ray crystallography has been fundamental in the development of many scientific fields. In its first decades of use, this method determined the size of atoms, the lengths and types of chemical bonds, and the atomic-scale differences among various materials, especially minerals and [[alloy]]s. The method also revealed the structure and functioning of many biological molecules, including vitamins, drugs, proteins and nucleic acids such as [[DNA]]. X-ray crystallography is still the chief method for characterizing the atomic structure of new materials and in discerning materials that appear similar by other [[experiment]]s. X-ray [[crystal structure]]s can also account for unusual [[electronics|electronic]] or [[Deformation (engineering)#Elastic deformation|elastic]] properties of a material, shed light on chemical interactions and processes, or serve as the basis for [[drug design|designing pharmaceuticals against diseases]].

In an X-ray diffraction measurement, a [[crystal]] is mounted on a [[goniometer]] and gradually rotated while being bombarded with X-rays, producing a diffraction pattern of regularly spaced spots known as ''reflections''. The two-dimensional images taken at different rotations are converted into a three-dimensional model of the density of electrons within the crystal using the mathematical method of [[Fourier transform]]s, combined with chemical data known for the sample. Poor resolution (fuzziness) or even errors may result if the crystals are too small, or not uniform enough in their internal makeup.

X-ray crystallography is related to several other methods for determining atomic structures. Similar diffraction patterns can be produced by scattering electrons or [[neutron]]s, which are likewise interpreted as a Fourier transform. If single crystals of sufficient size cannot be obtained, various other X-ray methods can be applied to obtain less detailed information; such methods include [[fiber diffraction]], [[powder diffraction]] and [[small-angle X-ray scattering]] (SAXS). In all these methods, the scattering is [[elastic scattering|elastic]]; the scattered X-rays have the same [[wavelength]] as the incoming X-ray. By contrast, ''inelastic'' X-ray scattering methods are useful in studying excitations of the sample, rather than the distribution of its atoms.

==History==
===Early scientific history of crystals and X-rays===
[[Image:Kepler conjecture 1.jpg|thumb|Drawing of square (Figure A, above) and hexagonal (Figure B, below) packing from [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler's]] work, ''Strena seu de Nive Sexangula''.]]
Crystals have long been admired for their regularity and symmetry, but they were not investigated scientifically until the 17th century. [[Johannes Kepler]] hypothesized in his work ''Strena seu de Nive Sexangula'' (1611) that the hexagonal symmetry of [[snow|snowflake crystals]] was due to a regular packing of spherical water particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kepler J|authorlink=Johannes Kepler|year=1611|title=Strena seu de Nive Sexangula|publisher=G. Tampach|location=Frankfurt|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/kepler/strena.html|isbn=3321000210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Snowflake8.png|thumb|left|As shown by X-ray crystallography, the hexagonal symmetry of snowflakes results from the [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] arrangement of [[hydrogen bond]]s about each water molecule. The water molecules are arranged similarly to the [[silicon]] atoms in the [[tridymite]] [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]] of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The resulting crystal structure has hexagonal symmetry when viewed along a principal axis.]]

Crystal symmetry was first investigated experimentally by [[Nicolas Steno]] (1669), who showed that the angles between the faces are the same in every exemplar of a particular type of crystal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steno N|authorlink=Nicolas Steno|year=1669|title=De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus|publisher=Florentiae}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[René Just Haüy]] (1784), who discovered that every face of a crystal can be described by simple stacking patterns of blocks of the same shape and size. Hence, [[William Hallowes Miller]] in 1839 was able to give each face a unique label of three small integers, the [[Miller index|Miller indices]] which are still used today for identifying crystal faces. Haüy's study led to the correct idea that crystals are a regular three-dimensional array (a [[Bravais lattice]]) of atoms and [[molecule]]s; a single [[unit cell]] is repeated indefinitely along three principal directions that are not necessarily perpendicular. In the 19th century, a complete catalog of the possible symmetries of a crystal was worked out by [[Johann Hessel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hessel JFC|year=1831|title=Kristallometrie oder Kristallonomie und Kristallographie|publisher=Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Auguste Bravais]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bravais A|authorlink=Auguste Bravais|year=1850|title=Mémoire sur les systèmes formés par des points distribués regulièrement sur un plan ou dans l'espace|journal=J.

From the available data and physical reasoning, Barlow proposed several crystal structures in the 1880s that were validated later by X-ray crystallography;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barlow W|year = 1883|title=Probable nature of the internal symmetry of crystals|journal=Nature|volume=29|page=186|doi=10.1038/029186a0}} See also Barlow W, ''Nature'', '''29''', 205, 383, 404 (1883-1884).&lt;/ref&gt; however, the available data were too scarce in the 1880s to accept his models as conclusive.

[[Image:3D model hydrogen bonds in water.jpg|thumb|X-ray crystallography shows the arrangement of water molecules in ice, revealing the hydrogen bonds that hold the solid together. Few other methods can determine the structure of matter with such sub-atomic precision (''resolution'').]]

X-rays were discovered by [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]] in 1895, just as the studies of crystal symmetry were being concluded. Physicists were initially uncertain of the nature of X-rays, although it was soon suspected (correctly) that they were waves of [[electromagnetic radiation]], in other words, another form of [[light]]. At that time, the wave model of [[light]] — specifically, the [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] theory of [[electromagnetic radiation]] — was well accepted among scientists, and experiments by [[Charles Glover Barkla]] showed that X-rays exhibited phenomena associated with electromagnetic waves, including transverse [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and [[spectral line]]s akin to those observed in the visible wavelengths. Single-slit experiments in the laboratory of [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] suggested the [[wavelength]] of X-rays was about 1 [[Angström]]. However, X-rays are composed of [[photon]]s, and thus are not only waves of electromagnetic radiation but also exhibit particle-like properties. The photon concept was introduced by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Einstein A|authorlink=Albert Einstein|year=1905|title=Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt (trans.

Mag.|volume=23|page=647}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Bragg's view was not broadly accepted and the observation of [[X-ray diffraction]] in 1912&lt;ref name=L1912 /&gt; confirmed for most scientists that X-rays were a form of electromagnetic radiation.

===X-ray analysis of crystals===
[[File:Bragg diffraction 2.svg|thumb|220px|left|The incoming beam (coming from upper left) causes each scatterer to re-radiate a small portion of its intensity as a spherical wave. If scatterers are arranged symmetrically with a separation ''d'', these spherical waves will be in synch (add constructively) only in directions where their path-length difference 2''d'' sin θ equals an integer multiple of the [[wavelength]] λ. In that case, part of the incoming beam is deflected by an angle 2θ, producing a ''reflection'' spot in the [[diffraction pattern]].]]

Crystals are regular arrays of atoms, and X-rays can be considered waves of electromagnetic radiation. Atoms scatter X-ray waves, primarily through the atoms' electrons. Just as an ocean wave striking a lighthouse produces secondary circular waves emanating from the lighthouse, so an X-ray striking an electron produces secondary spherical waves emanating from the electron. This phenomenon is known as [[elastic scattering]], and the electron (or lighthouse) is known as the ''scatterer''. A regular array of scatterers produces a regular array of spherical waves. Although these waves cancel one another out in most directions through [[destructive interference]], they add constructively in a few specific directions, determined by [[Bragg's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;2d \sin \theta = n \lambda\!&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''d'' is the spacing between diffracting planes, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the incident angle, ''n'' is any integer, and λ is the wavelength of the beam. These specific directions appear as spots on the [[diffraction pattern]] called ''reflections''. Thus, [[X-ray diffraction]] results from an electromagnetic wave (the X-ray) impinging on a regular array of scatterers (the repeating arrangement of atoms within the crystal).

X-rays are used to produce the diffraction pattern because their wavelength λ is typically the same order of magnitude (1-100 [[Ångström]]s) as the spacing ''d'' between planes in the crystal. In principle, any wave impinging on a regular array of scatterers produces [[diffraction]], as predicted first by [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]] in 1665. To produce significant diffraction, the spacing between the scatterers and the wavelength of the impinging wave should be similar in size. For illustration, the diffraction of sunlight through a bird's feather was first reported by [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] in the later 17th century. The first artificial [[diffraction grating]]s for visible light were constructed by [[David Rittenhouse]] in 1787, and [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] in 1821. However, visible light has too long a wavelength (typically, 5500 Ångströms) to observe diffraction from crystals. Prior to the first X-ray diffraction experiments, the spacings between lattice planes in a crystal were not known with certainty.

The idea that crystals could be used as a [[diffraction grating]] for [[X-ray]]s arose in 1912 in a conversation between [[Paul Peter Ewald]] and [[Max von Laue]] in the [[Englischer Garten|English Garden]] in [[Munich]]. Ewald had proposed a resonator model of crystals for his thesis, but this model could not be validated using [[visible light]], since the wavelength was much larger than the spacing between the resonators. Von Laue realized that electromagnetic radiation of a shorter wavelength was needed to observe such small spacings, and suggested that X-rays might have a wavelength comparable to the unit-cell spacing in crystals. Von Laue worked with two technicians, Walter Friedrich and his assistant Paul Knipping, to shine a beam of X-rays through a [[Copper(II) sulfate|copper sulfate]] crystal and record its diffraction on a [[photographic plate]]. After being developed, the plate showed a large number of well-defined spots arranged in a pattern of intersecting circles around the spot produced by the central beam.&lt;ref name=L1912 &gt;{{cite journal|author=Friedrich W, Knipping P, von Laue M|year=1912|title=Interferenz-Erscheinungen bei Röntgenstrahlen|journal=Sitzungsberichte der Mathematisch-Physikalischen Classe der Königlich-Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu München|volume=1912|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Concerning the detection of x-ray interferences|journal=Nobel Lectures, Physics|year=1914|author=von Laue M|volume=1901-1921|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1914/laue-lecture.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Laue developed a law that connects the scattering angles and the size and orientation of the unit-cell spacings in the crystal, for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dana ES, Ford WE|year=1932|title=A Textbook of Mineralogy, fourth edition|location=New York|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in the [[#Diffraction theory|mathematical derivation below]], the X-ray scattering is determined by the density of electrons within the crystal. Since the energy of an X-ray is much greater than that of a valence electron, the scattering may be modeled as [[Thomson scattering]], the interaction of an electromagnetic ray with a free electron. This model is generally adopted to describe the polarization of the scattered radiation. The intensity of Thomson scattering declines as 1/''m''² with the [[mass]] ''m'' of the charged particle that is scattering the radiation; hence, the atomic nuclei, which are thousands of times heavier than an electron, contribute negligibly to the scattered X-rays.

===Development from 1912 to 1920===
[[Image:Diamond and graphite2.jpg|thumb|Although [[diamond]]s (top left) and [[graphite]] (top right) are identical in chemical composition — being both pure [[carbon]] — X-ray crystallography revealed the arrangement of their atoms (bottom) accounts for their different properties. In diamond, the carbon atoms are arranged [[diamond cubic|tetrahedrally]] and held together by single [[covalent bond]]s, making it strong in all directions. By contrast, graphite is composed of stacked sheets. Within the sheet, the bonding is covalent and has hexagonal symmetry, but there are no covalent bonds between the sheets, making graphite easy to cleave into flakes.]]
After Von Laue's pioneering research, the field developed rapidly, most notably by physicists [[William Lawrence Bragg]] and his father [[William Henry Bragg]]. In 1912-1913, the younger Bragg developed [[Bragg's law]], which connects the observed scattering with reflections from evenly spaced planes within the crystal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bragg WL|year = 1912|title=The Specular Reflexion of X-rays|journal=Nature|volume=90|page=410|doi=10.1038/090410b0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bragg WL|year = 1913|title=The Diffraction of Short Electromagnetic Waves by a Crystal|journal=Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society|volume=17|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bragg|year = 1914|title=Die Reflexion der Röntgenstrahlen|journal=Jahrbuch der Radioaktivität und Elektronik|volume=11|page=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest structures were generally simple and marked by one-dimensional symmetry. However, as computational and experimental methods improved over the next decades, it became feasible to deduce reliable atomic positions for more complicated two- and three-dimensional arrangements of atoms in the unit-cell.

The potential of X-ray crystallography for determining the structure of molecules and minerals — then only known vaguely from chemical and hydrodynamic experiments — was realized immediately. The earliest structures were simple inorganic crystals and minerals, but even these revealed fundamental laws of physics and chemistry. The first atomic-resolution structure to be &quot;solved&quot; (i.e. determined) in 1914 was that of [[sodium chloride|table salt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bragg|year=1913|title=The Structure of Some Crystals as Indicated by their Diffraction of X-rays|journal=Proc.

==Contributions to chemistry and material science==
X-ray crystallography has led to a better understanding of [[chemical bond]]s and [[noncovalent bonding|non-covalent interactions]]. The initial studies revealed the typical radii of atoms, and confirmed many theoretical models of chemical bonding, such as the tetrahedral bonding of carbon in the diamond structure,&lt;ref name=dia /&gt; the octahedral bonding of metals observed in ammonium hexachloroplatinate (IV),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wyckoff RWG, Posnjak E|year = 1921|title=The Crystal Structure of Ammonium Chloroplatinate|journal=J.

Also in the 1920s, [[Victor Moritz Goldschmidt]] and later [[Linus Pauling]] developed rules for eliminating chemically unlikely structures and for determining the relative sizes of atoms. These rules led to the structure of [[brookite]] (1928) and an understanding of the relative stability of the [[rutile]], [[brookite]] and [[anatase]] forms of [[titanium dioxide]].

The distance between two bonded atoms is a sensitive measure of the bond strength and its [[bond order]]; thus, X-ray crystallographic studies have led to the discovery of even more exotic types of bonding in [[inorganic chemistry]], such as metal-metal double bonds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Powell HM, Ewens RVG|year=1939|title=The crystal structure of iron enneacarbonyl|journal=J.

In material sciences, many complicated [[inorganic]] and [[organometallic]] systems have been analyzed using single-crystal methods, such as [[fullerene]]s, [[porphyrin|metalloporphyrins]], and other complicated compounds. Single-crystal diffraction is also used in the [[pharmaceutical industry]], due to recent problems with [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]]. The major factors affecting the quality of single-crystal structures are the crystal's size and regularity; [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]] is a commonly used technique to improve these factors in small-molecule crystals. The [[Cambridge Structural Database]] contains over 500,000 structures; over 99% of these structures were determined by X-ray diffraction.

===Mineralogy and metallurgy===
Since the 1920s, X-ray diffraction has been the principal method for determining the arrangement of atoms in minerals and [[metal]]s. The application of X-ray crystallography to [[mineralogy]] began with the structure of [[garnet]], which was determined in 1924 by Menzer. A systematic X-ray crystallographic study of the [[silicate]]s was undertaken in the 1920s. This study showed that, as the [[silicon|Si]]/[[oxygen|O]] ratio is altered, the silicate crystals exhibit significant changes in their atomic arrangements. Machatschki extended these insights to minerals in which [[aluminium]] substitutes for the [[silicon]] atoms of the silicates. The first application of X-ray crystallography to [[metallurgy]] likewise occurred in the mid-1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Westgren A, Phragmén G|year = 1925|title=X-ray Analysis of the Cu-Zn, Ag-Zn and Au-Zn Alloys|journal=Phil.

===Biological macromolecular crystallography===
Crystal structures of proteins (which are irregular and hundreds of times larger than cholesterol) began to be solved in the late 1950s, beginning with the structure of [[sperm whale]] [[myoglobin]] by [[Max Perutz]] and [[John Kendrew|Sir John Cowdery Kendrew]], for which they were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/181662a0|volume=181|page=662|author=Kendrew J.

==Relationship to other scattering techniques==
===Elastic vs. inelastic scattering===
X-ray crystallography is a form of [[elastic scattering]]; the outgoing X-rays have the same energy, and thus same wavelength, as the incoming X-rays, only with altered direction. By contrast, ''inelastic scattering'' occurs when energy is transferred from the incoming X-ray to the crystal, e.g., by exciting an inner-shell electron to a higher [[energy level]]. Such inelastic scattering reduces the energy (or increases the wavelength) of the outgoing beam. Inelastic scattering is useful for probing such excitations of matter, but not in determining the distribution of scatterers within the matter, which is the goal of X-ray crystallography.

[[X-ray]]s range in wavelength from 10 to 0.01 [[nanometers]]; a typical wavelength used for crystallography is 1&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström|Å]], which is on the scale of covalent [[chemical bond]]s and the radius of a single atom. Longer-wavelength photons (such as [[ultraviolet]] [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]]) would not have sufficient resolution to determine the atomic positions. At the other extreme, shorter-wavelength photons such as [[gamma ray]]s are difficult to produce in large numbers, difficult to focus, and interact too strongly with matter, producing [[pair production|particle-antiparticle pairs]]. Therefore, X-rays are the &quot;sweetspot&quot; for wavelength when determining atomic-resolution structures from the scattering of [[electromagnetic radiation]].

===Other X-ray techniques===
Other forms of elastic X-ray scattering include [[powder diffraction]], [[SAXS]] and several types of X-ray [[fiber diffraction]], which was used by [[Rosalind Franklin]] in determining the [[double helix|double-helix structure]] of [[DNA]]. In general, single-crystal X-ray diffraction offers more structural information than these other techniques; however, it requires a sufficiently large and regular crystal, which is not always available.

These scattering methods generally use ''monochromatic'' X-rays, which are restricted to a single wavelength with minor deviations. A broad spectrum of X-rays (that is, a blend of X-rays with different wavelengths) can also be used to carry out X-ray diffraction, a technique known as the Laue method. This is the method used in the original discovery of X-ray diffraction. Laue scattering provides much structural information with only a short exposure to the X-ray beam, and is therefore used in structural studies of very rapid events ([[Time resolved crystallography]]). However, it is not as well-suited as monochromatic scattering for determining the full atomic structure of a crystal and therefore works better with crystals with relatively simple atomic arrangements.

The Laue back reflection mode records X-rays scattered backwards from a broad spectrum source. This is useful if the sample is too thick for X-rays to transmit through it. The diffracting planes in the crystal are determined by knowing that the normal to the diffracting plane bisects the angle between the incident beam and the diffracted beam. A Greninger chart can be used &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Greninger AB|journal=Zeitschrift fur Kristallographie|volume=91|year=1935|page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; to interpret the back reflection Laue photograph.

===Electron and neutron diffraction===
Other particles, such as electrons and [[neutron]]s, may be used to produce a [[diffraction pattern]]. Although electron, neutron, and X-ray scattering use very different equipment, the resulting diffraction patterns are analyzed using the same [[coherent diffraction imaging]] techniques.

As derived below, the electron density within the crystal and the diffraction patterns are related by a simple mathematical method, the [[Fourier transform]], which allows the density to be calculated relatively easily from the patterns. However, this works only if the scattering is ''weak'', i.e., if the scattered beams are much less intense than the incoming beam. Weakly scattered beams pass through the remainder of the crystal without undergoing a second scattering event. Such re-scattered waves are called &quot;secondary scattering&quot; and hinder the analysis. Any sufficiently thick crystal will produce secondary scattering, but since X-rays interact relatively weakly with the electrons, this is generally not a significant concern. By contrast, electron beams may produce strong secondary scattering even for relatively thin crystals (&gt;100&amp;nbsp;nm). Since this thickness corresponds to the diameter of many [[virus]]es, a promising direction is the electron diffraction of isolated macromolecular assemblies, such as [[virus|viral]] [[capsid]]s and molecular machines, which may be carried out with a cryo-[[electron microscope]].

Neutron diffraction is an excellent method for structure determination, although it has been difficult to obtain intense, monochromatic beams of neutrons in sufficient quantities. Traditionally, [[nuclear reactor]]s have been used, although the new [[Spallation Neutron Source]] holds much promise in the near future. Being uncharged, neutrons scatter much more readily from the atomic nuclei rather than from the electrons. Therefore, neutron scattering is very useful for observing the positions of light atoms with few electrons, especially [[hydrogen]], which is essentially invisible in the X-ray diffraction. Neutron scattering also has the remarkable property that the solvent can be made invisible by adjusting the ratio of normal [[water]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and [[heavy water]], D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

==Methods==
===Overview of single-crystal X-ray diffraction===
[[Image:X ray diffraction.png|thumb|Workflow for solving the structure of a molecule by X-ray crystallography.]]
The oldest and most precise method of X-ray [[crystallography]] is ''single-crystal X-ray diffraction'', in which a beam of X-rays strikes a single crystal, producing scattered beams. When they land on a piece of film or other detector, these beams make a ''diffraction pattern'' of spots; the strengths and angles of these beams are recorded as the crystal is gradually rotated.&lt;ref&gt;An analogous diffraction pattern may be observed by shining a laser pointer on a [[compact disc]] or [[DVD]]; the periodic spacing of the CD tracks corresponds to the periodic arrangement of atoms in a crystal.&lt;/ref&gt; Each spot is called a ''reflection'', since it corresponds to the reflection of the X-rays from one set of evenly spaced planes within the crystal. For single crystals of sufficient purity and regularity, X-ray diffraction data can determine the mean chemical bond lengths and angles to within a few thousandths of an Ångström and to within a few tenths of a [[degree (angle)|degree]], respectively. The atoms in a crystal are not static, but oscillate about their mean positions, usually by less than a few tenths of an Ångström. X-ray crystallography allows measuring the size of these oscillations.

====Procedure====
The technique of single-crystal X-ray crystallography has three basic steps. The first — and often most difficult — step is to obtain an adequate crystal of the material under study. The crystal should be sufficiently large (typically larger than 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm in all dimensions), pure in composition and regular in structure, with no significant internal [[crystal defect|imperfections]] such as cracks or [[crystal twinning|twinning]]. 

In the second step, the crystal is placed in an intense beam of X-rays, usually of a single wavelength (''monochromatic X-rays''), producing the regular pattern of reflections. As the crystal is gradually rotated, previous reflections disappear and new ones appear; the intensity of every spot is recorded at every orientation of the crystal. Multiple data sets may have to be collected, with each set covering slightly more than half a full rotation of the crystal and typically containing tens of thousands of reflections.

In the third step, these data are combined computationally with complementary chemical information to produce and refine a model of the arrangement of atoms within the crystal. The final, refined model of the atomic arrangement — now called a ''[[crystal structure]]'' — is usually stored in a public database.

====Limitations====
As the crystal's repeating unit, its unit cell, becomes larger and more complex, the atomic-level picture provided by X-ray crystallography becomes less well-resolved (more &quot;fuzzy&quot;) for a given number of observed reflections. Two limiting cases of X-ray crystallography—&quot;small-molecule&quot; and &quot;macromolecular&quot; crystallography—are often discerned. ''Small-molecule crystallography'' typically involves crystals with fewer than 100 atoms in their [[crystal structure|asymmetric unit]]; such crystal structures are usually so well resolved that the atoms can be discerned as isolated &quot;blobs&quot; of electron density. By contrast, ''macromolecular crystallography'' often involves tens of thousands of atoms in the unit cell. Such crystal structures are generally less well-resolved (more &quot;smeared out&quot;); the atoms and chemical bonds appear as tubes of electron density, rather than as isolated atoms. In general, small molecules are also easier to crystallize than macromolecules; however, X-ray crystallography has proven possible even for [[virus]]es with hundreds of thousands of atoms.

===Crystallization===
[[Image:Protein crystal.jpg|thumb|left|A protein crystal seen under a [[microscope]]. Crystals used in X-ray crystallography may be smaller than a millimeter across.]]
Although crystallography can be used to characterize the disorder in an impure or irregular crystal, crystallography generally requires a pure crystal of high regularity to solve the structure of a complicated arrangement of atoms. Pure, regular crystals can sometimes be obtained from natural or synthetic materials, such as samples of [[metal]]s, minerals or other macroscopic materials. The regularity of such crystals can sometimes be improved with [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] and other methods. However, in many cases, obtaining a diffraction-quality crystal is the chief barrier to solving its atomic-resolution structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geerlof A ''et al.''|title=The impact of protein characterization in structural proteomics|journal=Acta Crystallogr. D|volume=62|page=1125|year=2006|pmid=17001090|doi=10.1107/S0907444906030307|issue=Pt 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small-molecule and macromolecular crystallography differ in the range of possible techniques used to produce diffraction-quality crystals. Small molecules generally have few degrees of conformational freedom, and may be crystallized by a wide range of methods, such as [[chemical vapor deposition]] and [[Recrystallization_(chemistry)#Single_perfect_crystals_.28for_X-ray_analysis.29|recrystallization]]. By contrast, macromolecules generally have many degrees of freedom and their crystallization must be carried out to maintain a stable structure. For example, proteins and larger [[RNA]] molecules cannot be crystallized if their tertiary structure has been [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|unfolded]]; therefore, the range of crystallization conditions is restricted to solution conditions in which such molecules remain folded.

[[Image:CrystalDrops.svg|thumb|upright|Three methods of preparing crystals, A: Hanging drop. B: Sitting drop. C: Microdialysis]] Protein crystals are almost always grown in solution. The most common approach is to lower the solubility of its component molecules very gradually; if this is done too quickly, the molecules will precipitate from solution, forming a useless dust or amorphous gel on the bottom of the container. Crystal growth in solution is characterized by two steps: ''nucleation'' of a microscopic crystallite (possibly having only 100 molecules), followed by ''growth'' of that crystallite, ideally to a diffraction-quality crystal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chernov AA|title=Protein crystals and their growth|journal=J. Struct. Biol.|volume=142|page=3|year=2003|pmid=12718915|doi=10.1016/S1047-8477(03)00034-0|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solution conditions that favor the first step (nucleation) are not always the same conditions that favor the second step (subsequent growth). The crystallographer's goal is to identify solution conditions that favor the development of a single, large crystal, since larger crystals offer improved resolution of the molecule. Consequently, the solution conditions should ''disfavor'' the first step (nucleation) but ''favor'' the second (growth), so that only one large crystal forms per droplet. If nucleation is favored too much, a shower of small crystallites will form in the droplet, rather than one large crystal; if favored too little, no crystal will form whatsoever.

It is extremely difficult to predict good conditions for nucleation or growth of well-ordered crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rupp B, Wang J|title=Predictive models for protein crystallization|journal=Methods|volume=34|page=390|year=2004|pmid=15325656|doi=10.1016/j.ymeth.2004.03.031|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, favorable conditions are identified by ''screening''; a very large batch of the molecules is prepared, and a wide variety of crystallization solutions are tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chayen NE|title=Methods for separating nucleation and growth in protein crystallization|journal=Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol.|volume=88|page=329|year=2005|pmid=15652248|doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2004.07.007|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds, even thousands, of solution conditions are generally tried before finding the successful one. The various conditions can use one or more physical mechanisms to lower the solubility of the molecule; for example, some may change the pH, some contain salts of the [[Hofmeister series]] or chemicals that lower the dielectric constant of the solution, and still others contain large polymers such as [[polyethylene glycol]] that drive the molecule out of solution by entropic effects. It is also common to try several temperatures for encouraging crystallization, or to gradually lower the temperature so that the solution becomes supersaturated. These methods require large amounts of the target molecule, as they use high concentration of the molecule(s) to be crystallized. Due to the difficulty in obtaining such large quantities ([[milligrams]]) of crystallization grade protein, robots have been developed that are capable of accurately dispensing crystallization trial drops that are in the order of 100 [[nanoliter]]s in volume. This means that 10-fold less protein is used per-experiment when compared to crystallization trials setup by hand (in the order of 1 [[microliter]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stock D, Perisic O, Lowe J|title=Robotic nanolitre protein crystallisation at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology.|journal=Prog Biophys Mol Biol|volume=88|page=311|year=2005|pmid=15652247|doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2004.07.009|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors are known to inhibit or mar crystallization. The growing crystals are generally held at a constant temperature and protected from shocks or vibrations that might disturb their crystallization. Impurities in the molecules or in the crystallization solutions are often inimical to crystallization. Conformational flexibility in the molecule also tends to make crystallization less likely, due to entropy. Ironically, molecules that tend to self-assemble into regular helices are often unwilling to assemble into crystals. Crystals can be marred by [[Crystal twinning|twinning]], which can occur when a unit cell can pack equally favorably in multiple orientations; although recent advances in computational methods may allow solving the structure of some twinned crystals. Having failed to crystallize a target molecule, a crystallographer may try again with a slightly modified version of the molecule; even small changes in molecular properties can lead to large differences in crystallization behavior.

===Data collection===
====Mounting the crystal====
[[Image:Kappa goniometer animation.ogg|thumb|left|Animation showing the five motions possible with a four-circle kappa goniometer. The rotations about each of the four angles φ, κ, ω and 2θ leave the crystal within the X-ray beam, but change the crystal orientation. The detector (red box) can be slid closer or further away from the crystal, allowing higher resolution data to be taken (if closer) or better discernment of the Bragg peaks (if further away).]]

The crystal is mounted for measurements so that it may be held in the X-ray beam and rotated. There are several methods of mounting. Although crystals were once loaded into glass capillaries with the crystallization solution (the [[mother liquor]]), a modern approach is to scoop the crystal up in a tiny loop, made of nylon or plastic and attached to a solid rod, that is then flash-frozen with [[liquid nitrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jeruzalmi D|title=First analysis of macromolecular crystals: biochemistry and x-ray diffraction|journal=Methods Mol. Biol.|volume=364|page=43|year=2006|pmid=17172760|doi=10.1385/1-59745-266-1:43}}&lt;/ref&gt; This freezing reduces the radiation damage of the X-rays, as well as the noise in the Bragg peaks due to thermal motion (the Debye-Waller effect). However, untreated crystals often crack if flash-frozen; therefore, they are generally pre-soaked in a cryoprotectant solution before freezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Helliwell JR|title=Protein crystal perfection and its application|journal=Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr.|volume=61|page=793|year=2005|pmid=15930642|doi=10.1107/S0907444905001368|issue=Pt 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, this pre-soak may itself cause the crystal to crack, ruining it for crystallography. Generally, successful cryo-conditions are identified by trial and error.

The capillary or loop is mounted on a [[goniometer]], which allows it to be positioned accurately within the X-ray beam and rotated. Since both the crystal and the beam are often very small, the crystal must be centered within the beam to within ~25 micrometers accuracy, which is aided by a camera focused on the crystal. The most common type of goniometer is the &quot;kappa goniometer&quot;, which offers three angles of rotation: the ω angle, which rotates about an axis perpendicular to the beam; the κ angle, about an axis at ~50° to the ω axis; and, finally, the φ angle about the loop/capillary axis. When the κ angle is zero, the ω and φ axes are aligned. The κ rotation allows for convenient mounting of the crystal, since the arm in which the crystal is mounted may be swung out towards the crystallographer. The oscillations carried out during data collection (mentioned below) involve the ω axis only. An older type of goniometer is the four-circle goniometer, and its relatives such as the six-circle goniometer.

====X-ray sources====
The mounted crystal is then irradiated with a beam of [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] X-rays. The brightest and most useful X-ray sources are [[synchrotron]]s; their much higher luminosity allows for better resolution. They also make it convenient to tune the wavelength of the radiation, which is useful for [[multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion]] (MAD) phasing, described below. Synchrotrons are generally national facilities, each with several dedicated [[beamline]]s where data is collected around the clock, seven days a week.

[[Image:X Ray Diffractometer.JPG|thumb|A diffractometer]]
Smaller, [[X-ray generator]]s are often used in laboratories to check the quality of crystals before bringing them to a synchrotron and sometimes to solve a crystal structure. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50&amp;nbsp;[[Volt|kV]]; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting ''[[bremsstrahlung]]'' and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of [[Atomic orbital|inner-shell electrons]] of the metal. The most common metal used is [[copper]], which can be kept cool easily, due to its high [[thermal conductivity]], and which produces strong K&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; lines. The K&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10&amp;nbsp;µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the [[Crookes tube]]) and produces ~2&amp;nbsp;[[Watt#Kilowatt|kW]] of X-ray radiation. The more expensive variety has a [[conventional X-ray generator|rotating-anode type source]] that produces ~14&amp;nbsp;[[Watt#Kilowatt|kW]] of X-ray radiation.

X-rays are generally filtered (by use of [[X-Ray Filters]]) to a single wavelength (made monochromatic) and [[collimator|collimated]] to a single direction before they are allowed to strike the crystal. The filtering not only simplifies the data analysis, but also removes radiation that degrades the crystal without contributing useful information. Collimation is done either with a collimator (basically, a long tube) or with a clever arrangement of gently curved mirrors. Mirror systems are preferred for small crystals (under 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm) or with large unit cells (over 150&amp;nbsp;Å)

====Recording the reflections====
[[Image:X-ray diffraction pattern 3clpro.jpg|thumb|An X-ray diffraction pattern of a crystallized enzyme. The pattern of spots (called ''reflections'') can be used to determine the structure of the enzyme.]]
When a crystal is mounted and exposed to an intense beam of X-rays, it scatters the X-rays into a pattern of spots or ''reflections'' that can be observed on a screen behind the crystal. A similar pattern may be seen by shining a [[laser pointer]] at a [[compact disc]]. The relative intensities of these spots provide the information to determine the arrangement of molecules within the crystal in atomic detail. The intensities of these reflections may be recorded with [[photographic film]], an area detector or with a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) image sensor. The peaks at small angles correspond to low-resolution data, whereas those at high angles represent high-resolution data; thus, an upper limit on the eventual resolution of the structure can be determined from the first few images. Some measures of diffraction quality can be determined at this point, such as the mosaicity of the crystal and its overall disorder, as observed in the peak widths. Some pathologies of the crystal that would render it unfit for solving the structure can also be diagnosed quickly at this point.

One image of spots is insufficient to reconstruct the whole crystal; it represents only a small slice of the full Fourier transform. To collect all the necessary information, the crystal must be rotated step-by-step through 180°, with an image recorded at every step; actually, slightly more than 180° is required to cover reciprocal space, due to the curvature of the [[Ewald sphere]]. However, if the crystal has a higher symmetry, a smaller angular range such as 90° or 45° may be recorded. The rotation axis should be changed at least once, to avoid developing a &quot;blind spot&quot; in reciprocal space close to the rotation axis. It is customary to rock the crystal slightly (by 0.5-2°) to catch a broader region of reciprocal space.

Multiple data sets may be necessary for certain phasing methods. For example, MAD phasing requires that the scattering be recorded at least three (and usually four, for redundancy) wavelengths of the incoming X-ray radiation. A single crystal may degrade too much during the collection of one data set, owing to radiation damage; in such cases, data sets on multiple crystals must be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ravelli RB, Garman EF|title=Radiation damage in macromolecular cryocrystallography|journal=Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol.|volume=16|page=624|year=2006|pmid=16938450|doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2006.08.001|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data analysis===
====Crystal symmetry, unit cell, and image scaling====
The recorded series of two-dimensional diffraction patterns, each corresponding to a different crystal orientation, is converted into a three-dimensional model of the electron density; the conversion uses the mathematical technique of Fourier transforms, which is explained [[#Diffraction theory|below]]. Each spot corresponds to a different type of variation in the electron density; the crystallographer must determine ''which'' variation corresponds to ''which'' spot (''indexing''), the relative strengths of the spots in different images (''merging and scaling'') and how the variations should be combined to yield the total electron density (''phasing'').

Data processing begins with ''indexing'' the reflections. This means identifying the dimensions of the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in reciprocal space. A byproduct of indexing is to determine the symmetry of the crystal, i.e., its ''[[space group]]''. Some space groups can be eliminated from the beginning. For example, reflection symmetries cannot be observed in chiral molecules; thus, only 65 space groups of 243 possible are allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral. Indexing is generally accomplished using an ''autoindexing'' routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Powell HR|title=The Rossmann Fourier autoindexing algorithm in MOSFLM.|journal=Acta Crystallogr. D|volume=55|page=1690|year=1999|pmid=10531518|doi=10.1107/S0907444999009506|issue=Pt 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having assigned symmetry, the data is then ''integrated''. This converts the hundreds of images containing the thousands of reflections into a single file, consisting of (at the very least) records of the [[Miller index]] of each reflection, and an intensity for each reflection (at this state the file often also includes error estimates and measures of partiality (what part of a given reflection was recorded on that image)).

A full data set may consist of hundreds of separate images taken at different orientations of the crystal. The first step is to merge and scale these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (''merging'') and to scale the relative images so that they have a consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry related [[R-factor (crystallography)|R-factor]] based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data.

====Initial phasing====
The data collected from a diffraction experiment is a [[reciprocal space]] representation of the crystal lattice. The position of each diffraction 'spot' is governed by the size and shape of the unit cell, and the inherent [[Unit cell|symmetry]] within the crystal. The intensity of each diffraction 'spot' is recorded, and this intensity is proportional to the square of the ''structure factor'' [[amplitude]]. The [[structure factor]] is a [[complex number]] containing information relating to both the [[amplitude]] and [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of a [[wave]]. In order to obtain an interpretable ''electron density map'', both amplitude and phase must be known (an electron density map allows a crystallographer to build a starting model of the molecule). The phase cannot be directly recorded during a diffraction experiment: this is known as the [[phase problem]]. Initial phase estimates can be obtained in a variety of ways:

*'''''[[Ab initio]]'' phasing''' or '''[[Direct methods (crystallography)|direct methods]]''' - This is usually the method of choice for small molecules (&lt;1000 non-hydrogen atoms), and has been used successfully to solve the phase problems for small proteins. If the resolution of the data is better than 1.4&amp;nbsp;Å (140&amp;nbsp;[[picometre|pm]]), [[Direct methods (crystallography)|direct methods]] can be used to obtain phase information, by exploiting known phase relationships between certain groups of reflections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hauptman H|title=Phasing methods for protein crystallography|journal=Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol.|volume=7|page=672|year=1997|pmid=9345626|doi=10.1016/S0959-440X(97)80077-2|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Usón I, Sheldrick GM|title=Advances in direct methods for protein crystallography|journal=Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol.|volume=9|page=643|year=1999|pmid=10508770|doi=10.1016/S0959-440X(99)00020-2|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Molecular replacement]]''' - if a related structure is known, it can be used as a search model in molecular replacement to determine the orientation and position of the molecules within the unit cell. The phases obtained this way can be used to generate ''electron density maps''.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite journal|author=Taylor G|title=The phase problem|journal=Acta Crystallogr. D|volume=59|page=1881|year=2003|doi=10.1107/S0907444903017815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Anomalous X-ray scattering]]''' (''[[Multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion|MAD]] or SAD phasing'') - the X-ray wavelength may be scanned past an absorption edge of an atom, which changes the scattering in a known way. By recording full sets of reflections at three different wavelengths (far below, far above and in the middle of the absorption edge) one can solve for the substructure of the anomalously diffracting atoms and thence the structure of the whole molecule. The most popular method of incorporating anomalous scattering atoms into proteins is to express the protein in a [[methionine]] auxotroph (a host incapable of synthesizing methionine) in a media rich in seleno-methionine, which contains [[selenium]] atoms. A MAD experiment can then be conducted around the absorption edge, which should then yield the position of any methionine residues within the protein, providing initial phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ealick SE|title=Advances in multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction crystallography|journal=Current opinion in chemical biology|volume=4|page=495|year=2000|pmid=11006535|doi=10.1016/S1367-5931(00)00122-8|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Heavy atom methods''' ([[multiple isomorphous replacement]]) - If electron-dense metal atoms can be introduced into the crystal, [[Direct methods (crystallography)|direct methods]] or [[Patterson function|Patterson-space methods]] can be used to determine their location and to obtain initial phases. Such heavy atoms can be introduced either by soaking the crystal in a heavy atom-containing solution, or by co-crystallization (growing the crystals in the presence of a heavy atom). As in MAD phasing, the changes in the scattering amplitudes can be interpreted to yield the phases. Although this is the original method by which protein crystal structures were solved, it has largely been superseded by MAD phasing with selenomethionine.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;

====Model building and phase refinement====
[[Image:eden.png|thumb|A [[protein]] crystal structure at 2.7&amp;nbsp;Å resolution. The mesh encloses the region in which the electron density exceeds a given threshold. The straight segments represent chemical bonds between the non-hydrogen atoms of an [[arginine]] (upper left), a [[tyrosine]] (lower left), a [[disulfide bond]] (upper right, in yellow), and some [[peptide|peptide groups]] (running left-right in the middle). The two curved green tubes represent [[spline (mathematics)|spline]] fits to the polypeptide backbone.]]

Having obtained initial phases, an initial model can be built. This model can be used to refine the phases, leading to an improved model, and so on. Given a model of some atomic positions, these positions and their respective [[Debye-Waller factor]]s (or '''B'''-factors, accounting for the thermal motion of the atom) can be refined to fit the observed diffraction data, ideally yielding a better set of phases. A new model can then be fit to the new electron density map and a further round of refinement is carried out. This continues until the correlation between the diffraction data and the model is maximized. The agreement is measured by an [[R-factor (crystallography)|''R''-factor]] defined as

:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{\sum_{\mathrm{all\ reflections}} \left|F_{o} - F_{c} \right|}{\sum_{\mathrm{all\ reflections}} \left|F_{o} \right|}&lt;/math&gt;

A similar quality criterion is ''R''&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt;, which is calculated from a subset (~10%) of reflections that were not included in the structure refinement. Both ''R'' factors depend on the resolution of the data. As a rule of thumb, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt; should be approximately the resolution in Ångströms divided by 10; thus, a data-set with 2&amp;nbsp;Å resolution should yield a final ''R''&lt;sub&gt;free&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 0.2. Chemical bonding features such as stereochemistry, hydrogen bonding and distribution of bond lengths and angles are complementary measures of the model quality. Phase bias is a serious problem in such iterative model building. ''Omit maps'' are a common technique used to check for this.{{Clarifyme|date=February 2009}}

It may not be possible to observe every atom of the crystallized molecule - it must be remembered that the resulting electron density is an average of all the molecules within the crystal. In some cases, there is too much residual disorder in those atoms, and the resulting electron density for atoms existing in many conformations is smeared to such an extent that it is no longer detectable in the electron density map. Weakly scattering atoms such as hydrogen are routinely invisible. It is also possible for a single atom to appear multiple times in an electron density map, e.g., if a protein sidechain has multiple (&lt;4) allowed conformations. In still other cases, the crystallographer may detect that the covalent structure deduced for the molecule was incorrect, or changed. For example, proteins may be cleaved or undergo post-translational modifications that were not detected prior to the crystallization.

===Deposition of the structure===
Once the model of a molecule's structure has been finalized, it is often deposited in a [[crystallographic database]] such as the [[Cambridge Structural Database]] (for small molecules) or the [[Protein Data Bank]] (for protein structures). Many structures obtained in private commercial ventures to crystallize medicinally relevant proteins, are not deposited in public crystallographic databases.

==Diffraction theory==
The main goal of X-ray crystallography is to determine the density of electrons ''f''('''r''') throughout the crystal, where '''r''' represents the three-dimensional position [[vector (geometry)|vector]] within the crystal. To do this, X-ray scattering is used to collect data about its Fourier transform ''F''('''q'''), which is inverted mathematically to obtain the density defined in real space, using the formula
:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{r}) = \int \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{\left(2\pi\right)^{3}} F(\mathbf{q}) e^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[integral]] is taken over all values of '''q'''. The three-dimensional real vector '''q''' represents a point in [[reciprocal space]], that is, to a particular oscillation in the electron density as one moves in the direction in which '''q''' points. The length of '''q''' corresponds to 2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; divided by the wavelength of the oscillation. The corresponding formula for a Fourier transform will be used below
:&lt;math&gt;F(\mathbf{q}) = \int d\mathbf{r} f(\mathbf{r}) e^{-i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
where the [[integral]] is summed over all possible values of the position vector '''r''' within the crystal.

The Fourier transform ''F''('''q''') is generally a [[complex number]], and therefore has a [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] |''F''('''q''')| and a [[Phase (waves)|phase]] ''φ''('''q''') related by the equation
:&lt;math&gt;F(\mathbf{q}) = \left|F(\mathbf{q}) \right|e^{i\phi(\mathbf{q})}&lt;/math&gt;
The intensities of the reflections observed in X-ray diffraction give us the magnitudes |''F''('''q''')| but not the phases ''φ''('''q'''). To obtain the phases, full sets of reflections are collected with known alterations to the scattering, either by modulating the wavelength past a certain absorption edge or by adding strongly scattering (i.e., electron-dense) metal atoms such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Combining the magnitudes and phases yields the full Fourier transform ''F''('''q'''), which may be inverted to obtain the electron density ''f''('''r''').

Crystals are often idealized as being ''perfectly'' periodic. In that ideal case, the atoms are positioned on a perfect lattice, the electron density is perfectly periodic, and the Fourier transform ''F''('''q''') is zero except when '''q''' belongs to the [[reciprocal lattice]] (the so-called ''Bragg peaks''). In reality, however, crystals are not perfectly periodic; atoms vibrate about their mean position, and there may be disorder of various types, such as mosaicity, dislocations, various point defects, and heterogeneity in the conformation of crystallized molecules. Therefore, the Bragg peaks have a finite width and there may be significant ''diffuse scattering'', a continuum of scattered X-rays that fall between the Bragg peaks.

===Intuitive understanding by Bragg's law===
An intuitive understanding of [[X-ray diffraction]] can be obtained from the [[Bragg diffraction|Bragg model of diffraction]]. In this model, a given reflection is associated with a set of evenly spaced sheets running through the crystal, usually passing through the centers of the atoms of the crystal lattice. The orientation of a particular set of sheets is identified by its [[Miller index|three Miller indices]] (''h'', ''k'', ''l''), and let their spacing be noted by ''d''. William Lawrence Bragg proposed a model in which the incoming X-rays are scattered specularly (mirror-like) from each plane; from that assumption, X-rays scattered from adjacent planes will combine constructively ([[constructive interference]]) when the angle θ between the plane and the X-ray results in a path-length difference that is an integer multiple ''n'' of the X-ray wavelength λ.
:&lt;math&gt;2 d\sin\theta = n\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt;
A reflection is said to be ''indexed'' when its Miller indices (or, more correctly, its [[reciprocal lattice]] vector components) have been identified from the known wavelength and the scattering angle 2θ. Such indexing gives the [[lattice parameter|unit-cell parameters]], the lengths and angles of the unit-cell, as well as its [[space group]]. Since [[Bragg's law]] does not interpret the relative intensities of the reflections, however, it is generally inadequate to solve for the arrangement of atoms within the unit-cell; for that, a Fourier transform method must be carried out.

===Scattering as a Fourier transform===
The incoming X-ray beam has a polarization and should be represented as a vector wave; however, for simplicity, let it be represented here as a scalar wave. We also ignore the complication of the time dependence of the wave and just focus on the wave's spatial dependence. Plane waves can be represented by a [[wave vector]] '''k'''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;, and so the strength of the incoming wave at time ''t=0'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;A e^{i\mathbf{k}_{in} \cdot \mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

At position '''r''' within the sample, let there be a density of scatterers ''f''('''r'''); these scatterers should produce a scattered spherical wave of amplitude proportional to the local amplitude of the incoming wave times the number of scatterers in a small volume ''dV'' about '''r'''
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{amplitude\ of\ scattered\ wave} = A e^{i\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}} S f(\mathbf{r}) dV&lt;/math&gt;
where ''S'' is the proportionality constant.

Let's consider the fraction of scattered waves that leave with an outgoing wave-vector of '''k'''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; and strike the screen at '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;screen&lt;/sub&gt;. Since no energy is lost (elastic, not inelastic scattering), the wavelengths are the same as are the magnitudes of the wave-vectors |'''k'''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;|=|'''k'''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;|. From the time that the photon is scattered at '''r''' until it is absorbed at '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;screen&lt;/sub&gt;, the photon undergoes a change in phase
:&lt;math&gt;e^{i \mathbf{k}_{out} \cdot \left( \mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{screen}} - \mathbf{r} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

The net radiation arriving at '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;screen&lt;/sub&gt; is the sum of all the scattered waves throughout the crystal
:&lt;math&gt;A S \int d\mathbf{r} f(\mathbf{r}) e^{i \mathbf{k}_{in} \cdot \mathbf{r}}
e^{i \mathbf{k}_{out} \cdot \left( \mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{screen}} - \mathbf{r} \right)} =
A S e^{i \mathbf{k}_{out} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{screen}}}
\int d\mathbf{r} f(\mathbf{r}) e^{i \left( \mathbf{k}_{in} - \mathbf{k}_{out} \right) \cdot \mathbf{r}} &lt;/math&gt;

which may be written as a Fourier transform
:&lt;math&gt;A S e^{i \mathbf{k}_{out} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{screen}}}
\int d\mathbf{r} f(\mathbf{r}) e^{-i \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{r}} =
A S e^{i \mathbf{k}_{out} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{screen}}} F(\mathbf{q})&lt;/math&gt;

where '''q''' = '''k'''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; - '''k'''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;. The measured intensity of the reflection will be square of this amplitude
:&lt;math&gt;A^{2} S^{2} \left|F(\mathbf{q}) \right|^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Friedel and Bijvoet mates===
For every reflection corresponding to a point '''q''' in the reciprocal space, there is another reflection of the same [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] at the opposite point -'''q'''. This opposite reflection is known as the ''Friedel mate'' of the original reflection. This symmetry results from the mathematical fact that the density of electrons ''f''('''r''') at a position '''r''' is always a [[real number]]. As noted above, ''f''('''r''') is the inverse transform of its Fourier transform ''F''('''q'''); however, such an inverse transform is a [[complex number]] in general. To ensure that ''f''('''r''') is real, the Fourier transform ''F''('''q''') must be such that the Friedel mates ''F''(−'''q''') and ''F''('''q''') are [[complex conjugate]]s of one another. Thus, ''F''(−'''q''') has the same magnitude as ''F''('''q''') but they have the opposite phase, i.e., ''φ''('''q''') = −''φ''('''q''')
:&lt;math&gt;F(-\mathbf{q}) = \left|F(-\mathbf{q}) \right|e^{i\phi(-\mathbf{q})} = F^{*}(\mathbf{q}) = \left|F(\mathbf{q}) \right|e^{-i\phi(\mathbf{q})} &lt;/math&gt;

The equality of their magnitudes ensures that the Friedel mates have the same intensity |''F''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This symmetry allows one to measure the full Fourier transform from only half the reciprocal space, e.g., by rotating the crystal slightly more than a 180°, instead of a full turn. In crystals with significant symmetry, even more reflections may have the same intensity (Bijvoet mates); in such cases, even less of the reciprocal space may need to be measured, e.g., slightly more than 90°.

The Friedel-mate constraint can be derived from the definition of the inverse Fourier transform
:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{r}) = \int \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{\left(2\pi\right)^{3}} F(\mathbf{q}) e^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}} =
\int \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{\left(2\pi\right)^{3}} \left|F(\mathbf{q}) \right|e^{i\phi(\mathbf{q})} e^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}} &lt;/math&gt;

Since [[Euler's formula]] states that ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''ix''&lt;/sup&gt; = cos(''x'') + ''i'' sin(''x''), the inverse Fourier transform can be separated into a sum of a purely real part and a purely imaginary part
:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{r}) =
\int \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{\left(2\pi\right)^{3}} \left|F(\mathbf{q}) \right|e^{i\left(\phi+\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}\right)} =
\int \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{\left(2\pi\right)^{3}} \left|F(\mathbf{q}) \right|
\cos\left(\phi+\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}\right) +
i \int \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{\left(2\pi\right)^{3}} \left|F(\mathbf{q}) \right|
\sin\left(\phi+\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}\right) = I_{\mathrm{cos}} + iI_{\mathrm{sin}}&lt;/math&gt;

The function ''f''('''r''') is real if and only if the second integral ''I''&lt;sub&gt;sin&lt;/sub&gt; is zero for all values of '''r'''. In turn, this is true if and only if the above constraint is satisfied
:&lt;math&gt;I_{\mathrm{sin}} = \int \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{\left(2\pi\right)^{3}} \left|F(\mathbf{q}) \right|\sin\left(\phi+\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}\right) =
\int \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{\left(2\pi\right)^{3}} \left|F(\mathbf{-q}) \right|
\sin\left(-\phi-\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}\right) = -I_{\mathrm{sin}}&lt;/math&gt;

since ''I''&lt;sub&gt;sin&lt;/sub&gt; = −''I''&lt;sub&gt;sin&lt;/sub&gt; implies that ''I''&lt;sub&gt;sin&lt;/sub&gt;=0.

===Ewald's sphere===
Each X-ray diffraction image represents only a slice, a spherical slice of reciprocal space, as may be seen by the Ewald sphere construction. Both '''k'''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; and '''k'''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; have the same length, due to the elastic scattering, since the wavelength has not changed. Therefore, they may be represented as two radial vectors in a sphere in [[reciprocal space]], which shows the values of '''q''' that are sampled in a given diffraction image. Since there is a slight spread in the incoming wavelengths of the incoming X-ray beam, the values of|''F''('''q''')|can be measured only for '''q''' vectors located between the two spheres corresponding to those radii. Therefore, to obtain a full set of Fourier transform data, it is necessary to rotate the crystal through slightly more than 180°, or sometimes less if sufficient symmetry is present. A full 360° rotation is not needed because of a symmetry intrinsic to the Fourier transforms of real functions (such as the electron density), but &quot;slightly more&quot; than 180° is needed to cover all of reciprocal space within a given resolution because of the curvature of the [[Ewald sphere]]. In practice, the crystal is rocked by a small amount (0.25-1°) to incorporate reflections near the boundaries of the spherical Ewald shells.

===Patterson function===
A well-known result of Fourier transforms is the [[autocorrelation]] theorem, which states that the autocorrelation ''c''('''r''') of a function ''f''('''r''')
:&lt;math&gt;c(\mathbf{r}) = \int d\mathbf{x} f(\mathbf{x}) f(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{r}) = \int \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{\left(2\pi\right)^{3}} C(\mathbf{q}) e^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

has a Fourier transform ''C''('''q''') that is the squared magnitude of ''F''('''q''')
:&lt;math&gt;C(\mathbf{q}) = \left|F(\mathbf{q}) \right|^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the autocorrelation function ''c''('''r''') of the electron density (also known as the ''Patterson function''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Patterson AL|authorlink=Arthur Lindo Patterson|year = 1935|title=A Direct Method for the Determination of the Components of Interatomic Distances in Crystals|journal=Zeitschrift für Kristallographie|volume=90|page=517}}&lt;/ref&gt;) can be computed directly from the reflection intensities, without computing the phases. In principle, this could be used to determine the crystal structure directly; however, it is difficult to realize in practice. The autocorrelation function corresponds to the distribution of [[vector (geometry)|vectors]] between atoms in the crystal; thus, a crystal of ''N'' atoms in its unit cell may have ''N(N-1)'' peaks in its Patterson function. Given the inevitable errors in measuring the intensities, and the mathematical difficulties of reconstructing atomic positions from the interatomic vectors, this technique is rarely used to solve structures, except for the simplest crystals.

===Advantages of a crystal===
In principle, an atomic structure could be determined from applying X-ray scattering to non-crystalline samples, even to a single molecule. However, crystals offer a much stronger signal due to their periodicity. A crystalline sample is by definition periodic; a crystal is composed of many [[unit cell]]s repeated indefinitely in three independent directions. Such periodic systems have a [[Fourier transform]] that is concentrated at periodically repeating points in reciprocal space known as ''Bragg peaks''; the Bragg peaks correspond to the reflection spots observed in the diffraction image. Since the amplitude at these reflections grows linearly with the number ''N'' of scatterers, the observed ''intensity'' of these spots should grow quadratically, like ''N''². In other words, using a crystal concentrates the weak scattering of the individual unit cells into a much more powerful, coherent reflection that can be observed above the noise. This is an example of [[constructive interference]].

In a liquid, powder or amorphous sample, molecules within that sample are in random orientations. Such samples have a continuous Fourier spectrum that uniformly spreads its amplitude thereby reducing the measured signal intensity, as is observed in [[Biological Small-Angle X-ray Scattering|SAXS]]. More importantly, the orientational information is lost. Although theoretically possible, it is experimentally difficult to obtain atomic-resolution structures of complicated, asymmetric molecules from such rotationally averaged data. An intermediate case is [[fiber diffraction]] in which the subunits are arranged periodically in at least one dimension.

An '''X-ray filter''' is a device to block or filter out some or all wavelengths in the [[X-ray]] spectrum.

X-ray filters are used to block low-energy X-rays during medical x-ray imaging. Low energy X-rays are more likely to be absorbed by the patient's soft tissues. This causes non-stochasic radioactive effects, and does not contribute to image quality.

X-ray filters are used in [[X-ray crystallography]], where crystalline lattice spacings can be determined using [[Bragg diffraction]]. The filters allow only a single X-ray wavelength to penetrate through to a target crystal, allowing the resulting scattering to determine the diffraction distance.

==Various elemental effects==

'''Results Using a Mo X-Ray generator:'''

[[Zirconium]] - Absorbs [[Bremsstrahlung]] &amp; [[K-Beta]]. &lt;br&gt;
[[Iron]] - Absorbs the entire spectra.&lt;br&gt;
[[Molybdenum]] - Absorbs Bremsstrahlung - Leaving K-Beta &amp; [[K-Alpha]]. &lt;br&gt;
[[Aluminium]] - 'Pinches' Bremsstrahlung* &amp; Removes 3rd Generation peaks.&lt;br&gt;
[[Silver]] - Same as Aluminium, But to greater extent. &lt;br&gt;
[[Indium]] - Same as Iron, But to lesser extent.&lt;br&gt;
[[Copper]] - Same as Aluminium, Leaving only 1st Generation Peaks.

* - Bremmstrahlung pinching is due to the atomic mass. The denser the atom, the higher the X-Ray Absorption. Only the higher energy X-Rays pass through the filter, appearing as if the bremmstrahlung continuum had been pinched.  
* - In this case, Mo appears to leave K-Alpha and K-Beta alone while absorbing the Bremsstrahlung. This is due to Mo absorbing all of the spectra's energy, but in doing so produces the same characteristic peaks as generated by the target.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Only Recreational? ===
*We definitely need more information on prohibited drugs, because what little info most people have is propaganda. However, is this book ''only'' concerned with recreational usage? What about spiritual, entheogenic usage? (Substances that are difficult, or impossible to use recreationally, such as salvia and DMT.) I think this is at least as important as the recreationally-used drugs. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] ([[User talk:PurplePieman|talk]]) 22:38, 19 June 2008 (UTC)

Please don't delete parts of this book, its not something that can be written in 10 minutes, give it some time to be filled out more. --[[User:Floydian|Floydian]] 16:31, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

== Appeal for personal experiences ==

I deleted the paragraph at the beginning that requested personal testimonials about drug experiences.  Wikibooks is not for original research, which this sort of appeal violates and as such we can't have it here.  If it is put back in, this may be grounds to delete this whole Wikibook.  Such testimonials will be deleted from other parts of this Wikibook under this standard as well.  If you want to discuss drug experiences between different drug users, please try Wikicities, or start your own web server for that sort of content.

I have defended the idea that this book could exist, and make sure that it becomes something worthy of a pre-med college textbook, not a drug user's handbook worthy of the uncyclopedia.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:46, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

:BTW, to add here, if you want to point to testimonials and other such stuff that has been put onto other websites as a ''reference'' and cite it here, that would be another issue altogether.  Legitimate scholarly research is acceptable, where you are citing other publications to prove a factual point.  We also don't want to be seen as encouraging people to partake of these very harmful substances.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:31, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

== I don't think you guys get the point of this book ==

Its not a book about drugs, straight up and out. Its a book that someone who is looking to try drugs should read so they DON'T end up killing themselves, but at the same time don't get discouraged by obvious lies that are published about them.

Fact of the matter is, unless '''you''' have tried drugs, you are trapped on the outside of a wealth of knowledge and an alternative view of our reality. You see someones quest for inner peace and knowledge as &quot;A druggie looking to get high&quot;.

The appeal for people to post experiences is there for people who have already had those experiences to describe them. Somebody who has experienced a drug has '''far''' more factual points on a drug than a medical journal that has conducted tests on rats or monkeys. Someone who has done ecstacy for 20 years can tell you how amzingly safe MDMA itself is. Someone who has tripped on acid since the 60's can tell you that acid is comparible to marijuana in safety. Someone who has snorted cocaine hundreds of times can tell you how a little self control is all it takes to avoid an addiction, and that you can surely feel it getting out of hand well before you have a heart attack.

Can medical journals that have studied rats tell you this? Can rats describe their symptoms of the euphoria? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:68.117.98.223|68.117.98.223]] ([[User talk:68.117.98.223|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/68.117.98.223|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

:No, but you are practicing amateur pharmacology when you participate in the consumption of controlled substances without any sort of scientific methodology or even throw caution to the wind and willy nilly partake of random substances.  Please, if you want to add content here, please look at [[WB:NPOV]] and find citable material which can be used to define what exactly happens when you consume these drugs.

:As for consuming mind altering drugs... I can say that yes, I have.  In every case under the supervision of a licensed medical practitioner.  I won't go into further details, and it was for specific medical procedures that would stand up to state medical board review.  I can't say that about what is advocated in this page.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:59, 2 July 2007 (UTC)

== Just as always and (nearly) everywhere ==

as i found this book i wondered how it could be that wikipedia, that is very often influenced by the current public opinion, has things like that on their list. i read and after a while i noticed the link that brought me here. i can just say that it is so sad and it really hurts me reading your argumentation. i cant speak in my own words without getting rude, because i got so frustrated over the years caused by people being mad about stuff about drugs they have read in a magazine. so i want to say it through 3 sayings:


1) If you have no concept of it at all: Just sh*t up from time to time! (german, dunno who; not meant discourteously)

2) Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. (Benjamin Franklin)

and after searching for half an hour for a exact translation i thought about the third &quot;why should i try to talk to those that wont listen anyway?&quot;, so
if you want to understand the last you will have to translate it yourself and proof me that you're listening.

3) Der Durchschnittsmensch gleicht einem eingepferchtem Tier, das noch nie bis zum Gatter vorgedrungen ist und daher völlig verständnislos die Berichte seiner Leidensgenossen hört, die von Begrenzung und Gefangennahme sprechen. Weil er noch nie weit genug gegangen ist, weiß er nicht, dass er im Käfig sitzt. (Baba Ram Dass)


a few words to me: early 20s, lot of experience with thc, specially after i nearly stopped touching ethanol when i was around 15/16 (3-4 times alcohol/year now); german (sorry for the spelling and grammar mistakes btw!). in my mind there are people who shouldn't take drugs or substances that could be seen as such, because they have latent mental problems or the natural tendency to get problems when getting in contact with drugs in common. The others wont need drugs to survive, too, yes, but this group simply splits into the ones who cannot talk about the topic and the ones who can. Sorry that this sounds so arrogant, but i am not able to say it in other words. i could write an essay here why the ones, who had no long term drug consumption or at least to people who get to manage to take drugs without messing everything up, can, but this isnt the place for such things. in short: every single, adult person having drug problems has no right to complain, because it is his/her own fault. and according to 3) nobody who has no drug experience should tell a one who has, what to do, say or think. if you would research a little bit, you will find out that Baba is some kind of mental leader of some weird club, but thats exactly what i want to say: Only because we have no idea what anyone is talking about we dont have the right to judge.

i understand that wiki... are public and have to hold up the law, thats ok and thats right. but in every other point where the law isnt broken every open minded person should let the others have as much freedom as possible. i dont get it in my head whats the problem with that idea... u dont have to read this book. If one person reads the section about life changing experiences and so on and thinks by itself &quot;thats a step to far for me&quot; and decides to take something less dangerous (i know how misplaced this word is, but you know what i mean: less risk) or nothing at all then you should be happy that this book exists. and the ones that would still want to try wont be held up by law or anything else if not by their own will, believe me. this is also the reason why im quiet shocked since i saw this site, because i thought wikipedia would be such a place of such people, where everyone does as he wants as long as nobody is hurt and when you show me the person that is hurt and didnt had the possibility to say no, then i might think about to argue seriously about that topic again.

at the end a saying about the third common usage of drugs despite fun and spiritual stuff, refers to alcohol but is true for all other drugs i think:

alcohol is a bridge, but no path (i know what ur thinking :-))

    greetings        LaVey

== Erroneous ==

Much of the information in this article is true. However, much is erroneous, and even more is left out, painting a rather unclear picture of the effects that drugs have on the body. While I find many of the points to be valid, it hardly seems like a full &quot;fact and fiction&quot;</text>

      <comment>added stop press note about proposed 'randseed' option</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This example is taken from [[w:Investment_theory|investment theory]], a branch of [[w:Financial_economics|financial economics]].  The aim is to achieve the best tradeoff between return and an investor's tolerance for risk when allocating capital among a set of potential investments with known historical performance.

== Summary ==

This tutorial example shows how to use GLPK/GMPL to [[w:Modern_portfolio_theory|optimize investment portfolios]] where investment risk is measured with the [[w:Mean_Absolute_Deviation#Mean_absolute_deviation|Mean Absolute Deviation]] (MAD) criterion. In addition to portfolio optimization, the example highlights techniques that may be useful in other GMPL applications, including 

* [[w:Cholesky_decomposition|Cholesky decomposition]] of [[w:Positive-definite_matrix|positive definite matrices]].
* Generating samples from a [[w:Multivariate_normal_distribution|multivariate Normal distribution]] for the simulation of historical returns.
*  Seeding GLPK's [[w:Random_number_generation|random number generator]] from GMPL. ''Note'': a new &lt;tt&gt;randseed&lt;/tt&gt; option is currently under evaluation.

Additional examples by the same author are available at [http://estm60203.blogspot.com/ Introduction to Operations Research].

== Portfolio Optimization for Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) ==

[[w:Modern_portfolio_theory|Portfolio optimization]] refers to the process of allocating capital among a set of financial assets to achieve a desired tradeoff between risk and return. The [[w:Modern_portfolio_theory|classical Markowitz approach]] to this problem measures risk using the expected variance of the portfolio return. This criterion yields a quadratic program for the relative weights of assets in the optimal portfolio. 

In 1991, Konno and Yamazaki &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Konno | first1 = Hiroshi | last2 = Yamazaki | first2 = Hiroaki | title = Mean-absolute deviation portfolio optimization model and its applications to Tokyo stock market | journal = Management Science | volume = 37 | pages = 519-531 | date = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a linear programming model for portfolio optimization whereby risk is measured by the mean absolute deviation (MAD) from the expected return.  Using MAD as the risk metric produces portfolios with several desirable properties not shared by the Markowitz portfolio, including [[w:Stochastic_dominance|second order stochastic dominance]].

As originally formulated by Konno and Yamazaki, one starts with a history of returns &lt;math&gt;R_i(t_n)&lt;/math&gt; for every asset in a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of assets. The return at time &lt;math&gt;t_n&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the change in price of the asset, &lt;math&gt;R_i(t_n)= {(P_i(t_n)-P_i(t_{n-1}))}/{P_i(t_{n-1})}&lt;/math&gt;. For each asset, the expected return is estimated by 

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\bar{R}_i \approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^NR_i(t_n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

The investor specifies a minimum required return &lt;math&gt;R_{p}&lt;/math&gt;.  The portfolio optimization problem is to determine the fraction of the total investment allocated to each asset, &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;,  that minimizes the mean absolution deviation from the mean

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\min_{w_i} \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N|\sum_{i \in S} w_i(R_i(t_n)-\bar{R}_i)|&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

subject to the required return and a fixed total investment:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcl}
\sum_{i \in S} w_i\bar{R}_i &amp; \geq &amp; R_{p}  \\
\quad \\
\sum_{i \in S} w_i &amp; = &amp; 1
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The value of the minimum required return, &lt;math&gt;R_p&lt;/math&gt; expresses the investor's [[w:Financial_risk|risk tolerance]]. A smaller value for &lt;math&gt;R_p&lt;/math&gt; increases the [[w:Feasible_region|feasible solution space]], resulting in portfolios with lower values of the MAD risk metric. Increasing &lt;math&gt;R_p&lt;/math&gt; results in portfolios with higher risk. The relationship between risk and return is a fundamental principle of investment theory. 

This formulation doesn't place individual bounds on the weights &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;w_i &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to [[w:Short_selling|short selling]] of the associated asset.  Constraints can be added if the investor imposes limits on short-selling, on the maximum amount that can be invested in a single asset, or other requirements for [[w:Diversification_(finance)|portfolio diversification]].  Depending on the set of available investment opportunities, additional constraints can lead to infeasible investment problems.

== Implementation Details ==

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate the modeling of portfolio optimization problems in GMPL.  The main tasks are to recast the mean absolute deviation objective in linear form, and to simulate historical returns given the mean and covariances for a set of potential investments.

=== Reformulation of the MAD Objective ===

The following formulation of the objective function is adapted from &quot;Optimization Methods in Finance&quot; by Gerald Curnuejols and Reha Tutuncu (2007) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Curnuejols | first1 = Gerald | last2 = Tutuncu | first2 = Reha | title = Optimization Methods in Finance | publisher = Cambridge University Press  | date = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, in turn, follows
Feinstein and Thapa (1993) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Feinstein | first1 = Charles D. | last2 = Thapa | first2 = Mukund N. | title = A Reformulation of a Mean-Absolute Deviation Portfolio Optimization Model | journal = Management Science | volume = 39 | pages = 1552-1553 | date = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The model is streamlined by introducing decision variables &lt;math&gt;y_n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n=1,\ldots,N&lt;/math&gt; so that the objective becomes

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt; \min_{w_i, y_n,z_n} \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n = 1}^{N} (y_n+z_n)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

subject to constraints

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcl}
\sum_{i \in S} w_i\bar{R}_i &amp; \geq &amp; R_{p} \\ \\
\sum_{i \in S} w_i &amp; = &amp; 1 \\ \\
y_n-z_n &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i \in S} w_i(R_i(t_n)-\bar{R}_i) \quad \mbox{for}\quad n = 1,\ldots,N
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

As discussed by Feinstein and Thapa, this version reduces the problem to &lt;math&gt;N+2&lt;/math&gt; constraints in &lt;math&gt; 2N+\mbox{card}(S) &lt;/math&gt; decision variables, noting the [[w:Cardinal_number|card]] function.

=== Seeding the GLPK Pseudo-Random Number Generator ===

Unfortunately, GMPL does not provide a method to [[w:Random_seed|seed]] the [[w:Random_number_generation|pseudo-random number generator]] in GLPK.  Instead, the following GMPL code fragment uses the function gmtime() to find the number of seconds since 1970. Dropping the leading digit avoids subsequent overflow errors, and the square returns a number with big changes every second.  Extracting the lowest digits produces a number between 0 and 100,000 that determines how many times to sample GLPK's pseudo-random number generator prior to subsequent use. This hack comes with no assurances regarding its statistical properties.

&lt;pre&gt;
 /* A workaround for the lack of a way to seed the PRNG in GMPL */
param utc := prod {1..2} (gmtime()-1000000000);
param seed := utc - 100000*floor(utc/100000);
check sum{1..seed} Uniform01() &gt; 0;
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Simulation of the Historical Returns ===

For this implementation, historical returns are simulated assuming knowledge of the means and covariances of asset returns. We begin with a vector of mean returns &lt;math&gt;\bar{R}&lt;/math&gt; and covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; estimated by
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\Sigma_{ij}   \approx  \frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{n=1}^N(R_i(t_n)-\bar{R}_i)(R_j(t_n)-\bar{R}_j)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Simulation of historical returns requires generation of samples from a multivariable normal distribution.  For this purpose  we  compute the [[w:Cholesky_decomposition|Cholesky factorization]] where, for a positive semi-definite &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma=CC^T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a lower triangular matrix.  The following GMPL code fragment implements the Cholesky-Crout algorithm.  

&lt;pre&gt;
/* Cholesky Lower Triangular Decomposition of the Covariance Matrix */
param C{i in S, j in S : i &gt;= j} :=
    if i = j then
        sqrt(Sigma[i,i]-(sum {k in S : k &lt; i} (C[i,k]*C[i,k])))
    else
        (Sigma[i,j]-sum{k in S : k &lt; j} C[i,k]*C[j,k])/C[j,j];
&lt;/pre&gt;

Without error checking, this code fragment fails unless &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite.  The covariance matrix is normally positive definite for real-world data, so this is generally not an issue.  However, it does become an issue if one attempts to include a risk-free asset, such as a government bond, in the set of investment assets.

Once the Cholesky factor &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; has been computed, a vector of simulated returns &lt;math&gt;R(t_n)&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;R(t_n) = \bar{R} + C Z(t_n)&lt;/math&gt; where the elements of &lt;math&gt;Z(t_n)&lt;/math&gt; are independent samples from a normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance.

&lt;pre&gt;
/* Simulated returns */
param N default 5000;
set T := 1..N;
param R{i in S, t in T} := Rbar[i] + sum {j in S : j &lt;= i} C[i,j]*Normal(0,1);
&lt;/pre&gt;

== PortfolioMAD.mod ==

Save this model as &lt;tt&gt;PortfolioMAD.mod&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Possible Extensions ==

There are number of extensions to this example that would make it more useful in real world settings:

* Add error checking for the Cholesky factorization.
* Add upper and lower (for example, no [[w:Short_selling|short selling]]) bound constraints on weighting coefficients.
* Add the ability to specify risk-free assets for the portfolio.
* Add constraints to impose diversification requirements.
* Add parametric analysis for the risk/return tradeoff (will require [[GLPK/Scripting_plus_MathProg|external scripting]])
* Develop a better means of seeding GLPK's random number generator from within GMPL.
* Add an [[GLPK/ODBC|ODBC]] database interface for empirical (rather than simulated) historical returns data.

Compile this source code into an executable named &quot;test_script.cgi&quot;.

== setup ==

Nearly all web servers support the Common Gateway Interface.
Here is some brief notes on how to put a CGI script written in C++ on an Apache server;
other web servers are similar.
For more details, see the [[Apache]] wikibook, section ... , or the analogous documentation for your favorite web server.

... security implications: user &quot;nobody&quot; ...

CGI scripts are used to deal with form data submission.
Here is an example HTML file that lets the user submit data to a &quot;test_script.cgi&quot; program.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!-- test_form.html --&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;form action=&quot;test_script.cgi&quot; method=&quot;get&quot;&gt;
   Favorite animal: &lt;input name=&quot;favorite_animal&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Put the compiled &quot;test_script.cgi&quot; in the appropriate &quot;cgi-bin&quot; directory.
Put the &quot;test_form.html&quot; in some convenient location -- typically some other directory on the same server, but it also works if it's on some other server or a file on your local machine.
Tweak the &quot;action&quot; property to give a path to the CGI script.

== testing ==

Fire up your favorite web browser, and point it at the &quot;test_form.html&quot;.
Click the submit button.
The output from the CGI script should be displayed.
Click the &quot;Valid&quot; link.

== static HTML ==

The above script always gives the same output -- if that's really what you want, then a simple static HTML page would give the same results for less effort:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;!-- static_hello.html --&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Hello&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, world!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer&quot;&gt;Good.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The power of CGI scripts is in doing things that are not possible with a static HTML page.

== getting input to the script ==

There are several libraries already available to handle the tricky bits of
splitting the CGI input into a list of name/val pairs.

* getcgivars.c from http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/cgi/getcgi.c.txt
* ... other CGI libraries in C and C++ ...


&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
/* cgi_hello.cpp
public domain
WARNING: untested code.
*/
...
int main(){
    send_CGI_header();
    send_contents();
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

A CGI script doesn't use the command-line arguments &quot;argc&quot; or argv&quot;.
Instead, it gets its input from environment variables -- and, in the case of HTTP PUT or HTTP POST, the program reads user-submitted data from the standard input.

Compile this source code into an executable named &quot;test_script.cgi&quot;.
Use the same test_form.html to test it.

== Overview ==

'''''Mr. Mason''''' is a potential customer of Grunnings, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon's]] company, who Vernon wishes to impress as part of getting him to purchase a large order of drills.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Mr. Mason and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mrs. Mason|his wife]] are representatives of a Muggle company who [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] hopes to snare as clients. In hopes of getting the largest order of drills he has ever received, Vernon coaches [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|his wife]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|son]] endlessly for their roles in softening the Masons into placing their order, with methods that are so hopelessly &quot;over the top&quot; that Harry is hard-put to stifle his laughter. Harry, of course, is banished to his room, and ordered to be quiet. The appearance of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]], a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house elf]], results in Harry making some noise which attracts the Mason's attention. Dobby, it seems, wants to prevent Harry from returning to Hogwarts, and in an attempt to force him to stay with the Dursleys, drops Petunia's dessert in the kitchen, before vanishing.

Vernon tries to comfort the Masons following this alarming incident; however, at that moment, an owl swoops in and drops a letter on Mrs. Mason's head. Because she is deathly afraid of birds, she runs from the house, followed by Mr. Mason, who announces as he leaves that he will not be dealing with Grunnings, he has never been so insulted in his life.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

== Analysis ==

Though the events surrounding the Masons — the introduction of Dobby, the warning from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], the subsequent locking of Harry into his room — are important to our plot, the Masons themselves are not particularly significant; we see little of them, we see almost nothing of their personalities, virtually any Muggle couple could serve here equally well. Their role seems to be to cast additional light on the character of Vernon Dursley, and to provide a reason that would justify his locking Harry up, something that would otherwise be seen as an overreaction by the reader, even given Vernon's character.

== Non free templates ==

I think we don't really need to have a bunch of non free templates. Our requirements are pretty straightforward regardless of what it is being used the criteria is the same. You can see what I did with {{tlx|non-free screenshot|an art piece}} to get an idea of how we could reduce them as well:

{{non-free screenshot|an art piece|example=yes}}

--&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:49, 1 July 2010 (UTC)
:The templates I'm importing provide additional information beyond the template above and can be conveniently selected when uploading via [[MediaWiki:Licenses]], without the uploader then having to fill in a parameter.  Additionally, the separate templates allow for detailed classification of material, rather than lumping it all into a single category.  Consider that if we manage to export all the free content to Commons, the ''only'' content we'll have will be non-free and categorizing it decently as soon as possible will save time later. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:54, 1 July 2010 (UTC)
::# The license option can fill in the parameter, so the uploader doesn't have to.
::# The category used can depend on the filled in parameter.
::--&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:58, 1 July 2010 (UTC)
:::That would break terribly if people tried to apply templates by hand and didn't match up the parameter with exactly what's desired.  If you want to use a switch for input, then the template becomes even more convoluted.  We already had non-free logo, Microsoft screenshot, and Adobe screenshot, so I'm only expanding on what we have.  And templates like [[Template:Non-free symbol]] have a custom image and information pertinent to the situation, like &quot;article 6ter&quot; of the Paris Convention. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:12, 1 July 2010 (UTC)
:::: I've thought for awhile that some merges would make since, but with so many templates being used it seem implausible until it was decided to move all free content to Wikimedia Commons.
:::: I think the types of non-free use work can be classified as photograph/visual, audio/sound recording, trademark, screenshot, and maybe government. Although trademark and government could both potentially be subtypes with &quot;{{para|trademark|yes}}&quot; and &quot;{{para|government|yes}}&quot; used. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:31, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

Am I reading these edit histories correctly, did this user ask take down his whole book be taken down over frustration about {{tlx|BookCat}}'s? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 11:52, 1 July 2010 (UTC)
:I still wish new pages would have {{tl|BookCat}} added to them by default, but I had added it to the edit toolbar, so that's the next best thing.  But they somehow had an edit conflict editing a page and couldn't figure out how to go back and copy-paste their content into the changed page.  Before requesting the book to be blown away, they had already moved the book from its original name and orphaned about 90% of the content they had produced with changes to the table of contents.  A bit out of proportion, but nobody else contributed to the pages, so they do qualify for speedy deletion.   &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 11:58, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

::Yeah they certainly did fall under speedy, you did the right thing, I am just a bit surprised.  It seemed the book was only just started.  Somehow I was hoping I missed spotting something more annoying then edit conflicts at the root of it, but it doesn't seem so.  Not only would hitting back have worked but there is also the second second edit box? Oh well, what can be done, it is just a shame. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 12:15, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

:::([[w:WP:TPS]]) Is it in the enhanced toolbar? If it isn't, can you add it there as well? Thanks [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 12:20, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

::::Are you trying to say something about my behavior on talk pages? Am I a WikiJaguar?  Or did you point to the wrong shortcut? &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:28, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

:::::You're not; ''I'' am. :) So, can you add it on the enhanced toolbar? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 13:06, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

::::::What exactly do you want added?  Are you wanting the userbox?  The toolbar above the edit box I'm not sure I can edit.  The shortcuts for special characters below the edit box, I can. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:21, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

:::::::Oh, that one. I must have misunderstood...  Thanks but which kind of symbol is it? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 13:37, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

::::::::You're the one who wanted something added... I'm thoroughly confused. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:40, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

:::::::::Just now you said you added the BookCat to the toolbar. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 14:04, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

::::::::::It just looks like {{tl|BookCat}}; to the left of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:06, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

:Actually, Thenub, seeing the non-blanked talk page of the user, I see that there '''was''' frustration over {{tl|BookCat}} and that an edit of mine caused the edit conflict.  I'm not going to apologize for adding {{tl|BookCat}}s, however.  Especially when someone decides to start blanking my talk page. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:36, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

:: No, there is clearly no need to apologize.  I was surprised by the extreme reaction over such a small thing.  I only noticed because I went to find author of one of the new calc books that was started to invite him to join the math project, when I couldn't find it I realized it was they same person who blanked your page and started looking at edit histories.  Well if he ever cools down and happens upon this conversation I would suggest the [[WB:RFU]]'s his book and carries on with the productive edits.  But if he can't remember to assume good faith and discuss his frustrations more constructively he probably should find another outlet.  He didn't even make clear why he was upset to anyone. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 13:08, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

::: It's not that I &quot;couldn't figure out how to go back and copy-paste&quot;, it's that my back history didn't contain the text. I 'blanked' your talk page because you reverted my earlier comment from it anyway, so I don't see it as a big deal if you're just going to revert it anyway. &quot;He didn't even make clear why he was upset to anyone&quot; Yes I did, it's on my talk page which has been deleted anonymously for some strange reason. [[User:Quasicrystal|Quasicrystal]] ([[User talk:Quasicrystal|talk]]) 02:19, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

::::Here's the full text of your comment: &quot;God dammit I just lost my edit because of a merge conflict&quot;.  Quite frankly your comment appeared to be vandalism, and I didn't revert.  I performed an undo and left a comment in the edit summary.  That's more than I could have done given the content.  Treat me with respect and you'll get the same in return. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:22, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

:::::When have I not treated you with respect? &quot;That's more than I could have done given the content&quot; I don't give a fuck if you want to threaten to ban me, I'm not asking anything from you. Also I have no idea what the difference between a revert and an undo is. [[User:Quasicrystal|Quasicrystal]] ([[User talk:Quasicrystal|talk]]) 02:25, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

::::::Assuming good faith and discussing things constructively as Thenub mentions above would be a good start.  Remarks on my talk page out of nowhere that I'm left to take as someone yelling at me over something I have no control over are what I consider disrespectful. Frankly, if you're not asking anything of me and won't refrain from trying to escalate the situation, stop posting to my talk page. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:31, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

::::::: &quot;stop posting to my talk page&quot; okay I copied this whole discussion over to my talk page [[User:Quasicrystal|Quasicrystal]] ([[User talk:Quasicrystal|talk]]) 02:34, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

== Keep it simple ==

Can you please restate the move information on the proposal and use only [[Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs Extension/Unstable]] as the location, there is no need to confuse things up in indicating {{bad link|Wikibooks:Revision review}} (I don't object to the move, but at this point it is not beneficial for mutual understanding).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:30, 3 July 2010 (UTC)
:The reading room discussion and listing of support positions is the location for linking to when filing a bugzilla request.  [[Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs Extension/Unstable]] is for your benefit and others who have not been following the conversation in the reading room and for whom the summary in the reading room is not sufficient.  {{bad link|Wikibooks:Revision review}} is a complement to [[Help:Revision review]] to document what flagged revisions means to us, not how to use it, and not how it is configured.  The reading room discussion is low-level and temporary with [[Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs Extension/Unstable]] low-level and a record of the result.  {{bad link|Wikibooks:Revision review}} and [[Help:Revision review]] are high-level documentation and not concerned with what's going on in the reading room. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:35, 3 July 2010 (UTC)
== Proposal ==

If you have the time can you help me write a clear text of what is proposed (similar to what is stated on the side bar) and with the   [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/General&amp;oldid=1868918#Reconfigure_Wikibooks configuration that is at the moment the accepted one]. By the comments some people (me included) just aren't aware of the status of all the items of the proposal at this time.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 13:37, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

:I suppose so.  I assume [[Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs Extension]] would be the destination? I'll be able to get to it a bit later today. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:42, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

::I started it here [[Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs Extension/Unstable]]. I'm rereading all the discussion making small changes to the original text based on the discussion and tagging things for clarification since my interpretation and others may not be exact or even understood.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 14:29, 2 July 2010 (UTC)
::There are something that are discussed but not stated on the sidebar I expect and we will now clearly see that people are aware that their support is on what is stated on the sidebar. Examples: the &quot;merge&quot; o editor- reviewer, other extensions...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 14:37, 2 July 2010 (UTC)
::Where can I see '''Reader Feedback Extension''' in action is any project using it? (not listed on the extension page)
::Can you link or add any more information on what is the pseudo-bot ? (in the Rights Management)
::Can you provide non technical examples for the Edit Filter Extension? (filters that we will be expecting to be implemented and the reason to adopt the extension)
::Thanks.
::PS: If the proposal passes as is, we will be getting people requesting admin flag only to participate on the quality classification.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:40, 2 July 2010 (UTC)
:::Both Wikinews and http://en.labs.wikimedia.org/ use the Reader Feedback extension.  Additional information on all the user groups is linked from the group names at [[Special:ListGrouprights]].  You're going to want to look at [[Wikibooks:Pseudo-bots]].  For examples of filters we might implement, see [[w:Special:AbuseFilter]].  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:04, 2 July 2010 (UTC)
::::Thanks. I've added some to the text. One question does &quot;Bureaucrats can add people to the Pseudo-bot group.&quot; need to be included in the proposal, isn't this an already established practice ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:06, 2 July 2010 (UTC)
:::::Yes, it does need to be included.  Currently bureaucrats can only remove admins from the pseudo-bot group, if they forget to take it off as part of their use of it.  For addition of the flag, that can only be done by admins, and only to themselves. I can vouch for this as a bureaucrat... &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 23:10, 2 July 2010 (UTC)
:::::: Can you rewrite it as Reviewers (not all people)? I think that it keeps the intention you had when you added it to the sidebar or not ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:17, 2 July 2010 (UTC)

::::::::Made a small addition, see if it conforms.
::::::::Regarding the filters, no rule is established for the adoption process (this wasn't covered on the base proposal so it shouldn't be changed but needs to be addressed on the discussion for correction). Don't you think?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:30, 2 July 2010 (UTC)
{{outdent|::::::::}}What do you mean by &quot;adoption process&quot;? &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 23:37, 2 July 2010 (UTC)
:The extension and the filters are two separated items or they not? Don't the filters need some type of proposal/discussion/adoption process ? Or can we literally take that &quot;edit filters and actions can be adjusted by administrators&quot; without intervention from the rest of the community ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:41, 2 July 2010 (UTC)
::The last sentence is correct.  If an edit filter is intrusive to the community or in any way controversial, it's not created correctly. The only ones who should even ''notice'' it's been installed are the vandals. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 23:48, 2 July 2010 (UTC)
:::Made that clear, see if you agree or can reword it better. I will remove my objection to the adoption of the policy in a few moments. I'm going neutral just because I'm not comfortable with two aspects, granting admins the exclusive right to decide what constitutes feature material and the freedom granted to them regarding filters (it has also other implications since automation will put stress on other practices like user blocks for instance).   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:58, 2 July 2010 (UTC)
::::Darklama didn't like that top level being limited either; if it might get your support maybe we should open it up and have it just be called &quot;excellent&quot;.  But then I don't see what the difference would be between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;excellent&quot; in practice, other than some metadata nobody sees.  With the top level locked you can have something similar to semi-protection with edits being allowed but screened by administrators due to changes to the page's stability settings.  That's where I'm coming from, but I suppose the scheme could be seen as elitist.  I'd like clarification on the filters, as I don't see what's objectionable.  Although, if you're looking for something to object to, you'd want to demand that the ability to create filters that automatically block be taken away. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:05, 3 July 2010 (UTC)
:::::My issue is with the personal decision that would be behind that classification. I would support it if the use of that upper qualification was based on an open decision process. As for the filter I will mention that limitation but I fear that without proper scrutinizing the changes, there will be errors made able to have serious impact on the project, it also depends on how quickly we notice them and how we chose to resolve them.

I did a kick check, just to prevent putting my foot in my mouth and see if my assumption was correct, that all current Editor have undeniably advanced the project, and noticed [[User:BarkingFish]] why does this user belong on that group ([[Special:Contributions/BarkingFish]]) was it because of the account merge/rename.

Hi Adrignola,

I have an issue with uploading files in wikibooks. I have noticed that en wikibooks it redirects to [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Upload Commons] page. But in Sinhala wikiboooks it will remain in [http://si.wikibooks.org/wiki/%E0%B7%80%E0%B7%92%E0%B7%81%E0%B7%9A%E0%B7%82:%E0%B6%8B%E0%B6%A9%E0%B7%94%E0%B6%9C%E0%B6%AD_%E0%B6%9A%E0%B7%92%E0%B6%BB%E0%B7%93%E0%B6%B8 Sinhala project].

# Why it has redirects this to commons in En wikibooks (But it has own project page in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Upload en wikipedia] )?
# Should we change the link in Sinhala wikibooks? if so then How? 

Then I have another issue in upload page. But I would like to find some answers for these 2 questions first. Then I'll shoot them. pls reply in [http://si.wikibooks.org/wiki/%E0%B6%B4%E0%B6%BB%E0%B7%92%E0%B7%81%E0%B7%93%E0%B6%BD%E0%B6%9A_%E0%B7%83%E0%B7%8F%E0%B6%9A%E0%B6%A0%E0%B7%8A%E0%B6%A1%E0%B7%8F%E0%B7%80:%E0%B6%B6%E0%B7%92%E0%B6%9F%E0%B7%94%E0%B7%80%E0%B7%8F local talk page].

== wikisource or wikibooks ==

Hi Adrignola,

I need a help again(I always have Q for you). This question is related content of the article. This is what I have understood. &lt;br /&gt;
Wikibooks is not for original books. (like [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ramayana Ramayana].) Wikisource is the place for that. [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:What_is_Wikisource%3F#Wikisource_and_other_Wikimedia_projects Wikisource and other Wikimedia projects]
:* Is that correct?

If that is Correct, we have lots of original books have uploaded into sinhala Wikibooks ( [http://si.wikibooks.org/wiki/විෂයය:සන්දේශ_කාව්‍ය සන්දේශ කාව්‍ය]) I think, that happened just because no one to guide or to help for new comers. And we don't have our own Wikisource project (Sinhala). So new comers may upload original books into Wikibooks. However that has happened. Now it is the time to solve this problem. 

My Questions:
# Is that my idea is correct?
# How can we start our own Wikisource project? (I have gone through [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Language_committee/Handbook_(requesters) Handbook]. is that OK to create a new request without any reference or something else?)
# Can I upload Sinhala content into en.Wikisource ?

pls reply in [http://si.wikibooks.org/wiki/%E0%B6%B4%E0%B6%BB%E0%B7%92%E0%B7%81%E0%B7%93%E0%B6%BD%E0%B6%9A_%E0%B7%83%E0%B7%8F%E0%B6%9A%E0%B6%A0%E0%B7%8A%E0%B6%A1%E0%B7%8F%E0%B7%80:%E0%B6%B6%E0%B7%92%E0%B6%9F%E0%B7%94%E0%B7%80%E0%B7%8F local talk page]. &lt;br /&gt;

== No worries ==

In reply to the comment at my talk page I wanted to let you know I am in ''no way'' upset/annoyed/etc. with you.  Who could fault you for being efficient? I only pointed out that it merging stopped short any discussion so we could in the future maybe we could avoid it.  

This is why I held off on merging [[Happiness]] with [[Positive Psychology]] when the idea occurred to me.  I figured if someone wanted to delete it, they might not be pleased with a merge.  And as it turned out Kayau's did not agree this was acceptable.  (By the same token I never pointed out to Panic at his talk page that he never replied to my request for comment on that RfD.  Since I would see this as a type of vote gathering that I objected to in the reconfiguration discussion.)

But I just need to stop speaking to people for a while, every discussion I have been involved in lately has been a complete mess.  Even deleting a page that contained at most two sentences on a book where I felt I was the only very active contributor was a mess.  My attempts to start a discussion on the role of external references, both at [[Wikibooks talk:Original research]] and in the reading room have (as predicted) not really lead to any fruitful discussion. Just another point to see where my opinion differs significantly from the community's.

Thanks for all the good advice, I am sorry if I have been bringing in a dark cloud over the conversations I take part in. I'll try to knock it off. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 09:18, 13 July 2010 (UTC)

:Well, that would explain your resolution to stop taking part in reading room conversations.  I have to say that I think that's unfortunate.  Your opinion is valued.  I don't want Xania's comments about people's opinions being suppressed to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Far better for you to comment on something and disagree with me or anyone else than to not speak up at all.  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:31, 13 July 2010 (UTC)

:: Well if I have something important to say I don't think I could really stop myself.  But I think what I once perceive  as discussing is really not how I come across.  By providing what I see as the best reasoned defense of my position, and attempts to debate rebuttals, etc.  I only manage to come across as harsh and as Panic says I &quot;imposing [my] view point on others&quot;.  I think it is more this superfluous type of discussion I will try to avoid, just for a little while anyways.  FWIW I also disagree with Xania on this point, and as I said, if there is something I see as important, I will make myself heard.

== Did you disagree ? ==

A transwiki in general terms is not a move, but a copy. In the specific context of a RfD it doesn't guarantee acceptance at the destination, and in fact the content of RfDs closed as delete and transwiki hasn't the same value. To what you disagree on this facts ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:18, 14 July 2010 (UTC)

My point being that it is of benefit to the project to have valid but unuseful content (that can even be a temporal situation) rightly classified as we close discussions as transwiki and to explain to participants the difference.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:23, 14 July 2010 (UTC)
:Whether I agree or disagree wasn't really the issue.  [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Using Template:Icon|That box]] is for explaining the usage of a template on the page and not for anything of a larger scope than that.  If you wish to clarify what each of those positions means, I would suggest that the text area under the &quot;requests for deletion&quot; heading would be the place to do that.

::: Your wording altered the context of the box from one of objectivity to one where conventions are defined, and did so on a transcluded subpage that will not be watched by others but yet will set the tone for anyone reading it on the page transcluding it.

If you desire to more fully flesh out each of those ''situations'', the small compact box is not the place for that.

:A bug in the same way that if you move a book and all its subpages, they will not be categorized into the new book name's category using BookCat until you null edit each of the pages in turn.

I notice that [[User:Orderud|Orderud]] has only a warning about 1 file, there seems to be 4 images from him on the category. I never wrote a rational for an image, can any one one provide it for other people's images?&lt;br&gt;

:I only placed one notice, but that notice links to the user's uploads as well as the category with images missing rationales, so it works for them all. You certainly can justify anyone's uploads.

== Reorganizing archives ==

I have a few suggestions, since you seem motivated to make changes to the archives:

* How about giving each past requests for permission its own subpage? For example &lt;tt&gt;Wikibooks:Requests for permission/Administrators/Adrignola&lt;/tt&gt;. That would make it easier to find and keep track of previous discussions just like with requests for deletion.
* RFD has some numbered archives left over that could really use being split apart to use a consistent naming system for past discussions.
* I think Archives should be kept in page names where archives only divided up by year, month, etc. because PrefixIndex can be used to return all Archives or just archives from a specific timeframe, while without Archives in the name, people can not find all archives at once.

Also could you please use the flood flag while you are reorganizing the archives? I can't keep track of other changes in the Wikibooks namespace while your doing that without the flood flag. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:07, 17 July 2010 (UTC)

:I do plan to do the RFDs too.  You read my mind.  You can see how I'm doing things at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives]].  I was doing it by date, but I can switch to by user instead.  I'll have to add some indicators such as (+Editor) or (-Editor) to some headings to indicate whether it's a removal or addition and what position (old discussions indicated removal or addition and position with many headings).  That will mean that you can't use a PrefixIndex at the above page to search by date, but it's probably more useful by person. If you include the trailing slash when using PrefixIndex like I am on the above page, you can get the dated archives.  Sorry about the flooding.  I worry that people will think I'm not being transparent if I use pseudo-bot too often.  I've hidden my edits and not much is really going on today. I'll assign the pseudo-bot flag when I resume.

:Actually, do you want it /Username with all assignments and removals on that page or do you really want it broken down by position and user in the path? &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 17:17, 17 July 2010 (UTC)

:: Well there are many ways that discussions could be broken down. People might want to look into why there was support or opposition to give a person certain tools to understand what has changed for new discussions, just as people do for books that have been brought up for deletion before. I wasn't suggesting to separate assignment and removal of tools. I think all discussion concerning a tool for a user should be archived together, not all discussions (will) end with assignment or removal happening. I think what is likely to be more important to users is understanding why there was support or opposition before and what has changed now. People can support or oppose giving one tool, but feel the opposite for another tool, so groups seems like a good point to break up a discussion to me. Further dividing discussion up by assignment or removal doesn't make since to me. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:13, 17 July 2010 (UTC)

:::I wasn't meaning to break it up by assignment or removal in the path.  But to me it would be simpler to have it be organized like /Username rather than /Position/Username, as all of a person's rights change discussions would be on the same page.  That would also cut down on the number of archive pages created.   It would also simplify any templates that might automatically point to a person's rights change discussions. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:21, 17 July 2010 (UTC)

:::: Well besides what I've pointed out already as to why by group than by user might be useful, I guess it doesn't really mater right now. If /Username archives become too big than by groups could always be added to the mix later. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:51, 17 July 2010 (UTC)

It occurs to me that if old requests for permissions were broken up by user, instead of by date, that would make it impossible to reconstruct how project standards have evolved over time.  Which seems to me to be of more vital long-term interest to the project than being able to rapidly conjure up all the records for a particular user.  Organizing by date facilitates studying the overall trends, and it's still ''possible'' to dig up all the records for a user if necessary.

So it seems to me RFP archives really should be kept by date.  (Unless there's a way to do both ''without'' guaranteeing that eventually there will be mistakes made and the two versions of history will be inconsistent with each other.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:03, 18 July 2010 (UTC)

: One solution might be to have a page to keep track of when a discussion happened, adding to the bottom of the list a link to the last archived discussion.

== Moving pages in Abstract Algebra/Groups ==

Hi, Adrignola. Thank you for reviewing my editing on the Groups section of &quot;Abstract Algebra&quot;
Since I made some mistakes in naming, I hesitate to start cross-linking. I then have 2 questions:

:1. Can mediawiki automatically fix broken links if I rename a page after I do the cross-linking?
:2. If not, is it possible to allow me to rename within the section? I can't wait to start cross-linking theorems in the section.

:You can request them at [[WB:RFP]] and if the community is in favor of it, you can certainly get editor privileges assigned.  The thing to keep in mind, though, is that people don't usually take editing on other wikis into account, simply because Wikibooks has a style, environment, and guidelines unique to itself.  As a result, they might want to wait and see.  Not because they don't trust you, but simply because we would want to be reminded to review your edits and see if there's any areas you might need guidance with.  If you at some point feel comfortable here, you can go ahead and request it on the above page.  Also, until we get our wiki configured, edits in the Wikijunior namespace don't count toward autopromotion to editor.

:Ok sorry, since the TOC will probably be deleted, didn't change it. Didn't even saw the what links there, wait for me to finish the merge it will save us some work. Ignore for now any tag on that namespace.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:09, 26 July 2010 (UTC)

:Ok I think it is finished, there are some userspace link but seems to be the creator, since he didn't participate on the discussion, and the watchlist is updated with the moves (no real merges done.

:One question, why isn't the ending summary displayed in the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming/Chapters/C%2B%2B/Print_Version&amp;printable=yes print version of the book chapters (chapter1)] ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:54, 26 July 2010 (UTC)

::It doesn't appear to be because of {{tag|small}}.  I played with it but couldn't get it to appear, even using regular HTML instead of wikisyntax and without the small tags. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:05, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

:::I will try the new stage it is a bit more flashy but removes the need for a subtitle and is easier to maintain, it may take a bit to adapt, but lets see if anyone makes any comment. Thanks for the fixing the template.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 13:47, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

::::You don't have to provide a date with {{tl|stage short}} either; it's optional.

== Advice? ==

Hi, could you take look at [[User_talk:Leighblackall#Naming|this question]] and advise? Thanks :) &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Leighblackall|Leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Leighblackall|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
:Sure. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:05, 27 July 2010 (UTC)
== Nice work ==

Nice work with [[Template:Lorem ipsum]] (though a bit complicated). I thought a short version, a medium version and a long one would be fine! &lt;code&gt;:P&lt;/code&gt; 23:58, 28 July 2010 (UTC)

:Well, it's actually the work of people whose edits were brought in via the history import.  But this is why I've made an effort to update templates in terms of features and documentation.  Many were getting left behind the equivalent versions at Wikipedia and limiting our possibilities. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:53, 29 July 2010 (UTC)

== sister templates ==

I hadn't even noticed, until you did Template:Wikipedia that's on my watchlist, that you've drastically changed the appearances of the sister templates.  Did I miss a major community discussion about trashing the Wikibooks house style?  As far as I can tell you also did ''history merges'' of the old, thoughtfully formatted templates whose appearances books relied on (and have now been [[HyperText Markup Language|betrayed by]]) with the inconsistent alien imports.  '''Common sense''' should have led you not to change the appearance simply based on the fact that it would screw over all books that expected the old appearance.  Even ''with'' consensus of the small number of us who deal with project-wide issues, if we were going to import the alien templates with their names unchanged, the old templates should have been renamed and, frankly, all pages that used them modified to use the new names before importing the aliens.  History merges of lovingly crafted Wikibooks-style templates with templates in an incompatible tradition is close to vandalism.  What on Earth were you thinking?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:30, 29 July 2010 (UTC)

:I brought in additional sister project templates quite some time ago and wanted consistency in style.  I would appreciate less hyperbole as it was a simple tweak to return to the old formatting.  And it is a side box and the minor formatting change is not equivalent to vandalism.  I really do not appreciate that tone.  You could simply have stated that you did not like the new formatting and I would have returned it to the previous, just as I have now. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:53, 29 July 2010 (UTC)

::Just to be clear, I did not compare the formatting change to vandalism, and what I did compare I did not allege to be equivalent.

::That said, I do think that the overall tone of my above post was quite unnecessarily abrasive, for which I apologize.  When I reached the limits of how much improvement could be achieved by revision at the time (for whatever reason), I should have rejected it entirely, walked away, and come back later and tried again.  The templates would have waited patiently.

::There is a subtle discrepancy with the former behavior of the templates, which I hope to have time to investigate later.  The observed effect is that the templates have vertical space between them when stacked, as in the example I linked earlier, {{nowrap|[[HyperText Markup Language]]}}.  (Does that sound familiar?  I think we may have encountered the same effect at the time of the decoupling of mbox-side.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 19:02, 29 July 2010 (UTC)

== Overview ==

Cecilia is only seen once, out riding with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle Sr.|Tom Riddle]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], examining memories illuminating [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s history, start by viewing memories of one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bob Ogden|Bob Ogden]], as he visits the house of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo Gaunt]] and his children. As that visit comes to an end, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle Sr.|Tom Riddle]], mounted on a glossy chestnut horse, and a &quot;very pretty girl&quot; on a grey, ride past the Gaunt shack. The girl, whom Riddle addresses as Cecilia and &quot;darling&quot;, is the one to notice the snake nailed to the front door of the house. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]], Marvolo's daughter, is jealous of Cecilia, because she is secretly in love with Tom Riddle.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

It seems likely that Tom Riddle and Cecilia are at least dating, and possibly are engaged to be married, or nearly.

Merope Gaunt's unrequited (at this point) love for Tom makes her jealous of Cecilia. Cecilia, on the other hand, is effectively unaware of the existence of the Gaunt family.

== Analysis ==

Apart from her name, her apparent beauty, and the fact that she rides a grey horse and is familiar enough with Tom Riddle, the heir to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Riddle Manor|the Manor]], to address him as &quot;Tom&quot;, and for him in turn to address her as &quot;darling&quot;, would indicate that they are on close, if not intimate terms. The fact that they are allowed to ride out together, unchaperoned, in the English countryside in the 1920s, would indicate that they were at least committed to each other, if not formally engaged. Her unfamiliarity with the Gaunt family would argue also that she was not from the immediate area. It is possible that Tom had somehow been involved in the war effort in the First World War, and had met Cecilia elsewhere, and was now bringing her back to see his home.

It is worthy of note, perhaps, that when Tom's body is found [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 1|some fifteen years after these events]], mention is made of his parents also being murdered, but no mention of wife or children is made. We know that Tom was shortly after these events spirited away by Merope Gaunt, and that he returned some time later having been married to her; it is entirely possible that, on Tom's decamping so precipitously, Cecilia had thrown him over and left.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= C Extensions =

Extending ruby with C extensions is relatively easy. The README.EXT [http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/trunk/README.EXT file] included with the source code for ruby is very useful and talks about creating extensions to ruby, converting ruby to c types and vice-versa.

Typically a C extension looks like

file go.c
&lt;pre&gt;
#include &quot;ruby.h&quot;

void Init_go() {

}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then you create a makefile for it by using the ''mkmf'' library.


==== Extension Config File ====

This file makes the makefile with the mkmf library. The makefile is then used with the make program to make the extension.

A simple config file looks like

file config.rb
&lt;pre&gt;
require &quot;mkmf&quot;

# the string is the init function's suffix in the .c source file. e.g, void Init_go()
# it's also the name of the extension. e.g, go.so
create_makefile(&quot;go&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Process to Make an Extension ==
This is a short overview of a simple extension that prints the classic phrase &quot;Hello!&quot; You need to know C and read the README.EXT file if you want to create something more useful.

Create a new folder and add the two files below into it.

file hello.c
&lt;pre&gt;
#include &lt;ruby.h&gt;
VALUE hello(VALUE self);

void Init_hello() {
  rb_define_global_function(&quot;hello&quot;, hello, 0);
}

VALUE hello(VALUE self)
{
  printf(&quot;Hello!\n&quot;);

  return Qnil;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

file config.rb
&lt;pre&gt;
require 'mkmf';

# extension name
extname = 'hello';

create_makefile(extname);
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now from the command prompt run the commands:
&lt;pre&gt;
ruby config.rb
make (replace with &quot;nmake&quot; for Windows SDK)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now to test it. Type this to load the extension.
&lt;pre&gt;
irb -r .\hello.so
&lt;/pre&gt;

Type in &quot;hello&quot; and IRB will echo back.

&lt;pre&gt;
irb(main):002:0&gt;hello

== Differences between 1.9 and 1.8 ==

1.9 has at least the difference of having more macros defined.
Here's how to get them in 1.8 (some of this from Phusion passenger's code).

&lt;pre&gt;

#ifndef RARRAY_LEN
	#define RARRAY_LEN(ary) RARRAY(ary)-&gt;len
#endif
#ifndef RSTRING_PTR
	#define RSTRING_PTR(str) RSTRING(str)-&gt;ptr
#endif
#ifndef RSTRING_LEN
	#define RSTRING_LEN(str) RSTRING(str)-&gt;len
#endif

#ifndef RBIGNUM_DIGITS
    #define RBIGNUM_DIGITS(obj) RBIGNUM(obj)-&gt;digits
#endif

&lt;/pre&gt;

== C extensions in Jruby ==

You can use java extensions in jruby (obviously).  You can also use [http://github.com/ffi/ffi ffi] and/or [http://github.com/remogatto/ffi-inliner ffi-inliner] gem to use native C extensions.

== How to eliminate double entries? ==

I tried to use this to make a list of books in a subject, like this:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{CategoryList|Python programming language}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
However, it listed every book twice, firstly the book page itself, and then the book category, like this:
&lt;dynamicpagelist&gt;
category=Python programming language

suppresserrors=false
shownamespace=false
ordermethod=categorysortkey
order=ascending
&lt;/dynamicpagelist&gt;
Is it possible to fix this, or is there a better template to use?

This collects images or userboxes into a single column grouping easily.  This template is not just for userboxes; it is also an efficient way of creating a column of images to run along the side of a page.

===Usage===
&lt;pre&gt;{{userboxtop
| align = 
| left =
| backgroundcolor = 
| bordercolor = 
| extra-css =
| textcolor = 
| toptext = 
}}

[userboxes]

{{userboxbottom}}&lt;/pre&gt;

All of the parameters are '''optional'''.

===Customizing===
Detailed explanations of the parameters are below.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Parameter
! Valid values
|-
| &lt;code&gt;align&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; (default) &lt;!-- &lt;code&gt;center&lt;/code&gt; does not work --&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;
| Any left margin value. Defaults to 1.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;backgroundcolor&lt;/code&gt;
| Any [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors web color] (name or &lt;tt&gt;#XXXXXX&lt;/tt&gt; hex format). Defaults to &lt;tt&gt;#FFFFFF&lt;/tt&gt;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;bordercolor&lt;/code&gt;
| Any [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors web color] (name or &lt;tt&gt;#XXXXXX&lt;/tt&gt; hex format). Defaults to &lt;tt&gt;#99B3FF&lt;/tt&gt;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;extra-css&lt;/code&gt;
| Allows you to provide additional [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets CSS] style information.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;textcolor&lt;/code&gt;
| Any [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors web color] (name or &lt;tt&gt;#XXXXXX&lt;/tt&gt; hex format). Defaults to &lt;tt&gt;#000000&lt;/tt&gt;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;toptext&lt;/code&gt;
| Overrides the standard [[Wikibooks:Userboxes|Userbox]] text and link. Can include wiki-markup.
|}

You may also insert breaks by using {{tl|userboxbreak}}. See that template for details.

===Hiding userboxes===
You can hide userboxes which utilize this (as well as a few other) forms of template-based userbox organization. Simply edit your userspace CSS override (for example, [[Special:MyPage/vector.css|vector.css]] for the Vector skin) and add the following:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;table.userboxes { display: none; }&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
This template allows for section breaks in large groups of userboxes (for purposes of categorization: for example, you could use the first/default section for languages, a second section (via this template) for interests, and so forth). This is intended for use with {{tl|userboxtop}} and {{tl|userboxbottom}} (see usage below).

===Usage===
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{userboxtop}}

[boxes]

{{userboxbreak|toptext=}}

[more boxes]

{{userboxbottom}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <comment>deprecating prettytable, replaced: prettytable → wikitable (2)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Documentation subpage}}
&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

===Usage===
&lt;pre&gt;
{{programming language|c|4}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Copy and paste the example code above, and replace &quot;c&quot; with the desired language's code and &quot;4&quot; with one of the following characters representing your proficiency level:&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Level
! Description
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 1
| This user is a beginning coder in this language.
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 2
| This user is an intermediate coder in this language.
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 3
| This user is an advanced coder in this language.
|-  style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 4
| This user is an expert coder in this language.
|}

===Customizing the format===
It is possible to customize the behavior and appearance of the template with the following override parameters (for example, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{programming language|c|4|align=left}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;).
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! align
| Set the alignment on the page. Possible values are left, center, and right (default). This also sets appropriate clearing, so that the boxes will stack automatically in that position (you can override this with the &quot;css-box&quot; override below).
|-
! css-box
| Apply arbitrary [[w:CSS|CSS]] to the box.
|-
! css-left
| Apply arbitrary [[w:CSS|CSS]] to the left cell.
|-
! css-right
| Apply arbitrary [[w:CSS|CSS]] to the right (main) cell.
|-
! category
| Setting this parameter to empty (&lt;code&gt;category=&lt;/code&gt;) displays the language box without categorizing the page. For the opposite effect&amp;mdash;categorizing the page without displaying the box, see the {{nowrap|{{tlx|Programming language/category}}}} template.
|}

===Languages supported===
See [[Wikibooks:Userboxes/Programming]] for a list of programming languages supported.

===Usage===
&lt;pre&gt;
{{user language|fr|N}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Copy and paste the example code above, and replace &quot;fr&quot; with the desired language's code and &quot;N&quot; with one of the following characters representing your fluency level:&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Level
! Description
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 0
| The user cannot communicate at all in that language.
|-
! 1
| Elementary; the user is able to write very simple questions and statements, and might be able to understand more complex sentences with difficulty. Their vocabulary is limited (excluding understanding based on similarity with other languages).
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 2
| Intermediate; the user can participate in simple discussions using simple sentence constructions, but needs help with more advanced vocabulary or structures. 
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 3
| Advanced; the user can effectively participate in discussions with native speakers, and can participate in technical discussions with relative confidence. They have a good grasp of grammar and their errors virtually never interfere with understanding.
|-  style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 4
| Near native; the user can read and write fluently and accurately at all levels of normal discussion, including technical discussions. The user can reasonably pass off as a native speaker in written discussion, and makes few errors.
|-  style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! N
| Native speaker; the user has spoken the language from birth, and has a large vocabulary and an intuitive understanding of grammar. The user can participate in all levels of discussions with ease, and can understand most errors in others' writing.

===Customizing the format===
It is possible to customize the behavior and appearance of the template with the following override parameters (for example, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{user language|fr|N|align=left}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;).
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! align
| Set the alignment on the page. Possible values are left, center, and right (default). This also sets appropriate clearing, so that the boxes will stack automatically in that position (you can override this with the &quot;css-box&quot; override below).
|-
! css-box
| Apply arbitrary [[w:CSS|CSS]] to the box.
|-
! css-left
| Apply arbitrary [[w:CSS|CSS]] to the left cell.
|-
! css-right
| Apply arbitrary [[w:CSS|CSS]] to the right (main) cell.

! category
| Setting this parameter to empty (&lt;code&gt;category=&lt;/code&gt;) displays the language box without categorizing the page. For the opposite effect, categorizing the page without displaying the box, see the {{tlx|User language/category}} template.

This is a special kind of box with a hanging icon in the right hand top corner. The size of the icon can be increased indefinitely without the height of the title bar being affected. If an empty title is specified, the title bar shrinks to a small band.

{| cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin:0em 0em 0em 0em; width:{{{width|100%}}}; {{#ifeq:{{{height|100%}}}|none||height:{{{height|100%}}}}};&quot;
| style=&quot;width:100%; {{#ifeq:{{{height|100%}}}|none||height:100%;}} vertical-align:top; border:1px solid {{Robox/C2|{{{theme|1}}}}}; background-color:{{Robox/C1|{{{theme|1}}}}};&quot; |
{{#ifeq:{{{icon|default}}}|default||[[File:{{{icon|Wikibooks-logo.svg}}}|{{{iconwidth|32px}}}|right|link=]]}}
&lt;div style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid {{Robox/C2|{{{theme|1}}}}}; background-color:{{Robox/C3|{{{theme|1}}}}}; padding:0.2em 0.9em 0.2em 0.5em; font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;{{{title|Title}}}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:0.25em 0.5em 0.2em 0.5em;&quot;&gt;

This template should be moved to [[template:bmbox]] (&quot;book message box&quot; instead of &quot;article message box&quot;). Makes way more sense, as &quot;articles&quot; do not exist on Wikibooks.

== Wikivoyage ==

{{editprotected|ans=yes}} 

Hi all. As the Wikimedia Foundation's newest project, Wikivoyage should be added into the coding of this page. In preparation for usage, I've already created [[Template:Wikivoyage]] but have not put it to use as of yet. The template should be updated to the following, with three new additions of Wikivoyage links/logo:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;

| image    = 
  {{#switch: {{{image|}}}
  | none =    &lt;!-- &quot;image=none&quot;, do nothing --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi,

Making pages that consist solely of links to Wikipedia is not useful. Wikibooks is for [[WB:WIW|textbooks]], maybe you'd like to write one. &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code style=&quot;color:#4B0082; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|mike]]@[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|en.wb]]:&amp;#126;$&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt; 14:54, 9 July 2010 (UTC)

:Agreed, however these pages are the start of a &quot;textbook&quot;. The links are for reference and to help construct the &quot;outline&quot; for cataloguing each country's stamps.[[Special:Contributions/131.225.232.212|131.225.232.212]] ([[User talk:131.225.232.212|talk]]) 15:01, 9 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

= how to do a simple query (values) =

With the win32 registry, keys mean &amp;ldquo;subkey&amp;rdquo; (like a folder), and values mean &amp;ldquo;subentry&amp;rdquo; (like file). This example shows how to look at values:

&lt;pre&gt;
require 'win32/registry'
keyname= 'SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Environment'

# KEY_ALL_ACCESS enables you to write and deleted.
# the default access is KEY_READ if you specify nothing
access = Win32::Registry::KEY_ALL_ACCESS

Win32::Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.open(keyname, access) do |reg|
  # each is the same as each_value, because #each_key actually means 
  # &quot;each child folder&quot; so #each doesn't list any child folders...
  # use #keys for that...
  reg.each{|name, value| puts name, value}
end

&lt;/pre&gt;

or

&lt;pre&gt;
a = Win32::Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.open \
  &quot;SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Environment&quot;,  Win32::Registry::KEY_READ
a.each{|n, v| p n, v}
a.close
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
require 'win32/registry'
keyname= &amp;quot;SOFTWARE&amp;quot; # this isn't actually case sensitive, but hey
access = Win32::Registry::KEY_ALL_ACCESS

= how to write default values: =

write default values (&quot;Default&quot; in regedit) by passing nil as the name, ex:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
  a.write_s nil, &quot;a default string&quot;
  # and read it back
  a.read_s nil
&lt;/pre&gt;

dir = Win32::Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.create &amp;quot;Software\\classes\\*\\shell\\open_with_arcadia\\command&amp;quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Win32API =

The Win32API is basically an easy way to designate the parameters and return value of a function in windows (for example, one contained in user32.dll), and call it.

Note that Win32API is deprecated in Ruby 1.9.2, but there will probably always be a Win32API gem around, or an ffi wrapper to it.

Note also that you may as well just use ffi, which has many windows examples available.  Another option would be to use DL.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you are new to the world of Linux audio it can be quite confusing as to how to get sound out of your machine.  Unlike audio software that is self-contained, Linux applications tend to be a bit more specialized.  Rather than having one program that is a sequencer, sampler, synthesizer, drum machine, amplifier, reverb unit, mixer and so on, each application in Linux tends to do one of these various jobs.  So how do they all work together?  That is where JACK comes in.

If this is your first time playing with PureDyne, the first thing to do is to go to the Audio menu and start up JACK Control.  You'll see an interface that looks like this:

      <comment>/* Field Effect Transistor */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Field Effect Transistor ==

The most common transistors today are FETs (Field Effect Transistor). These transistors are characterized as having a conductance between source and drain dependent on the voltage applied between the gate and the source terminals. The dependence is linear if the gate to drain voltage is also high along with the gate to source voltage. It turns into a square-law relationship if the gate to drain voltage is not enough.

== Current Voltage Characteristics ==

==Disadvantages==
One of the issues that comes up in circuit design is that as chips get smaller the insulator gets thinner and it starts to look like Swiss cheese.  As a result the insulator starts acting like a conductor.  This is known as leakage current.  One solution is to replace the insulator by a material with a higher dielectric coefficent.

Two types: enhancement and depletion.  Enhancement is the standard MOSFET, in which a channel must be induced by applying voltage.  Depletion MOSFETs have the channel implanted, and applying voltage causes the channel to cease being conductive.

FET transistors respond to the difference in voltage bias between the gate and the source.

MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor FET): standard FET

JFET (Junction Fet): When voltage is applied between the source and drain current flows.  Current only stops flowing when a voltage is applied to the gate.

MESFET (MEtal-Semiconductor FET): p-n junction is replaced with Scottky junction.  Not made with Silicon.

HEMT (High Electron Mobility Transfer): A MESFET

PHEMT (Pseudomorphic HEMT):

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor ==
''CMOS'' , Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor is not a type of transistor.  It is a logic family, based on MOS transistors.

==Construction &amp; Operation==
CMOS is made of two FETs blocking the positive and negative voltages. Since only one FET can be on at a time, CMOS consumes negligible power during any of the logic states. But when a transition between states occurs, power is consumed by the device. This power consumed is of two types. 

''Short-circuit power''
: For a very short duration, both transistors are on and a very huge current flows through the device for that duration. This current accounts for about 10% of the total power consumed by the CMOS. 

''Dynamic power''
: This is due to charge stored on the parasitic capacitance of the output node of the device. This parasitic capacitance depends on the wire's area, and closeness to other layers of metal in the IC, besides the relative permittivity of the quartz layer separating consecutive metal layers. It also depends (to a much smaller extent) upon the ''input capacitance'' of the next logic gate. This capacitance delays the rise in the output voltage and hence the rise or fall in the output of a gate is more like a that in a resistor-capacitor (RC) network. Thus the dynamic power consumed due to switching action in one gate is given by:

&lt;math&gt;P_d = C V_d^2 f&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Wien bridge Oscillator==

A '''Wien bridge oscillator''' is a type of [[electronic oscillator]] that generates [[sine wave]]s.  It can generate a large range of [[frequencies]]. The circuit is based on an electrical [[electrical network|network]] originally developed by [[Max Wien]] in 1891.
The [[bridge circuit|bridge]] comprises four [[resistor]]s and two [[capacitor]]s. It can also be viewed as a positive feedback system combined with a [[bandpass filter]]. Wien did not have a means of developing electronic [[gain]] so a workable oscillator could not be realized. 

The modern circuit is derived from [[William Reddington Hewlett|William Hewlett]]'s 1939 [[Stanford University]] master's degree thesis. Hewlett, along with [[David Packard]] co-founded [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Their first product was the HP 200A, a precision sine wave oscillator based on the Wien bridge. The 200A was one of the first instruments to produce such low [[distortion]].

==Configuaration==

:[[Image:Wien bridge classic osc.svg|frame|left|Classic Wien bridge oscillator]]
The frequency of oscillation is given by:

&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{2 \pi R C}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Phase Shift Oscillator==
A '''phase-shift oscillator''' is a simple [[sine wave]] [[electronic oscillator]]. It contains an [[inverting amplifier]], and a [[feedback]] [[Electronic filter|filter]] which 'shifts' the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the amplifier output by 180 degrees at the oscillation frequency.

The filter produces a phase shift that increases with [[frequency]].  It must have a maximum phase shift of considerably greater than 180° at high frequencies, so that the phase shift at the desired oscillation frequency is 180°.  

The most common way of achieving this kind of filter is using three identical cascaded resistor-capacitor filters, which together produce a phase shift of zero at low frequencies, and 270 degrees at high frequencies.  At the oscillation frequency each filter produces a phase shift of 60 degrees and the whole filter circuit produces a phase shift of 180 degrees.

==Op-amp implementation==
[[Image:RC phase shift oscillator.svg|frame|left|A simple example of a phase-shift oscillator]]
One of the simplest implementations for this type of oscillator uses an [[operational amplifier]] (op-amp), three [[capacitor]]s and four [[resistor]]s, as shown in the diagram.

The mathematics for calculating the oscillation frequency and oscillation criterion for this circuit are surprisingly complex, due to each R-C stage loading the previous ones.  The calculations are greatly simplified by setting all the resistors (except the [[negative feedback]] resistor) and all the capacitors to the same values.  In the diagram, if R1 = R2 = R3 = ''R'', and C1 = C2 = C3 = ''C'', then:

:&lt;math&gt;f_\mathrm{oscillation}=\frac{1}{2\pi RC\sqrt{6}}&lt;/math&gt;

and the oscillation criterion is:

:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{feedback}=29(R)&lt;/math&gt;


Without the simplification of all the resistors and capacitors having the same values, the calculations become more complex:

&lt;math&gt;f_\mathrm{oscillation}=\frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{R_2R_3(C_1C_2+C_1C_3+C_2C_3)+R_1R_3(C_1C_2+C_1C_3)+R_1R_2C_1C_2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Oscillation criterion:
&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{feedback}= 2(R_1+R_2+R_3) + \frac{2R_1R_3}{R_2} + \frac{C_2R_2+C_2R_3+C_3R_3}{C_1}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; + \frac{2C_1R_1+C_1R_2+C_3R_3}{C_2} + \frac{2C_1R_1+2C_2R_1+C_1R_2+C_2R_2+C_2R_3}{C_3}&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;math&gt; + \frac{C_1R_1^2+C_3R_1R_3}{C_2R_2} + \frac{C_2R_1R_3+C_1R_1^2}{C_3R_2} + \frac{C_1R_1^2+C_1R_1R_2+C_2R_1R_2}{C_3R_3}&lt;/math&gt;

A version of this circuit can be made by putting an op-amp buffer between each R-C stage which simplifies the calculations. Тhe voltage gain of the inverting channel is always unity.

When the oscillation frequency is high enough to be near the amplifier's [[cutoff frequency]], the amplifier will contribute significant phase shift itself, which will add to the phase shift of the feedback network.  Therefore the circuit will oscillate at a frequency at which the phase shift of the feedback filter is less than 180 degrees.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:[[File:Op-Amp Relaxation Oscillator.svg|Relaxation oscillator implemented with inverting Schmitt trigger and RC network]]
By using an [[RC network]] to add slow [[negative feedback]] to the inverting [[#Schmitt_trigger|Schmitt trigger]], a [[relaxation oscillator]] is formed. The feedback through the RC network causes the Schmitt trigger output to [[oscillate]] in an endless symmetric [[square wave]] (i.e., the Schmitt trigger in this configuration is an [[astable multivibrator]]).

==Operation==
Simulates an [[inductor]] (i.e., provides [[inductance]] without the use of a possibly costly inductor). The circuit exploits the fact that the current flowing through a capacitor behaves through time as the voltage across an inductor. The capacitor used in this circuit is smaller than the inductor it simulates and its capacitance is less subject to changes in value due to environmental changes.

This circuit is unsuitable for applications relying on the [[back EMF]] property of an inductor as this will be limited in a gyrator circuit to the voltage supplies of the op-amp.

      <comment>/* Groundwater Erosion and Deposition */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOCright}}
Rivers and streams complete the hydrologic cycle by returning precipitation that falls on land to the oceans (Figure 10.1). Ultimately, gravity is the driving force, as water moves from mountainous regions to sea level. Some of this water moves over the surface and some moves through the ground as '''groundwater'''. As this water flows it does the work of both erosion and deposition. You will learn about the erosional effects and the deposits that form as a result of this moving water.

[[File:Teuchl stream.jpg|300px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.1''': As rivers and streams move towards the ocean, they carry weathered materials.]]

==Lesson Objectives==
* Describe how surface rivers and streams produce erosion.
* Describe the types of deposits left behind by rivers and streams.
* Describe landforms that are produced as groundwater flows.

==Erosion and Deposition by Rivers and Streams==
===Erosion from Runoff===
As streams move over the ground, they transport weathered materials. Streams continually erode material away from their banks, especially along the outside curves of meanders. Some of these materials are carried in solution. Many minerals are ionic compounds that dissolve easily in water, so water moves these elements to the sea as part of the '''dissolved load''' that the stream carries. As groundwater leaches through layers of soil and rock, minerals dissolve and are carried away. Groundwater contributes most of the dissolved components that streams carry. Once an element has completely dissolved, it will likely be carried to the ocean, regardless of the velocity of the stream. In some circumstances, the stream water could become saturated with dissolved materials, in which case elements of those minerals might precipitate out of the water before they reach the ocean.

Another way that rivers and streams move weathered materials is as the '''suspended load'''. These are pieces of rock that are carried as solids as the river flows. Unlike dissolved load, the size of the particle that can be carried as suspended load is determined by the velocity of the stream. As a stream flows faster, it can carry larger and larger particles. The larger the size particle that can be carried by a stream, the greater the stream's '''competence'''. If a stream has a steep slope or  '''gradient''', it will have a faster velocity, which means it will be able to carry larger materials in suspension. At flood stage, rivers flow much faster and do more erosion because the added water increases the stream's velocity. Sand, silt and clay
size particles generally make up the suspended load for a stream (Figure 10.2). As a stream slows down, either because the stream's slope decreases or because the stream overflows its banks and broadens its channel, the stream will deposit the largest particles it has been carrying first.

[[File:Skawa River, Poland, flood 2001.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.2''': Rivers carry sand, silt and clay as suspended load. During flood stage, the suspended load greatly increases as stream velocity increases.]]

The last way that rivers and streams move weathered materials is as '''bed load'''. This means that although the water in the stream is capable of bumping and pushing these particles along, it is not able to pick them up and carry them continuously. Bed load is named for the fact that these particles get nudged and rolled along the stream bed as the water flows. Occasionally a larger size particle will get knocked into the main part of the stream flow, but then it settles back down to the stream bed because it is too heavy to remain suspended in the water. This is called '''saltation''', which we will learn about later in this chapter with transport of particles by wind. Streams with high velocities and steep gradients do a great deal of downcutting into the stream bed, which is primarily accomplished by movement of particles that make up the bed load. Particles that move along as the bed load of a stream do not move continuously along, but rather in small steps or jumps with periods of remaining stationary in between.

===Stream and River Erosion===
As a stream moves water from high elevations, like mountains, towards low elevations, like the ocean, which is at sea level, the work of the stream changes. At high elevations, streams are just beginning streams that have small channels and steep gradients. This means that the stream will have a high velocity and will do lots of work eroding its stream bed. The higher the elevation, the farther the stream is from where it eventually meets the sea. '''Base level''' is the term for where a stream meets sea level or standing water, like a lake or the ocean. Streams will work to downcut their stream beds until they reach base level.

As a stream moves out of high mountainous areas into lower areas closer to sea level, the stream is closer to its base level and does more work eroding the edges of its banks than downcutting into its stream bed. At some point in most streams, there are curves or bends in the stream channel called '''meanders''' (Figure 10.3). The stream erodes material along its outer banks and deposits material along the inside curves of a meander as it flows to the ocean (Figure 10.4). This causes these meanders to migrate laterally over time. The erosion of the outside edge of the stream's banks begins the work of carving a floodplain, which is a flat level area surrounding the stream channel.

[[File:Meander.JPG|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.3''': Here a stream can be seen actively eroding its outer banks along a meander.]]

[[File:Meander in Ashes Hollow.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.4''': This stream has deposited larger materials like gravel and pebbles along the inside curve of a meander.]]

===Stream and River Deposition===
[[File:Natural levees.png|300px|thumb|'''Figure 10.5''': After many floods, a stream builds natural levees along its banks.]]
Once a stream nears the ocean, it is very close to its base level and now deposits more materials than it erodes. As you just learned, one place where a river deposits material is along the inside edges of meanders. If you ever decide to pan for gold or look for artifacts from an older town or civilization, you will sift through these deposits. Gold is one of the densest elements on Earth. Streams are lazy and never want to carry more materials than absolutely necessary. It will drop off the heaviest and largest particles first, that is why you might find gold in a stream deposit. Imagine that you had to carry all that you would need for a week as you walked many kilometers. At first you might not mind the weight of what you are carrying at all, but as you get tired, you will look to drop off the heaviest things you are carrying first!

When a river floods or overflows its channel, the area where the stream flows is suddenly much broader and shallower than it was when it was in its channel. This slows down the velocity of the stream’s flow and causes the stream to drop off much of its load. The farmers who use the floodplain areas around the Nile River rely on these deposits to supply nutrients to their fields each year as the river floods its banks. At flood stage, a river will also build natural levees as the largest size particles build a higher area around the edges of the stream channel (Figure 10.5).

When a river meets either standing water or nearly flat lying ground, it will deposit its load. If this happens in water, a river may form a '''delta'''. From its headwaters in the mountains, along a journey of many kilometers, rivers carry the eroded materials that form their stream load. Suddenly the river slows down tremendously in velocity, and drops the tremendous load of sediments it has been carrying. Deltas are relatively flat topped, often triangular shaped deposits of sediments that form where a large river meets the ocean. The name delta comes from the capital Greek letter delta, which is a triangle, even though not all deltas have this shape. A triangular shaped delta forms as the main stream channel splits into many smaller '''distributaries'''. As the channel shifts back and forth dropping off sediments and moving to a new channel location a wide triangular deposit forms.

There are three types of beds that make up a delta (Figure 10.6). The first particles to be dropped off are the coarsest sediments and these form sloped layers called foreset beds that make up the front edge of the delta. Further out into calmer water, lighter, more fine grained sediments form thin, horizontal layers. These are called bottomset beds. During floodstage, the whole delta can be covered by finer sediments which will overlie the existing delta. These are called topset beds. These form last and lie on top of the rest of the delta.

[[File:Delta beds.png|center|frame|'''Figure 10.6''': The three types of beds that form the layers of a delta.]]

Not all large rivers form deltas as they meet the ocean. Whether a delta forms depends on the action of waves and tides. If the water is quiet water such as a gulf or shallow sea, a delta may form. If the sediments are carried away, then no delta will form. Sediments brought to the shore and distributed along coastlines by longshore transport form our beaches and barrier islands.

If a river or stream suddenly reaches nearly flat ground, like a broad flat valley or plain, an '''alluvial fan''' develops at the base of the slope (Figure 10.7). An alluvial fan is a curved top, fan shaped deposit of coarse sediments that drop off as the stream suddenly loses velocity. The fan spreads out in a curve in the direction of the flat land as many stream channels move across the curved surface of the alluvial fan, forming and unforming many channels as sediments are deposited. Alluvial fans generally form in more arid regions.

[[File:Alluvial fan in Iran.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.7''': This satellite photo of an alluvial fan in Iran shows the typical fan shape of these deposits. The stream forming the alluvial fan runs from the mountains in the southwest (lower left) corner of the photograph toward the flatter land to the northeast (upper right).  The green rectangles are farm fields which utilize the distributed water.]]

==Groundwater Erosion and Deposition==
Not all water that falls on the land flows through rivers and streams. When it rains, much of the water sinks into the ground and moves through pore spaces in soil and cracks and fractures in rock. This water necessarily moves slowly, mostly under the influence of gravity. Yet groundwater is still a strong erosional force, as this water works to dissolve away solid rock. If you have ever explored a cave or seen a sinkhole, you have some experience with the work of groundwater (Figure 10.8).

[[File:Karst italy doberdo lake.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.8''': Groundwater forms when water sinks into the ground rather than forming rivers or streams.]]

[[File:RiverExitTolantongo.JPG|300px|thumb|'''Figure 10.9''': Caverns form where groundwater dissolves rock.]]

As groundwater moves through spaces between mineral grains, it works to dissolve and carry away different elements. Some types of minerals are easily dissolved by groundwater. Rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as it falls through the air. The carbon dioxide combines with water to form carbonic acid. This naturally occurring weak acid readily dissolves many types of rock, including limestone. If you have ever watched an antacid tablet dissolve in water, you have seen an example of just how quickly this type of rock is eroded away. Caves are one of nature's most spectacular demonstrations of erosion (Figure 10.9). Working slowly over many years, groundwater dissolves and carries away elements of once solid rock in solution. First it travels along small cracks and fractures, gradually enlarging them. In time, caverns many football fields long and as high as many meters tall can form.

A '''sinkhole''' could form if the roof of an underground cave collapses. Some sinkholes are large enough to swallow up a home or several homes in a neighborhood (Figure 10.10). As groundwater dissolves away solid rock, it carries those minerals in solution as it travels. As groundwater drips through openings, several interesting types of formations occur. '''Stalactites''' are icicle like deposits of calcium carbonate which form as layer on layer of calcite drips from the ceiling, coating the 'icicle' (Figure 10.11). As mineral rich material drips to the floor of a cave, '''stalagmites''' form rounded deposits of calcium carbonate on the floor of the cave. The word stalactite has a 'C', so you can remember it forms from the ceiling, while the 'G' in stalagmite reminds you it forms on the ground. If a stalactite and stalagmite join together, they form a column. One of the wonders of visiting a cave is to witness the beauty of these amazing and strangely captivating structures. Caves also produce a beautiful type of rock, formed from calcium carbonate called '''travertine'''. This happens when groundwater saturated with calcium carbonate suddenly precipitates out as the mineral calcite or aragonite. Mineral springs that produce travertine can be hot springs or the water may just be warm or could even be cold (Figure 10.12).

When lots of calcium carbonate is carried by groundwater, we call the water 'hard'. If the water in your area is hard, it might be difficult to get soap to lather or make soapsuds. Hard water might also have a taste to it, perhaps one that some people don't like as much as pure water. If your water is 'hard', you may treat your water with a filter before you drink it. Zeolites are minerals that help to absorb ions from the water as it passes through the filter. When the water passes through the filter, it comes out tasting good!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Flip Flop==
A '''flip-flop''' is a device very like a [[Digital Circuits/Latches|latch]] in that it is a bistable multivibrator, having two states and a feedback path that allows it to store a bit of information. The difference between a latch and a flip-flop is that a latch is asynchronous, and the outputs can change as soon as the inputs do (or at least after a small propagation delay). A flip-flop, on the other hand, is ''edge-triggered'' and only changes state when a control signal goes from high to low or low to high. This distinction is relatively recent and is not formal, with many authorities still referring to flip-flops as latches and vice versa, but it is a helpful distinction to make for the sake of clarity.

There are several different types of flip-flop each with its own uses and peculiarities.  The four main types of flip-flop are : SR, JK, D, and T.

===RS Flip Flop===
An '''SR latch''' (Set/Reset) is an asynchronous device: it works independently of control signals and relies only on the state of the S and R inputs.  In the image we can see that an SR flip-flop can be created with two NOR gates that have a cross-feedback loop. SR latches can also be made from NAND gates, but the inputs are swapped and negated. In this case, it is sometimes called an '''{{overline|SR}} latch'''.

An SR (Set/Reset) flip-flop is perhaps the simplest flip-flop, and is very similar to the [[Digital Circuits/Latches#SR latch|SR latch]], other than for the fact that it only transitions on clock edges. While as theoretically valid as any flip-flop, synchronous edge-triggered SR flip-flops are extremely uncommon because they retain the illegal state when both ''S'' and ''R'' are asserted. Generally when people refer to SR flip-flops, they mean SR latches.

[[File:RS Flip-flop (NOR).svg|An SR latch made from two NOR gates.]]
[[File:SR Flip-flop Diagram.svg|An {{overline|SR}} latch made from two NAND gates.]]

|}




When a high is applied to the ''Set'' line of an SR latch, the ''Q'' output goes high (and {{overline|Q}} low). The feedback mechanism, however, means that the ''Q'' output will remain high, even when the ''S'' input goes low again. This is how the latch serves as a memory device.  Conversely, a high input on the ''Reset'' line will drive the ''Q'' output low (and {{overline|''Q''}} high), effectively resetting the latch's &quot;memory&quot;. When both inputs are low, the latch &quot;latches&quot; – it remains in its previously set or reset state.

When both inputs are high at once, however, there is a problem: it is being told to simulataneosuly produce a high ''Q ''and a low ''Q''. This produces a &quot;race condition&quot; within the cirucit - whichever flip flop succeeds in changing first will feedback to the other and assert itself. Ideally, both gates are identical and this is &quot;metastable&quot;, and the device will be in an undefined state for an indefinite period. In real life, due to manufacturing methods, one gate will always win, but it's impossible to tell which it will be for a particular device from an assembly line. The state of ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 is therefore &quot;illegal&quot; and should never be entered.


When the device is powered up, a similar condition occurs, because both outputs, ''Q'' and {{overline|Q}}, are low. Again, the device will quickly exit the metastable state due to differences between the two gates, but it's impossible to predict which of ''Q'' and {{overline|''Q''}} will end up high. To avoid spurious actions, you should always set SR flip-flops to a known initial state before using them - you must not assume that they will initialise to a low state.

==Gated Flip Flop==
===Gated SR latch===
In some situations it may be desirable to dictate when the latch can and cannot latch.  The '''gated SR latch''' is a simple extension of the SR latch which provides an ''Enable'' line which must be driven high before data can be latched.  Even though a control line is now required, the SR latch is not synchronous, because the inputs can change the output even in the middle of an enable pulse.

When the ''Enable'' input is low, then the outputs from the AND gates must also be low, thus the ''Q'' and {{overline|''Q''}} outputs remain latched to the previous data.  Only when the enable input is high can the state of the latch change, as shown in the truth table. When the enable line is asserted, a gated SR latch is identical in operation to an SR latch.

The ''Enable'' line is sometimes a clock signal, but is usually a read or write [[Digital Circuits/Glossary#S|strobe]].

|}

===Gated D latch===
The '''D latch''' (D for &quot;data&quot;) or '''transparent latch''' is a simple extension of the gated SR latch that removes the possibility of invalid input states.

Since the gated SR latch allows us to latch the output without using the ''S'' or ''R'' inputs, we can remove one of the inputs by driving both the ''Set'' and ''Reset'' inputs with a complementary driver: we remove one input and automatically make it the inverse of the remaining input.

The D latch outputs the ''D'' input whenever the ''Enable'' line is high, otherwise the output is whatever the ''D'' input was when the ''Enable'' input was last high. This is why it is also known as a transparent latch - when ''Enable'' is asserted, the latch is said to be &quot;transparent&quot; - it signals propagate directly through it as if it isn't there.

|}

D latches are often used in I/O ports of integrated circuits and are available as discrete devices, often multiply packaged. An example is the 74HC75, part of the 7400 series of ICs, containing four separate D latches.

==Clock - Controlled Flip Flops ==
===D flip-flop===
The D flip-flop is the edge-triggered variant of the transparent latch. On the rising (usually, although negative edge triggering is just as possible) edge of the clock, the output is given the value of the ''D'' input ''at that moment''. The output can only change at the clock edge, and if the input changes at other times, the output will be unaffected.

D flip-flops are by far the most common type of flip-flops and some devices (for example some FPGAs) are made entirely from D flip-flops. They are also commonly used for shift-registers and input synchronisation.

|}

===JK Flip-flop===
The JK flip-flop is a simple enhancement of the SR flip-flop where the state J=K=1
is not forbidden. It works just like a SR FF where J is serving as set input
and K serving as reset. The only difference is
that for the formerly “forbidden” combination J=K=1 this flip-flop now performs
an action: it inverts its state.
As the behavior of the JK flip-flop is completely predictable under all conditions,
this is the preferred type of flip-flop for most logic circuit designs.
But there is still a problem i.e. both the outputs are same when one tests the circuit practically. This is because of the
internal toggling on every propagation elapse completion. The main remeady is going for master-slave jk flip-flop,this ff overrides the self(internal) recurring toggling through the pulsed clocking feature incorporated.

===T flip-flops===
A '''T flip-flop''' is a device which swaps or &quot;toggles&quot; state every time it is triggered if the ''T'' input is asserted, otherwise it holds the current output. This behavior is described by the characteristic equation:

::&lt;math&gt;Q_{next} = T \oplus Q = T\overline{Q} + \overline{T}Q&lt;/math&gt;

and can be described either of the following tables:

|}
|}

When ''T'' is held high, the toggle flip-flop divides the clock frequency by two; that is, if clock frequency is 4 MHz, the output frequency obtained from the flip-flop will be 2 MHz. This 'divide-by' feature has application in various types of digital [[Digital Circuits/Counters|counters]].  A ''T'' flip-flop can also be built using a JK flip-flop (J &amp; K pins are connected together and act as T) or D flip-flop (''T'' input and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;prev&lt;/sub&gt; are connected to the ''D'' input through an XOR gate).

==Lesson Objectives==
* Describe how the action of waves produces different shoreline features.
* Discuss how areas of quiet water produce deposits of sand and sediment.
* Discuss how some of the structures humans build to help defend against wave erosion.

==Wave Action and Erosion==
Have you ever been to visit a beach? Some beaches have large, strong rolling waves that rise up and collapse as they crash into the shore. All waves are ''energy'' traveling through some type of material (Figure 10.13). The waves that we are most familiar with travel through water. Most of these waves form from wind blowing over the water; sometimes steady winds that blow and sometimes from a storm that forms over the water. The energy of waves does the work of erosion when a wave reaches the shore. When you find a piece of frosted glass along a beach, you have found some evidence of the work of waves. What other evidence might you find?

[[File:Wea00816.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.13''': Ocean waves are energy traveling through water.]]

As wind blows over the surface of the water, it disturbs the water, producing the familiar shape of a wave. You can see this shape in Figure 10.14. The highest part of a wave is called the '''wave crest'''. The lowest part is called the '''wave trough'''. The vertical distance from the highest part of a wave to the lowest is called the '''wave height'''. The horizontal distance between one wave crest and the next crest, is called the '''wavelength'''. Three things influence how big a wave might get. If the wind is very strong, and it blows steadily for a long time over a long distance, the very largest waves will form. The wind could be strong, but if it gusts for just a short time, large waves won't form. Bigger waves do more work of erosion which changes our shorelines. Each day that waves break along the shore, they steadily erode away a minute bit of the shoreline. When one day, a really big storm like a
hurricane arrives, it will do a lot of damage in just a very short time.

[[File:Wave form.png|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.14''': Each wave form has a wave crest, trough, height, and wavelength.]]

As waves come into shore, they usually reach the shore at some angle. This means one part of the wave reaches shallow water sooner than the parts of the wave that are further out. As a wave comes into shore, the water 'feels' the bottom which slows down the wave. So the shallower parts of the wave slow down more than the parts that are further from the shore. This makes the wave 'bend', which is called '''refraction'''. The way that waves bend as they come into shore either concentrates wave energy or disperses it. In quiet water areas like bays, wave energy is dispersed and sand gets deposited. Areas like cliffs that stick out into the water, are eroded away by the strong wave energy that concentrates its power on the cliff (Figure 10.15).

[[File:Erodedcliffpacifica.jpg|frame|center|'''Figure 10.15''': Cliffs are eroded by wave action that concentrates energy in these areas.]]

Wave-cut cliffs form where waves cut into the bottom part of the cliff, eroding away the soil and rocks there. First the waves cut a notch into the base of the cliff. If enough material is cut away, the cliff above can collapse into the water. Many years of this type of erosion can form a '''wave-cut platform''' (Figure 10.16).

[[File:Wavecut platform southerndown pano.jpg|500px|thumb|center|'''Figure 10.16''': This large wave cut platform was formed by the cutting action of waves on the cliffs to the left.]]
[[File:Dorset, stack (small).jpg|right|frame|'''Figure 10.18''': A sea stack forms if the upper layers of rock collapse, leaving an isolated pinnacle.]]

If waves erode a cliff from two sides, the erosion produced can form an open area in the cliff called an '''arch''' (Figure 10.17). If the material above the arch eventually erodes away, a piece of tall rock can remain in the water, which is called a '''sea stack''' (Figure 10.18).

==Wave Deposition==
Rivers carry the sand that comes from erosion of mountains and land areas of the continents to the shore. Soil and rock are also eroded from cliffs and shorelines by waves. That material is transported by waves and deposited in quieter water areas. As the waves come onto shore and break, water and particles move along the shore. When lots of sand accumulates in one place, it forms a beach. Beaches can be made of mineral grains, like quartz, but beaches can also be made of pieces of shell or coral or even bits of broken hardened lava (Figure 10.19).

[[File:PismoBeachSand.JPG|500px|thumb|center|'''Figure 10.19''': Quartz, rock fragments, and shell make up the sand along a beach.]]

Waves continually move sand grains along the shore. Smaller particles like silt and clay don't get deposited at the shore because the water here is too turbulent. The work of waves moves sand from the beaches on shore to bars of sand offshore as the seasons change. In the summer time, waves of lower energy bring sand up onto the beach and leave it there. That is good for the many people who enjoy sitting on soft sand when they visit the beach (Figure 10.20). In the wintertime, waves and storms of higher energy bring the sand from the beach back offshore. If you visit your favorite beach in the wintertime, you will find a steeper, rockier beach than the flat, sandy beach of summer. Some communities truck in sand to resupply sand to beaches. It is very important to study the energy of the waves and understand the types of sand particles that normally make up the beach before spending lots of money to do this. If the sand that is trucked in has pieces that are small enough to be carried away by the waves on that beach, the sand will be gone in a very short time.

[[File:Fotografia da Praia de Copacabana.JPG|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.20''': Sand deposits in quiet areas along a shoreline to form a beach.]]
[[File:Padre Island National Seashore - sand dunes3.jpg|right|frame|'''Figure 10.21''': These sand dunes are part of Padre Island off the coast of Texas, which is a barrier island.]]

Sand transported by the work of waves breaking along the shore can form sand bars that stretch across a bay or ridges of sand that extend away from the shore, called '''spits'''. Sometimes the end of a spit hooks around towards the quieter waters of the bay as waves refract, causing the sand to curve around in the shape of a hook.

When the land that forms the shore is relatively flat and gently sloping, the shoreline may be lined with long narrow islands called '''barrier islands''' (Figure 10.21). Most barrier islands are just a few kilometers wide and tens of kilometers long. Many famous beaches, like Miami Beach, are barrier islands. In its natural state, a barrier island acts as the first line of defense
against storms like hurricanes.

Instead of keeping barrier islands natural, these areas end up being some of the most built up, urbanized areas of our coastlines. That means storms, like hurricanes, damage houses and businesses rather than hitting soft, vegetated sandy areas. Some hurricanes have hit barrier islands so hard that they break right through the island, removing sand, houses and anything in the way.

==Protecting Shorelines==
Humans build several different types of structures to try to slow down the regular work of erosion that waves produce and to help prevent damage to homes from large storms. One structure that people build, called a '''groyne''', is a long narrow pile of rocks that extends out into the water, at right angles to the shoreline (Figure 10.22). The groyne traps sand on one side of the groyne, keeping the sand there, rather than allowing it to move along the coastline. This works well for the person who is on the upcurrent side of the groyne, but it causes problems for the people on the opposite, downcurrent side. Those people no longer have sand reaching the areas in front of their homes. What happens as a result is that people must build another groyne to trap sand there. This means lots of people build groynes, but it is not a very good answer to the problem of wave erosion.

[[File:53sitges.jpg|center|frame|'''Figure 10.22''': Groynes are built perpendicular to the shoreline to help keep sand from moving
off the beach.]]

Some other structures that people build include '''breakwaters''' and '''sea walls''' (Figure 10.23). Both of these are built parallel to the shoreline. A breakwater is built out away from the shore in the water while a sea wall is built right along the shore. Breakwaters are built in bay areas to help keep boats safe from the energy of breaking waves. Sometimes enough sand deposits in these quiet water areas that people then need to work to remove the sand. Sea walls are built to protect beach houses from waves during severe storms. If the waves in a storm are very large, sometimes they erode away the whole sea wall, leaving the area unprotected entirely. People do not always want to choose safe building practices, and instead choose to build a beach house right on the beach. If you want your beach house to stay in good shape for many years, it is smarter to build your house away from the shore.

[[File:Offelmer.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.23''': Breakwaters are visible in this satellite image, built parallel to the shoreline to protect areas from strong waves.]]

==Lesson Summary==
* Waves in the ocean are what we see as energy travels through the water.
* The energy of waves produces erosional formations like cliffs, wave cut platforms, sea arches, and sea stacks.
* When waves reach the shore, deposits like beaches, spits, and barrier islands form in certain areas.
* Groynes, jetties, breakwaters, and sea walls are structures humans build to protect the shore from the erosion of breaking waves.

==Review Questions==
# Name three structures that people build to try to prevent wave erosion.
# Name three natural landforms that are produced by wave erosion.
# What are the names of the parts of a waveform?
# Describe the process that produces wave refraction.
# If you were to visit a beach in a tropical area with coral reefs, what would the beach there be made of?

      <text xml:space="preserve">PCP (phencyclidine) was developed in the 1950s as an intravenous anesthetic. Its use has since been discontinued due to serious adverse effects. PCP is a white crystalline powder that is readily soluble in water or alcohol. It has a distinctive bitter chemical taste. PCP can be mixed easily with dyes and is often sold on the illicit drug market in a variety of tablet, capsule, and colored powder forms that are normally snorted, smoked, or orally ingested. For smoking, PCP is often applied to a leafy material such as mint, parsley, oregano, or marijuana. Depending upon how much and by what route PCP is taken, its effects can last approximately 4–6 hours. 

==Health and Saftey==
===Effects on the Brain===
The use of PCP as an approved anesthetic in humans was discontinued in 1965 because patients often became agitated, delusional, and irrational while recovering from its anesthetic effects. PCP is a “dissociative drug,” meaning that it distorts perceptions of sight and sound and produces feelings of detachment (dissociation) from the environment and self. First introduced as a street drug in the 1960s, PCP quickly gained a reputation as a drug that could cause bad reactions and was not worth the risk. However, some abusers continue to use PCP due to the feelings of strength, power, and invulnerability as well as a numbing effect on the mind that PCP can induce. Among the adverse psychological effects reported are—

* Symptoms that mimic schizophrenia, such as delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, disordered thinking, and a sensation of distance from one’s environment.
* Mood disturbances: Approximately 50 percent of individuals brought to emergency rooms because of PCP-induced problems—related to use within the past 48 hours—report significant elevations in anxiety symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Yago, KB, Pitts, FN, Burgoyne, RW, Aniline, O, Yago, LS, Pitts AF. The urban epidemic of phencyclidine (PCP) use: Clinical and laboratory evidence from a public psychiatric hospital emergency service. J Clin Psychiatry 42:193–196, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;
* People who have abused PCP for long periods of time have reported memory loss, difficulties with speech and thinking, depression, and weight loss. These symptoms can persist up to one year after stopping PCP abuse.
* Addiction: PCP is addictive—its repeated abuse can lead to craving and compulsive PCP-seeking behavior, despite severe adverse consequences. 

===Other Effects===
At low-to-moderate doses, physiological effects of PCP include a slight increase in breathing rate and a pronounced rise in blood pressure and pulse rate. Breathing becomes shallow; flushing and profuse sweating, generalized numbness of the extremities, and loss of muscular coordination may occur.

At high doses, blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiration drop. This may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, flicking up and down of the eyes, drooling, loss of balance, and dizziness. PCP abusers are often brought to emergency rooms because of overdose or because of the drug’s severe untoward psychological effects. While intoxicated, PCP abusers may become violent or suicidal and are therefore dangerous to themselves and others. High doses of PCP can also cause seizures, coma, and death (though death more often results from accidental injury or suicide during PCP intoxication). Because PCP can also have sedative effects, interactions with other central nervous system depressants, such as alcohol and benzodiazepines, can also lead to coma.

Hey Thenub314,

I got back to editing today and I was looking for a way to return to a section in an article.  I went to some of your posts and found this one.

Ironically it showed me how to do what I was looking for [[High_School_Mathematics_Extensions/Mathematical_Programming/Exercise 1: The Complete Program |So thats how you do it]]


... well I could get it to work in my article where I didn't have to name the root node.


I just spent 45 minutes messing with the above and now my wife has some stuff for me to do.


I appreciate your position, but I also have some history with legalism that I might write about here later ...


Anyway, I think the canonical response to not liking an article is to write a counter-article.


In addition I think it might be good to have a Wiki portal that doesn't have links to harmful / mature material.  I am adding to the Algebra text book in an effort to practice my explanatory skills.  I would like to use this material in a classroom, but I now know that I need to be careful when I approach any potential school administrators about opening up their firewall to wikibooks in general.

      <comment>/* GLPSOL plus AWK */ Title changed</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page covers the use of external [[w:Scripting_language|scripting languages]] with [[GLPK/GMPL_(MathProg)|MathProg]]. 

__FORCETOC__

== Passing values via the command-line ==

Please see the [[GLPK/Using_GLPSOL#Passing_values_via_the_command-line|section]] on passing values via the command-line.  The method involves a creating a simple shell script (or batch file).

== Parametric studies and MathProg ==

The [[GLPK/GMPL_(MathProg)|MathProg]] language does not offer [[w:Control_flow|control structures]] in the interests of simplicity and efficiency (a restriction that does not apply to [[w:Compiled_language|compiled language]] programming with the GLPK API).
This lack of control structures prevents the direct implementation of [[w:Sensitivity_analysis|parametric studies]] within MathProg &amp;mdash; where one would like to perform a simple [[w:For_loop|loop]] over a range of [[w:Parameter|parameter]] values with the MathProg &lt;tt&gt;solve&lt;/tt&gt; statement nested inside. A parametric study is the same as a sensitivity analysis.

One work-around is to use a scripting language to [[#GLPSOL_plus_AWK|generate and run]] a number of GLPK model instances. A more sophisticated approach would be to use a [[w:Relational_database|relational database]] for the storage of interim solutions. 

=== GLPSOL and AWK ===

[[w:Awk|AWK]] is a well-established scripting language with a [[w:C_(programming_language)|C]]-like syntax. GNU AWK is present by default on most [[Linux]] distros, otherwise install the &lt;tt&gt;gawk&lt;/tt&gt; package. [[Windows]] users can obtain GNU AWK binaries from [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gawk.htm gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gawk.htm].

AWK makes it possible to create GMPL data files and then invoke glpsol on these newly-created files. This means AWK is a good choice for undertaking parametric studies in association with GMPL. It is normally better to use one volatile data file for your scanned parameters and another stable data file for the rest of your model data (glpsol supports multiple data files). 

The rudimentary example below is presented as a stub for developing your own parameter scanning scripts. This example repeatedly writes the parameter &lt;tt&gt;iter&lt;/tt&gt; to a volatile data file &lt;tt&gt;test.dat&lt;/tt&gt; and then calls glpsol to display the value of this parameter. This script also generates the model file &lt;tt&gt;test.mod&lt;/tt&gt; at the outset, but normally your model file would preexist. [[Windows]] users will need to replace the Linux [[w:Rm_(Unix)|remove]] command '''&lt;tt&gt;rm --force&lt;/tt&gt;''' with '''&lt;tt&gt;del&lt;/tt&gt;'''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;awk&quot;&gt;
# AWK script
# provides a starting point for developing custom parameter scanning scripts

BEGIN {
modfile = &quot;test.mod&quot;;
datfile = &quot;test.dat&quot;;
system(&quot;rm --force &quot; modfile);        # Linux remove call
printf (&quot;Writing model file\n&quot;);
printf (&quot;# model file\n&quot;) &gt; modfile;
printf (&quot;param iter;\n&quot;) &gt; modfile;
printf (&quot;solve;\n&quot;) &gt; modfile;
printf (&quot;display iter;\n&quot;) &gt; modfile;
printf (&quot;end;\n&quot;) &gt; modfile;
close(modfile);
for (i = 1; i &lt;= 5; i++) {
  system(&quot;rm --force &quot; datfile);      # Linux remove call
  printf(&quot;\n\nIteration %i\n&quot;, i);
  printf (&quot;Writing data file\n&quot;);
  printf(&quot;# data file %i\n&quot;, i) &gt; datfile;
  printf(&quot;data;\n&quot;) &gt; datfile;
  printf(&quot;param iter := %i;\n&quot;, i) &gt; datfile;
  printf(&quot;end;\n&quot;) &gt; datfile;
  close(datfile);
  system(&quot;glpsol --model &quot; modfile &quot; --data &quot; datfile);
  }
exit;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Save this script as text file &lt;tt&gt;scan.awk&lt;/tt&gt; and then run it from the command-line:

&lt;pre&gt;
$ awk --file scan.awk 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Edited terminal output from iteration 2 is as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
Iteration 2
Writing data file
GLPSOL: GLPK LP/MIP Solver, v4.44
Reading model section from test.mod...
Reading data section from test.dat...
Model has been successfully generated
GLPK Simplex Optimizer, v4.44
0 rows, 0 columns, 0 non-zeros
~     0: obj =   0.000000000e+00  infeas =  0.000e+00
OPTIMAL SOLUTION FOUND
Display statement at line 4
iter = 2
Model has been successfully processed
&lt;/pre&gt;

The same basic idea can be implemented in virtually any scripting language, from [[w:Bash_(Unix_shell)|bash]] upwards. In addition, astute readers may notice that altered model (as opposed to data) files can also be constructed on-the-fly using similar scripting methods.

=== GLPSOL and Visual Basic Script ===
Visual Basic Script is programming language delivered with Microsoft Windows.

Visual Basic Script makes it possible to create GMPL data files and then invoke glpsol on these newly-created files.

The example below demonstrates how this can be done.

Create a model file &lt;tt&gt;test.mod&lt;/tt&gt; which will only print parameter &lt;tt&gt;p&lt;/tt&gt;.
&lt;source lang=dos&gt;
param p;
printf &quot;Parameter p = %d\n&quot;, p;
end;
&lt;/source&gt;
Create a script &lt;tt&gt;test.vbs&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Const ForWriting = 2
Set wshShell = WScript.CreateObject (&quot;WSCript.shell&quot;)
Set fso = CreateObject(&quot;Scripting.FileSystemObject&quot;)
Set sout = WScript.StdOut
For i = 1 To 3
  'Write data file
  Set MyFile = fso.OpenTextFile(&quot;test.dat&quot;, ForWriting, True)
  MyFile.WriteLine &quot;data;&quot;
  MyFile.WriteLine &quot;param p := &quot; &amp; i &amp; &quot;;&quot;
  MyFile.WriteLine &quot;end;&quot;
  MyFile.Close
  'Execute glpsol
  Set oExec = wshShell.exec(&quot;glpsol -m test.mod -d test.dat&quot;)
  'Copy output of glpsol to console used by script
  While Not oExec.StdOut.AtEndOfStream
    sout.Write oExec.StdOut.Read(1)
  Wend
Next
&lt;/source&gt;
Run the script with
&lt;source lang=dos&gt;
cscript test.vbs
&lt;/source&gt;

=== GLPSOL and Visual Basic for Applications ===
Visual Basic Script is programming language delivered with Microsoft Office.

VBA makes it possible to create GMPL files and then invoke glpsol on these newly-created files.

The example below demonstrates how this can be done.

&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Option Explicit

Private Declare Function WaitForSingleObject Lib &quot;kernel32&quot; ( _
    ByVal hHandle As Long, _
    ByVal dwMilliseconds As Long) As Long

Private Declare Function OpenProcess Lib &quot;kernel32.dll&quot; ( _
    ByVal dwDesiredAccess As Long, _
    ByVal bInheritHandle As Long, _
    ByVal dwProcessId As Long) As Long

Private Declare Function CloseHandle Lib &quot;kernel32&quot; ( _
    ByVal hObject As Long) As Long
    
Private Const SYNCHRONIZE = &amp;H100000
Private Const INFINITE = -1&amp;
Private Const MinimizedNoFocus = 6

' Model file
Private Const modfile = &quot;C:\TEMP\test.mod&quot;
' Result file
Private Const resfile = &quot;C:\TEMP\test.res&quot;

Public Sub parametricStudy()
  Dim p As Double
  Dim r As String
  For p = 0.5 To 2.5 Step 0.2
    r = r &amp; runGLPK(p) &amp; vbCrLf
  Next p
  MsgBox r, vbOKOnly, &quot;Result&quot;
End Sub

Private Function runGLPK(p As Double) As String
  Dim f As Integer
  Dim s As String
  Dim pid As Long
  Dim h As Long
  Dim x As String
  Dim y As String
  
  ' Convert double to string
  s = p
  s = Replace(s, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;)
  ' Create model file
  f = FreeFile()
  Open modfile For Output As f
  Print #f, &quot;param f, symbolic := &quot;&quot;&quot; &amp; resfile &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot;;&quot;
  Print #f, &quot;var x, &gt;=0;&quot;
  Print #f, &quot;var y, &gt;=0;&quot;
  Print #f, &quot;maximize obj : x + &quot;; s; &quot; * y; &quot;
  Print #f, &quot;s.t. c1 : x + y &lt;= 4;&quot;
  Print #f, &quot;s.t. c2 : x + 2 * y &lt;= 6;&quot;
  Print #f, &quot;solve;&quot;
  Print #f, &quot;printf &quot;&quot;%f\n&quot;&quot;, x &gt; f;&quot;
  Print #f, &quot;printf &quot;&quot;%f\n&quot;&quot;, y &gt;&gt; f;&quot;
  Print #f, &quot;end;&quot;
  Close f
  ' Delete result fle
  If Dir(resfile) &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot; Then
    Kill resfile
  End If
  ' Start glpsol
  pid = Shell(&quot;&quot;&quot;C:\Program Files\GLPK\glpk-4.47\w32\glpsol.exe&quot;&quot; -m &quot; &amp; modfile, MinimizedNoFocus)
  If pid = 0 Then
    MsgBox &quot;Failure to start glpsol.exe&quot;, vbCritical, &quot;Error&quot;
    Exit Function
  End If
  ' Wait for glpsol to end
  h = OpenProcess(SYNCHRONIZE, 0, pid)
  If h &lt;&gt; 0 Then
    WaitForSingleObject h, INFINITE
    CloseHandle h
  End If
  ' Check if result file written
  If Dir(resfile) = &quot;&quot; Then
    MsgBox &quot;No result from glpsol.exe&quot;, vbCritical, &quot;Error&quot;
    Exit Function
  End If
  ' Output result
  Open resfile For Input As f
  Line Input #f, x
  Line Input #f, y
  Close f
  runGLPK = &quot;p = &quot; &amp; s &amp; &quot; =&gt; x = &quot; &amp; x &amp; &quot;, y = &quot; &amp; y
End Function
&lt;/source&gt;

== Python and PyMathProg ==

If shell-command-based scripting (using AWK) is not flexible enough, then the [[w:Python_(programming_language)|Python]] language and the [http://pymprog.sourceforge.net PyMathProg] package provide a more powerful alternative. [[GLPK/Python#PyMathProg|PyMathProg]] allows one to write linear and mixed-integer programming models &amp;mdash; in a form very much like GMPL &amp;mdash; using Python. A succinct example of how PyMathProg can be used to implement a subtour elimination heuristic is given [http://pymprog.sourceforge.net/subtour.html here].

== Python and Sage ==

''Comment'': this material should be extended.

[[w:Sage_(mathematics_software)|Sage]] is an open source mathematics environment, offering both symbolic and numerical calculation and good visualization. Sage supports the [[w:Python_(programming_language)|Python language]] and GLPK is available through the Sage [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/numerical/mip.html optimization module].

A mixed-integer model is first built using an instance of class &lt;tt&gt;MixedIntegerLinearProgram&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;mdash; and then solved using its &lt;tt&gt;solve&lt;/tt&gt; method, with the solver set to GLPK:

&lt;pre&gt;
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(maximization=True)
sage: x = p.new_variable()
...
sage: p.solve(solver=&quot;GLPK&quot;, log=&quot;filename.log&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The overhead for installing Sage is apparently quite high, but the environment works well.

== Suppressing terminal output under Python ==

Terminal output may be suppressed as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import subprocess
capture = subprocess.check_output([&quot;glpsol&quot;, &quot;--math&quot;, &quot;noisy.mod&quot;, &quot;--output&quot;, &quot;noisy.out&quot;])
print (&quot;complete&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Save the above scripting to a file named &lt;tt&gt;quiet.py&lt;/tt&gt; and then execute it:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; python quiet.py
complete
&lt;/pre&gt;

GLPSOL's normal output is stored in &lt;tt&gt;capture&lt;/tt&gt; for later use.
The model's solution is saved as file &lt;tt&gt;noisy.out&lt;/tt&gt;.  
And only the explicit &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; statement is sent to the console.

Similar techniques could be applied to other scripting languages, including Bash and Perl.  Moreover, command-line arguments could be passed through to the final call to aid flexibility.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page describes the steps that GLPK takes when processing a model written in GMPL (also known as MathProg).

== Processing steps ==

GLPK solves a model in a series of steps.

=== Model section translation ===
The model section of the GMPL file is parsed and internal 
structures describing the different objects, such as variables,
constraints, and expressions, are created.
This phase is executed by the function &lt;tt&gt;glp_mpl_read_model&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Data section translation ===
The data section of the model file is used to initialize
parameters and sets. If the data section is contained within the model file, this phase is
executed by the function &lt;tt&gt;glp_mpl_read_model&lt;/tt&gt;. If data files are (optionally) provided, 
this phase is executed by the function &lt;tt&gt;glp_mpl_read_data&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Model generation ===
In this phase, the statements and expressions of the model up
to the GMPL solve statement, are evaluated. This phase is executed by 
the function &lt;tt&gt;glp_mpl_generate&lt;/tt&gt;.
Model generation can be computationally expensive and users should expect the
process of generating large or complex models to take time.

The constraints themselves are normalized according to the following rules:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Original form          !! Standard form
|-
| &lt;math&gt;a x + b \ge c y + d&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;a x - c y \ge d - b&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;a x + b \le c y + d&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;a x - c y \le d - b&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;a x + b  =  c y + d\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;a x - c y  =  d - b\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;c \le a x + b \le d&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;c - b \le a x \le d - b&lt;/math&gt;
|}

&lt;!-- the &quot;\,\!&quot; are hacks to force PNG maths output --&gt;

Dual values are calculated using the '''standard form''' of the constraint. This implies that, in the following example, the dual value of &lt;tt&gt;c2&lt;/tt&gt; will take the opposite sign relative to the dual value of &lt;tt&gt;c1&lt;/tt&gt; for the ''otherwise equivalent'' constraint formulations:
&lt;pre&gt;
s.t. c1 : 3 * z = 1;
s.t. c2 : 1 = 3 * z;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Care is therefore required when interpreting the dual values for nonstandard constraints. Conversely, good practice suggests using the standard forms where practical.

=== Model building ===
The problem instance for the solver is created. This phase is 
executed by the function &lt;tt&gt;glp_mpl_build_prob&lt;/tt&gt;.
This call will fail if not preceded by a call to
&lt;tt&gt;glp_mpl_generate&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Solution ===
A solution is attempted by calling the appropriate solver: simplex, interior-point, or MIP.

=== Postsolving ===
The results of the solver call are transferred back to the GMPL variables
and constraints. All statements after the solve statement in 
the model file are executed. This phase is executed by function
&lt;tt&gt;glp_mpl_postsolve&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Further study ==

More details can be obtained by examining:

* function &lt;tt&gt;glp_main&lt;/tt&gt; in implementation file &lt;tt&gt;src/glpapi19.c&lt;/tt&gt; (as of GLPK 4.45)
* the example in chapter 3.2 ''Routines for processing MathProg models'' in &lt;tt&gt;doc/glpk.pdf&lt;/tt&gt; from the source distribution.

== Prescribed starts ==

It is not possible to specify a feasible (but possibly suboptimal) starting solution when using GLPSOL &amp;mdash; but this feature is supported when 
programming with the GLPK API using the [[GLPK/API_usage#Prescribed_starts|callback hook]] of the branch-and-cut algorithm.

&lt;!-- delete this text in March-2011 --
Specify a callback function in parameter parm-&gt;cb_func when calling glp_intopt. Provide the starting solution when for the first time glp_ios_reason called from the callback function returns GLP_IHEUR.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[Colonel Roy Campbell (ロイ・キャンベル大佐, Roi Kyanberu-taisa?) is best known as the original executive officer and the second commanding officer of FOXHOUND. He is one of Solid Snake's closest friends, and uncle of Meryl Silverburgh, although they later discovered that he is actually her biological father.

San Hieronymo TakeoverMain Article 

In 1970, Roy Campbell served in the Marine Corps, the Green Berets and Delta Force. Shortly after the FOX unit rebelled and took over the San Hieronymo Missile Base with threats to launch a top secret weapon into what was believed to be the Soviet Union, he and a squad of Green Berets were dispatched by Fort Bragg into Colombia to investigate why the San Hieronymo Base was being built. The FOX unit anticipated their arrival and ambushed them, murdered his entire squad and took him prisoner, leaving himself the sole survivor. He became involved in the downfall of the original FOX unit in 1970, where he met Big Boss in a prison at the San Hieronymo Peninsula, and the two joined forces to bring down FOX (lead by Gene). Unfortunately, at the time, Campbell had a broken leg and was unable to support Big Boss outside of driving a stolen enemy van between mission sites. Also, early on in the mission, he was diagnosed with Malaria and a significant part of the mission was to try and find medication for the Malaria strand that Campbell has, so as to save not only him, but the entire unit. Recruiting members of the Red Army who were stationed at the base over to their side, they discovered the truth behind FOX's revolt and destroyed their secret weapon of the Intercontinental Ballistic Metal Gear, as well as destroying Metal Gear RAXA, ICBMG's test model. Shortly after the end of the Mission, Roy Campbell had to endure a lot of time at the Hospital due to his broken leg, including having to endure an annoying nurse. 

[edit] Post-San HieronymoA year later, Big Boss and Campbell officially set up FOXHOUND. Campbell served as a tactician and executive officer. During this time, Campbell had an affair with the wife of his brother (Matt Campbell) and from this his daughter Meryl was born. It is unknown whether Matt ever found out that he was not really Meryl's father, but Campbell eventually found out at least a day before the Shadow Moses Incident, and planned to tell Meryl after the operation was over. 

Many years later, after Big Boss was discovered to be the leader of Outer Heaven and was defeated by rookie FOXHOUND operative Solid Snake, Campbell was appointed as commander of FOXHOUND and began revising FOXHOUND's methods with his personal touch. He discarded the codename system and adopted the use of high-tech equipment such as radars and spy satellites. 

[edit] Zanzibar Land DisturbanceSee Main Article 

Campbell brought out former FOXHOUND agent Solid Snake during the Zanzibar Land Disturbance and served as his commanding officer during Operation Intrude F014 in 1999. With his supervision, Snake was able to defeat the forces of Zanzibar Land and retrieve the OILIX formula. 

In the following year, Campbell retired as FOXHOUND commander for undisclosed reasons, although it is believed he was unhappy with the direction the unit was taking. 

[edit] Shadow Moses IncidentMain Article 

 
Roy Campbell In 2005, Campbell was called back to action by the US Government when FOXHOUND, now led by Liquid Snake, took over a nuclear disposal facility and held several people hostages, including Meryl Silverburgh, who was assigned to the disposal facility on the day of the takeover. Campbell once again brought Snake out of retirement to neutralize the new FOXHOUND, although the way he decided to bring Snake out of retirement both confused and annoyed Snake, as he did it in a way that made it seem as though black ops were hired to kill/capture him. However, during the course of the mission, Campbell was forced to keep a lot of secrets from Snake, including the true purpose of his mission and his injection with FOXDIE by Naomi Hunter, in order to ensure the safety of Meryl (the Pentagon had deliberately sent her to Shadow Moses on the same day as a bargaining chip to ensure his cooperation). Eventually, Campbell revealed the truth at the end of the mission and tried to call off an air strike directed to the base, but was arrested by Secretary of Defense Jim Houseman. However, while he was imprisoned, he managed to somehow contact President Sears and tell him about the air strike, thus resulting in Jim Houseman being arrested for going out of line. After Snake defeated Liquid, Campbell was exonerated from charges, as blame was laid on Houseman instead. 

After the events of Shadow Moses Incident, Campbell continued with his retirement. He later revealed to Meryl that he is really her father. 

[edit] The Manhattan IncidentSee the Tanker Incident and the Big Shell Incident 
Colonel Roy Campbell (ロイ・キャンベル大佐, Roi Kyanberu-taisa?) is best known as the original executive officer and the second commanding officer of FOXHOUND. He is one of Solid Snake's closest friends, and uncle of Meryl Silverburgh, although they later discovered that he is actually her biological father.
In 2009, a man resembling Roy Campbell served as Raiden's commanding officer during the Big Shell Incident lead by Solidus Snake. However, this Colonel was later revealed to be an artificial construct created by the Patriots and generated by GW, the supercomputer of Arsenal Gear. Sometime after the Big Shell Incident, Raiden and Campbell actually physically met, with Campbell taking on a sort of &quot;commanding officer&quot; role in Raiden's life. Campbell and Rosemary devised a plan to protect Raiden and Rose's son. They broke all ties to Raiden, who had disappeared into the Alaskan wilderness, and pretended to marry. Campbell played out his new life to the fullest, not even being able to tell his own daughter Meryl the truth. 

[edit] Liquid Ocelot's InsurrectionSee Liquid Sun, Solid Sun, Third Sun, Twin Suns, Old Sun, and Naked Sin 

In 2014, Campbell, now working for a counter-terrorism branch of the United Nations, contacted his old friend Solid Snake, along with his partner Hal Emmerich, after he had discovered the whereabouts of the long missing Liquid Ocelot. Not content with the UN and other governments simply ignoring Liquid's attempt to plunge the world into total war, in effect aiding the economy of the 21st Century, Campbell took the matter into his own hands and hired Snake to perform an assassination. Upon reaching the Middle East, Snake met up with Meryl, Campbell's daughter, who revealed to Snake that Campbell had remarried to Rosemary and she was no longer speaking with &quot;that womanizing piece of shit&quot;. Campbell was visibly upset when Snake divulged his daughter's opinion of him, but Campbell had to keep the secret that his marriage to Rosemary was a lie up until Raiden was done with his mission in order to protect John. 

At the end of the mission, Campbell attends Meryl's wedding to Johnny Sasaki, finally making amends with her after years of deceit and not speaking. He congratulated Meryl for getting married but she ignored him. Campbell began to walk away before Meryl pulled her Desert Eagle from her holster. He then returned to her, putting himself point-blank near the muzzle, and then pulling it to his own neck. She then released the clip, forcefully telling him, &quot;You're going to walk me down the aisle.&quot; Campbell laughed and told Meryl that finally, they had plenty of time to get to know each other. Campbell remarked how beautiful Meryl looked, making both her and Mei Ling, Meryl's bridesmaid, break down in tears. 

TriviaRoy Campbell's frequency is the same as Major Zero's frequency 140.85. 
Despite his injuries during the San Hieronymo Incident, there were a few occasions in which he was able to stand up and move around in a limited manner, implying that his leg was broken only to the extent of slowing him down. 
During Liquid Ocelot's Insurrection, Meryl tells Snake that Campbell was married at least once before. 
Roy Campbell was somewhat aware of the Patriots's existence prior to the Shadow Moses Incident, as he began to suspect their involvement in said event during Snake's mission.[4] 
edit Behind the ScenesCampbell was originally modeled after the likeness of actor Richard Crenna from the Rambo films, in which he played Colonel Trautman. 
Campbell has appeared in some form or another in all but two games in the series. The only games in which Campbell has not appeared in is Metal Gear, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker. Only his likeness appeared in Metal Gear Solid 2. However, it turned out to be an elaborate deception. 
Campbell reveals to Snake that Meryl is his biological daughter in two non-canonical events: the Otacon ending of MGS and the stamina kill ending of Snake Tale C in Substance. 
edit Gameplay[edit] Metal Gear seriesDuring the Time Paradox continue screen in Metal Gear Solid 3, Campbell's voice can be heard chastizing Snake's carelessness. 

Campbell, along with Solid Snake, makes a cameo appearance in the Snake vs. Monkey minigame that is included in Metal Gear Solid 3. The Colonel briefs Snake about his newest mission to catch experimental mechanical monkeys, much to Snake's dismay, who responds angrily that Campbell could have gotten someone else to do the job and frustrated that he had to be brought out during vacation. Campbell then explains that Otacon has connections with the person who is involved with the monkeys and it was Otacon who recommended Snake. 

In Portable Ops, the young Roy Campbell wears camouflage clothes, which exactly resemble the Tiger Stripe camo in Metal Gear Solid 3. If Snake attempts to contact Campbell a few times during a mission, he will sometimes give Snake hints on how to get a girl. If the player controls a recruit, he also talks about how he and his brother were in love with the same woman (which may be Meryl's mother) but insists that she didn't dump him. Because of his physical and medical status during the San Hieronymo Takeover, Campbell is the only main character in Portable Ops who is not playable in the main game (he is, however, playable in the expansion, Portable Ops Plus). 

[edit] Super Smash Bros. BrawlRoy Campbell is among one of three Metal Gear characters (the others being Mei Ling and Hal &quot;Otacon&quot; Emmerich) who make a non-canonical appearance in and give Solid Snake advice and detailed background regarding his opponents via codec (a hidden taunt; one of Snake's many easter eggs). 

If Snake's opponent is Luigi, his AI clone takes his place and bombards Luigi with verbal insults rather than providing Snake with relevant and needed information. To this, a sudden role reversal occurs, in which Snake yells out for Campbell to &quot;snap out of it&quot; in the Game Over fashion. Also, as Snake tries to give credit to Luigi's efforts in the field of battle, Campbell rambles the phrase &quot;La-li-lu-le-lo!&quot; repeatedly. 

Campbell also appears in the game's E3 trailer in 2006, contacting Snake's codec and informing him of an invitation to participate in the upcoming Smash Bros. installment, to which Snake simply replies that he is performing a reconnaissance operation, investigating a battle between Kirby, Link, Pikachu and Mario through his trademark box.

&quot;Nothing has been done through the usual channels, including the way Richard Ames induced Snake and I to cooperate. This mission isn't even official business, is it? So who else can mount such a major operation...&quot; Campbell suddenly broke off, as though struck by something. &quot;Is it possible that -- the Patriots?&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Installation==

There are two ways to install &lt;code&gt;MediaWiki::Bot&lt;/code&gt;.

===Using CPAN shell (recommended)===
If you use the CPAN shell to install MediaWiki::Bot, the entire process is automated:

    user@host:~$ sudo -i
    root@host:~# cpan
    cpan&gt; install MediaWiki::Bot
    ...

You might have CPAN configured such that you don't need to become root initially.

===Manual===
Otherwise, you can install it manually. First install the dependencies (listed below), then install MediaWiki::Bot. To install this module type the following in the root directory or a checkout from SVN or an unpacked tarball:

   user@host:~$ perl Makefile.PL
   user@host:~$ make
   user@host:~$ make test
   user@host:~$ sudo make install

You might use other methods to become root instead of sudo.

The test scripts included with &lt;code&gt;MediaWiki::Bot&lt;/code&gt; require a working internet connection. If the test suite fails,
it might be safe to install the module anyway. When in doubt, email {{email|perlwikibot|googlegroups.com}} with the complete output of the test suite and ask for advice.

===Dependencies===

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

* &lt;code&gt;WWW::Mechanize&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;HTML::Entities&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;URI::Escape&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;XML::Simple&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Carp&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Encode&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;MediaWiki::API&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Module::Pluggable&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Crypt::SSLeay&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Digest::MD5&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''register''' keyword is a request to the compiler that the specified variable is to be stored in a register of the processor instead of memory as a way to gain speed, mostly because it will be heavily used. &lt;u&gt;The compiler may ignore the request&lt;/u&gt;.

The keyword fell out of common use when compilers became better at most code optimizations than humans. Any valid program that uses the keyword will be semantically identical to one without it, unless they appear in a stringized macro (or similar context), where it can be useful to ensure that improper usage of the macro will cause a compile-time error. This keywords relates closely to &lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt;. 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
register int x=99;
&lt;/source&gt;

{{NOTE|Register has different semantics between C and C++. In C it is possible to forbid the array-to-pointer conversion by making an array register declaration: &lt;code&gt;register int a[1];&lt;/code&gt;.}}

==Book Layout has to improve==
This book is a monster book and the amount of work that has undergone is extraordinary and it shows. I feel though that the book is very very large and the layout of the book has to improve. I think we have to make different pages for each subject/chapter and remove the subpages from the front page (for instance, in the 'medicine &amp; drug design' section we can move all the listed drugs in the 'medicine &amp; drug design' page rather than having such a long list in the front page). We can do the same for the other subjects/chapters. It is definately one of the largest books in here and it is very well written but we have to make it like a book not like an encyclopedic-index book. 

For example:

  Table of contents?!:
  *Structural Biochemistry in relation to other sciences
  **Physics
  **Chemistry
  **Biology
  ***Evolution
  ***The cell
  ***Genetics
  ***Biology of Cancer
  **Medicine and Drug Design
  **Neuroscience
  **Systems Biology
  **Bioinformatics
  **Molecular Modeling
  *Water
  *Proteins
  *Carbohydrates
  *Lipids
  *Nucleic Acids
  *Catalysis

All subsections will appear in the corresponding chapters/sections.

What do you think? [[User:U1012738|U1012738]] ([[User talk:U1012738|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/U1012738|contribs]]) 18:08, 1 December 2012 (UTC)

== Addition to vitamin C ==

Vitamin C's name was given to this molecule in early days. Around 1920, Casimir Funk had introduced the term Vitamin C that is necessary and one of the nutritional factor for a pathological state known as scurvy and at time the nature of the active molecule was still unknown.

Biochemical role of Vitamin C
It was said that l-lguolonolactone oxidase which is the last enzyme in ASC biosynthetic pathway made primates primates(including humans), geinea pigs and a few other animal species unable to synthesize ASC. Loss of ASC synthesis could have increased the rate of mutation and consequent change in genetic variablity which might have led into evolution. Many authors suggested that the dietary intake of vitamin C present in fruit and vegetables was enough to compensate for missing or less of synthesis. Also hydrogen peroxide is generated  in reaction catalyzed by l-guolonolactone oxi-dase.
Scurvy is a pathological state caused by ASC deficiency.
Both ASC deficiency and low expression of prolyl hydroxylase due to inherited defects or gene manipulation, converge to the same result.
Collagen being the most abundant protein in animals, consumes large ASC amounts for hydroxylation conceivably, which leads into explaining why collagen malfunctioning is the most evident sign of scurvy. It's not just this, ASC and oxidized form dehydroascorbate are protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum, have deficiency affects.
Carnitine is an essential metabolite having an indispensable role in energy metabolism. ASC deficiency also affects carnitine synthesis.</text>

that's all if you need to know more about me just send me a message I will write you back 
if it late probably I have got an assignment do or video game to play. :D
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I Interesting about &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ol type='1'&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software Developing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CGI Works like Photshops and 3D Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer Games especially PC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astronomy and outer space and Aliens and new planets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History I meant little bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traveling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer Hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I contest that the need of state (and in practice use) a &quot;large amount of water&quot; should be removed, as having no value to the recipe and promote in general a bad practice.  I never use large amounts of water. This is a response to [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook%3ASpaghetti_alla_Puttanesca&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=1886010&amp;oldid=1885970 Thenub314 reversal of my edit].
This article [http://curiouscook.com/cook/other_writings_detail.php?id=44 How Much Water Does Pasta Really Need?] cover the issue.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:42, 12 July 2010 (UTC)

:Well probably not surprisingly since I reverted the edit I disagree.  This is an interesting blog entry, but it is far from convincing, particularly where one of the chefs mentions that his method, which includes starting off with cold water, leads to a poorer quality of  texture.  I would personally find Fine Cooking [http://www.finecooking.com/articles/cooking-pasta-properly.aspx Fine Cooking] to be a more reputable source.  But either way, I have a compromise to suggest.  The chef mentioned in the article above, as well as the fine cooking website seem to feel that 4 quarts of water per pound of pasta is a minimum.  Why don't we put this amount in explicitly? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 20:32, 12 July 2010 (UTC)

::I don't object to stating a defined amount. I only expressed an objection to undefined statement of a &quot;large amount of water&quot;. When I cook pasta I use boiling water and then put the pasta vertically in the water and as it softens and loses rigidity it is completely submerged, even if I realize that there are other methods, this one makes it also easier to determine when the pasta is [[w:al dente|al dente]] and is more economic, even taking less time. I also prefer to keep the pasta in its original size, some people prefer to break it in half or prefer it more cooked and without any residence to the byte, to me this removes any taste from the pasta.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:56, 12 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

:[[Image:Op-Amp Comparator.svg|200px]]

Compares two voltages and switches its output to indicate which voltage is larger. 
*&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = \left\{\begin{matrix} V_{\text{S+}} &amp; V_1 &gt; V_2 \\ V_{\text{S-}} &amp; V_1 &lt; V_2 \end{matrix}\right. &lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{s}}&lt;/math&gt; is the supply voltage and the opamp is powered by &lt;math&gt;+V_{\text{s}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-V_{\text{s}}&lt;/math&gt;.)

=== Inverting amplifier ===

[[Image:Op-Amp Inverting Amplifier.svg|300px]]

An inverting amplifier uses negative feedback to invert and [[amplifier|amplify]] a voltage. The R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; resistor allows some of the output signal to be returned to the input.  Since the output is 180° out of phase, this  amount is effectively subtracted from the input, thereby reducing the input into the operational amplifier.  This reduces the overall gain of the amplifier and is dubbed negative feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Basic Electronics Theory, Delton T. Horn, 4th ed. McGraw-Hill Professional, 1994, p.342-343.&lt;/ref&gt;  

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = -\frac{R_{\text{f}}}{R_{\text{in}}} V_{\text{in}}\!\ &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}} = R_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; (because &lt;math&gt;V_-&lt;/math&gt; is a [[virtual ground]])
* A third resistor, of value &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{f}} \| R_{\text{in}} \triangleq R_{\text{f}} R_{\text{in}} / (R_{\text{f}} + R_{\text{in}}) &lt;/math&gt;, added between the non-inverting input and ground, while not necessary, minimizes errors due to input bias currents.&lt;ref&gt;Malmstadt, Enke and Crouch, Electronics and Instrumentation for Scientists, The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., 1981, ISBN 0-8053-6917-1, Chapter 5. pp 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gain of the amplifier is determined by the ratio of R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; to R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;.  That is:

&lt;math&gt;A = -\frac{R_f}{R_{in}}&lt;/math&gt;

The presence of the negative sign is a convention indicating that the output is inverted.  For example, if  R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is 10 000 Ω and R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; is 1 000 Ω, then the gain would be -10 000Ω/1 000Ω, which is -10.

=== Non-inverting amplifier{{anchor|Non-inverting amplifier configuration}}===

[[Image:Op-Amp Non-Inverting Amplifier.svg|300px]]

Amplifies a voltage (multiplies by a constant greater than 1)

:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = V_{\text{in}} \left( 1 + \frac{R_2}{R_1} \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
* Input impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}} \approx \infin&lt;/math&gt; 
** The input impedance is ''at least'' the impedance between non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) and inverting (&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;) inputs, which is typically 1 MΩ to 10 TΩ, plus the impedance of the path from the inverting (&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;) input to ground (i.e., &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; in parallel with &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;).
** Because negative feedback ensures that the non-inverting and inverting inputs match, the input impedance is actually '''much higher.'''
* Although this circuit has a large input impedance, it suffers from error of input bias current.
** The non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) and inverting (&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;) inputs draw small leakage currents into the operational amplifier.
** These input currents generate voltages that act like unmodeled input offsets. These unmodeled effects can lead to noise on the output (e.g., offsets or drift).
** Assuming that the two leaking currents are '''matched,''' their effect can be mitigated by ensuring the DC impedance looking '''out''' of each input is the same.
*** The voltage produced by each bias current is equal to the product of the bias current with the equivalent DC impedance looking out of each input. Making those impedances equal makes the offset voltage at each input equal, and so the non-zero bias currents will have no impact on the '''difference''' between the two inputs.
*** A resistor of value
***:&lt;math&gt;R_1 \| R_2 \triangleq \left(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}\right)^{-1} = \frac{ R_1 R_2 }{ R_1 + R_2 },\,&lt;/math&gt;
**:which is the equivalent resistance of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; in parallel with &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, between the &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; source and the non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) input will ensure the impedances looking '''out''' of each input will be matched.
*** The matched bias currents will then generate matched offset voltages, and their effect will be hidden to the operational amplifier (which acts on the difference between its inputs) so long as the [[common-mode rejection ratio|CMRR]] is good.
** Very often, the input currents are ''not'' matched.
*** Most operational amplifiers provide some method of balancing the two input currents (e.g., by way of an external [[potentiometer]]).
*** Alternatively, an external offset can be added to the operational amplifier input to nullify the effect.
*** Another solution is to insert a variable resistor between the &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; source and the non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) input. The resistance can be tuned until the offset voltages at each input are matched.
*** Operational amplifiers with [[MOSFET]]-based input stages have input currents that are so small that they often can be neglected.

=== Differential amplifier ===

[[Image:Op-Amp Differential Amplifier.svg|300px]]

{{main|Differential amplifier}}

The circuit shown is used for finding the [[subtraction|difference]] of two voltages each multiplied by some constant (determined by the resistors). 

''The name &quot;differential amplifier&quot; should not be confused with the &quot;[[#Differentiator|differentiator]]&quot;, also shown on this page.''

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = \frac{ \left( R_{\text{f}} + R_1 \right) R_{\text{g}} }{\left( R_{\text{g}} + R_2 \right) R_1} V_2 - \frac{R_{\text{f}}}{R_1} V_1 &lt;/math&gt;

* Differential &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; (between the two input pins) = &lt;math&gt;R_1 + R_2&lt;/math&gt; (Note: this is approximate)

For common-mode rejection, anything done to one input must be done to the other.  The addition of a compensation capacitor in parallel with Rf, for instance, must be balanced by an equivalent capacitor in parallel with Rg.

''The &quot;[[#Instrumentation amplifier|instrumentation amplifier]]&quot;, which is also shown on this page, is another form of differential amplifier that also provides high [[input impedance]].''

Whenever &lt;math&gt;R_1 = R_2\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{f}} = R_{\text{g}}\,&lt;/math&gt;, the differential gain is
:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = A (V_{\text{2}} - V_{\text{1}})\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;A \triangleq \frac{ R_{\text{f}} }{ R_1 }&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;R_1 = R_\mathrm{f}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2 = R_\mathrm{g}\,&lt;/math&gt; the differential gain is A = 1 and the circuit acts as a differential follower:

:&lt;math&gt; V_\mathrm{out} =  V_2 - V_1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

{{clear}}

=== Voltage follower ===

[[Image:Op-Amp Unity-Gain Buffer.svg|200px]]

Used as a [[buffer amplifier]] to eliminate loading effects (e.g., connecting a device with a high [[source impedance]] to a device with a low [[input impedance]]). 

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = V_{\text{in}} \!\ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}} = \infty&lt;/math&gt; (realistically, the differential input impedance of the op-amp itself, 1 MΩ to 1 TΩ)

Due to the strong (i.e., [[unity (mathematics)|unity]] gain) feedback and certain non-ideal characteristics of real operational amplifiers, this feedback system is prone to have poor [[phase margin|stability margin]]s. Consequently, the system may be [[BIBO stability|unstable]] when connected to sufficiently capacitive loads. In these cases, a [[frequency compensation|lag compensation]] network (e.g., connecting the load to the voltage follower through a resistor) can be used to restore stability. The manufacturer [[data sheet]] for the operational amplifier may provide guidance for the selection of components in external compensation networks. Alternatively, another operational amplifier can be chosen that has more appropriate internal compensation.

{{clear}}

=== Summing amplifier ===
[[Image:Op-Amp Summing Amplifier.svg|left|200px]]




















A summing amplifer sums several (weighted) voltages:

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = -R_{\text{f}} \left( \frac{V_1}{R_1} + \frac{V_2}{R_2} + \cdots + \frac{V_n}{R_n} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

* When &lt;math&gt;R_1 = R_2 = \cdots = R_n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{f}}&lt;/math&gt; independent

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = -\frac{R_{\text{f}}}{R_1} ( V_1 + V_2 + \cdots + V_n ) \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

* When &lt;math&gt;R_1 = R_2 = \cdots = R_n = R_{\text{f}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = -( V_1 + V_2 + \cdots + V_n ) \!\ &lt;/math&gt; 
* Output is inverted
* Input impedance of the '''''n''th''' input is &lt;math&gt;Z_n = R_n&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;V_-&lt;/math&gt; is a [[virtual ground]])

{{clear}}

=== Inverting integrator ===

[[Image:Op-Amp Integrating Amplifier.svg|300px|]]

[[Integral|Integrates]] the (inverted) signal over time

:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = -\int_0^t \frac{ V_{\text{in}} }{RC} \, \operatorname{d}t + V_{\text{initial}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}}&lt;/math&gt; are functions of time, &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{initial}}&lt;/math&gt; is the output voltage of the integrator at time ''t'' = 0.)

* Note that this can also be viewed as a [[Low-pass filter|low-pass]] [[electronic filter]]. It is a filter with a single [[complex pole|pole]] at DC (i.e., where &lt;math&gt;\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;) and gain.
* There are several potential problems with this circuit.
** It is usually assumed that the input &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; has zero DC component (i.e., has a zero average value). Otherwise, unless the capacitor is periodically discharged, the output will drift outside of the operational amplifier's operating range.
** Even when &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; has no offset, the leakage or bias currents into the operational amplifier inputs can add an unexpected offset voltage to &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; that causes the output to drift. Balancing input currents '''and''' replacing the non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) short-circuit to ground with a resistor with resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; can reduce the severity of this problem.
** Because this circuit provides no DC feedback (i.e., the capacitor appears like an open circuit to signals with &lt;math&gt;\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;), the offset of the output may not agree with expectations (i.e., &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{initial}}&lt;/math&gt; may be out of the designer's control with the present circuit). 
: Many of these problems can be made less severe by adding a ''large'' resistor &lt;math&gt;R_F&lt;/math&gt; in parallel with the feedback capacitor. At significantly high frequencies, this resistor will have negligible effect. However, at low frequencies where there are drift and offset problems, the resistor provides the necessary feedback to hold the output steady at the correct value. In effect, this resistor reduces the DC gain of the &quot;integrator&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; it goes from infinite to some finite value &lt;math&gt;R_F/R&lt;/math&gt;.

{{clear}}

=== Inverting differentiator ===

[[Image:Op-Amp Differentiating Amplifier.svg|300px]]

[[Derivative|Differentiates]] the (inverted) signal over time.  

:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = -RC \,\frac{\operatorname{d}V_{\text{in}} }{ \operatorname{d}t} \, \qquad \text{where } V_{\text{in}}\text{ and } V_{\text{out}} \text{ are functions of time.}&lt;/math&gt;

* Note that this can also be viewed as a [[High-pass filter|high-pass]] [[electronic filter]]. It is a filter with a single [[complex zero|zero]] at DC (i.e., where &lt;math&gt;\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;) and gain. The high pass characteristics of a differentiating amplifier can lead to unstable behavior when the circuit is used in an analog servo loop.  For this reason the system function would be re-formulated to use integrators.

{{clear}}

=== Instrumentation amplifier ===

[[Image:Op-Amp Instrumentation Amplifier.svg|300px]]

{{main|Instrumentation amplifier}}

Combines very high [[input impedance]], high [[common-mode rejection]], low [[DC offset]], and other properties used in making very accurate, low-noise measurements

* Is made by adding a [[#Non-inverting amplifier|non-inverting]] [[buffer amplifier|buffer]] to each input of the [[#Differential amplifier|differential amplifier]] to increase the input impedance.

{{clear}}

=== Schmitt trigger ===

{{main|Schmitt trigger}}

A [[bistable multivibrator]] implemented as a [[comparator]] with [[hysteresis]].

{{clear}}

[[Image:Op-Amp Schmitt Trigger.svg|300px]]

In this configuration, the input voltage is applied through the resistor &lt;math&gt;{R_1}&lt;/math&gt; (which may be the source internal resistance) to the non-inverting input and the inverting input is grounded or referenced. The hysteresis curve is non-inverting and the switching thresholds are &lt;math&gt;\pm \frac{R_1}{R_2}V_{\text{sat}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{sat}}&lt;/math&gt; is the greatest output magnitude of the operational amplifier.

{{clear}}

[[File:Op-Amp Inverting Schmitt Trigger.svg|300px]]




Alternatively, the input source and the [[electrical ground|ground]] may be swapped. Now the input voltage is applied directly to the inverting input and the non-inverting input is grounded or referenced. The hysteresis curve is inverting and the switching thresholds are &lt;math&gt;\pm \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2} V_{\text{sat}}&lt;/math&gt;. Such a configuration is used in the [[#Relaxation_oscillator|relaxation oscillator]] shown below.

{{clear}}

=== Relaxation oscillator ===

{{main|Relaxation oscillator}}

[[File:Op-Amp Relaxation Oscillator.svg|300px]]







By using an [[RC network]] to add slow [[negative feedback]] to the inverting [[#Schmitt_trigger|Schmitt trigger]], a [[relaxation oscillator]] is formed. The feedback through the RC network causes the Schmitt trigger output to [[oscillate]] in an endless symmetric [[square wave]] (i.e., the Schmitt trigger in this configuration is an [[astable multivibrator]]).

{{clear}}

=== Inductance gyrator ===

[[Image:Op-Amp Gyrator.svg|300px]]

{{main|Gyrator}}

Simulates an [[inductor]] (i.e., provides [[inductance]] without the use of a possibly costly inductor). The circuit exploits the fact that the current flowing through a capacitor behaves through time as the voltage across an inductor. The capacitor used in this circuit is smaller than the inductor it simulates and its capacitance is less subject to changes in value due to environmental changes.

This circuit is unsuitable for applications relying on the [[back EMF]] property of an inductor as this will be limited in a gyrator circuit to the voltage supplies of the op-amp.

{{clear}}

=== Zero level detector ===
&lt;!-- fig needed here? --&gt;

Voltage divider reference

* Zener sets reference voltage.
* Acts as a comparator with one input tied to ground.
* When input is at zero, op-amp output is zero (assuming split supplies.)

=== Negative impedance converter (NIC) ===

[[Image:Op-Amp Negative Impedance Converter.svg|300px]]

{{main|Negative impedance converter}}

Creates a [[resistor]] having a negative value for any signal generator

* In this case, the ratio between the input voltage and the input current (thus the input resistance) is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\text{in}} = -R_3 \frac{R_1}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the components &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt; need not be resistors; they can be any component that can be described with an [[Electrical impedance|impedance]].

{{clear}}

=== Wien bridge oscillator ===

[[File:Wien bridge classic osc.svg|300px]]

{{main|Wien bridge oscillator}}

Produces a very low distortion [[sine wave]]. Uses negative temperature compensation in the form of a light bulb or diode.

{{clear}}

=== Precision rectifier ===

[[Image:Op-Amp Precision Rectifier.svg|250px|]]

{{main|Precision rectifier}}

The voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; across the forward biased diode in the circuit of a passive rectifier is undesired. In this active version, the problem is solved by connecting the diode in the negative feedback loop. The op-amp compares the output voltage across the load with the input voltage and increases its own output voltage with the value of V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is compensated and the circuit behaves very nearly as an ideal (''super'') [[diode]] with V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 V. 

The circuit has speed limitations at high frequency because of the slow negative feedback and due to the low slew rate of many non-ideal op-amps.

{{clear}}

=== Logarithmic output ===
{{See also|Log amplifier}}
[[Image:Op-Amp Logarithmic Amplifier.svg|300px]]

* The relationship between the input voltage &lt;math&gt;v_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; and the output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_{\text{out}}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;v_{\text{out}} = -V_{\text{T}} \ln \left( \frac{v_{\text{in}}}{I_{\text{S}} \, R} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{S}}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''saturation current'' and &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{T}}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''thermal voltage''.

* If the operational amplifier is considered ideal, the negative pin is virtually grounded, so the current flowing into the resistor from the source (and thus through the diode to the output, since the op-amp inputs draw no current) is:

where &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{S}}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''saturation current'' and &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{T}}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''thermal voltage''.

* Considering the operational amplifier ideal, then the negative pin is virtually grounded, so the current through the diode is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;I_{\text{D}} = I_{\text{S}} \left( e^{\frac{V_{\text{D}}}{V_{\text{T}}}} - 1 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

when the voltage is greater than zero, it can be approximated by:

:&lt;math&gt;I_{\text{D}} \simeq I_{\text{S}} e^{\frac{V_{\text{D}}}{V_{\text{T}}}}. &lt;/math&gt;

The output voltage is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;v_{\text{out}} = -R I_{\text{D}}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

| Inverting amplifier || [[File:Op-Amp Inverting Amplifier.svg|300px]] || An inverting amplifier uses negative feedback to invert and [[amplifier|amplify]] a voltage. The R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; resistor allows some of the output signal to be returned to the input. Since the output is 180° out of phase, this amount is effectively subtracted from the input, thereby reducing the input into the operational amplifier. This reduces the overall gain of the amplifier and is dubbed negative feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Basic Electronics Theory, Delton T. Horn, 4th ed. McGraw-Hill Professional, 1994, p.342-343.&lt;/ref&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = -\frac{R_{\text{f}}}{R_{\text{in}}} V_{\text{in}}\!\ &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}} = R_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; (because &lt;math&gt;V_-&lt;/math&gt; is a [[virtual ground]])
* A third resistor, of value &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{f}} \| R_{\text{in}} \triangleq R_{\text{f}} R_{\text{in}} / (R_{\text{f}} + R_{\text{in}}) &lt;/math&gt;, added between the non-inverting input and ground, while not necessary, minimizes errors due to input bias currents.&lt;ref&gt;Malmstadt, Enke and Crouch, Electronics and Instrumentation for Scientists, The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., 1981, ISBN 0-8053-6917-1, Chapter 5. pp 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gain of the amplifier is determined by the ratio of R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; to R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;. That is:

&lt;math&gt;A = -\frac{R_f}{R_{in}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Non-inverting amplifier || [[File:Op-Amp Non-Inverting Amplifier.svg|300px]] ||

Amplifies a voltage (multiplies by a constant greater than 1)

:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = V_{\text{in}} \left( 1 + \frac{R_2}{R_1} \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
* Input impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}} \approx \infin&lt;/math&gt; 
** The input impedance is ''at least'' the impedance between non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) and inverting (&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;) inputs, which is typically 1 MΩ to 10 TΩ, plus the impedance of the path from the inverting (&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;) input to ground (i.e., &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; in parallel with &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;).
** Because negative feedback ensures that the non-inverting and inverting inputs match, the input impedance is actually '''much higher.'''
* Although this circuit has a large input impedance, it suffers from error of input bias current.
** The non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) and inverting (&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;) inputs draw small leakage currents into the operational amplifier.
** These input currents generate voltages that act like unmodeled input offsets. These unmodeled effects can lead to noise on the output (e.g., offsets or drift).
** Assuming that the two leaking currents are '''matched,''' their effect can be mitigated by ensuring the DC impedance looking '''out''' of each input is the same.
*** The voltage produced by each bias current is equal to the product of the bias current with the equivalent DC impedance looking out of each input. Making those impedances equal makes the offset voltage at each input equal, and so the non-zero bias currents will have no impact on the '''difference''' between the two inputs.
*** A resistor of value
***: &lt;math&gt;R_1 \| R_2 \triangleq \left(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}\right)^{-1} = \frac{ R_1 R_2 }{ R_1 + R_2 },\,&lt;/math&gt;
**: which is the equivalent resistance of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; in parallel with &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, between the &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; source and the non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) input will ensure the impedances looking '''out''' of each input will be matched.
*** The matched bias currents will then generate matched offset voltages, and their effect will be hidden to the operational amplifier (which acts on the difference between its inputs) so long as the [[common-mode rejection ratio|CMRR]] is good.
** Very often, the input currents are ''not'' matched.
*** Most operational amplifiers provide some method of balancing the two input currents (e.g., by way of an external [[potentiometer]]).
*** Alternatively, an external offset can be added to the operational amplifier input to nullify the effect.
*** Another solution is to insert a variable resistor between the &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; source and the non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) input. The resistance can be tuned until the offset voltages at each input are matched.
*** Operational amplifiers with [[MOSFET]]-based input stages have input currents that are so small that they often can be neglected.

| Differential amplifier || [[File:Op-Amp Differential Amplifier.svg|300px]] || The circuit shown is used for finding the [[subtraction|difference]] of two voltages each multiplied by some constant (determined by the resistors). 

''The name &quot;differential amplifier&quot; should not be confused with the &quot;[[#Differentiator|differentiator]]&quot;, also shown on this page.''

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = \frac{ \left( R_{\text{f}} + R_1 \right) R_{\text{g}} }{\left( R_{\text{g}} + R_2 \right) R_1} V_2 - \frac{R_{\text{f}}}{R_1} V_1 &lt;/math&gt;

* Differential &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; (between the two input pins) = &lt;math&gt;R_1 + R_2&lt;/math&gt; (Note: this is approximate)

For common-mode rejection, anything done to one input must be done to the other. The addition of a compensation capacitor in parallel with Rf, for instance, must be balanced by an equivalent capacitor in parallel with Rg.

''The &quot;[[#Instrumentation amplifier|instrumentation amplifier]]&quot;, which is also shown on this page, is another form of differential amplifier that also provides high [[input impedance]].''

Whenever &lt;math&gt;R_1 = R_2\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{f}} = R_{\text{g}}\,&lt;/math&gt;, the differential gain is
:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = A (V_{\text{2}} - V_{\text{1}})\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;A \triangleq \frac{ R_{\text{f}} }{ R_1 }&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;R_1 = R_\mathrm{f}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2 = R_\mathrm{g}\,&lt;/math&gt; the differential gain is A = 1 and the circuit acts as a differential follower:

:&lt;math&gt; V_\mathrm{out} =  V_2 - V_1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Voltage follower || [[File:Op-Amp Unity-Gain Buffer.svg|200px]] || Used as a [[buffer amplifier]] to eliminate loading effects (e.g., connecting a device with a high [[source impedance]] to a device with a low [[input impedance]]). 

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = V_{\text{in}} \!\ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}} = \infty&lt;/math&gt; (realistically, the differential input impedance of the op-amp itself, 1 MΩ to 1 TΩ)

Due to the strong (i.e., [[unity (mathematics)|unity]] gain) feedback and certain non-ideal characteristics of real operational amplifiers, this feedback system is prone to have poor [[phase margin|stability margins]]. Consequently, the system may be [[BIBO stability|unstable]] when connected to sufficiently capacitive loads. In these cases, a [[frequency compensation|lag compensation]] network (e.g., connecting the load to the voltage follower through a resistor) can be used to restore stability. The manufacturer [[data sheet]] for the operational amplifier may provide guidance for the selection of components in external compensation networks. Alternatively, another operational amplifier can be chosen that has more appropriate internal compensation.

|Inverting integrator || [[File:Op-Amp Integrating Amplifier.svg|300px|]] || [[Integral|Integrates]] the (inverted) signal over time

:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = -\int_0^t \frac{ V_{\text{in}} }{RC} \, \operatorname{d}t + V_{\text{initial}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}}&lt;/math&gt; are functions of time, &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{initial}}&lt;/math&gt; is the output voltage of the integrator at time ''t'' = 0.)

* Note that this can also be viewed as a [[Low-pass filter|low-pass]] [[electronic filter]]. It is a filter with a single [[complex pole|pole]] at DC (i.e., where &lt;math&gt;\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;) and gain.
* There are several potential problems with this circuit.
** It is usually assumed that the input &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; has zero DC component (i.e., has a zero average value). Otherwise, unless the capacitor is periodically discharged, the output will drift outside of the operational amplifier's operating range.
** Even when &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; has no offset, the leakage or bias currents into the operational amplifier inputs can add an unexpected offset voltage to &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; that causes the output to drift. Balancing input currents '''and''' replacing the non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) short-circuit to ground with a resistor with resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; can reduce the severity of this problem.
** Because this circuit provides no DC feedback (i.e., the capacitor appears like an open circuit to signals with &lt;math&gt;\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;), the offset of the output may not agree with expectations (i.e., &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{initial}}&lt;/math&gt; may be out of the designer's control with the present circuit). 
: Many of these problems can be made less severe by adding a ''large'' resistor &lt;math&gt;R_F&lt;/math&gt; in parallel with the feedback capacitor. At significantly high frequencies, this resistor will have negligible effect. However, at low frequencies where there are drift and offset problems, the resistor provides the necessary feedback to hold the output steady at the correct value. In effect, this resistor reduces the DC gain of the &quot;integrator&quot;&amp;nbsp;– it goes from infinite to some finite value &lt;math&gt;R_F/R&lt;/math&gt;.

* Note that this can also be viewed as a [[High-pass filter|high-pass]] [[electronic filter]]. It is a filter with a single [[complex zero|zero]] at DC (i.e., where &lt;math&gt;\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;) and gain. The high pass characteristics of a differentiating amplifier can lead to unstable behavior when the circuit is used in an analog servo loop. For this reason the system function would be re-formulated to use integrators.

The hysteresis curve is non-inverting and the switching thresholds are &lt;math&gt;\pm \frac{R_1}{R_2}V_{\text{sat}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{sat}}&lt;/math&gt; is the greatest output magnitude of the operational amplifier.

[[File:Op-Amp Inverting Schmitt Trigger.svg|300px]]

Alternatively, the input source and the [[electrical ground|ground]] may be swapped. Now the input voltage is applied directly to the inverting input and the non-inverting input is grounded or referenced. The hysteresis curve is inverting and the switching thresholds are &lt;math&gt;\pm \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2} V_{\text{sat}}&lt;/math&gt;. Such a configuration is used in the [[#Relaxation_oscillator|relaxation oscillator]] shown below.

|Inductance gyrator || [[File:Op-Amp Gyrator.svg|300px]] || Simulates an [[inductor]] (i.e., provides [[inductance]] without the use of a possibly costly inductor). The circuit exploits the fact that the current flowing through a capacitor behaves through time as the voltage across an inductor. The capacitor used in this circuit is smaller than the inductor it simulates and its capacitance is less subject to changes in value due to environmental changes.

This circuit is unsuitable for applications relying on the [[back EMF]] property of an inductor as this will be limited in a gyrator circuit to the voltage supplies of the op-amp.

As a result, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is compensated and the circuit behaves very nearly as an ideal (''super'') [[diode]] with V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 V. 

The circuit has speed limitations at high frequency because of the slow negative feedback and due to the low slew rate of many non-ideal op-amps.

Moving water does much of the work of erosion that shapes the land surface of our Earth. Wind also flows over the Earth's surface, sometimes carrying particles long distances before they are deposited. Wind blows from areas of high pressure to areas of lower pressure. The erosive power of wind varies with the strength of the winds that blow, but usually wind transports smaller particles like silt and clay. Somewhat larger particles may be bumped or rolled along by the wind. Wind can carry particles across ocean basins and to great heights within our atmosphere. Wind is a stronger erosional force in arid regions than humid areas for two reasons. In arid regions, temperatures change greatly from night to day, which produces wind. Even strong winds in humid areas are less effective erosional agents because the ground is wet, so soil particles are heavier and less likely to be removed or transported by wind.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Describe the ways particles are carried by wind.
* Discuss several ways that wind erosion changes land surfaces.
* Describe how sand dunes form.
* Describe the type of deposits formed by windborne silts and clays.

==Transport of Particles by Wind==
[[File:Saltation-mechanics.gif|right|frame|'''Figure 10.24''': Saltation moves sand-size particles along the desert floor or on sand dunes.]]

Wind is able to transport the smallest particles of sediment, like silt and clay, over great distances and areas. Once these particles become mixed into the air, wind can keep them suspended for hours or maybe even days at a time. If nothing disturbs these tiny particles, wind would have trouble picking them off the ground surface. This is because very close to the ground, there is very little motion due to wind. Look behind a car or truck as it drives over an unpaved road. You will see a big cloud of dust that wasn't there before the truck disturbed the ground surface. Once these fine particles are disturbed, wind easily picks them up and distributes them.

Just as water carries different size particles in various ways, wind also transports particles as both '''bed load''' and '''suspended load'''. For wind, sand sized particles make up the bed load. These sand grains are moved along by the wind in a bump, roll and jump kind of motion. First, a grain of sand gets knocked into the air. It is too heavy to have wind carry it for long in suspension, so it falls back to the ground, possibly knocking another sand grain into the air as it hits the ground. This starts the process all over again. This process is called '''saltation''', which comes from a Latin word meaning 'to leap' (Figure 10.24). The suspended load for wind will always be very small particles of silt and clay, which are still able to be carried suspended in the air by wind.

===Erosion by Wind===
As wind moves sand sized particles, they will remain close to the ground, usually less than a meter from the ground even in the strongest winds. In a sandstorm, about a quarter of the particles are sand which moves as bed load. In arid regions, a sandstorm actually moves much smaller particles than sand in the winds. Wind can carry these small particles high into the air and these particles can infiltrate cracks around windows and doors in a dust storm (Figure 10.25).

[[File:Sandstorm_in_Al_Asad,_Iraq.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.25''': A dust storm approaches Al Asad, Iraq.]]

Sometimes these small particles are deposited in areas relatively close to their original source, but often silts and clays have been carried halfway across a continent or from desert areas on one continent across an entire ocean basin. Wind is more effective at erosion in arid regions because in humid regions smaller particles are held together by the moisture in the soil and by plant roots from the vegetation. Where it is dry, plants don't grow as well, so both these factors increase the ability of wind to transport particles, eroding the landscape.

The process of smaller particles being selectively transported by the wind is called '''deflation''' (Figure 10.26). This means the ground surface gets lower and rockier, as more and more small particles are blown away. Eventually, most of the smaller particles will have been removed and the rockier surface left behind is called '''desert pavement'''. This surface is covered by pebbles and gravel sized particles that are not easily moved by wind. If no disturbance from vehicles or animals disrupts the surface, deflation will stop once this rocky surface has formed.

[[File:Desert Pavement Mojave 2000.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.26''': This desert pavement formed in the Mojave Desert as a result of deflation.]]

All the particles moved by wind, whether as suspended load or by saltation as bed load, do the work of abrasion. As one particle hits another, each grain erodes another. You may have seen workers sandblasting the front of a building in order to remove paint or dirt. In the natural situation, erosion by wind polishes surfaces of rock. In the desert, rocks or boulders develop different polished flat surfaces as wind blows from different directions. These polished stones are called '''ventifacts''' (Figure 10.27).

[[File:Bradley 1930 dreikanter.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.27''': A polished stone called a ventifact, is produced by abrasion from sand grains.]]

Exposed rocks in desert areas often develop a dark brown to black coating called '''desert varnish'''. This coating forms on stable rock surfaces that don’t get much precipitation. The first part of the process is the transport of clay sized particles by wind which chemically react with other substances at high temperatures. The coating is formed of iron and manganese oxides. Ancient people carved into these darkened surfaces to make '''petroglyphs''' (Figure 10.28).

===Deposition by Wind===
[[File:Morocco Africa Flickr Rosino December 2005 84514010.jpg|200px|thumb|'''Figure 10.29''': This sand dune in Morocco shows secondary sand ripples along its slip face.]]

When you think of a desert or perhaps even a beach, the image that comes to mind might include '''sand dunes''' (Figure 10.29). In coastal regions, you will find sand dunes in the landward direction of the beach. Sand dunes form here as sand is blown from the shore inland. The sand dunes along a beach are likely to be composed of individual grains of the mineral quartz, unless the beach is in a tropical area. In humid regions, other minerals break down readily to form clays, leaving behind only the more resistant quartz. In the tropics, sand dunes may be composed of calcium carbonate. In a desert, the sand dunes may be composed of a variety of minerals. This is because a desert region, by definition, has very little water. This means that mostly mechanical weathering and very little chemical weathering occurs here. So desert sand dunes will include even unstable minerals.

Just as water waves are very selective about the size particles they carry and deposit, so will the size of the sand grains in a dune be very uniform. The sand dunes are formed of a particular size particle which is too heavy for the wind to transport. This process is sometimes so selective that wind will transport and carry rounded grains of sand, which roll easily, more readily than angular grains.

The faster and stronger the wind, the more particles it can carry. As wind slows down, it will drop off the heaviest particles first. This often happens as wind moves over some type of obstacle, such as a rock or an area of vegetation. As the wind moves up and over the obstacle, it increases in speed, but as soon as it passes the article, wind speed decreases. That is why you will often see deposits of sand on the downwind side of an obstacle. These deposits are the starting material for formation of sand dunes. This is the first condition needed for dunes to form.

In order for sand dunes to form, two more conditions must be met. The first of these conditions is that there is an abundant supply of sand. The last condition is that there are steady winds. As steady winds blow over an ample supply of sand, sand grains will bump and roll along, moving by saltation up the gently sloping, upwind side of the dune. As a grain of sand reaches the crest of the dune, it cascades down the steeper, downwind side of the dune, forming the '''slip face''' of the dune. The slip face is steep because it forms at the angle of repose for dry sand, which is about 34&amp;deg; (Figure 10.30).

[[File:Sand dune formation.png|center|frame|'''Figure 10.30''': Sand dunes have a gently sloping face in the upwind direction. Downwind, a steeper slip face forms.]]
{{clear}}
So as wind erodes and transports sand grains along the gently sloped upwind side of a dune, it deposits sand along the downwind slip face. As each new layer of sand falls down the slip face of the dune, cross beds are formed. Cross beds are named for the way each layer is formed at an angle to the ground. Some of the most beautiful sandstones are crossbedded sandstones (Figure 10.31). These sandstones preserve sands originally deposited as sand dunes in deserts millions of years ago.

[[File:DryForkDome.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.31''': These beautiful rocks are crossbedded sandstones from the Canyons of the Escalante in Utah.]]

Sand is always moving up the gently sloped side of a dune, and depositing on the downwind side, which means that dunes themselves slowly migrate in the downwind direction. This means that over a period of years, sand dunes will move many meters downwind. This is something that beach house owners need to consider if they live near coastal sand dunes. Once a sand dune becomes stabilized by vegetation, such as sea grasses, its migration will stop. Beach goers need to be careful not to disturb these grasses when they go to and from the beach.

==Reducing Wind Erosion &amp;ndash; Types of Sand Dunes==
There are several different forms that sand dunes will take. The differences are due to the amount of sand available to be moved, the character and direction of the wind and the type of ground the sand is moving over. The most usual crescent shaped dune is called a '''barchan dune''' (Figure 10.32). This type of dune forms when there is an adequate amount of sand being moved by constant winds that blow from one direction over hard ground. The crescent shape will curve in the direction the wind blows. In an area of constant winds with an abundant supply of sand, barchan dunes blend together into large scale sand ripples called '''transverse dunes'''. Many coastal dunes are this type of dune. Desert areas that are completely sand covered can join many transverse dunes together into a sand sea.

ground.]]

===Loess===
In many parts of the world, the finest grains of windblown silt and clay are deposited layer on layer, covering whole regions with these tiny particles (Figure 10.33). Geologists call these deposits '''loess''', which comes from the German word 'loose'. These deposits form downwind of areas of glacial outwash or desert areas. There are extensive loess deposits in China where deserts are the original source for these fine grained, windborne particles. One unusual characteristic of loess deposits is their ability to form nearly vertical cliffs, without grains sliding or slumping down the face. In China, people once built homes directly into these deposits because they are easy to dig into and they keep their shape. Loess deposits are also the source of wind transported materials that make very fertile soils in many regions of the world.

[[File:LoessVicksburg.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.33''': These vertical cliffs are formed from fine-grained, windblown silt and clay.]]

Much of the fine grained mud that covers the deepest parts of the ocean floor comes from silts and clays brought there by winds from the land. These tiny particles are easily carried long distances by wind. Once they are deposited on the water surface, they settle ever so slowly to the deep ocean floor, forming brown, greenish or reddish clays. Another source of windborne particles is volcanic activity. Explosive volcanoes eject volcanic ash and dust high into the air, sometimes reaching the stratosphere. Once these fine grained particles are airborne, they can travel hundreds or thousands of kilometers. Regions closest to the volcano are the areas with thickest deposits, but volcanic ash has even completely circled the Earth in extremely violent eruptions like Krakatau in 1883. Windborne volcanic ash can produce spectacularly beautiful sunsets, as well as decreasing worldwide temperatures, as ash and dust block out incoming sun's rays.

==Lesson Summary==
* Wind can carry small particles like sand, silt, and clay.
* Wind erosion produces sand blasting of surfaces and produces desert pavement, ventifacts, and desert varnish.
* Sand dunes are some of the most common wind born deposits, which come in many different shapes and sizes.
* Loess is a very fine grained, wind borne deposit that is important to soil formation in many regions.

==Review Questions==
# Discuss suspended load and bed load transport by wind.
# Describe how desert pavement forms.
# Discuss the factors necessary for sand dunes to form.
# Name four types of sand dunes that form in desert areas.
# Name one type of wind deposition.
# Why is wind erosion more important in arid regions than humid areas?

; bed load
: The portion of sand carried by wind as grains roll, bump, and jump along the ground surface.
; deflation
: The process of wind removing finer grains of silt and clay; causes the ground surface to subside.

; petroglyphs
: Rock carvings formed by cutting into desert varnish of exposed rock surfaces.
; saltation
: Movement of sand sized particles by rolling, bumping, and jumping along the ground surface.
; sand dune
: Deposit of sand formed in regions of abundant sand and constant winds.
; slip face
: Steeper, downwind side of a dune; region where sand grains fall down from the crest of the dune.
; suspended load
: Particles of silt and clay carried in the air by the energy of winds.
; ventifacts

==Points to Consider==
* Do you think strong hurricane winds along a coastline would produce wind related erosion?
* What would be needed to convert a desert area back to a productive region for farming?
* Do you think wind could sculpt exposed rocks? Explain how this might happen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''for''' keyword is used as special case of a pre-conditional loop that supports constructors for repeating a loop only a certain number of times in the form of a step-expression that can be tested and used to set a ''step size'' (the rate of change) by incrementing or decrementing it in each loop.

;Syntax
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
for (initialization ; condition; step-expression)
  statement(s);
&lt;/source&gt;

The for construct is a general looping mechanism consisting of 4 parts:
#. the initialization, which consists of 0 or more comma-delimited variable initialization statements
#. the test-condition, which is evaluated to determine if the execution of the for loop will continue
#. the increment, which consists of 0 or more comma-delimited statements that increment variables
#. and the statement-list, which consists of 0 or more statements that will be executed each time the loop is executed.

{{NOTE|Variables declared and initialized in the loop initialization (or body) are only valid in the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Scope#The scoping of the for control statement in detail|scope]] of the loop itself.}}

The for loop is equivalent to next while loop:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 initialization
 while( condition )
 {
   statement(s);
   step-expression;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{NOTE|
Each step of the loop (initialization, condition, and step-expression) can have more than one command, separated by a ''',''' (comma operator). ''initialization'',''condition'', and ''step expression'' are all optional arguments.  In C++ the comma is very rarely used as an operator.  It is mostly used as a separator (ie. &lt;tt&gt;int x, y;&lt;/tt&gt; ).}}

'''Example 1'''
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// a unbounded loop structure
for (;;)
{
  statement(s);
  if( statement(s) )
    break;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Example 2'''
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// calls doSomethingWith() for 0,1,2,..9
for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
{                  
  doSomethingWith(i); 
}
&lt;/source&gt;

can be rewritten as:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// calls doSomethingWith() for 0,1,2,..9
int i = 0;
while(i != 10)
{
  doSomethingWith(i);
  ++i;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The for loop is a very general construct, which can run unbounded loops ('''Example 1''') and does not need to follow the rigid iteration model enforced by similarly named constructs in a number of more formal languages. C++ (just as modern C) allows variables ('''Example 2''') to be declared in the initialization part of the for loop, and it is often considered good form to use that ability to declare objects only when they can be initialized, and to do so in the smallest scope possible. Essentially, the for and while loops are equivalent. Most for statements can also be rewritten as while statements.

In C++11, an additional form of the for loop was added. This loops over every element in a range (usually a string or container).

;Syntax
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
for (variable-declaration : range-expression)
  statement(s);
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Example 2'''
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
std::string s = &quot;Hello, world&quot;;
for (char c : s) 
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; ' ';
}
&lt;/source&gt;

will print &lt;pre&gt;H e l l o ,   w o r l d&lt;/pre&gt;.

Today glaciers cover about 10% of the land surface on Earth, but there have been times in Earth's recent history when glaciers have covered as much as 30% of the land surface. Around eight to six hundred million years ago, geologists believe that almost all of the Earth was covered in snow and ice. So today, scientists do a kind of detective work to figure out where the ice once was. We can figure this out by observing the ways the land has been eroded and by looking at the deposits that have been left behind. It is possible that there once was ice on the land where you are living right now. How can you find out? Let's talk about some of the features that scientists look for.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Discuss the different erosional features formed by alpine glaciers.
* Describe the processes by which glaciers change the underlying rocks.
* Discuss the sorting and types of particles deposited by glaciers as they advance and recede.
* Describe the landforms created by glacial deposits.

==Formation and Movement of Glaciers==
Today, we have glaciers near Earth's poles and at high altitudes in mountainous regions. The ice in a glacier erodes away the underlying rocks, just as rivers and streams shape the land they flow over. Like rivers and streams, glaciers tend to flow along existing valleys, but while the thick ice of glaciers is slowly moving over the land, it scours away the rocks below somewhat like a very slow and steady bulldozer. Especially up in the mountains, rivers cut 'V' shaped valleys as running water cuts deep into the rock. As a glacier flows through this same valley, it widens the valley and forms steeper sides to the valley walls, making a 'U' shape valley instead (Figure 10.34).

[[File:Glacier National Park - Many Glacier from Red Rock.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.34''': This valley in Glacier National Park shows the characteristic 'U' shape of a glacially carved valley.]]

[[File:Closeup of Bridalveil Fall seen from Tunnel View in Yosemite NP.JPG|200px|thumb|'''Figure 10.35''': Bridalveil Falls waterfall flows today in the hanging valley produced where a smaller glacier joins the main glacier.]]

In mountainous areas, often many smaller glaciers flow from higher elevations joining the main glacier as they move to lower places. Generally, these smaller glaciers carve shallower 'U' shaped valleys than the main glacier. A beautiful erosional feature, called a hanging valley, forms where the smaller 'U' shaped valley meets the deeper one of the main glacier. River water cascades down the steep valley walls forming breathtaking waterfalls (Figure 10.35).

==Glacial Erosion==
The two main ways that glaciers erode the underlying rock are '''abrasion''' and '''plucking'''. As the thick layer of ice pushes against the underlying rock, it scrapes and polishes the rock surface. As glaciers flow, they scratch the underlying bedrock with all the rocky material they are carrying. These scratches make long, parallel grooves in the bedrock, called '''glacial striations''', which show the direction the glacier moved. Also as the glacier slowly moves over the rock, glacial meltwater seeps into cracks and fractures of the underlying rock. As the water freezes, it pushes pieces of rock out of the underlying rock surface. These pieces of rock get plucked out and carried away by the flowing ice of the moving glacier (Figure 10.36).

[[File:Iceberg Cirque.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.36''': Iceberg Cirque in Glacier National Park was carved by glaciers.]]

There are several erosional features that form as a glacier both scours the rock and pulls pieces away. As rocks are pulled away from valley walls, a steep sided, bowl shaped depression forms at the top of a mountain, called a '''cirque'''. The word comes from the French word for circle. Once the ice melts away, a high altitude lake, called a '''tarn''' often forms from meltwater trapped in the cirque. If several glaciers flow down in different directions from a central mountain peak, these steep walled depressions can leave behind an angular, sharp sided peak called a '''horn'''. The Matterhorn in Switzerland is the most famous example of this type of erosion (Figure 10.37).

[[File:Matterhornnorth.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.37''': The Matterhorn in Switzerland is a classic example of a horn.]]

[[File:Striding Edge.jpg|200px|thumb|'''Figure 10.38''': When glaciers move down opposite sides of a mountain, a sharp edged ridge forms between them.]]

When two glaciers move down opposite sides of the mountain, the erosional landform that is created where they meet is a sharp edged, steep sided ridge, called an '''arête'''. Sometimes hiking trails follow along these narrow ridges, providing dramatic views in all directions (Figure 10.38).

As glaciers flow down a mountainside, the ice may also sculpt and shape the underlying bedrock as it flows. When a knob of bedrock is carved into an asymmetrical hill, it is called a '''roche moutonnée'''. In French, it means 'sheep rock'. Perhaps the villagers below the mountain thought these hills looked like sheep grazing in the valley. A roche moutonnée has a gently sloping side in the uphill direction of ice flow, with a steep side facing the downslope direction (Figure 10.39).

[[File:Arranque glaciar-en.svg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.39''': A roche moutonée forms where glaciers smooth the uphill side of the bedrock and pluck away rock from the downslope side.]]

==Depositional Features of Glaciers==
As glaciers flow over many years, all sorts of debris falls onto the glacier through mechanical weathering of the valley walls. Glaciers are solid ice, so unlike water, they can carry pieces of rock of any size. Glaciers move boulders as large as a house as easily as the smallest particles of sand and silt. These pieces of rock are carried by the glacier for many kilometers and are only deposited as the ice melts. When you think of a glacier, you may think of white ice and snow, but actually glaciers have lots of rocky bits all over them. Each of these different deposits has its own name based on where it forms, but as a group they are called '''moraines'''. A long pile of rocky material at the edge of a glacier is called a lateral moraine and one in the middle of the glacier is called a medial moraine. Lateral moraines form at the edges of the glacier as material drops onto the glacier from erosion of the valley walls. Medial moraines form where two glaciers join together. In this case, the lateral moraines from the
edges of each glacier meet in the middle to form the medial moraine (Figure 10.40).

[[File:Grosser Aletschgletscher 3178.JPG|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.40''': These long, dark lines on the Aletsch glacier in Switzerland are examples of medial and lateral moraines.]]

Wherever a glacier is located, it is always slowly flowing downhill. Sometimes the rate at which it is flowing downhill is faster than the rate at which it melts. In this situation, you will see the glacier advancing down the valley, with more and more ice with each successive year. More likely what you will see today if you get the chance to visit a glacier, is that the glacier is retreating. This means that is there is less ice in the glacier this year than there was the year before (Figure 10.41).

The glacier is clearly visible and well developed in 1938. From 1981 through 2005, the amount of glacial ice has decreased and the meltwater forming the lake has increased. In 2005, icebergs are further evidence of glacial melting.

[[File:Giebichenstein.jpg|200px|thumb|'''Figure 10.42''': A large boulder dropped by a glacier is called a glacial erratic.]]

When glaciers melt more than they flow forward, they deposit all the big and small bits of rocky material they have been carrying. In general, all these unsorted deposits of rock, formed directly by the ice, are called '''glacial till'''. If you live in an area where glaciers once were, you may have seen large boulders in the woods or even in the middle of a field. If these large rocks are a different type of rock than the bedrock in that area, they are called '''glacial erratics''' (Figure 10.42). Scientists know only ice could carry these large boulders great distances. The largest glacial erratic, called Big Rock found in Alberta, Canada weighs thousands of tons!

[[File:Esker (PSF).png|225px|thumb|'''Figure 10.43''': An esker is a winding ridge of sand and gravel deposited under a glacier by glacial meltwater.]]

Sometimes long ridges of rock are deposited at the furthest point that the glacier reached. These are called terminal and '''end moraines'''. Just as the conveyor belt at the grocery store moves your groceries to the end of the counter, a glacier transports rock and sediment while it flows. If you couldn't stop the conveyor belt at the grocery store, you would end up with a big jumbled pile of food at the end of the counter. An end moraine is a little bit like that. Whatever the glacier has been carrying, all gets left behind in a pile as the ice melts away. Geologists study these materials to figure out how far glaciers once extended and they can also figure out how long it took them to melt away. Long Island in New York was formed by two glacial end moraines. The end moraine that formed this pile of rock and stone deposited by glaciers extends all the way out to Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

Even while a glacier is flowing slowly downhill, it deposits a layer of sediment underneath the glacier, which scientists call '''ground moraine'''. This layer of sediment makes a thick layer of unsorted sediment under the glacier that fills in low spots and evens out higher areas. Ground moraine is an important contribution to the fertile transported soils in many regions. Scientists knew that all these rocks and thick soils came from somewhere else but for a while they did not know that they came from glacial ice. This is easy to understand because the ice is not there today. Many scientists thought the big rocks looked like they had been dropped there and they thought maybe icebergs carried by a huge flood had brought them there. Because of this early hypothesis, lots of glacial deposits are called 'drift', because they were thought to have drifted in on icebergs. They correctly understood that only ice could have brought these materials, but not that there were thick 'rivers' of ice moving over the Earth in places where no ice exists today.

Another glacial depositional landform which forms under a glacier by water melting from the ice is an '''esker''' (Figure 10.43). These curving ridges of sand are deposited by streams that run within the ice along the base of the glacier. A normal stream carves its channel into the ground, forming a 'V' shaped channel, with the wide part of the 'V' at ground level. Because the water in this stream moves through the ice, not on the ground, only the deposits mark where these streams flowed. When the ice melts, the sediments form an upside down 'V' on the ground.

A '''drumlin''' is another type of asymmetrical hill that glaciers form but this one is made of sediments. A drumlin is an upside down teaspoon shaped hill which lines up with the direction the ice moved. The sediments dropped by the glacier are thought to be formed into a long narrow hill by the flowing glacier with the gentle sloped end pointing in the direction of ice flow. Usually drumlins are found in groups called drumlin fields.

[[File:Clew Bay.JPG|500px|center|thumb|A drumlin.]]

Once material has been deposited by the glacier, water melting from the glacier can sort and retransport these sediments. An important difference between glacial deposits formed directly from the ice and those that form from glacial meltwater is their degree of sorting. Ice is capable of carrying a tremendous range of particle sizes, but solid ice does not sort any of these particles. So when material is dropped as ice melts, you will find very large pieces jumbled together in an unsorted deposit along with all the other size particles it carried. A very different situation occurs when running water moves particles. Liquid water cannot carry the large particles that ice carries. So as water moves through these unsorted deposits, it will select out only the smaller bits of sand and silt that it can carry. This produces a sorted deposit of just the sand and smaller particles transported by liquid water. Often these deposits form layer on layer and show the direction that rivers flowed. These deposits are called '''stratified drift'''. Often a broad area of stratified drift blankets the region just beyond the furthest reach of the glacier, as meltwater streams spread material out forming a broad plain called an '''outwash plain''' (Figure 10.44).

[[File:Braided River Outwash Plain.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.44''': Stratified drift carried by meltwater spreads out to form an outwash plain just beyond the furthest reaches of the glacial ice.]]

If an isolated block of ice remains behind as the glacier retreats, it may be surrounded and eventually covered over by these layers of sediment. In many years time, as the ice melts, it fills the depression with water, forming small circular lakes called '''kettle lakes''' (Figure 10.45). These small lakes are common in the areas where glaciers made their farthest advances.

[[File:Kettle-glacial-lake-form-isunngua-greenland.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 10.45''': Small, circular lakes are common in areas of glacial outwash. They form from blocks of ice left behind as the glacier retreats.]]

Several types of stratified deposits form in glacial regions but are not formed directly by the ice. In glaciated areas, lakes are covered by ice in the winter. During the winter months, darker, fine grained clays sink to the bottom of the quiet waters in the lake. In the spring, with glaciers producing lots of melting water, lighter colored sands are deposited on top of the darker layers at the bottom of the lakes. These distinctive layers, called '''varves''' have paired dark/light layers, with each layer representing one year of deposits.

'''Loess''' is a very fine grained, wind transported deposit which forms in areas of stratified drift glacial deposits. It is common in the middle of North America as well as the eastern central portion of Europe. This fine sediment is produced as glaciers grind the underlying rock producing a fine powder called '''rock flour'''.

==Lesson Summary==
* The movement of ice in the form of glaciers has transformed our mountainous land surfaces with its tremendous power of erosion.
* U-shaped valleys, hanging valleys, cirques, horns, and arêtes are just a few of the features sculpted by ice.
* The eroded material is later deposited as large glacial erratics, in moraines, stratified drift, outwash plains, and drumlins.
* Varves are a very useful yearly deposit that forms in glacial lakes.

==Review Questions==
# How much of the Earth's land surface is covered by glaciers today? Was the Earth ever covered by more ice than it is today?
# What is the shape of a valley that has been eroded by glaciers? How did it get that shape?
# What are two different features that can form as smaller side glaciers join the central main glacier?
# Name and describe the two processes by which glaciers erode the surrounding rocks.
# Name the erosional feature that would form as several glaciers in a mountainous region move downslope in different directions from a central peak.
# Describe the different types of moraines formed by glaciers.
# Describe the difference between glacial till and stratified drift. Give an example of how each type of deposit forms.
# Name and describe the two asymmetrical hill shaped landforms created by glaciers.

== Proposals?!? ==

Won't that be doing what the general reading room is doing already?!? I prefer feature requests, with a narrower scope. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 01:00, 13 July 2010 (UTC)
:That scope is too narrow.  This page was going unused and nobody here is a MediaWiki developer to properly respond to requests, which, if not specific to Wikibooks, need to be filed at Bugzilla anyway.  The general reading room will be for miscellaneous topics.  I'd even want to call it that if it weren't for so many links to it.  And the rooms are more like discussion rooms rather than reading rooms anyway. Take a look at Wikinews and how they break their rooms down.  Even Wikipedia has a page for proposals.  If anything, we've got an additional reading room in the form of the general assistance page over the administrative and technical assistance pages you'd see at other projects.  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:10, 13 July 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;There will be (divisor-1) terms in the answer.&quot;
No, there won't. At least, not in every case. It's probably a coincidence that it works for 1/19 and 1/29, because e.g. for 1/49 the answer has 42 repeating digits, not 48. The book of Vedic Mathematics doesn't say that there should be (divisor-1) '''digits''' in the answer, but it says that '''when you come to the (divisor-1) number, you have half the answer'''. And they have in mind the '''current remainder''', not the number of digits.
If you look for 48 as a remainder in the answer, it'll show up at step 21, which is exactly half the correct 42-digit answer.

But even still this technique doesn't work as a whole for 1/39, and I don't know why.
I mean, the division/multiplication by (x-1) still works, but the '''stop condition doesn't'''. You never achieve the number 38 (divisor-1) as a remainder in the answer, and it doesn't have 38 digits either - it has only '''6''' repeating digits: 0.('''025641''')... . The 38 isn't even divisible by 6, so it can't match the repeating pattern with more cycles at 38.
And even the rule that half the answer is 9-complement the first half of the answer - it doesn't work too.

What is so special about 1/39 that this method doesn't work for it?
It looks it doesn't matter that it isn't prime, because 49 isn't prime also, but the technique works for 1/49.

[[Wikibooks:Welcome|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be directly attributed to you.
* The use of your own [[Help:Watching pages|watchlist]] to monitor pages that you are interested in.
* A personal user page and [[Help:talk page|talk page]].
* The ability to [[Help:Preferences|customize]] certain aspects of the Wikibooks interface.
* The ability to rename pages.
* The eligibility to become an [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrator]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].

Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]]. Be sure to sign your talk page comments with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;).

== Welcome message ==
Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

== Multiple projects about password recovery ==
I noticed that you started multiple project on password recovery software. At this point I can't understand if you intended to start the project independently or if you did intent to start a single book about the subject.&lt;br&gt;
Take a look in the links above, and remember that you can move the already created pages into the a unique work that covers the subject.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 09:38, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

This is one of the few books that actually [[Happiness/Money|cites]] [[Happiness/Compassion|academic]] [[Happiness/Health|studies]], and there are [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/03/10/harvards_crowded_course_to_happiness/ college courses] and textbooks on the subject. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] ([[User talk:Hagindaz|talk]]) 17:02, 5 June 2010 (UTC)

::: Good to hear, but I'm still leaning towards a vote of keep since (a) the related Wikipedia article has plenty of verifiable academic sources, (b) it seems most or at least many of the facts in the book are already cited or can be cited by those sources, and (c) there are respected accredited institutions and accompanying textbooks about the subject. What's the issue exactly? --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] ([[User talk:Hagindaz|talk]]) 01:33, 8 June 2010 (UTC)
:::: &lt;s&gt;{{trans}}&lt;/s&gt; One question that comes to my mind is what is the book trying to be.  Is it a book that studies what things influence happiness, or a book that guides you to happiness?  Different parts of the book read a bit differently.  I think it is the parts of the book that read as a guide that are the ones that brought it up here.  The parts that are more cite more clinical studies about happiness do not so much try to guide you.  The parts of the book which are meant to guide you two happiness are not supported.  Overall I think it is possible to cite sources and still have OR problems.  Here is the main issue I see many of the sources sited are primary sources, it is not clear to the reader if they have been later verified or refuted by other researchers. Placing these in juxtaposition with opinion about how to become happy becomes a type of synthesis.  To give an example of what I mean, there implicit claim that mediation is correlated with happiness (by including a page on it).  This claim is perhaps ''suggested'' by the following section on Spirituality (which mostly just points to wikipedia).  Notice though, that page doesn't cite any academic references, just a guide on meditating, In fact the page in this book about meditating doesn't once mention the subject of happiness! Many of the later pages are similar (is willpower really connected to happiness? how about luck?).  Maybe there is something here that could be salvaged, but I don't think it will get away for OR issues, so I am officially changing my position that it should be transwikied to wikiversity.

::::: Would saying &quot;x correlates with happiness; here is how to do or be x...&quot; be original research, if all claims have reliable sources? What if existing textbooks do this? (According to the article I linked, the Harvard class (and accompanying textbook?) teaches how to meditate.) --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] ([[User talk:Hagindaz|talk]]) 13:09, 14 June 2010 (UTC)
:::::: That isn't original research; that is bias. :) [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 13:42, 14 June 2010 (UTC)

::::::: {{comment}} (edit conflict with Kayau) It depends a bit on how it is done.  Here is an example of something I think would be original research.  &quot;Your job is the [http://www.physorg.com/news70814635.html most important factor in your happiness]. Being a mathematician is known to be [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123119236117055127.html the best job].  To improve your happiness you can become a mathematician, to become a mathematician you must...&quot; 
::::::: I hope that suggestion sounds a bit absurd (but I could provide more primary sources to support it.)  One problem is that even if the studies explicitly said that mathematicians were happier (which I admit they don't say) nothing says that forcing yourself into the job of a mathematician will help you be happy.  Perhaps you just need a positive outlook on life to survive graduate school.  More generally, the statement &quot;x correlates with happiness&quot; is very different from &quot;doing x will help you be happy&quot;.  You would really need a study that said, &quot;after starting x people's happiness improved.&quot;
::::::: To be really honest to your scenario, I would to change the statement &quot;To improve your happiness you can become a mathematician, to become a mathematician you must...&quot;  To simply &quot;To become a mathematician you must...&quot;, but if I the page placed this discussion under a section on how to improve your happiness, wouldn't the message be just the same?

:::::::: (PS about Harvard) In my some of my undergraduate acting classes we would start the day with doing some Yoga.  It was the opinion of the professor that doing yoga helped ones acting abilities, but I know of no scholarly research that backed this claim up.  Thankfully University professors are not required to keep original research out of their lectures, which is one reason it is important to allow OR at wikiversity. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:49, 14 June 2010 (UTC)
::::::::: Common sense can be labeled as OR. Common sense tends to be mostly obvious but it also comes in layers (and at times common sense seems rational but has no real scientific basis). Most Yoga exercises (there are various types) do increase relaxation, so depending on the context it could indeed benefit the activity. Most of the Yoga classes I've been I would end asleep on the rug.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:35, 14 June 2010 (UTC)

:::::::: Sure, as is true for any book, all the standard disclaimers about the power and limits of correlation would either be stated or implied. Regarding your example, there is lots of mainstream research about the relationship between happiness and the workplace. A chapter discussing the trade-offs of various professions and how to choose a good profession, given a person's characteristics and interests, seems reasonable to me. So I would change &quot;To become a mathematician you must...&quot; to &quot;To choose a suitable profession, you must...&quot;. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] ([[User talk:Hagindaz|talk]]) 16:30, 14 June 2010 (UTC)
{{outdent|::::::::}} It sounds like we at least agree that I committed some kind of synthesis in my argument about happiness and mathematics.  As I started to write my response, I happened to start reading one of the references pointed in the book.  The sources cited are mostly of of the same poor quality as the example argument that I gave.  The academic references pointed out that most of the the pages on about [[Happiness/Money|Money]], [[Happiness/Compassion|Compassion]] and [[Happiness/Health|Health]] are flawed.  Let me mention what I read when I looked at the references.
* [[Happiness/Money|Money]] by far gives the best representation of the facts presented in the reference, though the paper itself is rather a critical of &quot;Happiness research&quot;.  Mainly this is a defense of the United states socio-economic system and it says about happiness research &quot;Even if we table the damning charges of questionable science and bad moral philosophy, the American model still comes off a glowing success in terms of happiness.&quot; But there is not too much to complain about with this particular reference.  Tough, going forward into the &quot;how to be happy&quot; section of the book it would be important to keep in mind here that the statements are about average populations, not individuals.  See my follow up remark in the third point. 
*[[Happiness/Compassion|Compassion]]  The page claims that &quot;people who volunteer are happier and healthier, regardless of income.&quot; but in the cited reference I could find (nor my word search) could find the terms health or happiness.  Instead the paper examines various models that attempt to understand civic involvement in Britain.  The paper goes on to say that income is an important factor in all of the types of civic activism they put forward.  Claims about happiness are not at all the topic of this paper, and using this paper as a source to support this statement is synthesis.
* [[Happiness/Health|Health]] Well there is so little hear maybe I shouldn't complain too much.  The page does explain the the figures it is putting forward are correlations between health of a population vs average happiness of the population as such wouldn't really be relevant to the discussion of your health and your happiness.  Since the stated goal of this wikibook is to &quot;make the search for self-fulfillment easier.&quot; it is natural to assume the information being put forward is for the individual reader, and not for someone doing policy planning for a society.  This page is particularly misleading because there is nothing to tip off the reader that this statement was not a measurement aimed at individuals, unlike money which at least mentions GDP per capita.
For the moment this book is taking ideas mentioned in various first source articles and trying to use them to paint a picture of what happiness is.  The ideas taken are (by and large) not the ''main ideas'' of the papers being referred to.  It also surrounds these ideas with pages containing its own point of view about happiness. To me this seems to be original research and would be better, which is why I felt it would be better suited to wikiversity. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 22:41, 14 June 2010 (UTC)

: The reason I am hesitant is that these claims (unlike the math example) seem like they would be mentioned in regular textbooks on the subject. From looking at the Wikipedia article, most of the claims in the book seem pretty mainstream. If this isn't the case, then I do support transwiki as well. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] ([[User talk:Hagindaz|talk]]) 13:36, 15 June 2010 (UTC)

:: Mainstream =/= good. ;) [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 13:59, 15 June 2010 (UTC)

::: :) Mainstream =/= bad. Mainstream = generally accepted. [[wikt:Mainstream]] is, generally, the common current of thought of the majority. I don't think this in general terms should by itself be an argument for deletion (or even traswiki), but a refusal to permit the addition of a minority view, would justify a POV tag. A mainstream view also excludes the issue of OR (in the meaning of expressing new concepts) since it implies it is generally accepted as valid. But the point being argued is that some of the propositions aren't mainstream, and that the errors are cumulative and central to the works subject making it extremely difficult to be acceptable under WIW.
::: Taking the analysis of [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] I can defend opposing points but couldn't possibly state that I fell that after making the needed balanced corrections the work would have any educational purpose.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 15:25, 15 June 2010 (UTC)

::::Generally accepted and the current thought of majority =/= NPOV =/= valid. :P[[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 00:51, 16 June 2010 (UTC)

::::: Can be. NPOV only requires that the content doesn't cater only to one positions. Many mainstream propositions aren't opposed or have a consistent opposition, take the example &quot;The speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light.&quot; or &quot;Man is the main cause of global warming.&quot; alone this affirmations are valid and unless I create a book whose subject derives from them, not mentioning marginal opposition wouldn't break NPOV. This is also concurrent to problems of using common sense.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:47, 16 June 2010 (UTC)

:::::::Science is life (the study of reality). In any case I'll give you a proposition that you have used &quot;Young people will lack experience.&quot; this is common sense but can be argued against (because it is also relativistic). It would be acceptable to make this general affirmation in a book but like the above examples using the proposition as a core subject of a book without further explanation and counterbalance would create a NPOV issue.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:58, 16 June 2010 (UTC)

:: Backing up a bit I don't view wikipedia as a decent source for what is &quot;Mainstream&quot;. My personal experience editing there has taught me that many articles take a rather unusual perspective on the mathematical issues, or spend a lot of time discussing things outside normally considered mainstream mathematics.  I suspect the topic of happiness research has a lot fewer a lot fewer experts editing these articles.  Since I wouldn't use wikipedia to judge what is mainstream in my field, I really don't trust it to judge what is mainstream in other fields.  
:: Further, I am not convinced the Wikipedia article really supports this book.  For example, of the items listed in the &quot;Keys to Happiness&quot;, the wikipedia article on [[w:Happiness|happiness]] doesn't even mention: [[Happiness/Luck|Luck]], [[Happiness/Passion|Passion]], [[Happiness/Compassion|Compassion]], or [[Happiness/Independence|Independence]].  In other places where the &quot;Keys&quot; are mentioned, the specifics disagree, such as with [[Happiness/Health|Health]], where the wikipedia article says there is allots 15% of your happiness is depends on: socioeconomic status, marital status, health, income, sex (possibly others?) while the way this book is written makes it seem as if the number determined by health alone is 70%.  

::I find the later sections are also not supported by wikipedia, There is nothing I can find about about using your awareness to catch negative thoughts and exerting your will power to change them. Nor do I think it is particularly mainstream to advise people to pursue happiness as if they were running a business. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:54, 16 June 2010 (UTC)

::: I would accept Wikipedia as a representation of the mainstream and here on the project we have in past discussions. Regarding your observations it could be argued that because of a deeper level of knowledge/experience in a field one stops sharing the mainstream. As a historical exampled consider [[w:Copernicus]], it couldn't even be stated that he was doing OR.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:58, 16 June 2010 (UTC)

:::: While I might agree that developing a deeper level of understanding about a subject may cause you to reject the mainstream positions on that subject, it in know way invalidates your understanding of the mainstream positions.  I can read a wikipedia article on mathematics and accurately decide if it deviates from the mainstream thinking about the subject '''regaurdless''' of my feelings about that particular article.  I think historically Copernicus correctly understood the main stream positions about his theories.  I am not sure what your implying by &quot;it couldn't even be stated that he was doing OR&quot;, he was an astronomer and it is blindingly obvious he did some very original research. That is great, and he was good at it.  But if wikibooks had in existed in some form during the Renaissance with something like its current policies, he still couldn't include his work in our tombs.

::::: Panic, you may want to read [[w:WP:SCRABBLE]]. It's not directly related here but it might be helpful. Also, I never said young people all lack experience. I only attributed my lack of experience to be age. This cause does not have to apply to everyone.

:::::: We are mostly in agreement on the points. The devil is on the details and that is why I extended your remarks above. Yes you didn't express yourself with that phrase but the meaning was implied as a generalization or a mainstream view as we are discussing. If you are getting hung on the details you can re-read our firsts interaction, I also remarked that I didn't agree with that mainstream view...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:41, 17 June 2010 (UTC)

::::: As I said to [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] we are mainly in agreement. The concept of mainstream is an highly personal view of what others think about a subject, marketing and publicity work to shape that view on others, it is somewhat similar to a status of majority consensus (were opposition is non blocking until it gets visibility and recognition).
::::: My reference to Copernicus was a quick example regarding [[w:Heliocentrism]] as the contradiction of the mainstream  view (at that time), and that fringe concepts at times are valid against what the mainstream accepts as immutable truths. Without even being based on OR (he did express and validated the concepts mathematically but the core view was not his creation). It is also interesting to mention that the information brokers at the time (the church) shaped the mainstream view of the known world and worked to prevent that view from changing, leading to [[w:Galileo Galilei]]'s death due to an attempt to publish his observations.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:41, 17 June 2010 (UTC)

::: By mainstream I mean that it would be found in a university textbook on the subject. [http://www.amazon.com/reader/076192633X?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ref_=sib_dp_pt#reader_076192633X This book], for example, discusses &quot;Capitalizing on Positive Events&quot;, passion in the context of &quot;Gainful Employment&quot;, &quot;Empathy/Egoism and Altruism&quot;, and &quot;Individualism: The Psychology of ME&quot;, and in general alludes to topics in this book. The claim that &quot;Seeking happiness is like running a business: you have limited resources to make as much profit as possible. Because supply is limited, it must be used as efficiently as possible.&quot; is just the economic concept of utility maximization given opportunity costs, which is a well established partial proxy for happiness. Economists often model business profit maximization the same way they model utility maximization, and this is generally a fairly predictive model. I agree the book should be cleaned up and updated, as with most books here, but, given my limited knowledge, the base seems okay. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] ([[User talk:Hagindaz|talk]]) 16:27, 17 June 2010 (UTC)

:::: I have taken a look at this book, and I think it should be noted that this book is not a book about happiness.  The book is about Positive Psychology.  I gather this means the subject seems to intend to introduce the study of positive aspects of human emotion as hope, compassion, and resilience to balance the usual study of more negative topics of mental-illness, depression etc. Certainly happiness is a part of the discussion of this book, it is not its focus any more than other positive emotions.  As many of the sections in the &quot;Keys to Happiness&quot; are considered positive human emotions they naturally occur in this text, but reading some the sections mentioned above I see occur outside the discussion of happiness and do not discuss happiness in any detail.  (Also some sections are not directly what the one might expect.  For example, &quot;Capitalizing&quot; is a technical term meaning &quot;To tell others about...&quot; where I was expecting a section more about how to use positive events to your benefit.)  Overall I am not convinced the claims in the Happiness wikibook are really mainstream claims about happiness but maybe the wikibook confused the concepts of Happiness and Positive Psychology?  Also as a final note, having read about the book I can see that the Harvard course about Positive Psychology mentioned above is not simply about happiness but many other aspects of Psychology as well.  So, after reading some of the text you point out I still think this consists of OR and should be transwikied to wikiversity. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 22:43, 17 June 2010 (UTC)

::::: Ah, maybe there is more of a middle ground!  [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]], how do you feel about merging this book into [[Positive Psychology]]? (Which I only just realized exists)  It is currently empty, and whose subject is more in line currently taught in universities, and we could place the text you find as a reference! (Since most of it is readable via amazon this would be a great aid to people wanting to develop the text.)   I suggest we move the sections in the &quot;Keys to happiness&quot; sections (except Luck!) to their own sections in the new book, which would be more in line with what I read in the text you found.  Some sections would have to be changed a bit. For example, in money it is no longer clear why we would be talking about the relation between GDP and average happiness, but fortunately there is lots of info in the gainful employment section that we could capitalize on.  I don't think the existing sections in the self-help portion of the book would really make sense for a merge (based on what is actually written in the vs what I have read today.)  Does this sound like a reasonable plan? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 22:43, 17 June 2010 (UTC)

:::::: That's a good idea; I support a merger. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] ([[User talk:Hagindaz|talk]]) 14:31, 19 June 2010 (UTC)

:::::: [[File:Symbol merge vote.svg|15px]] '''Merge''' Just, to make it easier for everyone one to see, I officially support the merger idea as well. Panic, Kayau, what do you think about merging as per my plan above?

{{outdent|:::::::}} Here is what I think should be done:
* Somehow replace the learning sources on Wikiversity about happiness with our version.
* Then transwiki the positive psychology book to Wikiversity.
* Do the merger in Wikiversity.
Or whatever way that achieves the same result. Of course, we need Wikiversity's approval. Darklama required here. :) [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 15:04, 19 June 2010 (UTC)

:This work, even if categorized with the others, stands apart. It is extremely balanced and I would argue doesn't have an OR issue.

:[[File:Symbol redirect vote.svg|15px]] '''Transwiki''' I would like to disagree with &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt;'s appraisal.  Instead of discussing how to improve your study habits or test scores, which I consider to be study skills.  This book explicitly states that learning the material and achieving a perfect performance on examinations is not enough to be a good student and focuses quite a bit on what I would dub extra curricular behavior.  It discusses a lot of how one should interact with other people in life, &quot;Obey your elders&quot;, &quot;Behavior should be first and then comes academics.&quot;, etc. almost in equal part to topics that directly effect being a student.   Why do things like saying hello to people in the morning affect how good of a student you are?  Why is academic achievement is not enough to be a good student?  Overall, I see no way to verify the advise given here, and perhaps the book would be better suited to wikiversity.  Also it perhaps should be noted we have other far better books about studying here such as [[How to Pass a Course]] and [[Study Skills]].  (To play devils advocate for a moment) These books also do not do not cite any references.  But unlike the current book the advise given sticks mostly to how to study and would be easier to verify.

The definition of 'civilisation' from my history book is (the way I remember it): citizens living in a city from the latin word (yeah, I forgot the latin word because the exams are over) with a government to protect the citizens, a systematic form of writing and communication, and a developed economy, religion and education system. Since the prehistoric times cannot have a 'systematic form of writing of communication', it does not fall into the category of 'ancient civilisations'.

: {{keep}} It seems like potentially relevant background for the subject of the book.  The page probably wants improving to fit into the organization of the book (it's classified as a stub, though, so that's no surprise).

: The organization of the book might be improved, too, in that the trichotomy of publishable/developing/stub articles only works, if at all, for the largely interchangeable &quot;articles&quot;, not for infrastructural pages like &quot;Introduction&quot; and so on.  This seems to be an infrastructural page.  However, all of that belongs on the main talk page of the book.  Including the deletion proposal itself, I think (with a pointer to it from the page's talk page, probably).  If there was no response at the book for a week or so (similar time frame to adopting a seemingly abandoned book), then it would make sense to bring the proposal here; but coming here first seems to be bypassing the possible community of the book.  That's probably true of most individual-page deletion proposals (though not all, depending on the scope of the reason for deletion):  it's an organizational matter for the book, and people with an interest in the book &amp;mdash;who might not be conspicuous by recent edits&amp;mdash; should usually be the ones the proposal is addressed to, until and unless it becomes clear that there simply is no such &quot;local&quot; community, or at least none sufficiently active to respond in a reasonable time frame.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:30, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

:: It seems to be an organizational weakness of the way we have things set up that {{nowrap|[[Template:Rfd|the template provided]]}} for proposing discussion of a page deletion has built into it the assumption that the discussion will be here.  The process of discussing a page deletion within the book community is implied by the fact that consensus at the book is {{nowrap|[[WB:Deletion policy#Speedy deletions|speedy-deletion criterion 4]]}}, but the template structurally discourages it.  We ought to have things set up to encourage trying local discussion first before coming here.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:43, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

'''comment''' I've been considering whether this should be vfd-ed almost since I went here. I thought and thought, and decided to nominate it. I believe that the book does not really have a 'community given the lack of 'regulars: [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChangesLinked&amp;days=30&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Wikijunior:Ancient_Civilizations related changes].

:Ah, but that's the point of using the talk pages:  you can't judge from recent changes.  You would probably conclude, for example, that [[Conlang]] has no regulars on the basis of its [{{fullurl:Special:RecentChangesLinked|days=30&amp;target=Conlang}} recent changes].  In fact, there's at least one reasonably active Wikibookian who is really just here to work on the Conlang book, and happens to be drawn into other things around the project along the way (in a way vaguely reminiscent (if one completely cuts out the heroic element) of the way James Garner's character in [[w:Support Your Local Sheriff!|''Support Your Local Sheriff!'']] was just passing through town on his way to Australia).  Which is, at least in part, why I think we should find a way of structurally encouraging people to try local inquiry first.  Of course, it might only produce a subset of the same people who would respond here, but so what?  The problem can still be talked through first by people especially interested in the book, and perhaps resolved &amp;mdash; and if a consensus isn't reached, the matter can still be brought here later, with additional background information to the nomination here.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 17:15, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

The whole idea of teaching elementary school kids calculus is absurd.

:[[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' I wondered about transwiki on the grounds that it might be interpreted as OR.  It's not the only book at Wikijunior to take an unusual approach, though.  It seemed to me that the problems with the metaphor/simile/whatever needed to be taken care of as the top priority in the best interests of the book, its author, its prospective readers, and whatever project the book ends up in, so I figured to address that first and then the question of possible transwiki could be considered in an all-around more comfortable atmosphere.  Right now it feels a bit like shoving our problems off on our sister project.  Other than that discomfort, though, I have no actual objection to a transwiki.

:By the way, although I'm not convinced this particular strategy (assuming it's divorced from the problem metaphor) will succeed, the idea of teaching calculus to elementary students is not inherently absurd.  If I remember rightly, it was alluded to in {{nowrap|[[w:Beyond This Horizon|''Beyond This Horizon'']]}}; I think it was something about a child being only on basic calculus, and not nearly old enough for anything as dry as arithmetic.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:41, 27 June 2010 (UTC)

:Thank you all for your concerns.  

:A little background:  I made up this curriculum for my family, and we've been working through it for about 2 hours/week for the past 6 years.  This is a substantive amount of time, but it's half the time kids spend on math in the classroom and (with humility) I've achieve nearly twice as much by teaching 12th-grade mathematics to a 5th-grader.  

:specific responses:
::Kayau -- by my observation, most kids already hate standard maths at age 10.  Furthermore, have you taken a look at {{nowrap|[[w:Non-standard_calculus|''Non-Standard Calculus'']]}}?  It simplifies the subject's foundations enormously.  Simply including a single number, like we include pi or the imaginary number &quot;i&quot;, much of Calculus effectively reduces to algebra.
::QU -- there have been some discussion on the metaphors and I have made a retraction and suggested a compromise.
::Martin Krause -- I will change &quot;program&quot; to &quot;approach&quot;

:On a more general note:  while we sit and hypothesize about the merits of the approach and whether or not it would work, unless there's data specific to this or similar approaches, their success or failure, then any conclusions we draw is baseless.  Does anyone have data on the success or failures of similar approaches?  I myself only have 1.5 data points against 2 children of age 7 &amp; 10.  The data takes 7 years to come by because it takes 7 years to complete the curriculum.  The experiment has just begun, and as I understand it, Wikibooks is an appropriate venue for experimental work.  I am also perfectly happy to have the book in either of Wikibooks, Wikijunior, or Wikiversity.  In the book's preface, I could make a disclosure to the effect that &quot;this approach seems to be working in my family, perhaps it will work in yours&quot;.

::: In the exercises section 1.5 of Keisler's work Elementary Calculus, the calculation of limits (the foundation of the derivative) is given mostly as exercises in algebraic manipulation of the new number rather than delta-epsilon arguments.  (ok, 2 new classes of numbers infinity &amp; infinitesimal, much like the equivalent class of 1/2 is treated as the number 1/2).

::[[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' I think I should explain why I think this is original research despite the fact that the book aims to cover known facts.  The point is that while the end mathematical facts are known the methods taken to get there are new.  There are many journals (for example [http://www.maa.org/pubs/cmj.html College Mathematics Journal]) that accept papers about '''new ways to explain known theorems''' in calculus.  These journals are peer reviewed serious journals, and many colleges tenure review committees acknowledge papers published in them as research activity.  When reading this page and I reach ideas like describing exponentiation as a fractal like graph (or snowflake) I think to myself this is original, and I am immediately lead to several questions for further investigation (why is rotation the right symmetry to look at?  What about cases when exponentiation is commutative such as 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, is this reflected in a symmetry of the diagram? etc) While the quote above about &quot;coining new terms, ...&quot; still applies, I don't think it gets at the heart of why this is original research.  To me the real answer is that if I wanted to read more about my simple questions about snowflakes there are not any references to turn to.  And I suspect if more of the work was posted we would see many more excellent and creative ideas that just don't appear elsewhere.  Let me emphasize I think it is good work.  And I hope that Numiri don't get discouraged by criticism.  It has a place in the wikimedia family, and I look forward to reading through it when it is fully available.  But I do think that wikiversity is a better project for it. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 18:30, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

:::That seems a very cogent case that it's OR.  I gather Numiri is now thinking transwiki on the grounds that the book is a tool that should be wielded by educators, which also sounds right.  (And I share your hope that Numiri isn't discouraged by criticism.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 20:09, 30 June 2010 (UTC)

::::Thank you Pi zero &amp; TheNub314.  I am glad that you mention the potential sensitivity towards criticism.  Truth to tell, I have been personally vested in this approach for years so it does take effort to divorced myself from the criticism personally.  But like Pi zero said earlier, it is in the best interest of the audience and the material and I will try to remember that and take it in the spirit of community contribution.  I am glad we are moving it away from wikijunior because I do see the potential for backlash.

::::Also, I will include one of the alternative metaphors discussed above so that the teacher can have a choice as to which metaphor and vocabulary to use.

::::I don't know what the protocol is for concluding a discussion, but unless someone says &quot;do not transwiki&quot; in the next 2 days, I will make a request for the transfer at that time. [[User:Numiri|Numiri]] ([[User talk:Numiri|talk]]) 07:15, 1 July 2010 (UTC)

::: '''Comment''' I think &quot;new ways of doing old things&quot; isn't as clear cut as that. I think some schools leave how best to teach a subject up to a teacher's discretion, as long as students gain required knowledge and skills that live up to the school's standards. I think [[Wikibooks:Original research#New or novel writing methods]] tries to take into consideration this issue, even though that is still only a draft proposal. I think the focus should be on whether a book is teaching new and novel knowledge and skills or not. Wikibooks allowed books about constructed languages (conlangs) when the vocabulary and rules of the language is well documented elsewhere by some trusted source, even if a means of teaching the language is not as well documented. I think even non-constructed languages can be taught in new and novel ways which could be more appropriate for the target audience, which should be allowed to exist on Wikibooks.
::: I'm not as certain whether such books should be given a free pass or be subjected to some scrutiny. I think this particular book might be a reasonably subject of some scrutiny because the new way to teach a subject may seem inappropriate for the target audience by some people. Yet this problem may also be something that could be easily fixed and addressed, which is usually enough of a reason to keep and let book contributors fix it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:23, 8 July 2010 (UTC)
::::[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' - The idea of teaching calculus to Elementary school children is ''far'' from absurd.  When you consider that the youngest person in the world to gain a first class honors degree in mathematics is something like 9 years old, it doesn't seem so silly.  

::::I have come across children with abilities far in advance of what you would expect from ones who should be at Elementary school, and I consider as someone who works with children for upwards of 55 hours a week, that you should nurture any talent they have while you can.  This kind of material is perfect for that.  

::::If you can have kids recognizing words and reading by the age of 2 or 3 at the level of a 3rd grader (see [[w:Robert Titzer|Robert Titzer]]), this shouldn't be much different.  Grow what you can while you can, cause you may not get another opportunity. [[User:BarkingFish|BarkingFish]] ([[User talk:BarkingFish|talk]]) 20:29, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

:::: While I understand that many schools allow teachers leeway, that doesn't necessarily mean that every explanation given in an elementary school isn't OR.  My point of mentioning the fractal like graphs used to explain exponentiation is exactly that is is &quot;new and novel&quot;.  If the methods used here were well documented elsewhere in some trusted source (as with conlangs) I would not suggest it was OR.  But it was exactly my point that there are not any trusted sources to turn to if you wish to veryify facts about this book. (It is a serious question to ask why is rotating the graphs the right way to look at commutativity, it seems to me it shouldn't be the correct symmetry, but I could be wrong.  I would like to verify that this idea is correct and if it isn't then I would like to correct it.  But there is no reference I can turn to.)

=== Usage ===

A template standardizing the portal templates and for other purposes.

=== Syntax ===
The template is not a stand-alone template and so once the box header is typed or pasted the template {{tl|box-footer}} must immediately follow it.

This example assumes that you have a separate page containing the content, and transclude it onto the page.
&lt;pre&gt;
{{box-header
| title= 
| editpage=  &lt;!-- This data must be the same  --&gt;
| titleforeground=
| titlebackground=
| background=
| viewpage= &lt;!-- This data must be the same  --&gt;
}}

{{ &lt;!-- This data must be the same --&gt; }}

{{box-footer | text }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This example assumes that the content is entered between the header and footer. Notice that viewpage is not in there. It will not work because it links to the page you are on, and therefore Wikibooks does not link it. 

&lt;pre&gt;
{{box-header
| title= 
| editpage=  &lt;!-- This field must be the same as the name of the page it is on. --&gt;
| titleforeground=
| titlebackground=
| background=
}}

Box Content

{{box-footer | text }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Sample ===

&lt;pre&gt;
{{box-header
| title= The Quotes of Quotes
| editpage= Template:Box-header/sample
| titleforeground= white
| titlebackground= red
| background= white
}}

{{quote|Doubt thou the stars are fire. Doubt that the sun doth move. Doubt truth to be a liar. But never doubt my love.|[[w:William Shakespeare|]]}}

{{Box-footer| [[William Shakespeare]] }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{box-header
| title= The Quotes of Quotes
| editpage= Template:Box-header/sample
| titleforeground= white
| titlebackground= red
| background= white
}}

{{quote|Doubt thou the stars are fire. Doubt that the sun doth move. Doubt truth to be a liar. But never doubt my love.|[[w:William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]]}}

{{box-footer| [[William Shakespeare|more...]] }}

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''const_cast''' keyword can be used to remove the ''const'' or ''volatile'' property from an object.  The target data type must be the same as the source type, except (of course) that the target type doesn't have to have the same ''const'' qualifier.  The type TYPE must be a pointer or reference type.

;Syntax
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
    TYPE* const_cast&lt;TYPE*&gt; (object);
    TYPE&amp; const_cast&lt;TYPE&amp;&gt; (object);
&lt;/source&gt;

For example, the following code uses '''const_cast''' to remove the ''const'' qualifier from a object:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Foo {
public:
  void func() {} // a non-const member function
};

void someFunction( const Foo&amp; f )  {
  f.func();      // compile error: cannot call a non-const 
                 // function on a const reference 
  Foo &amp;fRef = const_cast&lt;Foo&amp;&gt;(f);
  fRef.func();   // okay
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Documentation subpage}}

'''{{tl|quote}}''' adds a [[w:block quote|block quote]] to a page.

This is easier to type and more wiki-like than the equivalent HTML {{tag|blockquote}} tags, has additional pre-formatted attribution and source parameters, and contains a workaround for [[Bugzilla:6200]], which means you don't need to type {{tag|p}} tags manually.

Note: Block quotes do not normally contain quotation marks.  See [[w:Block quotation#Formatting block quotations|Formatting block quotations]].

=== Synopsis ===

;Unnamed (positional) parameters
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{quote|phrase|person|source}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

; Named parameters
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{quote|text=phrase|sign=person|source=source}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Example ===

; Wikitext:
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{quote|text=Cry “Havoc,” and let slip the dogs of war.|sign=[[w:William Shakespeare|]]|source=[[w:Julius Caesar (play)|''Julius Caesar'']], Act III, Scene I}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

; Result:
{{quote|text=Cry “Havoc,” and let slip the dogs of war.|sign=[[w:William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]]|source=[[w:Julius Caesar (play)|''Julius Caesar'']], Act III, Scene I}}

=== Restrictions ===

If you do not provide quoted text, the template generates a parser error message, which will appear in red text in the rendered page.

If any parameter's actual value contains an equals sign (=), you '''''must''''' use named parameters.  (The equals sign gets interpreted as a named parameter otherwise.)

If any parameter's actual value contains characters used for wiki markup syntax (such as pipe, brackets, single quotation marks, etc.), you may need to escape it.  See [[Template:((]] and friends.

Be wary of URLs which contain restricted characters.  The equals sign is especially common.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template provides a quick way to mention an XML-style tag in a preformatted way. Mainly used in discussion/help pages.

=== Usage ===

*'''first parameter''' — ''(mandatory)''  the name of the HTML tag
*'''second parameter''' — what type of tag to display:
**&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;pair&lt;/code&gt; – ''(default)'' display a matched pair of open-and-close tags: {{tag|font|pair}}
**&lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; – display only the opening tag of an open-and-close pair: {{tag|span|open}}
**&lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt; – display only the closing tag of an open-and-close pair: {{tag|span|close}}
**&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;single&lt;/code&gt; – display a single tag: {{tag|br|single}}
*'''content=''' — the text content of the tags
*'''params=''' — any parameters to be included in the opening tag

====Examples====

* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tag|ref}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{tag|ref}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tag|ref|content=hello}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{tag|ref|content=hello}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tag|font|content=foo}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{tag|font|content=foo}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tag|font|open}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{tag|font|open}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tag|font|open|content=hello}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{tag|font|open|content=hello}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tag|span|close|content=hello}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{tag|span|close|content=hello}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tag|span|pair|content=hello}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{tag|span|pair|content=hello}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tag|ref|open|params=group=note}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{tag|ref|open|params=group=note}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tag|references|single}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{tag|references|single}}
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tag|br|single}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{tag|br|single}}

==Update==
{{tl|editprotected}}
Can the code be updated to the following? This ensures proper display of the &lt;tt&gt;single&lt;/tt&gt; XHTML tags (added a space), and makes &amp;#123;&amp;#123;{content}}} also show with &lt;tt&gt;open&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;close&lt;/tt&gt;. Updated code from [[:en:Template:Tag]]. [[User:Edokter|Edokter]] ([[User talk:Edokter|talk]]) 15:45, 14 January 2011 (UTC)

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mohawk's orthography was standardized in 1993, but before that texts on Mohawk used many different scripts. For this course, we'll use the standard orthography, though as you'll learn this can differ based on dialect (see below)

==Vowels==
Mohawk has 6 vowels, 4 &quot;oral vowels&quot; and 2 &quot;nasal vowels&quot;. The &quot;oral&quot; vowels are:

====Oral Vowels====
* '''A''': pronounced like the ''a'' in f''a''ther
* '''E''': can be pronounced either like the ''e'' in g''e''t or the ''a'' in f''a''te. When it is a long vowel (see below) it is always pronounced like the ''a'' in f''a''te, and when it is a short (normal) vowel, it is usually pronounced like the ''e'' in g''e''t
* '''I''': pronounced like the ''i'' in pol''i''ce
* '''O''': pronounced like the ''o'' in n''o''te

====Nasal Vowels====
Nasal vowels have no equivalent in English. However, anyone who took French classes should know about nasal vowels, for example the ''en'' in the French word for dog, chi''en''. Nasal vowels are vowels which are said partially through the nose as well as the mouth. Many english speakers find this to sound like a half-pronounced N.

For example, listen to the pronunciation of the French word ''l'eau'' (meaning &quot;the water&quot;, pronounced &quot;low&quot;) here:
*http://www.phonetics.ucla.edu/vowels/chapter14/french7.aiff
And then listen to the pronunciation of the French word ''long'' (meaning &quot;long&quot; but pronounced &quot;lo''n''&quot;, the ''n'' being nasalized)
*http://www.phonetics.ucla.edu/vowels/chapter14/french14.aif

Notice that the 2 examples are pronounced the same, except for that &quot;half-pronounced N&quot; at the end of ''long''. That is nasalization.

To make that sound, try pronouncing the word &quot;owe&quot;. Notice that when you say that word, the back of your tongue doesn't touch the roof of your mouth. Now try to say the word owe again, but touch the back of your tongue to the roof of your mouth as you say it. The result should be &quot;o''n''&quot;, a nasalized O.

You can nasalize any vowel like this, by pushing your toungue against the roof of your mouth while you say that vowel.

In Mohawk the nasal vowels are:

*'''En''': pronounced like the ''u'' in h''u''t, only nasalized
*'''On''': pronounced like the ''oo'' in b''oo''t, only nasalized.

===Length===
In Mohawk you have to distinguish between long and short vowels, unlike in English. The difference is simple, how long you say the vowel. Like in English, the ''e'' in b''e''t is short, but the ''ee'' in str''ee''t is long. 

In Mohawk you indicate this with a colon (:). For example, ''kaná:ta'' (town) and ''rón:kwe'' (man). Notice that with a nasal vowel the colon comes after the N.

You should hold long vowels for about half a second, as opposed to the fraction of a second given to short vowels.

===Tone===
Tone is another part of the Mohawk language that doesn't occur in English. Tones are very common in Asian languages, such as Chinese and Thai. 

In English, as in all European languages, tones are used extensively during singing and tones often sound like singing to English speakers. Think of tones musically, as in the commonly know musical scale Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do. In that example Do is a low tone, and Fa is a high tone.

Listen to the following example, with the syllable ''ma'' pronounced the in 4 tones of Mandarin Chinese. 
*:{{Audio|zh-pinyin_tones_with_ma.ogg|The syllable &quot;ma&quot; pronounced with the four main tones}}

==Usage==
'''You should not put quotation marks around the quote. This template acts as a [[w:pull quote|pull quote]] to separate it from the text instead.'''


*&lt;big&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{quotation|quoted material|Author|Title|Publication}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
{{quotation|quoted material|Author|Title|Publication}}

*&lt;big&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{quotation|quoted material|Author||skip italics to use '' '' for italics}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
{{quotation|quoted material|Author||skip italics to use '''&lt;nowiki&gt;'' ''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' for italics}}

*&lt;big&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{quotation|quoted material|Author|Title|}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
{{quotation|quoted material|Author|Title|}}

*&lt;big&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{quotation|quoted material}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
{{quotation|quoted material}}

===The equal sign (=)===
If any of the parameters include an equal sign, this will make the template not recognize the parameter properly. To fix this the parameter needs to be prefixed with &quot;1=&quot;, &quot;2=&quot;, etc., depending on which parameter this applies to.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Features and Facilities of Window Managers =

The features and facilities that are provided by various window managers include:

== autohide ==

An autohide facility enables menubars to disappear when the pointer is moved away from the edge of the screen.

== borders ==

A border is a window decoration component provided by some window managers, that appears around the active window. Some window managers may also provide a border around background windows.

== context menu ==

Some window managers provide a context menu that appears when an alternative click event is applied to a window manager component or desktop application widget.

== iconification ==

An iconification facility enables running applications to be minimized to a desktop or taskpanel icon.

== joined windows ==

Some window managers provide a joined windows facility that enables application window frames to be joined together.

== keyboard equivalents ==

Some window managers provide keyboard equivalents that enables functionality provided by the mouse to be replicated by a keyboard equivalent.

== menubar ==

Some window managers provide a menubar that gives the facility to launch programs using a menu. The menubar may contain additional facilities including a startbutton, a taskbar, and a systemtray.

== menupanel ==

A menupanel is a component of some window manager systems that provides the facility to launch programs using a menu. The menupanel may contain additional facilities including a startbutton, a taskpanel, and a systemtray.

== mouse focus ==

The mouse focus model determines how the pointing device affects the input focus within the window manager. A windowmanager can use various focus models to determine which component of the graphical user interface is currently selected to receive input as the pointer is moved around the screen.

== mouse warping ==

A [[mouse warping]] facility centres the mouse pointer on the current application as it is made active.

== multiple desktops ==

A reparenting window manager may provide a multiple desktop facility. This enables several rootwindows to be used, and a facility to switch between desktops. This prevents clutter of the rootwindow, because applications can be run from different desktops.

== pager ==

Some window managers provide a pager tool that provides the facility to switch between multiple desktops. The pager may appear as an onscreen window or as a gadget in the taskbar or taskpanel.

== plugins ==

Some window managers have a modular construction, enabling [[/plugin/]] modules to be used to provide features as required.

== root menu ==

The root menu appears when the root window or desktop background is touched.

== rollup ==

A rollup facility enables windows to appear as just a titlebar on the desktop.

== shortcuts ==

A shortcut facility, enables icons to be placed on the rootwindow, which can be used to access specific programs or facilities.

== start button ==

A start button is a desktop widget that provides a launch facility via a menu of programs. The start button is typically placed on a menubar at the bottom of the screen.

== system tray ==

A [[system tray]] is used to displays icons for system and program features that have no window on the desktop. It contains mainly icons to indicate status information and notifications such as arrival of a new mail message. Some systems may also show a clock in the system tray.

== tabbed windows ==

A tabbed windows facility enables applications to be grouped together to share common frames.

== task switching ==

The window manager may provide various task switching facilities , to enable selection of the currently focused application, including:

* mousefocus
* keyboard shortcuts
* taskbar
* taskpanel

== taskbar ==

A taskbar shows running applications. The taskbar may show all applications that are running including those that have been minimized, and may provide the facility to switch focus between them. The taskbar may be incorporated into a menubar on some window managers.

== taskpanel ==

A taskpanel is similar to a taskbar, but appears as a floating panel, rather than a horizontal or vertical bar.

== title bar ==

A titlebar is a window decoration component provided by some window managers which appears at the top of each window. The titlebar is typically used to display the name of the application, or the name of the open document.

== title bar buttons ==

Some window managers provide title bar buttons which provide the facility to minimize, maximize, rollup or close application windows. Some window managers may display the titlebar buttons in the taskbar or taskpanel, rather than in the titlebars.

== virtual desktop ==

A virtual desktop (also called a scrolling desktop ) is a facility that enables the desktop to be larger than the actual screen.

== wallpaper ==

A wallpaper facility enables a background picture to be displayed in the root window.

When I edit tutorials I try to seperate everything into smaller units with good spacing, line flow, and headings; so that the average noob, by reading one small step at a time, can follow it. 
If their is more than one way to do somthing, and someone has taken the time to write steps in a way that is not like a discussion (must be in 3rd person ) then I will keep them in the main page, and differeniate them as method 1, method 2, etc, otherwise it's going to the discussion page, with the rest of the user discussion, and Q&amp;A, that I find on the main page.

== Maybe... ==

Maybe you could ask for editor rights at [[WB:RFP]] before you are autopromoted. I did the same thing. As we all know that you are a good user, we can trust that you will not do any malicious editing. This will save recent changes patrollers a lot of time. Thanks for taking time to read this comment.

You may be interested in [[WB:RFP|Thenub314's request for CheckUser permissions]]. Regards [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 11:03, 19 August 2010 (UTC)

== Undeleted Images ==

Hi Pearts,

I don't think these actually qualify as freely licensed by virtue of being screenshots from GPL'd software.  These icons appear to be original creations ''using'' Blender, but are not really something you'd see in Blender without inserting considerable original creativity.  Of course, I had no way of knowing that until they were undeleted.  

If we allowed the argument that anything created in Blender counted as a screenshot, I think we'd be crossing a line.  Do you know who really created these images?  All we really know is who uploaded them originally.

My recommendation is that someone (you being the ideal candidate) create replacement images and upload those to the Commons.  This just seems too dodgy. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 12:52, 3 September 2010 (UTC)

:Actually half of the images that are of the logo, already had the &quot;free to use&quot; attributions and are over at the commons already...  it's just these few that where left out in the cold. [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 12:56, 3 September 2010 (UTC)

::OK!  I'm willing to let them stand then.  I still think it would be a good idea to move them to the Commons though.  The only images we allow here are &quot;fair use&quot;, and those require a rationale. Of course it's impossible to copy them over if they are deleted, but that's been taken care of now. Thanks again! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 12:58, 3 September 2010 (UTC)

::I have a deal with admin Adrignola, whenever he/she sees a catagory called blender 3d screenshots pop up, with &quot;move to commons&quot; as the only reason for creation, he/she will get them moved enmass, as his/her time permits. Their are alot of miscatagorized blender 3d screen shots that are still floating around here at wikibooks, but as I work thru the pages, I am getting them moved. [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 13:05, 3 September 2010 (UTC)

:::Technically Blender screenshots with original work in them need to be marked as GPL ''and'' the license for the original work present in them.  If I had been a stickler for that with all the screenshots moved to Commons, maybe half the images used in one of our most popular books would have been deleted.  I've looked at existing screenshots at Commons and the admins there are not very strict on that either.  But now that they are moved to Commons, the admins can deal with them if/as necessary. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:15, 3 September 2010 (UTC)

== September 2010 ==
[[File:Information.svg|25px|link=]]  We welcome and appreciate [[Special:Contributions/Pearts|your contributions]],  but some of your recent actions differ from the way things are normally done at Wikibooks.  [[Using Wikibooks]] can be helpful in learning more about conventions. When using certain templates on talk pages, don't forget to substitute with text by adding '''subst:''' to the template tag. For example, use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:bigwelcome}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead of &lt;nowiki&gt;{{bigwelcome}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This reduces server load and prevents accidental blanking of the template.

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

==Usage==
'''{{tl|Cquote}}''' (for '''Centered pull-quote''') is a template meant for [[w:pull-quote|pull-quote]]s, which stand apart from the text of a page.  

* '''NOTE''': This template should '''not be used''' for [[w:block quotation|block quotation]]s in page text.  For long quotations in the text, use the HTML &amp;lt;[[w:blockquote|blockquote]]&amp;gt; element, such as through the use of the {{tl|quote}} template.
* Pull-quotes work best when used with short quotes, and at the start or end of a section, to help emphasize the content of the section. 
* For shorter pull-quotes of 50 words or fewer in a similar style, consider using {{tl|rquote}} which sets the quote off to either the right or left as in a magazine [[w:Sidebar (publishing)|sidebar]].

===Syntax===
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cquote|quote text}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cquote|quote text|quotewidth=40px}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cquote|quote text|40px|}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cquote|quote text|quote width in pixels||author or speaker|title of article, speech, book, etc.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

;Only the first parameter is required. 
:But since sizes are slotted into the second parameter place by default, to cite a source one must deliberately define dummy parameters for those (abusing the template logic, which expects numbers), or explicitly define the source author and publication as 4= and 5= respectively (using them as named parameters&amp;mdash;the preprocessor takes such fine):

{{cquote|This is one.
|4=Author
|5=Publication}} 


which is generated by:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{cquote|This is one.
|4=Author
|5=Publication}} 
&lt;/pre&gt;
or
&lt;pre&gt;{{cquote|This is one.
|author=Author
|source=Publication}} &lt;/pre&gt;

===Parameters===
; Parameter 1: text of the quote; use &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; between paragraphs.
: '''''Required'''''
: '''Note''': if the quote text contains one or more &quot;=&quot; (equal signs), then the template must be called as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cquote|&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;1=&lt;/span&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;quote text}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; (see [[m:Help:Templates#Equals sign in parameter value|&quot;Equals sign in parameter value&quot;]])
;Parameter 2: &quot;size&quot;, &quot;quotewidth&quot;, or &quot;width&quot; can also be used. - desired size of the quotation marks; defaults to 20px (anything larger than 48px is not recommended). This can be used to scale the graphical [[w:quotation mark|quotation mark]]s up and down to suit larger or smaller quotes.
;&lt;del&gt;Parameter 3&lt;/del&gt;:&lt;del&gt;&quot;quoteheight&quot;&lt;/del&gt; - it was used for desired height of the quotation marks, but no longer.
; author / Parameter 4: Name of the person that wrote or spoke the text being quoted. Can include links.
: '''Note''': if the text contains one or more &quot;=&quot; (equal signs), then the template must be called as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cquote|&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;4=&lt;/span&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;text}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; 
; source / publication / Parameter 5: Source of the quote (publication title, speech, etc.). Can include links.
: '''Note''': if the text contains one or more &quot;=&quot; (equal signs), then the template must be called as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cquote|&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;5=&lt;/span&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;text}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; 
; bgcolor: The color of the background.
; wide: When set to &quot;yes&quot;, the quote expands to the entire width of the page. Useful for small quotes, but may clash with other floating objects, such as infoboxes.

===Examples===
&lt;pre&gt;{{cquote|quote text}}&lt;/pre&gt;
{{cquote|External success has to do with people who may see me as a model, or an example, or a representative. As much as I may dislike or want to reject that responsibility, this is something that comes with public success. It's important to give others a sense of hope that it is possible and you can come from really different places in the world and find your own place in the world that's unique for yourself.|4=[[w:Amy Tan|Amy Tan]]}}

&lt;pre&gt;{{cquote|1=quote text}}&lt;/pre&gt; (quote text contains an equal sign)
{{cquote|1=The essential point, established by Lorentz, is that the equations of the electromagnetic field are not altered by a certain transformation (which I will call by the name of Lorentz) of the form&lt;sup id=&quot;refQLT1904&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[#endnoteQLT1904|2]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;x^\prime = k\ell\left(x + \varepsilon t\right),t^\prime = k\ell\left(t + \varepsilon x\right),y^\prime = \ell y,z^\prime = \ell z, k = 1/\sqrt{1-\varepsilon^2}.&lt;/math&gt;}}

&lt;pre&gt;{{cquote|quote text|40px}}&lt;/pre&gt;
{{Cquote|You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney and to have an attorney present during questioning. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided to you at no cost.  During any questioning, you may decide at any time to exercise these rights, not answer any questions, or make any statements.|40px}}

&lt;pre&gt;{{cquote|quote text|30px||Origin of quote|Cited source}}&lt;/pre&gt;

For example:

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:scroll&quot;&gt;{{cquote|And when they've given you their all / Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy / Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall.|30px||[[w:Pink Floyd|]]|''[[w:The Wall|]]''}}&lt;/pre&gt;
is rendered as

{{cquote|And when they've given you their all / Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy / Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall.|30px||[[w:Pink Floyd|Pink Floyd]]|''[[w:The Wall|The Wall]]''}}

Example with ref tags:

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:scroll&quot;&gt;{{cquote|You don't get everything you want. A dictatorship would be a lot easier.|200px||George W. Bush&lt;ref&gt;http://www.governing.com/archive/1998/jul/bush.txt&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/pre&gt;

{{cquote|You don't get everything you want. A dictatorship would be a lot easier.|200px||George W. Bush&lt;ref&gt;http://www.governing.com/archive/1998/jul/bush.txt&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE. --&gt;

'''{{tl|rquote}}''' (for '''Reduced pull-quote''') is a variant of the {{tl|cquote}} quotation template, intended for relatively short [[w:pull quote|pull quote]]s of  50 or 100 words. It results in a floating quote with the page text wrapping around it, like an image.

For longer pull quotes, especially those which are more than a paragraph, or are longer than the rest of the paragraph they are quoted in, a similar effect (across the page) can be produced by  [[:Template:Cquote|Cquote]]. For long quotations in the text, use the HTML &amp;lt;[[w:blockquote|blockquote]]&gt; element or the {{tl|quote}} template (which produces the blockquote tag).

{{TOCright}}
==Usage==
Align quote box to the '''right''':

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Rquote|right|Quote text|Origin of quote|Cited source}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Align quote box to the '''left''':

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Rquote|left|Quote text|Origin of quote|Cited source}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''You should not put [[w:quotation marks|quotation marks]] around the quote. This template serves as a [[w:block quote|block quote]] to separate it from the text instead.'''

==Parameters==
# '''Alignment''' (''left'', ''right'').
# '''The Quote Text'''
# '''Source''' (who said it?)
# '''Citation''' (where was it said?)

==Example==
===Align Right &amp;rarr;===
====Code====
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rquote|right|
This is an example pullquote with the first option set to ''right''.|
[[w:Anonymity|Anonymous]]|''Rquote template page''}}{{Lorem Ipsum}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
====Result====
{{rquote|right|
This is an example pullquote with the first option set to ''right''.|
[[w:Anonymity|Anonymous]]|''Rquote template page''}}{{Lorem Ipsum}}

===Align Left &amp;larr;===
====Code====
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rquote|left|
This is an example pullquote with the first option set to ''left''.|
[[w:Anonymity|Anonymous]]|''Rquote template page''}}{{Lorem Ipsum}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
====Result====
{{rquote|left|
This is an example pullquote with the first option set to ''left''.|
[[w:Anonymity|Anonymous]]|''Rquote template page''}}{{Lorem Ipsum}}
{{clear}}

=== Usage ===
This template is for [[w:Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]]s or [[w:pull quotes|pull quotes]] meant to stand out, not for regular long quotations. The difference from {{tl|quote}} is that the {{tl|epigraph}} attribution has the same text size as the quote (instead of being slightly smaller).

The ''quote'' parameter is required.  The ''cite'' parameter is optional.  Cut-'n'-paste:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{epigraph
| quote =
| cite =
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Examples ====
&lt;pre&gt;
{{epigraph
| quote = The tank of the Spanish Civil War: T-26B
| cite = Lucas Molina Franco
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Result'''

{{epigraph
| quote = The tank of the Spanish Civil War: T-26B
| cite = Lucas Molina Franco
}}

'''With a note'''

&lt;pre&gt;
{{epigraph
| quote = The greatest caution must be used in deducing general lessons from this war: a little adroitness and it will be possible to use it to “prove” any preconceived theory
| cite = Anonymous British attaché to the Spanish Republic&lt;ref&gt;Zaloga, [http://libraryautomation.com/nymas/soviet_tank_operations_in_the_sp.htm&quot;Soviet Tank Operations&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h1&gt;Overview of eXist search funtions and operators&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In catching up with updating from eXist-1.2.6 to eXist-1.4.x, one thing struck me. Despite eXist's elaborate documentation, I was feeling a bit lost in the myriad of overlapping search functions and their modalities (both default and fallback behaviours). I think I would feel helped with an overview grouping the different search-related functions in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if this could be interesting to complete the eXist documentation; at this stage, however I'm not too sure about all functions, and maybe others may see more interesting approaches for such an overview. Therefore, I thought maybe the Wikibook could be an interesting place for such information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table below provides an overview, with following colour codes: &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;I'm not 100% sure -- all clarifications welcome!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: red;&quot;&gt;not in eXist function documentation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Shemot/Exodus 27:20 – 30:10;  Ezekiel 43:10-27;  Romans 12:1-13:14, Philippians 4:10-20

This week’s parasha deals almost entirely with the selection of the Kohanim/Priests, the garments they wore, and the inaugural service by which they and their offspring would become confirmed for all time as special ministers of Yahweh.   

THE HIGH PRIEST'S CLOTHING
Yahweh told Moshe to make expensive clothing for the Cohen. This he was told to do before Aharon or his sons were allowed to present themselves before Him. Looking at the materials used in the clothes of the Cohen Gadol (High Priest) we see richness and finery far beyond what the average person would wear.  The vestments were made of gold and precious jewels as well as the finest possible cloth.  Additionally because the blue in his vestments looks like the blue in the sky, a connection is established between him and the heavenly throne of God.   Everything in the garments had a spiritual significance.   None of the priests were fit to serve in the Temple unless he was wearing the sacred garments.  These garments are essential in order for the priests to function in their sacred capacity; so much so that in their absence, the offerings made by the priests in the Temple had no validity! As the Talmud states, “While they are clothed in the priestly garments, they are clothed in the priesthood; but when they are not wearing the garments, the priesthood is not upon them” (BT Zevachim 17:B).  The garments elevated them to the high levels of sanctity required from those who come to serve before God in the holy place.


After the sin of Adam and Eve in Gan Eden, Yahweh 'clothed them';  in this week's Torah portion, Moshe is commanded to 'clothe Aaron and his sons' in not just anything he designed, but as Yahweh instructed in the finest clothing available, wearing fine ornate jewelry and being cleansed and even perfumed in the prescribed manner.   How much more should we apply these things to our physical and spiritual walks, before presenting ourselves to Him?

A picture is being painted for us, we are not to come to Him without blood sacrifice, the anointing of the Spirit and our priestly vestments should be beautifully ornate representing the spiritual garments which He has given us  -  holy garments to perform His service and not doing it in our own 'garments'  -  our own energies and capabilities.

Despite the splendour and beauty of these priestly robes, it still took the blood of the korban (offering) and the oil of the Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit), to make Aharon acceptable before Yahweh.  None of us are exceptions, no, not one!  Our good deeds or position or station in life can not make us acceptable before a holy (kadosh) God.  Many people are trying to come to Yahweh by fulfilling the mitzvot (commandments) or by their charity and prayer but without applying the blood and the oil and their efforts are futile.  Not Until we apply the blood shed for us by the Messiah Yeshua, and we apply the oil of the Ruach HaKodesh are we acceptable to appear before Yahweh, no matter how righteous our lifestyle.   
It is these and these alone that make us holy/kadosh in His eyes.


THE MENORAH THE LIGHT IN THE TEMPLE

Now you shall command the Children of Yisrael that they shall take for you pure olive oil, pressed for illumination, to kindle a lamp continually. In the Tent of Meeting, outside the Partition that is near the testimonial-tablets, Aaron and his sons shall arrange it from evening until morning, before Yahweh, an eternal decree for their generations, from the Children of Yisrael.

The word tetzaveh, “to command,” also means “to connect” and “to bond.” Thus the verse can also be read as God saying to Moshe: “And you shall bond with the Children of Israel.”  Shemot/Exodus 27:20-21

Moshe is being given a charge of authority, from Yahweh, to take control over the Children of Yisrael and instruct them regarding the requirement of bringing only pure olive oil for the menorah.   The menorah was to burn before Yahweh from evening till morning every day, without exception. Great care was given in gathering the olive fruit from the tree. In order not to injure the crop or the tree, it was gathered either by hand or by shaking the fruit off carefully with a light stick.   It was only the third crop of the harvest on the inner branches which was used for the Menorah because it had ripened slowly and had no dross in it.  It was carefully cleansed and carried to a press, which was considered the best method of obtaining oil from the fruit.  In order to make oil, the fruit was made by hand pressing each olive gently until only one drop of pure oil emerged.  The olive oil used in the Tent of Meeting for the menorah had to be free of sediment or debris.   

It was only lit once a day, in the afternoon, at the same time as the evening sacrifice in the outer court.  
The word “continually”, in Hebrew “tamid”, is used in Exodus 29:42 and Numbers 28:6 regarding the daily sacrifice. In Exodus 25:30, it is used for the bread placed before the Eternal once a week.

The seven lamp stands were cleaned in the morning and the new oil was poured in, in the afternoon.  It was calculated how much oil was needed for the menorah to burn throughout the longest night of the year. The same amount of oil was used all year around, which meant that the lamps burned even after the sunrise on the shorter nights of the year. The longest night in Yerushalayim is approximately fourteen hours long and the shortest is approximately ten hours long.   If the illumination from the menorah was to reflect Yahweh’s image, it would therefore be appropriate that anyone or anything that was to be used in His presence should reflect His Holiness.  Pure oil from the olive therefore symbolized the Ruach (Spirit) of Yahweh, and the burning of this oil in the menorah would shed forth Yahweh’s marvelous light.   This is a picture of the pure oil of the Spirit shining forth through His anointed corporate vessel - His witness upon earth - His holy nation, the kingdom of priests.


A NEW WAY OF THINKING

Until now, Yahweh had spoke to Moshe saying, “Speak unto the Children of Yisrael,” and tell them what thus says Yahweh.  But here, Yahweh tells Moshe  “Now you shall command the Children of Yisrael that they shall take for you pure olive oil, pressed for illumination, to kindle a lamp continually.”  (Exodus 27:20).  This is the only example in the bible with Moshe being told by Yahweh to command the Children of Yisrael.  Each of the other examples found in the Tanach shows that Yahweh spoke to Moshe to speak unto the Children of Yisrael.  Moshe now takes on the duty of Pastoral care for the Children of Yisrael, and it is of importance for His leaders to understand that their charge is to ensure there is a daily supply of oil in each vessel by feeding the flock and teaching obedience to Yahweh’ written word.   “That He might present it to Himself a glorious Assembly, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.”   Ephesians 5:27

Moshe had placed the Children of Yisrael’s well being before his very own life. It was Moshe’ duty to guide and instruct the Children of Yisrael and to present them before Yahweh without spot, wrinkle, or blemish.  Likewise, Yahweh had committed Himself to the Children of Yisrael through His promises.  Moshe, exemplified here, was a type of groomsman or pastor.   It is the job of a groomsman/pastor to keep the bride chaste and without blemish.
“And He gave some apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers. For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Messiah.”   Ephesians 4:11-12


OBEDIENCE; BEING A WISE VIRGIN    Matthew 25:1-13

The Children of Yisrael metaphorically speaking, are likened to virgins.   You could not separate the two groups in the parable as they were identical, but for one significant exception.   Each of the ten was identified as a virgin; each of the ten had all come together for the same purpose.   The ten virgins were for all intent and purpose identical in their appearance; however, there was one significant difference with that difference being that five of them chose the path of disobedience. They all knew that someday, sooner than later, the bridegroom was coming.   All of the Children of Yisrael were required to have a daily supply of oil with which to light the menorah in the temple.  Five of the virgins decided to be obedient and equip themselves with the prescribed daily supply of extra-virgin olive oil for their lamps, while the other five for one reason or another did nothing in immediate preparation.   Perhaps, they were too involved with the cares of this world and forgot to prepare for the world to come, or just maybe it was not expedient to be diligent each day, or they just did not care.   But for reason or another,  they did not prepare themselves to provide the daily oil which was needed for the menorah to burn in the presence of Yahweh in the temple.  Exodus 27:20   

The oil for the temple was not to be sold, but it was something that each person was to prepare and contribute.   The olives were provided from vineyards that were set aside for the purpose of this provision for the temple.    It was not a requirement to pay for the olives to prepare the oil, but it was necessary for your heart to be submitted to labor towards this daily task.  We must put in the preparation each day to ensure that our lives are illuminated by His Spirit.

In the preparation of the oil, the olive gives its yield only when it is pounded, and so the light of His presence will only come forth from us when the flesh has been broken and crushed, then the oil of His Spirit will ooze out and become that which can be ignited and used to shine forth His glory.   In this process, our egos and rebellious natures — “our own heart and our own eyes,” are crushed into pulp and discarded, leaving the Spirit within to shine forth through the broken ‘clay’ vessel.   Our perspective is shortsighted during our trials, not seeing the value of the glory of His Presence which will be revealed through our crushed flesh

The Children of Yisrael were to walk in the marvelous light of truth and salvation.  Nothing was to be hid from them - the word of Yahweh was not for private interpretation, but for all Yisrael’s ear to hear.   If we were to rehearse His word daily in our lives and were to allow His ways to become our ways at all seasons, we indeed could walk in that marvelous light and be a light for all the world  - a spiritual city that sits high on a hill for all to see.

&quot;The light of the body is the eye: if therefore your eye be single your whole body shall be full of light. But if your eye be evil, your whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you be darkness how great is that darkness!&quot;  Matt.6:22

“But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light; for whatsoever does make manifest is light”.  Ephesians 4:13


THE PRIESTLY MINISTRY
&lt;u&gt;Incense&lt;/u&gt;  
The incense altar was located in the centre of the tabernacle and it was here that man approached Yahweh and began to enter into communion with Him by means of the incense which would arise and form a link between man below and God above.   Our prayers ascend as incense before Him linking us into a communion with Him.

Yahweh said to Moshe for the construction of the Incense Altar,  “You shall overlay it with pure gold, the top of it, the sides of it around it, and its horns; and you shall make a gold molding around it.” (30:3 HNV) 
“You shall put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with you.” (30:6  HNV)  

“Aharon shall burn incense of sweet spices on it every morning. When he tends the lamps, he shall burn it.” (30:7 HNV) -  also, “When Aharon lights the lamps at evening, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Yahweh throughout your generations” (30:8 HNV)

In the Scriptures, incense represents knowledge, as it is written in 2 Corinthians 2:14-15,     “Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Messiah, and reveals through us the sweet aroma (incense) of his knowledge in every place. For we are a sweet aroma of Messiah to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish” (HNV revised)

The burning of incense each morning and each evening symbolizes praying with understanding.   Revelation 5:8; 8:3-4
Sacrifices offered on the brass altar symbolize prayer in the spirit.   That teaches us the importance of praying both with the spirit and with understanding every morning and every afternoon.  (1 Corinthians 14:15)
This is the reason for the practice of praying morning and evening at the time when the morning and evening sacrifices were offered in the temple.  These are our priestly offerings unto Yahweh.
        
&lt;u&gt;The Ephod&lt;/u&gt;
&quot;And they shall make the ephod of gold [thread], blue, purple and scarlet [wool], and fine twined linen, artistic work.&quot;

The ephod resembled an apron worn backwards, so that it covered the back of the wearer from above the waist down to the ankles and overlapped in the front. A sash tied in the front beneath the heart, and two bands extended up the wearer's back to his shoulders.  On the ends of these bands (which rested on the shoulders of the wearer) God tells Moshe to place two shoham (onyx?) stones in gold settings. The stones should be engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel: &quot;six of their names on one stone, and the other six names on the other stone, according to their birth.&quot;  Thus as God's representative. he carried Israel upon his shoulders when he went before Yahweh.

When Aharon was clad in the blue ephod robe, he was carrying out a prophetic action, which showed that the Messiah would rise through the heavens after the resurrection.   &quot;He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by the knowledge of himself shall my righteous servant justify many; and he shall bear their iniquities.&quot;(Isaiah 53:11 HNV)  

Just as the High Priest bore the names of the 12 tribes on his shoulders and well as having them engraved upon the stones which were upon his heart, our High Priest and Messiah,  has His people upon His heart as a remembrance (28:12) and upholds them with His strength and carries them to their eternal destination. Tiller says that,  &quot;When a shepherd rescues a lamb he carries it upon his shoulder; so the infinite strength of Messiah  is capable of bearing us until we reach heaven's fold&quot;   Tiller op. cit. p.36  &quot;Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.&quot; (Hebrews 7:25 HNV revised)  Hebrews 9:24-28 tells us that Yeshua has entered into heaven itself on our behalf of which the earthly tabernacle and all its procedures was a representation.   There He makes intercession for us.   Romans 8:34

Since Messiah carries the names of the children of Israel on his shoulders, there is a constant memorial before the Father of his death for us all.  The fifty days correspond with the fifty letters of the names of Israel's sons that are on the Messiah's shoulders.  In regard to the breastplate, hertz says that &quot;The stones on his heart are Aaron's silent prayer to God  on behalf of his entire people&quot;     Hertz op. cit.342   Tiller suggests that the Messiah &quot;continually bears our names as He ministers in the presence of God for us&quot;  (op. cit. p.34)  The whole ministry of the High Priest Aharon, which also includes his clothes, speaks of the ministry that the Messiah has from the time of his resurrection until this day. This is the reason that the Torah goes into all the details of the clothes of the High Priest. 

Aharon's head was over the blue robe, and his body was under.  In the same way, the Messiah, who is the head of His body, sits above the heavens in His High-priestly ministry of intercession for Israel, while His body ministers upon earth  The Messiah's ministry according to the order of Malki-Tzedek was also given to his talmidim, fifty days after his resurrection, on Shavuot, when the Spirit was poured out, as we see in Acts chapter two.

&lt;u&gt;The Breastplate&lt;/u&gt;
The breastplate was called choshen mishpat, the &quot;breastplate of judgement&quot; (Exo 28:15). It was decorated with jewels and gold.  A rectangular piece of fabric (woven of the same materials as the ephod) should be folded in half to make a square pouch measuring half a cubit by half a cubit (approximately 10 inches x 10 inches).  Upon its front, in gold settings, twelve gemstones should be arranged in four rows
According to the Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 2:7), the colorings of the stones were as follows: Reuben's stone, odem, was red; Simeon's stone, pitedah, was green; Levi's stone, bareket, was white, black and red; Judah's stone, nofech, was sky-colored; Issachar's stone, sapir, was dark blue; Zebulun's stone, yahalom, was white (lavan, which can also mean clear); Dan's stone, leshem, was of a similar hue as that of the sapir; Gad's stone, shvo, was gray; Naphtali's stone, achlamah, was the color of clear wine; Asher's stone, tarshish, was &quot;the color of the precious stone with which women decorate themselves&quot;; Joseph's stone, shoham, was black; Benjamin's stone yashpei, had the colors of all twelve stones.
In addition to the names of the tribes, the stones also contained the words, &quot;Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Shivtei Yeshurun ('righteous tribes'),&quot; so the Breastplate should contain all 22 letters of the Holy Tongue (Talmud)
Rashi says that it is called &quot;breastplate of judgment&quot; because it confirms the message given by the urim and tummim,  see Numbers 27:21.  

&lt;u&gt;The Urim and the Thummin&lt;/u&gt;  
“You shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Tummim; and they shall be on Aharon’s heart, when he goes in before Yahweh: and Aharon shall bear the judgment of the children of Yisra’el on his heart before Yahweh continually.&quot;(28:30)  The Hebrew word “urim”, the plural of “ur”, means “flames”, “light”.  The Hebrew word “tummim”, the plural of “tam”, means “fulfillments”, completions”. Talmud[Yomá 73b] says, “Why were they called ‘urim and tummim’? ‘Urim’, because they caused the words to light up, and ‘tummim’ because the words were fulfilled.&quot;

According to Rashi “urim ve-tummim” is the name of a piece of parchment where Yahweh’s Name was written. The parchment was placed inside the double-layered breastplate, and it caused the letters to light up and be fulfilled when they gave about important things that concerned the whole nation, see Judges 20:27-28; 1 Samuel 23:9-12.

Usually translated as ‘lightings and perfections,’ since the message shone forth and was then perfected by the High Priest.  The Urim and Thumim would be consulted like an oracle; the High Priest would meditate on the stones until he reached a level of divine inspiration.  He would see the breastplate with inspired vision, and the letters containing the answer would appear to light up or stand out.  With his divine inspiration, the High Priest would then be able to combine the letters to spell out the answer (Yoma 73b; Ramban; Bachya - Nu.28:21; cf. Handbook of Jewish Thought 6:36).  Josephus writes that when the Israelites went to battle, the stones would shine forth with great splendor as a sign of victory (Antiquities 3:8:9).

Urim and thummim, therefore, represent the will of the Eternal.  Urim - light, reveals his will. Tummim - fulfillments, enables man to fulfill his will.  In the Melchizedek ministry which Yeshua established for today, urim and tummim are within the heart of the priest.  His only longing is for the will of the Eternal to be fulfilled.  

His priests today have the voice of the Spirit in their inner man to light the way and give them direction in the specifics of life as the Urim and Thummin.   This inner guidance can come through meditation or by a definite ‘witness of the Spirit’ and even as an audible voice at times.  Therefore as priests subject to His guidance we wait upon Him for His direction in the affairs of this life.
His Presence can be manifest when His people follow the divine pattern and walk in fellowship with Him.   

&lt;u&gt;The Tzitz&lt;/u&gt;
&quot;You shall make a head-plate of pure gold, and you shall engrave upon it, engraved like a signet ring, 'Holy to Yahweh.' &quot; (28:36)  The Tzitz was a band which the Kohen Gadol, the High Priest, wore across his forehead.  Engraved into this band, pressed in from the back so as to appear in relief, coming out from the band, were the words &quot;Kadosh Yahweh,&quot;   i.e. - Sanctified to Yahweh.  He wore it affixed to his forehead by a single blue strap. By bearing the name of God upon his head, the high priest was symbolically invested with the authority of that name. Like a king’s servant bearing the signet ring of the king, the high priest was God’s official agent on Earth.

&lt;u&gt;The Golden Altar&lt;/u&gt;
The last ten verses of Tetzaveh describe the Golden Altar -  &quot;And you shall make an altar for the burning of incense; of shittim wood shall you make it. A cubit shall be the length of it and a cubit its breadth, foursquare shall it be, and two cubits shall be its height; the horns thereof shall be o the same.&quot;  &quot;And you shall overlay it with pure gold, its top, and its sides round about, and its horns; and you shall make for it a rim of gold round about...&quot;
Like the other Vessels, the Golden Altar should have rings and carrying poles to transport it. It should be placed in the center of the outer chamber of the Sanctuary, &quot;before the Veil (Parochet) that is by the Ark of the Testimony.&quot; The Golden Altar should be used only for the twice-daily burning of the Ketoret (incense):   &quot;And Aaron shall burn upon it sweet incense every morning: when he dresses the lamps, he shall burn incense on it. And when Aaron lights the lamps at evening, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before God throughout your generations.&quot;

Once a day each year, however, the Golden Altar served an additional function: On Yom Kippur, the High Priest sprinkled the blood of the day's special offerings on its &quot;horns.&quot;   &quot;Once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy to God.&quot;

The Levites served in the courtyard.  If one views the set up of the Tabernacle in a “verticle” fashion (with the Holy of Holies being at the top), it can be said that the Levites were “below” the incense altar.  Thus the souls of men (corresponding to the teaching level of the Levites) are also “under the altar.”   Consider that the “souls of the saints,” in the book of Revelation (whose prayers are mixed with incense), are seen as located “under the altar.&quot;

All the priests were to wear head coverings as a sign of submission.   The Talmud teaches “cover your head that the reverence of heaven be upon you”   The practice of not going about bareheaded at any time has become a mark of Jewish piety.

Initially, kohanim (priests) served before Yahweh in the Tent of Meeting; they would later serve in the first as well as second temples.  It had always been the hope of Yahweh that the children of Yisrael would be unto Him a kingdom of priests, a holy nation which is being fulfilled in the new covenant.

“But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.”

“And you shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation,”   I Peter 2:9-10 &amp; Exodus 19:6

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have a very large form and your initial load times are very long.  You want to be able to break a large form into multiple forms.

== Method ==
To get the first part of a large form to load we will break the form into multiple parts and only load what appears to be the first tab of a multi-part form.  When the user selects the second tab we will save all the data on the first tab and load the second tab.  This way if the user want to only make a simple change to the form only the logic for a single tab needs to be loaded.

== Example ==
We will use a series of triggers that are styled as file tabs.  Each trigger will perform two actions: it will run a save submission and it will then load the next part of the form.  The forms will be styled so that it will appear to the user they are just changing tabs.

Here is the sample code from each of the triggers:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:trigger appearance=&quot;minimal&quot; class=&quot;tab2&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xf:label&gt;Part 2&lt;/xf:label&gt;
    &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xf:send submission=&quot;save&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;xf:load resource=&quot;edit-2.xhtml&quot; show=&quot;replace&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/xf:action&gt;
&lt;/xf:trigger&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
{{TOCright}}

The template {{tl|anchor}} inserts one or more [[w:HTML element#Anchor|HTML anchor]]s in a page. Those locations can then be linked to using &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[#link|...]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; syntax.

===Examples===

1. &lt;code style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{lc:{{BASEPAGENAME}}}}|foo&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
: could be linked to with &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[#foo|...]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; from within the same page, 
: or it could be linked to with &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;small&gt;pagename&lt;/small&gt;''#foo|...&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; from other pages and from redirects.

2. Anchors can be more suitable for inter-page linking than section titles are. For example,
:&lt;code style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;=={{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{lc:{{BASEPAGENAME}}}}|foo&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;color:gray;&quot;&gt; Section title &lt;nowiki&gt;==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:Here, links via &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''articlename''#foo&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; would remain valid even if the section were renamed.

3. The template can be used to create up to ten anchors with a single call. For example,
: &lt;code style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{lc:{{BASEPAGENAME}}}}|foo|bar|baz&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; 
:will create three anchors that can then be linked to with &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[#foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[#bar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[#baz]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. 
:Specifying more than 10 anchors will cause an error message to be displayed.

===Limitations===
* Anchor names that contain [[w:Number sign|&amp;#35;]] (hash), [[w:Vertical_bar|&amp;#124;]] (pipe), [[w:Equals sign|&amp;#61;]] (equal) will not work as expected. Most other characters, including white space and punctuation are not a problem.
* The template can create a maximum of 10 anchors. Specifying more than 10 anchors will result in an error message.
* Putting each anchor name on separate lines, for example
:&lt;code style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{lc:{{BASEPAGENAME}}}}
:|humpty&lt;br /&gt;|dumpty&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; 
:will probably not work as expected.
* Anchor names should be unique on a page, and should not duplicate any heading titles. Duplicate anchors won't work as expected since the #links go to the first anchor with that name. Duplicate anchors also result in invalid HTML, so you can check for duplicate anchors by consulting the [[w:W3C Markup Validation Service|W3C Markup Validation Service]].
* If the template is added to a section title then the code will appear in the edit summary when that section is edited, as in &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;/* {{anchor|Issues}}Limitations */ New issue&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This can be fixed by deleting the template code from the edit summary before the changes are saved.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template can be used to quickly create a [[Wikibooks:Userboxes|userbox]] for display on a user's user page without having to know HTML or Wikitable syntax.

=== Usage ===
&lt;!-- Abstract usage of the template, one variable per row. --&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
{{userbox-r
| border-c = border color
| border-s = border width in pixels
| id       = id text or image
| id-c     = id background color
| id-fc    = id font color
| id-s     = id text size
| id-p     = id cell padding space
| id-lh    = id line height 
| id-op    = id other parameter (CSS)
| id-w     = id box width
| id-h     = id box height
| info     = info text
| info-c   = info background color
| info-fc  = info font color
| info-s   = info text size
| info-p   = info padding (distance between cell contents &amp; cell border)
| info-lh  = info line height (or distance in between text lines)
| info-op  = info other (CSS) parameter(s)
| usercategory  = user category (optional)
| usercategory2 = user category (optional)
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
* Text size is assumed to be in [[w:Point (typography)|points]]
* If border-c is not specified, id-c will be used
* All parameters are optional

=== Example ===

=== Basic details ===
Most HTML-based tables only use a handful of these attributes. The following subset can be used to quickly convert an HTML userbox into the format used here.

&lt;pre&gt;{{userbox-r
| border-c = 
| info-c   = 
| id-c     = 
| id-fc    = 
| id-s     = 
| id       = 
| info-fc  = 
| info-s   = 
| info-lh  = 
| info     = 
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

'''A1. Uhrenfabrik Furtwängler''' (FV-5), February 1923.
: The stamp consists of upper and lower sections separated by the post office name.
: The upper section is the frank with DEUTSCHES REICH above a frame.
: The lower section is a rectangular frame with piano key-like projections at right and a serial number reading down. Inside the frame is the mailer's identification and/or the meter number. 
:  Meter numbers all have “A” prefix. Meters known are A1, A3-11, A15-16, A18-19, A23, A25-27, A30, and A32. 
:  The stamps were printed through a ribbon and are almost universally very weak. Most are in red but a very few are known in purple. 
: Removed from service in November 1923.

[[File:Germany stamp type A2.jpg|left|450px]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''A2. Bafra, Anker-Werke''' (MV)1923. 
:  Horizontal rectangular die with “Deutsches Reich” in panel at top and two parallel lines in panels at bottom and sides. 
:  Two machines, both used by the state Finance Ministry.
::::::::::::::::::: '''A. Bafra''' (MV). Below the frank is the mailer's identification, meter number &quot;B1&quot;, and a large impression counter number. In use 17 March to 19 April 1923.
:::::::::::::::::::: V/F: M000 (G) [[File: MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|8px]][$400]
::::::::::::::::::: '''B. Anker-Werke''' (MV). Below the frank is an impression counter number, the mailer's identification (boxed), and meter number “C1”. In use February to August 1923.
:::::::::::::::::::: V/F: M000 (O) [[File: MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|8px]][$350]

[[File:Germany stamp type A3 note.jpg|right|235px]]
&lt;br&gt;
'''A3. Bafra, Francotyp''' (MV), June 1923.
: Octagonal frank with &quot;DEUTSCHES REICH&quot; at top and parallel lines at bottom. 
: The post Office identification and mailer's identification are below the frank.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: '''A. Bafra''' (MV). Meter number B1, “Berlin N 39/ Schering”, with 4-digit impression counter number. Used between June and July 1923. [[File: MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|8px]]V/F: M000 (A) [[File: MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|8px]][$250]

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: '''B. Francotyp''' (MV). Without meter number, “Berlin 02” above boxed “COMMERZ UND PRIVAT BANK”. Used between March and April 1924. [[File: MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|8px]]V/F: 0000 (A) [[File: MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|8px]][$300]

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: '''C. Francotyp''' (MV). Without meter number, “Berlin W8/ Dresdner Bank/ Behrenstr. 35-39”. Used between March and April 1924. [[File: MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|8px]]V/F: [[File:MeterCat 5-point asterisk.jpg|12px]]000 [[File: MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|8px]][$250]




'''NOTES''':
* In July 1923 Bafra, Anker and Furtwängler merged into a new company called Francotyp which produced meters under that name starting in 1924.
* Proofs similar to Type A3C exist from before the merger when the manufacturer was still identified as Anker. The stamp differs from A3C by having meter number &quot;C1&quot; below the mailer's identification. The stamp (shown at right) was never used on actual mail in this format. [[File: MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|8px]][$350 for the proof]

[[File:Germany stamp type A01.jpg|right|660px]]
[[File:Germany stamp type A01 D1 D2.jpg|right|670px]]
In early 1923 Erich Komusin prepared a range of postage meters for testing. These were the first multi-value (MV) meters, i.e. they could print any postage value from 0001 to 9999. These machines were not officially sanctioned or approved by the German postal authorities and so are considered essays. However during the test period, which ran from January to at least October 1923, some franked mail, probably with the cooperation of the Hamburg postmaster, was posted by Komusin's manufacturer Guhl &amp; Co. to themselves. At least two mailed covers are known to survive. The stamp from one of the mailed covers is shown at right and is postmarked 15 January 1923. The other was mailed on 10 September 1923. The stamps are versions '''B''' and '''J''' respectively. Other versions may also have been used unofficially on actual mail.

The stamps are similar to Type A4 with octagonal die inscribed “DEUTSCHES REICH” at top but instead of parallel lines they have a currency indicator at the bottom. The meter number is either below the frank or vertical at right, and the (proposed?) mailer's identity is at left with a six-digit impression counter number reading down at far left. Instead of a mailer's identification sub-variety '''B''' has wavy lines at both left and right and may have been a continuous design.

The value of a proof is perhaps $250-300. The value of one of the mailed covers is uncertain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Major changes==
* Add TFTP service. It is accessible via 'Services|TFTP' in the WebGUI.
* Add Samba patch CVE-2008-4314.
* Upgrade nano to 2.0.9.
* Upgrade PHP to 5.2.8.
* Add WOL support for misc NIC's. Thanks to Tobias Reber for porting WOL patch to FreeBSD 6.4.
* Upgrade nfe driver. Thanks to Tobias Reber for backporting FreeBSD 7.0 driver and adding WOL support.
* Finally fixed Samba lock file problem (they are located in /var/db/samba now). You can increase the memory filesystem size for /var for LiveCD and 'embedded' installations by modifying the rc.conf variable named 'varsize'. This is necessary if you are running out of file space for *.tdb files (this normally happens on heavy Samba share usage with many users). The default size is 32MB.
* Replace FTP server pure-ftpd 1.0.21 with proftpd 1.3.2rc3. Please note that there can be set additional options via rc.conf variables which are not displayed in the service WebGUI. Please have a look into /etc/rc.d/proftpd script for a detailed list of options.
* Add TCP Wrappers. All applications linked against libwrap support this feature, for example services like FTP, TFTP, SSH, NFS... The rules can be configured via WebGUI 'Network|Hosts'.
* Upgrade ATAidle to 2.4.
* Upgrade transmission to 1.42.
* Upgrade rsync to 3.0.5.
* Upgrade cdialog to 1.1.20080316.
* Upgrade msmtp to 1.4.17.
* Add ability to create a SWAP partition during installation.
* Enhance the 'System|Advanced|Swap' page to select a file or disk device as swap space.

==Minor changes==
* Set date in email-header when sending email.
* Add WebGUI link 'Help|Forum' to FreeNAS forum hosted on Sourceforge.
* Refactor 'Access|LDAP' WebGUI. Now it is possible to add additional options to ldap.conf via WebGUI.
* Add *.divx file extension support to Fuppes (UPnP server) (FR 2400097).
* Add FTP bandwidth limit for local and anonymous users (FR 1860459).
* Add PHP PDO SQLite3 support (FR 2352505).
* Display service state (running/stopped) in 'Services|Status'.
* Add exit status for send_email function in email.subr (BR 2422479).
* Add nfsstat for NFS diagnostics (FR 2093184).
* Do not display links for files in Quixplorer file view.
* Add knobs to the fusefs rc.d script (NTFS support) to safely wait until all data has been written on shutdown. To enable this feature you have to set the rc.conf variables 'fusefs_safe=YES' and 'fusefs_safe_evil=YES' in 'System|Advanced|rc.conf'.
* Display CPU temperature and frequency in 'Status|System' page (FR 2480272). The frequency levels are displayed as tooltips. Please note that these values are not displayed if FreeBSD is not able to get these hardware informations via sysctl.
* Update translation files. Thanks to all translators contributing to FreeNAS.

==Bug fixes==
* The 'default gateway' entered during the console setup is not set without doing a reboot (BR 2406068).
* Fix file size bug in Quixplorer (BR 2445421). PHP can not get correct file size for files larger than 2GB. See http://de.php.net/manual/en/function.filesize.php for detailed description.
* iSCSI-Target target configuration should only accept one extent or device as storage (BR 2454804).
* If 'Hard disk standby time' is set for a drive, the execution of ataidle is delayed to prevent drives to spin up again during the boot process because ataidle immediately spins down the drives on execution. The delay value (default is 60 seconds) can be modified via 'ataidle_delay'  rc.conf variable (BR 2471158).
* Get SNMP module 'netgraph' working. Fixed by adding missing kernel modules.
* Static IPv6 ifconfig is set correct now in rc.conf.
* QuiXplorer incorrectly copies permissions (BR 2491739).
* WebGUI filechooser reports incorrect file size for files &gt; 2GB (BR 2499277).

* Upgrade transmission to 1.40.
* Introduce new WebGUI look (fixes some MSIE rendering bugs also).

==Minor changes==
* Add UPS service WebGUI option to define shutdown mode.
* Add option 'Use sendfile' to 'Services|CIFS/SMB|Settings'. Some users report problems with this option (which is enabled by default), so now it is really easy to disable it.
* Check if configured port is already used (e.g. UPnP, Bittorrent, DAAP, ...).

==Bug fixes==
* Fix web server security hole (file .htpasswd was downloadable) (BR 2255936).
* Re-enable fuppes transcoding support (BR 2276571).
* Remove garbage at end of downloaded log files (BR 2309257).

== What are Linear Equations? ==

In the [[Algebra/Functions|functions]] section we talked about how a function is like a box that takes an independent input value and uses a rule defined mathematically to create a unique output value.  The value for the output is dependent on the value that is put in the box.  We call the values that are going into the box the independent values or the domain.  We call the values coming out of the box the dependent values or the range.  

Unless we specify differently, on Cartesian graphs the domain is the real numbers.  In the  [[Algebra/The_Coordinate_(Cartesian)_Plane|Cartesian Plane]] section we saw how running different values through a function to identify the points on the Cartesian plane by picking the first (x) value of the point the domain and the second (y) value from the range.  To restate this: by convention the two variables for a function on the Cartesian Plane are x for the domain, the independent variable, and y for the range, the dependent variable.  The variable y is the same as writing f(x).  Mathematicians recognize this equivalence but generally prefer to write y because its shorter.  Because a function definition has an input and an output it must also contain an equal sign.  The section in this book [[Algebra/Solving_Equations| solving equations]] showed the various operations we can perform on both sides of an equal sign and still maintain the notion of equivalence.  In this section we plug different values into the independent variable and solve to find the associated dependent variable. For instance if we start with the equation:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y = x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;''We can add a -x to both sides to get the equation''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y -x = x - x &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;''which we then simplify to''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y -x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 

&lt;center&gt;''Or we can add a -y to both sides to get the equation''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y -y = x - y &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;''which we then simplify to''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;0 = x - y&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 

&lt;center&gt;''Since &lt;math&gt;y -x = 0  \equiv 0 = x - y&lt;/math&gt; then:''&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y -x = 0 = x - y&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt; ''Using the transitive proeperty'' &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y -x  = x - y&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt; ''adding x + y to both sides gives us''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(y -x )+( y + x)  = (x - y) + (y + x)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;''using the associative property we change this to'' &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(y - y )+( x + x)  = (x - x) + (y + y)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt; ''which simplifies to'' &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 2x  = 2y &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;''And divide both sides by 2'' &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 2x/2  = 2y/2 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;''To simply reverse the order and show'' &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We have not really proved anything mathematically above, but these operations allow us to manipulate equations to get the dependent variable by itself on one side of the equals sign.  Then we can plug numbers into the independent variable to discover the function values for those numbers.  Then we can draw these values as points on the Cartesian plane and get a feel for what the function would look like if we could see all the points defined by the function at once.

== &lt;math&gt;y=0x&lt;/math&gt; ==
Equations of the form y&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are linear functions of the general form y&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;b where slope m&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and the constant C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; '''is''' the y-intercept b (in the general form).  The graph of this zero-slope function is a straight horizontal line, intercepting the y-axis at C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, including zero and extends infinitely in the positive and negative directions for all '''R''' values of x (see the following diagram). 
 
[[Image:Y=constant.PNG|y = c, where c = 3]]

The domain for such functions is '''R''' covering all real numbers (unless otherwise specified), but the range is just the set {&amp;nbsp;c&amp;nbsp;}.  The equation y&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is the x-axis.

== &lt;math&gt;0y=x&lt;/math&gt; ==
Equation x&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x is one single value C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and y, being unrestricted, is every '''R''' number. The graph of x&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a straight vertical line where x&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, covering '''all''' positive, negative and zero values of y (see the following diagram).

[[Image:X=constant.PNG|x = c, where c = 3]]

Its domain is set { C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; } and range is set '''R''' (unless otherwise specified). x&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is technically not a function (there is more than one value of y for each value of x), but it's a relation. Vertical lines have '''no''' slope (m&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;divide by zero, undefined, plus and minus infinity). These are the only types of linear equations of the general form shown previously which are not linear functions.  The equation x&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is '''exactly''' the y-axis. Lines with steepness approaching vertical have very large-magnitude slopes but are still functions.

== CONTINUE ==
We are going to start by looking at simple functions called  '''linear equations'''.  When none of the instances of x and y in the algebraic expression defining the function rule have exponents then all the instances of x and y can be combined into just two occurrences.  the graph of the expression can be represented as a straight line.  The equation that expresses the function is considered a '''linear equation''' with two variables.  The following equation is a simple example of such a linear equation:  

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;y - x = 2 \, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Since y is the dependent variable it is standing in for the function.  We can re-write the expression as f(x) - x = 2.  If we add an x to both sides the equality property holds and we get the expression f(x) - x + x = x + 2.  Simplifying we get f(x) = x + 2.  In the following table we'll pick 3 values for x, and then calculate the dependent (y) values from f(x).
{| align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;25%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
! ''x'' value
! ''y'' value (abscissa)
! Coordinates &lt;br&gt; (x,y)
|-
| -1 || 1 || (-1,1)
|-
| 0 || 2 || (0,2)
|-
| 1 || 3 || (1,3)
|}


where x and y are variables to be plotted in a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate graph as shown here:

[[image:3ptsyeqxpl2.png|324px]]

[[image:Y equals x plus 2.PNG]]

This function is equivalent to the previous example of a linear equation, y - x = 2.  The arrows at each end of the line indicate that the line extends infinitely in both directions.   All linear functions of a single input variable have or can be algebraically arranged to have the general form:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; y = f(x) = m x + b \, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


where x and y are variables, f(x) is the function of x, m is a constant called the '''slope''' of the line, and b is a constant which is the ordinate of the '''y-intercept''' (i. e. the value of y where the function line crosses the y-axis).  The slope indicates the steepness of the line.  In the previous example where y = x + 2,  the slope m = 1 and the y-intercept ordinate b = 2.  The y = mx+b form of a linear function is called the '''slope-intercept form'''.

Unless a domain for x is otherwise stated, the domain for linear functions will be assumed to be all real numbers and so the lines in graphs of all linear functions extend infinitely in both directions.  Also in linear functions with all real number domains, the range of a linear function will cover the entire set of real numbers for y, unless the slope m = 0 and the function equals a constant.  In such cases, the range is simply the constant.

Conversely, if a function has the general form y = mx + b or if it can be arranged to have that form, the function is linear.  A linear equation with two variables has or can be algebraically rearranged to have the general form&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; A x + B y = C \, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


where x and y represent the linear variables, and the letters A, B, and C can represent any real constants, either positive or negative.  Conversely, an equation with two variables x and y having that general form, or being able to be arranged in that form, would be linear as long as A and B are not both equal to 0.  In the preceding equation, capital letters are to avoid confusion with other constants  in this chapter and for consistency with Reference 1. 


If one divides the preceding equation by B (when B is not 0) and solves for y, the following form can be obtained:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; y = (-A/B) x + (C/B) \, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


If one equates -A/B to the slope m and C/B to the y-intercept ordinate b, it can be seen that the general form for a linear equation and the slope-intercept form for a  linear function are practically interconvertible except for the fact that, in a linear function, the B constant in the linear equation form cannot equal 0.</text>

Is this really a good way of describing it? Sure, Russia's economy has arrived in some approximation of capitalism by the 1990s, but this sentence seems to give the wrong impression, that capitalism was an inevitable outcome of the train of events set off in 1914. Or is this a mistype for &quot; ... rocky road toward communism&quot;?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
This section describes some recent empirical research investigating the question of why some US states employ road tolls to a greater degree than others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Levinson, D.M. | year=2005 | title=Why States Toll:  An Empirical Model of Finance Choice | journal=Journal of Transport Economics and Policy | volume=35 | issue=2 | pages=223-237 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20053868}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The use of toll roads across US states as a revenue source is rather uneven.  Several states receive no revenue from tolls, while others (particularly New York and New Jersey), receive a sizable share of their highway revenues from tolls.  

From a political economy perspective, tolls may seen by governments as a way to pass the costs of financing transportation links on to non-residents.  For example, when road links in a jurisdiction serve a large share of &quot;pass-through&quot; traffic (trips with neither an origin nor destination in the jurisdiction), the jurisdiction may employ tolls in order to capture revenue from non-residents.  

A classic example of this phenomenon can be seen in the case of the [[w:Delaware Turnpike|Delaware Turnpike]].  Situated along [[w:Interstate 95|Interstate 95]] between Baltimore and Philadelphia, the Turnpike is only 11.2 miles long and carries a large amount of traffic bound for destinations outside the state of Delaware.  It is noted that this section of toll road has the highest per-mile [[w:Delaware Turnpike#Tolls|tolls]] (35.7 cents per mile) of any toll road in the US, a sign that it is perhaps exploiting a position of market power in order to extract rents from out-of-state travelers.  

A related observation is that some states with a relatively large share of non-resident workers (&quot;labor importers&quot;) make more extensive use of tolls.  For example, New York City has a large number of workers that commute from northern New Jersey daily.  Those who drive or carpool are likely to encounter bridge or tunnel tolls at one of several crossing points along the Hudson River.  It is worth noting in this case, however, that some of these facilities are owned and operated by the [[w:Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|port authority]] that serves the two neighboring states.  By analogy, these types of tolling policies may be seen as a sort of [[w:beggar thy neighbour|beggar-thy-neighbor]] policy in which the tolls function similarly to tariffs and the tolling jurisdiction seeks to improve its economic position at the expense of its neighbors.

== Research Questions ==
States have the right to impose tolls, yet not all of them do, and among those that do there is significant variability in the degree to which tolls are employed.  This section investigates three related research questions empirically using data from the 50 states. 
* What are the explanatory factors that influence levels of toll use?
* How significant are they?
* What would happen if transportation powers were decentralized to metro areas or counties?

== Hypotheses ==
Several variables are hypothesized to affect the share of state highway revenues accounted for by tolls.  One variable that is thought to be central to the preference for tolls is the share of &lt;i&gt;non-resident workers&lt;/i&gt; in a state.  This variable is expected to positively influence the use of toll in a given state.  In other words, a state that imports much of its labor from a neighboring state is more likely to adopt tolls in order to capture revenue from non-residents.  Since non-residents cannot vote, the use tolls allows a state to, in a sense, &quot;tax foreigners living abroad&quot;.  Conversely, a state with fewer non-resident workers is more likely to get most of its revenue from taxes.  Since more travel is likely to be &quot;local&quot; in the sense that origins and destinations lie within the state's borders, there is less opportunity for [[w:Free rider problem|free riding]] by non-residents.  The use of taxes rather than tolls also generally implies lower losses due to collection costs.

A state's use of tolls also is anticipated to depend on the &lt;i&gt;policy decisions of neighboring states&lt;/i&gt; regarding the use of taxes or tolls.  For example, if a state exports some of its labor to neighboring states (i.e. has residents working in neighboring states), those workers may end up paying tolls to the neighboring state(s).  The home state of those workers may retaliate by adopting tolls itself in order to recapture some of the revenue.  The choice of neighboring states to adopt tolls would be expected to have a positive influence on a state's use of tolls, though this effect would be smaller relative to the effect of non-local trips (non-resident workers).  This is due to the fact that tolls in a labor-exporting state will disproportionately affect its own residents.

These incentives are illustrated in the figure and table below.  The figure shows a stylized representation of the problem  in terms of the residence and workplace locations of citizens in neighboring states.  In the figure there is a single road link connecting a state to its neighbors.  The table shows a matrix of possible outcomes in terms of incentives to toll or not toll the road, depending on the combination of residential and workplace locations of residents.  The matrix shows possible residential locations corresponding to points A and C in the figure, and workplace locations corresponding to points B and D.  If the residents live at C and work at D, a case in which residence and workplace are in the same state, then there is no incentive to toll since most trips are local.  If the residents live at C, but some work at B (out of state), a situation corresponding to some exporting of labor, then there is a small incentive for the state to toll in order to recapture some of the lost revenue.  Next, consider the situation where some workers live outside the state at A, but work at D (non-resident workers).  In this case there is a moderate incentive to toll in order to capture the revenue from non-resident workers.  Lastly, there is the case where residents live at A, but work at B.  In this case, where both the residence and workplace are located outside the state, but are served by the road link running through it, there is a large incentive to toll in order to capture revenue from non-local travelers (recall the Delaware Turnpike example).

&lt;i&gt;Population&lt;/i&gt; of a state is hypothesized to have a positive influence on the share of revenues from tolls as well.  States that are more populous may have more congestion and higher costs for building and maintaining highways.  They may thus require more revenues from tolls, especially if they are smaller in terms of land area.  Also, states with large cities may be more likely to import workers than states that are more rural.

An important control variable in the empirical model is the &lt;i&gt;historical use of tolls&lt;/i&gt;.  It is observed that much of the toll road mileage in the US is concentrated in the northeastern states.  These states historically have contained many of the centers of population in the US.  The imperative of connecting these population centers with high-performance highways in response to the growth of auto and truck fleets led to the development of many toll-financed highways prior to the advent of the Interstate Highway System.  Many of these highways were grandfathered into the Interstate System, but remained as toll facilities.  Thus, the share of revenues from tolls in many states depends on the extent of toll roads during the period prior to the commencement of major work on the Interstate network, a sort of &quot;historical inertia&quot; effect.  In order to measure the effect of historical toll miles, a variable is constructed by calculating the ratio of toll miles in 1963 (when the Interstate program took full effect) to miles of limited access highways in 1995.  The variable measuring historical toll miles is expected to have a large and positive effect on the share of revenue derived from tolls.

* Share of Toll Revenue Can be Explained by:
* Non-Resident Workers (+)
* Neighboring States’ Policies (+)
* Historical Factors (Miles of Toll Road before Interstate Era) (+)
* Perceptions of Toll Incidence
* Toll Incentives

== Data by State ==
The data used to fit the empirical model represent a cross-section of 49 US states for the year 1995.  Alaska is excluded from the analysis, because although its data identify the Alaska Marine Highway as a highway toll, the service is actually a ferry.  Thus, retaining data from Alaska would potentially introduce a source of bias into the analysis.  The District of Columbia is also excluded, since it does not have independent authority over its own roads.  

The major variables in the data set are reproduced in the table below, along with a correlation matrix of the variables.  Note that the data include a variable measuring the percentage of land in a state that is federally owned (&quot;Federal Land&quot;).  This variable is intended to capture the effect of states designated as &quot;public lands&quot; states under the Interstate Act.  States with such a designation were eligible for 95 percent federal financing of its sections of interstate highway, as opposed to the 90 percent threshold applied to other states.  Given that the Interstate Act required federally funded roads to be free of tolls, the &quot;public lands&quot; states had additional incentive to use non-toll sources of revenue to finance their highways.  Since this variable was found to be statistically insignificant in the estimation of the model, it was dropped from the final model specification.

== Results ==
The results of the estimation of two different models are reproduced below.  One model contains the variable N, the &quot;neighbor state&quot; or &quot;neighbor toll&quot; effect, the other does not.  The neighbor state variable measures the share of revenue from tolls in each of a state's neighbors weighted by the share of that state's residents commuting to those neighbors.  As the fit of the two models suggests, this variable is a statistically significant predictor of the share of a state's revenue derived from tolls, though its explanatory power is not very large.  Both models have adjusted R-squared values of around 0.60, indicating that the models explain about 60 percent of the variance in the dependent variable (share of revenue from tolls).

All of the variables in the models are statistically significant at the p &lt; 0.10 level or less.  Since the independent and dependent variables are structured as percentages, their coefficients can be interpreted as [[w:Elasticity (economics)|elasticities]].  For example, the coefficient on the variable for imported workers (non-resident workers) in Model 1 is about 0.85, indicating that each one percent increase in a state's share of non-resident workers is associated with a 0.85 percent increase in the state's share of revenues derived from tolls.  An exception to this interpretation is seen with the neighbor state variable (N), which has an intrinsically non-linear structure.  

In terms of practical significance, the historical toll miles variable (ratio of 1963 toll miles to 1995 limited access highway miles) is the most important predictor, followed by state population size, non-resident workers, and the variable capturing the neighbor state effect.

The model does a fairly good job of predicting the shares of revenue derived from tolls in each of the states.  As a test of the policy implications of the model, it is also applied to counties and metropolitan areas in California to see what might happen under a regime of more decentralized highway finance and governance.  Model 2, the model excluding the neighbor effect variable, is applied to data on counties and metropolitan areas.  The effect of toll bridges in the San Francisco Bay Area are not counted as historical toll road mileage, and so this variable essentially takes on a value of zero.  The counties and metro areas therefore vary primarily in terms of population size and cross-border flows.  

The results show that decentralizing authority over highways to metropolitan areas has little effect on the adoption of tolling.  Only one metropolitan area, Stockton, has a predicted share of revenues from tolls of over 10 percent.  However, once the unit of analysis is reduced to the county level, the results are more dramatic.  Several counties have predicted shares of toll revenue exceeding 20 percent, with a maximum value of 34.5 percent observed in San Francisco.  This prediction for San Francisco matches reality fairly well, as there are toll facilities at two of the entrance points to the city (the Golden Gate and Bay Bridges), as well as fairly expensive, city-owned parking in the central business district -- another possible way to collect revenue from non-residents.  It should be noted though, that the Golden Gate bridge is owned by an [[w:Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District|independent authority]] and the Bay Bridge is managed by the [[w:Bay Area Toll Authority|Bay Area Toll Authority]] and maintained by [[w:Caltrans|Caltrans]].  Another observation is that Orange County, the county with the highest predicted share of revenues from tolls in the Los Angeles region under the county-level simulations, is a county that makes extensive use of tolls as a revenue source.  The county owns the [[w:91 Express Lanes|SR-91 Express Lanes]] on the Riverside Freeway and also participates in the [[w:Transportation Corridor Agencies|Transportation Corridor Agencies]], a joint-powers authority that oversees the planning and financing of the county's three other toll roads.

== Conclusions ==

The empirical model describing states' use of tolls as a source of highway revenue shows that toll use depends positively on cross-border flows, neighboring state tolls, the historical use of tolls to finance limited access highways, and population size.  Applying this model to smaller jurisdictions, as was done with the simulations for California counties and metropolitan areas, reveals that devolving authority over highways to metropolitan areas is insufficient to induce significant adoption of direct road pricing in the form of tolling.  However, under more radical forms of decentralization, such as devolving authority to counties, the use of tolls may become more widespread.  This is due primarily to the effect of creating a greater degree of cross-border flows by bringing jurisdictional control down to a lower level of government.

After much struggling to follow many tutorials based on older versions of Blender, I have downloaded multiple versions to discover why the tutorials based on versions such as 2.43 don't work when attempted on updated versions such as Blender 2.48a and above. Newer versions such as 2.48 have added a new option to '''/not/''' have added objects rotated to the current viewpoint.  With older versions, being in top, front or side view would cause any newly added objects to face different directions on creation.  

[[File:Aligned_to_view.jpg|thumb|500px|The location of the button to make the circle show up in the correct orientation]]

Newer versions of Blender introduced the ability to force all objects into the same global orientation; even worse, they set it up that way '''BY DEFAULT'''!  This means that unless the user deliberately changes the settings in the new versions, many older tutorials will act as if they are broken.

Newer versions of Blender (such as version 2.48, or 2.49b ) can be set to act in the same way as the older versions, by setting the '''Align to view''' on the '''&lt;big&gt;(i): &lt;/big&gt; USER PREFERENCES''' menu in the right way.  

Making this simple changes will &quot;unbreak&quot; tutorials written under Blender version 2.43, by allowing new objects to be automatically oriented to whatever viewscreen orientation is selected in the active viewscreen.  

Any time object rotations, lattices or whatever else end up completely out of alignment with what older tutorials say should happen, these steps are your first best fix for almost every such situation.



'''&lt;u&gt;In 2.58 and 2.61&lt;/u&gt;'''

The settings mentioned above are found in &quot;File-&gt;User Preferences&quot; (shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+U) under the &quot;Editing&quot; tab. There's a drop-down called &quot;Align To&quot; where you can set &quot;View&quot; or &quot;World&quot;.

{{clear}}


'''Noob Note:''' What actually happens by default on newer versions of Blender is that the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the screen. It means that, instead of revolving around the vertical axis, the object will revolve in the plane of the screen. Another way to deal with this is to change the view just before performing the rotation (I used '''NUM1''' view) and come back to '''NUM7''' once done.

'''Noob Note:''' In version, 2.63 for Linux, after changing &quot;Align To&quot; to &quot;View&quot;, when adding through &quot;Add&quot; menu, the mesh will still be aligned to &quot;World&quot;. To get it aligned to &quot;View&quot; You have to add it with '''SHIFT-A'''.

'''Noob Note:''' In version 2.68a (unknown for older versions) there is a option to Align newly created mesh individually.
When you create a mesh, (for ex. cylinder) there is a panel beneath the toolbox panel(left side of the 3D view) that shows up: Add &quot;Mesh Name&quot; (ex. Cylinder). Scroll down a bit and you'll see a check-box to enable &quot;align to view&quot;. Checking it will align the mesh you added to the current view. Re-checking it after rotating the view around will align the mesh to new view.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The graph of an equation represents all the points for which that equation are valid.  The points where the different graphs intersect show the points that are valid for more than one equation in a system.

== Author ==
The original author of this text is [[User:Ricardoramalho|Ricardoramalho]]

''Dedicated to Wikibooks''
[[File:Tai Chi, Cannon Beach.jpg|thumb|right|250 px]]

== Preface ==
In the modern occidental society, where ambition and capitalist culture are the accepted norms and anxiety is common, doing nothing is not well tolerated or comprehended, especially outside of academic and artistic environment. In our everyday lives we are all immersed in a vicious cycle of behaviors and attitudes.

The concept of ''inaction'' is more common in oriental societies. The Daoist concept of [[w:Wu-wei|Wu wei]] is related to the ability to know when to act. That is also an important element in the classic [[w:The Art of War|The Art of War]] the applications of which extend outside the military to business management.

== Doing nothing is a skill ==
The development of good timing is very important in group work. It requires attention, and concentration.

== A cure for the sedentary life: Do nothing ==
Sedentary (that which is characterized by little movement) work can cause problems. A common solution is to increase activity levels but these often fall short of adding valuable experiences. Another is to reduce stimuli. Meditation is one technique to clean the mind, and can help clarify thoughts.

== Creative leisure ==
Artists know well: without time out, freedom from work, there is no art. Contemplation is defined by the Merriam-Webster online dictionary as &quot;concentration on spiritual things as a form of private devotion&quot;, or even more interesting &quot;the act of regarding steadily&quot;. The perception of the environment is the main source for artistic creation. An art work also leads to perception. People need art because it exercises our ability to reflect a critical consideration. When we say &quot;he does that very well, he is an artist&quot; we are recognizing that all things can be well done, or not, that somethings are better organized, or better taken care of, than others, that means we have a point of view based in our experience, and attention capacity. When culture is not considered to be worth it, low social standards result. That problem is frequent in undeveloped countries, where violence, corruption, and the majority of the population has low self esteem, and few moral values. The opening of the Louvre Museum in Paris, and the National Gallery in London a few decades after in the beginning of the eighteen century, was a matter of State in each country, a strategy to educate the people, to promote national culture, to display the nation's power and development.

Quality leisure is vital when we are concerned about doing nothing in a healthy way. Most people have TV as their main tool for leisure, many play videogames, while others stay hours in the Internet. Not by coincidence TV, video games and Internet are all monitors. In 2009 all three are available in a cellular phone. These are very important communication and entertainment media, and most people couldn't live or work without them. Quality leisure is about finding balance in the frequency we use this tools, and others. Instead of watching so much TV, have a cup o tea, for example. Notice how equilibrium is important: drinking tea all day can be addictive too. [[w:Chimarrão|Chimarrão]] is a hot drink very common in South America. People drink it while working, or even when walking in the park, or at home. A chimarrão consumer normally drinks in the same moments as a smoker lights cigarettes, they carry a thermos bottle of hot water inside a bag or a basket, everywhere, and the tea is drunk using a shiny metal straw and a cup made of natural gourd (cuia). Some studies have concluded that the excessive and prolonged drinking of chimarrão increases incidents of mouth cancer. Discipline is very important when choosing and maintaining habits, a variety of moderated actions is necessary to make inaction benefit. 

There is no need to be radical on doing nothing, many small tasks can be considered positive to break vicious circles, and enrich life. Meditation every day is a good example: in modern society and stressed cities is something difficult to find time for, people tend to do it not at home, but in gymnasium´s and special classes, so it can be included in a weekly agenda. In Kung-Fu temples, staying awake night and day without sleeping is a type of radical meditation that is done with the eyes open. A monk has to stay in complete isolation to do that: he seems to be doing nothing, but is in guard. That degree of stabilized consciousness is not possible when we ride buses everyday, eat not well in crowded restaurants, and work 8 hours a day in front of a computer, or on the street. That is why it is so important to take good care of the routine to survive well in troubled contexts and keep developing beings for a better society.

== Procrastination ==
Procrastination can be a way not only to avoid to commit to a task but as a way to access priorities and avoid committing errors. It can even help reaching the optimal path for a solution, procrastination doesn't mean not thinking about the task to be done, and since metalization of a problem and possible solutions doesn't get them done it can be a positive reason to put off doing something, but has been scientifically proven that it helps execute physical feats, by working as a way to optimize the neuro-connection needed for the &quot;real&quot; executions of the job. Procrastination isn't always about carelessness or laziness, that can only be attributes that result of not performing on time or as others expect you to. Although the prudence of procrastination is vital to reach personal goals without higher costs, or precipitation, in team work it is important to have a good communication to harmonize concerted actions, or inactions. Procrastination is also an effective defense barrier frequently used by corporations and public services to avoid client complaints and related public demands: after a while, solicitors normally give up. That technique must be used carefully because it can damage the reputation of the procrastinator, generating later higher costs with public relations, and even marketing. In human relationships it is frequent to delay, or not to respond to an undesired call: if we are always available to someone that harasses, the harasser can feel motivated to continue.

It is interesting to notice that in the financial and economic crisis of 2009, in March, an European country that is famous for procrastination and bureaucracy, Portugal, despite of having a quite fragile economy (for also that reason) compared to other European nations, have now a much better unemployment rate than Spain. The aggressive style of the Spanish market, that made it one of the fastest growing economies and one of the richest countries in Europe, exposed them to a higher collapse: their unemployment rates are about 50% higher than the smaller iberic Portuguese neighbor &lt;ref&gt; [http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/eurostat/home/ Eurostat]&lt;/ref&gt;. It is likely that aggressiveness can produce a faster recovery later, though, the instability provoked by precipitation, ambition and over reaction is clear, in many cases.

== Learn with the Indians ==
Isolated jungle Indians, those that still live in the Amazon forest for example, are primitive, but are not considered less civilized than urban populations. Modern social science considers that Indians have a very stable society, with a strong sense of their own cultural values, beliefs, rituals, routine, and necessary skills. Indians have time. They gather a lot, and talk, and listen. So being an Indian is really a life style, and keeping their tradition is a clear option for them nowadays.

== Timing and diplomacy ==
Fishing expeditions, if you overstep your nautical limits can cause stress on relations, especially if others are aware of an already established history of looking for lost nuclear submarines. This is can be aggravated if there is already an extra level of global tension. People should clearly avoid teasing the trained bear, there is so much else to spend time on...
Select to use your time productively or just let things be, your actions will always generate reactions, and they will not be always  predictable.

== Conclusion ==
Doing nothing is part of a consistent strategy of survival, and personal development. It helps you decide, plan, associate with others, enjoy life and enjoy your work. Doing nothing is cool, powerful, and helps building relationship, friendship, organization and conscience. Great productivity can be achieved with time to yourself, and time to your colleagues. When we comprehend somebody, sometimes a good thing is doing nothing. In Japan when people want to show anger, they do nothing, don't talk, don't even look at the person who did something wrong. That is very strong and quite cruel because the person who did wrong knows that, and feels guilty, without room for discussion. Isn't it great to stay with friends doing nothing in a comfortable silence? So, look around you, contemplate the view, breathe carefully, have a glass of water and do nothing today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''static_cast''' keyword can be used for any normal conversion between types. Conversions that rely on static (compile-time) type information. This includes any casts between numeric types, casts of pointers and references up the hierarchy, conversions with unary constructor, conversions with conversion operator. For conversions between numeric types no runtime checks if data fits the new type is performed. Conversion with unary constructor would be performed even if it is declared as explicit. 

;Syntax
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
    TYPE static_cast&lt;TYPE&gt; (object);
&lt;/source&gt;

It can also cast pointers or references down and across the hierarchy as long as such conversion is available and unambiguous. For example, it can cast &lt;code&gt;void*&lt;/code&gt; to the appropriate pointer type or vice-versa. No runtime checks are performed.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
BaseClass* a = new DerivedClass();
static_cast&lt;DerivedClass*&gt;(a)-&gt;derivedClassMethod();
&lt;/source&gt;

;Common usage of type casting
Performing arithmetical operations with varying types of data type without an explicit cast means that the compiler has to perform an implicit cast to ensure that the values it uses in the calculation are of the same type. Usually, this means that the compiler will convert all of the values to the type of the value with the highest precision.

The following is an integer division and so a value of 2 is returned.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
float a = 5 / 2;
&lt;/source&gt;

To get the intended behavior, you would either need to cast one or both of the constants to a '''float'''.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
float a = static_cast&lt;float&gt;(5) / static_cast&lt;float&gt;(2);
&lt;/source&gt;

Or, you would have to define one or both of the constants as a float.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
float a = 5f / 2f;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Backup and restore of OpenClinica ==
Backing up your OpenClinica setup is a must. And not only that: you must practice restoring your backup. You know why, so do it.
Having said these grave warnings: backing up your OpenClinica is simple! There are only two things to backup: your database and your study files.

=== Backing up during the development cycle ===

Make backups at every step in the process so you can backup to an earlier step if you make a mistake (e.g. once you've entered data there's no easy way to delete that data, or delete rules once you've added them).

Backup at these points:

#Empty database
#Study created
#CRFs
#Events
#Rules

As well as making backups, don't forget to make notes on how you've been configuring the study.  Presuming you've been working on a test machine, you'll need to follow this guide when you move the study to a live environment.  The guide could be a spreadsheet with details of the configuration of the 'Create Study' section, and a sheet listing the Events, their configuration and the CRFs in each.

==== Windows backup script ====
The OpenClinica website includes an example of an [https://docs.openclinica.com/3.1/technical-documents/system-administration/backup-and-restore-openclinica#content-title-5156 OpenClinica backup script for Windows].

=== Backup of the database ===
Postgres comes with a number of command line utilities and one of them is pg_dump. This utility makes a (huge) text-file with commands to recreate your openclinica database, plus inserts into all the tables.

Let's say your database is called &quot;openclinica&quot; and you are making your backup on 14 July 2010. In Linux you can log in to your server and type:
&lt;pre&gt;sudo -u postgres /usr/bin/pg_dump -U postgres openclinica &gt; pg_dump_openclinica_20100714&lt;/pre&gt;

The syntax is straightforward: pg_dump, followed by the name of the database and then the name of the dump-file. Make the name of this file as descriptive as possible, so do not use just &quot;OC&quot; or &quot;backup&quot;, and always add a date to it. As a final step you must take your dump-file off the server and store it somewhere safe. And I repeat: do not leave it on your server!

A command to perform something similar in Windows (your paths may vary):
&lt;pre&gt;“C:\Program Files (x86)\PostgreSQL\8.4\bin\pg_dump.exe” --host localhost --port 5432 --username clinica --format custom --blobs --verbose --file C:\oc\backup\pg_dump_openclinica_20100714 openclinica&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Backup of the study (data) directory ===
All your CRF's in XL-format, plus XML-rules files, plus CRF-attached files and also your generated datasets and Metadata-sets are stored in the directory openclinica.data. This directory is located in /usr/local/tomcat/ (or C:\oc\tomcat in Windows). For a complete backup of OpenClinica you should back up this directory to a safe location on a different server.
In Linux you can tar this directory in one line with:
&lt;pre&gt;tar -cvvf oc_data_20100714.tar /usr/local/tomcat/openclinica.data&lt;/pre&gt;
In Windows you can use Explorer to copy the directory.

=== Backup of the application (webapps) directory ===
To take things one step further, you can back up the application directory that can be found in webapps.  The openclinica (or otherwise named) directory is located in /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ (or C:\oc\tomcat\webapps\ in Windows).

==== Just backing up your datainfo.properties ====
Rather than backup the whole application (webapps) directory (which on the whole doesn't change during use), you may want to backup the only file you are likely to have changed - the configuration file datainfo.properties. Usually the information in this file does not change much after the installation of OpenClinica. But in case of a crash, it will save you a lot of time if you have settings like ports and mail-configuration, so in Linux type:
&lt;pre&gt;tar -rf oc_data_20100714.tar /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/OpenClinica/WEB-INF/classes/datainfo.properties&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Restoring the database ===
==== Restoring to a differently named instance ====
If you wanted to restore your original instance (e.g. openclinica) to a differently named instance (e.g. openclinica2), simply restore the data to a differently named database (openclinica2), rename the data directory (openclinica2.data) and webapps directory (openclinica2).  See the [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/MultipleInstances|Multiple Instances]] page for more information (e.g. before restarting the new instance, you may want to amend the logging directory, so that it logs to a different directory from the original instance).

==== Stopping OpenClinica ====
Restores can only be made when the OpenClinica Application isn't using the database. So either OpenClinica application or Tomcat  must be stopped temporarily.  The easiest way may be to use the management pages to stop specific applications ([http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/manager-howto.html Tomcat Manager How-To]).  Alternatively you can stop Tomcat itself (on Windows this can be done via Windows services or the [http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/windows-service-howto.html Windows command line]).

==== Restoring from the dump file ====
To restore the database you will have to delete the existing openclinica database, recreate it and &quot;run&quot; the dump-file.

In Linux you can do this from the command line:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo -u postgres/usr/bin/psql
drop database openclinica 
create database openclinica with encoding='UTF-8' owner=clinica;&lt;/pre&gt;

Then exit psql (\q) and go to the directory where your dump-file is located and type (as user postgres):
&lt;pre&gt;
/usr/bin/psql openclinica &lt; pg_dump_openclinica_20100714&lt;/pre&gt;

This will restore your database.

This process can also be performed in Windows, using the PGAdmin client:

#Open PGAdmin, browse to and right-click on the openclinica database (Object Browser, Servers, Postgres, Databases, openclinica), select ‘Properties’, then Delete/Drop (or Properties and alter the Name if you want to retain current database)
#Right-click on Databases, New Database, Name openclinica, click OK.
#Right-click on the new openclinica database, Restore, find the file and click OK

==== Creating an empty OpenClinica database ====
To create a new, empty OpenClinica database, you can skip the final restore step in the steps above. When OpenClinica starts up, it creates a new database structure in the empty database (including resetting the admin password).  The uploaded files can also be cleaned out by deleting the contents of openclinica.data.

=== Restoring the study (data) directory ===
Restore the data directory to /usr/local/tomcat/ (or C:\oc\tomcat in Windows)

=== Restoring the application (webapps) directory ===
Restore the application directory to /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ (or C:\oc\tomcat\webapps\)

== Donations ==

Reading over your donations, it seems like they are not truly [[WB:WIW|textbooks]] in the sense that we've come to know them at Wikibooks.  Are they collections of works now in the public domain due to age?  If so, then the [[Wikibooks:Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|license]] they are under here at Wikibooks would actually be more restrictive than necessary.  Public domain source documents would actually be a perfect fit at our sister project, [[s:|Wikisource]].  Check out [[s:Wikisource:What_Wikisource_includes|what Wikisource includes]] and see if it would work for your content.  If you decide that Wikisource is a better fit and upload your work there instead, please let me know so I can remove it from here to keep the value of the pages from being reduced on Google due to duplication.  Thanks. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:12, 23 July 2010 (UTC)

Dear Adrignola, I did take your advise but The Demise of an Irish Clan was rejected. I did not get as far as uploading the other two parts of the trilogy. To be honest I really do not know where to go. My invitation to sample my website was totally misrepresented as self promotion. I have tried to explain the true nature of the work - tracing a name, place and outcome - to a family, which happens to be my own. It is unfortunate that my computer needed rejigging. When it was serviced all my references were removed. Frankly I would rather stick with you simply because you are receptive and sympathetic to my work. The only book commercially sold was The Collins of Chard and that was self printed and bound, sold at Weald and Downland Museum. Terence 

:That is unfortunate.  I do notice that [[s:The Demise of an Irish Clan|The Demise of an Irish Clan]] is still around at Wikisource.  My advice if you wish to use Wikibooks is that some things about your books will have to be worked on if they are to survive at Wikibooks.  Copying and pasting them verbatim with no further alterations won't be acceptable.  They must be of textbook material, in that they instruct the reader on a topic, such as the history of a country or group.  If you create pages that simply appear to be a collection of historical anecdotes, someone else may come across and try to push them to Wikisource again.  It will be very important to examine [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?|What is Wikibooks?]] and ensure that anything you place here meets the criteria.  In particular, if these accounts are original research or simply not verifiable, then you could expect the community at Wikibooks to try to push them to [[v:|Wikiversity]], where original research is permitted.  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:08, 12 August 2010 (UTC)

Dear Adrignola, Thank you for your clear appreciation and guidance. As explained The Demise is a brief exposition on possible pre Christian and Early Irish Clan history setting out where the family name came from - the place in Ireland and persons involved. The rest is conjecture [gleened from various historical writings] to give structure, introduction to emigration, and English beginnings. I believe that my work is original and it is based on facts, as far as ancient writings are true and historians reliable. Important Persons and Places are verifiable. Please, would you kindly introduce The Demise to Wikiversity..., and can I tack on some source material, or should I reload the whole again including a source profile at the end. I have seen Pillbox, Shako, and Cap [Rifle Corps] - the third part of the trilogy but cannot remember where. Horse, Tractor, and Van [Victorian Bayswater]can be uploaded if you believe it sensible to plough on. Thank you again for your guidance. Terence[[User:Terence Kearey|Terence Kearey]] ([[User talk:Terence Kearey|talk]]) 21:53, 12 August 2010 (UTC)

:You should be able to log in to [[v:|Wikiversity]] with the same account information as you use at Wikibooks and there should be no problem with contributing there immediately.  You can even decide to have some of your material there and some here, depending on how much conjecture is involved.  If you need me to undelete anything you uploaded to Wikibooks and move it into your user space so that you can upload it to Wikiversity instead, please let me know.  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:33, 12 August 2010 (UTC)

Dear Adrignola, Again I thank you. I have uploaded the intro and first chapter of The Demise to Wikiversity, with added edits. I shall be including acknowledgements after the final chapter. Yes, please delete what you have - for I have made changes. I will keep all the parts of the trilogy together but will take up your offer for The Collins of Chard and Tatworth Village. I shall keep you informed as I go along. Many thanks  [[User:Terence Kearey|Terence Kearey]] ([[User talk:Terence Kearey|talk]]) 23:06, 13 August 2010 (UTC)

Hello Agrignola, Nice to see your name back. I hope the pages go down well. Terence

Good morning. Thank you for your corrections, they are much appreciated. Terence

Dear Adrignola, That concluded Tatworth Village. May I now upload The National Government years, 1931 - 1939, in Metroland, entitled 'Suburb Garden Town'.--[[User:Terence Kearey|Terence Kearey]] ([[User talk:Terence Kearey|talk]]) 12:59, 3 September 2010 (UTC)

Dear Adrignola, Harrypotter suggests 'The Collins of Chard' may suit Wikibooks rather than Wikiversity. Do you believe that to be so, and hopefully, if you do, can you transfer those pages? I did ask if he could arrange that - I am not sure whether that was possible. Sorry for imposing for I know you have quite enough to do as it is. Thank you for you are already doing especially the suggestion for title/section change. Regards--[[User:Terence Kearey|Terence Kearey]] ([[User talk:Terence Kearey|talk]]) 16:58, 8 September 2010 (UTC)

Thank you for substituting scrumping by 'fair game' not quite as literal but definately literary. I am very intersted in the results of the feedback I found trying to maintain wikibooks editortials time consuming and not always possible. Still, I am trying!--[[User:Terence Kearey|Terence Kearey]] ([[User talk:Terence Kearey|talk]]) 10:19, 20 September 2010 (UTC)

Dear Adrignola, I have uploaded the final page to Suburban Hearth and Home. As you will have seen the final pages are about work as a lithographic artist. I did think about continuing the series [Hearth and Home] giving a picture of a lithographic artists life - environment, equipment, materials and skills. With that in mind I opened Wikipedia to see what was written there. I was not impressed. I considered editing but found there was too much needed. Should I fit something into the existing space on Wikipedia - number of words in the panels, and present it for submission or do a complete rewrite under a suitable title and let you decide... in that instance it would contain more words. As mentioned, I served my time, worked as a jouneyman, and lectured at The London College of Printing for ten years full-time - on the subject.--[[User:Terence Kearey|Terence Kearey]] ([[User talk:Terence Kearey|talk]]) 11:22, 23 September 2010 (UTC)

:There is less pressure on a writer at Wikibooks.  If you were to write at Wikipedia, references for everything you add would be essential and they won't accept any personal experience as sufficient to back up words you add.  Wikibooks is not such a stickler.  There is a {{tl|Wikibooks}} template at Wikpedia, so you would be able to link to a relevant page here from Wikipedia. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:05, 23 September 2010 (UTC)

Dear Adrignola, The recognition of prints is now complete and uploaded.

Dear Adrignola, Thank you. The Kensington Rifles now complete. I shall return to Lithographic Drawing. Are there any other outstanding corrections/edits to make. I am not sure quite about the state of The Collins of Chard. Perhaps this should be changed in keeping to wiki principles - to shy away from personal attachments.--[[User:Terence Kearey|Terence Kearey]] ([[User talk:Terence Kearey|talk]]) 14:04, 27 September 2010 (UTC)

== Chapter 8. Human sexual Evolution ==

Chapter 8
Human Sexual Evolution

Darwin’s theory proposed the principle of natural selection, sexual preferences that pass on chosen characteristics. This selective process takes account of social, biological, and cultural structures; analysing fitness, wellness, strength, adaptability, and mental agility. Survival of the fittest for humans is about babies where they are born, to whom, where and when.    
 
Anthropology - the study of man as an animal, deals with the historical measurement of mind and body – size, shape, motor skills and cognitive factors. Secular trends: refers to generational changes within a restricted land space, source population, culture and particular physical preferences, i.e. sports. 

Trends show man has grown taller, fatter and older on a varied diet including milk, warding off sickness and death by better general health care with a resistance to common infectious diseases. Couples are marrying later, the divorce rate is slowly creeping up for first and multiple marriages, the birth rate is dropping, and women have babies later to older men. The numbers of homosexuals ‘coming out’ has increased. It is a fact that every human bears a different genetic code making each unique. Children inherit characteristics which are carried on chromosomes that transmit genetic information (DNA).

Previous views of stereotypical men and women no longer remain true. Men are generally taller, heavier and stronger but die sooner although the gap is narrowing. Women are improving their sporting prowess taking a greater interest in all games previously the preserves of men. Most jobs, except when requiring greater strength are available and competed for by women, although heavy engineering still holds a preponderance of men.

Men are physically dominant suggests strength can dictate. There has been and continues to be a preponderance of men controlling and leading, business and the arts.  Women, bearing, protecting, and nurturing children, need security. Time and energy supporting children limits competitive activity. Competition stimulates competitiveness which drives forward new advances. Strong management techniques, limited unemployment, fear of being laid off, bonuses and good projections all contribute to push forward progress. 

Over the millennium human survival needed adaption – manipulation of the flora and fauna. Wandering tribes and animal herders stopped their seasonal migrations. Stability aided farmers growing cereals and rice to provide a staple diet. Populations have turned to factory production and industrialization. Competition between all societies pushes forward knowledge, experimentation and development. Generally profit has become the password to successful advancement.

The advancement in man’s growth, especially since the world wars pushed forward advancement of women’s rights and freedom’s, includes social, cultural and physical preferences. Education is likely to give a greater understanding of bodily functions and sexual preferences. However, with knowledge and evolutionary progress there remains ignorance about self induced and partner induced sexual activity. 

Children are interested in their bodies, they play and experiment. Penises become erect girls long for breasts and pubic hair. In teenage years play continues with greater sexual interest. Masturbation, a part hidden subject - discussed mainly amongst same sex groups, is practiced by the majority. It is believed early education stimulates sexual interest before responsible behaviour. Sexual bodily functions - the cognitive act, has been scientifically examined… however, conceptual, emotional and willingness are not so easily expressed. Social morality and personal embarrassment still restricts freedom even though books are read, lessons given and opinions questioned. 

Sexual intercourse has evolved by evolutionary processes stimulated by a natural instinct to procreate. Humans are joined by mutual attraction, conceptual agreement and opportunity - agreement for physical contact has become a social necessity. Procreation - love making, is usually initiated by words of endearment and affection. Human intercourse usually takes place lying down facing each other. It is the male which initiates having each function reflected. The actions, both before and after undressing, defined as foreplay, it is foreplay which stimulates and heightens the experience an act which uses both nature and design. 

This is a prelude to further mutual touching, eye contact, stroking and caressing especially by the male to breasts and vulva. Passionate kissing confirms mutual desire. The results are mutual arousal leading to penis erection, and vagina and uterine secretion. It is the female’s prerogative to either accept or reject penetration. This acceptance plus greater understanding of foreplay are the areas which have evolved. From penetration to ejaculation can take seconds whilst foreplay can last from minutes to hours.

== Chapter 8. Human sexual Evolution ==


{{Cultural Shifts in England/Chapter 8}}

Human Sexual Evolution

Darwin’s theory proposed the principle of natural selection, sexual preferences that pass on chosen characteristics. This selective process takes account of social, biological, and cultural structures; analysing fitness, wellness, strength, adaptability, and mental agility. Survival of the fittest for humans is about babies where they are born, to whom, where and when.    
 
Anthropology - the study of man as an animal, deals with the historical measurement of mind and body – size, shape, motor skills and cognitive factors. Secular trends: refers to generational changes within a restricted land space, source population, culture and particular physical preferences, i.e. sports. 

Trends show man has grown taller, fatter and older on a varied diet including milk, warding off sickness and death by better general health care with a resistance to common infectious diseases. Couples are marrying later, the divorce rate is slowly creeping up for first and multiple marriages, the birth rate is dropping, and women have babies later to older men. The numbers of homosexuals ‘coming out’ has increased. It is a fact that every human bears a different genetic code making each unique. Children inherit characteristics which are carried on chromosomes that transmit genetic information (DNA).

Previous views of stereotypical men and women no longer remain true. Men are generally taller, heavier and stronger but die sooner although the gap is narrowing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The sentence describing the lower gain exhibited when the collector and emitter are swapped have proved invaluable to me. It has saved me many hours trying to work out why my transistor was acting like a lower-gain transistor. Simply a case of two swapped leads. Thank you to all contributors for the superb article :)</text>

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

{{notice|This template is a legacy wrapper for {{tl|archives}}, which may have additional functionality over-and-above this template and generates the list of archives automatically by default.}}

This template can be used to display archives of a page in a floating box.

===Usage===
Include the archive box on the talk page by adding:

====Basic syntax====
&lt;pre&gt;{{Archive box | [[/Archive &lt;#&gt;]] }}&lt;/pre&gt;

====Full syntax====
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Archive box
 | archivelist = /archivelist
 | auto        = &lt;short|long|yes|no&gt;
 | index       = /Archive index
 | links       = &lt;#&gt;
 | search      = &lt;yes|no&gt;
 | collapsible = &lt;yes|no&gt;
 | collapsed   = &lt;yes|no&gt;
 | box-width   = &lt;#px or #em&gt;
 | root        = Wikipedia_talk:{{PAGENAME}}/Archive #}}
 | style       = &lt;CSS values&gt; 
 | title       = &lt;Alt. title&gt;
 | image       = [[File:Foo.png|35px]]  
 | bot         = &lt;name of bot&gt;     
 | age         = &lt;#&gt; (defaults to days) | 
 [[/Archive &lt;#&gt;]], [[/Archive &lt;#&gt;]], [[/Archive &lt;#&gt;]], etc.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Substitute &lt;code&gt;[[/Archive &lt;#&gt;]]&lt;/code&gt; with the actual name(s) of the archive page(s) and make sure to add the forward slash &lt;code&gt; / &lt;/code&gt;. How you present a list of archive pages is up to you. You can separate them with commas or format them as lists. You can also use piped links; see the [[#Automatic links]] and [[#Examples]] sections below.

===Parameters===
==== Placement ====
The box uses a style that makes it float to the right. In other words, it will be aligned to the right edge of the page and all content following it will flow around the box.

====Box width====
The box width can be set by using the &lt;code&gt;|box-width=&lt;/code&gt; parameter:
&lt;pre&gt;{{Archive box | box-width=13em | [[/Archive &lt;#&gt;]] }}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;{{Archive box | box-width=200px | [[/Archive &lt;#&gt;]] }}&lt;/pre&gt;

The standard width when this parameter is not used is 238px.

====Search====
A search bar which will search the archives of the current page can be added to the bottom of the box by using the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|search=yes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; parameter. Other parameters can adjust the search bar.
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|root=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; can be used to change the prefix of pages which are searched. The default is the current page name. ''Example: ''&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|root=User talk:Example/Archives&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;'' will search in pages starting with User talk:Example/Archives.''
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|search-width=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; can be used to change the width of the text field, in characters. The default is 22, which fits the search bar with the default box width. ''Note: unlike ''&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|box-width=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;'', this is a bare number with no units.''
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|search-break=yes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will insert a break between the search bar and search button. The default is ''no''.
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|button-label=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; can be used to change the text on the search button. The default is ''Search''.
&lt;pre&gt;{{Archive box | search=yes | [[/Archive &lt;#&gt;]] }}&lt;/pre&gt;

====Image====
The image can be changed from the default using the {{para|image=}} parameter. For example:
&lt;pre&gt;{{Archive box | image= [[Image:Crystal Clear app file-manager.png|35px]] | [[/Archive &lt;#&gt;]] }}&lt;/pre&gt;

=====Other icons=====
If you wish to use something other than the default icon, there's a gallery of available icons at [[commons:Category:Archive icons]].

====Style====
&lt;pre.raw&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Archive box | style= &lt;var&gt;CSS values&lt;/var&gt; | [[/Archive &lt;#&gt;]] &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Examples:
;Talk page colors on non-talk pages:&lt;code&gt;background-color:#F8EABA; border-color:#C0C090;&lt;/code&gt;
;Other page colors on talk pages:&lt;code&gt;background-color:#F9F9F9; border-color:#AAAAAA;&lt;/code&gt;
;Font size unchanged:&lt;code&gt;font-size:1em;&lt;/code&gt;
;Specific example, changing the background color to white : &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{archive box | auto=yes | style=background-color:#FFFFFF }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

====Automatic links====
If all the archives of a talk page are named ''exactly'' &lt;tt&gt;/Archive 1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;/Archive 2&lt;/tt&gt; etc. (it will ''not'' work with e.g. &lt;tt&gt;/Archive1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;/Archive 01&lt;/tt&gt;, or subpages of a subpage, e.g. &lt;tt&gt;/Archives/Archive 1&lt;/tt&gt;), you can use the &lt;tt&gt;auto&lt;/tt&gt; parameter to display links to them all automatically. The list will update itself when new archives are added. If there are also named archives, you can manually add links to those as well.

;Using &lt;code&gt;|auto=yes&lt;/code&gt;:
The links to the archive pages will appear as simple numbers, separated with commas (1, 2, 3, ...). '''Note:''' Archives numbered past 100 will be ignored.
&lt;pre&gt;{{archive box | auto=yes }}&lt;/pre&gt;

The optional ''root='', ''links='', and ''nobr='' parameters are passed to {{tl|archive list}} when '''auto=yes'''.  The following will look for a user's talk-page archives named ''/Archives/Archive 1'', ''/Archives/Archive 2'', etc., and list up to 5 archives per line:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{archive box
 |auto= yes
 |root= User_Talk:{{PAGENAME}}/Archive &lt;#&gt;
 |links= 5
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

;Using &lt;code&gt;|auto=long&lt;/code&gt;:
If there are no more than 36 archive pages, and you prefer a three-column output, use &lt;code&gt;|auto=long&lt;/code&gt;. The links to the archive pages will appear as Archive 1, Archive 2, etc. The links will be put into lines with a line break after each third link, to create columns. (Re-arranging the columns, e.g. from top to bottom, is ''not'' possible with this parameter. However, manually added links can be arranged in columns with {{tl|multicol}}. See the [[#multicol|multicol example]] below.)
&lt;pre&gt;{{archive box |auto=long }}&lt;/pre&gt;

The optional &lt;code&gt;|root=&lt;/code&gt; parameter is passed to {{tl|archive list}} when &lt;code&gt;|auto=long&lt;/code&gt;. The following will look for a user's talk-page archives named ''/Archives/Archive 1'', ''/Archives/Archive 2'', etc.
&lt;pre&gt;
{{archive box
 |auto= long
 |root= User_Talk:{{PAGENAME}}/Archive &lt;#&gt;
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
{{intricate}}
{{tmbox|image=[[File:Symbol opinion vote.svg|40px]]|type=content|text=This template is called by [[Template:Archive box]]. Please ensure that any changes do not break the legacy functionality of archive box.}}

The {{tl|archives}} template may be used to add a box containing page links to archived discussions. It will automatically detect archived pages by default if they are named appropriately, eliminating the need to manually update the box each time a new archive page is created.

=== Usage ===
&lt;pre&gt;
{{archives
 |archivelist= /archivelist
 |auto=        &lt;short|long|no&gt;
 |index=       /Archive index
 |search=      &lt;yes|no&gt;
 |list=        
 |collapsible= &lt;yes|no&gt;
 |collapsed=   &lt;yes|no&gt;
 |style=       
 |title=       
 |image=       
 |alt=         
 |link=        
 |bot=         
 |age=         
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Parameters===
; archivelist: Specifies a link to a subpage, such as &quot;/archivelist&quot; that contains the archive list. See the &quot;Archive list&quot; and &quot;Additional notes&quot; sections below for further important details.
; auto= &lt;short|long|no&gt;: Specifies the format of the auto-generated archive list. If left unspecified, the default is &quot;long&quot;; any other word (except &quot;no&quot;) will result in &quot;short&quot; and &quot;no&quot; disables auto-detection.
; index: Adds an &quot;Index&quot; link in the title to a specified subpage, such as &quot;/Archive index&quot; that should be the subject index page for all archived discussions.
; list: Inline list of archives. This is not needed if the pages are named &quot;Archive 1&quot;, &quot;Archive 2&quot; and so on, in which case automatic archiving works, but can be used in addition to automatic archiving if additional pages with other names are available.
; collapsible : If ''yes'', makes the list collapsible.
; collapsed : If ''yes'', makes the list collapsed.
; style : An arbitrary string of CSS can be applied to the box (use with care).
; title : An alternate title, defaults to a bolded &quot;Archives&quot;.
; image : An alternate image to be used, defaults to &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Replacement filing cabinet.svg&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.
; link : Link for the image. This normally defaults to empty, which means no link. However, if &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; is nonempty, it defaults to the image's file page.
; alt : Alt text for the image, for visually impaired readers. This defaults to empty. If a nonempty value is specified for &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; should be nonempty too, and should indicate what will happen if the user clicks on the image.

==== Search ====
; search: If ''yes'', adds a search box to the template. 
; root: Specify a different base than &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;FULLPAGENAME}}/&lt;/code&gt;.  Use '''prefix''' if the additional of a trailing slash is not desired.
;search-break: ''Default'':no
;search-width: ''Default'':22
; searchbuttonlabel: ''Default'': Search

==== Bot archive notice ====
; bot : If specified, a note about automatic archiving will be shown.
; age : If specified, the archiving delay will be provided.

=== Archive list ===
By default (with no explicit parameters), the archive list presented in the box is determined automatically. If a subpage called &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;/archivelist&lt;/code&gt;&quot; exists, it will be used as the central content of the box. 

If no archivelist subpage is detected, numbered archive subpages will be listed in long format. Such pages must be named as &quot;/Archive #&quot; because other naming styles will not be detected. If no subpages are found, the archivebox will contain only the &quot;About&quot; and &quot;Edit&quot; links, with the Edit link targeted at &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;/archivelist&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, which can then be used to begin manually populating the list, if desired.

If the &quot;&lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt;&quot; parameter is specified, the &quot;Edit&quot; link is removed. The &quot;&lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;&quot; auto format (the default) indicates &quot;Archive 1&quot;, &quot;Archive 2&quot;, and so on. The &quot;&lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;&quot; auto format indicates only the archive number. See more examples below.

If an archive list is specified, the name of the subpage is changed; otherwise, the behavior is the same.

An archive list can also be passed in the first unnamed parameter avoiding the need for a subpage.

Using &quot;auto=no&quot; will disable archive auto-detection. Manually specified archives will still be shown.

=== Additional notes ===
The &quot;&lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;archivelist&lt;/code&gt;&quot; parameters are not intended to be used together. (Doing so removes the edit link, but will still use the specified archive list page if it exists.)

The auto-generated archive list requires subpages to use the common naming convention. That is, &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;/Archive 1&quot;, &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;/Archive 2&quot;, and so on. The letter &quot;A&quot; must be capitalized, there must be a single space between the word &quot;Archive&quot; and the number, and there must be no leading zeros. If archive subpages do not conform to this convention, they can be [[Help:Pages#Moving|renamed]] to conform, or a manual list can be maintained.

Specifying &quot;&lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt;&quot; with any right-hand-side value other than &quot;&lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;code&gt;no&lt;/code&gt;&quot; results in the short-format list; the use of &quot;&lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;&quot; as the value just makes things more obvious to others.

The short and long auto lists are generated by {{tl|archive list}} and {{tl|archive list long}}, respectively. They are limited to a maximum of 100 and 36 subpages, respectively. Beyond those limits, additional subpages will not be listed. In such cases, a manually generated archive list subpage would need to be created and maintained.

=== Examples ===
; Default

 &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{archives}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
{{archives}}
{{clear}}

; Short, index

 &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;archives
  |auto= short
  |index= /Archive index
 &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

{{archives
|auto=short
|index=/Archive index
}}
{{clear}}

This template can be used as a wrapper to simplify the inclusion of an image in a template, where users may use several different forms of syntax.

It is primarily of use in templates and should '''not''' be used in pages directly.

=== Usage ===

* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Image | Example.svg | 20px}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; → {{Image | Example.svg | 20px}}
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Image | File:Example.svg | 20px}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; → {{Image | File:Example.svg | 20px}}
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Image | :File:Example.svg | 20px}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; → {{Image | :File:Example.svg | 20px}}
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Image | [[File:Example.svg|30px]] | 20px}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; → {{Image | [[File:Example.svg|30px]] | 20px}}

Note that additional parameters are (deliberately) ignored if full image syntax is passed in the first parameter. You can pass up to five parameters directly otherwise:
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Image | Example.svg | 20px | thumb | none | Foo}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; → {{Image | Example.svg | 20px | thumb | none | Foo}}

You can also pass arbitrary parameters accepted by the image syntax if you separate them with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{!}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. You may need to number them explicitly if they contain an equals sign &quot;=&quot;:
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Image | Example.svg | 2= 20px{{!}}link=Main Page}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; → {{Image | Example.svg | 2= 20px{{!}}link=Main Page}}

__NOTOC__
This is the {{tl|nowraplinks}} template.

This template prevents word wraps (line breaks) inside links (links with spaces in) and only allows word wraps between the links and in normal text. This is useful for instance for long link lists. It works similarly to {{tl|nowrap}}.

This template takes no parameters by default, instead it works in pair with {{tl|nowraplinks end}}. It can also optionally be used with a parameter.

==== Usage ====

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{nowraplinks}}

[[This link will not wrap]] - [[This link also won't wrap]] -
[[And so on]] - But this sentence might word wrap.

{{nowraplinks end}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{nowraplinks | [[This link will not wrap]] - [[This link also won't wrap]] -
[[And so on]] - But this sentence might word wrap. }}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Both examples will render something like this:

:[[Template:Nowraplinks end|This link will not wrap]] - &lt;br&gt;
:[[Template:Nowraplinks end|This link also won't wrap]] - &lt;br&gt;
:[[Template:Nowraplinks end|And so on]] - But this sentence &lt;br&gt;
:might word wrap.

But they will ''not'' render like this:

:[[Template:Nowraplinks end|This link will not wrap]] - [[Template:Nowraplinks end|This link]]&lt;br&gt;
:[[Template:Nowraplinks end|shouldn't have wrapped]] - [[Template:Nowraplinks end|And so on]] -&lt;br&gt;
:But this sentence might word wrap.

=== Advanced usage ===

Most of the functionality in this template is implemented as a CSS class in [[MediaWiki:Common.css|common.css]]. That class can be used together with pretty much any HTML tag or any box to prevent links to word wrap. For instance like this:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;nowraplinks&quot;&gt; Lots of text and links &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
Or like this:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nowraplinks&quot;&gt; Lots of text and links &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

If the nowraplinks class is applied in the header of a table it will prevent line wrapping of links in ''all'' cells in the table. Note that in a table header there usually is a need to apply several classes. Then the class names should be separated by spaces in the class tag, not by commas or semicolons. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable nowraplinks&quot;
|
[[This link will not wrap]]{{·}} 
[[This link also won't wrap]]{{·}} 
[[And so on]]{{·}} 
But this sentence might word wrap.
|
[[This link will not wrap]]{{·}} 
[[This link also won't wrap]]{{·}} 
[[And so on]]{{·}} 
But this sentence might word wrap.
|}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

It will render this:

{| class=&quot;wikitable nowraplinks&quot;
|-
|
[[Template:Nowraplinks end|This link will not wrap]]{{·}} 
[[Template:Nowraplinks end|This link also won't wrap]]{{·}} 
[[Template:Nowraplinks end|And so on]]{{·}} 
But this sentence might word wrap.
|
[[Template:Nowraplinks end|This link will not wrap]]{{·}} 
[[Template:Nowraplinks end|This link also won't wrap]]{{·}} 
[[Template:Nowraplinks end|And so on]]{{·}} 
But this sentence might word wrap.
|}

To really see the nowrap effect on the links above you can drag the width of your web browser window so it becomes smaller and smaller.

=== Technical details ===

The actual code that does the job is this [[CSS]] code in [[MediaWiki:Common.css|Common.css]]. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
.nowraplinks a,
.nowraplinks .selflink { 
  white-space: nowrap;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

It simply means that any white-space inside links (HTML A tags) and bold &quot;links&quot; to the page itself are not allowed to wrap.

It is then invoked like this:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nowraplinks&quot;&gt; Lots of text and links &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

That span code is what the {{tl|nowraplinks}} and {{tl|nowraplinks end}} tags are packaging in an easy to use way.

The [[Template:Navbox|standard navboxes]] use the .nowraplinks class, thus automatically handling most wrapping problems in those navboxes.

* {{tl|nowrap}} - A template with similar purpose.
* {{tl|·}} and {{tl|•}} - If you need dots/bullets for your link lists.

This template can be used to create proper category titles, both if the name space was omitted or supplied by the user.

It is primarily of use in templates and should '''not''' be used in pages directly.

=== Usage ===

* &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Category title| Food  }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; → &quot;&lt;code&gt;{{Category title| Food }}&lt;/code&gt;&quot;
* &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Category title| Category:Food }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; → &quot;&lt;code&gt;{{Category title| Category:Food }}&lt;/code&gt;&quot;
* &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Category title| :Category:Food }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; → &quot;&lt;code&gt;{{Category title| :Category:Food }}&lt;/code&gt;&quot;

This template can be used to simplify the inclusion of links in templates where users may use several different forms of syntax. It accepts a parameter and returns it linked, unless it already is. Works both with wikilinks and with HTTP links.

It is primarily of use in templates and should '''not''' be used in pages directly.

=== Usage ===
; Wiki links
*{{tlx|linked|Main Page}}                                            → {{linked|Main Page}}
*{{tlx|linked|Main Page|Wikijunior}}                                        → {{linked|Main Page|Wikijunior}}
*{{tlx|linked|&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Main Page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|Wikijunior}}                   → {{linked|[[Main Page]]|Wikijunior}}
*{{tlx|linked|:Main Page}}                                           → {{linked|:Main Page}}
*{{tlx|linked|File:Example.jpg}}                               → {{linked|File:Example.jpg}}
*{{tlx|linked|:File:Example.jpg}}                              → {{linked|:File:Example.jpg}}
*{{tlx|linked|Category:Categories}}                                  → {{linked|Category:Categories}}
*{{tlx|linked|:Category:Categories}}                                 → {{linked|:Category:Categories}}

;HTTP links
*{{tlx|linked|&lt;nowiki&gt; http://example.org&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}           → {{linked| http://example.org}}        
*{{tlx|linked|&lt;nowiki&gt; http://example.org&lt;/nowiki&gt;|Bar}}       → {{linked|http://example.org|Bar}}        
*{{tlx|linked|&lt;nowiki&gt; [http://example.org Foo]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|Bar}} → {{linked|[http://example.org Foo]|Bar}} 

;HTTP links
*{{tlx|linked|&lt;nowiki&gt;https://example.org&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}           → {{linked|https://example.org}}       
*{{tlx|linked|&lt;nowiki&gt;https://example.org&lt;/nowiki&gt;|Bar}}       → {{linked|https://example.org|Bar}}       
*{{tlx|linked|&lt;nowiki&gt;[https://example.org Foo]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|Bar}} → {{linked|[https://example.org Foo]|Bar}}

      <comment>clarify ambiguity, add obvious example of trimming leading whitespace</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Documentation subpage}}
&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===

: &lt;code&gt;{{Tlx|Str left|&lt;string&gt;|&lt;count&gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;

Gives the resultant &lt;count&gt; of characters creating a substring of characters from the start of the [[w:Trim (programming)|trimmed]] string (i.e. the substring returned will have length &lt;count&gt;, exclusive of leading whitespace characters, which are trimmed first before &lt;count&gt; is invoked).

If &lt;count&gt; is invalid or empty, an empty string is returned. If undefined, it defaults to 1.

=== Limitations ===
* Length to 500: The maximum substring stops at 500 long, yet gives no error message. Only 500 characters can be extracted even if the &lt;string&gt; is longer.
* Inexpensive (uses no other templates).

=== Examples ===

*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Str left| Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 10 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;rarr; {{Str left| Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 10 }}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Str left| &amp;nbsp; Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 4 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;rarr; {{Str left|    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 4 }}, (note leading spaces trimmed!)
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Str left| Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 1 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;rarr; {{Str left| Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 1 }}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Str left| Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 0 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;rarr; {{Str left| Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 0 }}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Str left| Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;rarr; {{Str left| Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | }}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Str left| Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;rarr; {{Str left| Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet }}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Str left| Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 40 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;rarr; {{Str left| Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 40 }}

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''reinterpret_cast''' keyword is used to simply cast one type bitwise to another. Any pointer or integral type can be cast to any other with reinterpret cast, easily allowing for misuse. For instance, with reinterpret cast one might, unsafely, cast an integer pointer to a string pointer. It should be used to cast between incompatible pointer types.

;Syntax:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
    TYPE reinterpret_cast&lt;TYPE&gt; (object);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;reinterpret_cast&lt;&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; is used for all non portable casting operations. This makes it simpler to find these non portable casts when porting an application from one OS to another.

The &lt;code&gt;reinterpret_cast&lt;T&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; will change the type of an expression without altering its underlying bit pattern. This is useful to cast pointers of a particular type into a &lt;code&gt;void*&lt;/code&gt; and subsequently back to the original type.
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int a = 0xffe38024;
int* b = reinterpret_cast&lt;int*&gt;(a);
&lt;/source&gt;

This is the {{tl|px}} meta-template.

It helps other templates, such as infoboxes, to take image size parameters in both of the forms &quot;40&quot; or &quot;40px&quot;. It takes up to three parameters and returns the first one that has any content. That is, the first one that is defined (not null) and not empty. Thus a default value for the width of the image can be fed as the second or third parameter.

=== Usage ===
Here is what this template does. Code to the left, actual rendering to the right:

:{{tlx|px|40}} = {{px|40}}
:{{tlx|px|40px}} = {{px|40px}}

And with an optional second or even third parameter to be used as a default value if the first or second parameter is empty or undefined:

:{{tlx|px||50}} = {{px||50}}
:{{tlx|px||50px}} = {{px||50px}}

:{{tlx|px|||60}} = {{px|||60}}
:{{tlx|px|||60px}} = {{px|||60px}}

And here is how it can be used inside another template:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:{{{image}}} | {{px|{{{size|}}}}} | {{{caption|}}} ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:{{{image}}} | {{px|{{{size|}}}|250}} | {{{caption|}}} ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:{{{image}}} | {{px| {{{size|}}} | {{{width|}}} | 250 }} | {{{caption|}}} ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

'''Note!''' The parameters to {{tl|px}} must use the pipe &quot;|&quot;, like this: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{width|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Or else {{tl|px}} will be fed and return the string &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{width}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; if '''width''' was not defined.

=== Background ===
It used to be a bit tricky to handle empty but defined image size values in a template, since the MediaWiki pipetrick doesn't return the default value for empty parameters. That is, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{width|250px}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not return &quot;250px&quot; if the template was called like this: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{template|width=}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

The usual workaround was to do like this: 
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#if:{{{width|}}}|{{{width}}}|250px}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

When at the same time handling the &quot;pxpx&quot; bug this became even more messy code:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:{{{image}}} | {{#if:{{{width|}}}|{{px|{{{width}}}}}|250px}} ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

To simplify the coding, {{tl|px}} now allows for an optional default value to be defined allowing for the following:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:{{{image}}} | {{px|{{{width|}}}|250}} ]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Alternative approach ===

Instead of letting your template take say the parameters '''image''' and '''size''', you can build your template so it takes an image with full wiki notation. Like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{your template
| image = [[File:Example.png|40px]]
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This approach is used with many templates, for instance the {{tl|ambox}} and {{tl|tmbox}}. This gives the users much more freedom in what they feed as the image parameter, and even allows such things as feeding two images at the same time. And it makes your template code much simpler.

=== Test examples ===

* {{tlx|px|40}} = {{px|40}}
* {{tlx|px|40px}} = {{px|40px}}
* {{tlx|px|40pxpx}} = {{px|40pxpx}}
* {{tlx|px|junk}} = {{px|junk}}
* {{tlx|px}} = {{px}}
* {{tlx|px|}} = {{px|}}
* {{tlx|px||}} = {{px||}}
* {{tlx|px|||}} = {{px|||}}
* {{tlx|px|40|50}} = {{px|40|50}}
* {{tlx|px||50}} = {{px||50}}
* {{tlx|px||50px}} = {{px||50px}}
* {{tlx|px||50|60}} = {{px||50|60}}
* {{tlx|px|||60}} = {{px|||60}}
* {{tlx|px|||60px}} = {{px|||60px}}
* {{tlx|px|frameless}} = {{px|frameless}}
* {{tlx|px||frameless}} = {{px||frameless}}
* {{tlx|px|40|frameless}} = {{px|40|frameless}}
* {{tlx|px|frameless|40px}} = {{px|frameless|40px}}

This is the {{tl|str len}} meta-template.

It takes a string as parameter and returns its length (excluding those at the start and end). It can count up to 500 in length, and returns 500 for strings that are too long.

'''Note!''' For most usage cases it is much easier and costs much less server resources to use {{tl|str ≥ len}} or one of its sister templates. See the [[#See also|see also]] section below.

=== Examples ===

If the parameter is empty or undefined it is considered to be of zero length: 

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{str len}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns {{str len}}
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{str len|}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns {{str len|}}
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{str len| }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns {{str len| }}

It counts the length correctly, even if the string contains spaces, looks like a number, or contains special characters:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{str len| ab cde }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns {{str len| ab cde }}

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{str len| 1234567 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns {{str len| 1234567 }}

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{str len| café åäö }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns {{str len| café åäö }}

It can measure strings up to 500 in length, and returns 500 for strings that are too long:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{str len| 499-characters... }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns {{str len| abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi }}
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{str len| 1000-characters... }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns {{str len| abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghij }}

=== Technical details ===
MediaWiki has no parser function or magic word to measure string lengths. And measuring string length using template code is very heavy on the servers. Thus this template is as optimized as possible. But you should consider using {{tl|str ≥ len}} instead, since for most usage cases it is much easier to use and it costs much less server resources.

This template calls {{tl|str len/core}} which does most of the work. For documentation on the internal workings of these two templates see /core.

This is the {{tl|str len/core}} sub-template.

Do not use this template directly, use {{tl|str len}} instead.

This template is called from {{tl|str len}}, see user documentation there.

The rest of the sections here are only for those that want to understand the internal workings of this template.

=== Technical details ===

MediaWiki has no parser function or magic word to measure string lengths. And measuring string length using template code is very heavy on the servers. Thus this template is as optimized as possible.

Based on code for determining whether the length of a string is greater than a given value, the template searches for the actual string length. This sub-template holds most of the search function for {{tl|str len}}. This sub-template can search from 000 to 499. The reason for the length limitation is that the magic word &lt;nowiki&gt;{{padleft:|}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; only can pad up to 500 characters.

The basic comparison function used here is this:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{#ifeq: xABCD | x{{padleft:ABCD| 9 }}
| Equal or longer.
| Shorter.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which means: &quot;''Is the string ABCD &gt;= 9 characters long?''&quot;

Switch-cases and ifeq are too smart, they understand numbers. So they think that &quot;0&quot; and &quot;00&quot; are equal. That is why this code adds an &quot;x&quot; in front of the parameters, to make them into strings like &quot;x0123&quot; so the string comparisons work properly. 

==== About ((str len)) ====

Some of these operations are white space sensitive, so we must strip away any white space around the string parameter. That's why the string parameter is surrounded by &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#if:x| {{{1|}}} }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in some places.

{{tl|str len}} first checks if the string is 500 characters or longer, since the search function in /core would otherwise return 499 for any string of 500 characters or more. (The older version of /core returned 999.) This also means that checking the really long strings is fairly efficient, it only takes one padleft operation and no parsing of the /core sub-template.

The three calls to /core is actually a loop, or recursion if you will.

The parameters to /core are white space sensitive. That is why we indent the parameters to /core so strangely. See more about this in the next section. If you change any of the indentation in {{tl|str len}} you are likely to break this template. We could of course add a lot of white space stripping in /core, but that would cause hideous code in /core and would be very inefficient.

==== About ((str len/core)) ====

Note: The x's used in the explanation from here on just mean &quot;any value from 0 to 9&quot;.

This template first searches 0xx to 4xx and then returns 0 to 4, as in 000 to 400. Then it searches x0x to x9x and returns x0 to x9, as in x00 to x90. Then it searches xx0 to xx9 and returns xx0 to xx9. 

This template takes three unnamed (numbered) parameters:

1: The string that we want to know the length of.

2: The number returned by the previous rounds of searching. Thus at first search this parameter should be empty, at second search this parameter should hold a value between 0 and 4, and at third search it should hold a value between 00 and 49. 

3: A string with the number of zeros to pad behind 0-9 when doing the search. (The current version of this code doesn't actually pad the zeros behind 0-9, but instead uses it to choose which search function to use.) Thus at first search this parameter should be &quot;00&quot; so it can search 000 to 400. At second search it should be &quot;0&quot;, so it can search x00 to x90. And at third search the string should be empty, so it can search xx0 to xx9.

The parameters to this template are white space sensitive: Parameters 1 and 3 must not have any white space before them. And parameter 2 must not have any white space after it.

This code is heavily optimized in many ways. If we only go after what the NewPP limit reports tell, then it might seem we could optimize further by splitting this /core template up into three different /core templates, one for each search round. Since then we don't need the switch-case, and that gives lower values in the NewPP limit reports. However we know it is very costly for the Wikibooks servers to fetch more sub-templates, so we are pretty sure that would be much more costly.

==== Search trees used ====
The search trees used in the loops are optimized based on the assumption that shorter strings are much more common. Note that finding 0 requires to do the &quot;string &gt;= 1&quot; comparison, thus takes at least one operation. And finding for instance 1 means also checking the &quot;string &gt;= 2&quot; comparison, thus takes at least two operations.

The numbers shown in the trees below are not the value searched for, but the value compared with. Thus &lt;code&gt;--4--&lt;/code&gt; means the comparison &quot;string &gt;= 4&quot;.

0xx-4xx, using linear search since most strings will probably be less than 100 bytes:

&lt;pre&gt;
1--2--3--4

0 1 2 3 4 = Values to find.
1+2+3+4+4 = 14 comparisons to find all values once.
&lt;/pre&gt;

x0x-x9x, using linear search for 0x-3x, binary search for 4x-9x, 
since most strings will probably be less than 40 bytes:

&lt;pre&gt;
1--2--3--4--6--8--9
            |  |
            5  7

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 = Values to find.
1+2+3+4+6+6+7+7+7+7 = 50 comparisons to find all values once.
&lt;/pre&gt;

xx0-xx9, using binary search:

&lt;pre&gt;
4-----6--8--9
|     |  |
2--3  5  7
|
1

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 = Values to find.
3+3+3+3+3+3+4+4+4+4 = 34 comparisons to find all values once.
&lt;/pre&gt;

For comparison, here is the data for a full linear search:

&lt;pre&gt;
1--2--3--4--5--6--7--8--9

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 = Values to find.
1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+9 = 54 comparisons to find all values once.
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is the {{tl|str ≠ len}} meta-template.

It helps other templates check if a string is &quot;not equal&quot; vs. &quot;equal&quot; to a given length.

'''Note!''' For most usage cases it might be better to use {{tl|str ≥ len}}. (See the [[#See also|see also]] section below.) 

=== Usage ===

This template takes 3 to 4 unnamed parameters.

Here is how to check if the string &quot;abcde&quot; is exactly 5 characters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{str ≠ len | abcde | 5
| Not equal.
| Equal.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which returns this:

:{{str ≠ len | abcde | 5
| Not equal.
| Equal.
}}

Templates have a problem to handle parameter data that contains equal signs &quot;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. But that is easily solved by using numbered parameters. Here we check if the string &quot;ab=cde&quot; is exactly 100 characters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{str ≠ len 
| 1 = ab=cde 
| 2 = 100
| 3 = Not equal, &quot;!=&quot;.
| 4 = Equal, &quot;=&quot;.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which returns this:

:{{str ≠ len 
| 1 = ab=cde 
| 2 = 100
| 3 = Not equal, &quot;!=&quot;.
| 4 = Equal, &quot;=&quot;.
}}

It probably is a good habit to always use the numbered parameters, since you might not know beforehand exactly how the data will look that your template will feed to this meta-template.

=== Parameters ===

Detailed parameter explanation:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{str ≠ len 
| 1 = A string, 0-500 characters long.
| 2 = 0 - 500
| 3 = Data to return/render when &quot;not equally long&quot;.
| 4 = Data to return/render when &quot;equally long&quot;.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Empty or undefined strings are considered to be of 0 length. Strings longer than 500 are not truncated to 500.

Length values below 0 are considered to be 0. Length values above 500 are considered to be 500.

Thus a string longer than 500 is always considered to be &quot;not equally long&quot;, even if it is compared with the &quot;correct&quot; length value.

=== Technical details ===

This template would be equivalent to templates named &lt;nowiki&gt;{{str != len}} or {{str == len}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but we can't use those template names since they don't work well in MediaWiki.

Even though this is a string handling template it uses efficient code. (While some of the other string handling templates are probably so heavy on the servers that we perhaps should not use them.)

[[Help:Template|Templates]] have problems to handle parameter data that contains pipes &quot;&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, unless the pipe is inside another template &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{name|param1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or inside a piped link &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Help:Template|help]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Thus templates can not handle [[Help:Table|wikitables]] as input unless you escape them by using the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{!}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; magic word. This makes it hard to use wikitables as parameters to templates. Instead the usual solution is to use &quot;HTML wikimarkup&quot; for the table code, which is more robust.

This is the {{tl|str ≤ ≥ len}} meta-template.

It helps other templates check if a string is &quot;shorter&quot; vs. &quot;equally long&quot; vs. &quot;longer&quot; than a given length.

'''Note!''' For most usage cases it might be better to use {{tl|str ≥ len}}. (See the [[#See also|see also]] section below.) 

=== Usage ===

This template takes 3 to 5 unnamed parameters.

Here is how to check if the string &quot;abcde&quot; is 4 characters long:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{str ≤ ≥ len | abcde | 4
| Shorter.
| Equal.
| Longer.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which returns this:

:{{str ≤ ≥ len | abcde | 4
| Shorter.
| Equal.
| Longer.
}}

Templates have a problem to handle parameter data that contains equal signs &quot;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. But that is easily solved by using numbered parameters. Here we check if the string &quot;ab=cde&quot; is 100 characters long:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{str ≤ ≥ len
| 1 = ab=cde
| 2 = 100
| 3 = Shorter, not &quot;=&quot;.
| 4 = Equal &quot;=&quot;.
| 5 = Longer, not &quot;=&quot;.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which returns this:

:{{str ≤ ≥ len
| 1 = ab=cde 
| 2 = 100
| 3 = Shorter, not &quot;=&quot;.
| 4 = Equal &quot;=&quot;.
| 5 = Longer, not &quot;=&quot;.
}}

It probably is a good habit to always use the numbered parameters, since you might not know beforehand exactly how the data will look that your template will feed to this meta-template.

=== Parameters ===

Detailed parameter explanation:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{str ≤ ≥ len
| 1 = A string, 0-500 characters long.
| 2 = 0 - 500
| 3 = Data to return/render when &quot;shorter than&quot;.
| 4 = Data to return/render when &quot;equally long&quot;.
| 5 = Data to return/render when &quot;longer than&quot;.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Empty or undefined strings are considered to be of 0 length. Strings longer than 500 are not truncated to 500.

Length values below 0 are considered to be 0. Length values above 500 are considered to be 500.

Thus a string longer than 500 is always considered to be &quot;longer&quot;, even if it is compared with the &quot;correct&quot; length value.

=== Technical details ===

Potential alternative templates names would be &lt;nowiki&gt;{{str &lt;=&gt; len}}, {{str &gt;=&lt; len}} or {{str ≥ ≤ len}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but we can't use the first two of those template names since they don't work in MediaWiki.

Even though this is a string handling template it uses efficient code. (While some of the other string handling templates are probably so heavy on the servers that we perhaps should not use them.)

[[Help:Template|Templates]] have problems to handle parameter data that contains pipes &quot;&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, unless the pipe is inside another template &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{name|param1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or inside a piped link &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Help:Template|help]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Thus templates can not handle [[Help:Table|wikitables]] as input unless you escape them by using the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{!}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; magic word. This makes it hard to use wikitables as parameters to templates. Instead the usual solution is to use &quot;HTML wikimarkup&quot; for the table code, which is more robust.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===

: &lt;code&gt;{{Tlx|Str right|&lt;string&gt;|&lt;offset&gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;

Gives the characters from &lt;offset&gt; to the end of the string.

If &lt;count&gt; is invalid, empty or undefined, this template goes berserk, so don't do that.

=== Limitations === 
* Up to 100 characters in the input string. If possible, first check length of input string using {{Tl|Str len|&lt;string&gt;}}. Using strings longer than 100 characters may result in the error '''''&quot;&lt;font color=#CC1100&gt;max index is 100 for str sub long&lt;/font&gt;&quot;'''''.
* Limited set of characters.
* Expensive.

=== Examples ===
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Str right| lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 10 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;rarr; {{Str right| lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 10 }}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Str right| lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 1 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;rarr; {{Str right| lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 1 }}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Str right| lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 0 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;rarr; {{Str right| lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 0 }}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Str right |123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.1 | 99}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;rarr; {{Str right |nocategory=true |123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.1 | 99}}

=== Usage ===

&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{str sub long|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''text''|''start''|''length''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = Substring of ''text'' starting at ''start'' and containing ''length'' characters. Base 0: the first character is numbered 0, and so on, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{str sub long|20090624130510|8|2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns the 2 characters starting at the 9th, i.e. &quot;{{str_sub|20090624130510|8|2}}&quot;

''start'' + ''length'' must be less than 100.  Only operates on a limited character set.

=== Usage ===
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{str_sub|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''text''|''start''|''length''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; = Substring of ''text'' starting at ''start'' and containing ''length'' characters. Base 0: the first character is numbered 0, and so on, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{str_sub|20090624130510|8|2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns the 2 characters starting at the 9th, i.e. &quot;{{str_sub|20090624130510|8|2}}&quot;

''start'' + ''length'' must be less than 50.  Only operates on a limited character set.

The '''Template:str_index_any''' extracts a specified nth character from a string, even allowing for accented letters to be included in the string.

=== Usage ===
:: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''str index any'''|''text''|''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; = Returns the ''n''-th character of ''text''.

Supports a larger character set, allowing the text to have accented letters.  Returns an error message for unknown characters. Returns &amp;amp;#32; for a blank space.

=== Examples ===
* {{tlx| {{BASEPAGENAME}} |0123456789ABCDEF|15}} → {{ {{BASEPAGENAME}} |0123456789ABCDEF|15}}
* {{tlx| {{BASEPAGENAME}} |ÁBĆĎÉf-ABCDEF|4}} → {{ {{BASEPAGENAME}} |ÁBĆĎÉf-ABCDEF|4}}
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt; Str len |{{ {{BASEPAGENAME}} |a b|1&lt;nowiki&gt;}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; → {{ Str len |{{ {{BASEPAGENAME}} |a b|1}}}}
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt; Str len |{{ {{BASEPAGENAME}} |a b|2&lt;nowiki&gt;}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; → {{ Str len |{{ {{BASEPAGENAME}} |a b|2}}}}
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt; Str len |{{ {{BASEPAGENAME}} |a b|3&lt;nowiki&gt;}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; → {{ Str len |{{ {{BASEPAGENAME}} |a b|3}}}}

The last example shows extraction of letter &quot;b&quot; with string length as 1. The prior example extracts a blank but considers the length as 5 for the 5 characters &quot;&amp;amp;#32;&quot; even though there is only 1 space, and hence, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{str len|&amp;amp;#32;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; &amp;rarr; {{str len|&amp;#32;}}. If surrounded by 2 other characters, then the length might be totalled incorrectly as 7 (rather than 3 characters):

* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt; Str len |&lt;{{ {{BASEPAGENAME}} |a b|2&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; → {{ Str len |&lt;{{ {{BASEPAGENAME}} |a b|2}}&gt;}}
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt; Str len |X{{ {{BASEPAGENAME}} |a b|2&lt;nowiki&gt;}}X}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; → {{ Str len |X{{ {{BASEPAGENAME}} |a b|2}}X}}
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt; Str len |X{{ Str index |a b|2&lt;nowiki&gt;}}X}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; → {{ Str len |X{{ Str index |a b|2}}X}}
* &lt;nowiki&gt;X{{&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{BASEPAGENAME}} |a b|2&lt;nowiki&gt;}}X&lt;/nowiki&gt; → X{{ {{BASEPAGENAME}} |a b|2}}X

The same string-length problem occurs when using template {{tl| Str index }}. There might be other quirks as well, but most cases work as expected.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===

: &lt;code&gt;{{Tlx|Str rightc|&lt;string&gt;|&lt;count&gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;{{Tlx|Str rightc|&lt;string&gt;|&lt;count&gt;|&lt;result if empty&gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;

Gives a substring of length &lt;count&gt; of characters from the right-side end of the string. If the parameter 1 &lt;string&gt; is empty, then immediately returns with parameter 3 (or nothing), and skips all the complex processing usually needed to extract a substring.

If &lt;count&gt; is invalid, empty or undefined, this template goes berserk, so don't do that.
 
=== Limitations === 
* Up to 100 characters in the input string. If possible, first check length of input string using {{Tl|Str len|&lt;string&gt;}}. Using strings longer than 100 characters may result in the error '''''&quot;&lt;font color=#CC1100&gt;max index is 100 for str sub long&lt;/font&gt;&quot;'''''.
* Limited set of characters.
* Expensive (if used too many times per page, generates &quot;Wikimedia Foundation Server Error&quot;).
* Returning parameter 3, when parameter 1 is empty, was added 8 May 2010.

=== Examples ===

*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Str rightc| lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 10 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;rarr; {{Str rightc| lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 10 }}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Str rightc| lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 1 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;rarr; {{Str rightc| lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 1 }}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Str rightc| lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 0 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;rarr; {{Str rightc| lorem ipsum dolor sit amet | 0 }}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Str rightc| | 1 | empty }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;rarr; {{Str rightc| | 1 |empty }}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Str rightc |123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.1 | 99}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;rarr; {{Str rightc |nocategory=true |123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.123456789.1 | 99}}

==Usage==
This template can be applied to any talk page or discussion archive, and will return links to all the numbered archives of that page or its parent page. In order for the template to work, the archives must follow the naming convention of &lt;tt&gt;Talk:PAGENAME/Archive 1&lt;/tt&gt;, with a capital A, a space before the number, and no leading zeros. This template should not be substituted – that way, the list of links will update itself whenever a new numbered archive is added. This template can be used with {{tl|archive box}} to produce a box of numbered archive links without entering them all manually. To do this, use &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{archive&amp;nbsp;box|auto=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.

Valid parameters for &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{archive list}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; are:
* &lt;tt&gt;root=''&lt;root&gt;''&lt;/tt&gt; to specify a root other than that of the current page from which the template is transcluded
* &lt;tt&gt;links=''#''&lt;/tt&gt; where the number is how many links per line. The default is 10 links per line
* &lt;tt&gt;nobr=''yes''&lt;/tt&gt; set to ''yes'' to remove all line breaks. This parameter cannot be used in conjunction with links=

'''Warning:''' archives numbered past 200 will be ignored.

* {{tl|archive box}}
* {{tl|archives}}

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template is based on {{tl|archive list}}, but produces a longer three-column list, suitable for '''up to 36''' archives. This template can be applied to any talk page or discussion archive, and will return links to all the numbered archives of that page or its parent page. In order for the template to work, the archives must follow the naming convention of &lt;tt&gt;Talk:PAGENAME/Archive 1&lt;/tt&gt;, with a capital A, a space before the number, and no leading zeros. This template should not be substituted – that way, the list of links will update itself whenever a new numbered archive is added. This template can be used with {{tl|archive box}} to produce a box of numbered archive links without entering them all manually. To do this, use &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{archive&amp;nbsp;box|auto=long}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|talk archive}} message box.

It can be placed at the top of archive pages. But some users like to place it both at the top and the bottom of the archive pages.

'''Note!''' Do not subst this template! 

Usually this template needs no parameters. But you can add an optional parameter to specify a different link to the &quot;current talk page&quot;, for instance in cases of page renames/moves or if it's a subpage. Like this:

:{{tlx|talk archive|Talk:Newtalkpage}}

=== See also ===
[[Help:Pages#Archiving]] provides detailed instructions on archiving pages.

* {{tl|archives}} for listing archives of a page automatically or manually in a box at the top of a talk page
* {{tl|closed}} and {{tl|end closed}} to mark a single discussion as being completed, without removing it from the page

==Chemistry Symbols==
I am working on placing a chemistry book online and with all the 'fun' characters in chemistry, I am having the hardest time figuring out how to post an ion. Example: SO&lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{2-}{4}}&lt;/math&gt;, is the closest thing I can get, but I would like the middle line removed. Is there another way to do this?

== Bookmarks ==

Hello!,
I was just browsing the cookbooks, I really liked many recipes and began to copy them to some text document and save them unto the hard disk. So, I just had the idea of making some kind of tool to bookmark the pages you like by clicking on an icon on the top of the page or wherever, and all that without moving from the page you are on, I mean just like the bookmark tool in Firefox or Internet Explorer. I hope my idea is useful, Thanks.--[[User:;Hiba;1|;Hiba;1]] ([[User talk:;Hiba;1|talk]]) 18:51, 12 August 2009 (UTC)

: While not a bad idea in of itself, a tool such as this (as you mention) already exists at the user agent level. If you want to store a list of pages you're interested in here on Wikibooks, you can always add links to your userpage. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 19:00, 16 August 2009 (UTC)

Excuse my question: how and where can I find that???--[[User:;Hiba;1|;Hiba;1]] ([[User talk:;Hiba;1|talk]]) 16:16, 17 August 2009 (UTC)
:[[Special:MyPage]] &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:29, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

I got it!. Thanks!--[[User:;Hiba;1|;Hiba;1]] ([[User talk:;Hiba;1|talk]]) 11:46, 18 August 2009 (UTC)

== Bot permissions ==

Per [[Special:UserGroupRights]], Bots do not have move or reupload permissions, but Autoconfirmed users do.  Is this by design, or should I request this be changed via Bugzilla?   The current rights listing may cause interference in some rare cases (and only for four days, which almost makes it moot if it weren't for the min 10 edits) but given that the bot group implies that it can edit semi-protected pages, it probably should have permissions adjusted to handle other tasks possible under autoconfirmed accounts. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 01:51, 25 August 2009 (UTC)

:If a bot's account is four days old and has made ten edits (possibly as test edits even) then it will be a member of the autoconfirmed users and those permissions will combine with those of the bot group.  Effective permissions would include move and reupload permissions due to all groups a bot would be a member of.  If I had my way I'd remove the &quot;edit semi-protected pages&quot; permission from the bot group since that will be assigned via the autoconfirmed group.  So I could actually take the inverse position to your own. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:15, 25 August 2009 (UTC)

== Sequential Reading ==

One thing that is not sticking out to me if it exists is the ability to read the book pages sequentially, e.g.  when I get to the bottom of a page, I do not see any way to go onto the next topic without first popping up one level to the parent page.  Am I missing something?

If not, then that is my suggestion.  I'd like to see a next / previous page  button or hyperlink on the pages to allow a more book-like read.

HJS  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|comment]] was added by [[User:67.85.166.191|67.85.166.191]] ([[User talk:67.85.166.191|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/67.85.166.191|contribs]]) 01:19, 29 September 2009.&lt;/small&gt;

: Each book has its own conventions for how to handle navigation, partly because there has been no one way that everyone could be happy with:  the more sophisticated navigational aids have been much harder to maintain, so each book chooses a trade-off between ease of use and ease of maintenance.  I've been working (very slowly, as it's in my copious free time, of course) on a set of generic tools that I hope will make maintenance somewhat easier.  So far, it sets things up to look [[Conlang/Beginner/Sounds|'''like this''']].  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 10:58, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

== E-Book Reader Support ==

I'd love to see a way to create an &quot;easy to import&quot; file to popular e-Book readers, with support for the different capabilities of the individual readers.  I'd image it as follows:

Click on e-Book download

Next appears a list of supported e-Book readers.  Right now the big two (or three if you want to count them as separate) would be:

* Sony
* Kindle
* Kindle DX

(The second Kindle has a larger screen and supports a usable version of PDF)

Once you select the reader, a list of the supported formats appears.

Select the format you want.

Finally, a link to the download file (generated on the fly) appears.  This file should include the entire e-Book, not just the page being viewed.  If the format chosen supports navigational aids (table of contents, etc.), then they should also be included in the file.

For those devices which support wireless and/or email delivery, give the option of entering an email address at this point (in accordance with the Terms of Service for the various devices).

This would make WikiBooks much easier for the those people who aren't great on technology.  Most of this is probably already doable, assuming you know what you're doing.  But it would be much easier for those who bought an e-Book reader but are not technologically sophisticated.

[[User:Fcoulter|fcoulter]] ([[User talk:Fcoulter|talk]]) 16:32, 31 July 2009 (UTC)
: Some do support PDF and RTF, but not all do. [[Wikipedia:Amazon Kindle|Amazon Kindle]] did not support PDF formats until Kindle DX, and the Amazon DRM format AZM violates open source licenses which prohibit DRM technology. Amazon.com has a web service that can copy PDF to AZM format so they can download the PDF on a computer, use the web service, and put it on their old Kindle ebook reader. I doubt an open source license would allow porting to a proprietary format as it is not apparently an open source format that I know of and would be no different than printing out to MS-Word DOC formats. [[User:Orion Blastar|Orion Blastar]] ([[User talk:Orion Blastar|talk]]) 02:46, 17 August 2009 (UTC)
: I'm sceptical. Don't these e-book readers support PDFs? What I did to support reading on an iPod touch, was to create PDFs using a large font for each chapter of a book such that you can read it comfortably even on a small display: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Spanish_by_Choice/SpanishPod_newbie_lesson_A0001]. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 08:31, 13 August 2009 (UTC)
::Yes they support PDFs. The ePUB format has some advantages, for example by flowing the text properly to fit the screensize. Gutenberg has a tool that automates the conversion of text to a number of other formats, like the Mobipocket reader one... if that's a free tool, maybe we could grab it? &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

== Book stylesheets ==

This has actually been brought up at least twice before; in [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2007/September#Allowing_each_book_to_have_its_own_CSS_stylesheet|September]] and [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2007/November#Technical_.22Wish_List.22|November 2007]]. The former points to (now) [[n:MediaWiki:Pagecss.js]] for an implementation and there is good support for the idea. The latter includes it in a wish-list, but there is no further mention of it.

Has there been any progress on this? I would be extremely interested in getting this implemented. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:49, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

: This has been implemented already as two separate gadgets. A per-book gadget and a personal per-book gadget. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 08:14, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

:: These gadgets aren't quite what I'm thinking about as they require users to register and opt-in. I take it there has been no further progress past enabling these gadgets. How do people feel about enabling style-sheets that would be used by default? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 09:50, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

: OK, can anyone tell me who to bug about this? Just open a bug? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:25, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

:: Well the requirement to be registered and opt-in could be done [away with], but I believe there was some disagreement over doing that. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:31, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

::: What's the deal, Darklama? You've requested this before yourself. It's a good idea, everyone wants it and it can easily be done safely. Why are you being so passive? You know a lot about the technical details of the software and its implementation here at Wikibooks. Let's put it to use and get this implemented. If you're not interested, just say so. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:20, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

:::: I am interested in doing it, just seems like there was no consensus to do so. I could just as easily do the reverse where people who don't want it can register and opt-out instead. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 03:27, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

::::: Are you saying that you have the server access to implement this? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:49, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

:::::: This doesn't require server access, just access to the MediaWiki: namespace. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 04:12, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

::::::: Sorry! I don't know what happened to the reply I thought I'd left here. Anyway: Great! Then we can get to work on this.
::::::: I suggest we implement something similar to the Wikinews but with a single, book-wide stylesheet (trimming $wgPageName to point to the stylesheet).

:::::::: The gadgets we use now are already loosely based on the same principle as Wikinews. Just requires you to be registered and opt-in rather than having to register to opt-out.

:: I don't know how to write such stylesheets. Could someone please set up a simple demo showing how to have a wikibook with automatically numbered sections and inter-page references (e.g. &quot;see Section 3.2&quot; where &quot;3.2&quot; is an automatically generated section number of a section on a different page of the same wikibook)? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 12:39, 19 January 2010 (UTC)

== A way to number sections and subsections and can we get the Labeled Section Transclusion extension installed? ==

I have searched and searched (and even tried to hack something myself), but there seems to be no way to automatically generate numbers for sections and subsections in a book. By section/sub-section numbering, I mean the common numbering convention whereby a section is numbered X and its subsections X.Y, where both X and Y are integers. This type of section labeling appears in a page TOC, but I can't figure out a way to utilize those numbers in the actual book text. Yes, I know there is a way to turn on numbering in a user's preferences, but that starts the numbering process from 1 on each wiki page. This doesn't work well for books. If there is way to do this that I have just missed, then tell me and I will move this discussion to [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Technical Assistance |technical assistance]].

Rather than create a separate section, I will also mention another request. Is it possible to get the Labeled Section Transclusion extension installed on Wikibooks? I have created a references template for a book I am planning, but it isn't as efficient as I would like. If the Labeled Section Transclusion extension was installed, I could significantly improve its efficiency. Also, I could support Harvard style references.

One possible way to solve the section numbering problem would be to use Labeled Section Transclusion and wrap each section number in the TOC with something like &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;section begin=TOC_&lt;&lt;section name&gt;&gt; /&gt;&lt;&lt;section number&gt;&gt;&lt;section end=TOC_&lt;&lt;section name&gt;&gt; /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, where &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;&lt;section name&gt;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; is the section's name and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;&lt;section number&gt;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; is its number. It would then be possible to reference the number in another page by &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#lst:&lt;&lt;book TOC page&gt;&gt;|TOC_&lt;&lt;section name&gt;&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, where &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;&lt;book TOC page&gt;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; is the name of the page on which the book's TOC appears. If there is a concern that making these changes to the TOC mechanism is risky, another magic word might be added (say, &lt;nowiki&gt;__TOCEXPORT__&lt;/nowiki&gt;) that formats the TOC in the way just suggested, rather than using the standard TOC text format.

Thanks for anyone willing to comment on these requests. [[User:Dnessett|Dnessett]] ([[User talk:Dnessett|talk]]) 17:38, 30 June 2009 (UTC)

: I'm not aware of a reasonable way to do section numbers. Of course, I guess you could have one additional page for each section and subsection which just contains the number. In your table of contents, in the section headings and for any references you would just transclude these pages to show the numbers. Problem is, of course, that you have to edit these pages with section numbers manually, which can get cumbersome if you have to change the numbering of many sections. More generally spoken, the problem appears to be that Wikibooks is not a good place to write textbooks that require section numbers, instead most authors use hyperlinks. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 08:21, 13 August 2009 (UTC)

: This could be done with [[#Book stylesheets]]. See [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/generate.html Generated content, automatic numbering, and lists] in the W3C's CSS specs. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:28, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

== Automatic indexing ==

It would be useful to have a method of automatically creating an index for a wikibook. Perhaps it could be done similar to the way [[LaTeX/Indexing|LaTeX]] does it: a user could place a tag on the page where they want the index to point to, and a bot could automatically generate the index from these tags. —[[User:3mta3|3mta3]] ([[User talk:3mta3|talk]]) 11:28, 18 August 2009 (UTC)

: Do you mean an index of sub-page sections? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:30, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

:: Probably more than that: there may be multiple topics in the one section that deserve to be in the index. There could even be multiple indexes: in the LaTeX wikibook it would be useful to have one for concepts and one for commands. –[[User:3mta3|3mta3]] ([[User talk:3mta3|talk]]) 13:03, 20 January 2010 (UTC)

::: That seems impossible to do automatically in the wiki. One could write an extension and Darklama has thought about this sort of stuff quite a bit. So far it doesn't seem on the horizon. A semi-automatic way would be to add achors, invisible to the reader, that could be parsed by a bot and linked to from an index; but that's another thing I don't see high on anyone's list of priorities. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:01, 20 January 2010 (UTC)

== &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; needs more key words ==

Hi, I'm writing a German Wikibook &quot;Introduction to SQL&quot; [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Einf%C3%BChrung_in_SQL Einführung in SQL] where I'm using &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; for Syntaxhighlighting, see [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi Extension:SyntaxHighlight GeSHi]. Unfortunately, a lot of SQL key words are not highlighted. I suggest to expand highlighting onto the following key word list:
* constraint, commit, rollback; before, after, position; begin, end, then, value
* integer, char, varchar, date, time, timestamp, decimal, numeric
* extract, year, month, day, hour, minute, second
Thank you for improvement! -- [[User:Juetho|Juetho]] ([[User talk:Juetho|talk]]) 08:44, 26 October 2009 (UTC)

: Is there anybody going to listen to my &lt;strike&gt;story&lt;/strike&gt; request? How could one expand highlighting? -- [[User:Juetho|Juetho]] ([[User talk:Juetho|talk]]) 10:32, 21 December 2009 (UTC)

: Sorry there haven't been any replies yet. Have you tried looking at the [[mw:Category:Syntax_highlighting_extensions|MediaWiki syntax extensions]]. I'm not sure what provides the syntax highlighting but I'm sure you can figure that out with a little research. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:02, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

Sorry, I looked at the extension pages, but I don't understand anything. I cannot find any hint how to add key words into the key word list. My intention is that anyone else can read the correct syntax highlighting &amp;ndash; whereever he may use German Wikibooks. I don't want to change the wiki syntax for &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but the key word list only. -- [[User:Juetho|Juetho]] ([[User talk:Juetho|talk]]) 16:02, 17 January 2010 (UTC)</text>

== 30 day limit in &quot;Related Changes&quot; ==

The 30 day limit for listing changes to pages in a given category seems rather short. If I wanted to check the changes since the last PDF version of a book was created, for example, then a longer period would be useful for many books. Is there any reason why this limit could not be increased to 12 months? [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 10:50, 11 March 2010 (UTC)

: Looks like [[mw:Manual:$wgRCMaxAge|$wgRCMaxAge]] is the setting that effects this. I have no idea if there is a reason why the limit is kept where it is. You could try to pursue the community to increase this limit, than file a bug request if the community supports the change at which point either the limit is increased or a reason is given for why the limit cannot be increased. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:37, 11 March 2010 (UTC)

::Increasing the value will not allow us to immediately see recent changes 12 months ago, just that it will start holding onto them for 12 months.  Additionally, I wonder if there would be a performance impact allowing the table to bloat to 12 times its original size.  The default value for it is supposedly 91 days.  Select the 30 day option from the interface, then change the value in the address bar to 90 instead of 30.  Additionally, choose the option for 500 changes and change that to 5000 in the address bar as well.  I did try this on Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book and Blender 3D: Noob to Pro; however, I could only go back as far as February 9.  The developers probably have set a value just over 30 days in the configuration since you can't easily see more than that from what you can click on in the interface.  That points out that even if this value is increased, the interface doesn't give a one-click option for any period longer than 30 days and that would require changes to the Mediawiki software, rather than just the configuration.  While they could change the configuration value, they may not alter the software if sites like Wikipedia don't hold onto changes longer than 30 days for performance reasons; having the option in the interface for that site would be misleading if it doesn't record them longer than 30 days. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:44, 11 March 2010 (UTC)

== Counters ==

This is a small [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Counter counter extension].  Where it is beta code I don't know how appropriate it would be to add it to this site.  But I see it as potentially very valuable for doing things like auto-number exercises, examples, etc. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:35, 14 May 2010 (UTC)
:Is there an example of where it can be applied? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 18:39, 14 May 2010 (HKT)

::Sure, in the [[Linear Algebra]] book, for example.  More specifically consider [[Linear Algebra/Gauss' Method]]. Imagine I want to add a very easy exercise as the first exercise.  Then I need to go through all 22  exercises and increment the number. It is just a bit time consuming, and prone to errors.  Instead I could make an exercise template That has as part of its definition, something to the effect of: &quot;&lt;tt&gt;{{#+: Exercise}} {{#+: ? | Exercise}}&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.  Which, if I understand the documentation correctly, produce &quot;Exercise ''n''&quot; where ''n'' is the number exercise we are on.  Then adding a new exercise would be easy as &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Exercise template|Exercise text}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

::In my dream world one would be able to store a variable directly and recall it later.  This would also allow one to build templates where you could refer to an exercise by some anchor name not visible to the reader and have it appear as &quot;Exercise ''x''&quot; where ''x'' is the correct number.  Maybe it is even possible to do this with this extension, but I think it depends on how the template handles the empty string, order things get evaluated in, etc, etc.  It is very difficult to say without out it being around to play with. Does anyone know if the test.wikipedia adds extensions for one to try out?  Probably not.  But maybe I will try to ask if people here think there is any hope of adding this extension. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 11:02, 14 May 2010 (UTC)

:::In that case I support adding this extension. Is there a wiki that uses this extention? I want to try it out at their sandbox. :) [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 11:08, 14 May 2010 (UTC)

::::: (To [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]) Fair enough.  I figured as much. It would still be very nice though. (To [[User:Kayau|Kayau]]) No wiki uses it that I know of, I just happened upon it. I have asked them to add it at the test wiki, but I think it needs to go through some review process first. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 13:57, 14 May 2010 (UTC)

== Variables. ==

One should never be deterred, so I thought i would try again.  Since my request for counters is clearly cannot work, I thought I might see how the community feels about installing [[mw:Extension:VariablesExtension]].  This extension is listed as stable and used on a few wiki's.  With it I would hope to create automatic numbering and reference templates. The extension simply allows one to store data into a variable, recall data from that variable, and test for existence of the variable.  Before I get feedback I have to comment that this extension probably will not be installed.  There are strong feelings by the developers that this extension will creep wikitext closer to programming.  See [[bugzilla:7865]] for comments regarding the use of this bug on en.wikipedia. Culturally I don't know if not using it on wikipedia means not using it any wikimedia wiki... I suspect the answer is probably yes.  But at the end of the day we are a different project with different needs.  If we aspire to having dozens of mathematics texts following the usual style of numbering and referencing hundreds of problems, theorems, lemmas etc, in each book it seems advisable to find an easier way to handling numbering and references.  (This is probably true for many subjects, but I will leave it to those that know better to decide their needs.)   I do appreciate why you don't want to be able to program within a mediawiki page, so I partially understand their position.  But it is the best option available to us at the moment. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 19:59, 14 May 2010 (UTC)
:Just because Wikipedia doesn't use something doesn't mean Wikibooks can't. Wikiepdia is much more famous, has much more active users and edit counts than Wikibooks — that's what makes Wikipedia different than its other sister projects. If Wikipedia has flagged revs, for example, it would be dead tough for users to edit and be visible and updates are so common in Wikipedia. But in Wikibooks there are enough RC patrollers to sight edits, and every single bit of vandalism can be removed. And there is always the old reviewed pages thing. So that's what make the two projects different, and not implementing an extension on one wiki does not guarantee that it will not be utilised on another. As for the variables extension, I'll try to see what it does before I comment...

:: I agree we are a different project, and so in principle rejection for wikipedia shouldn't mean much for us (unless of course it was for performance issues).  The reason I feel there might be a bit of hesitation is because of [[bugzilla:13894]], which was closed immediately as a duplicate despite being on another project.  Also, comment #5 at [[bugzilla:8570]] I think gets to the heart of the objections against it.  To quote: &quot;... Tim's point was not one of performance [...] but of furthering this nasty trend of taking wiki markup somewhere it should not be going. ...&quot;  A rather frustrating point is that some rather nice automatic numbering is part of html/css, but as far as I can see there is no way to take advantage of that since everything needs to be defined in the pages header.

:::The rationale given on that bug applies to all WMF wikis. That said, there was some recent discussion about enabling some limited &quot;sandboxed&quot; programmatic functions, perhaps using python or (server-side-)javascript, or a new invented pseudolanguage (possibly based on what's used in [[mw:Extension:AbuseFilter|AbuseFilter]]. AFAIK, there's been no agreement among developers on how best to go about doing this, nor any progress in implementation.

==Introduction==

With AmigaOS (TM) 2.0, [http://aros.sourceforge.net/documentation/developers/autodocs/commodities.php Commodities] were introduced to extend the feature of the Amiga Workbench (Desktop). 


The commodities library sets up an handler before intuition's one. When the commodities handler receives a CxMessage 


CxObjects operates on a CxMessage so that it can filter certain CxMessages, translate CxMessages, signal a task when a CxObject receives a CxMessage, send a message when a CxObject receives a CxMessage, or call a custom function when a CxObject receives a CxMessage. 


The controller program is called the Exchange which is great for programs like hot keys, pop ups, screen blankers, and mouse blankers that need to monitor all user input. 


Commodities Exchange should never be used as an alternate method of receiving user input for an application. 

Take a look [http://repo.or.cz/w/AROS.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/workbench/tools/BoingIconBar/iconbar.c here] 


Every Zune application is per default also a Commodity. MUI also does this for you.
Look at MUIA_Application_UseCommodities enabled part (lines 625-660) in muimaster/classes/application.c: it really only seems to set (or avoid if FALSE) the initialization by Zune of your tool as a commodity and the keyboard shortcuts work. 




==Filters==

In creating filters, you should create a broker, attach a filter to it, then a sender. The filter takes in only the events that interest you, and the sender notifies the broker. 



===cx_lib/CxCustom() cx_lib/CxFilter() cx_lib/CxTranslate()===

FKey commodity does use a filter

tooltype «RAWMOUSE LBUTTON RBUTTON MOUSE_RIGHTPRESS» RUN App QUIET DONOTBUT CURRENT TOBACK 

&quot;RAWMOUSE MBUTTON MOUSE_MIDDLEPRESS&quot; 




===cx_lib/CxSender() cx_lib/CxSignal() cx_lib/CxDebug()===

      <text xml:space="preserve">It's a serious matter with all dogs receiving training, but especially with young puppies. They need  lots of encouragement, praise and rewards (positive reinforcement). Begin your puppy training sessions as soon as your little puppy arrives at your home. It's truly is never too early. Set your pet up to succeed, concentrate on developing desirable habits. Put your new friend on the the case path from the start, rather than trying to correct established issue behaviors later on. Keep your training sessions short, consistent and be certain to have fun with your new puppy.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:22, 16 July 2010 (UTC)

== Editor ==

Perhaps you could apply for the editor userright at [[WB:RFP]]. This will save RC patrollers a lot of time. Regards [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 11:01, 14 August 2010 (UTC)

== Please participate ==
Hope you wouldn't mind participating on the &quot;vote&quot; to restore the [[Wikibooks:Administrators#Becoming_a_CheckUser|CheckUser (CU) function]] (mostly used to fight vandalism) to the Wikibooks project, a &lt;u&gt;minimum of 25 expressions of support is required&lt;/u&gt; to grant the flag to administrator Thenub314 (this will also enable admin Adrignola to get the function active again, since there is a minimum requirement of 2 active Wikibookians with the flag). In case you do agree to participate, your vote needs to be added to [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_permissions#Thenub314.C2.A0.28talk.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0email.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0contribs.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0logs.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0rights.29_.28CheckUser.29|administrator Thenub314 request for permission]].

== Templates ==

Templates need to be categorized.  The Blender hotkeys templates need to have &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;{{BookCat}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; on them to add them to the book's template category so that contributors looking to use them can easily find them in an alphabetical index.  New pages also need {{tl|BookCat}} added somewhere on the page if it isn't already in a template on that page resulting in a category at the bottom. Thank you. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:05, 24 August 2010 (UTC)

== Blender book ==
Your doing great stuff on the blender book! I was starting to feel lonely [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 12:28, 5 September 2010 (UTC)

== Move to discussion page?==
what you added to the main page of [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Sources of free 3D models]] seems more like a reader comment, which belongs on the discussion page. so &quot;please&quot; either move it to the discussion page, or rewrite it, so it's 3rd person. thks in advance [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 17:26, 6 September 2010 (UTC)

== [[Blender 3D: HotKeys]] ==

Thanks for fixing my mistake.  Best regards,--[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 14:43, 18 October 2010 (UTC)

== 2.54 screenshots ==

Thanks for providing the 2.54 screenshot.  I worry that we may be working at cross-purposes.  I'm trying to trim back the amount of material before the first model, and you're adding to it.  I'm not sure there's anything to discuss, but I wanted to put it out there.

By the way, do you have any idea how soon the 2.5 line will be stable?  That might affect how much effort I put into updating screenshots to 2.49b.

== [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Blender Interface New]] ==

I'm curious what your plans are for this module.  Are you going to create a bunch of modules specific to the new interface?  If so, how will they connect to the existing modules?  Is there going to be a lot of duplication?  --[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 04:57, 14 November 2010 (UTC)

== Blender Memory Management ==

Why did you put [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Blender Memory Management]] in the Background unit?  It's useful information, sure, but at that point in the book the reader has not yet created an object or a material, has never saved a document, has never seen an &quot;F&quot; button, and has never duplicated anything.  Absent those experiences, memory management will seem very abstract and will make very little sense to the reader.

I want this to be a hands-on textbook, not a technical manual.  One of my guiding considerations in redesigning this book is to minimize the amount of background that readers must wade through before creating their first model and rendering it.  Another is to teach concepts by giving the reader an exercise that uses those concepts.  The earliest place where Memory Management will be of interest to the reader would be the Quickie Material module.  But I'm tempted to move it into the Broadening Horizons unit or even to the appendices.

Please reply, either here or on [[User talk:Stepheng3|my talk page]], and let me know your thoughts. --[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 06:36, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

The following was written in [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Proposals#Proposal_to_change_the_icon_and_definition_of_.22tranwiki.22_at_the_RfDs|this thread]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
People do often misunderstand each-others and by only interacting in writing this problem is exponentiated, but sadly what I've read in this thread is unshakable intention to be unreachable, that is why I state that you have a problem accepting others opinions as having value if they don't conform to your views, rare is the case where you have made a compromise and here again is demonstrated that you are not willing to accept to grant me and my view point an expression, even considering that you will not block my freedom to in the next RfDs express my position as I will, and the point that I was proposing that was in fact originated by our discussion of your talk pages (going from &quot;pushing&quot; the content to request a &quot;pull&quot;) first you state that as your preferred option and then object to it, again how is this productive or the derailing the discussion with references to matters outside of the scope of the discussion or has taken place in your talk pages under a specific context...

Again I refuse to participate in this game. I think my time attempting to reach an understanding has been lost especially if after all I attempted to demonstrate as the goals and benefits you only see that &quot;this discussion is about icons&quot;. Geez Louise... --Panic (talk) 22:08, 15 July 2010 (UTC)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is perhaps a personality defect of mine that I feel the need to defend myself even though I understand full well no good can come of it.  Rather than escalating tensions further by reply directly on a discussion page I will use this page to blow off some steam.

When I read the above paragraph I think to myself that I am not cut out to contribute on a wiki let alone be an administrator on one.  Indeed the first thought to go through my mind was to voluntarily lay down my admin tools, as a symbolic gesture.  If I am really being this disruptive I see it as a serious problem.  There can be little doubt about the fact that I argue my positions with great vigor and vim, and this seems to have caused many &quot;dark clouds&quot; over conversations I have had recently.  To the point I had ''almost'' come to the resolution to not participate in any further conversations.  Actually I did decide to stay away, but was just very bad at it.  

So what bothers me about the &quot;charges&quot; above?  First and foremost the idea that I do not accept others opinions as having value if they don't fall in line with mine.  I would like to provide counterexamples to this idea.   I always thought my interaction with Kayau about the [[Geometry for Elementary School]] was an example of me showing respect to someones ideas that were different than mine.  We disagreed about the definitions the book should take, the tools it should discuss, British/American Spelling, etc.  We talked about these things, and in the end I believe we just simply disagreed.  He has made the changes he saw fit, and I respected them.  

More recently Tomato86 wanted to update the manual of style for [[LaTeX]].  Initially I was not pleased with his suggestions.  Then I decided to accept them, whether or not they agreed with my point of view.  He urged me on to find a compromise we could both live with, and I feel that went very well.  And I am sorry to say I haven't had the time to help him out yet.

Sometimes very fiercely argued positions lead to compromise.  My personal favorite example was a recent RfD with Hagindaz about [[Happiness]].  I was solidly convinced the book did not belong here.  And Hagindaz argued quite well, and found a reference on Positive Psychology.  I spent a few hours reading the reference (as much as amazon would allow anyways), decided happiness didn't quite cover this topic, but it was certainly part of this topic.  This inspired me to look to see if we had a book and the answer was we did, I asked Hagindaz if a merge was acceptable, and he seemed to think it was a good idea.  In the end, others did not agree and I eventually had to close the conversation as not having a consensus and so both books where kept.  

It is in the training of my profession not to be easily convinced, and to pick apart arguments quite carefully.  Otherwise you can never tell a correct proof from an incorrect one.  So I tend to have many replies to what people say.  Perhaps this part of the problem?

But these as I say are just examples.  I am sure many can find places where I have not compromised.  One example that comes to mind was the recent proposal to reconfigure wikibooks.  I was simply set against having the ReaderFeedback Forms enabled on the Main Space pages.  I saw this as a problem pretty quickly and tried to convince everyone to split the conversation so I could hold my stance against this, but support the other changes.  But it was not accepted, as having everything done in one fell swoop reduces the work of the wikimedia folks, which is hard to argue with.  My explanations as to why I thought ReaderFeedback where a lost cause clearly were a lost cause.  I even admitted defeat even as I argued on this point saying something to the effect that &quot;I probably haven't convinced anyone&quot; and tried to offer a compromise.  It was rejected by the community.  This is fine but I felt I couldn't support the changes.  I admit it would have taken something pretty impressive to change my mind.  But on the rest of the proposal I thought I showed I was willing to compromise a lot.  (As did everyone involved, good show!) But to make matters worse I felt things went south at some point. It started when I noticed, what I thought was some innocent but inappropriate canvassing going on trying to get everyone on board supporting one configuration.  At first I just ignored it, I was the sole objecting person so I can understand why I was not part of the canvass. But I maintain that is inappropriate.  So I updated my opinion as I saw was being suggested to other people.  This seems to started a discussion where I needed to restate my opinions again, and was basically told they were not valid.  There was also the feeling (but maybe never said explicitly) that I should move my objections aside so I wouldn't stand in the way.  I must admit I didn't like being pressured into changing my mind.  And things when very south when someone else decided to add themselves to the oppose side.  He was descended upon by multiple editors and told his opinions couldn't possibly make sense, or were contradictory.  Individually maybe each comment was innocent, but it is my opinion it would be impossible to be on the receiving end and not be insulted. To me this made the innocent acts before seem less so, and I felt I had to cry fowl.  Not to disrupt the process, nor to block the process, but to make clear to everyone that maybe we should be very careful to not let something like this happen again.  Since that edit (check my edit summary) I have hoped these changes get made quickly.  I can understand why my actions in this event might be looked upon as bad.  But what can I say?

Since this particular incident the dark clouds have been getting worse.  I argued very fiercely at an RfD for [[Drugs:Fact and Fiction]] a.nd the community opted to keep.  After a bit of soul searching I decided it was necessary for me to clean up this book, since no one else had made the effort in the time following the RfD.  But I am afraid my edits are seen by some as disingenuous POV aimed at subverting community consensus.  What can I say to defend myself?  This is not how I see them.

Later I was rather upset about what I saw as some very bad edits by Panic, and I told him precisely and in no uncertain terms what I thought of them.  Unfortunately I decided to compare them to vandalism, which is offensive to Panic.  I had the further bad judgment to do this on another users talk page, which panic was understandably upset about.  All I can say in my defense was this talk page is where the bulk of the conversation about the book was happening and I wasn't thinking about how it would come across.  I maintain that one editor here should be able to constructively say to another, 'that is a really crappy job' in appropriate language.  But I failed on every level, and was never quite able to set things straight.  

Finally in this recent conversation Panic made a comment &quot;All Wikibookians are volunteers it is not up to you to impose a requirement on any Wikibookians, I was politely excluding myself from that particular game that wasn't leading to what I requested in the first place,... &quot; I felt it was entirely unclear what game he was discussing.  I also disagreed with the comment, so I said so, but provided references back to the appropriate conversations where it was felt I was playing games.  I wasn't intending to derail the conversation with references outside its scope, but if someone is going to publicly accuse me of making requirements as if I had some special authority I felt the need to defend myself.  (Which went badly, as I am sure this will.)

I am not really sure what the last sentence means, but I think he is done attempting to explain to me so I shall forgo asking.

Finally, the only thing I can definitely say definitively is about my intentions.  I never intended to be unreachable, if I had wanted to I would have left my oppose icon and not bothered any more.  But I think there is little I can do to convince anyone of my good intentions.  The fact is others will see my edits at [[Drugs:Fact and Fiction]] as biased POV.  The next time I am in a fierce debate with someone, if they read this conversation they will say &quot;yeah he doesn't value others opinions&quot;.  An accusation is a powerful thing, whether or not it is correct.  

Finally, why would I argue so hard or long over something I thought was really about just an icon?  We have really miscommunicated somewhere.  

Anyways, despite everything I bear no ill will toward Panic for his statements.  The only reason any of us show up to edit here is to improve the project.  Panic and I may have different opinions about how to do this, but on some fundamental level our hearts are in the same place. Which is why I don't choose to defend myself in this original conversation.  It is better to accept looking like an ******* and try to salvage what working relationship we have then to damage it further by continuing to argue. Time to take down the wikistress monitor, I am in a whole new galaxy of whatever it is I am feeling. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 00:18, 16 July 2010 (UTC)

''Siraj Ud din(C)'':


'''Are we safe?'''
&lt;big&gt; A&lt;/big&gt; question which is asked by every computer user, but no one will reply... We are not safe because there is no such operating system which is perfect from security aspects.

Whether we recognize it or not, when we connected to the Internet in our home or office, we are all vulnerable. In fact, connecting to the Internet makes you a member (either willing or unwilling) of a community in which everyone becomes part of an enormous system - one much larger than any individual and where time and distance are almost eliminated. The interconnectivity brings all the participants in a close proximity to each other. Your neighbor next door could be a hacker in a foreign country with intent to harm or a young talented kind searching out your vulnerabilities just for kicks.

We will study Ethical Hacking in the form of modulus.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

==Scope==
This book is a tutorial on creating several different types of virtual machines. The intent is to show the basics of virtual machine design and implementation. The authors will do their best to keep the program code simple and easy to read and understand.

What this book is not about:
* Creating an emulator of the quality exhibited by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAME MAME], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESS MESS], or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VICE VICE].
* Creating a virtualization environment like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qemu QEmu], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualbox VirtualBox], or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vmware VMware].

==Audience==
This book assumes that you have some programming experience and understand the basics of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system binary numbers] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal hexadecimal notation]. Familiarity with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_language machine code] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language assembly language] programming for one CPU or other would also be beneficial, but is not strictly necessary. In fact, I have found that studying a virtual machine to be an effective means of learning an assembly language.

==Required Software==
In order to compile and run the examples you will need to have certain software installed on your computer.

For the [[Creating a Virtual Machine/Register VM in C|Register VM in C]] you will need to have a basic C compiler (a C++ compiler will also work fine).
* Windows users: I recommend [http://www.codecutter.net/tools/quincy/ Quincy]. It is free and easy to use.
* Linux users: Install [http://gcc.gnu.org/ GCC] on your system if it's not there already.Code::Blocks also works fine.
** Debian (&amp; derivative) users open a command shell, become root, and type ''apt-get install gcc''.
* Mac users: Install the [http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html Xcode] package from the extra disk that came with your computer or [http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&amp;mt=12 via the AppStore], for free.

For the [[Creating a Virtual Machine/Stack-Register VM in Java|Stack-Register VM in Java]] you will need to have a fairly recent Java compiler.
* Windows users: Download and install the Java SE JDK from [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp Sun's Java download page].
* Linux users: You may use OpenJDK, but I recommend downloading and installing the Java SE JDK from [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp Sun's Java download page].
* Mac users: You should have Java installed already, or download it from [http://www.java.com/fr/download/help/mac_install.xml java.com].

For the [[Creating a Virtual Machine/Register VM in Erlang|Register VM in Erlang]] you will need to install Erlang.
* Windows users:
* Linux users:
* Mac users: (1) install MacPorts, (2) install Erlang

==Terminology and Definitions==

===Run and execute===
When a computer follows a program's instructions it is said to be ''running'' the program. Another term for ''run'' in this context is ''execute''. This use of the word ''execute'' means ''to carry out'', '' to make happen'', or ''to put into effect''. Computer programmers also talk about killing or terminating a program, but in this context the word ''execute'' is never used.

===We count from 0===
If you have done any Java, C, or C++ programming you will have noticed that when a program does any sort of counting, it usually starts counting from 0. We will do the same in these program examples, not by convention, but by necessity. Some high level languages encourage (or require) counting from 0 because they are based on machine languages which require counting from 0. The reason for this has to do with ''register indexing'', something that should become clear to you as you follow through this book.

===Words are numbers===
When writing programs at a low level such as this, programmers often speak of ''words''. A word in this context is a number, but one that lacks both [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number_(linguistics) cardinality] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number_(linguistics) ordinality] in the normal numeric sense. Instead a numeric word contains [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicography lexicographic] information. Words are often written in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal hexadecimal] notation.

===Other terms===
Before we proceed I thought it would be useful to agree on some terms that tend to be confused or misused in the field. This is not so much to impose my will upon you as it is to establish a context.
; abstract machine : the definition of some machine, usually just 'on paper'
; virtual machine : a software implementation of an abstract machine
; emulator : a software implementation of a real machine

(''Note to self: I think this should probably be moved to a glossary and expanded.'')

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Design==
The first example will be one of the simplest possible architectures, and it will consist of the following components:
# A set of registers (I will arbitrarily choose to have 4 of them, numbered 0 to 3). The registers serve as a group of read/write memory cells.
# A program, which is a read-only sequence of VM instructions
# An execution unit to run the program. The execution unit will read each instruction in order and ''execute'' it.
===Addressing modes===
In any assembly language numbers serve multiple uses. Aside from representing scalar values, they also represent register numbers and memory locations. In this example I will follow the convention of using prefix characters to denote the role a number plays.
* Register numbers begin with the letter ''r'', like ''r0'', ''r1'', ''r2''.
* Immediate (scalar) values begin with the hash mark ''#'', like ''#100'', ''#200''.
* Memory addresses begin with the at sign ''@'', like ''@1000'', ''@1004''.
===Instruction set===
After designing the VM, it is necessary to design the VM's instruction set. The instruction set is simply a reflection of the kinds of things we would like to do (or allow others to do) with this VM. Here are some things it should be possible to do with this VM:
* Load an immediate number (a constant) into a register.
* Perform an arithmetic sum on two registers (i.e., add two numbers).
* Halt the machine.
Let's keep it just that simple for now. After we have a working implementation we can go back and add more instructions.

First let's write a short program using these three instructions to see what they might look like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot; line start=1&gt;
loadi r0 #100
loadi r1 #200
add r2 r0 r1
halt
&lt;/source&gt;
If the VM were to run the program, this is a description of what would happen on each line:
# Load the immediate value 100 into the register ''r0''. Note that placing a value into a register is commonly called a ''load'' operation.
# Load the immediate value 200 into register ''r1''.
# Add the contents of registers ''r0'' and ''r1'' and place the sum into register ''r2''.
# End the program and halt the VM.
Note that in keeping with common convention I have chosen to place the destination registers first in the operand list.

===Instruction codes===
After the assembly language is created it is necessary to determine how to represent each instruction as a number. This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between each instruction in the assembly language and each instruction code in the set of instruction codes. Converting a program from assembly language to instruction codes is called ''assembling'', and conversion from instruction codes back into assembly language is called ''disassembling''.

Several choices we must make at this point are:
* What number is used to represent each assembly language instruction?
* How are instruction operands encoded?
* Are operands part of the instruction word (remember, by ''word'' I mean ''number''), or are they separate words (numbers)?
First, to answer the last question, since there are only small numbers of instructions and registers in this VM it should not be very difficult to encode all operands in a single instruction word, even if (for the sake of simplicity) I were to use a 16-bit instruction word. Thus, a 16-bit number written in hexadecimal has 4 digits, giving us easy access to 4 information fields, each containing 16 variations (0-9 and A-F).
# The first digit of a machine word will be the instruction number. This gives our VM the potential for having up to 16 different instructions. This is a small amount by contemporary standards, but it is plenty for our example virtual machine.
# The next three digits will be used for the operands. These can be used as three 1-digit operands, two operands of 1 and 2 digits, or a single 3-digit operand.
Having made these decisions, let us now establish the encoding. Recall that we have 16 instruction numbers available.

The ''halt'' instruction will be instruction 0, and there is an important reason for choosing 0 for this instruction. Since empty space in the computer's memory will most likely be filled with 0s, any run-away program will eventually encounter a 0 and attempt to execute this instruction, immediately halting the program.

The remaining two instructions can be assigned arbitrarily: the ''loadi'' instruction can be instruction 1, and the ''add'' instruction can be instruction 2. This is our current instruction encoding list:
&lt;pre&gt;
0 = halt
1 = loadi
2 = add
&lt;/pre&gt;
Examining the first program instruction, we see that we must now encode the register and the immediate value:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
loadi r0 #100
&lt;/source&gt;
There are three hexadecimal digits available for operands, so we will use the first of those three as the register number, and the second and third together as the immediate value. Now we have just determined the complete encoding of the ''loadi'' instruction:
&lt;pre&gt;
bits 15-12 = 1
bits 11- 8 = register number
bits  7- 0 = immediate value
&lt;/pre&gt;
The register number for this instruction is 0, and the immediate value is 100, which in hexadecimal is 64 (6 x 16 + 4). Thus, the complete 16-bit hexadecimal instruction code for the first instruction is 1064.

The second instruction is assembled in a similar way. The immediate value is 200, which in hexadecimal is C8. The second instruction assembles to 11C8.

The third instruction is 2201.

The last instruction is 0.

Putting the instructions together, we get these 4 16-bit hexadecimal numbers as the complete program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
1064
11C8
2201
0000
&lt;/source&gt;

==Implementation==
It is now time to implement this design. I have chosen to write this program in C for a number of reasons:
* It's a very simple language that allows the writing of concise programs.
* It's a low level language with some high-level features. This makes it a good choice for creating a VM.
The primary function of the VM will be a ''run'' function that does the following steps in order inside a loop. The loop repeats until the ''halt'' instruction is executed.
# Fetch the next instruction from the program.
# Decode the instruction into its constituent parts.
# Execute the decoded instruction.
Let's begin writing the program.
===Registers===
The first and simplest part to implement is the set of 4 registers.
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#define NUM_REGS 4
int regs[ NUM_REGS ];
&lt;/source&gt;
The registers in this VM are signed integers that are, depending on your computer and operating system, either 16, 32, or 64 bits wide. The exact size is irrelevant for this example.
===Program instructions===
The fully assembled program can easily be stored in an array of integers.
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
int prog[] = { 0x1064, 0x11C8, 0x2201, 0x0000 };
&lt;/source&gt;
===Fetch===
The ''fetch'' function retrieves the next word from the program. In order to do this we must introduce a variable called the ''program counter'' (also sometimes called the ''instruction pointer''). Before the instruction word is returned from the function the program counter must be incremented so that it refers to the next instruction in the program array.
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
int pc = 0; /* program counter */

int fetch()
{
  return prog[ pc++ ];
}
&lt;/source&gt;
===Decode===
The ''decode'' function will decode each instruction completely. It will determine the three operand registers and immediate value for each instruction, even if an instruction doesn't use that part. This actually makes the function simpler. The instruction number and operands are stored in variables.
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
int instrNum = 0;
/* operands: */
int reg1     = 0;
int reg2     = 0;
int reg3     = 0;
int imm      = 0;

/* decode a word */
void decode( int instr )
{
  instrNum = (instr &amp; 0xF000) &gt;&gt; 12;
  reg1     = (instr &amp; 0xF00 ) &gt;&gt;  8;
  reg2     = (instr &amp; 0xF0  ) &gt;&gt;  4;
  reg3     = (instr &amp; 0xF   );
  imm      = (instr &amp; 0xFF  );
}&lt;/source&gt;
===Execute===
The ''execute'' function actually performs the instruction. First there needs to be a ''running'' flag that the ''halt'' instruction can set to 0.
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
/* the VM runs until this flag becomes 0 */
int running = 1;
&lt;/source&gt;
Now the ''eval'' function. It's just a ''switch'' ladder. This function uses the instruction code and operand variables that the ''decode'' function stored values into. Notice that in each instruction case I display the instruction. This makes it easy to follow the program as it runs.
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
/* evaluate the last decoded instruction */
void eval()
{
  switch( instrNum )
  {
    case 0:
      /* halt */
      printf( &quot;halt\n&quot; );
      running = 0;
      break;
    case 1:
      /* loadi */
      printf( &quot;loadi r%d #%d\n&quot;, reg1, imm );
      regs[ reg1 ] = imm;
      break;
    case 2:
      /* add */
      printf( &quot;add r%d r%d r%d\n&quot;, reg1, reg2, reg3 );
      regs[ reg1 ] = regs[ reg2 ] + regs[ reg3 ];
      break;
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Run===
The ''run'' function is rather simple: fetch, then decode, then execute.
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
void run()
{
  while( running )
  {
     int instr = fetch();
    decode( instr );
    eval();
  }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
===Main===
The ''main'' function simply calls the ''run'' function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
int main( int argc, const char * argv[] )
{
  run();
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
==Complete program source==
For your convenience I have included the complete program source in a single block. Note that I have added a ''showRegs'' function in order to see the values of all the registers between instructions. This allowed me to verify that both the VM and the assembled program are working correctly.
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define NUM_REGS 4
unsigned regs[ NUM_REGS ];

unsigned program[] = { 0x1064, 0x11C8, 0x2201, 0x0000 };

/* program counter */
int pc = 0;

/* fetch the next word from the program */
int fetch()
{
  return program[ pc++ ];
}

/* instruction fields */
int instrNum = 0;
int reg1     = 0;
int reg2     = 0;
int reg3     = 0;
int imm      = 0;

/* decode a word */
void decode( int instr )
{
  instrNum = (instr &amp; 0xF000) &gt;&gt; 12;
  reg1     = (instr &amp; 0xF00 ) &gt;&gt;  8;
  reg2     = (instr &amp; 0xF0  ) &gt;&gt;  4;
  reg3     = (instr &amp; 0xF   );
  imm      = (instr &amp; 0xFF  );
}

/* the VM runs until this flag becomes 0 */
int running = 1;

/* evaluate the last decoded instruction */
void eval()
{
  switch( instrNum )
  {
    case 0:
      /* halt */
      printf( &quot;halt\n&quot; );
      running = 0;
      break;
    case 1:
      /* loadi */
      printf( &quot;loadi r%d #%d\n&quot;, reg1, imm );
      regs[ reg1 ] = imm;
      break;
    case 2:
      /* add */
      printf( &quot;add r%d r%d r%d\n&quot;, reg1, reg2, reg3 );
      regs[ reg1 ] = regs[ reg2 ] + regs[ reg3 ];
      break;
  }
}

/* display all registers as 4-digit hexadecimal words */
void showRegs()
{
  int i;
  printf( &quot;regs = &quot; );
  for( i=0; i&lt;NUM_REGS; i++ )
    printf( &quot;%04X &quot;, regs[ i ] );
  printf( &quot;\n&quot; );
}

void run()
{
  while( running )
  {
    showRegs();
    int instr = fetch();
    decode( instr );
    eval();
  }
  showRegs();
}

int main( int argc, const char * argv[] )
{
  run();
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Sample run==
Here is the output from the program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
regs = 0000 0000 0000 0000 
loadi r0 #100
regs = 0064 0000 0000 0000 
loadi r1 #200
regs = 0064 00C8 0000 0000 
add r2 r0 r1
regs = 0064 00C8 012C 0000 
halt
regs = 0064 00C8 012C 0000 
&lt;/source&gt;

This is a template intended for use in software books where the version of software referenced is important. This version is intended for use at the top of pages or sections; for a sidebox version, see {{tl|software sidebox}}.
===Usage===
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{software header|scope=page|name=Inkscape|version=0.47|type===}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

*{{para|scope}} should be ''book'', ''page'', or ''section''. This allows the template to be used for whole books, individual pages of books, or individual sections of pages. Defaults to ''book''.
*{{para|name}} is the name of the software, in this case, ''Inkscape''. Defaults to a linked version of the book's name.
*{{para|version}} is the version of the software in question, in this case ''0.47''.
*{{para|type}} is one of:
**'''&gt;&gt;''', meaning the text references a '''future''' version of the software. ''version'' should be the number of this future version.
**'''&gt;''', meaning the text references ''version'' and all '''newer''' versions. ''version'' should contain '''and newer''' in the text, for example ''0.46 and newer''.
**'''~=''', meaning the text references a '''family''' of versions; for example ''0.4x''.
**'''==''', meaning the text references a '''specific''' version.
**'''&lt;''', meaning the text references an out-of-date, '''older''' version but shouldn't necessarily be removed (in cases where older versions of software might still be in common use), or
**'''&lt;&lt;''', meaning the text references an '''obsolete''' version likely not in-use by anyone in the book's audience.
*{{para|multi|true}} is an optional parameter to show the line &quot;Multiple versions of ''name'' are covered in this ''scope''.&quot; Use this if {{para|version}} covers more than one version.
*{{para|uses|true}} is an optional parameter to replace &quot;applies to&quot; with &quot;uses&quot;, if a book is not specifically ''about'' the software but instead requires the use of certain software.

===Examples===
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{software header|scope=page|name=Inkscape|version=0.47|type===}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
{{software header|scope=page|name=Inkscape|version=0.47|type===}}
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{software header|name=Inkscape|version=0.46 and newer|type=&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
{{software header|name=Inkscape|version=0.46 and newer|type=&gt;}}
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{software header|scope=page|name=[[Inkscape]]|version=0.4x|type=~=|multi=true}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
{{software header|scope=page|name=[[Inkscape]]|version=0.4x|type=~=|multi=true}}
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{software header|scope=section|name=Inkscape|version=0.45|type=&lt;|uses=true}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
{{software header|scope=section|name=Inkscape|version=0.45|type=&lt;|uses=true}}
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{software header|name=Inkscape|version=0.42|type=&lt;&lt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
{{software header|name=Inkscape|version=0.42|type=&lt;&lt;}}
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{software header|name=Inkscape|version=0.48|type=&gt;&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
{{software header|name=Inkscape|version=0.48|type=&gt;&gt;}}
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{software header|scope=page|name=Inkscape|version=0.47}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
{{software header|scope=page|name=Inkscape|version=0.47}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Personally it seems like &quot;scope&quot; would be better than &quot;section&quot;, in that &quot;section&quot; is also an input to the parameter (and not, say {{para|section|yes}}). &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:14, 16 July 2010 (UTC)
:It was previously &quot;SectionType&quot; and &quot;type&quot; was already used by what was previously &quot;DeprecationType&quot;. &quot;scope&quot; sounds much better. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 12:18, 16 July 2010 (UTC)

This is a sidebox version of {{tl|software header}}. 

===Usage===
Parameters are the same as in the documentation listed there, with the following exceptions and additions:
*{{para|scope}} defaults to ''section'' rather than ''book''.
*{{para|side}} defaults to ''right''; can be set to ''left'' to make a box appear on the left side.
*{{para|width}} defaults to ''275px''; can be set to any CSS-valid value for width.

===Examples===
{{software sidebox|scope=page|name=Inkscape|version=0.47|type===}}
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{software sidebox|scope=page|name=Inkscape|version=0.47|type===}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Answer to &quot;Editor&quot; Question ===
This answer cannot be correct. If we consider the situation when a is infinitely high (where a represents the average number of pages required to attract an editor), then the number of editors should be very low due to the low attraction rate. However, the formula suggested in this answer would lead to the number of editors being infinitely high - clearly incorrect.

Perhaps a better solution in this case would be to follow through the formula with n = p/a. I don't think the question is worded clearly enough for a student to follow.
[[User:Qwam|Qwam]] ([[User talk:Qwam|talk]]) 14:14, 16 July 2010 (UTC)

Quite right - thanks for pointing this out. I've corrected it as you suggested. Hopefully it's right this time. If not, then feel free to correct (or even reword) it yourself - that's what wikis are all about! --15:57, 16 July 2010 (UTC)


As an existing Advancing physics student, The &quot;editor&quot; question is still very difficult and requires knowledge not in the specification and indeed not even in most mathematics specifications until the very end, Differential Equations. Having seen a few before, I can see what has been done, but to many they will be a brand new subject. Perhaps a Maths useful for physics sections should be added to the wikibook to include things that are not done yet and to aid those taking advancing physics but not taking maths.

=How to compute and draw Apollonian gasket ? =

==Notation==

* Apollonian gasket = curvilinear Sierpinski gasket =  Leibniz packing = Apollonian packing
* stage = level = step
* incircle = inscribed circle = circle inside 3 circles = inner circle
* gap = curvilinear triangle = ideal triangle ( because the sides are tangent at each vertix and the angle between them is zero) =  region between 3 tangent circles

==Algorithms==
Apollonian gasket can be made using these algorithms &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathpages.com/HOME/kmath113.htm Apollonius' Tangency Problem] at MathPages&lt;/ref&gt;:
* Mandelbrot algorithm &lt;ref&gt;[http://classes.yale.edu/Fractals/CircInvFrac/MandelMethod/MandelMethod.html Mandelbrot's Algorithm] at Fractal Geometry from Yale University by Michael Frame, Benoit Mandelbrot, and Nial Neger&lt;/ref&gt;( using circle inversion)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/15987 Drawing 2D Apollonian gasket with n identical circles ] in Matlab  by Guillaume JACQUENOT &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bugman123.com/Fractals/index.html Apollonian Gasket ] in Mathematica and Povray by Paul Nylander&lt;/ref&gt;

All algorithms give state after n stages. It is an aproximation of limit set which is made of infinite number of stages (cicles).

===Mandelbrot algorithm ===
[[File:Cicle inversion.svg|right|thumb|Gasket made from 4 equal inner circles made with circle inversion]]
[[File:Apollonius problem animation smaller.gif|right|thumb| Animation of the solution to Apollonius' problem using the method of inversion.]]

(to do )

===Soddy's algorithm===
[[File:ApollonianGasket-15 32 32 33-Labels.png|right|thumb|Integer Apollonian gasket defined by circle curvatures of (32,32,33). This image is probably made of 19 stages]]

It will be explained by example gasket with initial configuration : 3 inner circles with integer curvatures

:&lt;math&gt;( k_{ia}, k_{ib}, k_{ic} ) = (32, 32, 33)&lt;/math&gt;



This algorithm uses:
* previous circles defined by centers &lt;math&gt;c_n&lt;/math&gt; and curvatures  &lt;math&gt;k_n&lt;/math&gt;
* circle Descartes theorem to compute curvature of next circle &lt;math&gt;k_4&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; k_4 = k_1 + k_2 + k_3 \pm2 \sqrt{k_1 k_2 + k_2 k_3 + k_3 k_1}&lt;/math&gt;
* complex circle Descartes theorem to compute center of next circle &lt;math&gt;c_4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c_4 = \frac{c_1 k_1 + c_2 k_2 + c_3 k_3 \pm 2 \sqrt{k_1 k_2 c_1 c_2 +  k_2 k_3 c_2 c_3 + k_1 k_3 c_1c_3} }{k_4}&lt;/math&gt;


When center of outer circle is at origin one has to chose solutions in case of centers.
It is easier when the all gasket is in the first quadrant of Cartesian plane. Then all centers have positive parts ( real and imaginary ).

====Functions====

=====Functions for computing curvature and center=====
: &lt;math&gt; f_p(a_1,a_2,a_3)  \overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + 2\cdot\sqrt{a_1 a_2 + a_2 a_3 + a_3 a_1}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; f_{\color{Red}m}(a_1,a_2,a_3)  \overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} a_1 + a_2 + a_3 {\color{Red}-} 2\cdot\sqrt{a_1 a_2 + a_2 a_3 + a_3 a_1}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that variable &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; can be curvature &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;c_i*k_i&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;f_p&lt;/math&gt; can be used for computing both curvatures and centers

=====Functions for computing ck list=====

It is easier to use a list &lt;math&gt;ck&lt;/math&gt; which defines circle. It consist of two element center &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and curvature &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; :

&lt;math&gt;ck = [c,k]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c = ck[1]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;k = ck[2]&lt;/math&gt;

Now one can define new functions ( Maxima CAS code) for computing 4-th circle mutually tangent to 3 given circles:


 f_pp(ck1,ck2,ck3):=block
 ([c4,k4,ck4],
 k4:f_p(ck1[2],ck2[2],ck3[2]),
 c4:f_p(ck1[1]*ck1[2],ck2[1]*ck2[2],ck3[1]*ck3[2])/k4,
 ck4:[c4,k4])$



 f_p&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;(ck1,ck2,ck3):=block
 ([c4,k4,ck4],
  k4:f_p(ck1[2],ck2[2],ck3[2]),
  c4:f_&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;(ck1[1]*ck1[2],ck2[1]*ck2[2],ck3[1]*ck3[2])/k4,
  ck4:[c4,k4]);



 f_&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;mm&lt;/span&gt;(ck1,ck2,ck3):=block
 ([c4,k4,ck4],
  k4:f_&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;(ck1[2],ck2[2],ck3[2]),
  c4:f_&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;(ck1[1]*ck1[2],ck2[1]*ck2[2],ck3[1]*ck3[2])/k4,
  ck4:[c4,k4]);

  f_&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;p_ck4(ck1,ck2,ck3):=block
 ([c4,k4],
 k4:solve_&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;_eq(ck1[2],ck2[2],ck3[2]),
 c4:solve_p_eq(ck1[1]*ck1[2],ck2[1]*ck2[2],ck3[1]*ck3[2])/k4,
 return([c4,k4])
 );


Function &lt;math&gt;f_{pp}&lt;/math&gt; uses &lt;math&gt;f_p&lt;/math&gt; function for computing both center and curvature. It is used for computing almost all circles without outer circle and hard circles

Function &lt;math&gt;f_{pm}&lt;/math&gt; uses &lt;math&gt;f_p&lt;/math&gt; function for computing curvature and &lt;math&gt;f_m&lt;/math&gt; function for computing center. It is used for computing hard circles.

Function &lt;math&gt;f_{mm}&lt;/math&gt; uses &lt;math&gt;f_m&lt;/math&gt; function for computing both center and curvature. It is used for computing outer circle.

====Construction====

[[File:Apollonian rc 6.svg|right|thumb|Apollonian gasket with marked hard circles]]
* initial stage : 3 mutually tangent circles = &lt;math&gt;( k_{ia}, k_{ib}, k_{ic} ) &lt;/math&gt;

* zero stage : 2 circles tangent to previous : outer circle &lt;math&gt;ck_{0out}&lt;/math&gt; and inner circle &lt;math&gt;ck_{0in}&lt;/math&gt;, where :
:&lt;math&gt; {\color{Red}ck}_{0out} = f_{{\color{Red}mm}}(ck_{ia}, ck_{ib}, ck_{ic})  &lt;/math&gt;   

:&lt;math&gt; ck_{0in}  = f_{pp}(ck_{ia}, ck_{ib}, ck_{ic})&lt;/math&gt;

* first stage : there are 6 gaps ( = curvilinear triangles) between previous circles. Three gaps are peripheral ( near outer circle) and three are medial ( near inner circle). Put one circle in each gap :

:&lt;math&gt; ck_{1a} = f_{pp}(ck_{ia},ck_{ib},ck_{0out})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; ck_{1b} = f_{pp}(ck_{ib},ck_{ic},ck_{0out})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; {\color{Red}c}k_{1c} = f_{p{\color{Red}m}}(ck_{ic},ck_{ia},ck_{0out}) &lt;/math&gt;  
:&lt;math&gt; ck_{1d} = f_{pp}(ck_{ia},ck_{ib},ck_{0in})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; ck_{1e} = f_{pp}(ck_{ib},ck_{ic},ck_{0in})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; ck_{1f} = f_{pp}(ck_{ic},ck_{ia},ck_{0in})&lt;/math&gt;

Each new circle placed in the gap makes three new gaps (trifurcation).

* second stage : there are 18 (6*3) new gaps. Put one circle in each gap using &lt;math&gt; f_{pp} &lt;/math&gt; function except one hard circle : 

:&lt;math&gt; {\color{Red}c}k_{2cc}:f_{p {\color{Red}m}}(ck_{ic},ck_{1c},ck_{0out}) &lt;/math&gt;  

* next stages :  Put one circle in each gap at each stage. At each stage there is only one hard circle and it is in &lt;math&gt;1c&lt;/math&gt; gap.

====Algorithm for programmers====

Because all circles are inscribed in outer circle so it is easier to start from it.

* choose size of quadratic image &lt;math&gt;side&lt;/math&gt; 
* compute radius of outer circle :
:&lt;math&gt;r_{0out} = \frac{side}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
* place outer circle in first quadrant of Cartesian plane :
:&lt;math&gt;c_{0out} = r_{0out} + r_{0out}*i&lt;/math&gt;
* compute radius of 3 equall initial circles &lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.stetson.edu/~efriedma/cirincir/ How to pack n circles inside unit circle by Erich Friedman]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a = 1 + \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r_i = \frac{r_{0out}}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
* find centers of initial circles. For example place one circle &lt;math&gt;ia&lt;/math&gt; in upper row and 2 circles (&lt;math&gt;ib&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ic&lt;/math&gt;) in lower row. 
Then centers of these circles are vertices of equilateral triangle, with side of the triangle &lt;math&gt;= 2 * r_i&lt;/math&gt; so :

&lt;math&gt;height = r_i * \sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;c_{ia} = r_{0out} + (2*r_0out - r_i)*i&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{ib} = (r_{0out} + r_i) + (2*r_0out - r_i - heght)*i&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{ic} = (r_{0out} - r_i) + (2*r_0out - r_i - heght)*i&lt;/math&gt;

* compute inner circle &lt;math&gt;0in&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; ck_{0in}  = f_{pp}(ck_{ia}, ck_{ib}, ck_{ic})&lt;/math&gt;

* &quot;Now we have a configuration to start&quot; &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.bogotobogo.com/svg_source/Apollo15323233.svg SVG Math Animation Example: Apollonian Gasket (-15,32,32,33) by KiHyuck Hong. See the src code.]&lt;/ref&gt; There is 6 gaps to fill. 5 gaps are easy and one gap &lt;math&gt;1c&lt;/math&gt; is hard to fill.

====Relation betwen circles ====

:&lt;math&gt; {\color{Red}ck}_{0out} = f_{{\color{Red}mm}}(ck_{ia}, ck_{ib}, ck_{ic})  &lt;/math&gt;   

:&lt;math&gt; ck_{0in}  = f_{pp}(ck_{ia}, ck_{ib}, ck_{ic})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{\color{Red}ck}_{ia}=f_{{\color{Red}mm}}(ck_{ib},ck_{ib},ck_{0out})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c{\color{Red}k}_{ib}=f_{{\color{Red}m}p}(ck_{ia},ck_{ic},ck_{0out})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{\color{Red}ck}_{ic}=f_{{\color{Red}mm}}(ck_{ia},ck_{ib},ck_{0out})&lt;/math&gt;

==== Number of circles ====

* number of new circles at stage n =   &lt;math&gt;2*3^n&lt;/math&gt; 
* total number of circles after n stages = &lt;math&gt;2 + 3^{n+1} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n&gt;=0&lt;/math&gt;

For example :
* stage -1 = initial cofiguration ( 3 inner circles )
* stage 0 gives 2 new circles ( one outer and one most inner ). All circles = 5
* stage 1 gives 6 new circles ( all circles = 11 ) 
* stage 2 gives 18 new circles ( all circles = 29 )
* stage 3 gives 54 new circles ( all circles = 83)
* stage 4 gives 162 new circles ( all circles = 245)
* stage 5 gives 486 new circles ( all circles = 731)
* stage 6 gives 1 458 new circles ( all circles = 2 189 )
* stage 7 gives 4 374 new circles ( all circles = 6 563 )
* stage 8 gives 13 122 new circles ( all circles = 19 685 )
* stage 9 gives 39 366 new circles ( all circles = 59 051 )
* stage 10 gives 118 098 new circles ( all circles = 177 149 )
* stage 11 gives 354 294 new circles ( all circles =  531 443 )
* stage 12 gives 1 062 882 new circles ( all circles =  1 594 325 )
* stage 13 gives 3 188 646 new circles ( all circles =  4 782 971 )
* stage 14 gives 9 565 938 new circles ( all circles =  14 348 909 )
* stage 15 gives 28 697 814 new circles ( all circles =  43 046 723 )
* stage 16 gives 86 093 442 new circles ( all circles =  129 140 165 )
* stage 17 gives 258 280 326 new circles ( all circles =  387 420 491 )
* stage 18 gives 774 840 978 new circles ( all circles =  1 162 261 469 )
* stage 19 gives 2 324 522 934 new circles ( all circles =  3 486 784 403 )
* stage 20 gives 6 973 568 802 new circles ( all circles =  10 460 353 205 )


It can be computed using this [[Maxima |Maxima CAS]] code :

&lt;pre&gt;
 NumberOfStageCircles(stage):= 
  if stage =-1 then 3
  elseif stage=0 then 2
  else 2*3^stage;


 NumberOfAllCircles(stage_max):=sum(NumberOfStageCircles(i),i,-1,stage_max);

for i:-1 step 1 thru 20 do print(&quot;stage &quot;,i,&quot; gives &quot;,NumberOfStageCircles(i),&quot; new circles ( all circles =  &quot;,NumberOfAllCircles(i), &quot; )&quot;);
&lt;/pre&gt;


Number of circles grows rapidly and makes problems caused by big file size. One can : 
*use only stages up to 5-7. It seems to be sufficient to give good image in a short time. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.bogotobogo.com/svg_source/Apollo15323233.svg SVG Math Animation Example: Apollonian Gasket (-15,32,32,33) by KiHyuck Hong]&lt;/ref&gt;
* do not draw circles which are small ( have a small radius &lt; pixel size) &lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:Apollonian_gasket.svg|File Apolonian gasket ]] containes about 8140 circles, but it looks like made of about 20 steps. So it should have about 10 460 353 205 circles&lt;/ref&gt;
* convert svg file to png ( for example using Image Magic : &quot;convert a.svg a.png&quot; ). Then for stage 12 svg image has 128 MB and png file only 57 KB.
* be happy that you have so detailed picture and wait a long time to load file or see how system hangs up (:-))

====Curvatures====

Note that only one curvature has been computed with &lt;math&gt; f_{\color{Red}m}&lt;/math&gt; function.

It is &lt;math&gt;k_{0out}&lt;/math&gt;. It is also only one negative curvature.

All the rest have been comuted with &lt;math&gt;f_p&lt;/math&gt; function.

[[File:RandomApollonianCircleFractal.svg|right|thumb|Random Apollonian circle fractal]]


This is an incremental algorithm that maintains a queue of triples of touching circles.  The
main loop starts at the front of the queue, removing a triple and filling it with the required
circle, adding the resulting circle to a list of circles to draw as SVG and adding the three
triples that result from adding the circle to the back of the computation queue.  As a bonus
feature, the circles are coloured so that no two neighbours have the same colour.

Usage: concatenate the two SVG boilerplate parts and the middle Javascript part into one SVG
file and load into a web browser (or another SVG viewer that supports Javascript or ECMAScript).

This page is an introduction to the R programming language. It shows how to perform very simple tasks using R. First you need to have R installed (see the [[R Programming/Settings|Settings]] page). If you use Windows or Mac OS, the easiest solution is to use the R Graphical User Interface (click on its icon). If you use Linux, open a terminal and type &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; at the command prompt.

Usually when you open R, you see a message similar to the following in the console:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;

Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)

R is a collaborative project with many contributors.
Type 'contributors()' for more information and
'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.

Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or
'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.
Type 'q()' to quit R.

&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can type your code after the angle bracket &lt;code&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. 

R can be used as a simple calculator and we can perform any simple computation. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt; 
&gt; # Sample Session 
&gt; # This is a comment
&gt; 
&gt; 2 # print a number
[1] 2
&gt; 2+3 # perform a simple calculation
[1] 5
&gt; log(2)
[1] 0.6931472
&lt;/source&gt;

We can also store numeric or string objects. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; x &lt;- 2 # store an object
&gt; x # print this object
[1] 2
&gt; (x &lt;- 3) # store and print an object
[1] 3
&gt; 
&gt; x &lt;- &quot;Hello&quot; # store a string object
&gt; x
[1] &quot;Hello&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

We can also store [[R_Programming/Data_types#Vectors|vectors]]. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; Height &lt;- c(168, 177, 177, 177, 178, 172, 165, 171, 178, 170) #store a vector
&gt; Height  # print the vector
 [1] 168 177 177 177 178 172 165 171 178 170
&gt; 
&gt; Height[2] # Print the second component
[1] 177
&gt; Height[2:5] # Print the second, the 3rd, the 4th and 5th component
[1] 177 177 177 178
&gt; 
&gt; (obs &lt;- 1:10) # Define a vector as a sequence (1 to 10)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
&gt; 
&gt; Weight &lt;- c(88, 72, 85, 52, 71, 69, 61, 61, 51, 75)
&gt; 
&gt; BMI &lt;- Weight/((Height/100)^2)   # Performs a simple calculation using vectors
&gt; BMI
 [1] 31.17914 22.98190 27.13141 16.59804 22.40879 23.32342 22.40588 20.86112
 [9] 16.09645 25.95156
&lt;/source&gt;

We can also describe the vector with &lt;tt&gt;length()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;mean()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;var()&lt;/tt&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; length(Height)
[1] 10
&gt; mean(Height) # Compute the sample mean
[1] 173.3
&gt; var(Height)
[1] 22.23333
&lt;/source&gt;

We can also define a [[R Programming/Data types|matrix]]. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; M &lt;- cbind(obs,Height,Weight,BMI) # Create a matrix
&gt; typeof(M) # Give the type of the matrix
[1] &quot;double&quot;
&gt; class(M)  # Give the class of an object
[1] &quot;matrix&quot;
&gt; is.matrix(M) # Check if   M is a matrix
[1] TRUE
&gt; is.vector(M)  # M is not a vector
[1] FALSE
&gt; dim(M)    # Dimensions of a matrix
[1] 10  4
&lt;/source&gt;

We can plot the data using &lt;tt&gt;plot()&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt; 
&gt; plot(Height,Weight,ylab=&quot;Weight&quot;,xlab=&quot;Height&quot;,main=&quot;Corpulence&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

We can define a [[R_Programming/Data_types#Data_Frames|dataframe]]. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt; 
&gt; mydat &lt;- data.frame(M) # Creates a dataframe
&gt; names(mydat) # Give the names of each variable
[1] &quot;obs&quot;    &quot;Height&quot; &quot;Weight&quot; &quot;BMI&quot;   
&gt; str(mydat)   # give the structure of your data
'data.frame':   10 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ obs   : num  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
 $ Height: num  168 177 177 177 178 172 165 171 178 170
 $ Weight: num  88 72 85 52 71 69 61 61 51 75
 $ BMI   : num  31.2 23 27.1 16.6 22.4 ...
&gt; 
&gt; View(mydat)  # Look at your data
&gt; 
&gt; summary(mydat)  # Descriptive Statistics
      obs            Height          Weight           BMI       
 Min.   : 1.00   Min.   :165.0   Min.   :51.00   Min.   :16.10  
 1st Qu.: 3.25   1st Qu.:170.2   1st Qu.:61.00   1st Qu.:21.25  
 Median : 5.50   Median :174.5   Median :70.00   Median :22.70  
 Mean   : 5.50   Mean   :173.3   Mean   :68.50   Mean   :22.89  
 3rd Qu.: 7.75   3rd Qu.:177.0   3rd Qu.:74.25   3rd Qu.:25.29  
 Max.   :10.00   Max.   :178.0   Max.   :88.00   Max.   :31.18  
&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;

You can save an R session (all the objects in memory) and load the session.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; save.image(file=&quot;~/Documents/Logiciels/R/test.rda&quot;)
&gt; load(&quot;~/Documents/Logiciels/R/test.rda&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

We can define a working directory. Note for Windows users : R uses slash (&quot;/&quot;) in the directory instead of backslash (&quot;\&quot;).
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; setwd(&quot;~/Desktop&quot;)            # Sets working directory (character string enclosed in &quot;...&quot;)
&gt; getwd()                       # Returns current working directory
[1] &quot;/Users/username/Desktop&quot;
&gt; dir() * Lists the content of the working directory 
&lt;/source&gt;

There are some special characters in R
* &lt;tt&gt;NA&lt;/tt&gt; : Not Available (ie missing values)
* &lt;tt&gt;NaN&lt;/tt&gt; : Not a Number (eg 0/0)
* &lt;tt&gt;Inf&lt;/tt&gt;: Infinity
* &lt;tt&gt;-Inf&lt;/tt&gt; : Minus Infinity.
For instance 0 divided by 0 gives a &lt;tt&gt;NaN&lt;/tt&gt; but 1 divided by 0 gives &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
 &gt; 0/0
 [1] NaN
 &gt; 1/0
 [1] Inf
&lt;/source&gt;

We can exit R using &lt;tt&gt;q()&lt;/tt&gt;.  The &lt;tt&gt;no&lt;/tt&gt; argument specifies that the R session is not saved.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
q(&quot;no&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;</text>
