;The action of the TA template with no pass parameter is shown above. It forms a link to the AM&amp;C TOC page.
&amp;nbsp;

[[Category:Trainz link templates|AM&amp;C,{{PAGENAME}}]]
[[Category:Self-documenting templates|AM&amp;C,{{PAGENAME}}]]

;usage
This template forms an internal link to the [[Trainz]] wikibook with {{TN|placeholder parameter}} &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and incorporates an option to access a sub-sub-page given the optional 3rd default parameter: &lt;code&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as well allowing for as an optional pretty-link re-title parameter &lt;code&gt;'2' allowing &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}} and/or '|3=sub-page/' &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; formatted link calls ... all forming the link and all links in the wikimarkup as:&lt;br/&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/AM&amp;C/{{{3|}}}{{{1}}}|{{{p|{{{2|{{{1}}}}}}}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/code&gt;
* Users unfamiliar with wiki-markup parameter parsing, just focus on &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}} or '|2=text' &lt;/nowiki&gt; overriding the presented text of the link, 
* and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}/  or '|3=sub-sub-linktext/' &lt;/nowiki&gt; giving a prefix to a sub-sub-page, so the subject page is:
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/AM&amp;C/{{{3}}}/{{{1}}} | {{{2}}}]], pipe-linked as {{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
: if and when given, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}/&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;u&gt;MUST HAVE&lt;/u&gt; a trailing '/' to form a proper link.
&amp;nbsp;
The observant and discerning reader will have noted the ''''| p='''' for'' 'pretty parameter' ''overrides ''''2'''', as it does for most all {{lc|Trainz link templates}}. 
&amp;nbsp;
'''&lt;u&gt;Example-1, expanded paste down&lt;/u&gt;:'''
:This is because all template default parameters, formally 'numbered parameters' can also be specified like this:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TA
 |1=Tips And Tricks
 |2=Tips
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 which ''in wiki-markup language'' is processed exactly
 the same as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TA |Tips And Tricks |Tips }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
&amp;nbsp;
{{TRS-warning|other=&lt;small&gt;caution|
When using a template such as this which forms a link, it is best to NOT use spaces between the pipe characters &quot;{{!}}&quot; as done for clarity above.&lt;/small&gt;}}
{{TrainzTip|'''However...''' ''Spaces in the 'pretty-text' part are fine and dandy!'' Indulge yourself in clarity!
}}
'''&lt;u&gt;In-line Examples&lt;/u&gt;:'''
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TA|Tips And Tricks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; links as: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/AM&amp;C/Tips And Tricks|Tips And Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the other formulation: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/AM&amp;C/Tips And Tricks|Tips And Tricks]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; both would.
:But... is much easier to edit around on a page when trying to get the best prose presentation.

* Similarly: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{TA|Tips And Tricks|Tricks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; links as if the constructs: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/AM&amp;C/Tips And Tricks|Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/AM&amp;C/Tips And Tricks|Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is perhaps part of the phrase you want.
Which do you think is easiest to look past in a paragraph filled with prose and multiple links?
&amp;nbsp;
* Sub-subpage links will mainly be needed in the forthcoming Errorfixing series of tutorials and the Programmed Instruction (Trainz A-Z) linked progressive tutorials off their own sub-TOC base page. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:Planned use of Sub-sub-pages... '''Better than splitting the book down the multiple tracks'''... we're going to make ''a lot of new pages'' in the PI tutorials! Whether for beginners or intermediate Trainzers, they'll all end in content creation and other advanced topics like TransDEM map generation anyway.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

{{recipe}}

== Ingredients ==
* 1/2 loaf dry bread
* 750 ml tomato paste
* 1-2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves, crushed and finely chopped, more if you like it
* Oil
* handful of well ripped [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] leaves
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], to taste

== Procedure ==
# Soak the bread in water for a short time, so that you can crush it with your hands. It should not be soaked. Fry the garlic in a large frying pan with oil until it begins to change color.
#Add the tomato puree and salt and cook over medium heat until it gets to a boil.
#Add pieces of bread in, none smaller than a walnut, after wringing and continue to mix it with the tomato, until it has become completely red.
#At this point the tomato should still have a fresh aroma.
#Remove from heat and serve hot in a bowl, seasoned with a drizzle of olive oil, pepper and a basil leaf.

== Scarcity ==
Economics as a discipline would not exist without scarcity.

This is the fundamental problem that all societies face. It refers to the escess of human wants over what can actually be produced to fulfill these wants. Human wants are unlimited. On the other hand, the means of fulfilling these human wants are limited becacuse the resources available are limited. As a result, choices have to be made.

For example, society cannot enjoy all the books and all tables if wants because the number of trees required to produce these goods is limited. It somehow has to decide how many books and how many tables it wants to produce. If mroe tables are produced then fewer books will be enjoyed and vice versa. We define as the opportunity cost of a choice, the value of the enxt best alternative sacrificed . If, for example, by giving (or more correctly, &quot;allocating&quot;) a tree to table produciton, one extra table is produced but 25 books need to be sacrificed, we say that the opportunity cost of producing one more table is 25 books.

=== Resources (factors of production) ===
Resources are also referred to as factors of production. They includje all inputs used in the production of a good or service. They are typically separated into the following categories.
==== Land and raw materials (natural resources) ====
These are inputs into produciton that are provided by nature, for example agricultural and non-agricultural land, forests, pastures, mineral deposits, oil, natural gas, lakes, and rivers. The world's land area and raw materials are limited. SOme resources, such as oil and coal deposits, are non-renrewable: if they are used now, they will not be available in the future. Other resources, for example forests (timber) and the stock of fish, are renrewable.

==== Labour (human resources) ====
Labour includejs all forms of human inputi, both physical and mental, into current production. The labour force is, at any point in time, limited both in number and in skills. The total number of people avilable for work is referred to as the labour force or working population.

==== Capital ====
Physical capital includejs manufactured resources; in other words, goods used to produce other goods. The world has a limited stock of capital (limited supply of factories, machines, tools, and other equipment). Note that the meainng of capital in economics is different from that used in ordeinary speech where people refer to money as capital.

==== Entrepreneurship ====
Entrepreneurship is related but not identical to management. When a new venture is being considered, risks exist. They involve the unknwon future. Someone must assess these risk and make judgements about whether or not to undertake them. The people who do so are called entrepreneurs. Entrpreneurship refers to the willingness and ability of certain individuals to take risks and to mobilise the remaining factors of production.

=== Related concepts ===
In addition to the ide,a of physical capital already mentioned, it is usef to includej natural capital and human capital.
==== Natural capital ====
Natural capital can be thought of as natural resources which may be improved upon or may be depleted. Thinking in terms of natural capital can easily accommodate another related concewpt, sustainability, which refers to the idea of preserving and even inccreasing or improving upon the avilable stock of natural resources.

==== Human capital ====
Labour may also be improved upon, in that the labour force may become mroe productive. The term human capital refers to the education, training and skills embodied in the labour force of a country. Even if the size of the labour force of an economy is constant over time, the stock of human capital may increase.

=== Other useful introductory terms ===
==== Social sciences ====
Disciplines that symentically study human behaviour form different perspectives. Economics, pyschology, anthropoligy, political science, sociology, and history we all considered social sciences.

==== Models ====
==== Normative economic statements ====

'''Status: This class project is in its initial stage.'''

This book is the result of the course 'Introduction to Programming with Unity', taught in the [http://www.th-nuernberg.de/ohm/mediaengineering/ media engineering] program at Technische Hochschule Nuremberg.  It  is a [[Wikibooks:List_of_class_projects|class project]], hopefully turning into a real wikibook at some later point in time.

= Preface =
This book/class is supposed to give a hands-on experience related to programming with the Unity Game Engine.  Different aspects will be looked at.  Most likely this book will be outdated as soon as it is finished, but for a little while it may serve as an entrance to the world of game programming.

The idea behind this class project came from a colleague who suggested that most class projects produce really nice results, but usually disappear in some instructors' drawers.  After reading on the possibility of using Wikibooks for class projects, we just had to give it a try.  


== Getting Started ==
If you are new to Wikibooks, you might first want to look at [[Using Wikibooks]].  Details for creating a class project can be found at [[Using_Wikibooks/Class_Project_Guidelines|Class_Project_Guidelines]].  If you are completely new to Wikipedia, the [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tutorial Wikipedia tutorial] maybe helpful to you.  If you like to upload images to wikipedia, use the 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard File Upload Wizard].  However, only upload images if you created them and you own the copyright!


== Other Wikibooks ==
There are also other wikibooks on subjects related that are quite useful:
*[[Game_Creation_with_XNA]]
*[[Cg_Programming]]
*[[C_Sharp_Programming]]


== Other Class Projects ==
Inspiration from successful class projects can be drawn here, which by themselves are also quite interesting and maybe helpful for this project:
*[[Basic Writing]]
*[[Handbook for Doctoral Students in Education]]


== Experience from the First Iteration ==
No experience yet.

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
== Introduction To CM/CMP==
{{Main|Trainz/Content Manager Plus}}
;Background to the Content Manager and the DLS {{void|
Predecessors to '''CM''' or '''CMP''' were a stand alone utilities from Trainz 1.0 through TRS2004-SP4 ''(also named '''ContentManager.exe''',. hence the 'Plus' of TRS2006's CMP)'' with which users could install new modeling assets. There weren't many options but installing assets. Other utilities performed some of the tasks (e.g. uploading) but Data Management was mainly manual by moving folders about.
&amp;nbsp;
In essence the early simple ContentManager.exe programs did some simple file management and unpacked {{TG|CDP|cdp}} files and tucked their contents away in a scheme using open folders, {{TG|E|enumerated}} folder locations, and a data system that had no real data base to it. They could also create cdp files, allowing the early growing Trainz community to feast on shared creations. Eventually, the early {{TL|Download Station}} was hosted by Auran and users could browse without much search capability much as one can on today's less sophisticated 3rd party Trainz fan-sites. Most of these are operated by an individual or a small group of {{TL|Content Creator}}s.
&amp;nbsp;
Prior to TRS2004, the cloud services we know as the DLS was more list presenting access to a disorganized collection of zip and cdp files than an organized database with a built in search engine, FTP manager. It was a central repository but a chaotic one, and the chaos was converted into today's order when DLS was established during {{TL|UTC}}'s hey days (v1.5), a little before the time TRS2004 (v2.0) came about. 
&amp;nbsp;
===The need for CMP===
The early local Trainz {{TG|I|install}}'s database was more organized as groups of open files as well, and data corruption was thus more likely until TRS2004 evolved a better file structure and compressed data formats, which was best exploited with the advent of TRS2006 and it's ''Content Manager Plus'' became a data base manager and search &amp; access tool. With a database manager on the servers to handshake with on the DLS end, the more sophisticated user-end software became feasible and it arrived with trainz-build v2.5 ({{TL|TRS2006}} Content Manager&amp;mdash;then retitled as '''{{TL|Content Manager/Content Manager Plus|Content Manager Plus}} (or {{TL|CMP}})'''. 
&amp;nbsp;
===The powers of CMP===
CMP had capabilities unknown in the earlier Trainz which relied on a primitive {{TBS|region}} and {{TBS|type}} tags classification system for it's limited capabilities of asset grouping and searching. CMP took on a whole host of additional capabilities formerly performed by separate *.exe utility programs, including those of 3rd party providers, and incorporated a ton of new powerful search, classification, and asset management features such as:
# the ability to directly communicate with the {{TL|Download Station}} (DLS) during searching
# could import content from installation to installation by direct file importing/parsing
# or via cdp importation,
# export a route or asset or
# upload it to share with others on the DLS
# manage asset editing
# manage and use archives and archiving
# search by combining criteria and classification
 
and generally became the center-point for asset operations not involving actually building a route. {{TrainzTip|Today's '''TS12 CM-3.7''' (often still referred to as CMP on the forums) has the same functions (with some extensions), much the same look and feel, and in operations, has varied little save for searching enhancements from the TRS2006 era CMPs. The content manager in the forthcoming '''Trainz: A New Era (TANE)''' will be a very different user interface than the one described here with the fixed left pane and will have an ability to locate windows, each of which may then spawn an alternative sub-search and display 'main view'.}}

&amp;nbsp;

===Launching CM/CMP===
CM/CMP ('''Content Manager Plus''') is accessible via the Trainz launcher screen or by directly launching the ContentManager.exe file from the Trainz installation's root directory \bin sub-folder. Many users with multiple Trainz installations will bundle shortcuts to launch the CM or Trainz launcher programs from a common Trainz folder. CM's primary purpose is to manage the data flow to and from the DLS and manage the local assets on your hard drive (located in your '''[[Trainz\The UserData folder|..\UserData folder]]) and the subfolders therein (such as the \local, \settings, \screenshots, \editing folders) as well as the Trainz release's special data base of built-in items. (See {{TG|JA files}} and {{TG|l|Libraries}})

Mainly Trainzer's use it to communicate and manage downloading from the DLS, and to select and filter assets for surveyor. TS2009 introduced enhanced filtering (selectable savable criteria) so power users will often define a search criteria, called a {{TA|search filter}}, save that and then use that to trim down the list of assets one must look through to find a desired asset when route building.
 
CM/CMP has a sophisticated search facility and automatically identifies and downloads {{TG|dependencies}} associated with each asset. CM/CMP is closely integrated to {{TG|C|CCP}} and is also used to open assets for editing and committing them for use in Trainz. In TRS2006 and above, new assets and asset clones (copies with new kuids) are created via CM/CMP, though a {{TL|route}} or {{TL|session}} may be cloned using a Save As option in {{TL|Surveyor}}. 
 
{{TrainzTip|The original 'Content Manager Plus' precursor page to this page was overhauled in March 2014, and the 'Blog' section within it is so charmingly written ''and mostly still applicable'', (from an experiential point of view, it gives the flavor of using the CMs your first few time really well--provided sounds are enabled!) It was worth retaining for new users, so take time to read it. After wrestling with CM a month or so, re-read it and laugh at what you missed the first time. Despite the improvements, the operations are so very similar it's worth taking the'' 'grin-making' ''time after you've acquired some CM operations experience.
}}

==Getting around in CM==
CMP through CM-3.7 looks much like a spreadsheet with relocatable columns (from CM-2.0 of TS2009) meaning columns selected for viewing in the ''''''main view'''''' (the right hand part of the screen) using {{kp|ALT|V}} can later be slide left or right and rearranged to suit the user preferences, or the type of task you might be about. For example, one day you might want to locate all the assets that were installed with the download of XYZ route and sessions, so want to see install date... an otherwise uninformative data column. Some days you want modification date, and on others perhaps, the regions, era or the trainz-build values are your primary sorting and searching interests. The check box in the {{kp|ALT|V}} menu allow hiding columns or turning their display on, whilst dragging them allows you to rearrange them left to right.
;title bar notations
The notations '''CM-X.Y''' appears in the CM/CMP title bar after {{TL|TC3}} and after TS2009-SP3 the X.Y (initially just CM-2.0) was incremented with each {{TG|C|code build}} and so displayed as a suffix to give a visual reminder of the {{TR|T|trainz-build}} or 'version' of the Trainz software. It now signifies the trainz-build code an asset created or updated using {{TL|Content Creator Plus}} ({{TL|CCP}}) editing will be given.
 
;Editing modes
CM supports asset editing in two forms: CCP, which is a table-like fill in the blanks rigid form for getting the proper parts assigned to a new asset, or by free form editing using Windows utilities. For asset repairs, virtually everyone avoids CCP and uses a Windows Explorer editing folder with direct access to the files making up the asset. This folder and files can be opened in several ways:
# Hotkeys {{kp|SHFT|CTRL|E}} directly opens a Windows Explorer folder with no processing, and it pops up immediately on top of other screen windows.
# {{kp|RMBH+drag|Open With}} accesses one of the PEVtools or other batch utility that has been installed in the \bin\...\Tools sub-folder. Thusly, for example, if a repair requires accessing textures (say in the error message you see an alphamask and it's base texture don't match in size, so one needs re-sized) one can open the asset with PEV's images2TGA utility and be ready to fix the problem immediately. In this case the window will often be behind or other another Windows application window depending upon your video set up and the biases built-in to Windows. If running a dual or three monitor system, often these can be biased to open in the other screen(s) from CM, so will open where it can be seen immediately.
==Left hand panes==
[[file:Image of TS12's left hand control windows or panes|thumb|left|250px|Image of TS12's left hand control windows or panes (most closed). &lt;br/&gt;1. the DLH opens as the top 2. the Search window opens next down, and 3. the details pane third.&lt;br&gt; each when minimized looks like the other tool bars on the bottom, saving the labels.]]
In truth, the left hand panes are an overcrowded mess cramped for space since TRS2006 was written long enough ago (2004-2005) that dual and triple head systems were very rare, and the arrangement made sense for single monitor systems. The alpha-test software for TANE will have an entirely different look, see, and feel with floating and resizable windows. Each left hand pane has a little click icon to open it or close it, and in normal operations, one will be the DLH (Download Helper) pane, another the Asset Details pane, and as needed, the search pane. Other panes are for uploading, archiving, and so forth. Play a bit and read the manual, whether printed or in pdf format, then re-read it. Wait a month and read it again. Each time will give you the power of additional knowledge and insights as to the capabilities shedding further light on what we present herein.
}}&lt;!-- end {{void()
---&gt;
===Download Helper===
Buttons are straight forward, {{kp|Start}}, {{kp|Clear}}, {{kp|Stop}}. With nothing in the pane, it's already cleared. To pick something for download, one sets up a search criteria (below) then clicks on one or more assets to select them (Highlighted, colors of CM and highlighting are as you set them in your Windows theme) then drag them into the DLH pane. As you add more you'll likely note some activity going on, part of which is CM and the DLS are filling in dependencies&amp;mdash;sub-assets the asset you selected depend upon as parts, for example the bogeys, wheels, or couplings of that railcar type, or textures, etc. which are parts of the assets you selected. As you add more by drag and drop, the list will grow a scroll bar and grow longer as dependencies are identified and added. {{TrainzTip|You should always give the DLH some time to settle before hitting {{kp|Start}}, but once it's cranked the top of your list for a couple of minutes, these days hitting start seems risk free, unlike some of the instabilities CMP used to exhibit as are alluded to in the {{TL|CMP|CMP article}}. CM-2.0 may suffer some of he same issues, but CM-3.3 and after offload much of the data management to TADdaemon.exe which gates data to and from the DLS whilst TrainzUtil.exe manages adds, extractions, and so forth to the database proper; both being invisible in the background save to power users.}}

= Introduction =
This class will be a tour of the Unity Game Engine.  It will cover many topics, mostly just touching the surface.  But there will be plenty of opportunity to dig deeper and learn more by doing. 

This class is an introduction into the Unity Game Engine. Before we can get started creating games, we need to install the necessary software and get our environment set up.

== Overview ==
There are two reasons for this class:
* create cool 3D and 2D games
* learn how to use the Unity Game Engine

For me the second aspect is actually the more important one.  .
 
=== Subchapter ===
If you want a subchapter, this is how it is done...

 
== Installation ==
How to install Unity, supported platforms, etc...
 
 
== Links ==
If you find a cool tutorial or a neat link, post it here for now:

Example of a www link: (http://www.ethority.de/weblog/social-media-prisma/)

 
== How to do referencing? == 
An example usage of a reference is 
:&quot;The Social Web is a set of social relations that link people through the World Wide Web.&quot; 
&lt;ref name=&quot;SocialWeb&quot;&gt;Social web, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_web&lt;/ref&gt;

It has to be distinguished from what is called the Web 2.0 &lt;ref name=&quot;Web20&quot;&gt;Web 2.0, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0&lt;/ref&gt;, a phrase termed by Tim O’Reilly &lt;ref name=&quot;OReilly&quot;&gt;Tim O’Reilly (2005-09-30). &quot;What Is Web 2.0&quot;. O’Reilly Network&lt;/ref&gt;.  Whereas Web 2.0 is about technology, the social web is about people. 

So for instance, the map of the Internet, maps machines: 

[[File:Internet_map_1024.jpg|200px|Machines]]

Whereas, a maps of friends on Facebook (a social network) maps people: 

[[File:Kencf0618FacebookNetwork.jpg|200px|People]]

= Audio and Sound =
Every game needs audio and sounds. Good sound is a crucial part in a successful game.  For this you need to learn to create sound and audio. Also finding free sounds is an important topic.  Some of that information  can be found in the wikibook &lt;ref name=&quot;Game_Creation_with_XNA&quot;&gt;Game Creation with XNA, https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Game_Creation_with_XNA&lt;/ref&gt;.

This is an auto-categorizing template with no other purpose than to save user typing and memory efforts to add a page in up to four Trainz categories. It's primary use is to  list the tagged sub-sub-page into a maintenance category. 
&lt;br&gt;
This template should be used to categorize all sub-sub-Pages of the Trainz wikis; In some contexts (Trainz references for example) it will be conditionally automatically included.
* To suppress the auto-category define the 'inhibit' parameter. 

: It is used by adding the template '''&lt;code&gt;{{tlx|TRS-SubSubPg|[[m:pipetrick|sorting-pipetrick]]}}&lt;/code&gt;''' &lt;br/&gt;to auto-categorize pages to '''&lt;code&gt;[[:category:Trainz Sub-Sub-pages]]&lt;/code&gt;''' adding it alphanumerically sorted (by the pipetrick) to the list of sub-sub-pages located from other such declarations.

: This schema is an administrative aid to making sure pages don't go orphaned, but creates a navigable list sectioned by page titles for the users to navigate.

* Parameters 1, 2, or 3 may be given and will &lt;code&gt;auto:prefix&lt;/code&gt; the word &lt;/code&gt;category: and colon&lt;/code&gt; to auto-form up to three other category links, letting one cut and paste line define up to four categories.

My name's Greg, I live in Stirling (Scotland, UK) where I seem to spend a lot of my time sitting in front of screens jabbing at an array of plastic buttons. When not jabbing, I occasionally field the odd enquiry from clients, colleagues and general ne'er-do-wells. I enjoy my job, my family and my weekends.
 
I encourage students to post messages on my talk page.--[[User:GregXenon01|GregXenon01]] ([[User talk:GregXenon01|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GregXenon01|contribs]]) 15:28, 12 March 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the discussion/talk page for the Digital Media and Culture Yearbook 2014 [[User:GregXenon01|GregXenon01]] ([[User talk:GregXenon01|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GregXenon01|contribs]]) 16:55, 12 March 2014 (UTC)

== Numbers in the page names? ==

Somehow, I doubt the necessity of explicitly numbering the subpages.  What’s the reason of naming the page [[{{SUBJECTPAGENAME}}/Chapter 1: Technological Determinism|Chapter 1: Technological Determinism]] when it could be named simply ''Technological Determinism''?

In general, a wikibook is intended to be updated over the years, and at times, it may become necessary to shuffle the chapters.  Naturally, when the page is named ''Example'', the link to it could be moved around the “Contents” freely.  However, when the pages are named ''Chapter 3: Rat that ate the malt, Chapter 4: Cat that chased the rat,'' etc., inserting a new “Chapter 3” means that all the chapters down the line ''are to be renamed'' (old “Chapter 3” to “Chapter 4”, old “Chapter 4” to “Chapter 5”, and so on.)

Even if it’s not an issue for this particular wikibook, I’d rather stick to this particular convention, just in case.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{status|00%}}{{DISPLAYTITLE:The Java Programming Language}}
{{IB/Group_4/Computer_Science/Object-Oriented_Programming_Languages}}
Java is an object-oriented language with some imperative features. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

== Anatomy of a Java program ==
There are two basic parts to a Java program: (1) instructions to the Java compiler and (2) instructions that describe the processing to be done. However, before we can describe these instructions, we must describe how Java names things; that is, how Java defines identifiers. An identifier is made up of letters, numbers, underscores, and dollar signs, but must begin with a letter or an underscore. Beware: Java is case sensitive. This means that &lt;code&gt;Value&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;VALUE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;vaLue&lt;/code&gt; are four seperate identifiers. In fact, we can construct 32 distinct identifiers from these five letters by vary the capitalisation.

Java programmers use certain conventions to provide visual cues about what an identifier is naming. The language does not require that these conventions be followed, but good programming practice dictates that we should. It is far easier for programmers to understand each other's code when we all follow the same naming conventions. Class identifiers begin with an uppercase letter, object and action (method) identifiers begin with a lowercase letter, and constant identifiers are all uppercase.

=== Program structure ===
Let's examine the following Java program. As we go through this program, the the syntax and semantics of the statements will be pointed out.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
// Program Rhyme prints out a nursery rhyme
public class Rhyme
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		final char SEMI_COLON	= ';';
		final String VERB1	= &quot;went up &quot;;
		final String VERB2	= &quot;down came &quot;;
		final String VERB3	= &quot;washed &quot;;
		final String VERB4	= &quot;out came &quot;;
		final String VERB5	= &quot;dried up &quot;;

		String firstLine;
		String secondLine;
		String thirdLine;
		String fourthLine;

		firstLine		= &quot;The itsy bitsy spider &quot; + VERB1 + &quot;the water spout&quot;;
		secondLine		= VERB2 + &quot;the rain and &quot; + VERB3 + &quot;the spider out&quot;;
		thirdLine		= VERB4 + &quot;the sun and &quot; + VERB5 + &quot;all the rain&quot;;
		fourthLine		= &quot;and the itsy bitsy spider &quot; + VERB1 + &quot;the spout again&quot;;

		System.out.println(firstLine + SEMI_COLON);
		System.out.println(secondLine + SEMI_COLON);
		System.out.println(thirdLine + SEMI_COLON);
		System.out.println();
		System.out.println(fourthLine + &quot;.&quot;);
	}
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Line 1 begins with a double slash (&lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;) and is ignored by the translation system because it is a comment. Comments begin with &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt; and extend to the end of the line. Another way of entering comments into the program is to insert them between &lt;code&gt;/*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;*/&lt;/code&gt;. Comments that begin with &lt;code&gt;/*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;*/&lt;/code&gt; can extend across any number of lines.

Line 2 names the program or application class. In Java programs are called applications or application classes. Many Java systems require that the file name in which the application is stored be the same as the class name with an extension attached. Line 3 is the beginning brace that encloses the class.

Java calls subprograms ''methods''. Every Java application must have a method named &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;. Its heading must look exactly like line 4. For now, do not worry about the details of that line, just copy it exactly when you write programs. Line 5 contains only one character: the left brace (&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;). Like C++, Java uses this character to begin a block and the right brace (&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;) on line 28 to close the block. The ''body of the method'' contains the statements that are translated by the compiler and executed when the program is run.

Line 6 through 11 instruct the compiler to assign the ''named constant'' on the left of the equal sign a place in memory and to store the value on the right of the equal sign in that place. In Java, a named constant is made up of the reserved word &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt; followed by a data type identifier or a class. In this case &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the value to be stored in the constant is one alphanumeric character. &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the value to be stored in the constant is a string of characters. The data type identifier or class name is followed by the name to be given to the constant. An equal sign and the value to be stored there follow the constant name. In line 6, a semicolon is stored in constant &lt;code&gt;SEMI_COLON&lt;/code&gt;. In line 7, the string made up of characters '&lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;', '&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;', '&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;', '&lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;', '&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;' (space), '&lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;', '&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;', and '&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;' (space) is stored in &lt;code&gt;VERB1&lt;/code&gt;. Line 8 through 11 define for more String constants. By convention, most programmers use all uppercase for constant identifiers.

Output of the application Rhyme:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;powershell&quot;&gt;
The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout;
down came the rain and washed the spider out;
out came the sun and dried up all the rain;

and the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Error: Could not load texture==

Sometimes a committed asset will report a missing texture file with a file path referenced in the cache, the cab (database {{TG|J|*.JA file}}) resulting in no texture file in the ''open-for-edit asset folder''. This particular example suggests there are three possible fixes for this particular missing texture, so I'm going to cover them in order from the most difficult (cursorary mention) to possibly the easiest.

== Replace the missing texture by making one==
{{TrainzTip|
: ''It is likely this example is after some early processing using PEV tools on the date of installation. I recollect that but also reason because most TRS2006 assets will not contain texture.txt files if they haven't been massaged to comply with later data standards. This evolution in data types and configurations is the cause of many errors, and we the user community demanding more and better graphics from Trainz are at fault in that!
}}
The first one way this asset might be repaired is to create an appropriate {{TG|T|*.tga (texture file)}} as is referenced in a {{Tref}}.texture.txt Trainz {{TG|I|INI file}}, which are listed in directory folders when opened for edit as {{Tref}}.texture.txt files. This option can range from the trivial (create 'black.tga', often for a shadow texture, a handle, step, or under body) to the very difficult (the texture is the multi-view wrap texture that creates the detailed surface appearance of an 3D asset, meaning it's the most complicated part of any set of textures. In the easy or simple case, one makes a small image file in Microsoft Paint, GIMP, or other such graphics drawing program using a power of two squared size such as 8x8px, 16x16px, 32x32px or the like, keeping in mind Trainz will complain if a texture is monotone, to create a solid color, use the 32x32px size and change a few pixels inside to give it a little imperfection texturing, as if it showed dirt or rust, etc. For a solid black handle, try a dark grey/charcoal for a few pixels 'deliberate imperfection'. Creating a more complicated texture is beyond 'Intermediate Trainz' so the best thing to figure out is when to put things on hold and look into the asset creation pages and consult those with experience before tackling such.

But there is often another recourse, stealing the author's own texture from the author. 
[[File:Trainz error fixes (Error= Could not load texture ') kuid 523 23233 XING 2 US boom-01.png|thumb|center|800px|TRS2006-SP1 content manager and Notepad++ editor showing (Left) both the errors list and asset line, (right) The key portion of the modified confix.txt file with it's new description block, (2nd error, already repaired)]]
Asset creators are human beings and like the rest of us take the shortest way to doing multiple tasks given two or three choices. In the case of the two road crossing assets ('Xing' often in Trainz) here with issues, they are part of a set downloaded not from the DLS (leaving Auran and N3V off the hook, at least from the point of view of not sourcing corrupted data) but sourced from a famous Trainzer community, TrainzProRoutes.com, with an equally good reputation. They were, as might be deduced looking at the install times, ''part of a kit or set of assets bundled together'' in one {{TG|Z|*.zip}} or {{TG|C|*.cdp) file as a group configured (type+region+kind+era+category-region) with the same look and feel, so naturally they tend to share textures. These I have because they were used in a number of period routes set in the early 20th century gotten from the DLS recently authored (sic) by gfisher, again a famed route builder&amp;mdash;which is why they were recommended to me to study and steal from for my projects in the same sort of mileau. Of the four, the entity with the worst reputation is N3V/Auran! 
 
# Step one in reading this error message was to examine a similar asset by the same author. The explicit file was found in 'XING_2_US_315', &lt;kuid:523:23235&gt; which assuming they are a direct copy, makes the fix a matter of opening both for edit, then copying the missing file into the sub-folder where the ini file

==About Category-region codes==
{{Parent|{{TR|R|TBS}}|{{TR|R|config.txt files|p=config}}}}
'''Category-region codes''' are a single (&quot;UK&quot;) or multiple codes (&quot;AU;DE;UK;US&quot;) in a quoted string that is included in the {{TL|config.txt file}} for user defined filters. In this work, this later form is sometimes referred to as a string array&amp;mdash;it's logical effect.
* Assets with narrow single country scope would contain a single code after the tagname. 
* Assets which were widely found in many regions (e.g. ''''Caterpillar D7 bulldozer'''', will list the series of country codes of the region.)
** The codes have only a minor importance in Trainz and are primarily used in Trainz as a sort and selection criteria in user defined filters.
** Some {{TR|K|p=Kind specifications}} will generate an error if the tag is undefined
** These codes do show up under the region column in {{TA|Content Manager}} where they can be included in defining filters one can also use in {{TL|Surveyor}}. This eliminates looking at undesired assets when focuses on developing your routes. 
* For content that exists in multiple areas, when creating new assets, select appropriate codes in {{TA|Content Creator Plus}} (CCP) or hand edit them into the config.txt ini files.
; For example: a locomotive that was available in the United States and Canada would be specified as follows:

 category-region &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &quot;US;CA&quot;
: One that was available in Australia, Canada, the United States and in the United Kingdom would be specified as follows:

 category-region &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &quot;AU;CA;UK;US&quot;

==Tables of codes==
&lt;big&gt;'''The category-region codes below are in alphabetical order by sort criteria.

Legal codes that are recognized by Trainz are as follows:'''&lt;/big&gt;

===by region code order===

= Game 1: Vegan Island =

A castaway on a lonely Island needs to survive til he will be found from Search and Rescue Partys. There are no animals on that Island, so he needs to gather Food, create a campfire, build a shelter and create Tools to hold out until he is found.

== Coding and Design Tipps ==

* Terrain &lt;br&gt;
There is an option to create a massive amount of trees through out the whole terrain, there are some problems coming with it. The tree prefab collision only works with Sphere, Box or Cube collision. When you use Mesh collisions it will not work with the mass trees. That is a bug known.
&lt;br&gt;
* Random GameObject Placement &lt;br&gt;
Easy way to place a random amount of GameObject on the Terrain is to use a invisible object (Cube). That object will then be moved random around the map and with the function &quot;Terrain.activeTerrain.SampleHeight(transform.position);&quot; its possible to get the height of the terrain. Then you just Instantiate the new object on the position of the invisible object with the height you got with the function mentioned above.

= Game 2: Cube Wars =
Cubes vs spheres, its a cruel world out there.
* Game-Idea:
The general idea was to create a towerdefense-like game in which the enemies follow predefined paths from the spawnpoint to the players base. To defend its base the player needs to build towers along the path. The towers have an AI which allows them to automatically aim the first enemy in their range and attack it. By killing an enemy the player earns money which he can invest in new towers. The enemies appear in waves and over time the enemies are getting stronger and the waves larger. The game has no real end, u just have to reach a new highscore.
* Design:
Because of time issues, we decided to build the world only out of geomatric primitives. To create visual difference between enemies and the players models we created the world in a round look and mainly toon-colored in black and white with just some little colorpriorities. The enemies are all colored in blue and have angular geometry. To support the clean look we relinquished the use of any textures and complex lightsimulation.
* Game-Mechanics:
To create the enemypath we used the free asset iTween from the unity assetsstore which is a very simple pathanimationtool. To calculate if an enemy is inside the range of a tower we used some vector3-mathmatics that says which enemy should get attacked. Then the tower creates a new bullet instance to which he adds the current targetobject. Now the bullet follows the enemy until it gets out of towerrange or hits its target. In both cases the bullet gets destroyed and if applicable the enemy receives damage. If the enemies lives reaches zero the enemy dies and the loot gets added to players account.
If an enemy reaches the playerbase it gets destroyed and the player loses one life. If the lifenumber is zero a gameoverscreen appears and you have to restart.
To build a new tower the player needs to enter the buildmode in which the towerbubble that is most centered in screen gets selected(highlighted). By pressing the right button one of the two implemented towers gets build but only if the player has enough money.
The player also can remove the tower in the same way. The towers as well as the enemies differ for example by speed, damage, lives, costs ,loot ... .

= Game 3 : Loui Roui 's Xtreme Curling Championship Simulator 2K14 =
As part of the elective subject &quot; Xbox programming &quot; was the based on the XNA Xtreme simulator game &quot; Loui Roui 's Xtreme Curling Championship Simulator 2K14 &quot; which can be controlled using the QWERTY keyboard as well as with the Xbox controller.

== The idea for the game ==
The basic idea was based on programming a realistic simulation of a curling competition. Intended to increase the fun factor will be deposited with different sounds the game , which should underline the mood.
Furthermore, it was important for us to use a realistic physics. These calculations have been worked out in advance to the collision behavior of two curling stones around this to use in later steps. Both speed and impact angle were being key factors.

To further enhance the game we already agreed we start to incorporate multiple camera angles on the curling field.

[ [File: Ideenfindung.png | thumb | ideas using a mind map ] ]

== Programming ==
As a programming platform, we opt for the XNA Framework 3.1. The required 3D model are modeled in Blender 2.69 , and then incorporated in . Fbx format in the XNA Framework . Since all team members work at different places in the code , the code was using organized by GitHub . The Git Extension program enabled the versioning of the different program versions and organizes the assembly of code changes .

Right at the beginning , a 3D model of a curling stone was created in Blender which is an important part of the game later . Already on the second day of the first week course could progress to the governance of the stone as well as the integration of 3D elements can be achieved.

As the week has been continuously working on the scope of the game and on the actual gameplay . The current program version includes the following features :


=== Realistic behavior of the stone : ===
In order to obtain a realistic behavior of the stone had different criteria are taken into account :

* Speed ​​loss of curling stone
* Collision detection
* Physically correct propagation of two stones in collision
* Power transmission / transfer speed to hit stone

=== Control ===
The stone can be influenced before throwing in three different parameters. Operation is possible both a QWERTY keyboard as well as the Xbox gamepad.

*'' ' Throw - strength ''' , which is controlled using a Powerbar . This may , at the right moment to stop using the spacebar or the &quot;A&quot; button on the Xbox controller . The stone is then cast at this speed.
*'' ' Orientation ''' , the direction in which the stone will be thrown . The direction is controlled by an arrow which may vary by 40 degrees.
*'' ' Stone - position ''' , at the beginning of the match. This can be changed using the Control Pad to right and left .


=== 3D Models ===
To make the game environment act as possible plastically various three-dimensional elements were installed. The following elements were modeled in Blender:
* Curling rock
* ice
* Guidance Arrow
* Curling Arena


=== Gaming experience : ===
In order to improve the game experience for both graphical , acoustic and physical elements was installed .

The player is represented by two home screens welcomes the game studio , so our development team , and the game imagine . On the second , the two said the player has the option either to start the game as well as look up the controller operation.

During the game, the match is accompanied by different sounds depending on the situation . Furthermore, the Xbox gamepad vibrate when a collision between two curling stones.

==== Generating . Fbx files with Blender ====

===== What's .fbx =====
The format . Fbx is actually a format of Autodesk, 3D objects can be saved with the . It is also the format that XNA uses to implentieren to 3D Models . They are stored in binary or ASCII data. In the second case, the objects can be edited in retrospect, even by text editor. Textures are not stored in . Fbx files and must always accompany with the model.

===== How do I create .fbx ======
The create of . Fbx files with Blender is (in itself ) is quite simple. It creates a 3D model and exports it via '' ' File&gt; Export &gt; Autodesk FBX ( . Fbx ) &quot; '' . It is true but some things to consider :

====== Modeling ======
One should note the Modeling as few polygons to produce , since this can lead to performance problems later. Also, one must note that each face has a normal . For example, if one of a cube Deletes an area , the insides are not shown, since this does not offer means normal. Now you can either manually add subsequently normal or passed by &quot; Solidify Modifer &quot; the faces of a certain thickness. This has a second advantage : do you recognize faces from the side , otherwise they sometimes are too narrow and can not be shown .
When texturing you should always use rectangular textures whose height / width (in pixels ) are always powers of 2 . In addition, UV maps should always be used. Since the automatic Texuturier possibilities of Blender are not applied appropriately. The format of the Texutren can use JPGs , PNGs or BMPs , and it often leads to problems with PNGs . You also have to pay attention to the Kompremierverfahren , especially in JPGs , as these can cause problems later. Best to let the standard procedure of Bildbearbeitungsprogammes set .


====== Export ====== 
Before exporting, you should consider some things . You should see where the center of the object is located . This is also the point of reference will be used later for the position. In addition, the dimension in Blender also be used later. However, one must first &quot; use &quot; all translations . For example, if the object is scaled and rotated , these values ​​are indeed changing in Blender , but can cause problems later and confusions in the Positonierung . Therefore you should all translations ( Loc , Rot , Scale) by pressing &quot;Ctrl + A&quot; to apply , so its value is 1.0 .

===== Import =====
In the project you have to take the final . Fbx and the corresponding textures in the content part of the project . Often the path of the texture in the . Fbx must be changed. For this you open the . Fbx with a text editor and change the path to fit in the &quot;Relative File Name&quot; .

===== Use it in the project ===== 
Need to use the model the following steps are executed.

1. Create Variable for the model
 
   Model myModel ;

2. Loading the model ( in the LoadContet ()). In this case, the file is located in Content.Models and is called &quot; theFBX &quot;.

   myModel = new Floor ( Content.Load &lt;Model&gt; ( &quot;Models \ \ theFBX &quot; ) , 0, 0 , 0);

3. Draw the Model.

            // Copy any parent transforms.
            Matrix[] transforms = new Matrix[myModel.Bones.Count];
           myModel.CopyAbsoluteBoneTransformsTo(transforms);

            // Draw the model. A model can have multiple meshes, so loop.
            foreach (ModelMesh mesh in myModel.Meshes)
            {
                // This is where the mesh orientation is set, as well 
                // as our camera and projection.
                foreach (BasicEffect effect in mesh.Effects)
                {
                    effect.EnableDefaultLighting();
                    effect.DirectionalLight0.DiffuseColor = new Vector3(3.0f, 3.0f, 3.0f); //Bright Light
                    effect.DirectionalLight0.SpecularColor = new Vector3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f); //Blue Specular Light
                    effect.World = transforms[mesh.ParentBone.Index] *
                        Matrix.CreateRotationY(myModelRotation) //Sets the Rotation
                        * Matrix.CreateTranslation(myModelPos)  //Sets the Position
                        * Matrix.CreateScale(myModelScale);     //Sets a Scalation
                    effect.View = Matrix.CreateLookAt(cameraPosition, //Sets the Position of the Camera and the Point where it is look
                        cameraLookAt, Vector3.Up);
                    effect.Projection = Matrix.CreatePerspectiveFieldOfView(
                        MathHelper.ToRadians(45.0f), m_aspectRatio,
                        1.0f, 10000.0f);
                }
                // Draw the mesh, using the effects set above.
                mesh.Draw();

==== Input ====
===== Keyboard =====

The class '' Keyboard '' represents in XNA the keyboard. This keyboard enables queries .
By '' '' GetState method of the current status can be queried.

            KeyboardState keyboard state ;
            keyboard state = Keyboard.GetState ();

Often only simple'' if '' loops are needed to perform a certain action by a keyboard shortcut .
For example , an object can be moved by these queries :

            if ( keyboardState.IsKeyDown ( Keys.Left ) )
                        { X.moveLeft (); }

            if ( keyboardState.IsKeyDown ( Keys.Right ) )
                        { X.moveRight );}



===== Gamepad =====
Alternatively, the control on a gamepad is possible (Xbox 360 controller). This is represented by the class '' GamePadState '' .

            GamePadState gamepad state ;

Since up to four controllers can be connected simultaneously, it is necessary to select '' about '' PlayerIndex the respective controller. In this case we choose controller '' One '' .

            gamepad state = GamePad.GetState ( PlayerIndex.One );

For checking the connection, the '' IsConnected '' feature is available .

            gamePadState.IsConnected

If a connection is successfully established , the controller buttons and knobs can be controlled as keystrokes. In the example, the key '' A '' is selected.

            gamePadState.Buttons.A

Was pressed to check if a key is still a comparison necessary. This is indicated by '' '' ButtonState.Pressed possible.

            gamePadState.Buttons.A == ButtonState.Pressed

Since not only keys but also triggers etc. available on the Xbox controller , there are a few other features . To select , for example, the '' dPad '' (left ), the following call is necessary :

            gamePadState.DPad.Left

In parallel, calling the shoulders or other keys is possible. For example:

            gamePadState.Buttons.LeftShoulder
            gamePadState.Buttons.Back

At the Thumbsticks the behavior is a little different. These are bewegungsempflindlich . Depending on which is moved with the intensity and direction of a joystick , different values ​​will be in the form of a vector is returned (value range 0-1 ) .

In addition, a vibration of the controller is possible, in contrast to the keyboard controller. By setting two float values, the two motors can be controlled in the controller , while the intensity can be adjusted. ( Values ​​between 0 and 1). To the vibration of the controller again To be issued is merely setting the values ​​to'' 0.0f , 0.0f '' necessary.

            GamePad.SetVibration ( PlayerIndex.One , 0.3f , 0.3f );




==== Audio effects ====

===== Play audio files =====
To use audio effects in the program, the following using directive is necessary :

            using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Media ;

All sound effects are represented by the class '' Sound Effect '' . To add a sound, a new object of the class is created. In this example, a &quot;hit&quot; for a hit of a curling stone is needed.

            Sound Effect soundHit ;


In the '' '' LoadContent method, all sound effects are loaded. In this case, the sound file in XNA Explorer is located in the Sounds folder of the directory content . '' &quot; 01_Hit &quot; '' here is the file name without the extension (preferably the data format. Wav formats ) .

            soundHit = Content.Load &lt;SoundEffect&gt; ( &quot;Sounds \ \ 01_Hit &quot;);

To be able to play the audio file soundHit now , only the following command is required :

            soundHit.Play ();

===== Play audio files in a loop =====
To play an audio file in a loop is an object of class '' '' SoundEffectInstance necessary.
After setting the boolean value '' True '' at soundHitLoop the file after calling the '' Play'' method is played in a continuous loop .

            SoundEffectInstance soundHitLoop ;
            soundHitLoop = soundHitLoop.CreateInstance ();
            soundHitLoop.IsLooped = true;
            soundHitLoop.Play ();




==== Start Screen / Endscreen ====

Scene Management ===== =====
Normally, a scene management is essential . Due to the already complex code management was, however, no need for a special scene. To provide , however, a start and a Endscreen the players at his disposal , all the necessary multimedia data have been loaded into the game and controlled by keyboard or gamepad input. The fact that the order of objects in C # are crucial in the Draw method , the start screen of all other objects could be placed so as to be directly at the start of the game visible.

===== Start Screen - Animation =====
The animation at the beginning of the game was an original high-resolution GIF animation . Since only during the development of the problem occurred which is not supported by this file format has been resorted to the embedding of a video. After a few failed attempts (problems after the import due to an incorrect video format , a compression wrong or missing audio tracks ) the issue was resolved ultimately by the import into Windows Movie Maker and a subsequent . Wmv export.

For video formats, the class video and video player, as well as the media using directive is necessary.

            using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Media ;

            Video vid ;
            Video Player vidplayer ;

Here is the video a texture assigned , as well as a '' Rectangle '' generated to fit to the screen :

            Texture2D vidTexture ;
            Rectangle vidRectangle ;

Then the vidplayer is initialized :

            vidplayer = new VideoPlayer ();

And then in the'' '' LoadContent method will be loaded (the file name of the video: &quot;Start Screen&quot; ) . This video can then be modified in '' Rectangle '' (X, Y coordinates of the pixel at the top left , width , height).

            vid = Content.Load &lt;Video&gt; ( &quot;Start Screen&quot; );
            vidRectangle = new Rectangle ( GraphicsDevice.Viewport.X , GraphicsDevice.Viewport.Y , GraphicsDevice.Viewport.Width , GraphicsDevice.Viewport.Height );

The following function is the start of the video is now available:

            vidplayer.Play ( vid );

But not only starting, but also other functions such as stopping are possible:
vidplayer.Stop ();

Patrick calf === ===
Philip Lienert === ===

The project my task was to make it all the graphical elements of the game . All graphics were created in Photoshop and then built using the XNA framework to the respective right place in the code. The Start screen includes an animation which was also created in Photoshop , then saved in Premiere Pro with sound and has been incorporated into the game.

The design should thereby be created , especially among modern frame points. Nevertheless, it should not be left to the Extreme - factor except eight . The logo of our development studios should be kept simplicity as possible , so that it can impress as easily as possible . This simplicity was the motto which is why I have created a largely monochrome logo.

A completely different approach to design , I went in the actual design of the game. Here the focus was clearly on an extreme and eye-catching design . The logo should jump directly to the start screen appear Des eye . The reason for this design was that we want to enhance the relatively inconspicuous sport of curling through the design extreme . The Splatterbrushes in the background of the logo are more eye-catching .

Furthermore, I have been looking after the team entry listed above, which will summarize the project in a few words .

The following is an excerpt of the work :

==Introduction==

Technological determinism in its most basic form is the idea that technology has a significant effect on society. The theory presents the idea that technology is the reason for developments in our society, influencing our lives at a number of levels. Determinists believe that technology influences society on different levels; impacting on industry, the way we communicate and even shapes individuals. 

===Overview===

The definition of technological determinism can be regarded as the cultural implications of new media, by bringing into concern the history behind media theory and production and the way these frameworks develop social and cultural structures. With media technologies constantly developing and allowing for instant and convenient communication, theorists have argued that this has influenced social progressions. New media technologies have revolutionized everyday life to an extent where humans are able to create identity through social networking, consume media productions through television, computers and other means and also communicate from a local to a global scale.

By assessing theorists work such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan Marshall McLuhan], who poses the idea that reforming media affects how humans distinguish and value the world around them and the differences between ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ media, we can establish how technology is determined through the shaping and changes of cultural and social formations.

Technological determinism comes in two main variations, best described as hard and soft determinism.

• Hard or strong determinism argues that technology is the foremost or sole reason for the way society is structured and any development in our culture. Technology is seen as the “prime mover in history” (Chandler, 2000).

• Soft or weak determinism is a less extreme argument, more approved of by scholars. It sees technology as more of an enabler for societal change. Rather than viewing technology as the sole or primary reason for anything that happens in society, it takes into account other factors and argues that technology gives us opportunities for development but does not necessarily cause it.

==Context and Origin==

In history, technology is recognised as the ‘prime mover’ and according to technological determinists; it is the sole cause of change within society. With this, technology becomes seen as the most contributing factor when assessing the pattern of social organisation. Continuing from a technological determinist perspective, the argument remains that as technology has grown (from writing and print, to the television and the computer), society has changed alongside it. The most extremist technological determinists see the entire form of society as being determined by technology.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorstein_Veblen Thorstein Veblen] (1857-1929), an American sociologist and economist was believed to have originally coined the term Technical Determinism. His founding views led to a number of theorists expanding on the subject.  

===Karl Marx===
The first elaboration on technological determinism came from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx Karl Marx], who believed that technology and its changes are the main influence on social relations and social order, and that technology forms the base of society (Chandler 2000). His association with determinism comes from statements such as &quot;The Handmill gives you society with the feudal lord: the steam-mill, society with the industrial capitalist&quot;, although some argue that he was not, in fact, an advocate of technological determinism. Marx focusses on theories surrounding economic activity and its role as a productive force. The forces of production are 'technological processes once begun, require forms of organisation or commitments of political resources, regardless of their social desirability or previous social practices…Cultural and social change follows from technology’(Bimber, 1990:7).

===Non Marxist Theorists===
A number of Non-Marxist theorists have adopted a technological determinism stance including [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigfried_Giedion Sigfried Giedion], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Townsend_White,_Jr. Lynn White Jr], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_White Leslie White], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Innis Harold Innis] and most notably, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan Marshall McLuhan]. McLuhan (1911-1980) was the first theorist to recognise the changes related to technological determinism and how it would bring about a brand new society that was defined by networking and a greater connectivity.

==Main Concepts==

===Technological Imperative===


Technological imperative, also known as the inevitability thesis,  is the assumption that technology cannot be stopped in its development, and that technological progress is irreversible, unavoidable, and inevitable. Essentially, this theory assumes that because we are able to do something because of a particular technology, we ought to, must, or will do it. It is the theory that what can be done, will be done, whether or not it is moral, good, or productive for mankind. 

This is important to technological determinism as it recognizes the influence of technology on action. It drives society to act on not only what they are able to do, but also push the boundaries and test limits because, as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann John von Neumann] observed, man cannot resist the technological possibilities as they arise (Mumford 1971: 186). Progress must continue wherever progress is possible. With this, the theory acknowledges the shift from technology as a means to technology as an end. Critics of the theory, including [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Ellul Jacques Ellul] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Illich Ivan Illich], argue that the theory of technological imperative cannot be fully accurate, as not all areas of available progress are being exploited. The main argument stems from the lack of drive to create renewable energy sources.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Arnold Pacey suggests that the technological imperative is commonly taken to be 'the lure of always pushing toward the greatest feat of technical performance or complexity which is currently available' (Pacey 1983, p. 79). The mathematician John von Neumann wrote with some alarm that 'technological possibilities are irresistible to man.' (in Mumford 1971, p. 186). [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Soustelle Jacques Soustelle] declared of the atomic bomb that 'Since it was possible, it was necessary' (in Ellul 1964, p. 99). And fatalists might add that since we can now destroy the planet, in time we will. The technological imperative is a common assumption amongst commentators on 'new technologies'. They tell us, for instance, that the 'information technology revolution' is inevitably on its way and our task as users is to learn to cope with it&quot; (Chandler 2000).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to McLuhan, the media dictates the message - an argument that becomes extremely relevant when according to technological imperative, society is unable to resist the development of technology and so also the continual development of media platforms.

===Social Media Influence===
====Always-On====
The concept of Always-On stems from the idea that society is now &quot;tethered&quot; to technology, and that humans are always networked and connected in some way, even if they are not physically on any devices. This relates to technological determinism as the theory proposes that society and social relations are determined by technology, and thus also our on-line relationships and cultural tendencies.

Technological determinism underpins the theory of an ‘Always-on Culture’, arguing that social networking platforms have revolutionised the way society communicates.  It creates a new platform of communication, exclusive of face to face interaction. It can be a means to strengthen real life relationships or make solely online ones. It allows for communication in different social circles at the same time and with people across the globe. This, according to technological determinism has shaped the way people communicate within society. 

[[../Chapter 3: Always-on Culture/]].

===On-Line Identity===

Technological determinists would also argue that technology has an impact on our on-line identity, as the specifications of the medium help to dictate what kind of identity we are able to create. In a sense, technology creates parameters into which we must fit our identity - be it through profile pictures, privacy settings, status updates and even friends lists. With the development and increased popularity of social networking platforms, 'online identity' has become an increasingly prevalent area of discussion. These social media sites have created a new online community with sometimes different cultural tendencies to the 'real world'. People are given the opportunity to present an image of themselves to society via the 'virtual world' which may or may not align with their 'real world' identity. According to technological determinism, social media has created a platform for society to create separate identities in the 'virtual world' and thus give people multiple personas who could not have without the aid of this technology. 

[[../Chapter 2: Online Identity/]].

===Science, History and Technology===

Technology has revolutionised throughout history with the adaptation of science. There is a distinct view that technology is applied to science; science creates new explanations, models and predictions about the world which is then applied to practice with technological innovation. Throughout history science has reflected its theories into technology thus forming an in sync correspondence between changes within technology and changes within the world. 

New science comes from old science; new technology from old, from recent developments in media technologies such as mobile phones, the internet, wireless computers such as iPads and laptops and special effects these have resulted in the modification of older technology by improving electronic devices and battery power (Collins &amp; Evans, 2006:10). 

====Gutenberg's Printing Press====
According to McLuhan's theory, the printing press is an example of how technology can change society. The printing press increased the speed of production for the written word, which in turn allowed the reproduction of the written word. This lead to the standardisation of vernacular languages and universal literacy. Thus, the experience of the world is transformed by the standardization of a common language, through the development of a new technology.

==Notable Determinists==
===Marshall McLuhan===
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan Marshall McLuhan]'s work is often viewed as a founding part of the study of media theory, and is often seen as a key component in technological determinism.

=====Extensions of the Human Body=====
This is the assertion by McLuhan that technology are tools that extend the human body and more accurately, extend or amplify the abilities of the visual and aural senses. Examples of this would be the television extending the visual senses or the telephone extending the aural (Brey,2000). McLuhan goes on to say that technology in fact changes the way we act in society and that nowadays people “wears its brain outside its skull and its nerves outside its hide” (McLuhan, 1966 p.64). Although at first this may seem an obscure and nonsensical view, it can be comprehended in that much of the technology we use for interacting and viewing the world start at our fingertips and with the technology that we consume.

McLuhan’s assertion that the medium is the message is perhaps now becoming a more likely theory than was first thought. He asserted that technology is like a bodily extension just like the  “wheel is an extension of the foot” and “a hammer is an extension of the arm” (Lister et al, 2003: p.78) and the recent announcements by Google, Intel, and Facebook that they were all investing heavily in wearable technology is testimony to McLuhan’s theory (BBC, 2014a). Facebook recently bought virtual reality technology firm Oculus VR for £1.2bn and Mark Zuckerberg claimed that “virtual reality will be the next social communications platform” (The Guardian, 2014). Furthermore, his statement that this wearable technology could “change the way we work, play and communicate” (BBC, 2014b) directly supports McLuhan’s stance.

=====The Global Village=====
This is a term coined by McLuhan in reference to what he calls the Electronic culture that arises with the increased use of televisions and computers. A way of understanding this is that the improvement in technology has allowed for much quicker communication. In theory this allows for the entire world to be compressed into a Global Village where everyone can quickly communicate with each other, whereas in practice this has manifested itself through the internet allowing for an individual to have a much larger number of  near constant social connections. A very recent example of this would be the case of popular social media site Facebook in which an average adult user is said to have 338 friends, which clearly shows the breaking down of distance and ease of communication that McLuhan conveys in his idea of the global village(Singha, 2014). This can be also be further established by looking at the number of people that use the most common social networking sites, 1.23 billion monthly active users on Facebook and over 1 billion unique YouTube user visits per month. This puts people in potential contact with more people than they could meet or speak to in their lifetime and again strengthens the idea of the global village. Another idea of this is that through the quick access and speed of response that comes with this type of technology we are able to react to global issues far faster than previously. Therefore, issues that may have once not have been of concern can be addressed by a much bigger crowd. This follows the same underlying concept of increasing technology reducing distances and effectively making the world a smaller more accessible place. McLuhan also suggests that the people who live in this electronic culture, or global village gain all the benefits and downfalls of new technologies and so whereas distances are no longer a problem for communication, technology barriers and development or lack of it can still provide issues (Smith,M and Marx,L. 1994).

=====Hot and Cool Media=====
A way in which Mcluhan categorises different forms of media is through a temperature type scale in which there are both hot and cool types of media. As with much of McLuhan's writings this is not an initially intuitive process. A media type is considered hot if it heavily utilises and immerses one sense in particular. An example of this may be the comparison of a photograph which gives a large and detailed amount of visual information and hence a hot media form, to a sketched cartoon which gives a minimal amount of information visually (Van Koten, 2009). Furthermore McLuhan suggests that it is cool media that involves a higher amount of interpretation from the consumer than hotter forms of media. This can again be thought of as a photo presenting visual information more clearly where as a drawing may need to be interpreted in terms of shapes and colours and a have a meaning which may be more contentious drawn less easily from this information. Below is a table which contrast various types of hot media with their cooler media counterparts (Van Koten, 2009). There is a large amount of contention about the usefulness of the hot and cool media scale due a number of issues that are described in the [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Digital_Media_and_Culture_Yearbook_2014/Chapter_1:_Technological_Determinism&amp;stable=0#Problems_with_Hot_and_Cool_Media Criticism] section below.

Similar to McLuhan’s idea of hot and cool media is the notion of 'light on' and 'light through' media. ‘Light on’ media is where the light source bounces off a surface or object before hitting the viewers’ eyes. Therefore the light is projected onto a screen (Van Koten, 2009). ‘Light through’ media is where the light source is positioned in front of audience; therefore making the audience the screen by projecting light onto them (Van Koten, 2009). In likeness to hot and cool media, ‘light on’ would be described as hot because it is “all revealing” where ‘light through’ is less revealing, more “mysterious” so therefore cool (Van Koten, 2009, p.91). An example of ‘light on’ media is cinema, where the light comes from behind the audience onto the screen, with no chance of participation; where an example of ‘light through’ media is television with the light projecting from the TV onto the viewers, giving more room for interpretation and interaction.

===Ray Kurzweil===


[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil Ray Kurzweil], a futurist specified in speech recognition technology and the future of technology such as robotics and biotechnology, is notable as a technological determinist with his assessment of the history of technology and its rate of progress. 

By establishing technology as a determinist force he states that ‘once life takes hold on a planet, we can consider the emergence of technology is inevitable' (Kurzweil, 1999:30). Kurzweil assumes that the rate of progress of technology is at such a high speed that technological intelligence will surpass human intelligence within a few decades (Kurzweil, 2004:382). He argues that the future holds technological change so fast human nature will take longer to adapt to these changes and the rapid pace of innovation.

Kurzweil explains that technology is a means of evolution, in that ‘technology picks right up with the exponentially quickening pace of evolution’(Kurzweil, 1999:30). Technology has a positive effect on human individuals and society as it allows them to change themselves by bettering their cognitive abilities and health by adapting to technological advancements. For Kurzweil, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth exponential growth] is the leading factor in technology where [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law Moore’s Law] is of strong importance.

==Criticism and Debate==

Technology through significant media forces has reshaped the way in which humans behave, the structure of human societies and even language. Media even has the power to change governments (Collins &amp; Evans, 2006:50). Theorists have formed contradictory ideas that raise debates over the development of technology as being a direct source of social change.

===Cultural Determinism===

Cultural determinism is the idea that the society and culture surrounding us helps determine who we are. Essentially, the environment has more of an influence on something than inherited traits. This opposes the idea of technological determinism as it then assumes that society is not influenced by technology, but rather that society influences technology to fulfill its needs and social tendencies that already exist. The main cultural determinist is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Williams Raymond Williams].

====Raymond Williams====

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Williams Raymond Williams] ‘insists that the future of our media will depend on our capacity to make informed judgements and decisions about that future.’ Our world, society and history are continually altered by whatever new technology comes along: the steam engine, the automobile, the atomic bomb. (Williams, 2003:1). Technology such as television is often argued that it has effects on social behaviour and cultural and psychological conditions. However these effects are the result of the technology being the cause. The notions of a cause and effect between a technology and society, a technology and a culture and a technology and a psychology are quite complex to apply answers and theories to. Williams, however goes on to analyse specifically television as a technology that results in cultural pattern shifts. Williams states that television has altered our world. In this sense it has been created ‘as a result of scientific and technical research’ yet television has been used in many other forms, these are simply the effects of its creation:


• As a tool for social communication to construct social relationships.

• It provides us with certain perceptions of reality within the world

• It provides a strong mode of communication through news and entertainment

• Through television advertising is made possible to promote goods to society

• It follows a set of systems to what society wants from television by attending to opinions and styles of behaviour from what is produced.


Arguably the development of television and overall technology cannot be assumed to purposefully direct society into conforming to change. Technology should be considered as a typical invention of which is accidental in its proceedings (Williams, 2003:5). Television is therefore a technology which without it humans would still have been influenced or entertained by other means. 

Technological Determinism is only one force among others; 'social forces shape technology and technology shapes society, and societies can, and frequently do, make rules that determine which technologies are used and what use can be made of them' (Collins &amp; Evans, 2007:51).

There is an argument concerning whether determinism is in-fact too determined. This theory suggests that determinism that is seen to focus on technology to recognise how we act or think can ignore how we in-fact reach this point. Ong (1982) understands that writing has transformed us, however we are gradually holding less and less control over this. Ong (1982:77) presents ideas about writing and how writing has transformed human consciousness. Ong (1982) takes this further and states that as a result this gives this form of technology a sense of autonomy. This leads to the belief that it is difficult to understand the possible social changes that have to occur in technology as it acts on its own to decipher which caused or resulted in the other to occur. 
 
Further criticism of Technological Determinism is found in the idea that the theory is written in a broad sense. McLuhan also fails to mention how technologies are constructed yet implicitly speaks of the way in which humans interact with technology. McLuhan also fails to acknowledge the idea of ‘technological innovation’ this is despite the fact that this technologies are created through the human interplay with various technologies that McLuhan holds in high regard (Cana 2003).

===Problems with McLuhan's &quot;the medium is the message&quot;===
It could be argued that it is more beneficial to state that &quot;the medium is also the message&quot; as opposed to &quot;the medium is the message&quot;. This is believed because the nature of the medium in itself is informative and it is hard to claim that the content is independent of the medium. It is difficult to suggest that the content is not shaped by the medium. Also, content that is generated by technology such as language, print, TV and internet justify it's usability and this content can also work to fuel new technological innovations (Cana 2003).

===Problems with Hot and Cool Media===
As McLuhan has the tendency of doing in his writing, the Hot and Cool media temperature scale comes with a number of criticisms due to the somewhat vague nature in which it is described. Firstly, there is no actual way of measuring the temperature of a media form and so no way of being able to determine if one type of media is hotter or cooler than another. This means that it is a subjective scale and that any consensus comes down to the opinions of the people using it, therefore leaving it prone to bias and making it somewhat less useful. To add to this, the scale can only be used when comparing two media forms that have somewhat similar aims or place emphasis on the same senses such as the radio and telephone(Van Koten, 2009). As much of McLuhan's work is not particularly recent it also does not include or take into consideration many recent updates in technology. Examples of this would be the improvement of televisions with high definition capabilities and video calling technology available commonly on smart phones. Therefore it can in many cases be discarded as a flawed method of gauging media.

==Glossary==

'''Cool Media''': is known to be of low definition, this is so because the level of information being given to the reader is small. In comparison to hot media, cool media requires greater levels of participation from audiences. Examples of cool media include: telephones, cartoons, television. 

'''Culture''': the totality of socially transmitted behavior patterns, arts, beliefs, institutions, and all other products of human work and thought.

'''Hot Media''': is described as something that is of ‘high definition’ and are low in participation as they do not require much assistance from audiences to be filled or completed. The idea of high definition photographs can be used to this extent. Other examples of hot media include: radio, print and movies.

'''non-Marxist''': a non-Marxist can be defined as a socialist who disagrees with the idea of communism and works towards and wishes for a society to exist where the workers within society have the over-riding say in their lives.

'''Social Media''': is the various websites and applications that allow for users to communicate and share experiences to the public and in private, allowing for them to participate in social networking.

'''Technology''': in broad terms, technology is an entity used to solve real-world problems

'''Technological Innovation''': has been described as the innovation of a new product that provides substanstial improvements on previous products. Technological innovation is crucial to the success of products and they can be protected by Intellectual Property.

'''The medium is in the message''': this is an idea of Marshall McLuhan and he suggests that the medium form in a way embeds itself into the message. The result is that messages are influenced through the medium.

==Introduction==

The internet was not originally built as a “personal communication medium, let alone a way for fans to connect around their objects of pleasure, for people to find potential romantic partners, for employers to find or investigate potential hires, or any such social process. It was developed to safeguard military knowledge.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Baym, N. (2010). ''Personal Connections in the Digital Age: Digital Media and Society Series'', (pp.13). Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term online identity has obvious connotations of the profiles people hold on social networking sites such as Facebook. However, the realms of online identity are not isolated to and focused purely on social networking sites, and include a plethora of online sites that provide an outlet for expression and representation of identity online.

Thinking about online identity and how we use it, and how it consequently uses us, allows for thought on a range of topics including: how social media technologies help mobilize our identities; the way we communicate with each other; how the narratives we construct through our online identities relate to our culture; how we present ourselves to others in the social media world; and the nature of production and consumption of digital representations. 

Online identity is argued by many theorists and critics as being another outlet for the expression of identity, and a fair amount of focus is granted to the modification process that accompanies it. It is a contentious issue as to whether our actual identities align with our online identities or whether it is more complicated than this, and this too is explored by theorists in order to try and obtain a greater understanding of the broad spectrum that is online identity.

==Main Concepts==

==Forms of Digital Representation==
===Narrative===

Understanding narrative is vital in understanding the impact online identity can and does have on the individual and the 21st century.  Narrative in this context needs to be described in a much more critical sense than just 'narrative has something to do with stories'. Whilst it does involve the process of storytelling and description, narrative is a very old form of communication that is powerful; it can work in simple forms or on a sophisticated level. It is not the same sort of storytelling found in literature as it is independent from fiction. It exists in the real world and is how we make sense of our lives and the world around us. Putting and displaying our narratives online preserves it, makes it more real and helps us feel more human by providing us with proof. Facebook statuses, pictures and albums are a prime example of this. Narrative is independent of ‘tellability’: you can tell a story, but narrative has a psychological component as it involves the listener’s or observer’s participation in ‘filling in the gaps’ of the story.  These gaps can be the back story, intertextual references, characterisation and even generic familiarity. Narrative and realism are dominant in the production of digital representations.

Van Koten argues that narrative and realism are dominant forms of digital representation in terms of production.&lt;ref&gt;Van Koten, H. (2009). The Digital Image and the Pleasure Principle: The Consumption of Realism in the Age of Simulation. In Bentkowska-Kafel (Eds.), ''Digital Visual Culture: theory and practice'', (pp.89). Bristol: Intellect&lt;/ref&gt; Online identity is so closely linked to (and in essence is) a form of self expression. Essentially, creating an identity for oneself online and presenting ones narrative to the world is one of the ways in which we create platforms for ourselves. This platform has allowed for self-expression of the identity we want to have and want to present to the world.


===Behaviours and Narrative on Facebook===

Facebook is something that might be used by almost the entire world, but how we use our individual page is a different matter. Facebook is a place where narrative exists as people post about their lives through photographs, status updates and events. In fact, Facebook has even evolved to give people their own timelines, and one can look back over their story to see how their existence has developed and how it has been documented and shared on Facebook. 

A book my Gemini Adams looks at the idea of how people view Facebook posts in different ways &lt;ref&gt;Adams, G. (2013) “Facebook Diet, The : 50 Funny Signs of Facebook Addiction and Ways to Unplug With a Digital Detox (The Unplug Series)'', (pp.1-146). London: Live Consciously&lt;/ref&gt;  Adams suggests that there are two forms of Facebook narrators; the ones who put everything on, and the ones who are more selective about their posts:
For example some people use Facebook to talk about everything such as:
What they eat
What film they are watching
If they’re happy or sad
If they’re enjoying a lecture or falling asleep
Who they are angry with 
The fact they are frustrated walking in the rain or waiting for a bus
All the photos from nights out whether they are of quality or not
This may not seem like an issue and Adams notes that these, “superficial,” details are not very harmful. However, it is believed that some people have a very different approach to Facebook and see it as an almost sacred space to be used only for important or useful updates such as:
I’m getting married
What is the best way to cook a chicken?
I passed my exams
Can anybody suggest the best taxi firm in the area?
I’m buying a house
I went on holiday, here are my pictures
I’m getting a new job

Therefore, Adams shows that the subjects of narration on Facebook differ depending on the school or “sharing levels,” that a person belongs to. 

However, the book also points out that the detail of the given narration is also dependent on how people view Facebook as a forum for publicising information. For example, some people may announce on Facebook that they are pregnant without telling friends or family first. Some argue that this is natural as Facebook is now a normal and common form of communication. However, others are concerned that Facebook has forced a loss in the intimacy of communication and eradicated the need for making the effort to contact people. It is also suggested that some events in a person’s life are personal and it is inappropriate to share it with the large group of, “random acquaintances,” that make up a large percentage of people’s Facebook friend group.

Overall the book raises the idea that Facebook is a site of narration, but users adopt it in different ways and choose to share their stories in a mixture of styles which raises controversial questions and theories on communicative behaviour.

===Narratives and Online Chat Rooms===



Online chat rooms are a place where people can open up and develop their true character due to the freedom of anonymity. However, because in a chat room one speaks to a stranger who one may never meet or come across again, there is an extreme temptation to create a false narrative for the sake of: fun, experiment, emotional liberation or exploitation.

A book by Dr Monica T. Whitty and Dr Adiran N. Carr which looks at romances online explains that people are restricted in real life by the baggage of reality that they find oppressing or problematic. &lt;ref&gt;Whitty, T and Carr, A (2006) “Cyberspace Romance: The Psychology of Online Relationships '', (pp.45-53). England: Palgrave Macmillian&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, using teenage subjects in a chat room setting, Lynn Schofield Clark observed the way they acted towards strangers online and concluded that chat rooms are often used only for &quot;fun&quot; and not the pursuit of serious relationships; the attraction of this being the lack of consequences within their cyberspace narrative. &lt;ref&gt;Jones, S G (ed) (1998) &quot;Cybersociety 2.0: Revisiting Computer-Mediated Communication and Community&quot;, (pp.159-182). London: SAGE Publications, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Internet chat rooms offer an escape from this as users have the opportunity to invent new lives, new back stories and to rid themselves of unwelcome details which they wish they could remove in reality. 

It is questionable as to whether this is a positive or negative ability as there are both advantages and disadvantages to it. One could say that having the freedom to have an invented narrative could allow one to express themselves and explore emotions or ideas that seem impossible in ordinary life. It may reduce the likelihood of mental illness as a person has a forum to be experimental and play out confusing issues. However, it is also arguable that this stops people living in reality and dealing with their lives in an active and healthy manner. False narratives encourage deception and also allow for people to exploit and harm vulnerable others through the use of abusive manipulation and emotive stories.

Regardless of the ethical arguments, it is evidential through exploring studies on online chat rooms, or even through personal use, that they do provide users with the chance to either voice their own genuine narratives without fear of being known. But chat rooms also let people invent new or fabricated narratives which can potentially be beneficial to their own development, or indeed harmful to themselves and to others.

==Impression Management==

Online presentation of the self is an expression of identity, but also a careful management process, through visual representation, that seeks to modify the impression that others have about our personalities

The World Wide Web gives users the ability to present various forms of the self to others at a distance. With the presence of an online identity that has the potential to be distributed and viewed across the globe, how you are presented and judged can become a major issue for many people. This can affect self-confidence and may lead to some people manipulating real-life events prior to making a record of them available online (through editing of photos, posts, etc), but also the ability to keep elements of your life separate; e.g. professional and social life, how you present yourself to family and how you present yourself to friends, and the expectations that come with the aforementioned. Thus, impression management could be said to be the act of selectively presenting and hiding sides of one’s own identity.

Due to the increasing likelihood of one's online identity affecting real-life events and circumstances, Impression Management is arguably more important now than it has ever been. The vast majority of executive companies have been using search engines to perform background checks on applicants and potential employees since 2006.&lt;ref&gt; Cristian Lupsa (November 29, 2006). &quot;Do you need a Web publicist?&quot;. The Christian Science Monitor.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years later, not only has that percentage risen, but employers are twice as likely to eliminate a potential candidate for a position due to negative information found online. Additionally, over one quarter of executives placed into positions by search firms in 2012 were initially contacted or identified on a social network, meaning not only must potential applicants remain increasingly vigilant, for possible negative aspects of their online identity, but must also proactively work toward presenting oneself as being employable. &lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Robyn. 2013 Executive Job Market Intelligence Report. Rep. Execunet, 2013. http://www.execunet.com/promo/pdf/ExecuNet_Executive_Job_Market_Intelligence_Report_2013.pdf. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Anonymity===

=====Disembodiment effect=====

The disembodiment effect regards the agency of online users, able to interact and communicate online, exceeding the limitations of their physical bodies. The digital environment seems to disregard the idea of a connection between one’s self and one’s body. Users are able to use make use of language, avatars, pictures, amongst other social cues, and use SNS’s to manipulate their various social cues and affordances to create disembodied online entities which can operate in ways perhaps different from how they would act socially in person. Where anonymity is an affordance of a particular SNS, users are capable of behaving either in accordance or against the norms of their social behaviour. Some can behave maliciously and deviate from their usual civilised, socialised behaviour under the allowance of anonymity.

====Disinhibition Effect====

The disinhibition effect, where online users shed their real time social inhibitions in their anonymous, invisible online identity, is thought to be broken down into 6 explanatory factors: dissociative anonymity, invisibility, asynchronicity, solipsistic introjection dissociative, and minimization of authority. Disinhibition is usually categorised as either Benign or Toxic, the former referring to the way in which people can often act nicer than they do in face-to-face situations and the latter describing the way in which people can rally against socially-accepted moral norms and explore darker domains.  

======'''Dissociative anonymity'''======
Where usernames and email addresses are the main information we have of one another as users, people can remain relatively anonymous online: some having fake names, and others having no names. In representing such a limited amount of data about one’s self we are able to operate without accountability. By dissociating one’s online actions from one’s self and real identity, people are less hesitant to vocalize any thoughts or opinions they have, and self-disclose freely. One can avoid assuming ownership of their online actions, and can even convince themselves that such behavior is separate from them and “not me at all.” &lt;ref&gt; Suler, J., The Online Disinhibition Effect, Vol 7, no. 3, Mary Ann Liebert, Available at: http://www.samblackman.org/Articles/Suler.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;

======'''Invisibility'''======
Being not physically present or seen when interacting online can add to the disinhibition effect in that one has the ability, and capacity, to roam through and view data in various different online areas; chat rooms and online interactions. Although we can understand a lot about a user’s identity through our online interaction with them and their self-disclosure, we still cannot physically see them. &lt;ref&gt; Suler, J., The Online Disinhibition Effect, Vol 7, no. 3, Mary Ann Liebert, Available at: http://www.samblackman.org/Articles/Suler.pdf
 &lt;/ref&gt; By eradicating the physical social cues present in physical interaction, such as facial expressions and reactions to an unsettling statement, or how one looks when uttering a controversial aside, this ultimately can eradicate one’s regard for how such a statement makes them look or how it is received by others. &lt;ref&gt; Baym, N. (2010). Personal Connections in the Digital Age: Digital Media and Society Series. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately this invisibility can effect how we portray ourselves, and how we interact with others in such a disinhibited mode of behavior.

======'''Asynchronicity'''======
Interacting online, we do not have to communicate in real time – we can wait hours, days or even weeks before responding to one another – whereas in real time interactions we need to deal with others’ immediate reactions to what we say and do. Having to consider others in our real time actions inhibits us to conform to social norms and respond with social regard for the other person. When these social cues are lifted in the anonymous, invisible online realm, we can bide our time and allow ourselves to develop our thought processes and opinions, giving rise to structured and articulate responses benign and toxic disinhibition that avert social norms.
 
======'''Solipsistic introjection''' ======
Through not interacting face to face, online interactivity between users can blur boundaries of the self. People can feel connected psychically with the thought processes and messages of the user they are speaking to, as they are devising a voice and image of that user speaking inside their own mind, and introducing the other’s thought process and ‘voice’ into their own psyche. The online user then becomes one’s companion inside one’s inner psychological world, where one can entertain continuations of online conversations and say things they perhaps would not say in person. In reading a companion’s messages online listening to the voice constructed for them inside one’s head, one may hear one’s own voice and take what their companion is saying as their own voice speaking to their self. In hearing one’s own voice when interacting with another user online, as if having a conversation with one’s self, one is likely to be disinhibited and say whatever comes to mind - as speaking to one’s self inside one’s own head feels perfectly safe. &lt;ref&gt; Suler, J., The Online Disinhibition Effect, Vol 7, no. 3, Mary Ann Liebert, Available at: http://www.samblackman.org/Articles/Suler.pdf
 &lt;/ref&gt;

======'''Dissociative imagination'''======
One may come to believe that the characters created for other online users inside their own head, along with their idea of their own online self, live in a different spatial dimension; an online dimension. In supposing that these online components live in a separate space, one may separate online activity and behavior from offline accountability. It can be argued that some treat the Internet and the online realm as a game in which the usual rules of social interaction do not apply, and another set of governing maxims of acceptable behavior reign. &lt;ref&gt; Suler, J., The Online Disinhibition Effect, Vol 7, no. 3, Mary Ann Liebert, Available at: http://www.samblackman.org/Articles/Suler.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in something of a legal grey area, evident in the fact that sentences and articles that would be considered libellous if published in a newspaper or magazine can be delivered to international readers through websites and blogs with little controversy most of the time. In South Korea forty per cent of the population play the game ''Lineage'', and the city of Seoul even has its own ‘cyber crime unit’ which reports at least one hundred real life attacks a month that result from game world interactions alone.&lt;ref&gt;Lister ''et al''. ''New Media: A cultural Introduction'', (2009), (pp.211). Oxen: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

======'''Minimization of authority'''======
One’s offline authority is coded and communicated through various social cues such as modes of dress, body language and position within society in everyday society. Without these social cues of the physical world, one’s authority can be dramatically diminished online in the realm where users feel equally capable and entitled to express their views. Anonymity enables a type of freedom, and this freedom can have obvious personal benefits if the material being generated, shown or shared is transgressive.&lt;ref&gt; Davidson, P. ''The Social Media Reader'', (2012). (pp.132). New York: New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Where fear of punishment may govern someone’s decision to speak their mind in person, these limitations can disappear online where people feel free to disclose the beliefs of their elevated, entitled online identity. As the online realm depends on articulation of text, not necessarily immediately in response to a user but whenever one feels to do so, those who can manipulate language in a sophisticated manner can elevate their own status and authority online by seeming of superior intellect. In this the lines of authority can be blurred online. &lt;ref&gt; Suler, J., The Online Disinhibition Effect, Vol 7, no. 3, Mary Ann Liebert, Available at: http://www.samblackman.org/Articles/Suler.pdf
 &lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyberbullying====

Since the beginning of Social Media, there have been issues with cyberbullying or ‘trolling’ as its also known. The severity of this form of bullying can range from flippant remarks to organised acts of violence and invasion of privacy. Whereas most bullying targets people based on gender, sexuality, race, or class, the ease with which comments can be sent has led to people of all types being subject to online intimidation. Most often, people create new online identities just for the purpose of cyberbullying.  Cyberbullying means sending or posting harmful material or engaging in other forms of social aggression using the Internet or other digital technologies &lt;ref&gt;Willard, Nancy. (2007). ''Cyberbullying and Cyberthreats'' (Champaign: Research Press). &lt;/ref&gt; . This can be done by a single bully or multiple ones, and primarily takes place on social networking sites. It’s also common for people to create fake profiles on online dating sites and to pretend to be someone they’re not, which is referred to as ‘catfishing’. 

Cyberbullying can sometimes be worse than real life bullying, since the bullies usually hide behind the mask of anonymity offered by false online identities. The ability for individuals to cover up their digital trail by using alternate accounts under different guises, often with other IP addresses or personal information other than their own, makes it hard to estimate exactly how much a person can be held accountable for. Furthermore, because of the lack of face-to-face contact, the bully might not know the effects their bullying might have on the victim and thus are unable to realise the gravity of their actions &lt;ref&gt; Storm, Paris &amp; Storm, Robert (2006) ''Adolescents: A Preliminary Assessment'' in ''The Educational Forum'' vol. 70 no. 1 pp. 21-36&lt;/ref&gt;.  Anonymous bulling might have serious consequences. There have been numerous cases in which the victim has even committed suicide as a result of the torment they have faced from an anonymous source. Especially with teenagers, cyberbullying is hard to prevent since the victims usually don’t alert family to the fact that they’re being bullied out of fear that their parents might take extreme precautions to prevent further incidents, such as confiscating their computers and mobile phones &lt;ref&gt; Storm, Paris &amp; Storm, Robert (2006) ''Adolescents: A
Preliminary Assessment'' in ''The Educational Forum'' vol. 70 no. 1 pp. 21-36&lt;/ref&gt;.

One of the most tragic examples of cyberbullying was the case of 13-year old Megan Meier from Missouri. In 2006, Megan started talking to a teenage boy who introduced himself as “Josh Evans“ on the social networking site MySpace. After a few weeks of being in an online relationship the nature of their communication abruptly changed with Josh starting to make insulting comments. Eventually, their correspondence resulted in Megan’s suicide. Months later the true identity of Josh was revealed as being set up by a friend of Megan’s as well as her mother Lori Drew and her colleague Ashley Grills. The federal district court convicting Drew of a misdemeanor violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). The case of Megan Meier pushed forward legislation for the criminalization of cyberbullying. &lt;ref&gt; Ruedy, Matthew C. (2008) &quot;Repercussions of a myspace teen suicide: Should anti-cyberbullying laws be created.&quot;' North Carolina Journal of Law &amp; Technology vol. 9 no. 2 pp. 323&lt;/ref&gt;. The recording of conversations and comments made through social media has been deemed draconian, yet a positive aspect of it is that it can be utilised in cyberbullying investigations to find out the perpetrators of online harassment.

====Online Presence of Catfish====

The term &lt;I&gt;Catfish&lt;/I&gt; has been used to describe someone who is not truthful about their real identity and acts behind an online masquerade, typically in a quest for romance or deception. Identity is hidden by concealing personal details such as appearance, for example through the use of photographs of a different person to represent the self. The popularity of the term was due to the success of &quot;reality thriller&quot; and documentary film [[w:Catfish_(film)|Catfish]], which charted the search for one man's online lover in reality. Fundamentally the show highlighted how easy it is to lie about your true identity via social networking sites, although Catfish mainly focused on the presence of Catfish on Facebook.

====Multiplicity====

Just as one has various roles and identities in everyday life – mother, employer, daughter, sister – so too, one has the flexibility to create multiple roles for themselves online. As social beings adapt their approach to suit whom and what they are interacting with in life, this is also true for the identities we construct of ourselves online, depending on the context in which we are interacting.  We can take our overall self and extract various attributes of ourselves to exaggerate and base an entire identity around – and since we are all more than one attribute we can fashion various versions of ourselves across various outlets within the digital environment.
One can create multiple identities online depending on the medium they are using i.e. a ‘fun loving, youthful and inspired’ blogger discussing music and travel, a sophisticated and insightful Twitter account posing political and moral questions, an informal and honest Facebook account tailoring to a specific, familiar audience of ‘real-life- friends whilst maintaining a perhaps academic website. Many people consciously alter their sentence syntax and way of typing depending on the website and the situation, much in the same way that we tend to speak formally or informally depending on who it is we’re conversing with. Separating these characteristics of one’s self, much like one does with the self and the body in the disembodiment effect, allows one to construct various identity out with the realm of the&quot; one body one self&quot; idea held by in real, mortal society. &lt;ref&gt;NBaym, N. (2010). Personal Connections in the Digital Age: Digital Media and Society Series. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Multiplicity has serious implications for the responsibility of users online as some can use their fluid and multiple identities online to behave inappropriately without accountability.&lt;ref&gt;''Online Identity and Kids'', Common Sense Videos, YouTube. Available at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE0B82EwwNc&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jonathan Vanasco''' expands on the idea of multiple identities in his work on '''&quot;Meta-identites and identity facets&quot;'''. Vanasco asks the question that if we act differently around separate social circles within our life then shouldn't we be able to do so online? When people talk about internet activity, they generally think about their life online, - not their lives online. People tend to tailor their online identity to the given personality that each SNS tends to give off. As mentioned before Twitter is seen to be sophisticated, while blogs such as Tumbler/Instagram are seen to be more creative and youthful, whereas Facebook which started off with a more preppy personality has since evolved into a more casual all-round site for social media. So, in the end the world of our multiple identities becomes quite complicated, as we are:

 •Sharing different facets of our lives with our friends, our family and our colleagues.
 •Tailoring these facets to the personalities of certain networks.
 •Experiencing '''overlap''' between the facets (And this is where multiple online identities encounters problems)

With the ever-evolving nature of SNS's they are becoming more and more linked with one another. Many social media companies now contain the option to update all of your online profiles all at once and allows people viewing your profile with links to your other social media accounts. This is making things harder than ever before to keep multiple online personalities separate from one another as social networks continue to push for realism in people's accounts.

====The Ubiquity of Identity====

Jonathan Vanasco believes that our online identity is becoming increasingly more omnipresent in everything that we do. Today people have multiple social networking accounts, emails, online gaming profiles, education sites, workplace profiles, music streaming profiles, social calendars like Renkoo and even retailers are now going social like Amazon, eBay etc. People continue to create and accumulate multiple identity facets again and again. It is synonymous with the idea of ''ubiquity'' that our online identity is part of our new found Always-On Culture. People stay constantly connected to social media in order to keep up their image and representation of themselves to the people they allow to see it. This has increased dramatically over the past few years with the integration of smart phones and wireless internet all over the world.

See [[Digital_Media_and_Culture_Yearbook_2014/Chapter_3:_Always-on_Culture|Always-On Culture]]'s section on Danah Boyd and Ubiquity for more on this.

===Symbolic Interactionism===

Goffman argues that performers can form their audience’s impression of them consciously, for instance by learning their speech or coordinating their movements in certain ways, however sometimes they might make unconscious moves, such as tripping or forgetting their lines, which are still part of the overall impression of the performer.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, E. (1959) The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, New York: Anchor Books&lt;/ref&gt; Goffman’s theory about consciously and unconsciusly given signs can be applied to the online representation of people. Facebook users, for example can manage their friend’s impression of them by selecting the images they upload or the personal data they share. However some information of them can be still given away unintentionally, for instance when they are tagged in pictures or statuses they did not wish to, and it also shapes their self-performance and therefore this is also part of their persona. 

===Chat Rooms and Anonymity===

Statistics show that there are over 1,200 chat rooms on the internet that are easy to enter and are not regulated by a censoring body. &lt;ref&gt;Davidson, W (2012) “Tears and Fears; Help, Advice and Discussion for Victims of Child Sexual Abuse, Sex Trafficking, Date Rape, Internet Predators, Chat Rooms and Paedophiles '', (pp.34-93). London: emp3books&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, people of all ages, genders, races and backgrounds can have access to chat rooms where they can potentially speak to anybody in the world. There are concerns about whether this is safe and healthy and Davidson’s book focuses on the harm and abuse that comes from unprotected communications. The film, [[w:Trust_(2010_film)|“Trust,”]] by David Schwimmer looks into this idea as it focuses on the concern of many parents have that their child will become involved with a dangerous adult who emotionally manipulates them and abuses their trust.    &lt;ref&gt;Schwimmer, D. (2010) “Trust'', USA: Millennium Films &lt;/ref&gt; 

However, writer Rolf McEwan argues that chat rooms actually allow people to be more confident and natural as they don’t feel afraid of rejection from people they don’t know. &lt;ref&gt;McEwan, R (2013) “Chat Room: A Book of Blogs '', (p.23). New York: Create Space Independent Publishing Platform&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst friend groups people can have concerns about rejection if they say or do anything that the others won’t approve of. This theme is explored in the recent television series, [[w:My_Mad_Fat_Diary|My Mad Fat Diary]], which looks at how a girl with mental health issues struggles to be herself in a group of new friends who expect her to behave in a conventional manner. &lt;ref&gt;Kirby, Tim. (2013 and 2014) &quot;My Mad Fat Diary'',. UK: Tiger Aspect Productions&lt;/ref&gt;

McEwan’s argument is that although chat rooms might encourage anti-social behaviour or even false identities due to no accountability, it also gives people the freedom to explore their natural personalities through talking to another person whose opinion or reaction will not have such a problematic consequence to life, and therefore encourages self-conscious people to relax. Because users have the ability to engage in conversations without the other person having preconceptions about them or directly viewing them, they may feel as if there is none of the baggage that is tied to interaction elsewhere. For many, typing can be an easier way for them to get things off their chest, eliminating the unease of speech and giving an opportunity to thoroughly think through a statement or topic before bringing it up.

===Social Networking Sites===

====Promotion of Identity====

The digital domain is increasingly involved in the social dynamics of our lives. Emails, chat rooms and blogging all contribute to new ways of building social networks and provide creative platforms for self-expression. &lt;ref&gt;Van Koten, H. (2009). The Digital Image and the Pleasure Principle: The Consumption of Realism in the Age of Simulation. In Bentkowska-Kafel (Eds.), ''Digital Visual Culture: theory and practice'', (pp.92). Bristol: Intellect&lt;/ref&gt; Social Networking Sites (SNSs) are platforms for socially orientated activity that allow for an introduction of the self via public displays of connection. These public displays of connection are used to authenticate identity and introduce the self through the process of association with social circles. Individual and collective identities are simultaneously presented and promoted. SNSs are sites of self-presentation and identity negotiation. &lt;ref&gt;Papacharissi, Z. (2011) ''A Networked Self: Identity, Community and Culture on Social Network Sites'', (pp.304). Abingdon: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook is a prime example of how an SNS can help create and project an online identity. Each Facebook user has a profile page where they can describe themselves, their likes and their hobbies, and narrate their lives. Most users also have a profile picture to help identify themselves. SNSs are unique in combining multiple modes of communication and thus breadth of control over social cues.

Social media use within businesses is growing as a main focus of advertising campaigns. Around 80% of all businesses use, or are planning initiatives to use it &lt;ref&gt;Social Media: What Most Companies Don't Know, by Harvard Business Review, 2011 (http://hbr.org/web/slideshows/social-media-what-most-companies-dont-know/6-slide)&lt;/ref&gt;. Businesses use social media as a marketing tool – not only is it inexpensive, but effective in communicating with your market. Recent studies have shown that one third of adults under 30 now use social media instead of traditional media outlets such as newspapers or television, which means that social media use within a business is important to keep up to date with how people find information. Social media, for a business, can create an identity which is similar to that of the demographic that uses them – with certain demographics generally tending towards a certain social network&lt;ref&gt;Just Who Uses Social Media? A Demographic Breakdown, by Adam Popescu, 2013 (http://mashable.com/2013/04/12/social-media-demographic-breakdown)&lt;/ref&gt;, a business can strengthen their existing market, or create relations with areas outside of it. Social networks also give a platform for businesses to stray away from professionalism – becoming more 'human like', and giving a company a personal feel to it's structure.

We consciously and unconsciously work to define the way we are perceived, hoping to engender a positive impression of ourselves. Impression management entails putting effort into emphasising certain characteristics whilst diminishing or hiding others, and we are able to post information which presents a desired image. It is about presenting a highly selective version of the self. Even the choice of name on your email is an important marker of who we are. As Papacharissi words it, “The process of self-presentation becomes an ever-evolving cycle through which individual identity is presented, compared, adjusted, or defended against a constellation of social, cultural, economic, or political realities.”&lt;ref&gt;Papacharissi, Z. (2011) ''A Networked Self: Identity, Community and Culture on Social Network Sites'', (pp.304). Abingdon: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flexibility of the Self====

Many people create multiple SNS pages in order to aid their task of impression management. This multiplicity allows only select audiences to see a certain version of that person, or limits the wider world from being able to make the connection between the two as they wish to keep different parts of their lives and personalities separate. Creating multiple pages has a parallel to how we present different versions of ourselves in face-to-face contexts. Identity scholar Goffman argues that the self plays multiple roles in everyday life and cannot be understood adequately as a single unified entity. The self is flexible and multiple, taking different incarnations in different situations.&lt;ref&gt;Baym, N. (2010) ''Personal Connections in the Digital Age: Digital Media and Society Series'', (pp.106). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt; Impression management is about the balance of sharing, withholding and distorting information.

Online identity through textual media additionally offers different ways to get noticed compared to the real world and its social constructs. Physically attractive people will get noticed at a party, but articulate, insightful and witty people who know how to spell will get noticed online. Many use their online identity to achieve and satisfy needs they find difficult in the real world. Online identities allow the opportunity to be yourself or to be whoever you want to be. Liu (2007) examined over 127,000 MySpace profiles and revealed that on average user tended to differentiate themselves from friends rather than identifying with friends.&lt;ref&gt;Baym, N. (2010) ''Personal Connections in the Digital Age: Digital Media and Society Series'', (pp.111). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-expression and self-promotion on SNSs====

Looking at social networking sites it can be seen that they all work on a similar basis: they connect their users and let them present themselves to one an other in a way they wish. The number of SNS have increased and therefore various sites for various purposes can be found. José Van Dijck argues that users have a need to differentiate between their online personas, for most of them there is a significant difference between what they communicate to their friends and their professional persona that they share with their employers and colleagues. &lt;ref&gt;Van Dijck, J. (2013). ''You have one identity’: performing the self on Facebook and LinkedIn'' in ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'',35(2), 199-215, Doi:{10.1177/0163443712468605}.&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance while Facebook is used mostly for personal interactions, until LinkedIn is for professional networking. According to Jeff Weiner- CEO of LinkedIn- &quot;The key distinction is that as a professional you want people to want to know who you are. People are searching for you or people like you whether you like it or not.” &lt;ref&gt;Lapin, N. (2011.) ''CEO LinkedIn: the forgotten interview''. CBC NetNet, 23 October. Retrieved 04/02, 2014, from http://www.cnbc.com/id/43135238/LinkedIn_CEO_The_Forgotten_Interview&lt;/ref&gt;
Comparing Facebook and LinkedIn it can be seen that impression management –even though in a different way, but- implies to both sites. The users try to develop an ideal image of themselves. However, while Facebook was primarly created for self-expression, rather than self-promotion, LinkedIn mainly concentrates on self-advertising and showing off one’s skills. It has been referred as &quot;Facebook in a suit”. 
By having both Facebook and LinkedIn profiles users can present both their social and professional personas. According to Van Dijck &quot;Many users will try to synchronize their profiles on both sites, even if the interfaces on Facebook and LinkedIn force them to perform different strategies.” &lt;ref&gt;Van Dijck, J. (2013). ''You have one identity’: performing the self on Facebook and LinkedIn'' in ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'',35(2), 199-215, Doi:{10.1177/0163443712468605}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Professional Online Identity====

Professional online identity refers to a persons ideals, experiences, attitudes and beliefs in their professional career when they present themselves on an internet platform. 
The management of professional online identity is taking on a bigger role at the workplace, as employees are increasingly interacting with their professional contacts in online social networks that are personal in nature, such as Twitter or Facebook. This can lead to the collision of professional and personal identities.  
&quot;Online social networks present employees with boundary management and identity negotiation opportunities and challenges. Recent data point to a blurring of the professional and personal domains in online networks, which exacerbates the need for active boundary management.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Ollier-Malaterre, A., Rothbard, N.P. and Berg, J.T. 2013 &quot;When Worlds Collide In Cyberspace: How Boundary Work In Online Social Networks Impacts Professional Relationships.&quot; Academy Of Management Review 38.4: 645-669.  &lt;/ref&gt; 
A key feature that differentiates the contact online is that the information available is much less tailored to a particular conversation. In face-to-face and other individualized interactions (e.g. phone calls, emails, text messages) employees can manage the boundary between their professional and personal identities by restricting what and how much of personal information they present to their work contacts over time. And by adapting this disclosure to their particular dyadic relationships in a constant manner. &lt;ref&gt;Collins, R. 1981. On the microfoundations of macrosociology. American Journal of Sociology, 86: 984-1014&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although SMSs limit the flexibility of self-representational behavior, they also &quot;create[s] new opportunity structures to display identity cues and select interaction partners&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Swann, W.B., Jr. 1987. Identity negotiation: Where two roads meet. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53: 1038-1051.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Authenticity====

The development of social networking sites changed the way online identities are formed and presented. The first online identities in social media were in the form of emails and instant messengers where only thing that was required was a nickname. In 2002 Friendster was launched, which pioneered the online connection of real-life friends and was followed by MySpace and other Social Networking Sites, like Facebook in 2004, which promoted Clay Shirky (2003) to come up with the term ‘YASNS’: Yet Another Social Networking Service.&lt;ref&gt;boyd, danah, Ellison, Nicole (2008) ''Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scolarship'' in ''Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication&quot;, pp.214-216&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that online identities had to be more authentic, which is why creating a totally new online identity is more difficult. Authentic online identities mean that it has to have the user’s real name, real connections and, increasingly, their actions across cyberspace e.g. posting a Facebook picture via Instagram.&lt;ref&gt;Krotoski, Aleks (2012)&quot;Online identity: is authenticity or anonymity more important?&quot; in theguardian.com&lt;/ref&gt;

 
Yet, with the emergence of Twitter in 2006 and Tumblr in 2007 it is easier to create an online identity that is not real. But most users seem to have their Twitter account in their real name, with the people they know in real life following them. This shows how the emergence of authentic online identities makes people want to keep their online identities connected with their real life ones. Furthermore, with the authentic identities available, users have become more untrusting to non-authentic online identities. Despite this, Social Media like Tinder are popular, which shows that the need for authenticity is not a big enough concern.

====Complications====

The process of self-presentation through SNSs is complicated however. With the combination of a variety of audiences, of variable publicity and privacy settings, the individual must engage in multiple mini performances in order to produce a presentation of the self that makes sense to multiple audiences. In day-to-day life many people have the opinion that others should ‘take them as they are’. However, impression management is very contradictory to this stance as it raises questions concerning whether we genuinely think people should accept us as who we are. If this were the case, then privacy settings and account management would not nearly be as popular as they are.

The internet holds a utopian potential for our relationships and our self expression as it has the potential to bridge divides and create meaningful new connections. However, more often than not, the internet and SNSs are accused of leading people to lie about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Baym, N. (2010) ''Personal Connections in the Digital Age: Digital Media and Society Series'', (pp.100). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, just how much of an individual we really are on SNSs is contentious as SNSs engineer self-presentation by providing predetermined sets of categories through which to build identities. It limits the extent to which anyone can call themselves an individual and fully express their identity.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier Jaron Lanier] &lt;ref&gt; Lanier, J.(2011). You Are Not A Gadget. Penguin: London &lt;/ref&gt; said that the most important thing about a technology was how it changed people and warns of the restrictions of being ‘Locked-in’ to a particular technology. There is support for this concern in terms of online identity within social networks from Geert Lovink .&lt;ref&gt;Lovink, G. (2011). “Networks Without A Cause: A Critique of Social Networks”, (p.41). Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that there is little freedom to present yourself in different ways online and social networking sites only offer users a limited choice of presenting their personal and professional information to the world. He goes on to quote critic Zadie Smith who challenges this narrow choice forced on users by Facebook in saying, “What kind of living is this? Step back from your Facebook Wall for a moment:  doesn’t it, suddenly, look a little ridiculous? Your life in this format”. This seems to crystallise Lanier’s point about the problems with being Locked-in to a particular technology:  our online identities, which are a presentation of our lives, are “force-fitted” into a format to enable social networking sites to neatly package users’ information to monetise the content.

====Profile Pictures====

In their book ‘A Networked Self’ &lt;ref&gt;Papacharissi, Z. (2011). A Networked Self: Identity, Community and Culture on Social Network Sites. Oxon: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; [[w:Zizi_Papacharissi|Papcharissi]] and Mendelson investigate Facebook photo galleries and the connection this has with online identity. The study concludes that individuals knowingly and unknowingly seek to define a positive impression of themselves through the use of SNS, and in particular, using profile pictures. Profile pictures are important as it is the only picture that can be viewed by the majority of users online. It is chosen to covey something about themselves which is generally positive, to the rest of the world. 

The digital age allows for the creation of virtual communities, where social groups interact with one another and observer individual profiles to gain a sense of their personality. Pictures on Facebook express particular values of the person portraying them. Wells &lt;ref&gt; Wells, L. (2000). ''Photography: A critical introduction''. Routledge, London.&lt;/ref&gt; argues , states that photography was previously known for capturing a moment in absolute accuracy, maintaining a faithful and true image of an event. However, as the digital age has intensified with SNS, the use of digital photography allows Impression Management. Therefore, profile pictures are not necessarily a true representation of that person. Individuals can communicate their values, relationships and sociability, in the way they wish the rest of SNS users to perceive them. This entails emphasising and diminishing characteristics of character through editing, creating a perceived persona that may not be accurate. Papacharissi and Mendelson &lt;ref&gt;Papacharissi, Z. (2011). A Networked Self: Identity, Community and Culture on Social Network Sites. Oxon: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that the use of profile pictures allows for narcissism, creating a culture of self-absorbed individuals. Although profile pictures are understood as being a representation of individuals to the rest of the SNS community, the use of Impression Management risks people creating a persona of themselves, inferring qualities and perpetuating a deceptive performance to their online audience.

====Security and Privacy in Social Media====

With the reveals in 2013 of the NSA's vast monitoring of international internet traffic including social media&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian (2013): http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files&lt;/ref&gt;, online privacy and security have been highlighted. Having said that, according to Cisco's 2012 Connected World Technology Report, 91% of all those aged 18-30 believe that &quot;the age of privacy is over&quot;. 
Further more, they found that: &quot;...one third of the respondents are[sic] not worried about all the data that is stored and captured about them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;CISCO Connected World Technology Report (2012): http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/solutions/enterprise/connected-world-technology-report/ASR_CCWTR_Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

These numbers are backed up by similar surveys done by CIFAS, the UK's Fraud Prevention Service, which state:

 - '88% of people who use social networking sites having shared information that could be used to commit identity fraud'
They further back CISCO's numbers by stating: &quot;Furthermore, only 18% of those interviewed said they were concerned about sharing information on or the security risk of social networking sites, 
with 10% sharing information about others that could then be used to assume their identities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;CIFAS:(2014) http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/Identity_fraud_continues_to_rise_with_4_million_victims_in_UK_alone&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems then that, especially with younger generations, we do not worry about our data online. There is almost an attitude of &quot;Who cares? How can it affect me?&quot; amongst those who do not believe that we have any real privacy online. On the one hand, this could be true. In the context of social media, and in this case Facebook, there are over 1 billion users&lt;ref&gt;Statisticbrain (2014): http://www.statisticbrain.com/facebook-statistics/&lt;/ref&gt; and it could at least hypothetically be argued that with that many people's data floating around in that sphere, the chances of you particular data's security and privacy being broken are relatively small merely due to numbers alone. This, however, is only a very small part of the debate around data's privacy as it completely ignores the inherent value of said data - to both you its owner and to Facebook or any company that they may &quot;share&quot; your data with. The current situation regarding social media is akin to a mixture of the concerns raised in both Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World and George Orwell’s 1984, as rather pessimistically it could be said that through social media while our attention is often driven away from pressing matters to leisure and unimportant banter we are having a considerable chunk of our online data observed and collated by it at the same time. 

In his book 'Social Media a Critical Introduction' &lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, C. (2014). Social media a critical introduction [California] Sage Publications&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Fuchs argues that Facebook is:
&quot;...a typical manifestation of a stage of capitalism in which the relation of public and private, and labour and play, collapses, and in which this collapse is exploited by capital.&quot;, exploitation being a very apt term for the current policies adopted by Facebook and similar networking sites. Social media agencies have stated that to advertisers, the monetary value of a Facebook member exhibiting loyalty to their brand has ranged from around $118 to $174. The issue of privacy aside, the practice of selling account information to others is arguably dehumanising, as rather than further an individual’s own unique identity it facilitates the ability of businesses to reduce people to mere statistics.

This idea is backed up by Hannah Arendt in her book The Human Condition&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, H. (1958). The human condition. [Chicago]: University Of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, where she states that: &quot;The distinction between the private and the public realms [...] equals the distinction between things that should be shown and things that should not be hidden.&quot;  In the context of Facebook this can be taken multiple ways. Fuchs argues that the main issue of public vs private for Facebook lies in the fact that Facebook has access to and essentially owns all of its users data whereas the users do not have nearly as much access to Facebook's internal workings and its own data. In this context it becomes very much about the equality of privacy measures, where the passage of information from user to supplier is of a much higher volume than that of the supplier to the individual user. When looked at through the prism of Marxist theory, as stated before, it raises issues of exploitation as it is the very data that users are generating that companies like Facebook are making money from. Just as in a factory where the workers are selling their time to create commodities for the factory, the users' are creating data for the company. The major and very important difference lies in the reimbursement of the individual users for their &quot;labour&quot;; which is to say that there is effectively very little of it. The concept of &quot;Free Labour&quot; is one that has risen to the surface in recent years in discussions of online data mining and commodification of users to describe the idea that users are essentially creating the commodity that these companies make their money on (data and information) but are not being paid or reimbursed for it. 

Indeed, the exploitation exhibited by social media providers and especially Facebook have drawn harsh criticism from those who are involved in studying social media. Rory O'Connor, author of &quot;Friends, followers and the future.&quot; stated in an article for Huffington post: &quot;[Social networking services] profit primarily by using heretofore private information it has collected about you to target advertising. And Zuckerberg has repeatedly made sudden, sometimes ill conceived and often poorly communicated policy changes that resulted in once-private personal information becoming instantly and publicly accessible. As a result, once-latent concerns over privacy, power and profit have bubbled up and led both domestic and international regulatory agencies to scrutinize the company more closely ... The high-handed manner in which members' personal information has been treated, the lack of consultation or even communication with them beforehand, Facebook's growing domination of the entire social networking sphere, Zuckerberg's constant and very public declarations of the death of privacy and his seeming imposition of new social norms all feed growing fears that he and Facebook itself simply can not be trusted.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rory O'Connor (2012): http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rory-oconnor/facebook-privacy_b_1426807.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem, then, becomes one of trust. Not only in the media companies, but in your fellow Facebook or social network users. It is not uncommon to hear the phrase &quot;If you didn't want anyone else to see it, you shouldn't have put it online.&quot; in relation to any data that users put online for what is their assumed own private use. The obvious implication being that on the internet, we cannot trust anyone enough to not &quot;leak&quot; our private data provided there is enough incentive. The most extreme example of this are the so called &quot;Revenge porn&quot; sites, but in more day-to-day matters it is all too common to have to ask friends to untag or delete a photo of you that is particularly unflattering on social media. It again raises questions over how much control we actually have over our own data, where it goes and who sees it. After all, a very common chain of events can be a friend posts a picture of you on their timeline, that picture and perhaps the location that it was taken becomes associated with all the other data about you currently held online by the social media provider and is used to target ads at you. All of this happens nearly instantaneously and the only way to really stop it is to stop your friend from posting the picture in the first place.

What this points to is the need for a more active user than the traditionally passive archetype that social media suppliers like Facebook have become used to exploiting for commercial gain - the so called &quot;Prosumer&quot; idea that was first posited by Alvin Toffler in 1980 in his book The Third Wave and then expanded by Bruns to be a &quot;produser&quot; in 2009. Clarke defines a prosumer or produser as: &quot;A prosumer is a consumer who is proactive (e.g. is demanding, and expects interactivity with the producer) and/or a producer as well as a consumer (e.g. one who expects to be able to exploit digital content for mashups).&quot; This proactive consumer is one who is much more likely to demand privacy and security for their data than a passive consumer and this, Clarke says, is likely to push forward a trend of distrust for social media sites and force them to change their privacy and data security policies.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Clarke(2013): http://www.rogerclarke.com/DV/SMTD.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social Networks and advertising====

The terms ''Social network advertising'' or ''Social media targeting'' refer to forms of online advertisement that specifically focus on their presence on social networking sites. Social network advertising involves adverts being tailored to user information gathered from social media profiles. Given the enormous audience size and amount of time regularly spent on social networking sites, companies are increasingly becoming aware of the vast potential lying in SNSs. Consequently, online advertising is experiencing a shift from simply being distributed through websites to efficiently tracking and gathering user behaviour and personal information on SNSs. This enables brands to identify and address their target audience and people that their product might appeal to based on their interests. The fact that this information originates from the customers themselves is very beneficial to companies as personal data can be analysed in detail without having to rely on their own statistical projections. Two strategies used in social network advertising are ''targeted advertising''' and ''customised advertising''.

With ''targeted advertising'', brands aim to shape their product display according to website relevant content or their target group’s interests. While content-targeted advertising is adapted to the particular purpose and content of a website the advert banner is displayed on, targeted advertising tracks the users’ surfing behaviour on the internet. Several websites require users to register with their Facebook accounts in order to later display similar advertising content on the social network site. Through the use of cookies, people can be tracked back to recently visited websites and are therefore likely to be exposed to similar content on other websites. Companies are also able to track whether one of their adverts has been encountered by a particular customer before and are consequently able to avoid exposing the same user to the same advertising multiple times and thus display their advertising with appropriate intervals &lt;ref&gt;Braun, M. (2011). ''Measuring Online Advertising Effectiveness''. Retrieved From: http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/wcai/files/WCAI_Case_Study_Ad_Effectiveness_Final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. A look-a-like function enables the detection of Facebook users with similar interests as the one recently accessing a particular website. 

Moving away from simply tracking people’s surfing behaviour via cookies, online advertising has experienced an important shift to placing greater emphasis on using profile information on SNSs to create ''customised advertisements'' &lt;ref&gt;Spyer, N. (2013). ''Taking advantage of targeted advertisements on social media''. Retrieved From: http://www.theguardian.com/salesforce-partner-zone/taking-advantage-of-targeted-advertisements-on-social-media&lt;/ref&gt;. Social network accounts sell valuable information about users’ location, interests and social circles to advertising agencies and companies themselves. Likes and links to external websites further give an idea of potential customers that might be targeted in future. Users receive pre-selected adverts that are believed to be most compatible with their demands and interests (as determined through their account details) and therefore should be more appealing to them. 

However the massive amount of data generated by “real identities“ via social networks is also centre of the growing debate on the implications of the web 3.0&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, R. (2012). ''The dark side of the personalised internet''. Retrieved From: http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2012/02/the-dark-side-to-personalised-internet.html&lt;/ref&gt;. As Joseph Turow suggests “the new advertising industry is defining your identity and your world“ &lt;ref&gt;Turow, J. (2012). ''The daily you: How the new advertising industry is defining your identity and your worth''. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; through displaying user customised advertisements on social networks. In this way commodification, capitalist social relations and market forces increasingly engage in and detemine people’s social life by exploiting the fact that to a large extent social interactions are taking place online &lt;ref&gt;Cohen, N. S. (2008). The Valorization of Surveillance: Towards a Political Economy of Facebook. Democratic Communiqué, 22(1).&lt;/ref&gt;. Consequently social networks have to be considered a double-edged sword &lt;ref&gt;van Dijck, J. (2013). The culture of connectivity: A critical history of social media. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. While on the one hand being intensely empowering for its users, the fact that their data is under constant surveillance by data mining and analytics companies such as Daily Me, Medicx Media and Rapleaf can also lead to consumers restisting &lt;ref&gt;White, T., Zahay, D., Thorbjornsen, H. &amp; Shavitt, S. (2008). &quot;Getting too personal: Reactance to highly personalized email solicitations&quot;. Marketing Letters 19(1), 39–50&lt;/ref&gt;. Thereby, the root of the problem is the fact that boundaries between advertising and content shaping the 20th-century media are being blurred through networking sites &lt;ref&gt;Turow, J. (2012). ''The daily you: How the new advertising industry is defining your identity and your worth''. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; . However, the significance of personalised advertising does not only make user data a valuable criteria to shape brands after but goes even further. Through “social sorting“ social networks even impact structures of society in allocating people to “target“ or “waste“ &lt;ref&gt;Turow, J. (2012). ''The daily you: How the new advertising industry is defining your identity and your worth''. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; groups based on information published on their profiles. Brands can explicitly filter out the users that are most valuable to them in terms of a responsiveness to their product based on their interests, income or other characteristics.  In this way the advertisement that is presented to each individual user is indicating their social position in the eyes of companies, making advertisement become status signals &lt;ref&gt;Turow, J. (2012). ''The daily you: How the new advertising industry is defining your identity and your worth''. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Nevertheless, companies have to consider the discrepancy between online and offline identity as so far social sorting processes are simply based on personal information generated on SNSs. Therefore customer profiles only limitedly reflect the “real“ person behind the profile, including their demands of a product. While social media’s functionality provide the tools for people to construct an online identity they are also heavily shaped after the economic purpose of the site. Cohen suggests that due to their design and the normalisation of the sharing culture SNSs can be considered part of an increasing commodification of identity through the influence of corporate interests &lt;ref&gt;Cohen, N. S. (2008). The Valorization of Surveillance: Towards a Political Economy of Facebook. Democratic Communiqué, 22(1).&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Reputation Systems and SNS====

Reputation systems rank the users of a website based on criteria such as number of posts or trustworthiness regarding online monetary transactions. They are often utilized on places of online commerce such as Amazon or eBay, however they are becoming an increased presence on social media where the more Facebook likes or re-tweets a post gets, the more people see it. This is a new communicative concept since human beings do not usually quantify popularity in their day to day lives and it establishes a sort of hierarchy of thought where originality, creativity, and wit are some of the more valuable traits. And while it's arguably a better use of cognitive surplus than mindless consumption, rarely do these reputation systems seem to carry any real purpose or meaning.

====Location-based Real-time Dating====

Other than the popular online social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter which can be used for dating interface, there are now a series of mobile applications that act as not only a social media platform but combine that with online dating. These apps are known as location-based real-time dating (LBRTD) apps and are massively popular within current society. An example of these is [[w:Grindr|Grindr]], a dating app that allows homosexuals to find other single people within a close proximity to themselves. However, Jeremy Birnholtz has described Grindr as being a virtual place for singles that &quot;creates tension in users’ strategies for self-presentation as they craft positive identities in an environment where identifiability by outsiders may be perceived negatively.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Birnholtz, &quot;Seeing and being seen: Co-situation and impression formation using Grindr, a location-aware gay dating app&quot; 2014, http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/02/06/1461444814521595.full&lt;/ref&gt; The two big players in this field are the popular mobile applications Grindr and Tinder.

=====Grindr=====
As previously mentioned, Grindr is a mobile LBRTD app which is aimed specifically at gay men. There is, like with most social media, a problem with identity theft. There is a limited number of photos that you can have on your profile and therefore, since it requires less information to look as legitimate as Facebook, for example. Due to this, it would seem easier to lie about you identity via the app. However, Grindr are aware of this and have set up a complaint policy with regards to imposters and fake profile. 

{{Quote box|width=700px|align=left|
 |quote  = Users must follow these steps to lodge a complaint:

1. Report the impostor. Tap the gray flag in his profile to report him.

2. Send us your Grindr Account Email Address (or BlackBerry support code). This will help us find your profile.

3. Write your email address on a piece of paper. Send us a clear photo of yourself holding the piece of paper.

4. Send a random photo of yourself. We need to make sure you're the 'real' you.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Report an Impostor or Fake Profile&quot;, 2013 (http://help.grindr.com/hc/en-us/articles/200302264-Report-an-Impostor-or-Fake-Profile)&lt;/ref&gt;}}














Also, due to the fact that there is little room for users to expand their personality beyond their very limiting profile, many people argue that this limits identity. &quot;The design of Grindr provides men little room in their profiles to elucidate upon their personality or interests. This tranching of their identities to just physicality has the effect of reducing them to objects, like the models in advertisements.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Woo, 2013 &quot;Meet Grindr: How One App Changed the Way We Connect&quot; p.133&lt;/ref&gt; This objectification is what has created the stereotype that Grindr is only for gay hook-ups. This lack of real identity within the app has transformed itself to being looked as being purely sexually charged and therefore, Grindr can be described as being an online social network that almost encourages online identities to be separate from offline ones.

=====Tinder=====
[[w:Tinder_(application_software)|Tinder]] is much the same as Grindr, but is aimed at both homosexuals and heterosexuals. It's set up is very similar to that of Grindr, however there are some differences. Tinder's slogan is &quot;Tinder is how people meet. It's like real life, but better.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tinder, 2014 (http://www.gotinder.com/)&lt;/ref&gt; This slogan denotes a few things - firstly, it openly suggests that it is a completely online community as it overtly claims to not be real life, but that it is better. Therefore, this could be actively encouraging users to think of their online selves as being different to their offline selves, and to lose their inhibitions because Tinder and the real world are two separate locations and that the two may never collide. However, this would seem to completely contradict the idea of Tinder, in that it is a dating app that is fundamentally about people meeting and beginning a relationship. 
Another thing about Tinder is that it needs to have access to your Facebook account to allow you to become a user. Therefore it relies on previously available information to function. Using Tinder also means handing over large  amounts of information about your identity to them, and although &quot;Tinder says that they won’t share your private info or activity on Tinder with Facebook or other users, but they’re totally fine with selling it to third-parties and vendors they were work with.  Just know they could be shipping off your sexual preference, desired age in a mate, and conversations had via Tinder’s chat feature, to advertisers and third-parties.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;5 Privacy Tips for Tinder&quot;, by Olivia Campbell, 2013 (http://www.abine.com/blog/2013/5-privacy-tips-for-tinder/)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore Tinder is not as identity friendly as they would have you believe, and users' privacy is not completely contained to the owners of Tinder.

====YouTube and Vlogging====

YouTube is a public video sharing site created in 2005. People of all ages, races and genders use YouTube as a way of forming an online identity. Among entertaining home video clips, and amateur short films, Video Blogging (Vlogging) is one of YouTube’s most popular trends, as it provides a medium to create a publically accessible performance of “the real me”. Hobsbawn sees the current age as defined by a “hunger for a secure identity” (Strangelove,2010). This then highlights the obvious attraction of Vlogging, as a way for any person with a video camera and an internet connection to document their identity and present it for the world to see. Vlogging is one of the rawest forms of media as it is simply people sharing their feelings and experiences with the world, and as Van Koten states while discussing McLuhan’s theories concerning hot and cold media “…when we peel away the layers of media we ultimately end up with human experience”. (Van Koten, 2009) This closeness to human experience and supposed honesty that people put across in Video Blogs (Vlogs) encourages others to use this medium and share their own feeling and experiences in order to feel like an individual within a community. Mendelson and Papacharissi discuss how Carey (1975) “emphasised a ritual view of communication which helps foster community integration through the sharing of common experiences and values” (Mendelson &amp; Papacharissi, 2011). It is true that YouTube is seen as a community and safe place to share these feelings and experiences and the users of YouTube are regularly referred to as the “YouTube Community”. But why do people use this public video forum to share these inner most confessions rather than keeping a physical diary or having real life conversations. Sherry Turkle states in her TED Talks “Connected, but alone?” that “the feeling that ‘no one is listening to me’ makes us want to send time with machines that seem to care about us” (Turkle, 2012). YouTube provides an instant audience of listeners for any user, millions of people can access a Vlog at any one time, the community of an instant audience must surely play a key factor in why people choose to share their life experiences via Vlogs as opposed though real life social interaction. However, Turkle also states that through her research she has discovered that many feel that a feeling or experience is not valid until it is shared through the internet, usually via some form of SNS “I share therefore I am” (Turkle,2012). So, by sharing these personal/confessional videos on YouTube, not only do users receive and instant audience to listen to their feelings as they try to work out their own identity, but they also gain validations of those feelings through the process of sharing. The idea of being part of a community which also validates ones inner most feelings must surely be an appealing one for many, hence the popularity of Vlogs on YouTube. However, the identities presented on YouTube are not necessarily exact representations of how those users behave in their real world lives. Michael Strangelove in his book “Watching YouTube: extraordinary videos by ordinary people” discusses how “There are hundreds of videos online title ‘the real me’ that explore the difference between videographers on-screen persona and their ‘real’ self.” He goes on to give an example of a video made by college student Kevin Wu with the above title, Kevin explains how he is a different person from his videos, “You don’t know me…you don’t really know someone through the internet” (Strangelove, 2010). The construction of an ideal persona on SNS is seen across all mediums; YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr etc. When discussing the formulation of college students photos galleries on Facebook Mendelson and Papacharissi state that we “consciously and unconsciously transform ourselves before the camera, portraying a version of ourselves we wish to be” (Mendelson &amp; Papacharissi,2011). So, while people wish to feel that their feeling are validated and they as themselves are accepted as part of a community, the common case is still that they present an ideal version of themselves and push that forward to be accepted as their true identity, whether is accurately reflects their real world persona or not.

===The Self Discrepancy Theory===

Edward Tory Higgins (1987)  introduced the concept of 'Self-Discrepancy Theory', which can be linked to the idea of the development of and the need for online identities in general. The theory suggests that one's personality is constructed through several different domains. Other than one's actual personality there is a wide range of other 'selfs' that might influence the behavior of this individual, such as the ideal or ought self. &quot;One domain of the self (actual; ideal; ought) and one standpoint on the self (own; significant other) constitute each type of self-state representation. &quot; Any discrepancies between the actual self-concept and the ideal-self states (what the individual hopes to become or aspires to be like) may lead to negative outcomes, such as feelings of disappointment or dissatisfaction with the self and lead to a vulnerable state in which an individual's self-esteem is significantly lowered. On the other hand discrepancies between a self-concept and ought-self states (that is representations of an individual's beliefs about his or her own or a significant other's beliefs about the individual's duties, responsibilities, or obligations) may lead to agitation-related emotions, such as fear or feelings of threat. 
In order to avoid these discrepancies impression management may be used to control how one sees themselves and is seen by others. After all, online identities are manageable representations of the self that can in fact be manipulated to extents, that largely influence impressions. It does not only allow the impression of outsiders to be altered, but also can function in order to clarify one's ideal self image for themselves. Therefore if online identities are managed this way, not only discrepancies may be avoided that may lead to emotional discomfort or agitation-related feelings, however it may also improve one's idea of their ideal self and may encourage them to alter their behaviors in order to change accordingly.

==Belonging==

Many use the opportunity and possibility of an online identity in order to gain or experience a sense of belonging. Every year more people write blogs, participate in online discussions, share information, music and photos, and upload videos. Making things and sharing them online is a process that creates networks, emotional support and significant social bonds.

In an online community one can get a sense of a shared space, experience rituals of shared practices, exchange social support, and the shared identities all contribute to a feeling of community.&lt;ref&gt;Baym, N. (2010). ''Personal Connections in the Digital Age: Digial Media and Society Series'', (pp.86). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt; Many join groups as already share a social identity such as race, ethnicity or profession.

===Blogging===

Blogging is one way in which a sense of belonging can be and is achieved. Blogging connects people with others who share similar ideas, feelings and topical associations. Research carried out by David Brake revealed that seventy per cent of all blogs are personal blogs.&lt;ref&gt;Gauntlett, D. (2011) ''Making is Connecting: The Social Meaning of Creativity'', (pp.104). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt; Writing a blog allows you to pursue desires to communicate.

Blogs are not just webpages in the traditional sense; blogging also covers the contemporary social network statuses seen on sites such as Facebook and Twitter. David Gauntlett asked and completed a survey in his book ''Making is Connecting'' on why people use Twitter. The main reasons were so that others can learn and be entertained; in a desire to share thoughts and creative endeavours; to chronicle their existence; self-promotion; contributing to and being part of a community; and for a sense of being heard.&lt;ref&gt;Gauntlett, D. (2011) ''Making is Connecting: The Social Meaning of Creativity'', (pp.100). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt; This research highlighted the importance of warm social connections, recognition and appreciation. These are aspects that are vital in a community and for a sense of belonging. On blogs where response is desired and encouraged, such as on SNSs, the importance in commenting and discussion is focused around warm social  connections, recognition and appreciation for those who invest significant amounts of time in the creation of online content.&lt;ref&gt;Gauntlett, D. (2011) ''Making is Connecting: The Social Meaning of Creativity'', (pp.104). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt; A study was also carried out about why people use Facebook. This research revealed that the combination of low effort and social rewards and connections made it worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;Gauntlett, D. (2011) ''Making is Connecting: The Social Meaning of Creativity'', (pp.96). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook only requires simple and momentary inputs, and in return you get to be part of an active social network. This all can lead to a sense of mutual engagement and community, and importantly a sense of belonging via online identity.

The concept of wanting to share one’s ideas has been existent for a very long time. However, it is a difficult thing to get your thoughts and opinions published for the wider world to see. Whether it is a factual informative book or a fictional piece, it is challenging to find a publisher who is willing to accept your work amongst the thousands, if not millions of other submissions. However, the evolution of online blogging has changed this and now people are free to promote and publicise their own writing online and on a very big scale. The online space is so vast, endless and accessible that blogging has opened up the chance for endless publications, which do not require the grueling process of being accepted and selected.

===Citizen Journalism===

This is essentially a form of activity which has stemmed from blogging. The ability to participate in media, particularly news, brings a great sense of importance and belonging. There used to be a 'structured break' between news production and consumption and these lines are now becoming blurred. &lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Henry (2006). Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide. New York: New York University Press. p. 308,&lt;/ref&gt; It has created a new variation of web user, the prosumer. If an individual feels they are contributing, it will undoubtedly confirm that their online presence is of value. The monumental shift from audience consumption to participation or even production means that there is a sense of community within the title of 'citizen journalist'.

Technology has contributed to the rising popularity of gathering and producing news online. Wireless internet and smartphones have allowed individuals in the 'right place at the right time' to become an active participant in journalism. By extension, social media has become a platform for news to travel. The content is read, shared, discussed and debated which would suggest users of networking sites can deliver their news on their own terms. As citizen journalism is not bound by conventional journalistic codes, therein lies opportunity for opinion and discussion. Comments are not only optional, they are encouraged by online news organisations to convey that public opinion is of any importance to issue at hand.

Joy Rosen describes the phenomenon as &quot;the people formerly known as the audience employ the press tools they have in their possession to inform one another&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Jay Rosen (14 July 2008). &quot;A Most Useful Definition of Citizen Journalism&quot;. PressThink &lt;/ref&gt; This user generated content has influenced some historical political movements, such as the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street and many others. This is a form of power that people can seize and use as they see fit, to benefit what is important to the individual and society.

===Performance and Ownership on Facebook===

Our online identity as well as our online presence is a constant performance and battle for ownership. If one studies Facebook, then it is apparent that the content of a person’s profile is heavily manipulated and edited in order to create a certain persona.

Every Facebook page may seem like a boring repeated formula that has no individuality in comparison to the millions of others. However, Facebook does allow people to note what: music, films, t/v programmes, shops, books and concepts they like. A person can also share personal information about their lives, photographs and links to show that they are unique and different from everybody else. 

But, because of technological manipulation, social networks allow people to not show their true, holistic, authentic self-warts and all. Facebook insists that people see a warped and superficial image of identities after they have been carefully manufactured and approved. This behaviour is a result of needing to feel that one’s performance is in line with social conventions and rules of character groups. As a result one’s Facebook page is not entirely owned by them as their submissions are psychologically stimulated by the wider community and what one posts is dictated by the socially accepted principles of one’s given social circle.

In a book by Richard Jenkins about social identities he mentions that social sites on the internet have created a new art of performance relationships and stages for social ideologies. &lt;ref&gt; Jenkins, R (2008) &quot;Social Identities&quot;, (pp.1-64). Oxford: Routledge Publishers &lt;/ref&gt; He argues that people feel conditioned by those who view their online presence and participation and their interactions are based on a need to conform due to the pressures of being witnessed by a large and critical audience.

===Welcome and Unwelcome Responses to Facebook Posts===

Facebook is a forum where people can voice their individuality by posting on their own page and editing their profiles. Because each page belongs to a single person then in a sense the content belongs to them and they have a right to share it regardless of other people’s reactions. However, people on Facebook often get responses to their posts which challenge and cause controversy. This is done by Facebook friends being able to, “like,” a post, commenting on it or uploading entirely new material. Some feel that negative responses are unwelcome because the page is representative of them alone, rendering it a safe, respected and personal space for their online identity. On the other hand, others feel that if you post something on Facebook then you are allowing your Facebook friends to see and subsequently you are inviting their contributions and permitting debate.

===Fan Culture===

Online fan communities have grown rapidly with the development of digital technology and social media websites. Originating from the ‘real life’ social groups that congregated together to share in their common interest, fan groups have only developed a stronger presence online that ever before.

Cultural analyst Myc Wiatrowski, studied online fan communities and observed that; “Fandoms, in the information age, have become a well-connected global village capable of coordinated and immediate worldwide contact”.&lt;ref&gt;Wiatrowski, M. (2011) ''The Dynamics of Fandom: Exploring Fan Communities in Online Spaces'', (pp.1-2) . Paper, Ohio State University&lt;/ref&gt; Highlighting how new technology and media has enabled these ‘fandoms’ to develop and also created a stronger sense of belonging.

That sense of belonging is a large factor in fan participation. Without the implications of face to face interactions users are able to freely interact and bond with other like-minded people and can develop an online identity that they choose. There are many different types of online fan communities; however the fastest growing have surrounded popular texts, films and celebrities. Popular young adult novels such at Twilight are excellent examples of online ‘fandom’, in which the texts are re-interpreted and re-written by fans. The monetisation incentives offered by video hosting sites like YouTube, in addition to ad revenue on fan sites, also appear to be actively encouraging the creation of new fan-made product, which in turn acts as free advertising for the media that are the focus of them. The protection of having an online identity and belonging to a large online group allows the fans to share dramatic adaptations they would not normally share in everyday life. Similarly celebrity fans such as ‘The Directioners’ fans of boy band One Direction use their online presence as a ‘protected’ way of contacting the band, with total disinhibition.

===The Need for Online Evidence===

With online culture there is a need to feel like one’s online existence sends a strong message of the self.  Theorist Ainslie McDermott who specialises in the reasoning behind online behaviour suggests that in various arenas people choose to post certain material because they feel it will present a positive or specific image of their lives. &lt;ref&gt; McDermott, A (2012) Clones: How technology has made us all the same, (pp.5-35). &lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, when blogging, some people find it important to show that they are culturally aware whether that is through sharing their awareness of: the news, politics, celebrity culture, science, technology or indeed any subject. McDermott argues that the content of a blog is not just about sharing information, or doing an activity because one enjoys it, but more because there is a need to evidence a certain type of character.
Likewise, with Facebook, McDermott notes that profile pictures and cover photos are chosen to make a statement about what type of person you are. Uploaded photos usually reveal a great deal. Pictures from a night out might suggest that you are fun and outgoing. Pictures of couples suggest that you are lovable and able to sustain a positive relationship. Pictures of somebody on holiday suggest that you are cultured and even possibly rich enough to spend time away. Also the chosen location often says a lot about the person and what they choose to take photos of. Pictures of somebody doing charity work suggests that they are giving and almost implies that they have no time for superficial fun but concentrate on, “what really matters in life,” as McDermott says.

Lastly, who a person follows on Twitter reflects the type of role model they admire or are interested in. People often feel a need to show a connection to the most socially conventional celebrities rather than those who suggest a more independent character that allows a person to branch out of a social clique.   
McDermott’s study deems that behind all the reasoning for online activity, the manner in which people participate and the content in which they link themselves with is an attempt to evidence a strong social belonging.

===Online Gaming===

The gaming world allows the creation of personas through the development of virtual identities. In a multitude of games, online avatars can be customised, from their looks, clothing to their personalities. Players can therefore surpass offline identities, such as gender race and political beliefs; they become someone else, in a virtual world where their real character is hidden. Cultural habits can be expressed online, such as class, as well as a sense of cultural community and belonging. Online gaming has been used by some youth as a means for relieving stress, and can be viewed as a positive outlet for pent-up frustration. Conversely, studies have shown that those with pre-existing conditions play more frequently than others, gaming itself does little to solve the existent problems which have led to the escapism, and these more frequent gamers may be inclined to devote their time to gaming rather than tackle any problems head-on. This can lead to further stress, even more attempts to evade stressful situations, and lead to a vicious circle. &lt;ref&gt;Kuss, D.J. &amp; Griffiths, M.D. (2012). Online gaming addiction in adolescence: A literature review of empirical research. Journal of Behavioural Addiction, 1(1) pp.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the use on online identities is harmless to many users, there is the risk of addiction to online identities in the virtual, gaming world. The online identity of those in the gaming world is uniquely experimental &lt;ref&gt;Marwick, A. (2005). ‘Selling yourself:online identity in the age of a commodified Internet.’&lt;/ref&gt;, with people playing with their personas and personality to become someone they aspire to be, or lead the life they've always dreamed of within the realms of websites and gaming communities.

Online gaming can therefore become an addiction as a direct result of people maintaining the power to control the plot and story of their virtual life for themselves &lt;ref&gt;Clark, N. (2009). ‘Game addiction: the experience and the effect.’ McFarland &amp; Company Inc., North Caroline&lt;/ref&gt;. People step inside a world where they can create situations that wouldn’t happen in the nature of real life&lt;ref&gt;Clark, N. (2009). ‘Game addiction: the experience and the effect.’ McFarland &amp; Company Inc., North Caroline&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, one may feel a sense of disinhibition within their virtual life’s, contradicting their real life social being. One may adopt a life secondary to their reality, enabling them to roleplay as a virtual and highly idealised version of themselves. &lt;ref&gt;Marwick, A. (2005). ‘Selling yourself:online identity in the age of a commodified Internet.’&lt;/ref&gt;. This can be taken a step further, with users encompassing a dissociative imagination.

The rise of Player vs Player (PvP) gaming has led to many gamers, especially within the game itself, having their identity of playing the game above many offline identities, such as race, gender, political or economic viewpoints becoming irrelevant. This use of anonymity within PvP gaming can reduce or challenge the pre-existing concepts of certain offline identities.

===Fashion Industry===
Similarly, the concept of constant technology has further branched out into other major industries across the world influencing fashion as well as culture and social aspects of everyday living. Zeki (2014) describes - in an interview with designer Tuba Ergin - of how the fashion world and technological world are becoming forever more 'harmonised' with each other, as well as how each compliment one another. Designer Ergin, showcased his designs at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Istanbul in 2014, which all included the new addition of circuit cards into each of his fashion garments including dresses and tops, and furthermore onto shoes and bags. Ergin (2014) mentions how each and every one of us now, as members of society, are fully under the influence of the sheer absorption of technology and this then further allows us to create an online identity. He even goes as far to state that &quot;I believe there is almost no difference between drug abuse and technology addiction&quot; [93] Such a statement allows us to see how we have fully established an online identity with our devices and the extent to which can be compared to such a heavily addictive substance such as drugs due to our online presence. In his interview, Ergin then goes on to discuss the developments of our devices that we are forever always using in our everyday lives such as technological glasses as well as watches. Such advances will allow us to grow our identities online even further. However, he then states that technology in the future will lead into clothes that can react to body temperature and the human pulse, such advancements will allow fitness merchandise to rocket, presumably.

===Marketing Industry===
Technological identity has had a massive influence over the business-orientated world. With people constantly being visible and in-corporated in their online world allows large businesses to make thousands of pounds from these users. The more people make themselves aware of being on their phones and technology devices, the more money companies make. Such large organisations such as Facebook allow their adverts to become more expensive and make great amounts of money on their customers simply through their use online being forever dominant in their world. Cookies and other internet bugs allow marketers to track every move we make online and more importantly, how long we are on a certain webpage for and where our mouse is hovering. Most importantly, our traits and how our personalities can be translated onto our online web activity.  Such details allow them to store great information on the everyday user and can show the extent to how intense the everyday person is identified and present online. Therefore, it is clear that marketers are cashing in on ourselves having a constant online visibility.

==Blended Identities==

Although the concept of blended identity has its roots in the field of social psychology, it has been appropriated by media theorists in recent years to describe a specific two-part process of identity creation which has been observed online everywhere from fan forums to dating websites &lt;ref&gt;Nolan, M. &amp; Rubenstein, K. (2009). ''Blended identification and its psychological consequences''. Retrieved 02/04/2014, from http://press.anu.edu.au/hrj/2009_01/mobile_devices/ch03s02.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Firstly, a user will create an online persona which blends various elements of their offline identity together with aspects of the online group or environment they have chosen to join. Secondly, when the user meets a person they originally met online in an offline setting; aspects of their online persona will filter back into their offline identity&lt;ref&gt;Baker, A. J. (2009). Mick or Keith: blended identity of online rock fans. ''Identity In The Information Society'', 2(1), 7-21. Doi: 10.1007/s12394-009-0015-5&lt;/ref&gt;.  

For many people, there are both positive and negative implications of blending their online and offline identities. On the positive front, blended identities can provide certain people with opportunities to express themselves in ways which they could not do in the offline world. For example, Natilene Bowker and Keith Tuffin believe that the amount of control that an individual can exert over their online identity can allow people with disabilities to cultivate a sense of identity, free from the constraints of the social stigmas that they face in the offline world. So, by taking certain aspects of their offline identities and blending them with an online world which “removes the ocularcentrism governing the way people interpret and evaluate others”, they can be judged in terms of their character rather than in terms of their particular disability&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, N. &amp; Tuffin, K. (2002). Disability Discourses for Online Identities, ''Disability &amp; Society'', 17(3), 327-344, Doi: 10.1080/09687590220139883&lt;/ref&gt;. 

However, on the negative front, the temptation for people to create idealised personas online means that the blending of identities can cause delusional behaviour to spill back over into their offline identities. As a person becomes more absorbed in their online identity and accustomed to the control that they have over it in terms of impression management, it can become more preferable for them to believe that it more accurately reflects who they are than their offline identity does. This can potentially cause tension and distress when they are forced to interact with people – friends and family members, for example - in an offline environment who are unaware of their online identities. 

===Blended Identities In Fan Communities===

Andrea J. Baker explores these ideas in relation to online fan culture her journal article: Mick or Keith: blended identity of online rock fans. Over a two year period, Baker studied members of various online fan forums for The Rolling Stones in both online and offline situations, in order to see how their online identities were constructed and how this influenced their offline identities. She found that the presentation of an online persona has three aspects: the username, the avatar and the manner in which the individual identifies with the object of their fandom&lt;ref&gt;Baker, A. J. (2009). Mick or Keith: blended identity of online rock fans. ''Identity In The Information Society'', 2(1), 7-21. Doi: 10.1007/s12394-009-0015-5&lt;/ref&gt;. 

====Study Findings====

Usernames typically reflected a users need to closely identify with the object of their fandom. Many users chose to name themselves after a song, a lyric or a nickname of one of the band members. Aside from this, users seemed to appreciate creativity in regards to username selection. While avatars can perform the same general purpose as a username, their primary function tended to be as pictorial indicators of status within the forum, as those who posted regularly often became identified by their avatar rather than the content of their usernames. Finally, all users were identified according to which member of the band they aligned themselves with. This was perhaps the most important factor, as it heavily influenced both username and avatar selection, as well as providing a limited insight into users’ character preferences. For example, users who identified with Mick Jagger tended to view him as being responsible and concerned. On the other hand, fans of Keith Richards saw Mick Jagger as being cold and controlling&lt;ref&gt;Baker, A. J. (2009). Mick or Keith: blended identity of online rock fans. ''Identity In The Information Society'', 2(1), 7-21. Doi: 10.1007/s12394-009-0015-5&lt;/ref&gt;.  

When Baker met the users she had been studying in an offline environment, she found that their online identities had profoundly influenced their offline identities; particularly in regards to behaviour.  It was noted that both online and offline, men generally try to identify with the band members by showing a deep interest in the music. For example, many male fans obsessively collected obscure recordings from live shows or old demo tapes and spend a large amount of time discussing the guitar playing of Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood online. Conversely, women were generally more focused on trying to bond with the band members. Baker gives one example of a female fan who insisted that she was the wife of guitarist, Ronnie Wood, both online and offline&lt;ref&gt;Baker, A. J. (2009). Mick or Keith: blended identity of online rock fans. ''Identity In The Information Society'', 2(1), 7-21. Doi: 10.1007/s12394-009-0015-5&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Secondly, those with particularly memorable usernames were often referred to by their online username in offline environments. Additionally, the online forum of which a fan was a member appeared to influence the way they dressed. Members of the Shattered forum dressed in bright green t-shirts that they made themselves, whereas fans from other groups tried to avoid wearing any clothes that would obviously mark them as fans of the group. Interestingly, those who had actually met the band before tended to fall into the latter group rather than the former. However, the most divisive issue was the extent to which users chose to embrace their role as fans in an offline environment. While some users were happy to display overtly ‘fan-like’ behaviour in public, others were embarrassed to admit to people – especially family – that they were members of an online fan forum&lt;ref&gt;Baker, A. J. (2009). Mick or Keith: blended identity of online rock fans. ''Identity In The Information Society'', 2(1), 7-21. Doi: 10.1007/s12394-009-0015-5&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Concerns====

Although Baker eventually concluded that more research into the effects of online identities on offline behaviour was needed, her study raises some interesting and concerning points about blended identities. It seems to be the case that the online aspects of a blended identity come to overshadow the offline ones. In the context of Baker’s study, this can be seen by the fact that forum users almost always came to be recognised by their usernames and avatars rather than by any particular aspect of their offline identities. Also, the forum community seemed more likely to judge a user’s character based upon the pre-existing stereotypes surrounding their favourite member of The Rolling Stones than by actually getting to know them.  Consequently, many users - especially those who did not post frequently - could find themselves being characterised by mass generalisations and the superficial features of their online identities.

The impact of becoming immersed in this type environment was apparent in the behaviour that filtered back into users’ offline identities. Many seemed to feel that it was necessary for them to act out their online identities in the offline world in order to feel like they were still part of the fan community.  People such as the woman who believed she was Ronnie Woods’ wife seemed to have had their offline identities subsumed by the sometimes bizarre online personas they had made for themselves. Meanwhile, on the other end of the spectrum, some people felt the need to hide any trace of their online identities and emphasize their offline identities for fear of being ridiculed by those outside the fan community. Therefore, it seems that although blending identities is a seemingly necessary part of being in an online community, people run the risk of losing their sense of self as they struggle to find the right balance between online and offline identities.

===Blended Identities in Online Dating===

Online dating is a good example of blending identity as often it involves both online and offline interaction. The idea is that the online and offline identities are to be similarly constructed, if not appear the same. One user is effectively judging another based on their profile page (which usually includes at least one photograph of themselves plus listed personality traits) contained on the dating website they are both using. Should one person find that they admire another's page, they may wish to contact them via a messaging service within the website or through an e-mail address or phone number visible on their profile page.

The intention of online dating is to seek out a potential partner, so should two users think that each other has potential they may wish to meet in a different social context i.e. offline (in the 'real world'). What the user generally hopes for is that the offline identity of their 'date' matches that of the online; for example, not to turn out to be older than they had represented themselves online, or of a different gender. This differs from fan communities as it is often preferred on dating websites that users display their real name and use a photograph of themselves as their profile picture so as not to mislead potential 'dates'.

===Multiple Identities===

The concept of multiple identities started with the first internet generation itself, looking back as far as the Cold War. In early internet culture there was a great desire to create a new self, whether it was simply create a unique username or creating a whole new persona. Forums and bulletin boards were popular outlets for people choosing to adopt a new persona in the early years of cyber culture.  Despite the adoption of nicknames and personas, there was still a strong personal connection and arguably a greater responsibility tied to the posts made. Services such as Usenet often had more in common with our modern SNSs, in the sense that many users went by their full name in addition to listing rather personal details such as their alma mater or even their home address (this being well before the advent of satnav and Google Maps, of course). 

People began to see computers as an escape from “official reality” says Proffesor of Media Geert Lovink in his critique of social media. He observes people realised they could “design futures, enhance bodies and extend minds.” &lt;ref&gt;Lovink, G. (2011) ''Networks Without a Cause: A Critique of Social Media'', (pp.39). Cambridge: Polity Press &lt;/ref&gt; In the late 80s and early 90s, when what we know today as the internet was still in a relatively embryonic state, many theorists took this idea of bodily enhancement and extension of the mind rather literally; with some raising the possibility of Virtual Reality forming a useful tool in future online communications. Despite perhaps not taking place in the way they had anticipated, their central idea was prescient, namely that the internet would form a means with which to collectively share, compile, edit, expand, and distribute information.

In contrast to popular opinion that social media has only further enforced the notion of multiple identities Lovink suggest Facebook emphasizes a commitment to the “real self”. &lt;ref&gt;Lovink, G. (2011) ''Networks Without a Cause: A Critique of Social Media'', Cambridge: Polity Press (pp.40). &lt;/ref&gt; He observes that this may be due to the feeling of being among friends on Facebook, it seems that Lovink believes the real has prevailed over the fake but also acknowledges this may have restricted our freedom online.  

Surrounding this subject founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg, controversially said: “Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity”. This entirely contradicts the influential beliefs of sociologist Erving Goffman who introduced the idea Dramaturgy, which argues that the elements of human interactions are dependent upon time, place, and audience.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, E. (1959) ''The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life'', New York: Anchor Books&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is still widely used in sociology and media studies today.

===Online Identities and Personality Disorders===

In 2002 Dr Adam Joinson put forward the theory that online participation allows people to pursue various forms of characterisation in order to gratify a range of audiences without causing conflict. &lt;ref&gt;Joinson, A. (2002) “Understanding the Psychology of Internet Behaviours: Virtual Worlds, Real Lives'', (pp.145-203). Oxford: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person might have a Facebook page that is suitable for their family and shows them behaving in a responsible and mature way. By on the other hand they may have another closed and private page which reveals a more wild personality which can be accessed by friends. This is done so that the person can explore their multiple personas with freedom, far from the fear of complaint and question.

Dr Joinson also speaks (on page 147) about a blogger called Rae-Rae Darron who has seven different blog sites. The person uses these different blogs to write about: celebrity culture, the concept of popular actors and singers versus talented actors and singers, fashion trends, local politics, the environment, natural science and evolution theories versus religion. Rae-Rae Darron did an interview with the magazine, “Wired,” in 2001 and explained that she had tried to have a blog page which explored all her areas of interest but was told that viewers were bored and unhappy about seeing such a mix and would rather have a page that was dedicated to one subject. Rae-Rae Darron then explained that she felt she could no longer express her holistic and broad personality, but had to box her interests in order to appeal to viewers with different interests and ideals.

In 2010 the incident of Rae-Rae Darron was revisited by psychologist James. F Masterson in a follow on book from his 1990 edition on personality disorders. &lt;ref&gt;Masterson, J.F. (1990 and 2011) “The Search for the Real Self: Unmasking the Personality Disorders of Our Age '', (pp.23-39). London: The Free Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Masterson argues that people have become so intent on making separate zones of performance on the internet that there is a danger of losing the reality of self. If a person spends so much energy into wearing different social masks, then they begin to forget which one is sincere and which one is most dominant or important. By turning away from the right to hold a natural and genuine personality which is constant in its strengths, weaknesses and individuality, then realism no longer exists and honest identities are no longer known resulting in confused personality disorders transferring from the internet into real life.

==Cultural Theories applied to Online Identity==

===Technological Determinism===

Although much of Marshall McLuhan's pioneering research into the subject of media theory was conducted during the early 1960's - a media landscape vastly different from today's - his ideas surrounding Technological Determinism have shaped how we understand media and are still drawn upon by contemporary theorists, such as Hamid van Koten, who applies McLuhan's theoretical frameworks to the subject of Online Identity in his book 'Digital Visual Culture: Theory and Practice'. In ’Understanding the Media: The Extensions of a Man’ McLuhan highlights the unidentified and almost unnoticeable power of technologies to transform and manipulate how one identifies ’the self’. Applying this idea to the subject of Online Identity, one might say that the main issue raised by the idea of a person having a distinct online persona and its importance to how people interact with each other and reflect on themselves is that it isn't fully – or maybe at all – in one’s control. McLuhan raises the question of whether computers extend to the human nervous system, gaining a control over how people perceive and use media without their notice.

===Cultural Determinism===

At the opposite end of the cultural theory spectrum is Raymond Williams, whose ideas on ’Cultural Determinism’, outlined in his book ''Television, Technology and Cultural Form'' have been critical to the formulation of the theory that it is not the medium itself that directly influences the behaviour of individuals, but the pre-existing social and cultural phenomena that were the catalysts for the medium's production. With this in mind, the idea of Online Identities being an integral part of many people's everyday lives can be linked to a user's pre-existing desire for it to exist; perhaps to increase chances of social interactions with others or for individuals to be able to experience life in a way that would be impossible while using their offline identity.

==Theorists==

==== Hamid Van Koten ====
 - ‘The Digital Image and the Pleasure Principle: The Consumption of Realism in the Age of Simulation’ 
Van Koten's main research questions illustrated in this paper come under:

'''·''' What are the forces at work in the production and consumption of digital representations? For example what makes digital gaming so popular?

'''·''' What are the narrative and representational issues involved, and what do these tell us about our culture and ourselves?

Specifically the paper seeks to uncover two themes: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative Narrative] and Realism as the dominant form of digital representations in terms of production, and the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lacan Lacanian] shift from the real to the imaginary as the dominant drive towards the consumption of these representations.

In his paper Von Koten argues that video games act as an outlet for forces within the collective subconscious, allowing what Jung called the animus and anima breathing space. Quite simply put, it provides an outlet for desires that we may be unable to realise or satisfy within the confines of “real life”. It could be said that the same is applicable to the internet and social media as a whole. In many cases this can be beneficial, as seen in the benevolence with which people help out or donate to causes that may be hundreds of miles away from them. On the other hand, some may use their online ability and the relative anonymity often comes with it for less-than-positive purposes, such as committing crimes or harassing other users.

Additionally, van Koten cites the work of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gerbner George Gerbner].

==== George Gerbner ====
Van Koten refers to a longitudinal study of television conducted by [[w:George_Gerbner|George Gerbner]] over the space of almost 30 years. Through his research he found that people's perceptions of their world are affected by their television viewing habits. e.g. those who were found to watch a large amount to television each week tended to view the world as a more violent place than it really was.

Gerbner supports the theory that film and television representations of gender, ethnic minority and power relationships are important factors for the construction and maintenance of a social identity in real life, and the same could be said about our construction of online identity. Hence, to a certain extent people model their personal and online personae on what they see portrayed to them through the media. However the counter argument to this is that what is portrayed in the media is constructed from pre-existent social values, attitudes and beliefs.

==== Jonathan Vanasco ====
 - 'Meta-Identities and Identity Facets'
Jonathan Vanasco delves into the idea of how within life people display different personas within separate social circles of their lives, whether it be with  their friends, family or colleagues. Vanasco argues that this is then reflected through our multiple online identities that we create e.g. using separate email addresses for different content (private, work, education etc). The same can be applicable when people use different SMSs in different ways while conforming to the conventions of that particular site (Facebook - professional, Instagram - creative, Snapchat - quirky). A detailed explanation of Vanasco's work can be found here -[http://www.destructuring.net/IdentityResearch/Essays/2007_11/01/2007-11-01--II_theory.html#id2 Vanasco's Theory]

===Jaron Lanier===

[[w:Jaron_Lanier|Jaron Lanier]] is important when looking at online identity. He was one of the original digital pioneers, however he is not a “leading-edge techno-enthusiast.”&lt;ref&gt;Gauntlett, D. (2011). ''Making Is Connecting: The Social Meaning of Creativity'', (pp.194). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''You Are Not A Gadget'' he discusses his worry about the particular ways in which the Web, in particular focusing on Facebook, has developed and what this means for online creativity and self-expression.

He argues that the HTML messy homepages of the 1990s were better than the ‘improvement’ of Facebook (where the result is nice neat sets of boxes of pictures and information.) He puts individual creativity and self-expression above all else, and therefore concludes that the diverse, handcrafted personal pages were much more preferable than “formulaic, template-driven expressions of identity pushed by Facebook.”&lt;ref&gt;Gauntlett, D. (2011). ''Making Is Connecting: The Social Meaning of Creativity'', (pp.195). Cambridge: Polity Press&lt;/ref&gt;  It did not matter that they were messy, had unexpected tones or lacked uniformity - it was their idiosyncratic nature that lent them a distinctly human touch, in strong contrast to the inflexible and sterile pages preferred by major modern SNSs.

Lanier argues that we should always be willing to spend a bit of time making personal representations of our identity and that we cannot allow ourselves to be reduced to a template. One of his key concerns is that digital systems reduce everything to simple bits of information so that they can be processed.&lt;ref&gt;Lanier, J. (2011). ''You Are Not A Gadget: A Manifesto'', (pp.68). London: Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt; He warns that when we reduce our humanity to fit the requirements of a machine we lose something of ourselves. He argues that whilst the uniform nature of Facebook profiles keep things simple and predictable, human beings are worth cherishing because of their distinctive and individual natures- not because they are simple and predictable.&lt;ref&gt;Lanier, J. (2011). ''You Are Not A Gadget: A Manifesto'', (pp.5). London: Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt; He further argues that Web 2.0 reduces individual creativity to general ‘mush’, causing a dilution and silence of individual voice in the name of collaboration.

===Marshall McLuhan===

[[w:Marshall_McLuhan|Marshall McLuhan]] is a key theorist in the subject of digital media and his main ideas derive from technological determinism. He once said that “the medium is the message”, a phrase which epitomises his approach towards technologies and their influence on society. McLuhan believed that all media is an extension of the human body that cause deep and lasting changes to his environment, describing this extension as being an &quot;amplification of an organ&quot;. &lt;ref&gt; &quot;Marshall McLuhan Playboy Interview, 1969&quot; by Phillip Rogaway http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/classes/188/spring07/mcluhan.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; This can be applied to online identity as our online selves can be seen as an extension of our current identities. Therefore, McLuhan's theory of technological determinism can be argued as being applicable to the concept of online identity. McLuhan also introduced the idea of Hot and Cold Media, with Hot media referring to that which involves a low level of participation (such as radio and cinema) and Cool media involving high participation (daily conversations, TV, phone services). However, due to continuous media convergence this becomes harder to apply to the internet and its related services.

===Zizi Papacharissi===

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizi_Papacharissi Zizi Papacharissi] is an academic whose work on online identity covers areas including communication technology and communication theory. Papacharissi is currently a Professor and Head of the Department of Communication at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Her work focuses on 'the social and political consequences of new media technologies'. 

Her work on the book 'A Networked Self' saw an investigation into the comparititive links between Facebook photo galleries and the user's online identities. The findings show that participants both knowingly and unknowingly seek to define and refine a positive view of themselves through impression management, done through the constant updating of SNS and profile pictures. '''See Profile Pictures Below for more information.'''

===JJ Wright===

JJ Wright, interested in the effects that online activity can have on a person’s identity, asks whether “the field of cyberspace/online activity is complicating or simplifying identity and communications&quot;? He of course answers “both” as online presence has both a complicating and simplifying effect on human identity.
He argues that back in the day, before the global village, in a time without modern technology and without the web which holds our precious social networking sites, identity was easily defined via the physical traits that a person held. 
•	Gender
•	Race
•	Ethnicity
•	Age
•	Weight. These traits which individuals had in common with one another collectively came together to create shared identities. Now however, people are more concentred with individual identity and with complete access to an online world, which offers an endless amount of possibilities when it comes to changing one’s self, it is much easier for people to control their individual identity’s and keep on top of them as they filter what others may see about them online. 

While it is very common for individuals to often dabble a little in altering or changing ones online identity, like those of whom gender swap when using online realities such as Second Life or playing online games such World of Warcraft (WOW), on the whole it is thought that individuals tend to rather be more open about themselves, in a sense becoming public online, than they would be offline. 
The reason for this is that there is a lower risk of negative reaction when socialising or sharing things about yourself online. Individuals may also experience less judgment online of their real characteristics such as race, religion or age, and so in turn be more inclined to share things about their identity which have no relevance to their physical characteristics and thus improving or building on their ''“project of self”.''

A persons ''“project of self”'' is essentially ones on going and changing identity. JJ Wright argues that we take our offline identities to online and our online ones to offline which of course all add to our ''&quot;project of self&quot;''. For JJ Wright, all the internet does is offers us the chance to break down the barriers which may prevent us from interaction in the real world and become the internet makes this possible it means that people can play with their identities in a way which may have no real negative impact on their offline life’s. The internet then offers a sphere for interaction without judgment of physical characteristics which may have prevented face to face communication. &lt;ref&gt; http://g.virbcdn.com/_f/files/46/FileItem-266593-EvolutionTrendsPresentPaper.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of an 'always-on' culture is that we are constantly connected and networked, even when we are not physically using our phones or computers. We are &quot;tethered&quot; to the technology we consume; technology has become a part of us that we cannot escape from.

In an 'always-on' culture, we think of the implied blurring of the lines between our public and private lives. There can be an inability to escape the need to check social media platforms or the internet in general, even in situations when it could be considered rude or inappropriate. Some people have developed a need to incessantly, and compulsively, be contactable due to this culture. Snapping that connection can result in anxiety among other negative side effects consistent with an addict going through withdrawal. Other negative effects can come from our growing connection including online dis-inhibition, reduced social context cues, privacy issues, and other factors. However, we can't always turn ourselves 'off'. Everyday life is saturated with technology and media and the benefits it brings. The value of instant communication and the wealth of information are just two of many reasons that our culture's direction isn't necessarily a wrong one. 

Voices from theorists including danah boyd, Sherry Turkle, Leslie Perlow, and Naomi Baron become significant when discussing 'always-on' culture. Their ideas provide a foundation for analysing technology and media's place in our culture and how our daily lives have changed living in an 'always-on' culture.

==Main Concepts==
=== 'Always-On' ===



The term 'always-on' is used to refer to the way modern technology (mobile phones, computers, etc.) continuously keeps people connected to each other through the Internet, and therefore always accessible. Sherry Turkle, a prominent theorist who's work analyzes our relationship with technology, suggests that people have become so tethered with their 'always-on' communication devices that the self has become attached to the devices so much that life can be represented by the digital screens we keep in our pockets&lt;ref&gt;Katz, J. E. (2008). Handbook of mobile communication studies. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press. Sherry Turkle, 'Always-on/Always-on-you: The tethered Self'&lt;/ref&gt;.

Others theorists, such as danah boyd, have a more positive perspective. They claim that the online world is always just around the corner, and that the online world does not necessarily have to be a bad thing. boyd says that most people are 'always-on' without technology being the center of the activity and that &quot;there is no longer about on or off. It's about living in a world where being networked to people and information wherever and whenever you need it is just assumed&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mandiberg, M. (2012). The social media reader. New York: New York University Press. danah boyd, pp.71--76&lt;/ref&gt;. If people in some way are connected to the network, through a mobile phone, a computer, gaming console etc., they are considered to be 'always-on.' However, this constant connection does not mean that users must always pay attention to that connection.

While boyd makes a valid point to say that our online lives are as ‘real’ as our offline lives, more could be said about the significant difference between these two aspects of our lives, in particular how we behave online versus how we behave offline. Suler makes the point that when we communicate online, our input comes after some delay, perhaps minutes, hours or even days, and this affects what we say, in text form, and how we say it&lt;ref&gt;Suler, J. (2005). The online disinhibition effect. International Journal Of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, 2 (2), pp. 184--188&lt;/ref&gt;. Importantly, he asserts that when we communicate face-to-face with others, “moment-by-moment responses between people powerfully shapes the ongoing flow of self-disclosure, usually in the direction of conforming to social norms”&lt;ref&gt;Suler, J. (2005). The online disinhibition effect. International Journal Of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, 2 (2), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;. If this is the case and an increasing amount of our time is spent online, this could perhaps leave some people struggling with the face-to-face social skills necessary to fit in to a particular environment. Such as that of an organisation with a clear expectation of cultural behaviour, or to succeed in particular roles where face-to-face interaction with people is necessary.

==='Always-On': The Different Means of Getting Connected===


Being ‘always-on’, according to danah boyd, means taking into account both technical networks and social networks. When we cannot connect to the technical network we can often feel frustrated, angry, or worried that we can’t get access to a particular piece of information, or that our productivity will fall, or we can’t make a particular social connection at that precise point in time &lt;ref&gt; boyd, d. (2012). 'Participating Always-On Lifestyle' from Michael Mandiberg (ed.) The Social Media Reader, New York University Press,p.71-76 &lt;/ref&gt;. This section looks briefly at the how the internet developed and the legacy issues from that development, the technical network today and how each part has advantages and disadvantages.

===The Mobile Device===

Recent advancements in general technology have affronted media in such a way that it is now more accessible to people than ever. The developments in the mobile phone as a device have been testament to this, as within the past 10 years more and more technology has been added to the mobile device itself allowing more functions to be used. The mobile phone is no longer just a phone - cameras to film and photograph, games, app storage, social media, email, GPS capabilities, information storage etc, and quite importantly, mobile internet access - creating a handheld computer. The concept of being able to connect to the Internet wirelessly on such a portable level is an important and pivotal factor in regards to this 'always-on' culture.

'''The Smart Phone'''

The invention of the smartphone has been quite possibly the most important development in terms of thinking about this 'always-on' culture. It is these devices to which theorists refer to when discussing how we are connected and 'tethered' and are responsible for the ability to stay connected to various medias as mobile phones have been developed to do more than just facilitate calls. 

'''The Tablet'''

Recently, tablet devices have been growing in popularity, combining the portability of the smartphone and the larger screen of a laptop.

====Origins of the Internet and its Legacy====

The Internet’s origin began in the 1960s with a network created by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency Advanced Research Projects Agency] which was part of the US Defense department. It was called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET ARPANET] and was originally designed to connect universities and laboratories &lt;ref&gt; IEEE. (2014). The Fathers of the Internet Retrieved 03/27 2014, from http://theinstitute.ieee.org/people/achievements/the-fathers-of-the-internet &lt;/ref&gt;. Many other networks were subsequently created in different organizations and  countries, but the networks themselves could not effectively interconnect (BBC, 2012). In 1974 [http://research.google.com/pubs/author32412.html Vint Cerf]and [http://www.computerhistory.org/fellowawards/hall/bios/Robert,Kahn/ Robert Kahn]wrote communication protocols to enable information to be easily sent from one network to another, and this was published in May 1974. The protocols they wrote were called TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) and now form the protocols that run the internet &lt;ref&gt; IEEE. (2014). The Fathers of the Internet Retrieved 03/27 2014, from http://theinstitute.ieee.org/people/achievements/the-fathers-of-the-internet &lt;/ref&gt;. Despite the clear benefits at the time of allowing the internet to flourish, TCP/IP might now be categorized as a ‘Lock-in’ as described by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier Jaron Lanier] &lt;ref&gt; Lanier, J.(2011). You Are Not A Gadget. Penguin: London &lt;/ref&gt;, and we are now somewhat constrained by a major tool we use to understand the world.

====Future Direction====
The advance towards true 'always-on' connectivity globally, and in particular wireless connectivity, has recently been the subject of intent from two of the world's largest technology companies: Google and Facebook. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg Mark Zuckerberg], CEO of Facebook, announced that he has plans to expand the boundaries of the Internet to ensure every person in the globe has affordable, basic access to internet services. He expects to do so through the use of wireless drones, satellites, and lasers, thus creating a fully 'always-on' world &lt;ref&gt; Pimentel, B. (2014).

===Participants in an 'Always-On' Culture===

====Youth: Unplugged====

[[File:Japanese teenager with her mobile phone.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese teenager with her mobile phone|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=A]]

One of the most obvious and commonly considered victims of an 'always-on' culture are the younger generations, always on their phone or with multiple social media profiles online that need constant attention. This links back to the idea of their [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Media_and_Culture_Yearbook_2014/Chapter_2:_Online_Identity#Social_Networking_Sites Online Identity].

Retrieved from http://vimeo.com/86023743 &lt;/ref&gt; Ten years ago, a twelve-year-old would never have had a mobile phone, let alone using several social media platforms such as Facebook or YouTube. Now, twelve-year-olds have the latest mobile phone and can likely work it better than their parents. Unplugging a young adult evokes feelings similar to an addict going through withdrawal and depression. &lt;ref&gt; Alleyne, R. (2011) The young generation are addicted to mobile phones. Retrieved from http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/8458786/The-young-generation-are-addicted-to-mobile-phones.html &lt;/ref&gt; Unplugging oneself is not as easy as turning off a phone.

Retrieved from http://www.elon.edu/e-web/predictions/expertsurveys/2012survey/future_generation_AO_2020.xhtml &lt;/ref&gt; Thus is it understandable, and frankly unavoidable, that young people are a major part of the growing 'always-on' culture. 

=====Unplugged: The Study===== 

A 2010 study had 200 University of Maryland (USA) students go without all forms of media, including non-technological media, for 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Moeller, S. D. (2010). A Day Without Media | Research conducted by ICMPA and students at the Phillip Merrill College of Journalism, University of Maryland, College Park, USA. Retrieved from http://withoutmedia.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt; After 24 hours, students logged onto class blogs and reported their successes, or, in many cases, failures. The results of the study were definitive: mobile technology not only changed students' relationships with the news and access to information but also had a profound impact on their relationships with friends and family. The study concludes that constant connection to media has caused students to make different social and moral decisions with their 24 hours than if they had spent the day surrounded by their average collection of media outlets (withoutmedia, 2010). 

Severing the students' tether to technology created feelings similar to those of an addict going through depression and separation anxiety. Some students claimed that they had feelings similar to &quot;[http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/87/1/107.long phantom limb pain]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nikolajsen, L., &amp; Jensen, T. S. (2001). Phantom limb pain. Retrieved from http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/87/1/107.long&lt;/ref&gt; experienced often by disabled war veterans. Students found themselves twitching towards their iPods or feeling their back pockets for their phone before realizing they were doing it. After physically removing themselves from technology and media, they found that they couldn't mentally separate from it. Media dependency had become a habit. A student participant from the study said the following:
{{quotation |“A few hours later, I brushed my teeth, came back to my room, opened my laptop, and got on Facebook.

Media dependency | A Day Without Media. Retrieved from http://withoutmedia.wordpress.com/study-conclusions/dependence/&lt;/ref&gt; }}

A question remains - do those in an 'always-on' culture live a richer life or those who remain disconnected? A few voices from the study say that &quot;I believe that those who are not tied to this system are missing something... they are missing information.” (withoutmedia, 2010). Information itself is a commodity that people collect, trade, and put value in. Those who have a constant connection to media possess more information than others and therefore become &quot;richer&quot;. Without certain information or internet access the world becomes much smaller. It could take several weeks to learn about the [http://edition.cnn.com/2014/04/01/world/americas/chile-earthquake/ 8.2 magnitude earthquake that struck Chile] April 2nd, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, D., &amp; Ahmed, S.

Internet is out, as is television and newspapers. Face-to-face would remain the most reliable transfer of information but the earthquake news would be dated and limited to those who physically heard it from the source. One student commented that, “Those who aren't connected through media probably have no idea about certain things going on in the world,” (withoutmedia, 2010).

===Part of 'The Network'===
boyd talks of 'the network'; the particular platform (out of thousands available) online users utilize to connect with people who have similar interests and aspirations, in order to achieve a common goal/objective&lt;ref&gt;boyd, d (2012) 'Participating in the Always-On Culture' in The Social Media Reader&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead of 'tethering' being an addiction, it is instead a practical evolutionary step building upon humanity's natural social requirements and curiosity&lt;ref&gt;boyd, d (2012) 'Participating in the Always-On Culture' in The Social Media Reader&lt;/ref&gt;. Most of our networks are personalized, and we only interact with those we wish to interact with (the exceptions being trolls and hackers)&lt;ref&gt;boyd, d (2012) 'Participating in the Always-On Culture' in The Social Media Reader&lt;/ref&gt;. This means that people wish to be 'always-on' in order to continuously develop and progress - as interaction with like-minded individuals can further our own ends and development&lt;ref&gt;boyd, d (2012) 'Participating in the Always-On Culture' in The Social Media Reader&lt;/ref&gt;:

:''&quot;Many who blog and tweet are not writing for the world at large; they are writing for the small group who might find it relevant and meaningful. And, realistically, the world at large is not reading the details of their lives. Instead, they are taking advantage of the affordances of these technologies to connect with others in a way that they feel is appropriate&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;boyd, d (2012) 'Participating in the Always-On Culture' in The Social Media Reader&lt;/ref&gt;.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier Jaron Lanier] calls the 'network' the 'tribe':

:''&quot;The central mistake of recent digital culture is to chop up a network of individuals so finely that you end up with mush. You then start to care about the abstraction of the network more than the real people who are networked, even though the network by itself is meaningless. [...] The members of the tribe are my lifelong friends, my mentors, my students, my colleagues and my fellow travelers.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Lanier, J. (2010) 'You Are Not A Gadget', London: Penguin Books Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;.

Lanier talks here about the different groups of people that participate in this 'always-on' culture. A common thought is that the majority of this network are teenagers: 

:''&quot;So immersed were these young people in their social networks that the idea of being unavailable, even for an instant, was unimaginable.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt; Gots, J. (2012). Switching Off an &quot;Always-On&quot; Culture. Retrieved from think-tank/switching-off-an-always-on-culture &lt;/ref&gt;

This idea of teens being totally involved in the network is a popular one, however, as Lanier stated above, they are not the only people. More and more workplaces expect their employees to be 'always-on', to be part of the network with their other colleagues in order to work to their full potential. In order for them to achieve this, they have to be networked to each other, it will get their work done in a much more timely and efficient manner. 

It is with these opinions that being 'always-on' is viewed as a positive measure, as realistically humans do not have the capacity to be 'always-on' to everything the internet has to offer. Thus we restrict what we are 'always-on' to - to things that solely benefit us&lt;ref&gt;boyd, d (2012) 'Participating in the Always-On Culture' in The Social Media Reader&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite this perceived restriction on the 'network', Fowler &amp; Christakis note that increased involvement within a network (particularly one based around social media) yields positive benefits to the individual through ''situational inequality'' and ''positional inequality''. Using the example of loneliness, on average people are lonely for 48 days of the year, but for every extra friend within an individual's 'network' the number of lonely days per year is judged to decrease by almost two days&lt;ref&gt;Christakis, N. and Fowler, J. (2011) 'Connected - The Amazing Power of Social networks and How They Shape Our Lives', London: Harper Press&lt;/ref&gt;. This is an example of ''positional inequality'' positively effecting an individual in the form of ''situational inequality'', demonstrating boyd's notion that being 'always-on' to the 'network' yields positive results.       

However, views on the concept differ, with even initial supporters highlighting negative issues resulting from being 'always-on'. It can be argued that Fowler &amp; Christakis' view shows that instead of willingly being 'always-on' to the 'network', individuals are coerced into participation out of fear of the adverse consequences associated with being disconnected - ''&quot;loneliness [...] a cause and a consequence of becoming disconnected&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Christakis, N. and Fowler, J. (2011) 'Connected - The Amazing Power of Social networks and How They Shape Our Lives', London: Harper Press&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, in a study by Eastin and LaRose&lt;ref&gt;Eastin, M. and LaRose, R. (2000) 'Internet Self-Efficacy and the Psychology of the Digital Divide' in Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication&lt;/ref&gt; , it was observed that there was a spike in levels of depression among individuals who experience 'Internet Stress', such as being unable to establish a a solid connection. The impact is decidedly negative, and could raise the argument that the 'always-on' culture has caused an overall increase in anxiety and depression by its ability to give more chances for people to experience this form of 'Internet Stress'. It has also been noted that 'always-on' culture could eventually develop into a component of the 'locked in' theory, forcing humans to rely even more greatly on technology, even for simple social contact&lt;ref&gt;Lanier, J. (2010) 'You Are Not A Gadget', London: Penguin Books Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to these theories, because individual's are forced to utilize the 'network' during their free time (due to job and family commitments), it has also been noted that being 'always-on' increases anxiety levels and is a large contributor to disrupted sleeping patterns&lt;ref&gt;boyd, d (2012) 'Participating in the Always-On Culture' in The Social Media Reader&lt;/ref&gt;. From this it has been identified that 'always-on' culture, at this point, has been neither fully researched nor fully understood.

==='Tethering'===

One of the main concepts focused on within 'always-on' discussion is the idea that we are tethered to our technological devices. Academic Sherry Turkle coins the term in her discussion of the growing 'always-on' culture. She describes  the concept of a 'Tethered self' as the idea of people being consistently accessible through technology and our expectations for them to always be contactable. She explores how even when not physically using our phones or social networking we are still contactable through them, therefore we are forever linked to our communication outlets. &lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. (2011). Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less From Each Other, New York: Basic Books &lt;/ref&gt;
. In her piece &quot;Always-On/Always-On-You: The Tethered Self,&quot; Turkle looks at how technology has changed the social acceptability of being disengaged with the people in your physical space and more connected with people miles away. The idea of being tethered to a device raises issues on our increasing reliance on the technology we use &lt;ref&gt; Turkle, S.(2008). Always-On/Always-On-You: The Tethered Self. from Katz, J E., Handbook of Mobile Communication Studies. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press &lt;/ref&gt;. We expect our technology to always work and for others to be immediately responsive, however if the technology breaks or people do not responded we panic. Throughout the working world, staff are expected to be constantly accessible, to the extent that if they are not &quot;on&quot; there is potential for them losing their job. &lt;ref&gt; Gots, J. (2012). Switching Off an &quot;Always-On&quot; Culture. Retrieved from think-tank/switching-off-an-always-on-culture &lt;/ref&gt; Academic danah boyd comments that &quot;It's no longer about on or off, really. It's about living in a world where being networked to people and information wherever and whenever you need is just assumed&quot; &lt;ref&gt; boyd, d. (2012). 'Participating Always-On Lifestyle' from Michael Mandiberg (ed.) The Social Media Reader, New York University Press,p.71-76 &lt;/ref&gt;.

According to Turkle, the idea of the 'Tethered Self' brings up the issue of boundaries; &quot;a parent, partner, or child can be lost for a few seconds or a few minutes to an alternative reality&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Turkle, S.(2008). Always-On/Always-On-You: The Tethered Self. from Katz, J E., Handbook of Mobile Communication Studies. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press &lt;/ref&gt;. People are having to draw clear lines as to when they are present in the physical space around them and when they are 'on' or connected to other people and spaces. Instead of being a natural act, turning of has to be a conscious decision made by the user.

Acknowledging our tethered state raises the question of to whom or to what we are connected &lt;ref&gt;Katz, J. E. (2008). Handbook of mobile communication studies. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
With the ever-growing state of convergence in technological advancements we are starting to see a change in the way we interact with humans. We are tethered to a completely different community in the 21st century. We are not restricted to being tied to only family and friends via local telephone, the Internet has enabled a broader array of contacting. With the growth of technology the 'always-on' culture has grown, we are always connected to the Internet, we can phone people all around the world; we are always tethered.

Tethering is not simply about one's own choice to be connected through the 'main' social media (text, email, Facebook, Twitter). It has been suggested by researcher [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavoj_Zizek Slavoj Žižek] in his work &quot;Big Brother, or The triumph of the Gaze Over the Eye&quot; that in our modern society, anxiety is more likely to arise through not being accessible or existing in this online sense. This has resulted in it becoming something of an oddity for someone to be outside of these online platforms, and socially surreal.

As Žižek points out, the culture of 'always-on' has made some people act in bizarrely voyeuristic ways - almost as if they were broadcasting their entire lives as a reality show. He compares aspects of the use of social media to the presentation of the film ''The Truman Show'' and the reality television series ''Big Brother'', in terms of the manner in which people are almost utilizing themselves as actors, casting forth an image of themselves to formulate an impression of themselves for others to digest &lt;ref&gt; Žižek, S. (2002). Big Brother, or The triumph of the Gaze Over the Eye from Ctrl Space, London: MIT Press &lt;/ref&gt;. This includes occasionally detailing processes of life that would be usually deemed unworthy of note, simply because it seems to be expected of oneself to do so.

'Always-on' culture and tethering can be seen as causing crucial problems for businesses. In correlation with people having expectations of their own technology always working we have the same expectation for the technologies of companies. This causes companies who suffer from unexpected technological failures to lose money and reputation as a result. For example in February last year a crash of the Bank of America's online banking system caused disruptions for numerous customers wanting to check their finances at the start of the month. The customers were seen to later vent their frustrations to social media sites. &lt;ref&gt; Seddon, C and Issac, D. (2013). The business implications of an 'Always-on' Technology Culture. Dealing with a new era of it outages.. Retrieved from http://www.pinsentmasons.com/PDF/TMTInsightsummer.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;. Hence the company's reputation was hurt due to unavoidable technological failures due to their customers reliance on being 'always-on'. On the other hand if businesses were to reject the use of social media they would inevitably lose out in publicity to other more vocal companies, or be seen as outdated for not utilizing new technology. 

Besides tethering affecting businesses, it is also contributing to an ever-growing issue of internet addiction disorder, giving ease of use to to people to connect to the Internet, anywhere and anytime. &quot;IAD was originally proposed as a disorder in a satirical hoax by Ivan Goldberg, M.D., in 1995, though some later researchers have taken his essay seriously.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_addiction_disorder#Problematic_Internet_Use_.28PRIUSS.29&lt;/ref&gt; This is the results of the 'always-on' culture, addiction, a severe mental disorder. As Sherry Turkle mentions in 'Connected but alone?'  ‘[...]those little devices in our pockets are so psychologically-powerful, that they don’t only change what we do – they change who we are.’ &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/sherry_turkle_alone_together?source=facebook&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently showing you the power of technological convergence, tethering and the internet's effect on the 21st century.

====Tethered to the Workplace====

Just as the younger generations have an inescapable tie to technology, adults in the workplace are finding it just as hard to tear themselves away from their work once 5'o'clock rolls around. Meeting memos, online calendar appointment books, stock market app live updates, and the constant flurry of work emails make it impossible for workers to leave work at the office. Everyone is expected to be 'always-on' as a next-day meeting could be announced via email that was sent out during dinnertime. Expectations have changed. Workers are often required to always be connected to media to learn the latest news or even just to stay updated with company happening. A [http://www.apaexcellence.org/assets/general/2013-work-and-communication-technology-survey-final.pdf recent study] done by the American Psychological Association (APA) discovered that more than half of employed adults said they check work messages at least once a day over the weekend and outside week work hours. More than 4 in 10 workers reported doing the same while on vacation. In the same study, adults reported that being 'always-on' increased their workload by a third as more work could be done faster and from anywhere. Stepping out of the office doesn't include the mobile phone in the jacket pocket or the work laptop in the briefcase in hand. 

The APA suggests a few tips for unplugging for the day from the office, but it's the case of easier said than done. A few tips include managing expectations, setting boundaries, limiting multitasking, and turning work media off after work hours. For many companies out there, this isn't possible. Workers are hired with the knowledge that a 40-hour, 8-to-5 work week is a dream. Employees may not be strictly required to be &quot;on call&quot; 24/7 but the expectation might be set by employers.  

Small business owners also struggle with the demands to remain 'always-on'. In this age, many store owners need an online presence to attract business, even Facebook profiles to send out updates or even to post store hours. A [http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/231515 recent LinkedIn study] found that 81% of sampling of small businesses use social media to drive growth. YellowPages have moved online and businesses follow. Often, resources and time are thin when it comes to maintaining, or even creating, an online presence. Websites are difficult to set up and look appealing so many people opt to make social media profiles as a marketing tool in addition to an online presence itself, [http://www.forbes.com/sites/thesba/2013/11/25/how-much-is-online-presence-helping-small-business/ (Forbes, 2013)]. An online presence can connect business with a large number of potential consumers with very little effort.

==='Online Dis-inhibition'===
Another main concept within 'always-on' is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect online dis-inhibition]. The process of online dis-inhibition is described as the phenomenon of online users posting comments or discussions which they would be unlikely to say in real life. Users are seen to lose sense of some of their real world inhibitions that would dictate what to say in their offline conversations.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Suler John Suler], a Psychology Professor based at Rider University specialises in online dis-inhibition. He explains that they can be split between 'Benign dis-inhibition' and 'Toxic dis-inhibition' &lt;ref&gt; Suler, J. (2005). The Online Disinhibition Effect from International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, Vol. 2, No. 2: 184-188 &lt;/ref&gt;. 

====Benign Dis-inhibition====  
Often, benign dis-inhibition can be seen as an extension of online dis-inhibition where the online user can express emotions of sincerity and affection. Benign dis-inhibition was described by Suler in its simplest terms as ''an attempt to better understand and develop oneself. &lt;ref&gt; Suler, J. (2005). The Online Disinhibition Effect from International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, Vol. 2, No. 2: 184-188 &lt;/ref&gt;'' Behaviours can include sharing secrets and revealing more of themselves online than they would confide in a friend. Often online blog sites and chatrooms, such as Tumblr, keep users relatively anonymous and, as such, users feel more open to sharing pieces of themselves or acting kindly towards others. However, the same anonymity that allows users the privacy to share such thoughts also can lead to more destructive behaviors and actions. 

====Toxic Dis-inhibition====  
Similar to benign dis-inhibition, toxic dis-inhibition can be viewed as an extension to the idea of online dis-inhibitions. However, in contrast to benign dis-inhibition, toxic dis-inhibition is the act of users spreading negative views and expressions online including social platforms and blogs. Such acts have recently been taken very seriously and as a result, many online laws and legislations have had to be changed. Toxic dis-inhibition can be linked to social media, particularly Tumblr, Twitter and ask.fm. These sites have been in the media a lot recently as stories relating to toxic dis-inhibition have brought the serious consequences of the issue - such as cyber-bullying - into public consciousness. Cyberbullying has become a recent trend in middle and high schools with the explosion of the internet and an addiction to technology. Children and teens don't have as much supervision on the internet and feel more anonymous. The only requirement for many social media sites is an email address which can be faked easily. Cyberbulling has been shown to have disastrous effects, making kids become depressed and withdraw, and in some extreme circumstances, driven students to suicide. &lt;ref&gt;Amichai-Hamburger, Y. (2013). The social net: Understanding our online behavior. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to benign dis-inhibition, Suler has simplified the idea to its base meaning of ''&quot;a blind catharsis, a fruitless repetition compulsion or acting out of pathological needs without any beneficial psychology change. &lt;ref&gt; Suler, J. (2005). The Online Disinhibition Effect from International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, Vol. 2, No. 2: 184-188 &lt;/ref&gt;&quot;''

====Popular Examples of Online Dis-inhibition====
One oft-acknowledged example of dis-inhibition affecting a large online populace is with the community surrounding Chatroulette. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatroulette Chatroulette] is a webcam-based chat service that connects the user randomly to another user, often from a pool of several million potential users who are online at any one time, anywhere in the world. The website receives little to no moderation, so if one connects to others on Chatroulette, there is no possible way to identify who they are about to connect with. Furthermore, the website utilises anonymous connections for all of its users, and as such, extreme or otherwise hurtful things are displayed on Chatroulette with some degree of frequency&lt;ref&gt;Singh, G. (2014). ‘Always-on Culture’, lecture at University of Stirling, 4th March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;. This would point to the dis-inhibition of Chatroulette being easily categorised as toxic. Since the user is anonymous and randomly connected to another person anywhere in the world, often times people using the service will act in bizarre or lewd ways (including expressing themselves violently with with a great degree of explicitly sexual content).

A well known example of toxic dis-inhibition was the volatile reception Rebecca Black's 2011 song &quot;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0 Friday]&quot;. After her music video went viral, Black started to receive death threats from members of the public. Black had to be taken out of school to be taught at home by her mother due to the extent of her bullying. &lt;ref&gt; BBC Newsbeat (2011). Rebecca Black to be home-schooled after being bullied. Retrieved from http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/14488181 &lt;/ref&gt; Of course, threatening the life of an innocent 13 year old girl is unacceptable and the California Police Department had to make investigations. &lt;ref&gt; Wright, D. (2011). Rebecca Black &quot;Friday&quot; Singer, Receiving Death Threats. Retrieved from http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/rebecca-black-friday-singer-receiving-death-threats/story?id=13425921 &lt;/ref&gt; However they never discovered who was behind it, thus re-iterating the idea that people believe that they can say whatever they want online and they will not get caught.

Another example of online dis-inhibition was the &quot;Twitter joke trial&quot; of Paul Chambers in 2010. After discovering that his local airport was closed a week before he had to fly, he posted this tweet: ''&quot;Crap! Robin Hood airport is closed. You've got a week and a bit to get your s*** together otherwise I'm blowing the airport sky high!!&quot;'' He was arrested and fined for threatening the airport and consequently lost his job. He was granted an appeal in 2012 &lt;ref&gt; The Guardian. (2012). Twitter joke trail: Paul Chambers Wins High Court Appeal Against Conviction.

==='Reduced Social Context Cues'===
[http://people.stern.nyu.edu/lsproull/ Sproull] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Kiesler Kesler] (1986) and reduced social context cues. Sproull and Kesler argue that email and social networking, two main means of communication in 'always-on' culture, are of a low fidelity CMC. A low fidelity CMC meaning a low number of social context cues. With email, texts or social networks we are limited to text based communication where we lose out on people's expressions and immediate responses to information. They argue this mode of communication will lead to people becoming more self absorbed in communications since they don't have the other person physically present. Particularly with 'always-on' culture, people online can be seen to get annoyed at slow responses to communication despite the recipient potentially being too busy to respond, since there is no way to know why they recipient isn't responding. &lt;ref&gt; Sproull, L. and Kiesler, S. (1986). Reducing Social Context Cues: Electronic Mail in Organizational Communication from Management Science, vol.32(no.11), 1492-1512 &lt;/ref&gt; Communication such as jokes or sarcasm will also be comparatively more difficult to read leading to potentially misread situations. However with the increasing use of communication in the form of video chatting we are seeing higher fidelity means of communication, therefore this issue can be seen as becoming less of a concern. That being said taking reduced social cues on a larger scale not seeing people's reactions can lead users to post rude or hurtful posts to celebrities or on YouTube comments, because they see no obvious repercussion of doing so. This phenomenon is unlikely to change due to higher fidelity video chatting as this tends to only occur between people who already know each other. As opposed to between audiences and you tubers, celebrities etc.

===Determinism===
====Technological Determinism====
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_determinism Technological determinism], also known as hard determinism, is the idea that technology has important effects on our lives. The term was first coined by the American sociologist [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorstein_Veblen Thorstein Veblen], who theorised that technology was the driving force behind social change and influences how cultures develop and grow in response to technology and its constant development. This theory argues that technology drives history and becomes determinant at a certain stage in its own history. It refers to how technology is responsible for the formation of new social and cultural conventions, establishing how we live our lives as we adapt and change around these technologies. For example, the development of mobile technology has increased many peoples accessibility to social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, because of this increased accessibility through these advancements, online interaction between people has increased considerably and new conventions regarding society and social media have been formed. It has been argued by Dovey and Giddlings (2008) that the idea of technological determinism figures prominently in the popular imagination and political rhetoric&lt;ref&gt;Lister, M., Dovey, J., Giddings, S., Grant, I. &amp; Kelly, K. (2008). New Media: A Critical Introduction. 2nd ed. London: Taylor And Francis&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Cultural Determinism====
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_determinism Cultural determinism], also known as soft determinism, is the idea that technology itself does not have an important effect in peoples lives, but rather people make technology important. This means that human agents intend to make technology an important part of their life&lt;ref&gt; Lister, M., Dovey, J., Giddings, S., Grant, I. &amp; Kelly, K. (2008). New Media: A Critical Introduction. 2nd ed. London: Taylor And Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to these ideas, being raised in a technology-saturate environment will have a significant fact on the current generations and amplified effects for generations to come as technology develops. By 1990, a large number of adults had mobile phones. In 2005, most teenagers had the same technology, but with more features in a smaller package. In 2014, many children have listed the latest smartphone on their Christmas lists. Technology and media play a role in a developing mind's emotional maturity, interpersonal communication skills, and other behaviors that will change as technology plays an even bigger role in our lives than it does now.

===Low Fidelity/High Fidelity===

Examples of &quot;Low fidelity&quot; communications are ones which are solely text-based or voice-based. Low fidelity is characterised by the lack of interpersonal and social context cues which determine how an individual feels or expresses their opinion. For example, text-based communications can lose the intended meaning depending on how the receiver interprets it. Different emphasis on certain words can change the importance significantly. Voice-based communications are of a slightly higher fidelity, but they lack facial expressions which are a clear indicator of one's position on a matter&lt;ref&gt;Sproull, L. &amp; Kiesler, S. (1986). Reducing social context cues: Electronic mail in organizational communication. Management Science, 32 (11), pp. 1492--1512&lt;/ref&gt;.
[[File:Video Call.jpg|thumb|left|Video call between Sweden and Singapore]]

Communicating with strangers without face-to-face cues also may lead to the reader subconsciously creating a voice and/or visual image for the other person conducted from their own imagination. This, in turn, will create a different version of the person which the user is communicating with based on his/hers individual desires and needs. Thus, the &quot;reality&quot; of these types of conversations may be distorted and develop into a fantasy face-to-face conversation, imagined by the reader, where the stranger fits into a specific role which the reader requires&lt;ref&gt;Suler, J. (2005). The online disinhibition effect. International Journal Of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, 2 (2), pp. 184--188.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Video based communications give you both voice and facial recognition aspects but they provide a different atmosphere than from when you are in the same room as another human being. For example, content and micro facial expressions can be lost through a drop in signal or a low quality webcam. Eye contact can provide a lot of information and be a strong non-verbal cue in a conversation, and it can never be achieved with the use of webcams.

===Locked In===
Locked in is the idea that some software and ideas are used so much that they become industry standard, and are accepted by most people to the extent that they are nearly impossible to change. Lanier often uses the example of MIDI, a system which was created in the early 1980's. This system concerns musical notes and it transfers them from electronic instruments to computers. Lanier argues that this system is not the best and has limitations; however, as many new and different programmes have been created and adapted to be able to use it, it means that MIDI is still currently used. Another example is the QWERTY keyboard. This layout of keyboard became popular and frequently used in type writers. As most people know how to type using this sort of keyboard and are familiar with this layout, using another one would most likely not be successful with people, meaning that the QWERTY keyboard remains used&lt;ref&gt;Fish, A. (2011). Book review: Jaron Lanier, You Are Not a Gadget: A Manifesto. New York: Alfred Knopf, 2010. New Media \&amp; Society, 13 (3), pp. 510--513&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Key Theorists==

[[File:Danah boyd, Web 2.0 Conference.jpg|thumbnail|left|danah boyd]]
===danah boyd===

: ''&quot;It's no longer about on or off really. It's about living in a world where being networked to people and information wherever and whenever you need it is just assumed. I may not be always-on the Internet as we think of it colloquially, but I am always connected to the network. And that's what it means to be always-on.&lt;ref&gt;boyd , danah (2012) ‘Participating in the Always - On Culture’ in Mandiberg (ed.) The Social Media Reader. p. 71-72. Retrieved 4/4/14 from https://archive.org/stream/TheSocialMediaReader/Mandiberg-theSocialMediaReader-cc-by-sa-nc_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;'' -danah boyd 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danah_boyd danah boyd] is an academic researcher, focusing primarily on social media and how society interacts with it. Her work in ''The Social Media Reader'' &lt;ref&gt; boyd, danah (2012) 'Participating in the Always-On Lifestyle' in The Social Media Reader, London: New York University Press. &lt;/ref&gt; highlights the problems that arise when defining the 'always-on' lifestyle, especially looking at when being online begins and ends. In this boyd argues that different social contexts create different relationships with being 'always-on', meaning that how society uses technology is not defined by space, but by the contexts we create. Continuing with this idea, boyd reasons that 'always-on-ers' are characterised by their values and lifestyle rather than generation. Therefore raising questions of who is involved in this 'always-on' lifestyle according to their professional life and social activities, widely varying the spectrum. Technological literacy is no longer limited to the younger generations as we see a rise in more and more user friendly technology that can be used by the majority. Furthermore, boyd supports the notion that technology provides a new area for understanding, curiosity, and interaction allowing users to gain knowledge about people and information, with 'always-on-ers' taking full advantage of the possibilities available.

boyd summarises the effects of the 'always-on' culture by using the example of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat Snapchat].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2014/03/21/snapchat-attention.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In this blog post she points out how technology users automatically scroll through information without taking the time to engage with it. A result of being 'always-on' is mindlessly accessing information without any need or desire to. However, Snapchat offers a solution to mindless media consumption by limiting the amount time the information is available for, portraying the message of &quot;You’ve got 7 seconds. PAY ATTENTION&quot;. This type of technology forces people to engage with media again rather than only being semi-consciously aware of their 'always-on' lifestyle.

'''The Blurring of Virtual and Reality'''

This is an idea that boyd argues is applying more and more to our everyday lives. This exist because technology is gradually replacing tasks that would otherwise be carried out manually. Examples of this lie in the writing of essays, communicating with others, applying for jobs, entertainment, and gaining knowledge. Due to this different spheres of life are infiltrating others, such as work and leisure, meaning that since users can be communicated at all times through technology. Therefore, new information related to work can be read at home, and the same for personal news can be found out whilst at work. It could be argued that this blurring of leisure and work is the consequential result of the blurring of virtual and reality. 

'''Ubiquity'''

One of boyd's main ideas is that technology and connectivity has become ubiquitous. This means that the technologies are being used as part of everyday life, and no longer thought of as simply technology. boyd refers to ubiquity in terms of how technology is becoming part of the social infrastructure, and supporting people in what they do. Furthermore, boyd is referring to the connectivity of technology and how it is a service for everyday people, not just technologists. This relates to 'always-on' culture because as technology becomes more ubiquitous it is being used for more reasons in everyday life, and thus is a key component in being 'always-on'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danah.org/papers/talks/Etech2007.html], boyd, d. (2007) Retrieved on 2nd April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The 'Network''''

Being surrounded by technology also links in with boyd's idea of what the 'network' truly means. boyd believes that the 'network' does not refer to the technology available, but rather to the idea that it offers a new platform to express pre-existing cultural ideas. Interaction and engagement are the driving forces behind information access and communication within the &quot;networked public&quot;. boyd argues that this formation of networks is primarily visible on social networking sites(SNSs) and media-sharing websites. The purposes of these networks, according to boyd, are socialisation, consumption, and civic engagement. This links to 'always-on' culture because socialising is being greatly influenced by technology and ease it offers in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danah.org/papers/essays/DigitalHandshakes.pdf], boyd, d. (2007) Retrieved on 2nd April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Addiction to Technology'''

According to boyd being always-on is like being a part of the online community where people are connected to each other through layers of information. She calls it an ‘ecosystem in which people can stay connected to one another through a variety of microdata’. That’s where she made interesting point about online addiction. Some people see being always-on as an obsession; a virtual sickness which destroys lives. Boyd argues that always-on has nothing to do with technological addiction but more to do with the passion that people have for information and the lives of others.&lt;ref&gt;boyd, d. (2012) 'Participating in an Always-on Lifestyle'. pp. 74 - 75&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Online and Offline Lives'''

Whilst boyd seems to make a relevant point that our online lives are as ‘real’ as our offline lives, more could be said about the significant difference between these two aspects of our lives, in particular how we behave online versus how we behave offline. Suler (2005) makes the point that when we communicate online, our input comes after some delay, perhaps minutes or hours or days, and this affects what we say, in text form, and how we say it. Importantly, he asserts that when we communicate face-to-face with others, “moment-by-moment responses between people powerfully shapes the ongoing flow of self-disclosure, usually in the direction of conforming to social norms” (p. 185). If this is the case, if an increasing amount of our time is spent online this could perhaps leave some people struggling with face-to-face social skills necessary to fit into a particular environment, such as that of an organisation with a clear expectations of cultural behaviour, or to succeed in particular roles where face-to-face interaction with people is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Suler (2005) p.185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sherry Turkle===

[[File:Sherry Turkle.jpg|thumbnail|Sherry Turkle]]

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherry_Turkle Sherry Turkle] is another key theorist associated with 'always-on' culture and, specifically related to 'the tethered self'. Sherry Turkle is an American professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the area of social studies.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian. (2013). Sherry Turkle: 'We're losing the raw, human part of being with each other. Retrieved 03/23, 2014, from http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/may/05/rational-heroes-sherry-turkle-mit&lt;/ref&gt; Turkle is a hugely influential theorist in this field and is incredibly important when talking in terms of Social Media and this 'always-on' culture.  She has contributed to many academic papers and research journals, with much of her work focusing on the psychology of human relationships and technology where she discusses and develops further this notion of the 'tethered self' stating that:

&quot;Networked, we are together, but so lessened are our expectations of each other that we can feel utterly alone. And there is the risk that we come to see others as objects to be accessed - and only for the parts we find useful, comforting or amusing.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Turkle, S. (2011). Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less From Each Other, New York: Basic Books &lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;We are tethered to our 'always-on/always-on-us' communications devices and the people and things we reach through them: people, Webpages, voice mail, games, artificial intelligences... they live for us through our tethering devices, always ready-to-mind and hand.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Turkle, S.(2008). Always-On/Always-On-You: The Tethered Self. from Katz, J E., Handbook of Mobile Communication Studies. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press &lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Tethered Self'''

The &quot;Tethered Self&quot; is a prominent part of her 'always-on' study.   This idea concerns the way in which people are connected and have access to it a communication device, such as a smart phone.  She often discusses how people can always be reached through mobiles or emails and if the person cannot contact the users, then machines often represent them, such as voicemail.  Also,  how a growing number of people are connected to some sort of network, such as Facebook, and rarely disconnect from it.  From interviews she has conducted, she concludes that people, especially teenagers, feel at a loss without their mobile and without being connected.  She argues that people have become more reliant on their technologies and this has led to users checking their networks more for any notifications. For example, users checking their smart phones for notifications.&lt;ref name='Turkle&gt;Turkle, S. (2013). Always-On/Always-On-You: The Tethered Self. Handbook of Mobile Communication Studies. (pp. 121). Massachusetts: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Life on The Screen'''

Another book published by Turkle in 1995 'Life on The Screen: Identity in The age of the Internet' which is part of her work based around computers and the effect they have on us. She developed ideas of 'cyberspace' - a place where we can, every day, go to interact and connect with people anywhere- and develop relationships with them online. In writing she said human beings were changing and adapting due being unable to distinguish between computers and real life. 

The concept of being able to go on at any time to speak to someone any where gives the idea of being 'always-on' and in this sense, with a computer. Always having access to these online worlds and being able to be reached from people even when we are not there, we are still 'always-on'. &lt;ref&gt; Turkle, S. (1997). Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet. Simon &amp; Schuster; 1st Touchstone Ed edition &lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Second Self'''

The “Second Self” is Sherry Turkle's second published book.  Throughout, she refers to ideas of computers being more than a device and how it is an important part of the user’s life, physiologically and socially.&lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. (2005) “The Second Self Twentieth Anniversary Edition.” Massachusetts: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; Her book is based upon opinions and attitudes of people who use computers and how that effects on their lives. &lt;ref&gt;NY Times. (1984) “The Second Self.” Retrieved 04/01, 2014, from http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/03/specials/turkle-second.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Written in 1984, before today's technology was invented and before most people owned a smart phone,  Turkle expresses ideas that could lead to today's 'always-on' culture such as the fear people initially had about becoming &quot;addicted&quot; to technology.&lt;ref name= ‘Turkle’&gt;Turkle, S. (2005) “The Second Self Twentieth Anniversary Edition.” Massachusetts: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Turkle also mentions ideas, similar to theorist Marshall McLuhan, of technology extending the self but she also adds how it extends the “external” world for the user.&lt;ref name= ‘NY Times’&gt;NY Times. (1984) “The Second Self.” Retrieved 04/01, 2014, from http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/03/specials/turkle-second.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
She states in the book, the idea that technology “changes not only in what we do but how we think” which is similar to her ideas in “Alone Together.”  This idea is emphasised in her later work as by then more technology had been developed and consumed. &lt;ref name= ‘Turkle’&gt;Turkle, S. (2004) “The Second Self Twentieth Anniversary Edition.” Massachusetts: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alone Together'''

Her book &quot;Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less From Each Other&quot; (2011) mentions the idea of 'always-on' culture and the relationship between people and technology and the consequences that can have.
This is where she drew on the main ideas of 'tethering' and the 'always-on' culture. She made points about how we are more connected now than what we have ever been before but with that we are still alone. We are replacing our social interactions- conversations and intimacy with texting and communicating through computer use. &lt;ref&gt; Turkle, S. (2011). Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less From Each Other, New York: Basic Books &lt;/ref&gt;

Turkle gave a talk through the website [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TED_(conference) TED] called &quot;Connected, but still alone?&quot; here she discussed some of the main points from the book. She talked about the ideas of communication and how it changed who we are and what we do and so we are developing social problems when it comes to being offline. We are now expecting less from each other and more from our technologies altering our relationships and friendships in the outside world and we are also losing valuable skills in conversation and social behaviour do to our new forms of connection and technology.&lt;ref name='Ted Talks'&gt;Ted Talks.

===Leslie Perlow=== 

'''About'''

[http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=24278 Leslie Perlow] is a professor of Leadership in the Organizational Behaviour area at Harvard Business School.  Most of her research focuses on being 'always-on' in the work place. In her latest publication, “Sleeping With Your Smartphone” she focuses on employees of businesses who feel the need to be always online and always be connected and she discusses how disconnecting can be the most powerful tool for them.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business School. (2014). Leslie A. Perlow. Retrieved 03/29, 2014, from http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=24278&amp;facInfo=fea&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Sleeping With Your Smartphone'''

In her latest publication, “Sleeping With your Smartphone,” she surveys thousands of different businesspeople in different professions over how much they work and their smartphone habits.  Some of her questions included how often they check their phone and how often they can disconnect from it. She argues that professionals feel pressure to be 'always-on' and they often feel that if they disconnect, others may still stay on and become more successful than them.&lt;ref&gt;Huffington Post. (2012). Turning Off Your Smartphone: More Stress or Less?. Retrieved 09/29, 2014, from http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leslie-perlow/work-stress_b_1429692.html&lt;/ref&gt;  
Due to different time zones and needing to be contactable for clients and fellow colleagues, Perlow has argued that it leads to employees to change their timetable and reschedule their time to make sure that they are always connected and remain to be perceived as a good employee as constantly being on is often expected from high pressure jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business Review. (2012). Are You Sleeping With Your Smartphone?. Retrieved 03/29, 2014, from http://blogs.hbr.org/2012/05/are-you-sleeping-with-your-sma/&lt;/ref&gt;    

'''Disconnecting'''

Perlow experimented with a company, Boston Consulting Company, to see if their employees would be able to disconnect and if that could be achieved.  At 6:00pm each night, a different employee would be able to disconnect from their work network and other employees were able to deal with clients if need be.  
Most employees felt many benefits such as finding their work more satisfying.  They also felt that they regained more control over their work life.  
Perlow argues that when this approach is applied correctly, not being 'always-on' can benefit not just the employee but the organisation as well.&lt;ref&gt;Big Think. (2012). Switching Off An &quot;Always on&quot; Culture.. Retrieved 03/29, 2014, from http://bigthink.com/videos/switching-off-an-always-on-culture-2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thriving in an Overconnected World'''
In 2013, Perlow gave a TEDTalk on what she perceived as a detrimental effect that the 'always-on' culture of smartphones was having on businesses and organizations, as well as family life and relationships. She asserted that because of 'always-on' culture existing, people are constantly checking their smartphones for updates on career-related issues, e-mails from colleagues, or for information about their current duties at work - all the while squandering the time they spend outside of work doing this. Perlow describes this as a common attitude - stating that it is easy for one to think it's the best thing to do for their career. She further asserts that these behaviors have lead to a significant deterioration in the relationships and skills people use to deal with situations and issues outside of the workplace. Perlow concludes by asserting that this &quot;overconnected world&quot; does not have to lead to negative effects - if proper changes are made to the workplace structure and certain criteria are established for what is and what is not good use of one's connected devices, work and life can be improved, avoiding the downfalls of an &quot;overconnected&quot; society. &lt;ref&gt;TED.com.

===Naomi Baron===

'''About'''

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Baron Naomi Baron] is a linguist and professor of linguistics at American University in Washington D.C. She researches topics such as language in social context, language acquisition and computer medicated-communication. Her book, Always On: Language in an Online and Mobile World, which was published in 2008, won the English-Speaking Union’s HRH The Duke of Edinburgh ESU English Language Book Award for 2008. 

'''Domestication of technology''' 

In her book, 'Always On: Language in an Online and Mobile World' she talks about the idea of domestication of technology, a theory with comes from Rodger Silverstone and Leslie Haddon. This is the idea that we use technology as an everyday essential without giving it a second thought. She explains that such communication technologies has gradually changed our social norms and an example of this is that it is so much easier for us to go online and find out what the weather is going to be rather than turn on our televisions, go to the weather channel and await our local report. As domestication of communication technologies spreads through the populace, people are increasingly “on” networks that extend beyond the landline. Her theory that the domestication of such technologies like email, IM, blogging and facebook can have some dangers. The first is that once you become “on” it is hard to come “off” and it is increasingly easy to being 'always-on'. Once you have got past the first fees of buying a computer or a phone it becomes less and less expensive to keep connected through them. Secondly is that anyone can be an author or a publisher and can surpass legal authorities. And the third one and probably the most dangerous is the compromising of our safety and privacy. This is potentially the worst but can be put simply from accidentally sending an email to the wrong person or before you are finished to some of our banking information being hacked or stolen.

==Effects of Being &quot;Always-On&quot;==

===Advantages===

'''Instant Information'''

A main advantage of being 'always-on' is being able to receive information and news as soon as it becomes available. Prior to the advancement we have seen in technology today, people would have to log on to a PC, buy a newspaper or wait for a letter to arrive at their door to receive information. Nowadays, however, they can receive these kind of communications instantly through their mobile device and, in some cases, be notified exactly when they become available. The time taken to communicate has been significantly shortened and made much more convenient for the user. As the world becomes more and more online everything we need becomes more readily available to us. We can get information in a matter of seconds and everything that we need to know we are able to find out. According to filmmaker [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Shlain Tiffany Shlain] director of 'Connected: An Autoblogography About Love, Death &amp; Technology', &quot;something happens in one place and we can see it, feel it, and do something about it which has such huge potential&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Shlain, T. (2011). Connected: An Autoblogography About Love, Death &amp; Technology. Video. Retrieved from http://www.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70166245&amp;trkid=13462100&amp;tctx=-99%2C-99%2Cd198df6c-98f6-426a-876d-d4ec4155f6b2-8256831 &lt;/ref&gt;.

Information is no longer something that takes an exertion to locate, we have it right at our finger tips. “Work will be dominated by fast-moving, geographically diverse, free-agent teams of workers connected via socially mediating technologies.” (Fred Stutzman, Carnegie Mellon) This theory explains the influence that being “always-on” has on us and the idea of what its effect on our society has been. It is thought that because the spread of information is so quick, diverse and free moving, that our society will become quick, diverse and free moving, and as a result of this, our culture will benefit greatly. All of these factors make for a much more efficient way of communicating and working. According to Royston Martin (2009) the notion of media being “everywhere and always on” does not have to be viewed negatively. “The spread of free, easily accessible instant information – be it on, for example, health care or democratic election processes – are small examples of the potential the digital media has to help raise living standards.”

'''Development of Different Skills'''

There are a lot of theories that say the 'always-on' culture is having a negative effect on children and teens with side effects as lower attention span and inability to work through problems. This may be true however there are a lot of other benefits that our weigh these. Studies show that 55 percent of those surveyed say that the brains of young people in 2020 will be wired differently from those of their parents. What’s more, they say, is the ability of always-connected young people to nimbly get information from an array of online sources and then share it seamlessly among a broad network of people is a positive trend. (Laura B. Weiss, 2012) It is shown that the younger generation may not be able to do the same things their parents can do however they will have skills that are above their parents head. With these on-going technological advances it may not be as necessary for the younger generation to have really long attention spans as information is so available however it may be more beneficial for them to have the skills to hunt down information and share it to a mass audience.  Young people born around the year 2000  “have grown up in a world that has come to offer them instant access to nearly the entirety of human knowledge, and incredible opportunities to connect, create, and collaborate,” says Janna Anderson (Laura B. Weiss, 2012) Therefore these are the way their brains have developed and grown to adapt to these circumstances therefore will be affluent in this particular set of skills unlike their parents who have had to adapt to their generational technologies and grew up with a set of skills that would help them in their world. 

'''Making Plans and Meeting Up'''

Now that the majority of Westernised society has a mobile phone, meeting up with individuals or groups has become much easier. Before the popularization of the mobile phone, people would have most likely contacted one another via land-line. A simple plan would be made to meet up, and the persons involved would not talk to one another again until they saw each other in person at the time and place agreed. Now, thanks to mobile technology, plans can be altered with ease, depending on the situation. For example, if a person on a train which is running late, they can contact their 'always-on' friend from their mobile to let them know what is going on and to rearrange plans.

'''Communication with Others and Synchronisation of Media'''

A major upside of 'always-on' culture is the ease of communication that it has brought to people - particularly technologically engaged youths. If one desires to communicate with another electronically, there are nearly infinite ways of accomplishing this - all depending on the type of communication desired. One can use microblogs (sites like Twitter), blogs (like Tumblr, Wordpress, or Blogspot), social media sites like Facebook, or they could even use various multimedia forms of communication like e-mail, text messaging, or Skype in order to communicate easily with other individuals. On top of the ease of communication that 'always-on' culture affords, it also supports a fantastic level of synchronisation for most forms of social media. For instance, one can easily link their Instagram account to their Facebook, Twitter, or Tumblr accounts (as well as many other social networking sites)&lt;ref&gt;http://help.instagram.com/169948159813228&lt;/ref&gt;, allowing posts on any or all of those sites to be visible across platforms, and also allowing the user to keep their communications and musings synchronised across multiple platforms of social media and keeping things orderly at the same time.

===Disadvantages===

'''&quot;Disconnectivity Anxiety&quot; (DA)'''

DA is, as defined by Dr. Jim Taylor, &quot;a persistent and unpleasant condition characterized by worry and unease caused by periods of technological disconnection from others&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Taylor, J. (2010). Disconnectivity Anxiety. Retrieved from http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-jim-taylor/disconnectivity-anxiety_b_647773.html &lt;/ref&gt;. This anxiety can come from anything, such as, not being able to connect to the Internet or someone not responding quickly enough to a message. From Taylor's perspective, the constant need to be connected is a problem in society and people should make an effort to detach themselves when the technology is not necessary.

'''“Continuous Partial Attention” (CPA)'''

CPA is: “to pay partial attention — CONTINUOUSLY” &lt;ref&gt; Stone, L. (2009). Continuous Partial Attention. Retrieved from: http://lindastone.net/qa/continuous-partial-attention/ &lt;/ref&gt;. The term was coined by writer Linda Stone in 1998. When we use our attention in this way, we are dividing it between multiple things but at a superficial level. CPA is motivated “by a desire to be a LIVE node on the network”. Continuous partial attention is different from multitasking, we multitask to be more efficient and we use CPA because we don’t want to miss anything. In large doses, it can play a part in creating a very stressful lifestyle through &quot;operating in crisis management mode&quot;.

'''Reduced Personal Privacy'''

It has been noted that always being connected can disrupt and interfere with an individual's privacy, as they simply cannot disconnect themselves. Jan van Dijk talks of, particularly in relation to the use of GPS technology in social media, an inability for an individual to detach themselves from their 'network' for personal reasons - simply because society as a whole now functions in an 'always-on' fashion&lt;ref&gt;van Dijk, J.(1999) 'The Network Society', London: SAGE Publications Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&quot;There is pressure in all communications technology to ''be within reach at any time and place'' [...] it causes the individual to be traceable to the deepest crevices of the social fabric and in all environments. Almost every place becomes a social place. And even if one tries and succeeds using blocking options, the chances of having to justify oneself are increasing&quot;&lt;ref&gt;van Dijk, J.(1999) 'The Network Society', London: SAGE Publications Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;.

It is argued that being 'always-on' is an increasing danger to personal autonomy, as our &quot;natural space to withdraw&quot;&lt;ref&gt;van Dijk, J.(1999) 'The Network Society', London: SAGE Publications Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; is shrinking as a direct result&lt;ref&gt;van Dijk, J.(1999) 'The Network Society', London: SAGE Publications Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;. Being 'always-on' and open to so many social outlets takes away an individual's personal time, whilst reducing their ability to switch off, which would eventually result in an overload of data to process; as no individual has the capacity to take in all that the internet has to offer&lt;ref&gt;boyd, d (2012) 'Participating in the Always-On Culture' in The Social Media Reader&lt;/ref&gt;.   
  
'''Inability to Focus'''

As discussed in Nicholas Carr's book 'The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains',' always being connected to the Internet or mobile network can create difficulty to focus on any single thing for more than a few minutes  &lt;ref&gt; Carr, N. (2012) &quot;Nicholas Carr - The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains,&quot; video. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt_NwowMTcg &lt;/ref&gt;. The Internet gives you short bursts of information and then leads you to something else not giving a lot of time to focus on one thing. 

'''Changing Attitudes'''

Turkle expresses how she feels that attitudes of users of the technology is changing.  She often mentions how communication is breaking down due to the increasing use of technology to communicate. Turkle also argues that the way technology is now being used is not just changing the way the users communicate with each other, but it is also changing the user as a person.  The need for attention is able to fulfilled by social media and the ability to message people from a device but this can also lead to users feeling more bored or alone in real life situations.  In a 2012 Ted Talk, she expresses how face-to-face communication is suffering due to the rise of online conversation and how even when people are in them presence of others they often want to be somewhere else, so they communicate online while in the company of others.  She gives the example of people texting and emailing from boardrooms and during meetings.  Overall, she expresses that the popularity of communicating online and the the decline of communicating in person hence creating a feeling of isolation for the user.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Talks.

'''Psychological Damage by Being 'Always-On'

There are some psychological issues related to being ‘always-on'. 'Being drop into a mode of permanent online activity’ can create lots of stress and anxiety. Constantly checking messages on the smartphones can lead to the point that there is no break whatsoever. This situation can create a feeling of being overwhelmed, depressed and in some cases makes people even to commit suicide.The pressure of being ‘always-on’ is huge, especially in the work place. There is confusion where the media demands stop and where the life starts. &quot;Work and life are blended into a stressful soup of endless demands. In many workplaces, switching off is seen as uncommitted, even unprofessional&quot;. Many people are place in the situation that the demands from the work place take over their personal life.&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph (2014) The 'always -on' culture: smartphones, stress and suicide. Retrieved from http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/micwright/100009425/the-always-on-culture-smartphones-stress-and-suicide/  &lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing Media Industries and Convergence===

===== Newspapers =====

Newspapers fall under the heading of “old media” whilst the Internet is considered “new media”. It could be argued that newspapers are becoming a thing of the past. They were once the only means for people to be informed of current events around the globe and could typically be found in every household. However, now the need to buy a newspaper is waning due to free websites providing up-to-date information, sharing news the instant it occurs. In the age of Twitter and trending topics, there is far less need to track down newsworthy events when they will come to you whether you seek them or not. Many online news providers let users customize their news feed so only topics their interested come to them, such as RSS Feeds.&lt;ref&gt;Using Google News RSS Feeds - News Help. (2014). Retrieved from https://support.google.com/news/answer/59255?hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; Older generations might still purchase newspapers; however, newspaper readership in the younger generations is declining as they have all the information they could need at their fingertips. 

Many traditional print newspapers are putting more money and resources into the digital side of news. “At present, the major British newspapers are edging sideways towards the digital tipping point. Print staffs and print supplements and people and resources shifted into digital.” &lt;ref&gt; Brock, G. (2013). Out of print. &lt;/ref&gt; As well as regularly updated websites, many newspapers have launched smartphone apps allowing people to access news on the move and provide notifications for breaking news. Some newspapers have made the complete digital transition as physical readership couldn't maintain profit; instead, newspapers find it more cost beneficial to &quot;print&quot; online, thereby reaching more users and cutting costs.

=====Television=====
As Marshall McLuhan said: ''&quot;There is a basic principle that distinguishes a hot medium like radio from a cool one like the telephone, or a hot medium like the movie from a cool one like TV... A hot medium is one that extends one single sense in &quot;high definition&quot;.''  &lt;ref&gt; McLuhan, M. (1964). Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man. New York: McGraw-Hill &lt;/ref&gt;

Television was once a cool medium - meaning something that could be consumed passively, unlike a movie at the cinema or a lecture for example. However, the more we use social media and the internet, the more interactive television is becoming.  &lt;ref&gt; Koten, Hamid van. (2006) &quot;The Digital Image and the Pleasure Principle: The Consumption of Realism in the Age of Simulation&quot;. In Digital Visual Culture ed. Anna Bentkowska-Kafel, Trish Cashen and Hazel Gardiner. Intellect Books: Bristol &lt;/ref&gt;

Although TV had become interactive before smartphone technology, with the popularisation of voting reality shows like Big Brother (Channel 4/Five) to magazine programmes with debating segments such as This Morning (ITV), the boom in social media and 'always-on' culture has meant that audiences now expect TV shows to have a presence online and want to have their say more than ever. &lt;ref&gt; BBC Academy (2013). Online and social media in TV. Retrieved from http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/production/article/art20130823083150575 &lt;/ref&gt;

For example, it is now possible to download apps for specific TV shows to a smartphone which allow the user to interact with the shows producers and with other viewers. This year, the BBC launched an app for their talent show The Voice which allows users to play along with the blind audition element of the show and voice their opinion, as well as vote in the later stages of the programme. &lt;ref&gt; Digital Spy. (2014) The Voice UK launches new iOS, Android app for series 3 Retrieved from http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s154/the-voice-uk/news/a541355/the-voice-uk-launches-new-ios-android-app-for-series-3.html#~oAiFgbk054sHOs &lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of this is the frequent reminders during a television show to &quot;Like&quot; Facebook pages and to &quot;Tweet&quot; using certain hashtags which essentially encourage the viewer to join in discussions about the programme and receive the latest news on it. This both helps the shows producers understand the audience they have and make sure that they draw in as big an audience as possible as reminders can be sent out.

====Video Games====
Many popular video games have recently begun to utilise social media as a way to report the player's progress through the game as they play it. For instance, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_2:_Among_Thieves Uncharted 2: Among Thieves] features an option for players to link their Twitter account to the game, and as they play the game, whenever they reach a milestone of progression across the game's many chapters, Twitter will post snapshots or small updates of the player's progress&lt;ref&gt;Flip the Media. (2009).  Social Networks and Video Games. Retrieved 4/4/14 from http://flipthemedia.com/2009/11/social-networks-and-video-games/&lt;/ref&gt;. Another notable example of this is with the recent title [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V Grand Theft Auto V]. In Grand Theft Auto V, the player is presented with the option to link their game account to their Facebook account, allowing the game to post status updates and small bits of information about the player's behavior in the game (such as number of in-game kills, recently completed missions, or recently-won multiplayer games). As well as this Rockstar games has also created an online game profile category which enables players from all over the world to link together and share player profiles of your in game progress, evidently video game producers are admirably trying to converge and synergies social media and online gaming as much as possible to keep an Always-On culture active to keep the success and 'Buzz' surrounding the game. 

Additionally, in a more aggregate sense, there is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achievement_%28video_gaming%29 popular system of measuring progress] on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox Xbox] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation Playstation] consoles (referred to as Achievements and Trophies, respectively). These systems of measurement track a player's progress as they complete goals set by the game's designers. Many third-party websites allow players of games on these consoles to automatically update their social networks (such as Twitter or Facebook) with notifications of their progress. Additionally, the Playstation supports native Twitter integration support for players to cross-post their Trophies to their feeds.

With the introduction of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_%28eighth_generation%29 current generation of gaming consoles], the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ps4 Playstation 4] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One Xbox One] both feature the capacity to share video feeds of any one player's gameplay in real-time via popular video game streaming site [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch.tv Twitch.tv]&lt;ref&gt;The Verge. (2013). Xbox at E3 2013: everything you need to know.

====Fashion Industry====
Similarly, the concept of constant technology has further branched out into other major industries across the world influencing fashion as well as culture and social aspects of everyday living. Zeki (2014) describes - in an interview with designer Tuba Ergin - how the fashion world and technological world are becoming forever more 'harmonised' with each other, as well as how each compliment one another. Designer Ergin, showcased his designs at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Istanbul in 2012, which included the new addition of circuit cards into each of his fashion garments including dresses and tops, and furthermore onto shoes and bags. Ergin (2014) mentions how each and every one of us now as members of society are now fully under the influence of the sheer absorption of technology. He evens goes as far to state that &quot;I believe there is almost no difference between drug abuse and technology addiction&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Ergin, T. (2014) &lt;/ref&gt; Such a statement allows us to see how we are now fully 'Always On' with our devices and the extent to which can be compared to such a heavily addictive substance such as drugs. In his interview, Ergin then goes on to discuss the developments of our devices that we are forever always using in our everyday lives such as technological glasses as well as watches. However, he then states that technology in the future will lead into clothes that can react to body temperature and the human pulse, such advancements will allow fitness merchandise to rocket, presumably.

====Marketing Industry====
Technology addiction has had a massive influence over the business-orientated world. With people constantly being visible and incorporated in their online world allows large businesses to make thousands of pounds from these users. The more people are on their phones and technology devices, the more money companies make. Such large organisations such as Facebook allow their adverts to become more expensive and make great amounts of money on their customers simply through their use online being forever constant. Cookies and other internet bugs allow marketers to track every move we make online and more importantly, how long we are on a certain webpage for and where our mouse is hovering. Such details allow them to store great information on the everyday user and can show the great extent to how intense the everyday person is 'always on' on their devices. Therefore, it is clear that marketers are cashing in on us ourselves being constantly addicted to our devices.

====Social Media, Celebrity and Fan Culture====

Social media - in particular, Twitter - now allows us to keep up to date with what is going on in the lives of people we admire and the fan communities surrounding them. It is now very rare to find a significant individual in the public eye who does not own a Twitter account as developing an online presence within this 'always-on' culture helps to create and keep up interest in what you are promoting - even if what you are promoting is simply yourself as an online personality. 

There is a law of attraction which states that people develop a greater preference for something that they are exposed to often &lt;ref&gt; Psych Central. (2009) Mere Exposure Effect. Retrieved from http://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/2009/mere-exposure-effect/ &lt;/ref&gt; which, when applied to social media, may help us to understand how online fan communities work. The greater the presence that the social media user has online - particularly if they are already famous offline - will help create fans or increase interest among casual fans. Once we are enticed by a user through their social media account, it can become very addictive and very often people will feel that they need to know what is happening in that persons life - no matter how trivial. Fan communities and sites can also help to increase interest in a subject. Therefore, as they are 'always-on&quot;, we are 'always-on'.

====Always-On and the Growing Effect on Society====


The rise of the 'always-on' culture is having drastic effects on society as we know it today, the rise in technology is allowing everyone worldwide to be able to connect to the internet using personal devices such as smartphones and laptops 24/7 365 days a year. Studies into the effects of always being online are starting to develop more and more stories day by day, for example the effects of the 'always-on' culture in the workplace; Carsten Schloter, the 49-year-old chief executive of the Swiss telecoms group, Swisscom, was found dead at his home in July 2013, according to the Telegraph “The always-on culture: smartphones, stress and suicide” were main links to his death. Such links are tied in with the norms and traditions of working in an environment in the 21st century, one always has to be ‘always-on’ to read those important emails. “Though the culture of being instantly available for emails and calls is often a product of unspoken pressure, sometimes it’s official policy.” &lt;ref&gt; http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/micwright/100009425/the-always-on-culture-smartphones-stress-and-suicide/ &lt;/ref&gt;

The 'always-on' culture in education, is this culture changing education, how we learn and how our brains behave? Being always on can have it’s advantages and disadvantages, people who disconnect often get withdrawal feelings, ostracism and difficulty connecting, many professionals compare the withdrawal symptoms of disconnecting to that of drugs. Ignoring or creating a negative perception of technology in education that students willingly and actively use in every other aspect of their lives is not a winning educational strategy, research by Brian Chen  &lt;ref&gt; http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yq9cAPVjOusC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=always+on+culture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=br8-U83oG4ithQeWlIHYAQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=always%20on%20culture&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated how top performers in school and in further education were more likely to be those best at distinguishing high quality data. Whether technological devices make students smarter is neither here nor there, technology is only getting more advanced and therefor the always on culture in education is likely to grow more and more.

==Relating Always-On to Other Digital Media and Culture Topics==

===Cognitive Surplus===
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_surplus See also: Cognitive Surplus]

Technology has developed to allow the user to create and share their thoughts and ideas. 'Always-on' culture means individuals can partake in cognitive surplus when they so wish. 'Always-on' culture also allows the user to view collective work online at the touch of a button. For example, Wikipedia is free of data charges in Middle-East and Africa: http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Zero

Thus, the development of an always-on society has created a new means of collaboration and communication. An example of this can be seen in Peter Chroust's research on far-right political movements' use of the internet, in relation to the concept of 'smart mobs'. Chroust uses the example of the Taliban, although it is debatable whether this organisation can be referred to as a 'smart mob', the organisation must remain 'always-on' in order to act out and respond efficiently to 'spontaneous' action - and gather more support&lt;ref&gt;Chroust, P. 'Neo-Nazis and Taliban Online: Anti-Modern Political Movements and Modern Media'. In. Ferdinand, P (2000). ed. 'The Internet, Democracy and Democratization' &lt;/ref&gt;:

:&quot;To right-wing groups the internet not only serves as an electronic mail-box. It also enables the distribution of ideologies for political training of the cadres - and for reaching interested people outside the real network&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chroust, P. 'Neo-Nazis and Taliban Online: Anti-Modern Political Movements and Modern Media'. In. Ferdinand, P (2000). ed. 'The Internet, Democracy and Democratization' &lt;/ref&gt;.

Chroust does however note that the internet, alongside the act of being 'always-on', is most likely seldom utilized aside from through internal communication within the Taliban&lt;ref&gt;Chroust, P. 'Neo-Nazis and Taliban Online: Anti-Modern Political Movements and Modern Media'. In. Ferdinand, P (2000). ed. 'The Internet, Democracy and Democratization' &lt;/ref&gt;. Despite this, &quot;opponents of modernisation and globalisation&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chroust, P. 'Neo-Nazis and Taliban Online: Anti-Modern Political Movements and Modern Media'. In. Ferdinand, P (2000). ed. 'The Internet, Democracy and Democratization' &lt;/ref&gt; are present throughout the world, with organisations such as Al Qaeda operating in numerous countries across different time zones. It is with this in mind that being 'always-on' is an essential component of a 'smart mob' working quickly, efficiently and spontaneously&lt;ref&gt;Chroust, P. 'Neo-Nazis and Taliban Online: Anti-Modern Political Movements and Modern Media'. In. Ferdinand, P (2000). ed. 'The Internet, Democracy and Democratization' &lt;/ref&gt;:

:&quot;That explains why the Taliban invest financial resources and manpower in their presence on the internet. That most of the Afghan population have no electric light and even are illiterate, let alone have access to the world wide web, is not such a paradox as it first seems&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chroust, P. 'Neo-Nazis and Taliban Online: Anti-Modern Political Movements and Modern Media'. In. Ferdinand, P (2000). ed. 'The Internet, Democracy and Democratization' &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Technological Determinism===
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_determinism See also: Technological Determinism]

'Always-on' culture may bring about a big cultural shift relating to communication which has been determined by innovations in media technology where the user has the ability to be connected to the internet at all times. Technology has the power to transform culture, society and way people look at the world. Due to the advance in technology, people have developed a greater need to be connected to other people via mobiles/computers/tablets and are more likely to share experiences through these forms of communication than face-to-face.

===Online Identity===
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_identity See also: Online Identity]

Being 'always-on' leads to the constant overlapping of the user's real life identity and online one. It could be argued that the user's online identity is just as 'real' as their 'real life' identity - that an online identity is carefully thought out regarding what the user displays about themselves, but in face-to-face encounters it is much more 'real time' and people are perhaps a bit more vulnerable to show themselves in a less-than-ideal way - albeit showing a more 'natural' self. Online identity is about portraying of self as a living-out of states of being, becoming, belonging and behaving through the range of everyday social and discursive practices that are connected with the body. Yet it is also a close editing of self: ‘it’s me, but minus the things I don’t like about me’ – those aspects of self chosen to be shared with the public &lt;ref&gt; Thomson, A. (2007). Youth Online: Identity and Literacy in the Digital Age. Peter Lang Publishing: New York &lt;/ref&gt;. 

'Always-on' may mean that some users of technology feel the need to “check-in”, update their internet status or upload pictures from their real life to portray a specific online identity &lt;ref&gt; Mendelson, A.L &amp; Papacharissi, Z. (2010). Look at Us: Collective Narcissism in College Student Facebook Galleries from A Networked Self. Routledge: London &lt;/ref&gt;. These activities may take up a lot of time and be of great importance to individuals in order to determine an online identity which is always-on and available to access (i.e. Impression Management). Always-on with regard to texting, Facebook, email etc. will all contribute to your online identity as they are managed by you and reflect you as a person whether it is informally with friends (text, Facebook) or for a more professional purpose (email, LinkedIn). José van Dijck  &lt;ref&gt; Van Dijk, J. (2013). The Culture of Connectivity: A Critical History of Social Media. Oxford University Press: Oxford &lt;/ref&gt; differentiates between Facebook and LinkedIn, the former existing for users’ personal presentation of online identity and the latter for promotion of their professional identity with both organisations using similar means of connectivity. However, he also asserts that both platforms have a “vested interest in pushing the need for a uniform online identity” ''(p. 200)'' which may not be in the best interests of users who may want, for example, one identity for friends and another for employers.

McLuhan's view that the &quot;medium is the message” links to your 'always-on' identity: The medium in which you use to communicate affects the message originally intended. For example, text speak is informal, thus leading to a cultural change where acronyms, such as “LOL” (laugh out loud) are used in real conversation and bad punctuation is more frequent.

====&lt;u&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan Marshall McLuhan]&lt;/u&gt;====


McLuhan’s assertion that the 'medium is the message' seems to be becoming more evident as the technology we use is tied in with our identity and what it says about us. Three of the world’s largest technology companies, Google, Intel, and Facebook all announced, almost on the same day, that they were investing heavily in wearable technology. Google announced that it was partnering with Italy's Luxottica, the makers of Ray-Ban sunglasses and Oakley sports glasses to ensure their new smart glasses, Google Glass, were at the cutting edge of fashion &lt;ref&gt; The Guardian. (2014). Ray-Ban maker Luxottica to work with Google on Google Glass eyewear Retrieved 25/03 2014 from,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/25/ray-ban-maker-to-work-with-google-on-google-glass-eyewear &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; BBC. (2014). Facebook buys virtual reality headset start-up for $2bn. Retrieved 03/26 2014, from http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26742625 &lt;/ref&gt;. Google Glass is a small screen attached to a pair of glasses which can record video, access email, and retrieve information from the web by connecting wirelessly to a user's mobile phone. Intel, the world’s largest computer chip maker, increased its investment in wearable technology by buying Basis Science, a company that has devices and services for tracking a person’s health, and wanted to accelerate its position in wearable technology  &lt;ref&gt; BBC. (2014). Intel buys wearable technology firm Basis Science. Retrieved 03/26 2014, from http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26743537 &lt;/ref&gt;. Facebook also made a big investment in wearable technology by buying the virtual reality technology firm Oculus VR for £1.2bn and Mark Zuckerberg going as far as saying that “virtual reality will be the next social communications platform” &lt;ref&gt; The Guardian. (2014). Oculus: Facebook buys virtual reality gaming firm for $2bn Retrieved 25/03 2014 from, http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/25/facebook-buys-virtual-reality-gaming-firm-oculus &lt;/ref&gt; and will “change the way we work, play and communicate”  &lt;ref&gt; BBC. (2014). Intel buys wearable technology firm Basis Science. Retrieved 03/26 2014, from http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26743537 &lt;/ref&gt;.
If these investments by the world’s largest technology companies produce a proliferation of new, fashionable, technology, the reliance on wireless technology and greater bandwidth within that technology, will undoubtedly increase.

Van Koten’s work is of significant relevance to this development in wearable technology, particularly Facebook’s recent acquisition of Oculus VR. In the context of technology providing an extension of our social networks, Van Koten wants to uncover the ''“shift from the real to the imaginary as the dominant drive towards the consumption of these representations” &lt;ref&gt; Van Koten, H. (2009). The digital image and the pleasure principle: the consumption of realism in the age of simulation from Bentkowska-Kafel, A., Cashen, T. and Gardiner, H. (ed) Digital Visual Culture: Theory and Practice. Intellect: Bristol &lt;/ref&gt;''.
He says from a Jungian perspective, ''”games provide an outlet for the archetypal forces within the collective unconscious. Onscreen we can safely place ourselves in the role of the Hero […] alternatively, in a Freudian sense, games are a means of enacting the Oedipus complex” &lt;ref&gt; Van Koten, H. (2009). The digital image and the pleasure principle: the consumption of realism in the age of simulation from Bentkowska-Kafel, A., Cashen, T. and Gardiner, H. (ed) Digital Visual Culture: Theory and Practice. Intellect: Bristol &lt;/ref&gt; ''. Van Koten’s work build’s on that of McLuhan and it would seem with the three investments made by Google, Intel, and Facebook, the merging of games technology, which allows us to act in an imaginary world in much the same way as described in the disinhibition argument, with social media, his observation of the shift from the real to the imaginary will increase significantly.

==Introduction==

Cognitive Surplus, a term coined by Clay Shirky, is the concept of people using their mindpower to create and share content through various media platforms, particularly the internet and mobile phones, as opposed to merely being consumers of media. For example, watching television has now become so much part of our 21st century culture that over one trillion hours of free time a year is devoted to this act. However, with the presence of Web 2.0 and the increasing accessibility to and range of digital media platforms, in increasing number of people are spending this time creating and sharing content. We are motivated to do this in two different ways - intrinsically and extrinsically -and each contribution we make has a different value: personal, communal, civic or public.

==Main Concepts==

===Value===
Shirky discusses that all forms of creative acts have value, regardless of how mediocre they appear.  He claims that there is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work, and claims that even mediocre creations have value because they have at least bridged the gap between “doing anything and doing nothing” &lt;ref&gt; Shirky, C. (2010). ''How Cognitive Surplus Will Change The World''. Ted Talks. Retrieved from: http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cognitive_surplus_will_change_the_world &lt;/ref&gt; Shirky splits this value into four groups; Personal, communal, public and civic. &lt;ref&gt; Shirky, C. (2011). ''Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age''. London: Penguin Books, pp.173-5 &lt;/ref&gt;

*Personal - this is the basic kind of satisfaction we get from being active rather than passive. In personal value, both the participants and beneficiaries act individually, but get some kind of value our of one another’s presence. Shirky gives the example of 'lolcats' being a creative act with personal value - it has no other purpose or value other than for personal enjoyment and amusement. &lt;ref&gt; Shirky, C. (2011). ''Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age''. London: Penguin Books, pp. 173-4 &lt;/ref&gt;
*Communal - this is something which benefits a small community of people. Shirky uses Meetup.com as an example. This is a website in which like-minded individuals can arrange a “meetup” – anything from groups of hillwakers, to book enthusiasts, to coffee drinkers. Obviously this only benefits those who are members of the site, giving it communal value. &lt;ref&gt; Shirky, C. (2011). ''Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age''. London: Penguin Books, p. 174 &lt;/ref&gt;
*Public - Public value benefits any member of the public. It is fully interactive and is open to anyone, regardless of whether they are participants or not. &lt;ref&gt; Shirky, C. (2011). ''Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age''. London: Penguin Books, pp. 174 &lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include blogs or news websites such as Buzzfeed, the Huffington Post and the BBC News. 
*Civic - this could be seen as a cross between public value and communal value, as it is available to anyone, but is has more of an agenda – typically improving society in some way. &lt;ref&gt; Shirky, C. (2011). ''Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age''. London: Penguin Books, pp. 175 &lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include charities or awareness websites, such as womenkind.org which aims to improve the lives of women across the globe.

Shirky points out that although creative acts all have some kind of value, we should be more interested in those which have public and civic value because they benefit society, and are also harder to create. He points out that things with personal or communal value, such as lolcats, are never likely to go away or be under-provisioned. &lt;ref&gt; Shirky, C. (2011). ''Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age''. London: Penguin Books, pp. 175 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Motives - Intrinsic &amp; Extrinsic===
There are two types of motivation in terms of cognitive surplus. 
Intrinsic motivation is when the satisfaction of doing an activity is reward enough for a person. 
Extrinsic motivation is when there is an external reward for an activity, such as money.&lt;ref&gt;Shirky, C. (2011). Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age . London: Penguin Books. p.83.&lt;/ref&gt; 
This concept is linked to value, because acts with personal value can be seen to be generated by intrinsic  motivation, whereas acts with public or civic value can be seen to have been generated through extrinsic motivation, since the creator can gain a number of things through this - improved society, fame, or in some cases, money.

In 1970 psychologist, Edward Deci ran an experiment testing the motivations for why people do certain things. The experiment was on students who were asked to build shapes with seven uniquely shaped blocks. After the test Deci would leave the room for eight minutes and observe the subjects through a one way mirror. In the first instance Deci saw that the students would on average continue playing with the blocks for four minutes into the break, this will have been to satisfy their own needs to fulfil a task or because they enjoyed doing it. Deci then ran the same experiment, only this time half of the students were being paid one dollar for every complete shape that they built using the blocks. While on the break the students continued to play with the blocks for a minute more than the original test. The test was run for a third time with no reward being offered and the students on this occasion played with the block for just three minutes, so less than the original time and less than when there was money involved. This showed Deci that being offered a reward for something depressed the free choice factor of an activity and therefore showing extrinsic motivation can directly affect a person’s enjoyment of an activity. &lt;ref&gt;Shirky, C. (2011). Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age . London: Penguin Books. p.70-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second experiment was run by Deci to test these findings, and was again done using students. Four journalism students were the subjects and were not aware that they were being observed. They were told that for every headline they wrote for the bi-weekly student newspaper, they would receive 50cents. Another four journalism students who worked on a different day and also unaware they were being tested were offered no money for their headlines, they were the control group. The group that were being paid per headline were told after four weeks that the newspaper could no longer afford to pay them, and after this the speed of their writing was used an indicator for motivation. The final results showed that a monetary reward decreased a person’s intrinsic motivation, as the headline writing speed decreased when the extrinsic motivation was taken away from the subjects. This backed up Deci’s initial findings from the previous example that one’s enjoyment can be affected by an extrinsic motivation.&lt;ref&gt;Shirky, C. (2011). Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age . London: Penguin Books. p.70-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generosity===

Shirky believes that acting in a generous manner is the basis of allowing us and encouraging others to be innovators in creating valued content.  In the past, limited opportunities in the world dictated human’s role as media consumers or ‘couch potatoes.’  With opportunities remaining few, human behaviour changed little, and as a result the status of the population as couch potatoes remained.&lt;ref&gt;Shirky, C. (2011). Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age. London: Penguin Books, pp.63&lt;/ref&gt;

New media brought about a change in this behaviour however.  The introduction of new technology such as the internet, mobile phones and laptops allowed humans the opportunity to harness their cognitive surplus. They could utilise their generosity by making content, particularly online, which would stand to help or influence others in the online spectrum or otherwise.  In the past, many believed behaviour to be a stable category – one that changed very little over time.  However, with new media bringing a drastic change of behaviour this theory has been proved wrong.  Shirky summed up this new found realisation:  “In a world where opportunity changes little, behaviour will change little, but when opportunity changes a lot, behaviour will as well, so long as the opportunities appeal to real human motivations.”  

Despite this change in behaviour, Shirky believes that these new tools haven’t caused this generous behaviour, but instead given humans a platform in which to express their generosity.  Yochai Benkler, a legal scholar at Harvard, backs up this theory.  He, along with Helen Nissenbaum - a philosopher at NYU - wrote a paper in 2006 called “commons-Based Peer Production and Virtue.”  The title is Benkler’s term for systems that rely on voluntary contributors to operate.  They conducted a study into group participation, participation which takes place in order to make these contributions, largely voluntarily, to different outlets such as Slashdot or Kuro5hin.  They explored what the social motivations were for people who voluntarily worked as part of a group on different types of tasks.  They concluded that our new communications networks encourage membership and sharing and they also provide support for autonomy and competence.&lt;ref&gt;Shirky, C. (2011). Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age. London: Penguin Books, pp.78&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of being actively part of something propels us to contribute with the tasks that needs to be achieved.  This basic human emotion existed long before the introduction of new technology.  

With this new media providing a platform for people to express their generosity, there was a rapid surge in people using their generosity in order to help others and achieve their own motivations.  One example of this is the work done by fans of singer Josh Groban, or ‘Grobanites’ as they are referred as.  The story began when a group of hard-core fans gathered together to discuss what to get Groban for his twenty-first birthday.  After rejecting several ideas they decided to make a charitable donation in his name.  They raised over $1,000 dollars at a fundraiser and donated it to the David Foster Foundation.  After seeing the success of their first fundraiser, they decided to continue their work.  They decided to aim bigger, and attempted to attract other Grobanites to meet and donate through Josh Groban’s website JoshGroban.com.  The plan worked, and from his next birthday and over the course of the year raised over $100,000.  The success of the fundraising led to the founders creating their own non-profit organisation, Grobanites for Charity.  This organisations has spanned sister organisations such as Grobanites for Charity and Grobanites for Africa.  To date, Grobanites for Africa has generated over $150,000 to help fight poverty and the effects of HIV/AIDS, with 100% of the funds raised spent to help these causes.&lt;ref&gt;Shirky, C. (2011). Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age. London: Penguin Books, pp.66-69&lt;/ref&gt;  Through this example, Shirky demonstrates how generosity is key to creating something which others will see the benefits of.  Without this generosity, we would notice a steady decline in civic content and other factors would dominate people’s motivations for making content such as economical.

===Collective intelligence===

Collective intelligence is a term coined by French social theorist Pierre Lévy in his book “Collective Intelligence: mankind’s emerging world in cyberspace” (1999). Collective intelligence is defined by Lévy as a “form of universally distributed intelligence”. Simply put, collective intelligence is based on the fact that not one person knows everything. As a group (or collective) humans must use their individual knowledge to enhance and mobilise the skills and intelligence of both themselves and others. We do this through creating systems of networked intelligence, which is made possible through computers. Through the advance of technology in society, Lévy believes that the internet and the world wide web “will serve to filter and help us navigate knowledge and enable us to think collectively rather than simply haul masses of information around with us” &lt;ref&gt;Lévy, P. (1999). ''Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace''. Cambridge: Perseus Books&lt;/ref&gt;.
Our understanding of collective intelligence is core to the concept of cognitive surplus.
 
===Copyright===
A fundamental aspect of modern democracies is the recognition that products are created through creative labour, such as ideas and concepts. Therefore the copyright law came into existence in the UK in 1710 to:
*Protect the interests of authors and creators
*Ensure creators are credited for their work
*Regulate adaption, copy and fair use
*Regulate financial benefit
Copyright is a particular issue for cognitive surplus, because with so much original content being created and shared freely through digital media, problems can arise over who owns that material and who has a right to use it and distribute it, and how they are allowed to use it.

==Main Theorists==
===Clay Shirky===
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Shirky Clay Shirky] is a social theorist who studies the effect of the internet on society &lt;ref&gt;http://www.shirky.com/&lt;/ref&gt;. He popularised the concept of Cognitive Surplus through the publication of his book, &quot;Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age&quot;. In this book he argues that humans use their free time constructively to create value. He has written, talked about and studied Cognitive Surplus and has presented these ideas in different formats. 

====''Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age'' (2010)====
In ''Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age'', Shirky presents the concept of Cognitive Surplus, mostly through the use of case studies. He writes about the Cognitive Surplus created by the rise of television and how the internet has influenced this.


====TED Talk: Clay Shirky: How cognitive surplus will change the world====

In June of 2010, Clay Shirky presented a TED Talk on Cognitive Surplus entitled ‘How Cognitive Surplus Will Change the World’. &lt;ref&gt;Shirky, C. (2010). How Cognitive Surplus Will Change The World. Ted Talks. Retrieved 2nd April 2014 from: http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cognitive_surplus_will_change_the_world &lt;/ref&gt;

Shirky divides his notion of Cognitive Surplus in to two halves; the first half regards the abundance of free time that we have in the twenty-first century as consumers of media and how we may appropriate our individual talents for the purpose of production and sharing, and the second half being the media landscape as it stands today with modern technology such as mobile phones and computers which allow us to create and share that which we create.

Once Shirky explains how we can embrace our cognitive surplus, he goes on to note the two distinct values of that which is created. He terms these as that which has ‘communal’ value and that which has ‘civic’ value. Media with communal value is that which is created to entertain and encourage discourse within a community of media consumers and contributors. Examples of media produced with 'communal' value includes ‘LOLcats’, memes and music, video, picture and text content uploaded to sites such as Soundcloud, Youtube, Flickr and WordPress. Media with 'civic' value is that which is created as an outlet for information and data sharing. Shirky gives the example of Ushahidi, a website set up by two programmers who had read the blog of Ori Okolloh, a lawyer from Nairobi, who collated information regarding the 2007 election in Kenya and the consequent outbreak of violence caused by said election. Ushahidi was used as a service which collates reports from the field, such as those posted online or shared via mobile phones and similar devices, and displays useful information on a map. The purpose of this was to collate the necessary information and display what is happening and where it is happening live.  

Shirky believes that we are entering an &quot;age of generosity&quot; as both &quot;civic&quot; and &quot;communal&quot; values are both intrinsically good and not motivated by outside factors , such as economic factors. We create and consume both, not because we are forced to but because we enjoy it. In an experiment done by professors Gneezy and Rustichini concerning the change in late pick ups at an Isreali daycare centre where one remains the same and the other is given a fine when the child is picked up late. The study showed that when the daycare centre implemented the fine late pick ups rose substantially, whereas the control group remained the same. Shirky argues that the control group, which remained the same, should have been operating without constraints. However, it dealt with social constraints instead of contractual ones. These social constraints in turn created a more generous culture. It is this social obligation that Shirky brings into his argument for Cognitive Surplus as he believes we should should be driven by social constraints and not economic ones to produce more &quot;civic&quot; content.

Shirky ends his talk by stating that although media created with the intent of civic value is obviously more useful than that which is created with the intent of communal value, each are equally valid as they both address our surplus of free time and encourage us to engage with one another and contribute to the wider media landscape.

===James Surowiecki===
James Surowiecki is a journalist and a staff writer at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Much like Lévy his work involving &quot;Collective Intelligence&quot; focuses on; opinions in a group being diverse, these opinions being independent of others within said group and that these opinions and information are specialised.

==== &quot;Wisdom of Crowds&quot;====
Not quite the idealist that Rheingold comes across as with his &quot;smart mobs&quot;, Surowiecki too recognises that &quot;groups are remarkably intelligent&quot; (2004)and that even with a disparity in intelligence and knowledge progress can still be made. Shirky's idea of Cognitive Surplus can be seen to flow in tandem with Surowiecki's thoughts due to the fact that society as a group has no linear intelligence and knowledge. Societies knowledge is diverse and independent but much of it specialised. It is this diversity and independence that allows society to produce both &quot;civic&quot; and &quot;communal&quot; values at the same time. Surowiecki puts this down to the fact that &quot;human beings are not perfectly designed decision makers&quot;(2004). Therefore, producing two forms of values.&lt;ref&gt;Suroweicki, J.(2004). The Wisdom of Crowds. Retrieved 2nd April 2014 from:http://www.asecib.ase.ro/mps/TheWisdomOfCrowds-JamesSurowiecki.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

=== David Gauntlett===
Gauntlett relates cognitive surplus to the concept of collective intelligence. Gauntlett acknowledges that the invention of the World Wide Web has made it easier for people to share and connect with each other.  However, he also attributes this to “Web 2.0”.

====Web 2.0====
WEB 2.0 “describes a particular kind of ethos and approach”.  Web 2.0 pages are used for connecting with others and sharing content&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, T. (2005). ''What Is Web 2.0''. O'Reilly. Retrieved 30 March 2014, from [http://www.oreilly.com/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html www.oreilly.com/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the content that users created before was personal websites, with a focus on searching and reading. Now, instead of creating a personal site, users start a blog which is widely connected and shared. According to Gauntlett, Web 2.0 can be used as a metaphor for any sort of collective activity in which individuals contribute their ideas to create something “bigger than the sum of its parts”. This concept relates to cognitive surplus because the creation and sharing of content creates both civic and political value, as previously described. In fact, Wikipedia itself is often cited as a prime example of cognitive surplus and indeed Web 2.0. Wikipedia exists solely on the basis of voluntary contributions from both experts and others to create the worlds’ largest encyclopaedia. Although it is simply searched and read by many, there are volumes of contributors creating new content every day in their spare time&lt;ref&gt;Gauntlett, D. (2011). ''Making Is Connecting''. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Jaron Lanier===
Jaron Lanier studies digital media and online culture and has written several books on these topics: ''You Are Not a Gadget'' (2010) and ''Who Own the Future?'' (2013). His theories and writings have become influential in the study of digital media.

====''DIGITAL MAOISM: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism''====
In the article ''DIGITAL MAOISM: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism'' (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Lanier, J. (2006) ''DIGITAL MAOISM: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism'', Edge, retrieved 30 March 2014 from http://edge.org/conversation/digital-maoism-the-hazards-of-the-new-online-collectivism&lt;/ref&gt;, Lanier presents certain concepts on online collectivism and the collective intelligence.

====Collective Intelligence====
Lanier takes a different view to Gauntlett over what he calls the new online collectivism. He acknowledges that “in some special cases the collective can be brilliant”, yet “the collective can be stupid too”. He notes that there is a problem with the growth of collaborative sites.  He exemplifies Wikipedia – it has rapidly gained importance through aggregating the content of other sites, and the knowledge of individuals. It seems that for anything to be verified as credible information, it must exist on Wikipedia. For Lanier, he has a problem with this idea, as more and more websites compete to become, what he calls, “the Meta” – “subsuming the identity of all other sites” (Lanier, 2006).

===Howard Rheingold===

Howard Rheingold is a critic, writer and teacher in the field of Digital Media. He discusses the concept and work of Smart Mobs in ''‘Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution’'' (2002). &lt;ref&gt;Rheingold, H. (2002). ''Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
====Smart Mobs====

Smart mobs are defined as a group of people who “use mobile media and computer networks to organize collective actions.” &lt;ref&gt; Rheingold, H. (2002) SMART MOBS, Edge, retrieved 2nd April 2014 from http://edge.org/3rd_culture/rheingold/rheingold_print.html &lt;/ref&gt; The notion of a community coming together to produce and share content for one another ties in with the example of Ushahidi &lt;ref&gt;Ushahidi, retrieved 2nd April 2014 from http://www.ushahidi.com/ &lt;/ref&gt; which Clay Shirky mentions in his TED Talk on Cognitive Surplus. &lt;ref&gt; Shirky, C. (2010). How Cognitive Surplus Will Change The World. Ted Talks. Retrieved 2nd April 2014 from: http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cognitive_surplus_will_change_the_world &lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Rheingold goes on to note the potential of smart mobs when he states, “Communication and computing technologies capable of amplifying human cooperation already appear to be both beneficial and destructive, used by some to support democracy and by others to coordinate terrorist attacks. Already, governments have fallen, subcultures have blossomed, new industries have been born and older industries have launched counterattacks.” &lt;ref&gt; Rheingold, H. (2002) SMART MOBS, Edge, retrieved 2nd April 2014 from http://edge.org/3rd_culture/rheingold/rheingold_print.html &lt;/ref&gt; Although many argue that his views are utopian and may never be realized entirely, the rise of ownership of personal media devices such as mobile phones, tablets and personal computers make it more accessible than ever before for smart mobs to gather information and assemble, either online or in person, for their chosen cause. A further example of this is the ‘Occupy’ movement; a smart mob who convened in agreed places across the globe to protest against government secrecy and capitalism. &lt;ref&gt; Smart Mobs.

===Abigail De Kosnik===
Abigail De Kosnik has studied the concept of &quot;Free&quot; Fan Labor within online cultures. These ideas were presented in the essays ''Interrogating &quot;Free&quot; Fan Labor'' (2013)&lt;ref&gt;De Kosnik, A . (2013)  ''Interrogating &quot;Free&quot; Fan Labor'' , Spreadable Media, retrieved 2 April 2014 from http://spreadablemedia.org/essays/kosnik/&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Fandom as Free Labor'' (2013)&lt;ref&gt;De Kosnik, A. (2013) 'Freedom as Fan Labor' in Scholz, T. (Ed.) ''Digital Labor: The Internet as Playground and Factory''. New York: Routledge. pp. 98-111&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Free Digital Labour====
The way in which we put our collective talents to work is a social issue and not entirely a personal one, but should this hard work be paid? Abigail De Kosnik presents the term 'Fandom as Free Labour. “Free” fan labor means “free” fan labor which is not paid. These fans may revise, rework, remake, and otherwise remix mass-culture texts without dreading legal action or other interference from copyright holders. Fan production is regarded as poor and of little importance or value. (Digital Labor, 2013)

However, Kosnik suggests that fandom is already monetized as the internet is not free space. Many websites that fans work on are driven by fan activity. Fans must produce for these sites and then share and consume what other fans have produced in order for these websites to be successful. Therefore, free digital labour works by fans increasing the worth of mass-media productions without receiving any pay at all. (Digital Labour, 2013)

===Tiziana Terrinova===
Tiziana Terranova also argues the internet depends on free labour. For Terranova examples of free labour that produces value for the internet can be anything from reviews to opinions to songs and images, that people produce everyday on the web. Terranova suggests that “the Internet is about the extraction of value out of continuous, updateable work, and it is extremely labor intensive. It is not enough to produce a good Web site, you need to update it continuously to maintain interest in it and fight off obsolescence.” At the moment the majority of internet users are continually updating their online content therefore keeping their websites fresh and interesting, even though they are unpaid. (Network Culture, 2004)

===Lawrence Lessig===
Lawrence Lessig (Free Culture, 2004) is a law expert based at Stanford who specialises in copyright legal history and creative commons. Lessig claims that a free culture supports and protects creators and innovators. 

Current law in relation to the growth of the web controls not just commercial creativity but of everyone. Its role is less to support creativity and a civic value and more to protect industries against competition therefore an economic value. Lessig states, ‘The technology that preserved the balance of our history – between the uses of our culture that were free and the uses of our culture that were only upon permission – has been undone. The consequence is that we are less and less a free culture, and more and more a permission culture.’ (2004: 8)

===David M. Berry===

David M. Berry is a Reader in Media and Communication at the University of Sussex. His work focuses on the methodological and theoretical challenges of studying digital media. &lt;ref&gt; Profile: David M. Berry. University of Sussex. Retrieved 4th April from http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/125219 &lt;/ref&gt;

====Creative Commons====
Berry has a pessimistic view of Lessig's idea that there should be a &quot;free culture&quot;. He feels that it only labels culture as a &quot;resource&quot;, and it can be easily controlled and owned at the expense of finding the ethical motives behind ownership. Berry argues that the Creative Commons may allow the sharing of culture resources but none of it is &quot;shared in common, nor owned in common, nor accountable to the common itself&quot;. &lt;ref&gt; Berry D. and Moss G.(2006) &quot;The politics of the libre commons.&quot; retrieved 3 April 2014 from http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1403/1321 &lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is down to private individuals to pick and choose when to reuse the commons when they so wish. In turn, blockages in creativity become a problem in the cases of lawyers due to the fact that they become mandatory passing points. This means that the &quot;ethical implications&quot; of the sharing of culture is now being restricted by legal barriers.&lt;ref&gt; Berry D. and Moss G.(2006) &quot;The politics of the libre commons.&quot; retrieved 3 April 2014 from http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1403/1321 &lt;/ref&gt;

==How Cognitive Surplus has Changed the World==

As Clay Shirky focuses on in his TED talk, civic value or civic engagement is one of the most relevant aspects of Cognitive Surplus. Nowadays, with the internet never being more accessible, people are able to communicate faster and more often. The idea of sitting on a couch and watching TV in our spare time is less appealing.  More often than not, people are coming round to the idea of using their free time in a positive way, like raising awareness on social networking sites. 

Using the internet as a prime example, it is an ideal tool to harness Cognitive Surplus. The recent Malaysian Airlines MH370 aircraft that went missing on the 8th of March 2014 caused major controversy all over the world. Mail online posted the article&lt;ref&gt; Webb, S. &amp; Shears, R. (2014) 'Web sleuths claim to have spotted missing Flight MH370: Student posts 'satellite' image showing a jet over the jungle as thousands join online search for plane' Daily Mail Online. Retrieved 3rd April 2014, from  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2583807/Did-Malaysian-fisherman-missing-flight-MH370-flying-low-Gulf-Thailand.html &lt;/ref&gt;&quot;Student posts ‘satellite’ image showing a jet over the jungle as thousands join online search for plane” written by Sam Webb and Richard Shears 10 days after the airliner went missing and it highlights Shirky’s idea that Cognitive Surplus can be used in a productive way. The article describes how thousands joined an online search for the missing flight via analysing satellite images provided by Tomnod - the official map search website set up in the hunt for the Malaysian aircraft.  Volunteers joined online communities on message boards such as Reddit to discuss potential sightings of the plane. Webb and Shears also explain that celebrities have taken to joining in the search, “offering up their suggestions” which received extensive media coverage and in turn informing more of the online search taking place. 

This online search for MH370 is proof that when given the opportunity, people are willing to use their cognitive abilities to work towards a common goal. The problem facing cognitive surplus at this time is the lack of infrastructure to enable it. Additionally, the extensive media coverage and global mystery caused by the disappearance may be an explanation for the surge in motivation for a collaborative effort.  However moving forward, the lack of incentive for people to spend their time in this way is a critical issue that will need to be addressed. As Clay Shirky originally stated: “Once you’ve figured out how to tap the surplus in a way that people care about, others can replicate your technique, over and over, around the world.” (Shirky, 2010)

==Introduction==
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing Crowdsourcing] can be described as &quot;the use of mobile media to incite and organize collective action&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Rheingold, H, (2008) &quot;Mobile Media and Political Collective Action&quot; from Katz, E, Handbook of mobile communication studies pp.225-  239, USA: MIT&lt;/ref&gt; or obtaining useful information for a large and generally varied group of people, the most popular venue being the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_community online community]. This use of crowdsourcing is helpful in the modern digital age because it is able to generate large amounts of feedback or services with minimal effort. Crowdsourcing is effective in generating a wider knowledge of an event such as a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster natural disaster] or a need for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funding funding] as well as compiling small bits of knowledge or labour into a larger pool. For example, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia Wikipedia] is a crowdsourced database itself.

==History of Crowdsourcing==
====The earliest recorded use of Crowdsourcing====
In the mid-19th century the creators of the 'Oxford English Dictionary' began an open search for volunteers to help identify all words in the English language and to provide quotations that exemplify their usage. Over six million volunteers responded over the course of seventy years. &lt;ref&gt; Lanxon, Nate. How the Oxford English Dictionary started out like Wikipedia. 13 January 2011. 04 04 2014 &lt;http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-01/13/the-oxford-english-wiktionary&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;

====Early uses of Crowdsourcing in Business====
Minh Le, a Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver demonstrated how customers could be used to create innovations around existing products. In 1999 Le modified a video game called ''Half-Life'' and turned it into the instantly successful ''Counter-Strike''. Instead of filing a law suit against him for stealing intellectual property, the owners of ''Half-Life'' instead realised that there was profit to be made off the back of it. In 2000 the company officially released ''Counter-Strike'' and by 2003 it had quickly become the most popular game on the Internet with an estimated 2.5 Million players. This success story meant that Crowdsourcing would become a recognised strategy for many more companies in years to come. &lt;ref&gt; Howe, Jeff. Crowdsourcing: How the Power of the Crowd is Driving the Future of Business. New York: The Crown Publishing Group, 2008. &lt;/ref&gt;

Jeff Howe, a popular academic on the subject of Crowdsourcing said in an article named 'The Rise of Crowdsourcing': &quot;Remember outsourcing? Sending jobs to India and China is so 2003. The new pool of cheap labor: everyday people using their spare cycles to create content, solve problems, even do corporate R &amp; D.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Howe, Jeff. &quot;The Rise of Crowdsourcing.&quot; Wired Magazine 14 June 2006: 1-5. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Main Concepts==
The term &quot;crowdsourcing&quot; was first used in 2005 by Jeff Howe and Mark Robinson, editors at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Magazine Wired Magazine] and a later blog post by Howe published in June 2006 gave the term a proper definition. Howe describes crowdsourcing in the following manner:

     Thus the term crowdsourcing (a term, for the record, coined jointly by Mark and myself that day, in a fit of back-and-forth wordplay).
     Simply defined, crowdsourcing represents the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and 
     outsourcing it to an undefined (and generally large) network of people in the form of an open call. This can take the form of peer- 
     production (when the job is performed collaboratively), but is also often undertaken by sole individuals. The crucial prerequisite is 
     the use of the open call format and the large network of potential laborers.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Jeff. &quot;Crowdsourcing: A Definition.&quot; crowdsourcing.com. 02 June 2006 2006.Web. &lt;http://www.crowdsourcing.com/cs/2006/06/crowdsourcing_a.html&gt;.l&lt;/ref&gt;

The key ingredients of crowdsourcing according to a few dozen scholars who have published on the topic, are:

* An organisation that has a task it needs performed.
* A community (crowd) that is willing to perform voluntarily.
* An online environment that allows the work to take place and the community to interact with the organisation.
* Mutual benefit for the organisation and the community. &lt;ref&gt; C.Brabham, Daren. Crowdsourcing. Massachusetts: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2013. &lt;/ref&gt;


Crowdsourcing as a method of compiling information has been gradually becoming more commonplace over the course of the 21st century to the extent that there now exists a multitude of organisations which use crowdsourcing to their advantage.

===Examples and Applications===
Wikipedia itself is one of the most relevant examples of crowdsourcing in modern society. Before crowdsourcing was established as a method of collating information, to construct the contents of an encyclopaedia one would have to consult an enormous variety of experts on a large number of different fields and areas of research. With the emergence of crowdsourcing, however, this task has been greatly simplified. Wikipedia can be accessed and edited by any expert on any subject from almost anywhere on the planet. Thus, information can be contributed to a resource such as Wikipedia with greater ease and hopefully with more accuracy than in the past, through the use of crowdsourcing. This use of [[Digital_Media_and_Culture_Yearbook_2014/Chapter_4:_Cognitive_Surplus|cognitive surplus]] enables many people to project their ideas for the use of a greater group, making information much more available to the general public. 

====Crowdfunding====
Crowdfunding is a branch of crowdsourcing and uses the same basic principles but instead of the participants’ time, it requires their finance. There are multiple types of crowdfunding, such as for a nonprofit campaign or charity- many charities rely on regular payments of small sums of money from thousands of people. Crowdfunding for people in need or those who have done noble things can be particularly effective as it tends to trigger an emotional response from the backer. Such campaigns have a tendency to go viral and may accumulate thousands of backers in a short amount of time. 2012 London Marathon fun runner Claire Squires' [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justgiving Justgiving] donation page has thus far raised in excess of £940,000 from over 80,000 backers.&lt;ref&gt;Squires, Claire. &quot;Claire's page.&quot; justgiving.com. 10 Apr 2012 2012.Web. 4 Apr 2014 &lt;http://www.justgiving.com/Claire-Squires2&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Participating in the marathon to raise money for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans_(charity) Samaritans] charity, she collapsed and died during the race.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Amelia. &quot;Claire Squires donations rocket after London Marathon death.&quot; theguardian.com. 24 Apr 2012 212.Web. 31 Mar 2014 &lt;http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/24/claire-squires-donations-london-marathon&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial crowdfunding campaigns, usually advertised on websites such as [https://www.kickstarter.com/ Kickstarter], [https://www.indiegogo.com/ Indiegogo] or [http://www.rockethub.com/ RocketHub], allow for a number of projects to become commercial success stories. Projects advertised on crowdfunding services rely on the generosity and curiosity of project backers. To entice the public to fund projects, incentives ranging from a tour of company labs to being one of the first to own the finished product are ''sold'' to backers. The more appealing the incentive, the larger the sum of money a backer is asked to donate. Many of the projects advertised on these websites would likely never have received any publicity because of how difficult they would be to fund using conventional means. Without crowdsourcing, these services would be ineffective, lacking the large-group activity that it takes to provide the projects with their funding. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_(watch) Pebble Technology] successfully funded their project using Kickstarter and broke the record for the most money raised using the website. The company is now able to mass produce the Pebble smartwatch thanks to the project’s backers and their product is now on the market in its second iteration.&lt;ref&gt;Byford, Sam. &quot;Kickstarter funding record smashed by $3.3 million of Pebble smartwatch pledges.&quot; theverge.com. 17 Apr 2012 2012.Web. &lt;http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/17/2954187/kickstarter-record-3-3-million-pebble-smartwatch/in/2775692&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowdfunding can lead to startup companies becoming so attractive that the owners are tempted to sell to make a large financial gain, potentially upsetting early backers. This was the case recently when Facebook bought virtual reality technology firm Oculus VR for £1.2bn and Mark Zuckerberg claimed that “virtual reality will be the next social communications platform”.&lt;ref&gt;TKiss, Jemima. &quot;Oculus: Facebook buys virtual reality gaming firm for $2bn.&quot; theguardian.com. 25 Mar 2014 2014.Web. 25 Mar 2014 &lt;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/25/facebook-buys-virtual-reality-gaming-firm-oculus&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Reaction from the early backers were mixed with some against and some in favour.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Facebook buys virtual reality headset start-up for $2bn.&quot; bbc.co.uk/news. 26 Mar 2014 2014.Web. 26 Mar 2014 And understandably so, as expanded upon in the Criticism chapter. &lt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26742625&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This example further demonstrates how crowdfunding can clearly set in motion the development of products that begin with an idea and can become part of a global means of communication, as evidenced by the acquisition of such a product by Facebook, one of the world’s largest technology companies.

====Uses in Science====
Asking large groups of people on the Internet to contribute to scientific research is still somewhat of a novel idea. In recent years however, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science citizen science] projects have taken off as crowdsourcing is used in innovative ways to excel the rate of various scientific research. Galaxy Zoo 2 was one example of a citizen science project, nearly 84,000 volunteers organised over 300,000 galaxies by answering questions about their visual forms. Each galaxy was classified roughly 44 times resulting in accurate classifications.&lt;ref&gt;Willett, Kyle W., et al. &quot;Galaxy Zoo 2: Detailed Morphological Classifications for 304 122 Galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.&quot; Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (2013): 30/03/2014. Web. &lt;http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/09/15/mnras.stt1458.full&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford University is currently running a project, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding@home Folding@home], where users are able to donate their computers’ unused processing power to analyse data collected by the university. The researchers send small packets of data with problems that need solving to users’ computers. Once the problem is solved the data is sent away and swapped for another problem.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;What if you could help find a cure?&quot; folding.stanford.edu. 2013.Web. 4 Apr 2014 &lt;https://folding.stanford.edu/#&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Samsung too is actively engaging with crowdsourcing; collaborating with the University of Vienna in a similar way, the electronics company has created an Android app called [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.samsung.powersleep Samsung Power Sleep]. The app donates users’ smartphones’ unused processing power whilst they sleep to decrypt protein sequences. Cleverly, the app is actually also a fully functional alarm.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;So good while you sleep.&quot; samsung.com.Web. 4 Apr 2013 &lt;http://www.samsung.com/at/microsite/powersleep/en/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of the two aforementioned examples is to find cures for diseases the researcher are investigating. 

====Internet Gaming====
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(software) Steam]'s Greenlight system offers another example of modern day crowdsourcing. Through Greenlight, Steam users are allowed to upload their own games and game-related content for other users to access and use. As a result of this, the most popular Greenlight projects will be approved and given further exposure to the Steam community. Thus, Greenlight acts as a sort of filter which determines what kind of games and features of Steam are positively received by its users. Simultaneously, Steam developers are able to see what is unpopular, and alter the software in order to best suit its users' needs and demands.

==== Disaster Relief====
Crowdsourcing does not necessarily require an online community. However, it would be accurate to assume that in many cases consulting a large group of people is most efficiently achieved using the Internet. One recent large-scale crowdsourcing effort- the search for a missing [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370 Malaysian Airlines Flight 370] recruited in excess of 150,000 volunteers who combed thorough satellite imagery provided by DigitalGlobe. Volunteers visited [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomnod Tomnod], a crowdsourcing website provided by DigitalGlobe dedicated to identifying physical objects from satellite imagery to aid in search and rescue efforts. &lt;ref&gt;Martinez, Michael. &quot;Crowdsourcing search for Malaysian plane goes viral, but no luck so far.&quot; 2014.Web. &lt;http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/12/us/malaysia-airlines-plane-crowdsourcing-search/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The volunteers were able to tag objects of interest, such as rafts and oil slicks, from computers around the world. Tagged objects would be examined further and potentially forwarded to the Department of Civil Aviation. Similarly, after [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy hurricane Sandy], a large-scale damage assessment had to be carried out to direct response agencies. The Civil Air Patrol and The Federal Emergency Management Agency made 35,000 images of the affected areas public for assessment. 6,717 public volunteers rated damages on a scale of little/no damage; medium damage; or heavy damage. Interestingly, the report notes that conventionally the data would have been analysed in the same way, (also using crowdsourcing) but the analysers would have been paid. $3,000 was saved thanks to the goodwill of the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Munro, Rober, Schuyler Erle, and Tyler Schnoebelen. Aerial Damage Assessment for Hurricane Sandy. Quality Analysis After Action Report for the  Crowdsourced Aerial Imagery Assessment  Following Hurricane Sandy., 2013. 30/04/2014. Web. &lt;http://idibon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ISCRAM2013_Paper.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Crowdsourcing thus knows no boundaries in the digital age and can be legitimately called upon to help save lives. These examples explain the practice of crowdsourcing particularly well, without the combined efforts of thousands of willing volunteers, experts would likely take months to analyse the hundreds of kilometres worth of satellite imagery.

==Criticism==
Though crowdsourcing may be an easier and more accessible way to gain the opinion of many, it also presents problems. As computer scientist Jaron Lanier writes, &quot;I have attempted to retire from directing films in the alternative universe that is the Wikipedia a number of times, but somebody always overrules me. Every time my Wikipedia entry is corrected, within a day I'm turned into a film director again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://edge.org/conversation/digital-maoism-the-hazards-of-the-new-online-collectivism&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Lanier himself attempted to correct his own Wikipedia page and failed is a testament to the potential hazards of crowdsourcing. Incorrect information can be spread quickly and over large masses of people, causing a rumour to be believed and therefore effecting the quality of information used in various ways. Another related idea of crowdsourcing or using mass media negatively is that &quot;they can be used to stifle, misdirect, and demoralize those who would otherwise be involved in these activities&quot; (Rheingold, p. 17) meaning that any useful participants in certain situations can be diffused with the same ease that they can be rallied.

===Junction===
Junction is a film investment company which has been described as &quot;Kickstarter for the rich.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Child, Ben. &quot;Tom Hanks film seeks crowdfunding via 'Kickstarter for the rich' site.&quot; theguardian.com 27 March 2014. Web. Retrieved 2 April 2014. &lt;http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/27/tom-hanks-film-crowdfunding-kickstarter-junction&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to media news website [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wrap The Wrap], Junction is only available to people with an annual income of over $200,000 or a net worth of at least $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;Zakarin, Jordan. &quot;New Crowdfunding Site Hosts Big Names – Tom Hanks Film Among First Projects.&quot; thewrap.com. 26 March 2014. Web. Retrieved 2 April 2014. &lt;http://www.thewrap.com/new-crowdfunding-platform-launches-hosting-campaigns-tom-hanks-aaron-paul-films/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While this approach will certainly allow Junction to pursue their projects more successfully, it can be criticised for not following the usual crowdsourcing pattern because of its exclusivity. One of the most important attributes of crowdsourcing is that it is open to everyone, a universal method of achieving goals. However Junction's method limits its members, allowing only wealthy donors. It can be argued that this is not only a flawed crowdsourcing technique, but also discriminatory towards people who may not have a high enough income.

===Going commercial===
The acquisition of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_VR Oculus VR] by Facebook was aforementioned in relation to crowdfunding leading to the development of products which could have considerable impacts on society. Success stories such as these, however, raise questions of ownership and recognition. The Oculus Rift Kickstarter page as an example had 9,522 backers who collectively financed the project with $2,437,429.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Oculus Rift: Step Into the Game.&quot; kickstarter.com. 28 Mar 2014 2014.Web. Kickstarter. 3 Apr 2014 &lt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game/posts&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Just over a year a half after the project was successfully funded, Facebook is to acquire Oculus VR in a $2 billion valuation of the virtual reality technology company.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Facebook to Acquire Oculus.&quot; newsroom.fb.com. 25 Mar 2014 2014.Web. 3 Apr 2014 &lt;http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2014/03/facebook-to-acquire-oculus/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; I question the ethicality of this deal; selling out is unlikely to be seen in a positive light by the backers of the Kickstarter project. Backers of these projects support the projects financially but often may not get any real value from doing so- except the satisfaction of helping a startup and the promise of an eventual product. In the case of Oculus VR, many backers are left with T-shirts and posters; comparatively underwhelming merchandise from a company which would likely not have succeeded without the backers' initial support. Crowdfunding therefore can be a fickle undertaking with backers not having any controlling interest (thus influence) in the projects they choose to fund. It is understandable how backers can feel left high and dry while the owners of the projects become wealthy and successful.

==Endorsement==
Overwhelmingly, crowdsourcing has a great value in the modern society and is used nearly every day. 
Technology has allowed humankind to advance greatly, joining us in previously unknown ways. The ability to have real-time conversations with others across the world is an innovation that has evolved rapidly over the last decade. It's easy to see how technology has &quot;the power to persuade and communicate, joined with the power to organise and coordinate, multiplied by the three billion mobile telephones in the world today poses a disruptive political potential that could equal or surpass that of the printing press, landline telephone, television or the Internet.&quot; (Rheingold, pp. 225-226). In recent elections, the ability to crowdsource has dramatically changed the results of a nation. In Ghana, cell phones were used to report fraud and illegal actions taken by the politicians themselves, or voters who wished to rig the results. Authorities can quickly become involved in matters where crowdsourcing is used because the more people that report an incident, the higher the chance that actions will be taken to remedy the situation, helping to keep governments and authorities honest by being unable to deny that events have taken place. Large companies can also use crowdsourcing to their advantage. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lush_(company) Lush ], a company devoted to quality handmade cosmetic products is involved in many charities such as [http://www.foxproject.org.uk/ The Fox Project], which aims to reintroduce foxes into the UK wilds. By buying a specific product by Lush, the charity benefits. More people know about the companies than the charities, therefore crowdsourcing can be a bolster to funds by raising awareness through the purchase of popular products.

==Future of Crowdsourcing==
In 2012 reports showed that there was an estimated 2,405,518,376 people worldwide with access to the Internet. This data indicates that there was a 556.4% increase in the number of Internet users in just two years. &lt;ref&gt; Group, Miniwatts Marketing. Internet World Stats: Usage and Population Statistics. 21 March 2014. 04 April 2014 &lt;http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt; Mark Prensky coined the term &quot;digital native&quot; to describe the 'cohorts that are coming of age in the Internet era'. It is a popular belief amongst academics that we are fast approaching &quot;the crowdsourcing generation, a demographic that is perfectly adapted to a future in which online communication will supplant the conventional corporation.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Howe, Jeff. Crowdsourcing: How the Power of the Crowd is Driving the Future of Business. New York: The Crown Publishing Group, 2008. &lt;/ref&gt;

Jeff Howe expands on the idea of the ‘digital native’ by describing what he believes will happen in the future: “Crowdsourcing has already wreaked upheaval in a few select fields… this is because the crowd has made a once scarce resource abundant. As digital natives continue to acquire the skills it takes to build, design, and create, the scarcity of other commodities will also decline, posing great challenges to the companies that traffic in them.” &lt;ref&gt; Howe, Jeff. &quot;How the Power of the Crowd is Driving the Future of Business&quot;. London: Business Books, 2009. Print. &lt;/ref&gt;  He uses the example of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_photography stock photography] as where the crowd has caused a decline in scarcity to occur. Graphic designers found it cheaper to share images with each other, which allowed those who took photos or designed images as a hobby to also share their work– hence the need for specialists to provide stock photography declined, and the work of the hobbyists (the crowd) became an abundant resource. According to Howe, companies could face challenges such as picking the right crowd to target– he says that over a billion people are using the Internet so to attract the right people, companies need to be very selective; making sure they don’t see the crowd as a cheap workforce. Howe argues that people’s busy lives mean they would not want to spend a long time doing something unpaid for a business; having to trawl through bad contributions to get to the good ones –not all the thousands of contributions will work; and [http://www.bizbriefings.com/Samples/IntInst%20---%20Crowdsourcing.PDF others]. &lt;ref&gt; Howe, Jeff. &quot;CROWDSOURCING Why the Power of the Crowd is Driving the Future of Business.&quot; Summaries.Com. 2008. Web. 4 Apr 2014 p.9&lt;http://www.bizbriefings.com/Samples/IntInst%20---%20Crowdsourcing.PDF&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  He ends his argument about what could happen in the future by citing a quote from Thomas Malone: “Obsolescence isn’t a new phenomenon. Kids who grew up with running water wouldn’t know how to work a hand pump, and in this new world we’re entering, a lot of what’s familiar will go the way of the hand-pump.” &lt;ref&gt; Howe, Jeff. 2009. p277 &lt;/ref&gt; Basically, we could be moving into a future where the crowd is the norm for business and contemporary methods will cease to exist.

&amp;nbsp;
;Purpose and Usage
This template (shown at right below and coupled with the generic Fundamentals header template) expresses a right sidebar quick navigation template of handy links aimed at Trainz Newbies with a default on Table of contents bounded by the same table element located beneath. 
;Modes and parameters
* This template is usually included by inclusion via {{tl|TRS-hdrbox}} via another 'Division' Trainz Header template, but is produced separately so it a can be placed on appropriate intermediate and advanced topic pages in [[Trainz]].
* When defined by the ''named parameters ''''&lt;nowiki&gt;|noTOC= or |inhibitTOC=&lt;/nowiki&gt;''anything''''', the template ''suppresses generation of a TOC on a page by providing the [[mw:Help:Magic_words#Behavior_switches|Wikimedia magic word]] &lt;nowiki&gt;'__NOTOC__'&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This can be overridden by expressing &lt;nowiki&gt;'__FORCETOC__'&lt;/nowiki&gt; to manifest a TOC in a better place, or leave the page without one. Extremely short pages or those with just a few sections should use this option for they look unprofessional with a TOC.
* The TOC behaviour in Wikimarkup expresses a TOC only where the default processing calculates, or where the first &lt;nowiki&gt;'__TOC__'&lt;/nowiki&gt; magic word is emplaced. This behavior allows a long page to include several {{TG|I|instance}}s of the template on longer pages.

'''A contagious joy transmitting health to children''' &lt;br /&gt;
Project implemented by the [[w:Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service|Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service]] &lt;br /&gt;
Uttar Pradesh, India,  March 2014 &lt;br /&gt;
----

Sometimes, communities are sharply divided between &quot;modernists&quot; that advocate for social change and &quot;traditionalists&quot;, that favour a return to fundamental religious values and oppose all social reforms that are not in harmony with orthodox doctrines.  

Such an old ideological divide is today being bridged by organizations active in social dialogue and building awareness that &quot;change&quot; and &quot;continuity&quot; are two sides of [[Development Cooperation Handbook/Defining Development|development]].  In their vision, science and spirituality are not seen as reciprocally contrasting but as different perspectives that integrate each other. 

The Indian State of Uttar Pradesh is ranked as one of the least developed regions of Asia:  Here, 1 in every 2 women is illiterate; women's life expectancy is just 59 years. And in rural areas, 1 out of 10 children die before reaching the age of one. 

We visited the [[w:Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service| Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service]], where besides spiritual and welfare activities that are typical of the Ramaskrishna Missions, a child health care programme is being successfully managed and has become a model for the whole region.  

The Ramakrishna Mission is an Indian organisation, founded in 1897 by Vivekananda, a former rationalist, who then became a disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahansa, an important Hindu mystic from Bengal. The Mission headquarters are located near Kolkata in eastern India, but associated centres exist across the world.

One of the fundamental principles of the Organization is that selfless service to others is a means for self realization; and that awareness is the primary health determinant for the individual and for the community.

The health care and education programme of the Mission in Varanasi extends beyond the city to serve a population of more than 60,000 persons living in more than 30 villages across the districts of  Mirzapur, Sonbhadra and Azamgadh.  Its activities include promoting good health, hygiene, sanitation and nutrition education amongst women and children in schools and villages.

There are Community Health Workers that live in the villages, advise the population where, when and how they can get medical and social assistance and report about emergencies in their villages. Mobile health clinics regularly visit these villages, conducting basic medical diagnosis, giving medical advice and distributing free medicines.
 
They build awareness among women on their rights and duties and how they can advocate for it, as individuals, as groups and as a community. They also train teachers for improving learning processes in schools and for making schools more child-friendly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;Periodic trends are specific patterns that are present in the periodic table, which illustrate different aspects of a certain element, including its size and its properties with electrons. When comparing the properties of the chemical elements, recurring ('periodic') trends are apparent. This led to the creation of the periodic table as a useful way to display the elements and rationalize their behavior. When laid out in tabular form, many trends in properties can be observed to increase or decrease as one progresses along a row or column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These period trends can be explained by theories of atomic structure. The elements are laid out in order of increasing atomic number, which represents increasing positive charge in the atomic nucleus. Negative electrons are arranged in orbitals around the nucleus; recurring properties are due to recurring configurations of these electrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main periodic trends include: electronegativity, ionization energy, electron affinity, atomic radius, melting point, and metallic character. The periodic trends that arise from the arrangement of the periodic table provide chemists with an invaluable tool to quickly predict an element's properties. These trends exist because of the similar atomic structure of the elements within their respective group families or period and the periodic nature of the elements.&lt;/p&gt;

==Introduction==
'''Surveyor''' is the built-in ''world editing tool'' of the three [[Trainz]] {{wp|Graphical user interface}} operating environments. Like the Windows application {{TL|Content Manager}} the three GUIs draw on the Trainz local data base for asset information. Most versions of Trainz include the Surveyor module - the notable exceptions are the few &quot;driver only&quot; introductory products such as the 2005 release [[Trainz/Versions#Trainz_Driver|Trainz Driver]]. The {{TA|Route and Session Creation}} pages provides details on the fine points of how build {{TL|routes}} and their associated gameplay {{TL|session rules|sessions}} using Surveyor, whereas this module will focus on the basics with a number of examples of how to get skilled so you can fly on making your own dream railway with a different method: we're going to provide some projects and start you out modifying a stock route the way most of us learned to get good with Surveyor.

{{TrainzTip|The first thing to realize is Trainz protects you from boneheaded gaffs, and will automatically clone a built-in route should you enter one and modify it. Thereafter, it will be listed in your local content in CM with your own Trainz KUID as part of it's identifier. This forced SAVE AS protects you from overwriting the release version's stock content.
* It does not protect you from over writing yourself. Do a save as BEFORE making major changes to your route and practice suffixing a version to the name. You can weed them out later as per {{TA|Removing Unwanted Assets}}.
}}
==Tools and modes==
Surveyor has seven major tools that are accessable via hot key combinations and mouse click combinations and from the earliest Trainz Beta 0.9 release until the latest, these differ only in the sixth tab which until layers were introduced in TS2010 was for World control settings like clouds, water appearance, season of the year, time of day and the world origin. Most of these are intermediate controls that for now either will already be set up (since we're going to Look, modify, learn not create from scratch. 
* For now suffice it to say the world controls have been moved off the {{kp|F6}} tab and put into the surveyor options menu in favor of a new powerful mode tool, the Layer association tab/tool on the {{kp|F6}} tab instead.
* This tool let's the user associate assets on either a session definition (Navigation waypoints called {{TG|T|trackmarks}}, things a session Rule might test like  {{TG|T|triggers}} and {{TL|rolling stock}} in {{TG|C|consist}}s) which are integral to making up a given scenarios needs) or '''''on the 'route/map/layout'''' (track, scenery items, landscape features, interactive industries like train stations, yards, switching, and so on and so on).

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;General chemistry (sometimes called &quot;gen chem&quot; for short) is a course often taught at the high school and introductory university level. It is intended to serve as a broad introduction to a variety of concepts in chemistry and is widely taught. At the university level, it is also sometimes used as a &quot;weed out&quot; course for disciplines (sometimes related, sometimes not) which are perceived to require a high level of intellectual rigor or large course loads. It is also one of the few chemistry courses in most universities that does not explicitly explore a particular discipline such as organic chemistry or analytical chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General chemistry courses typically introduce concepts such as stoichiometry, prediction of reaction products, thermodynamics, nuclear chemistry, electrochemistry, chemical kinetics, and many of the rudiments of physical chemistry. Though the list of subjects covered is typically broad, leading some to criticize both the class and the discipline as encouraging memorization, most general chemistry courses are firmly grounded in several fundamental physical rules for which the primary challenge is understanding when the rules are applicable.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Concepts Taught ===
# '''Properties of Matter''': An explanation of the most fundamental concept in chemistry: ''matter''.
# '''Atomic Structure''': While technically in the domain of physics, ''atoms'' determine the behavior of matter, making them a necessary starting point for any discussion of chemistry.
# '''Compounds and Bonding''': Chemical ''bonding'' is introduced, which explains how less than one hundred naturally-occurring elements can combine to form all the different compounds that fill our world.
# '''Chemical Reactions''': Things get interesting once chemical ''reactions'' start making and breaking bonds.
# '''Aqueous Solutions''': Substances ''dissolved'' in water have special properties.  This is when ''acids and bases'' are introduced.
# '''Phases of Matter''': A detailed look at the ''organization of substances'', with particular focus on ''gases''.
# '''Chemical Equilibria''': Chemical reactions don't go on forever.  ''Equilibrium'' is the balance that reactions seek to achieve.
# '''Chemical Kinetics''': ''Kinetics'' explain why it takes years for an iron nail to rust, but only a split second for a hydrogen-filled hot air balloon to explode.
# '''Thermodynamics''': Two things decide which reactions can occur and which reactions cannot: heat and chaos.  Or ''enthalpy and entropy'', as they are called in thermodynamics
# '''Chemistries of Various Elements''':  An exploration of the ''elements'' that make up all substance.  Includes an introduction to ''nuclear chemistry'' and carbon, the essence of ''organic chemistry''.</text>

A '''crystal''' or '''crystalline solid''' is a [[solid]] material whose constituent [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, or [[ion]]s are arranged in an [[order and disorder (physics)|ordered]] pattern extending in all three [[spatial dimensions]]. In addition to their microscopic structure, large crystals are usually identifiable by their macroscopic geometrical shape, consisting of flat faces with specific, characteristic orientations.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The scientific study of crystals and crystal formation is known as [[crystallography]]. The process of crystal formation via mechanisms of [[crystal growth]] is called [[crystallization]] or [[solidification]].

Examples of large crystals include [[snowflake]]s, [[diamond]]s, and table [[salt]]. Most inorganic solids are not crystals but [[polycrystal]]s, i.e. many microscopic crystals fused together into a single solid. Examples of polycrystals include most metals, rocks, ceramics, and ice. A third category of solids is [[amorphous]] solids, where the atoms have no periodic structure whatsoever. Examples of amorphous solids include [[glass]], [[wax]], and many [[plastic]]s.

===Crystal structure (microscopic)===

The scientific definition of a &quot;crystal&quot; is based on the microscopic arrangement of atoms inside it, called the [[crystal structure]]. A crystal is a solid where the atoms form a periodic arrangement. ([[Quasicrystal]]s are an exception, see [[#Quasicrystals|below]].)

Not all solids are crystals. For example, when liquid water starts freezing, the phase change begins with small ice crystals that grow until they fuse, forming a ''[[polycrystalline]]'' structure. In the final block of ice, each of the small crystals (called &quot;[[crystallite]]s&quot; or &quot;grains&quot;) is a true crystal with a periodic arrangement of atoms, but the whole polycrystal does ''not'' have a periodic arrangement of atoms, because the periodic pattern is broken at the [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]]. Most macroscopic [[inorganic]] solids are polycrystalline, including almost all [[metal]]s, [[ceramic]]s, [[ice]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], etc. Solids that are neither crystalline nor polycrystalline, such as [[glass]], are called ''[[amorphous solid]]s'', also called [[glass]]y, vitreous, or noncrystalline. These have no periodic order, even microscopically. There are distinct differences between crystalline solids and amorphous solids: most notably, the process of forming a glass does not release the [[latent heat of fusion]], but forming a crystal does.

A crystal structure (an arrangement of atoms in a crystal) is characterized by its ''unit cell'', a small imaginary box containing one or more atoms in a specific spatial arrangement. The unit cells are [[honeycomb (geometry)|stacked]] in three-dimensional space to form the crystal.

The [[crystal structure|symmetry of a crystal]] is constrained by the requirement that the unit cells stack perfectly with no gaps. There are 219 possible crystal symmetries, called [[Space group|crystallographic space groups]]. These are grouped into 7 [[crystal system]]s, such as [[cubic crystal system]] (where the crystals may form cubes or rectangular boxes, such as [[halite]] shown at right) or [[hexagonal crystal system]] (where the crystals may form hexagons, such as [[Ice Ih|ordinary water ice]]).

===Crystal faces and shapes===
[[File:Crystal facet formation.svg|thumb|350px|As a [[halite]] crystal is growing, new atoms can very easily attach to the parts of the surface with rough atomic-scale structure and many [[dangling bonds]]. Therefore these parts of the crystal grow out very quickly (yellow arrows). Eventually, the whole surface consists of smooth, [[surface energy|stable]] faces, where new atoms cannot as easily attach themselves.]]
Crystals are commonly recognized by their shape, consisting of flat faces with sharp angles. These shape characteristics are not ''necessary'' for a crystal—a crystal is scientifically defined by its microscopic atomic arrangement, not its macroscopic shape—but the characteristic macroscopic shape is often present and easy to see.

[[Euhedral]] crystals are those with obvious, well-formed flat faces. [[Anhedral (petrology)|Anhedral]] crystals do not, usually because the crystal is one grain in a polycrystalline solid.

The flat faces (also called [[facet]]s) of a [[euhedral]] crystal are oriented in a specific way relative to the underlying [[crystal structure|atomic arrangement of the crystal]]: They are [[plane (mathematics)|planes]] of relatively low [[Miller index]].&lt;ref&gt;''The surface science of metal oxides'', by Victor E. Henrich, P. A. Cox, page 28, [http://books.google.com/books?id=X6x1MmPisKkC&amp;pg=PA2 google books link]&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs because some surface orientations are more stable than others (lower [[surface energy]]). As a crystal grows, new atoms attach easily to the rougher and less stable parts of the surface, but less easily to the flat, stable surfaces. Therefore, the flat surfaces tend to grow larger and smoother, until the whole crystal surface consists of these plane surfaces. (See diagram on right.)

One of the oldest techniques in the science of [[crystallography]] consists of measuring the three-dimensional orientations of the faces of a crystal, and using them to infer the underlying [[crystal system|crystal symmetry]].

[[Crystal habit|A crystal's habit]] is its visible external shape. This is determined by the [[crystal structure]] (which restricts the possible facet orientations), the specific crystal chemistry and bonding (which may favor some facet types over others), and the conditions under which the crystal formed.

===Occurrence in nature===
[[File:Ice crystals.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ice]] crystals.]]

'''Rocks'''
By volume and weight, the largest concentrations of crystals in the earth are part of the Earth's solid bedrock.

Some crystals have formed by [[magmatic]] and [[metamorphic]] processes, giving origin to large masses of crystalline [[rock (geology)|rock]]. The vast majority of [[igneous rocks]] are formed from molten magma and the degree of crystallization depends primarily on the conditions under which they solidified. Such rocks as [[granite]], which have cooled very slowly and under great pressures, have completely crystallized; but many kinds of [[lava]] were poured out at the surface and cooled very rapidly, and in this latter group a small amount of amorphous or [[glass]]y matter is common. Other crystalline rocks, the metamorphic rocks such as [[marble]]s, [[mica-schist]]s and [[quartzite]]s, are recrystallized. This means that they were at first fragmental rocks like [[limestone]], [[shale]] and [[sandstone]] and have never been in a [[molten]] condition nor entirely in solution, but the high temperature and pressure conditions of [[metamorphism]] have acted on them by erasing their original structures and inducing recrystallization in the solid state.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|title=Petrology |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other rock crystals have formed out of precipitation from fluids, commonly water, to form [[druse (geology)|druse]]s or [[quartz]] veins.
The [[evaporite]]s such as [[halite]], [[gypsum]] and some limestones have been deposited from aqueous solution, mostly owing to [[evaporation]] in arid climates.

'''Ice'''
Water-based [[ice]] in the form of [[snow]], [[sea ice]] and [[glacier]]s is a very common manifestation of crystalline or polycrystalline matter on Earth. A single [[snowflake]] is typically a single crystal, while an [[ice cube]] is a [[polycrystal]].

===Organigenic crystals===
Many living [[organisms]] are able to produce crystals, for example [[calcite]] and [[aragonite]] in the case of most [[mollusc]]s or [[hydroxylapatite]] in the case of [[vertebrate]]s.</text>

=Lighting Suzanne:  Introductory one lamp lighting= 

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.69}}

If you have followed all these tutorials you now have quite a library of images:  A simple figure with a hat, a penguin, a volcano, a jeep and several goblets, not to mention dice, a head and a house! To show them off to best effect, you need to experiment with lighting.

'''Lighting''' is a complex subject, as any photographer can tell you.  Blender allows many different arrangements and numbers of lamps to be used in combination to light your image.  For this introductory tutorial, let us consider single lamp lighting and do some experiments to see how it works. (In later sections more complicated lighting is covered: [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Basic Lighting Rigs|Lighting Rigs]].)

__TOC__

==Suzanne, Our Star==

We need an object to light. Who better than Blender's favorite resident simian, Suzanne!  Open the default startup page.  Delete {{B3D:N2P/Do|XKEY}} the default  cube.   Be sure the 3D cursor is at the origin.  Add a plane.   ''Add&gt;Mesh&gt;Plane'',  scale it up nice and large {{B3D:N2P/Do|SKEY}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|2KEY}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|0KEY}}, and in the  Properties panel (which by default is the lower right panel) add a material [[File:Blender255MaterialContextButton.png ]] color such as light blue that will render well.  In that same panel be sure that under SHADOW the Receive box is checked.

Now Add Suzanne, the famous monkey.  ''Add&gt;Mesh&gt;Monkey''.  Move her up about 1.5 Blender units so she is above the plane but close to it.  {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|1KEY}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|.KEY}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|5KEY}}. Rotate her around the Z axis so she is facing the Right View.  {{B3D:N2P/Do|R}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|9KEY}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|0KEY}}.  Add a material [[File: Blender255MaterialContextButton.png ]] color such as red (red is my favorite color).

==The default light==

[[Image:  L01 default quad.png|thumb|left|300 px|Default Quad view]][[Image:  L02 first render.png|thumb|right|300 px|First Render]] Now lets change to the Quad view, which you should refer to extensively throughout this tutorial.  Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|QKEY}} to bring up this view.  You now have the TOP, FRONT and RIGHT ORTHO views. In the top right you will see your camera view.  Suzanne should be seen in 3/4 profile just above the plane.  If not, rotate and scroll in or out until she is.  Then I suggest you bring up the object panel {{B3D:N2P/Do|NKEY}}, scroll down to View and put a check next to Lock Camera To View.

In the outline panel, select Lamp. You will see the default lamp position.  In Ortho Quad view, we can see that the default lamp is up, in front of and slightly to the right of Suzanne as she now faces. If you don't see it, scroll out in each view window until the lamp shows up as a point with a double dashed circle around it. 

When your screen looks like the screenshot, render for the first time to get a good image of Suzanne and her shadow.

==Types of lamps==
Lamp should still be selected in the Outline panel.  In the Properties panel, click the [[File:Blender-2.5_lamp_radio_button.png]] button to see the properties of the light.  The default lamp is a POINT lamp with ENERGY 1.000.  Let's experiment with those settings.  First, click in turn each of the different kinds of lamp, SUN, SPOT, HEMI and AREA, and render after each one.  You can see that each of the light types has its own characteristics.  With the light in the default position, your images should look like this:

[[Image: A01 DEFAULTS.png|thumb|center|800 px|Comparison of light types.]]



===Point lamp===

This is the default type. The light rays are assumed to originate in a single point and spread from there.  At the default value of ENERGY 1.000 is not very bright and covers a limited area.  It casts a good sharp shadow.  Point is the basic general purpose lighting in Blender.  Advanced lighting rigs will frequently use several point lights with different settings.

===Sun===

The sun is assumed to be infinitly high in the sky so its rays are all parallel.  It puts out a bright light and casts heavy shadows.  It is the lighting type of choice for outdoor scenes but can also be used to good effect indoor.

===Spot===

The Spot lamp behaves very much like a theatrical spotlight (DUH).  It casts a limited circle of light. Within the circle it is bright and casts a heavy shadow, but outside the circle all is dark.  (Note: Under the Shadow setting, the Spot lamp is the only one that can cast a Buffer shadow. The distinction is subtle but important in some more advanced applications.)

===Hemi===

The Hemi lamp resembles lights photographers choose for indoor shots.  It is the only kind of light that does not cast shadows.  It gives a very bright lighting that is relatively even over the entire picture.

===Area===

This light behaves more like a flood light, as if the area is flooded with it.  It is extremely bright and casts a very heavy shadow.

==Light Energy==

Each type of light has its own brightness.  This is controlled mostly by the ENERGY setting of the light.  Obviously less energy reduces the amount of light, more energy increases it. Still in the Properties panel, try different settings for ENERGY and see how it affects the image.

Begin with energy increased to 2.000.  Render each type of lamp.   We can see that reacts differently to the energy settings.  Area is almost too bright at Energy 2.000, while Point and Spot are just reaching nice bright levels.  Sun is ... Sun.  Remember that it is infinitely far away and its rays are parallel.  Little changes with the Sun.  Now reduce energy to 0.300 and render each type of lamp.  Point and spot at these settings are way too dim, while Area becomes a very useable setting.

[[File:A02 combined energy.png|thumb|center|800 px|Lighting varying energy settings]]

==Distance and Height==

The distance of the lamp also affects brightness and its position affects several things, particularly including the shadows.  In the quad view, grab the default lamp and raise it up quite high, say to Z=25.  The light falls off with distance, so point becomes very dark.  The spot area increases with distance so the circle in the spot example is now quite large.  The Sun ... well, the sun was infinitely far away already, remember?  The shadow cast by the sun does not change, and hemi still casts no shadow.  But the shadow cast by the other three lights moves considerably and is now almost directly under Suzanne.

Lower the lamp to Z=3, placing it almost directly at a level with the subject.  Both the distance and the angle of light change.  The brightness increases, the size of the spot circle shrinks, and now the shadow is long and far behind the subject, except, of course, for the Sun which remains infinitely far away and casts parallel rays.

[[File:A04 combined height.png|thumb|center|800 px|Effects of height on lighting]]

==Rotation==

[[File:L11 rotations.png|thumb|right|400 px|Effects of Rotation on lighting]]

The last setting we will consider in this lesson is Rotation. The Point light cannot be rotated since it is equal in all directions.  Each of the others reacts differently to being rotated.

The Sun finally shows a different effect when rotated.  I am not sure how Blender interprets the difference between location and rotation for the Sun.  It seems rather counter intuitive. The sun when rotated seems to me to behave as if it has been moved.  But in any case you can see that the shadow and the lighting show a distinct difference.

The Spot behaves very much like a real spotlight.  Its circle of light moves with the rotation and frames whatever it is pointed at.

The Hemi lamp also finally shows a bit of difference.  Even pointing it entirely way from the subject still lets light leak through it and give that same shadowless flat lighting.

The Area lamp has its characteristic brightness over a large field, and then suddenly cuts off in to total blackness. The contrast is very striking.

==Experiment!==

You can experiment with other placements of the light, and see the effects on the illumination and the shadow.  There is an almost infinite variety of ways to light a Blender image, and this is just with a single lamp.  Multiple lamp setups increase the variety many fold as will be seen in the Advanced portion of this tutorial.

==Note on Transparency==

[[file:L09A make transparent.png|thumb|left|300 px|Where does that shadow come from?]][[file:L10 receive transp.png|thumb|right|300 px|Plane Shadows set to Receive Transparency]]
A special case of lighting is transparent objects. What sort of a shadow do transparent objects cast?  You can try an experiment.  Click on Suzanne to select her.  Now in the Material panel [[File: Blender255MaterialContextButton.png ]] scroll down to Transparency and put a check in the box.  Just below that is the Alpha setting, which controls the amount of transparency, with 1.000 being fully opaque and 0.000 being completely transparent to the point of invisibility.  Lets try setting it to 0.200 for an almost glassy effect.  Render your view, and then ask yourself, why does this glassy object still cast a thick black shadow in the render?

The answer is not in Suzanne, but in the settings for the plane which is her background.  Recall that we checked Receive under shadows for that plane. But go back to the properties panel for the plane, and notice that there is another check box under Shadows that says Receive Transparent.  By default, to save rendering time, Blender assumes that all objects block light equally.  Only if that box is checked does it make a check for transparency in the object casting the shadow.  Now render your view and you will see that the shadow is suitably glassy.

Experiment with this one.  Try different types of lamp (Area is so strong that transparent objects effectively disappear) and different values for the alpha setting.  You might want to remove the color material from Suzanne and see what effect that has.

==Note on World Lighting==

It is not absolutely necessary to use any lamp source.  In the World panel [[File:Blender255WorldContextButton.png]] you will find several lighting settings that simply produce light throughout the scene without any particular source.  Experiment with Environment Lighting and Indirect Lighting and see the effects they produce.

==Trainz Notations==
This special glossary page will assist the new reader in getting the gist of Trainz-speak. It is a terse set of other terms that are usually more fully elaborated on in the {{TL|Glossary}} and at times, given topic pages all their own for in depth exposition.

{{Trainz-stub}}

===Keypress notations===
Many Trainz functions are accessed using the mouse or hotkeys. The later change depending upon which module of the software suite is active, though commonality of purpose is preserved from application to application when there is overlap. Mostly there isn't.

==Standard Abbreviations==
* ''in this book '' &amp;mdash;means may see elsewhere, but this is what is meant here.
* ''general shorthand'' &amp;mdash;means seen often on the web forums too.
* '''Kc:, Kd:, Ks:''' Keys, usu. Hotkeys respectively in CM, Driver (DVR) or Surveyor (SUR)

Consequently, such images are not part of any cloned asset.

|&amp;nbsp;  '''EDR''' &amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;'''Extended database repair'''&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;Selecting''' EDR''' from the CM {{kp|ALT|F7}} hotkey or options menu launches the big brother of the {{TN|Q|QDR}}, which forces a full thorough database self-audit, including checking installed assets, and record like ..UserData\Originals, backups and etcetera.
* It takes quite a while as a result, so if tempted, make sure you have no plans for the computer ''for up to half a day''; comparatively the EDR takes a much greater time, even with no added content on a system, for it not only rebuilds the assets.tdx index file but also rechecks validity of content, looking for faults. 
In particular, disable anti-virus and Mal-ware checking and especially disable any auto updates which might reboot the system with disastrous results to Trainz. Best run overnight, verify your scheduler apps don't interrupt and that your scanning security utilities are disabled--the EDR is internal, and no scanning of files is in any ways useful, but just slow things down stealing resources and processor cycles from Trainz--which will be pushing your processor to the limits!.

JA files are configured for rapid upload into the game and tightly organized. They may be ported version to version within certain limitations. TS09 JAs, TS10 JAs can be added to TS12's bag of tricks. TANE is expected to have similar capability, otherwise route and session assets that took many man-months to create would not be forward-compatible, a hallmark of Trainz since its earliest days.

/&gt;&amp;nbsp;or '''explicit parameter'''&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;A name in scripting encoding and decoding languages (such as wikimarkup language which builds this page) which has limited scope and which is a specific temporary keyword in passing a value to another process. Both the passing routine and the deciphering or called code must evaluate the term the same, and such parameters are case sensitive. The analog in general computing is a variable which must be declared of a specific type. In the scripting application, the typing is handled solely by context and interpretation, while in the compiled computer languages, the typing corresponds to allocation of physical memory and the typing also constrains the types of operations allowed on the data.{{anchor|pass parameter}}

Users are encouraged to add their own common terms to this page in a similar fashion. Please keep in mind that this site is dedicated to Trainz content creation, and terms which are meaningless in this context may be removed.

==General Train Terminology==

A note about general train terminology: even among nations where English is the official language, there are differences in terminology. For example, in England, the part of track known as a &quot;sleeper&quot; is called a &quot;tie&quot; in North America. An English railroader speaking of a &quot;bogey&quot;, and an North American railroader speaking of a &quot;truck&quot; are likely talking about the same thing. 


* In Advance Of - Signalling term. A signal is said to be 'in advance of' something, if a driver stopped at that signal would have to drive forwards to get there.
* In Rear Of - Signalling term. A signal is said to be 'in rear of' something, if a driver stopped at that signal would have to drive backwards to get there.

===Content Creation===

==== Aa to Bz====
&lt;big&gt;
* '''Alias''' - An asset which takes it's ''mesh'' from another asset, but replaces one or more of the original ''textures'' with locally provided ones. Commonly used to reskin an asset.
** &lt;code&gt;'''Note: Trainz 2009 (version 2.9) onwards do not accept aliased assets in Content Manager, though they still work in the game.'''&lt;/code&gt;
* '''{{TL|Alpha blending}}''' - The process of using an opacity setting or texture alpha channel to allow partial transparency. {{wp|Alpha blending}} is a hardware operation, however by itself blending does not combine well with a traditional hardware {{wp|depth-buffer}} technique.
** The end result is that multiple overlapping layers of alpha blending will not be rendered in the physically correct order without some alternative non-hardware-accelerated techniques. Such techniques should be avoided due to the associated performance losses.
** In short: use alpha blending sparingly, and do not apply an alpha-blended material to polygons which could do without.
* '''{{TL|Alpha masking}}''' - The process of using a texture alpha channel to &quot;mask out&quot; parts of the texture, allowing arbitrary see-through areas on the texture. Unlike ''alpha blending'', alpha masking does not allow semi-transparent areas - each resultant texel is either fully textured, or fully transparent. Alpha masking is a fully hardware-accelerated technique, and so acceptable.
* '''Asset''' - A single item of content in the Trainz environment, consisting of a ''config.txt file'' and any associated resource files.
** Sometimes, even frequently,... used (incorrectly) interchangeably with ''''content''''; technically, content is an asset included in a route or session&amp;mdash;until then an asset is an potential content item.
** Each asset is uniquely identified by its ''KUID''. An asset may reference any number of ''dependencies'' which are required for correct operation. 
* '''[http://www.blender.org Blender]''' - A free {{TC|Modeling}} tool with similar functionality to the commercial ''MAX'' software.
* '''{{TR|KD|KIND_Bogey|Bogey}}''' - Asset type used to represent wheels and suspension components. Used for anything that needs to rotate as the train moves along the track (e.g. wheels), or move (by rotation or translation) to match the angle and position of the track (e.g. subframe and suspension components). In the US this is normally referred to as a ''truck'', and in the UK as a ''bogie''.
* '''Bump mapping''' - Another term for ''Normal mapping''.
&lt;/big&gt;
====Ca to Md====
&lt;big&gt;
* '''Cab / Cabin / Interior''' - Asset made to represent the inside of an object, typically a ''Vehicle''.
* '''{{TA|Content Manager}}''' - Program for querying and editing the ''Trainz Asset Database''.
** Common tasks performed with Content Manager include downloading, uploading, installing, editing, archiving, error trapping (testing for, generation of) and removing content.
* '''Dependency''' - An ''asset'' which is required by this asset in order to function properly.
* '''Dependent''' - An ''asset'' which requires this asset in order to function properly.{{FAB-todo|This is unclear, dependent asset and dependencies are different CM drop down menu choices. Clarify!}}
* '''Geometry''' - A three-dimensional ''mesh'', without any related textures or material properties.
* '''{{wp|GMAX}}''' -A 3D modeling tool originally produced by Discreet for use in producing game assets. While still available, the software has not been in active development for some time, and is not considered to be a state of the art tool for Trainz asset creation. See also 3DSMax.
* '''Indices''' - Each triangle has three indices. Each index is a reference to a vertex. (Vertices can be shared between multiple polygons).
* '''{{TR|K|p=KUID}}''' - Unique identifier for a specific Trainz ''asset''. Consists of Creator ID, Content ID and Version number fields.
* '''{{N3V|Kuid-table_container|KUID Table}}''' - The {{N3V|Kuid-table_container|kuid-table container}} of an asset's {{TL|config.txt file}}. Used to specify ''dependencies''.
* {{wp|Level of detail|Level-Of-Detail}} (LOD)''' - A technique where an object (typically a mesh) is built with a number of variations which look as close as possible to identical, but which trade off quality as distance from the viewing point increases and that aids rendering performance to differing degrees. 
** The{{N3V|Auran_JET}} graphics engine selects between the various levels at runtime based on metrics such as distance from the observer. 
** For textures, ''mip-mapping'' serves a similar purpose without requiring manual attention.
** All medium-to-high-detail meshes should supply LOD variants. {{TA|LM.txt_file}}s are used for LOD on moving/animated models.
* '''{{N3V|Material_Types|Material}}''' - A named object with a specific material type in combination with its necessary parameters and ''textures''.
* '''MAX / {{wp|3D Studio Max}}''', or obsolescent {{wp|Gmax}} once bundled with early Trainz retail releases - The commercial {{TA|Modeling}} tool used and supported by Auran.
&lt;/big&gt;

====Me to Qz====
&lt;big&gt;
* '''{{wp|Polygon mesh|Mesh}}''' - A three-dimensional ''model'' used in the game environment. The word ''mesh'' is often used to refer to a specific game file containing the three-dimensional ''geometry'' without related properties such as the model's textures.
* '''Mesh Library''' - An asset which other assets use. These assets refer to the mesh library by KUID, using a 'mesh-asset' tag in their mesh table. Nothing special is needed for an asset to be a mesh library, it just has to contain mesh files.
* '''{{N3V|Mesh stitching}}''' - A runtime optimization process which combines multiple individual mesh instances into a single ''draw call'' for performance reasons. This results in higher performance with no visible changes.
* '''{{N3V|&quot;mesh-table&quot;_Container|Mesh Table}}''' - The {{TRC|mesh-table container}} of an asset's {{TL|config.txt file}}.
* '''{{TR|xL|Mip mapping}}''' - Process to reduce texture detail for objects in the distance, or at a sharp angle to the camera. Used to avoid problems with aliasing (flicker), which can occur where the texture is of comparable or higher detail than the display equipment.
* '''Model''' - A {{wp|three-dimensional}} definition of an {{wp|virtual reality|virtual}} 3D object, built in a special {{TC|modeling}} package such as Blender or Max. The word ''model'' is often used to describe the concept of a three-dimensional object including properties such as its textures.
* '''{{TC|Normal map|Normal mapping}}''' - A more advanced form of ''texture mapping'' which allows per-pixel control over the lighting conditions on the target geometry. Among other benefits, this technique allows a content creator to define small bumps and grooves in a surface in addition to simple coloration.
* '''Obsolete''' - An ''asset'' is obsolete if it has been replaced by a newer version with newer technology models and definitions, breaking the asset in part for a new {{TBS|trainz-build|trainz-build tag}} value (version).
** A container type or tag in a {{TR|K|p=KIND}} is obsolete because the programmers say so&amp;mdash;because they have a real need to change the {{wp|data structure}} in a new Trainz advance, ''normally without warning the user community first.''
* '''{{TBS|string-table container|String Table}}''' - The {{TBS|string-table container}} of an asset's {{TL|config.txt file}}. Used for localization strings (i.e. anything that will be displayed to the user).
* '''Pixel''' - One individual point on a ''texture'' image, consisting of red, green, blue and alpha components (e.g. a texture size of 512 pixels by 512 pixels). May also refer to one individual point within a display (e.g. a display size of 1024 pixels by 768 pixels).
* '''Polygons''' - In modeling terms, a polygon is always a triangle. (Please note, this is different from the 3DSMax definition).
&lt;/big&gt;

====Ra to Tq====
&lt;big&gt;
* '''Render call''' / '''Draw call''' - A single hardware rendering operation. This is an important concept when performance is a concern, as there is a substantial performance overhead to each draw call. By minimizing the number of draw calls, the same scene can be rendered at a notably higher frame rate. Each draw call associates one ''material'' with some quantity of ''vertices'' and ''indices''. 
* {{TR|K|KIND_Map|Route / Layout / Map}} - Asset created in ''Surveyor'', consisting of a textured landscape and one or more ''Layers'' containing ''scenery objects'', ''splines'', ''trackside objects'', ''Vehicles'', etc.
* '''{{TR|K|KIND_Scenery|Scenery}}''' / '''Map object'''  - A scenery object is an instance of an ''asset'' that is placed in Surveyor at a given location and orientation. 
* '''{{TR|K|KIND_Profile|Session}}''' - Asset created in surveyor, which extends a ''map'' by placing on it additional layers of objects - commonly ''Vehicles'', but any ''scenery object'', ''spline'', ''trackside object'', etc, can also be added. The Session also contains all the saved script data from any asset in the combination of map and session.
* '''Specular lighting''' - Lighting effects that vary dependent on the angle of incident light.
* '''{{TR|K|KIND_Track|Spline}}''' - A continuous linear 3D model such as a hedge, a fence, a road, or a track. Splines are placed in Surveyor as a series of ''spline control points'' and the geometry is built in a smoothed path between the control points.
* '''Texel''' - One texture pixel, once mapped onto a 3D Model and rendered in a scene. Does not correspond to one screen pixel.
* '''Texture''' - A two-dimensional image used for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping texture mapping].
* '''Texture Sharing''' - When two or more ''{{wp|Polygon mesh|meshes}}'' in the same asset (which may be a ''mesh library'', and thus used by many assets) use the same ''material'' and ''texture''. Trainz can then use ''mesh stitching'' to render them in the same ''draw call'', with corresponding performance improvements.
&lt;/big&gt;
====Tr to Zz====
&lt;big&gt;
* '''{{TR|K|KIND_Scenery-trackside|Trackside object}}''' - A trackside object is a specialisation of a ''{{TC|scenery object}}'' that is placed attached to a spline. When the spline is moved, the trackside object is also moved.
* '''{{TC|Scripting|TrainzScript}}''' / {{TC|Scripting|GameScript}} - Used interchangeably, these terms refer to the Trainz scripting language.
* '''Trainz Asset Database''' - Contains all the metadata information about Trainz content. Editable through{{TL|Content_Manager}} and {{TL|TrainzUtil}}.
* '''TrainzUtil''' - Command line tool to query and edit the ''Trainz Asset Database''.
* '''Trainz Native Interface''' - TBD
* '''Triangles''' - Three vertices (or specifically, three indices) form a triangle. The triangle is the basic unit of a ''mesh'' ''geometry''.
* '''{{TR|KD|KIND_Traincar|Vehicle}}''' - All ''assets'' which can be placed into a train (consist). Includes locomotives. Not to be confused with road cars, which are actually ''Trackside'' objects (as they are attached to roads).
* '''Vertices''' - The individual three-dimensional (x, y, z) coordinates that form the corner points of ''triangles'' in a ''mesh'' ''geometry''.

There are many reasons to send e-mails from a web app, e.g., to receive user feedback or usage data of the web app. Unfortunately, JavaScript does not directly support sending e-mails. 

One solution is to use a PHP script (on a web server that supports PHP) and let that PHP script send the e-mail since PHP does support sending e-mails. In this case, all the web app has to do is to send the data to the PHP script. 

Here is an example for a simple PHP script that sends an e-mail to a hard-coded e-mail address with a hard-coded subject line. The script puts the raw data (in plain text format) that has been &quot;post&quot;ed to it into the body of the e-mail:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  if (isset($HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA)) {
    mail(&quot;my.email@example.com&quot;,
      &quot;my subject&quot;,
      filter_var($HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA, FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING),
      &quot;From: my.email@example.com\n&quot;);
  }
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
Of course, you should replace the e-mail address by your e-mail address to receive the e-mails. Note that this e-mail address will be publicly visible; thus, you should use an e-mail address that you are willing to abandon in case it is abused.

The name of the PHP script should have the extension &quot;.php&quot; such that the web server can identify it as a PHP script. If you don't have access to a web server that supports PHP, you might know someone who does and is willing to host your script (at the risk that it significantly increases network traffic).

The script itself checks whether any raw data (in plain text format) has been posted to it (see below for how this is done in JavaScript). If so, it sends an e-mail with the sanitized raw data. Sanitizing is necessary to avoid abuse of the script by others. The maximum size of the raw data depends on the configuration of the web server; typically it's more than a megabyte.

In the JavaScript code of the web app, you can then send some data (here the string &lt;code&gt;&quot;my\r\ndata\r\n&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) through the PHP script (here it is assumed to be at &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;http://example.com/url/of/php/script/emailme.php&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;):
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
    var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
    httpRequest.open(&quot;post&quot;, &quot;http://example.com/url/of/php/script/emailme.php&quot;, true);
    httpRequest.setRequestHeader(&quot;Content-Type&quot;, &quot;text/plain&quot;);
    httpRequest.send(&quot;my\r\ndata\r\n&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;
Of course, you should replace the URL of the PHP script to wherever your script is located and you should replace the data that is sent by any string you want to send. (Note the recommended line breaks with a return and a newline character: &lt;code&gt;&quot;\r\n&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.)


For more information about different ways of using &lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/code&gt; in JavaScript, see [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest#Submitting_forms_and_uploading_files Using XMLHttpRequest] in the Mozilla Developer Network.

==Trainz Mice Click!==
This page is dedicated to all the new Trainzers, and to those who haven't been around for a while because the software takes a lot of learning. Here we link a page with a brief on how the mouse is used in various Trainz modules. In most cases, the use is quite instinctive, but this page gives us a way to just begin loading data into your learning curves without explaining on everypage what this stuff means.

===Mouse use notations===

# {{kp|LMB}} - Left Mouse Button, click
## In {{TL|Driver}}, will attach your external camera to a traincar, even in another {{TG|C|consist}}&lt;!--; possibly some other {{TL|Cab Mode}} actions in later developed content--&gt;. Also operates the button controls in Driver, just like Windows clickings, switch junctions using click toggle action, or (when in exernal or free camera mode) toggle/operate ''button organized controls'' like couple and decouple this or that hitch between cars.
## In {{TL|Surveyor}}, attaches (puts down something) using the active selected tool or {{TG|S|scenery object}} adder tool to the world mesh ''if in add mode''; gets asset in the various ''get'' (identify or select the same asset) ''tools'', and generally puts things down like scenery objects (buildings, bushes, animals, trees), spline objects (stretchy track, fences, telephone wires) or'' 'selects' them in some way (move this there, get that same thingy), including tools and tool panel controls.
## In {{TL|Railyard}}, controls the click driven viewing menu modes.
# {{kp|LMBH}} - Left Mouse Button, Hold
## In Driver is used to select control in Cab Mode preparatory to dragging adjustment (e.g. throttles, air brake levers, Horn or steam engine whistle, etc.)
## In surveyor is used to select vertexes or assets preparatory to dragging ({{kp|LMBHd}}) including changing surface elevations in the terrain up/down tool. [mode and tool dependent]
# {{kp|LMBHd}} - Left Mouse Button, Hold and drag 
## In surveyor and driver is used to select and move things.
## In driver is used to select and move control levers, rotate valves or the DCC mode 'virtual dial control'.    
# {{kp|RMB}} - Right Mouse Button, click
# {{kp|RMBH}} - Right Mouse Button, Hold 
# {{kp|RMBHd}} - Right Mouse Button, Hold and drag 
## In CM/CMP accesses a drop down menu, in which case you also need to drag, then release on the selection desired.
## In Surveyor and Driver - {{kp|RMBHd}} is how we move (slide or fly) around. In Surveyor (and Driver's external camera view, or free camera {{kp|4}} mode) it causes the camera position and your relative movement to operate as described in the below Tip-box, enabling us to get around in the virtual worlds of Trainz.

==Moving in Trainz==
{{TrainzTip|1=Surveyor Options menu, allows two map mode or movement controls to be modified to the users preferences. The default mode when the game first boots to operate ''many find confusing'' because the mouse controls camera position sliding, altitude, and rotation all in one, when and if panning. We recommend this combination initially for the best easiest operations: (New users have enough to get used to without the disorientation the default controls can give.) 
* Camera behavior - '''Rotation''' not Panning (default)
* Compass Movement - '''Mouse''' or Keyboard
These options are accessible  in the &lt;code&gt;Main Menu &gt; Surveyor Options&lt;/code&gt; and affect behavior in both Driver and Surveyor operations. 
* Movement around in Trainz will then become instinctive and intuitive, use the {{kp|←}} and {{kp|→}} arrow keys to rotate, the {{kp|↑}} and {{kp|↓}} keys to tilt the view, roll the {{kp|thumbwheel}} to zoom in or out. 
* The camera is offset from the screen center at all times by the combination of the {{kp|↑}} and {{kp|↓}} setting and zoom, focused away from the center aiming circle. Tilting the camera angle down, causes the camera viewpoint to rise above it's location, allowing look down viewing at most any angle. When moving tilted down, some of us call it '''''flying the route''''', for it's free as a bird with the similar viewpoint.
* Rotate relative to North-South as noted above, thereafter {{kp|RMBH}} and move the mouse away from the center aiming point will cause the camera viewpoint to slide ''proportional to the distance the mouse tip deviates from center''. It will move rapidly if you press the button farther away, so can cover ground quickly, slower if you keep it held down closer to on target. 
:* You'll also quickly learn (''to the point it becomes unconscious and instinctive'') to position the mouse tip near center screed before clicking the {{kp|LMB}} when in rhe free camera modes. That is the only mode inside Surveyor. Driver has four camera modes: In Cab, external on the consist (attached to any one car), fixed or Tracking cameras (if and when some are pre-placed by route builders), and free camera mode (you can fly or walk the ground).
:* With the wrong choice of angle and in some terrain you can teleport a mile or so in one click, so don't click on far away hills unless you want to go there!
* A single click {{kp|RMB}} off center will jump the locus to the new point off to the side in the current ({{TG|P|panorama}}) view). Rotation relative to the cartesian world (N-S) axis is fixed unless you use the arrow keys to change it.
:* This jump mode is similar in the minimap as well, on which sliding does not work. That is accessed pressing {{kp|CTRL|M}} (or just {{kp|M}} in Driver, where {{kp|CTRL|M}} also works. Click on a locus away from the aiming target/center and hop around the map in the same orientation North=to=South.
:* Roll the mouse wheel in the minimap to zoom in or expand your view outwards (so the map shows more terrain, but less detail.) It'll take only a few minutes and only a few trys to master.

{{Trainz-admin}}

==Purpose==
{{TRS-cleanup|Readers should be warned this schema has become altered based on the hard facts of needs. As it currently stands, [[Trainz/Project]] and [[Trainz/Templates]] are also out of date pending new debugging and use results as older pages are revised, and new pages created, giving confidence we can set the scheme, at which time we can spare time and attentions to reconfirm instructional pages on how to write for the Wikibook. In the meanwhile, ask!. [[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 21:05, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
}}
This associated index page is a master '''&lt;u&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/u&gt;''' page for reference material relocated into '''[[Trainz references|Trainz Wikibook Appendicyclopdeia pages]]''' whilst overhauling the dated [[Trainz]] 'beast', which was begun systematically in March 2014. Other Volumes are being created with materials on content and operations and split into other volumes...
: {{bull}} [[Trainz/AM&amp;C]] (Trainz Asset Management and Creation (TA),
: {{bull}} [[Trainz/Content Creation]] (TC)
: {{bull}} [[Trainz]] which will be slanted to introductory Trainz and General Trainz knowledge topics, whereas the Trainz AM&amp;C deals with Tyro class, Introductory class, or slightly advanced topics such as {{TA|Fixing Assets}}. TC intermediate and advanced Content Creation information and tutorials whilst TR are select excerpts of the uncopyrighted TrainzWiki so under the thumb of the N3V programmers. Unlike that source material, the version here is expected to contain ample examples, explanatory prose, including historical older forms and formats and other such materials which aid understanding, ease learning curves and speed mastery of the many topics in Trainz.

There are currently three glossaries to aid understanding of topics in this [[Trainz]] Book Volume

*{{TL|Glossary}}
*{{TR|x|Notations}} 
*[[Trainz references/Steam locomotive components|Steam locomotive components]] and a template suite developed in the last few weeks to ease writing and linking Trainz Topics. See {{Tlx|TL}}, {{Tl|TA}}, {{Tl|TC}}, {{Tl|TG}}, {{Tl|TR}}, {{TL|Admin}} and {{TL|Templates}} for starters if you wish to assist in writing understandable aids to other less experienced Trainzers. Three are also templates to license images put on the Mediawiki.commons, and others to consistently categorize pages of these volumes. 

===Organization and conventions===
;for contributors, these conventions
* Excepting quotes around tag or container names in the N3V developers wiki, use the same case and titles as used therein, but for tags, add the word 'tag' (singular -- See mode table at bottom of {{Tl|TR}}) if the page does not have such suffixes.
** This references has sister-levels, Kinds, containers, tags, and references (as a catch-all group. The later will hold more generalized formats, data references, config.txt files, etc. discussions. the first three specialize to the types as indicated.

* Make sure to enter the source page in {{Tlx|ORP-bot|src=http...}} for proper C-C-by-S-A licensing notice and cross linking. Multiple word titles as in a url should contain underscores NEVER spaces between words, or links won't work. (See {{Tl|Plain link}} or {{tl|N3V}} for more on that.)
* Always remember the mission is to present clear how to, unlike the N3V wiki, so write and explain, elaborate as necessary to assist newbie and intermediate Trainzers gain understanding and mastery.

Place full up example pages in a 'title-related' sub-page with a title {{TR|K|KIND Traincar|KIND Traincar example of Passenger Car}} or {{tlx|TR|KD|KIND Traincar|p=Example_of_Diesel-Electric_Locomotive}} for example data types like {{TR|K|KIND}}s are sub-pages of the 'Kinds' page&amp;mdash; a division of this page. So too should you properly place an example of various examples of {{TR|K|KIND Traincar}}s while indenting in the TOC table to show the parent-child relationship. 
----
;note these links above formed as
&lt;pre&gt;
{{TR|KD|KIND Traincar|KIND Traincar example of Passenger Car}}
{{TR|KD|KIND Traincar|KIND Traincar example of Diesel-Electric Locomotive}}
{{TR|KD|KIND}}s
{{TR|KD|KIND Traincar}}s

&lt;!--* Do install such examples as as a sub-sub-page under the sub-page [[Trainz/Kinds/KIND Traincar]] such as [[Trainz/Kinds/KIND Traincar/Kind Traincar example of Diesel-Electric Locomotive]] as is the nominal standard in the wiki.

'''KIND Traincar''', provides the self-definition basis for all individual train Vehicles in their {{TR|R|config.txt file}}s. For example, a single item of {{TG|R|rollingstock}}, such as a steam Locomotive tender, coal hopper, or passenger cars each begin their self-definition with inclusion and proper definition of the specified ''requisite data types'' enumerated in '''KIND Traincar'''.

This asset type inherits all trackside positioning and mesh display characteristics from the parent class {{TR|KD|KIND Scenery-trackside}}, and adds vehicle-specific functions such as traincar physics and control mechanisms.

==KIND Hierarchy==
===Parent Classes===
* {{TR|KD|KIND Scenery-trackside}}
This parent may seem surprising to the new Trainzer, but keep in mind the data model classifications such as the {{TBS}}, tags, {{TR|K}}s and {{TA|containers}}
===Child Classes===
* ''none.''

==Tags Table==
Each traincar asset supports the following tags. Each tag is shown here with its default value.

==Supported Tags==
These are individual tags and their meanings.

====bogeys====
:Type: container
:Desc: Specifies what bogies are attached where, and with what modifiers. Documented separately {{TR|cd|bogeys container}}.

====cabin_muffle====
:Type: Decimal
:Desc: Amount that the enginesound volume should be reduced to when in-cab. Default of 0.4 is 40% volume, intended to represent a fully enclosed and noise deadened cab. Note: Steam locos have a different default. They default to 1.0 - no muffling at all. (Steam loco cabs are very frequently not fully enclosed, let alone fitted with noise deadening material.)
====cabinsway====
:Type: Decimal
:Desc: Controls the amount of 'sway' the interior view has as the vehicle takes corners. A bigger number will result in more sway.

====company====
:Type: English Text String
:Desc: Text string to indicate which railway company or organisation this vehicle is in service with as represented.

====disable-extra-track-sounds====
:Type: Boolean
:Desc: Disables extra track sounds for this vehicle. Useful for making drivable ships, aircraft, road vehicles, etc. - anything that should not make wheel-on-rail type sounds.

====ditch_color====
:Type: Color(RGB)
:Desc: Color of ditch lights (values are integer between 0 and 255, comma separated for red, green, and blue).

====engine====
:Type: Boolean
:Desc: If 1, vehicle is a locomotive, if 0, vehicle is an unpowered traincar. Locomotives are expected to have cab interiors, hornsounds, enginesounds, and so on.

====enginesound====
:Type: KUID
:Desc: {{TR2|KD|KIND Enginesound|Enginesound Asset}} to use with this locomotive.

====enginespec====
:Type: KUID
:Desc: {{TR|KD|KIND Engine|Enginespec Asset (KIND Engine)}} to use with this locomotive. Defines locomotive performance characteristics.

====flash_scale====
:Type: Decimal
:Desc: Sets the speed that the ditch lights flash at.

====fonts====
:Type: Integer
:Desc: Number of running-number fonts to use on this locomotive.

====fonts-path====
:Type: Text
:Desc: Asset name to use when determining where running numbers are stored. This will be concatenated with &quot;_alpha_numbers&quot; to work out the path to the images to be used for the running numbers.  For example if the supplied name is &quot;my_loco&quot; then the path, from the asset folder, will be &quot;my_loco_alpha_numbers&quot;.

====high_beam_value====
:Type: Decimal array
:Desc: Comma separated sequence of decimal values - used to configure the brightness of the lights when in high beam mode. First number applies to first headlight point, and so on. Values are divisors - e.g. a value of 2 means half brightness.

====hornsound====
:Type: KUID
:Desc: {{TR2|KD|KIND Hornsound|Hornsound Asset}} to play when locos horn is blown.

====light_color====
:Type: Color(RGB)
:Desc: Color of headlight (values are integer between 0 and 255, comma separated for red, green, and blue).

====low_beam_value====
:Type: Decimal array
:Desc: Comma separated sequence of decimal values - used to configure the brightness of the lights when in low beam mode. First number applies to first headlight point, and so on. Values are divisors - e.g. a value of 2 means half brightness.

====mass====
:Type: Decimal
:Desc: Mass of the vehicle in Kilograms when empty - i.e. the tare weight, not the gross weight. The mass of any products loaded into queues will be added to this by the game.

====max-coupler-gap====
:Type: decimal
:Desc: Specifies the amount of permissible coupler slack on this vehicle in Metres. Note: The observable slack between any two vehicles will be the average of the values for each vehicle. Cannot be zero.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Consider some limit

&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} &lt;/math&gt;

which cannot be evaluated directly, that is, either f(a) = g(a) = 0 or

&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\to a} g(x) = \lim_{x\to a} g(x) =  \infty&lt;/math&gt;

L'Hopital's rule says that 

&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} &lt;/math&gt;

Suppose both are equal to zero. The Newton definition of the derivative is

&lt;math&gt; f'(a) = \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

&lt;math&gt; \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)} =  \lim_{x\to a} \frac{\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a}}{\frac{g(x) - g(a)}{x-a}} = \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{g(x) - g(a)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)} = \frac{f(a)}{g(a)} = \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}&lt;/math&gt;

Now suppose that both &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; g&lt;/math&gt; diverge to positive or negative infinity. Another way to define the derivative is by

&lt;math&gt; f'(a) = \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{f(x+a)}{x} &lt;/math&gt;

Then

&lt;math&gt; \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}  = \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{xf(x+a)}{xg(x+a)} = \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{f(x+a)}{g(x+a)} = \frac{f(x+a)}{g(x+a)} &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cell Fractionation==

===Purpose===
Cell Fractionation is a standard procedure used to separate subcellular organelles based on how cells differentially separate in a centrifuge. Organelles separate in a centrifuge based on density, shape, and size. The nuclues is typically the first organelle to become pelleted in a centrifuge. 

The central piece of equipment in cell fractionation is a centrifuge. A centrifuge is a piece of equipment that spins rapidly and thus adds a centripetal force on the object that is spinning. All particles in the centrifuge will feel the same force being applied, but those that are more dense will move much faster through the liquid and sediment with less force than particles that have lower densities.

The centrifugal (or centripetal) acceleration is usually expressed as multiples of the acceleration of gravity. For example, if the centrifuge is exerting the same force that gravity would exert, then it is expressed as 1 G. If it's exerting a force 10 times stronger than gravity, then it is expressed as 10 G. The relative centripetal acceleration (commonly called the Relative Centrifugal Force)can be calculated using the formula 
RCF= (r X RPM&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; X (2π)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; * (100/36))/(1000&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; X g)
Where:
*r = the radius in centimeters of the sample from the center of the centrifuge
*RPM = Revolutions Per Minute
*g = gravitational constant (9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
This equation is usually reduced to RCF = 11.19 X r X (RPM/1000)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

If your centrifuge will not obtain the specified RCF, then you may be able to compensate by centrifuging for a longer time. For example, if a procedure calls for centrifuging with an RCF of 10,000G for 60 seconds, but your centrifuge can only obtain 9,000 G, you may be able to compensate for this by centrifuging for 67 seconds.
The equation to determine the compensation time required is:
t&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = (t&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; X RCF&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;)/RCF&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;
Where:
*t&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = the time required in your centrifuge
*t&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = the time specified in the instructions
*RCF&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = The RCF specified in the instructions
*RCF&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = The maximum RCF your centrifuge can obtain

Differential Sedimentation:
:Separation of cellular organelles is possible because particles tend to sediment at different rates. There are several factors that determine the sedimentation rate. 
* Density: All other things equal, the more dense a particle is, the faster it will sediment. However if a particle is the same density as the liquid in the sample, then it will not sediment at all. If, however, the particle is less dense than the liquid medium (as is the case with oils and lipids when placed in water), it will move to the top of the medium. 
* Size: All other things equal, the larger a particle is, the faster it will sediment. If two rocks of different size, but the same density are dropped off of a boat, the larger rock will tend to sink faster. This is because there is more mass (assuming density is equal) on which gravity can act. The larger mass can more easily overcome the friction of the water and sink faster. This does not mean that gravity acts differently on different masses. It is simply another way of describing the action of the medium that it is passing through. A single feather will fall slower than a bag of feathers. However, in a vacuum, they would fall at the same speed. 
* Viscosity: The viscosity (or thickness) of the liquid medium can slow the rate of sedimentation. If two particles are relatively close in size and density and only have small differences, it may be possible to separate them from each other by increasing the viscosity of the liquid medium. 

This procedure allows isolation of the cell nuclues, mitochondria, and cell membrane.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Not sure how to edit the title of the page and link it properly. I tried following the format that I had seen on another section, but it ended up looking much different.

I need some help! I don't know how to set up equations. If someone could explain to me how to do it, then I would appreciate it.
Also, I know I put a lot of stuff in this article about centrifugation. Perhaps it should be moved into the &quot;basic&quot; section of this book. IDK, any thoughts are appreciated

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; &amp; 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century western imperialism was not the first example of the attempt by powerful nations to completely subjugate the peoples of a variety of ethnicities, nationalities and cultures.  Numerous civilizations dating back to and even before ancient Mesopotamia sought territorial expansion and the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples.  However, beginning in the mid-19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, a combination of factors led western Europe, the United States and Japan to engage in global territorial conquest on a scale never before seen.  Competition for territories in Africa, Asia, the Pacific Rim region and, to a much lesser extent, South America brought about as complete a domination of the globe's resources and peoples such that the ancient Greeks, Romans and Mongols could only have dreamed of, let alone achieved.  The examination of this era of &quot;New Imperialism&quot; requires consideration of not only the causes and effects of western empire building.  It also requires an examination of the responses by the various peoples from around the world who saw their land, their culture and their society completely altered by the demands of their new imperial overlords.

Britain Conquers India

India and China were key trading destinations for Europeans for centuries prior to the mid-19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Spices, opium, indigo and, tea were high-priced, highly-prized trading commodities for the British, Dutch, French and Portuguese, all of whom established trading posts in both countries during the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries.  However, by the mid-18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, Britain broke away from the &quot;pack&quot; and established hegemony over large swaths of India as the result of several European wars whose reach extended to the Indian sub-continent.

&lt;!--{{TOCright}}--&gt;
The '''ACS Text Format''' is an Auran-defined international languages supporting text format used for storing {{TR|R|config.txt file}}s and other generic key/value data. At the simplest level, an ACS Text file is a standard text file encoded in {{wp|UTF-8 |UTF-8}}. It is typically recommended that an ACS Text file start with a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark Unicode BOM sequence] (Byte Order Mark), however that is not strictly required, but will be noticeable in many config.txt files as a invisible code occupying the first line of the file.

==Basic File Structure==
;In programmer jargon
ACS Text files contain an ''unordered list of '''key-value''' pairs''. In any given processing scope, each key '''must''' be unique. A key-value pair can be declared in {{plain link|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form|Extended Backus&amp;mdash;Naur Form}} (EBNF) ({{wp|Metasyntax}} forming a context-free grammer) as follows:

 &lt;singlespace&gt; ::= ' ' | &lt;TAB&gt; ;
 &lt;whitespace&gt; ::= &lt;singlespace&gt; | { &lt;singlespace&gt; } ;
 &lt;line-start&gt; ::= { &lt;whitespace&gt; | &lt;EOL&gt; } ;
 &lt;key-value-pair&gt; ::= &lt;line-start&gt; &lt;key&gt; &lt;whitespace&gt; &lt;value&gt; &lt;EOL&gt; ;
 &lt;acs-text-file&gt; ::= [ &lt;unicode-bom&gt; ] { &lt;key-value-pair&gt; } &lt;line-start&gt; ;

It is important to note that the &lt;value&gt; may span multiple lines in some cases.
* (I've been programming since 1976, and ''even my eyes glaze over reading and trying to understand that''... so we write for you here in the Wikibook!)

;In layperson terms
Auran/N3V have set up a system of data structures where there are pairs and values, and some values are complex types which can include other simple and complex types.
{{TextBox|These later are called {{wp|data structure}}s like {{wp|struct}}s, {{wp|union type|unions}}, or {{wp|array}}s in many languages&amp;mdash;especially {{wp|The C Programming Language|C-language}} derived {{wp|computer language}}s and are generally just lumped together as '{{TA|containers}}' in Trainz. When you see a container containing a container you are dealing with a structure part of which is another structure type, such as arrays (e.g. passenger lists product types) or bogeys (trucks, which specify wheels, X,y,z factors of mount points, type of mounting, etc., but all data which is related to the other factors so ''''''is grouped together'''''' since it is used together and that's the way we humans think of it best too.)
}}
==Permitted Keyname characters==
{{leftBox|1=
: 'This section refers to the creation of keynames, or tags in Trainz. The average user has nothing to do with such, but a Content Creator, particularly script writer's can, do, and likely will.''
* Nonetheless, the prohibitions also extend to filenames, so making a {{TBS|username}} violating this standard is likely to fail on validation. But go ahead, if you like Faults messages!}}
A '''key''' ('''key name''') is a sequence of unicode characters with a maximum size of 511 bytes. Control characters ({{wp|ASCII}} 0..31) and the space character (ASCII 32) are not permitted. Uppercase ASCII characters (ASCII 64..89) are not permitted. The open-brace character (ASCII 123) is not permitted as the first character of a key. The close-brace character (ASCII 125) is not permitted.

For future compatibility, it is strongly recommended that implementations limit keys to the following set of characters when constructing an config.txt compliant with ''this '''ACS Text file standard'''''. Implementations '''must'' accept all valid characters when parsing an ACS Text file.
&lt;tt&gt;
* 'a' .. 'z'
* '0' .. '9'
* '-'
* '/'
* '_'&lt;/tt&gt;
{{TextBox|Note these key omissions: &lt;tt&gt;'\', ':', ';', '`', '~',, '@', '*', '#', '$', '%', '^', '&amp;', '{', '[', ')', ']'&lt;/tt&gt;
}}

==Values==

Each value may include zero or more UTF-8 characters. Several types of value are available with unique encodings. Value types are automatically identified based on the {{TR|T}} and/or contents of the value, no type information is written into the file. 

 &lt;value&gt; ::= &lt;null-value&gt; | &lt;numeric-value&gt; | &lt;numeric-array-value&gt; | &lt;string-value&gt; | &lt;kuid-value&gt; | &lt;container-value&gt; ;

{{TRS-warning|xBG=yellow|Excepting multiline unprocessed text block tags such as {{TBS|description}} and {{TBS|license}}, any value laden string value '''''may not''''' contain a trailing {{wp|whitespace}} character. &lt;hr&gt;Such will produce both an warning and an Fault message such as:

Error: No selection for tag 'category-region' in 'mocrossing'.
Warning: 'US ' is not a valid value for tag 'category-region'.  This tag is now empty and a new value must be selected.
}}

==Null Value==

A null value is literally a zero-length value.

 &lt;null-value&gt; ::= [ &lt;whitespace&gt; ] ;

===Numeric Values===

A numeric value is an integer or decimal representation.

 &lt;number&gt; ::= [ &quot;-&quot; ] &lt;digit&gt; { &lt;digit&gt; } [ &quot;.&quot; &lt;digit&gt; { &lt;digit&gt; } ] ;
 &lt;numeric-value&gt; ::= &lt;number&gt; [ &lt;whitespace&gt; ] ;

===Numeric Array Values===

A numeric array value is a sequence of multiple numbers, separated by commas.

 &lt;array-separator&gt; ::= [ &lt;whitespace&gt; ] &quot;,&quot; [ &lt;whitespace&gt; ] ;
 &lt;numeric-array-value&gt; ::= &lt;number&gt; &lt;array-separator&gt; { &lt;number&gt; &lt;array-separator&gt; } &lt;number&gt; [ &lt;whitespace&gt; ] ;

===String Values===

A string value is a sequence of zero or more UTF-8 characters, surrounded by quotation marks (ASCII 34.) The use of the double quote character (ASCII 34) and the backslash character (ASCII 92) ''are proscribed''. Strings may continue over multiple lines and may include whitespace (including the newline or CR-LF ASCII EOL sequence). The delimiting value is the enclosing quote marks.

 &lt;string-value&gt; ::= &lt;double-quote&gt; { &lt;string-character&gt; } &lt;double-quote&gt; [ &lt;whitespace&gt; ] ;

==KUID Values==

A KUID value is a single KUID in a {{TL|KUIDs|kuid valid format}}.

 &lt;kuid-value&gt; ::= &lt;KUID&gt; [ &lt;whitespace&gt; ] ;

===Container Values===

A container value nests additional key-value pairs over multiple lines.

 &lt;container-value&gt; ::= [ &lt;EOL&gt; ] &quot;{&quot; &lt;EOL&gt; { &lt;key-value-pair&gt; } &lt;line-start&gt; &quot;}&quot; ;

==Key Ordering==

The 'ACS Text Format' is technically an unordered key-value soup, however all existing implementations are order-preserving for trivial (read, write) operations. It is recommended that future implementations maintain this convention.

==Format Violations==

The effect of a format violation detected during parsing is undefined. An implementation which follows this specification must not generate a file which violates any aspect of this specification.

I'm a biology major recently accepted to Medical School.

I just discovered Wikibooks and would like to donate some time and energy into improving biology texts. 

Like I said, I'm new and wikibooks is not at all intuitive. There will be a learning curve, but grace is appreciated</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;This template does nothing.

More exactly, it outputs the [[w:null string|null string]]. It's useful for programming advanced templates.

*It often is used within a template to the right of an equals sign. 
*It can be''very useful'' in (usually temporary pending a revision, or to troubleshoot template behavior) killing part of template or page containing text and (''especially multiple'') html comments (&amp;lt;!--- some commented stuff ---&amp;gt;) surrounding the combined strings and multiple lines inside the template, which feeds them ... nowhere. Into the mythological bit bucket. 

==Alternatives==
It's also possible to use &lt;code&gt;{{x|ns|ns:0}}&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{void}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

Some [[mw:Magic words|magic words]] like {{x|END}} might also have the desired effect of doing nothing.

|start

|smoke# {

|The usage of stard depends on the value of the mode tag. If the mode is set to time, start is a set of time values in seconds after the creation of this effect’s parent object when this phase of the effect will start. If the mode is set to speed, start is a speed in meters per second (m/s) and period is not used. (Note: 1 m/s = 3.6 km/hr.) All other sequence attributes (rate, velocity, lifetime, minsize, maxsize) are interpolated so there are smooth transitions between phases. If the mode is set to anim, start is a value from 0.0 to 1.0 which describes the start time into the object’s animation cycle. If the mode is set to timeofday, start is a value from 0.0 to 1.0 which describes the time of day when this effect will start. Values range as follow: 0 - midnight, 0.25 - 6am, 0.5 - midday, 0.75 6pm, 1.0 - midnight.

==Introduction to the KIND Hierarchy==

'''KIND TrainzBaseSpec''' provides the basis definitions for all Trainz asset types in all {{TR|R|config.txt}} {{wp|ini file}}s. The '''TBS''' provides for a number of &quot;Standard Tags&quot; which are common to (''or at least, can legally be defined'') for any and ''all Trainz assets''&lt;ref name=&quot;N3V-TBS&quot;&gt;N3V's {{Plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/KIND_TrainzBaseSpec|KIND_TrainzBaseSpec}},as unaugmented  source page lacking historical information (tags) found here; accessdate=Summer 2014&lt;/ref&gt;. 
* Some of these are mandatory, for they determine the further processing of the asset and the interpretation of the config.txt file and the assets data in its folder.
* However most are optional and a defining line using the tag may be omitted in most sub-assets.

==Parent Classes==
* None. KIND TrainzBaseSpec is a '''root class''' from which other Trainz Asset classes are derived. They are said to be derived because they inherit processing attributes and values defined by the parameters listed herein, and the asset's {{TR|K|p=kind declarations}}.

==Child Classes==
&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;
&lt;!--- ******** NOTE you may now be on a different page than Trainz references\Kinds ******

==Kinds of KINDs==

;To edit source page material {{edit|:Trainz/references/TrainzBaseSpec#Kinds_of_KINDs
|edit Table}}
---&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/includeonly&gt;
All the below Child Classes are considered to have the {{TBS}} as their Parent Class of data.{{efn| {{TTip|pre=Note|This list is 'wikified' on the N3V TrainzOnline Wiki, meaning the first letter has been capitalized after the word 'KIND', whereas actual data tag names in config.txt files are &lt;u&gt;all lower case&lt;/u&gt; text. That wiki also uses double quotes in quite a few terms, a practice which we'll spare you from experiencing herein.}}}}

==Table I, TBS definitions==
Tags are keys, and have a single assigned key-value or string-array
Containers are collections of key and key-value pairs and upper-level containers (as opposed to sub-containers such as those within the thumbnails container) are generally suffixed by '-table'.

==Supported Tags==
The {{TR|Kinds|KIND TrainzBaseSpec}} supports the following tags in a {{TA|config.txt file}}. {{FAB-todo|Did I ... Each tag is show here with its ''default value''}}:
&amp;nbsp;

===kind tag===
:''type:'' string.
:''field definition:'' The asset type which this {{TL|config.txt file}} represents. See the list: {{TR|Kinds|KIND_TrainzBaseSpec#Table_of_KIND_Child_Classes|here (above)}}
{{anchor|kuid|Kuid|Kuid tag|Kuid Tag}}
&amp;nbsp;
===kuid tag===
:''type:'' {{TG|K|KUID}} (brief), ''Main: {{TL|KUIDs}}''
:''field definition:'' The unique asset ID referencing this asset.

;KUID
:'' 'Koolthingz Unique IDentifier'.'' A unique database reference number for an asset, extended to track multiple versions in the KUID2 form. The heart and soul of Trainz upgradability, and modular design of assets, as each asset has it's own unique kuid code, so one can specify a component (bogeys) or entire Traincar from another, and selectively replace either in a new asset (re-skin or modified truck).
* '''Most Trainz assets specify a list of dependencies in their {{TBS|kuid-table}}&amp;mdash;other component assets which are assembled by the various parts of the software suite to make up a renderable and useable asset in a {{TR|con|kuid-table}}. 
* Within the heart of many assets, specific tags may be defined by '''''kuid reference''' and use the referenced asset as a part.'' This is in fact how reskinning is implemented, and it is possible to also use a mesh in an asset, though more modern practices recommend such referencing to be to a mesh library asset.

;KUID2
: A updated and update tracking modified version of the KUID format which allows a version number to be specified. A &lt;code&gt;&lt;kuid:xxx:yyy&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the same as saying &lt;code&gt;&lt;kuid2:xxx:yyy:0&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (Zero revisions or version zero, '''''meaning the original''''')
:* This allows data items (Trainz Assets) to carry an inherent version code for the asset. This will not generally match the {{N3V|Trainz-build|CM Trainz-build code}} identifying the software technology levels, but indicates previous versions history.
:* Assets having a higher suffixed code in the KUID2 override or replace older assets, given both the assets in the data base. Having an early version is not necessary but {{TL|CM}} will list the missing chain of revisions as missing dependencies, a software bug to those who resent the contamination of that facility in CM or 'feature' kept as is by the programmers, in any respect reducing the utility of using CM to identify what a user is missing, and causing users to spend time manually figuring out what is really what.

{{anchor|trainz-build tags|trainz-build tag|Trainz-build Tag|Trainz-build Tags|Trainz-build tag|trainz-build}}
&amp;nbsp;

===trainz-build tag===
: ''Main coverage: [[Trainz/tags/trainz-build tags|trainz-build tag]]''{{FAB-todo|
;make redirects:
: ''[[Trainz/references/trainz-build tag]], &lt;br/&gt;[[Trainz/trainz-build tag]]''}}
:''type:'' One decimal point floating point number {{TG|E|Enumerate}}d by N3V&lt;ref name=&quot;trainz-build&quot;/&gt; to track and identify data types corresponding to the technical level of the evolved software. 
:* Each legal value must exactly match a released Trainz {{TL|version number}}. 
::* Values are Trainz 1.0=v1.0, Trainz 1+SP1 =V1.1, TRS2004-sp0 = v2.0 then incremented, where each is incremented by 0.1 from 2.0 to present releases (v3.7 = TS12-SP1). {{TG|H|Hotfixes}} do not change version numbers.
:::* with these exceptions:
:::: V1.4 was Paintshed's release 
:::: the gap between 1.5 and 2.0 was either foreign language releases, or as seems likely, unused.
::* from v2.0 ({{TL|TRS2004}}) onwards the Trainz-build tag number values have been continuous though non-monotonic Trainz TS09-sp3&amp;mdash;TS09-sp4 share some {{N3V|trainz-build|Trainz-build}}&lt;ref name=&quot;trainz-build&quot;&gt;{{plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/%22Trainz-build%22_tag|&quot;Trainz-build&quot; tag}} direct link&lt;/ref&gt; values overlap in TS2009 and TS2010's joint development era.
:''field definition:'' '''The file format version to which this asset is built''' (and archived) not necessarily anything to do with technology levels used by the asset, but corresponds to the asset level assigned by creating an asset in {{TA|Content Creator Plus}}&amp;mdash;the same as will be found in the title bar of {{TL|CM}}.
* The programmer's recommend this number should generally be set to the Trainz version number of the Trainz installation on which the asset is being created and tested. The Content Creator community, in contrast tries to set the number as low as possible to give the new asset the widest possible audience/user scope when downloaded. The better content creators will test it on a naked install (no added content) of the corresponding versions as well as verifying the generated cdp contains all relevant materials.
* Some asset kinds are parsed significantly differently depending on their ''trainz-build'' version tag. NOTE: The ''{{TR|S|trainz-build|p=trainz-build tag}}'' is compulsory. If not specified, Trainz will make a primitive attempt to guess at a legacy Trainz version based on the contents of the {{TR|R|config.txt_file}}.
{{anchor|username|Username|Username Tag|Username tag|username tags}}
&amp;nbsp;

===username tag===
:''type:'' UTF-8 string, ''username'' of asset, '''mandatory''' specification.
:''field definition:'' The '''English''' human-visible name for this asset.
 
In trainz-builds after TC1&amp;2 (v2.7), the username also becomes the operating system folder name when the asset is edited, and asset-filename is ignored, whereas it took precedence through v2-6 config files. Per the TBS standards by N3V games, this field should '''''never contain non-English text''''', except where the asset name is a Proper Noun (eg. a place name) with no English localized variant. This value is the datum everyone usually searches for and remembers, so keeping a clear name is recommended. 
{{TrainzTip|When creating an asset, highly recommended one vetts a new proposed name against several trial partial names in CM searches and from that knowledge adopt a name which matches sensibly with existing available content. &lt;br/&gt;How many 'house 2' or 'road' assets do we need tolerate to confuse us further!? Okay, In practice, we all search house and select from images, but it's darn nice to be able to specify a unique name and get what you expected!}}
&amp;nbsp;
{{anchor|username-xx tag||username-xx|username-XX|Username-XX|Username-XX Tag|Username-XX tag|username-XX tags}}
&amp;nbsp;

===username-XX tags===
:''type:'' UTF-8 string, alternative language versions of the [[#username tag|username tag]].
:''field definition:'' (Where ''XX'' is replaced with the appropriate {{N3V|%22String-table%22_container|localization code}} for the language being represented.) The localized human-visible name for this asset. This field is similar to the ''username'' field except representing a non-English locale. Multiple ''username-XX'' tags may be present in an asset, once for each supported locale. If the appropriate 'username-XX' tag is not present to represent this asset on a given end-user system, the English ''username'' tag is used instead.
{{anchor|description|Description|Description Tag|Description tag|description tags}}
&amp;nbsp;

===description tag===
:''type:'' UTF-8 multi-line string, providing a clear language description of the asset.
:''field definition:'' The '''English''' human-visible descriptive summary for this asset. 
The description is visible in the Content Manager 'Asset Details' pane, and is used to clarify the asset name, provide specs, and often a bit of history.
 
N3V's Chris Bergmann has stated this field should be kept to a short (1-2 paragraph) blurb describing the asset and extended details should be provided via an ''info-url'' page, but quite lengthy blocks of text are tolerated. Some use the bottom of the block as a version change record.
 
This field ''must be'' comprised of '''''English descriptive text''''', although the text may reference non-English Proper Nouns as explained elsewhere. Other language translations or source text are to be placed in one of the many possible alternative language localization tags (see [[#description-XX tag|description-xx tag]]).
{{anchor|description-xx|description-xx tag|description-XX|Description-XX|Description-XX Tag|Description-XX tag|Description-XX tags|description-XX tag}}
&amp;nbsp;

===description-XX tags===
:''type:'' UTF-8 multi-line string, [[Trainz/references/TrainzBaseSpec#description_tag|description tag]].
:''field definition:'' (Where ''XX'' is replaced with the appropriate {{N3V|%22String-table%22_container|localization code}} for the language being represented.) The localized human-visible descriptive summary for this asset. This field is similar to the ''description'' field except representing a non-English locale. Multiple ''description-XX'' tags may be present in an asset, once for each supported locale. If the appropriate 'description-XX' tag is not present to represent this asset on a given end-user system, the English ''description'' tag is used instead.
&amp;nbsp;

===string-table container===
:''type:'' UTF-8 string list container, the {{N3V|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/%22String-table%22_container|String-table}}.
:''field definition:'' A key-value list of '''English''' strings. Each key is a meaningful script identifier mapped to and referenced by binary data. Each value is an '''English''' string. An English string may comprise of or reference a non-English Proper Noun.
Other languages are supported by similar string-tables with a localization code suffix, but have the same key-values in the right hand entries, which serve as an index or look-up table referenced by the binary data of the asset. See string-table-XX for further information.

===string-table-XX container===
:''type:'' UTF-8 string list container, the '''localized string-tables''', each suffix corresponding to languages other than English.
:''field definition:'' (Where ''XX'' is replaced with the appropriate {{N3V|%22String-table%22_container|localization code}} for the language being represented.) This field is similar to the ''string-table'' field except representing a non-English locale. 
 
The English string-table (no suffix) is mandatory, other localization languages are optional at the behest of the asset author. Many assets submitted to the DLS and then also used on routes bundled with a Trainz release will generally be translated and have a full set of localization translations for description-XX and the string-table. In particular, the routes and sessions bundled with a release receive professional translations into multiple languages with each retail release.
 
Note that the left column of the string-tables is identical as it is a mapped symbol table, and index into the binary data such as the mesh, session, or route files. It is only the use names, the right hand or data element of the two elements which are localized and substituted by the run-time localization software. These can be manually edited for more user friendly names if desired, even in the English string-table. The index or left reference column syntax must not be changed in any respect, so be careful with global SAR specifications if changing names in the data column. 

Multiple ''string-table-XX'' tags may be present in an asset, once for each supported language. Each should contain a list of strings with the same Keys as in the ''string-table'' list, but with different Values. If the appropriate 'string-table-XX' tag is not present to represent this asset on a given end-user system, or the appropriate string is missing from the that list, the English ''string-table'' container is referenced instead.

===kuid-table container===
:''type:'' KUID list container, the {{TR|C|Kuid-table}}.
:''field definition:'' The key-value delineating the list of assets upon which this asset is dependent. 
* The internal keywords are {{TG|P|placeholder parameters}}, keywords which may be any unique value (typically, zero-indexed sequential integers.&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Zero indexed numbers are commonplace in programming for management of arrays of similar data and correspond to the multiple of the physical step (byte-count) in a contiguous data-block. Assuming (part of defining and allocating the memory block) each element has the same size, the zero-indexed address (pointer) can be computed by knowing and adding the base memory address (first byte of the [0]th element, plus the data-element size times the index. (the first element with index of zero calculates to itself).&lt;/ref&gt;) 
* Entries in this table serve two purposes - firstly, to ensure that the game systems are aware of the dependency such that installing and loading this asset will successfully install and load any dependencies, and secondly to allow scripts to locate relevant child assets. Only first-level dependencies are included.  Circular dependencies are legal.  An asset cannot be listed as a dependency if it is also marked as an obsolete version of this asset.  An asset cannot be listed as its own dependency.

===obsolete-table container===
:''type:'' KUID list container, the {{TR|C|Kuid-table}}.
:''field definition:'' A key-value list of assets which are made obsolete by this asset. Any attempt to load an asset referenced in this list will result in this asset being loaded instead. The assets referenced in this list must have the same creator as this asset. It is illegal for two assets to both mark a third asset obsolete, unless one of the two also marks the other as obsolete. Circular obsolete references are illegal. All lower-numbered KUID2 versions of this asset are implied as obsolete and need not be included in this list.  It is illegal to mark a higher-numbered KUID2 version of this asset as obsolete as that creates an implicit circular reference.
{{anchor|category-region tags|category-region tag|category-region|Category-region tags|Category-region Tags|Category-region}}
&amp;nbsp;

===category-region tag===
:purpose: Filters in CM and Surveyor (searching criteria)
:''type:'' enumerated string or string-array.
:''field definition:'' A list of two-character {{TR|s|category-region}} codes, separated by semi-colons (';'). No other characters (including whitespace, etc.) should be present in the string. This asset is considered relevant to each of the specified regions - this is most relevant for {{TR|Kinds|KIND Traincar}} and {{TR|Kinds|KIND MOSignal}} assets, but may be supplied for any asset.

{{anchor|category-class tag|Category-class|Category-class tag|category-class}}
&amp;nbsp;

===category-class tag===
:purpose: Filters in CM and Surveyor (searching criteria); determines with KIND declaration how CM software processes the asset, and where Surveyor lists it.
:''type:'' enumerated string.
:''field definition:'' A single 2-3 character {{TOL|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/Category-class|category-class}} code which describes this content item. The ''category-class'' tag is used to provide additional human sub-categorization beyond what is implicit from the Asset Kind. Each Trainz asset's category-class tag helps describe the 'intent' of the Asset in the game, as opposed to the internal structure of the Asset.
{{TrainzTip|BG=#f9f9f9| 
The '''{{N3V|Content_Creator's_Guide|Content Creator's Guide}} (CCG)''' for TRS2006 &amp; CCG for Trainz Classics explained these classes represent a standardized system for referring to the various types of Locos, Rolling stock, Scenery, Spline and Industry assets. The Category-class classification codes become important to all Trainzers when searching and/or filtering for suitable assets to make into content in a session or route (layout).}}
&amp;nbsp;

Note that many category-class codes are only relevant to specific Asset Kinds - category-class codes must not be applied to assets of an inappropriate Kind.

===category-era tag===
:purpose: Filters in CM and Surveyor (searching criteria)
:''type:'' enumerated formats string-array.
:''field definition:'' A list of five-character {{TG|E|era code}}, separated by {{wp|semi-colon}}s (&lt;b&gt;';'&lt;/b&gt;). Each era code represents a decade as an 's' terminated, four digit integer (e.g. &quot;1990s;2000s;2010s&quot;), a token which must be an exact match for one of the specified legal {{TR|references|era code}}s.

:''field definition:'' The thumbnail(s) which are used to represent this asset in 2D preview boxes, lists, and icon form throughout the game environment (including in-game, in {{TL|references|Content Manager}}, and on the {{TL|references|Download Station}}.) Each data set is included in a sub-container using a {{TG|P|placeholder parameter}} as the key name or tag. Convention makes these 0 indexed numbers, but the value can be any non-null text value that can be evaluated as a {{TG|S|string}}.
;An actual example: (from an asset fix edit&lt;ref&gt;per fabartus, summer, 2014; likely the same day this example was added.&lt;/ref&gt;)
&lt;pre&gt;
thumbnails {
	0 {
		width					240
		height					180
		image					&quot;$Screenshot (240)(kuid 68787 25222).jpg&quot;
	}
	1 {
		width					512
		height					512
		image					&quot;$Screenshot (512)(kuid 68787 25222).jpg&quot;
	}
}&lt;/pre&gt;
The other common size is the 128x64 'icon' used in {{TL|Railyard}}, which should have an {{TA|AlphMask}} or a very light background.
&amp;nbsp;

==Software linking==
===info-url tag===
:''type:'' URL string.
:''field definition:'' A link to an online description of this asset. The URL must resolve to a site within the {{N3V|Trainz Online Security Zone}}. The use of custom {{N3V|Trainz Short URL}} formats is recommended to future-proof the URL against possible future site layout changes. Where this tag is present, in-game buttons are provided to allow the user to view the asset description without leaving the game environment. It is recommended that generic group pages are used for entire classes of asset in any case where the assets provide similar functionality but minor differences in appearance. This reduces the time-expense of creating, maintaining and localizing such documentation.

===must-have-product-rights tag===
:''type:'' ascii string.
:''field definition:'' A list of required product rights, separated by semi-colons (';'). If the local installation does not have the required product rights then the asset may not be loaded by certain game systems.
&amp;mdash;
===must-not-have-product-rights tag===
:''type:'' ascii string.
:''field definition:'' A list of conflicting product rights, separated by semi-colons (';'). If the local installation has one of the listed product rights then the asset may not be loaded by certain game systems.
{{anchor|Privileges|Privileges Tag|privileges}}
&amp;nbsp;

===privileges container===
:''type:'' The {{N3V|&quot;privileges&quot; container|privileges DRM container}}.
:''field definition:'' A set of privileges set by the asset creator to control how this asset can be used.
&lt;pre&gt;
privileges {
  permit-commit 1
  permit-edit 1
  permit-listing 1
  is-payware-content 0 
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{anchor|script|Script|Script Tag|Script tag}}
&amp;nbsp;
===script tag===
:''type:'' string filename.
:''field definition:'' Indicates the filepath of the primary script file for this asset, if any. This filepath should always end in a &quot;.gs&quot; extension - the runtime will attempt to add or substitute a &quot;.gs&quot; extension if the filepath has an alternative extension.
{{anchor|class|Class|Class Tag|Class tag}}
&amp;nbsp;

===class tag===
:''type:'' string.
:''field definition:'' Indicates the ''script class'' name to load as the primary class for this asset, if any. This class is loaded from the primary script file for this asset.
{{anchor|script-include-table|Script-include-table|Script-include-table Container|Script-include-table container}}
&amp;nbsp;

===script-include-table container===
:''type:'' List of kuid-parameters and corresponding names as keys.
:''field definition:'' A key-value table of scripted assets which are searched for script includes when compiling this asset's script file(s). The key (a variable, ''so NOT a Tag'') is currently unused but must be unique; the value indicates the KUID of the asset to include.
The {{plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/KIND_TrainzBaseSpec#script-include-table|script-include-table container}} is a top-level {{TA|config.txt file}} entry available to any Asset which derives from KIND TrainzBaseSpec (in short, all Assets.) This container allows the asset to directly {{plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/Script_Include_Directive|include another asset's scripts}} from the parent asset's script file(s) using the {{N3V|TrainzScript|N3V TrainzScript's}} {{N3V|Script_Include_Directive}}.
;related
The extensions container is a list of custom tags or subcontainers with a specific naming convention.

====S-I-T container Supported Tags====
This container is a simple key-value table of names of scripted assets and their kuids which are searched for script includes when compiling the asset's script file(s). The key or tag-name is currently unused (i.e. is a {{TG|P|placeholder parameter}}) in searching; the value indicates the KUID of the asset to include. Being able to search and identify key-names is a content creator requested feature, so using the scriptfile names instead of numeric dummy tag-names is suggested as a best practice, for it conveys more than a kuid-reference.

====S-I-T container Validation====
It is typically best to restrict such references to [[KIND Library]] assets, however this is not mandatory and any assets can be referenced.

====S-I-T container Example====
 script-include-table {
                        a-key        &lt;kuid:nnnn:nnnnn&gt;
                        enginespec   &lt;kuid2:www:xxxxx:yy&gt;
                        anim-doors   &lt;kuid:tttt:uuuuuu&gt;
                      }
&amp;nbsp;

===extensions container===
:''type:'' The {{TR|C|Extensions}}.
:''field definition:'' A set of extended attributes which provide additional information to scripts beyond the {{TL|references|Config.txt file}} specifications defined for this asset type. Care should be taken to abide by the extensions naming guidelines when creating a new extension, and to abide by the extension-creator's guidelines when providing data for an existing extension. Auran reserves the right to add validation for specific entries in the {{TR|C|Extensions}} at a later date, based on the extension-creator's guidelines.
&amp;nbsp;

----
==Newer and less often seen==
The below key-words are relatively new developments and won't have analogs or presence in older assets.
&amp;nbsp;

===category-keyword tag===
:''type:'' UTF-8 string.
:''field definition:'' A list of natural-language keywords, separated by semi-colons (';'). No other characters (including whitespace or irrelevant punctuation) should be present in the string. These keywords form the basis for asset keyword searching. The asset's name need not be repeated in the ''category-keyword'' list. Various {{TR|references|default search keywords}} are supplied automatically based on the asset type, so need not, and possibly should not be repeated. {{TRS-check|is there a length limit like that of #custom-category-list?}}
&amp;nbsp;

===custom-category-list===
:''type:'' ascii string.
:''field definition:'' A list of custom category identifiers, separated by semi-colons (';'). Each {{N3V|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/KIND_TrainzBaseSpec#custom-category-list&lt;!-- link title still a  redlink May 20th 2014 --- |custom_category_identifier---&gt;|custom category identifier}} should be a short (eg. 3-6 character) alphanumeric token. No other characters (including whitespace) should be present in the string. These custom categories are used to enable scripts to rapidly locate certain classes of asset. It is strongly recommended that new custom category identifiers are introduced sparingly. The ''custom-category-list'' tag value may have no more than 64 characters total. This tag should be left blank unless there is an existing specific script requirement that can only be fulfilled via the custom-category-list approach.
&amp;nbsp;
===member-of-groups container===
:''Min-build:'' V3.5 and above
:''type:'' {{TR|C|Member-of-groups}} paired list of {{TG|placeholder parameters}} and {{TR|KD|Asset-group}} kuids.
:''field definition:'' A list of {{N3V|KIND_Asset-group}} assets to which this asset belongs. See the {{TR|K|KIND Asset-group}} documentation for details on how and when this is used.
 
The container holds a regular list of KIND Asset-group KUIDs. This inclusion is a declaration stating that there-after, particularly in searching operations (including script interfacing and TrainzUtil), this asset will be considered as a member of each listed asset group.

If no entries are specified for a given &quot;member-of-groups&quot; container, or if the asset omits the &quot;member-of-groups&quot; container, then the simulator software may specify some default asset groups based on the asset's Config.txt file. The exact behaviour may change between different versions of the simulator, however the current logic is described [http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/KIND_Asset-group#Interpretation here]. 
&amp;nbsp;

==Optional depreciated tags ==
;The following tags are never mandantory for any asset, and many assets leave them blank.
: Historically, the identification and licensing tags began with Trainz 0.9 (Beta).
&amp;nbsp;
===license===
:''type:'' UTF-8 multi-line string.  (Depreciated by programmer fiat.)
:''field definition:'' A license describing how the asset creator would like this asset to be used. Most often seen are license statements prohibiting use of the copyrighted asset in any payware route, dependent assets (e.g. train parts like bogeys, couplers, etc.) or reskin, including distributing the asset on any site which is for-pay operated. (This is theoretically correct even for the DLS. The FCT fees are for faster access and unlimited downloads, not for access to the assets.)
:* Most assets on the DLS are badly worded versions of what is known as the {{plain link|https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License|Creative Commons Share Alike with Attribution}} (CC-BY-SA) like this and other Wikimedia wiki projects.
: The meaning of the ''license'' tag is ambiguous and its usage is not recommended by N3V, but it's presence antedates N3V's management by 6-7 years.
: Content uploaded to the {{TL|references|Download Station}} or provided for inclusion into the game may be under a specific redistribution contract or license agreement which supersedes any text in this field. The license field does not provide for localization support. The text of the license field is not validated or enforced by Auran or N3V and may or may not be legally binding to end users.

: OTOH, history at Planet Auran has shown that someone violating copyrights by using others content as their own, may bring speedy banning from the Auran sites and loss of download station privileges, etcetera in a permanent block. Further, the community will come down hard on other users violating another's copyright, and shun both the violator and ignore any assets allowed to remain on the DLS.
 
: In summation, experimenting and altering assets is ''an accepted and even condoned way of life'' for Trainzer's trying to climb the steep content creation learning curves (everyone wants more content creators!), but if the asset has dependent parts, especially meshes, scripts, textures, which are intellectual properties&amp;mdash; before uploading your creation, get permission to use those pieces belonging to someone else. 
{{TrainzTip
|Asset parts specified ''by '{{TN|K|kuid reference}}' ''are not meant to be covered by this statement&amp;mdash;using a common coupler, bogey, or basic traincar mesh (Auran minted several standard types which many authors use by default by making a kuid reference to the mesh, for example examine dependencies of Boxcars (UK: Covered Wagons or Vans)&amp;mdash;over half are likely using a kuid reference to a basic mesh published by Auran back in Trainz 1.0!)}}

===author tag===
:''type:'' UTF-8 string. (Depreciated in favor of updatable {{plain link|https://www.auran.com/planetauran/com_search.php|Planet Auran database}}.)
:''field definition:'' The author's name or mark. The use of this field is not recommended as attribution can be determined programmatically. 
{{anchor|organization|Organization|Organisation|Organisation tag|Organisation Tag|organization tag}}

===organisation tag===
;note the British spelling, the North American spelling 'organization' also works!
:''type:'' UTF-8 string. (Depreciated in favor of updatable {{plain link|https://www.auran.com/planetauran/com_search.php|Planet Auran database}}.)
:''field definition:'' The name or mark of the organization responsible for the creation of this asset. The use of this field is not recommended as attribution can be determined programmatically. 
{{anchor|Contact-email tag|Contact-email Tag|contact-email}}
&amp;nbsp;
===contact-email tag===
:''type:'' string, ''email address''. (Depreciated in favor of updatable {{plain link|https://www.auran.com/planetauran/com_search.php|Planet Auran database}}.)
:''field definition:'' The contact email address for the creator of this asset. The use of this field is not recommended as attribution can be determined programmatically and contact details can be registered against the creator's {{N3V|Planet Auran account}} where they can be limited or updated as necessary. 
{{anchor|Contact-website tag|Contact-website Tag|contact-website}}
&amp;nbsp;
===contact-website tag===
:''type:'' URL string. (Depreciated in favor of updatable {{plain link
|https://www.auran.com/planetauran/com_search.php|Planet Auran database}}.)
:''field definition:'' The contact website for the creator of this asset. The use of this field is not recommended as attribution can be determined programmatically and {{plain link|https://www.auran.com/planetauran/view_profile.php?ViewingUserID=156702|contact details}} can be registered against the creator's {{N3V|Planet Auran account}} where they can be limited or updated as necessary. 
&amp;nbsp;

==Obsoleted tags==
{{anchor|asset-name tag|category-era-nn tag|asset-name|category-era-nn}}
{{TrainzTip|The following 'tag list' are ''''''de facto'''''' because their convention antedate the above listed TBS tags and specification for using them, and indeed, also antedates the coining of the term TrainzBaseSpec, or it's formal definition.}}

These TrainzBaseSpec tags' ''are obsolescent by programmer fiat in TS2009-SP0 and all releases after it and will generate errors if the asset is upgraded to {{TR|S|trainz-build}} V2.9 and greater data models:

* '''asset-name''', '''name''', and '''name-XX''' &amp;mdash; V1.3&amp;ndash;v2.8 &amp;mdash;found historically in virtually all scenery, spines, and Trackside assets. Asset-name was the primary folder name for the asset in the Trainz 1.x--TRS2004 Trainz era; within such assets today one generally finds the asset-name is also used for that early-Trainz era's data sub-folder's system, giving sub-folder names 'asset-name_art', 'asset-name_body', 'asset-name_shadow' in a traincar asset, and perhaps others in other types. 
{{anchor|name|name-XX|name tag|name-XX tag}}
&amp;nbsp;
* ''''name'''' and ''''name-XX'''' were early forms of the longer tags {{TBS|username}} and {{TBS|username-XX}}, the XX representing ISO two letter suffixes of non-English language translations of the English 'name tag' (or today's 'username' tag); the 'XX' forms as with {{TBS|description-XX}} being part of 'Localisation' support for other language's user-friendly values.
:* Replace with username and username-XX in oldest Trainz era (v1.0-v2.4) assets if present, or delete.  
{{TrainzTip|Note: Username (English) is the official asset name on the DLS, and should never be in a foreign language; it also supercedes and replaces 'asset-filename'.
Subfolder names by convention will have pathspec names beginning with the username/asset-name field and utilize the suffixes _art, _body, and _shadow as part of the normal naming conventions. This may be a {{TN|3ds Max}} and {{TG|G|gmax}} convention carried over into Trainz, which has historical ties to said graphics development software. (Gmax was bundled with Trainz releases V0.9&amp;mdash;v2.4)
}}
{{anchor|category-era-nn|category-era-0|category-era-1|category-era-2|category-era-nn tag|category-era-0 tag|category-era-1 tag|category-era-2 tag}}
&amp;nbsp;
* '''category-era-nn''' &amp;mdash; V1.3&amp;ndash;v2.8 s.a. {{TN|S|{tag: category-era-0, category-era-1, category-era-2, ...&amp;#125;}} &amp;mdash;a former dating system with a numeric suffix&amp;mdash;found historically in virtually all date-worthy assets upto Trainz-build 2.4 when the current {{TBS|category-era}} string array was introduced to combine these onto a single config.txt line. While not directly accessible in Surveyor, after TR06 and CMP, one could define a filter to select a date range and use that filter along with region and type in Surveyor to vett assets that were listable in Surveyor's placement and selection tools. Obsoleted in and after TS09 which uses the shorter {{TBS|category-era}} {{TG|S|string array}} in a single line instead of using multiple '-nn' suffixed tag-value pairs.
:* Whitespace in the string array will cause an error; all values must be suffixed with an 's' and have four digits, s.a. ''1880s;1950s;2010s'' (which might be wholly appropriate for a woman's garment of certain types that go in and out of fashion!). Defining a range is alas, not currently possible, but has been requested by the user community.

:* Replace with string-array type {{TR|T|category-era}} with no whitespace and semi-colons between date codes; these are given as full four digit decade numbers followed by a 's' (Small Ess) suffix.
{{anchor|category-region-nn|category-region-nn tag}}
&amp;nbsp;
* types '''category-region-nn''' &amp;mdash; V1.3&amp;ndash;v2.8 &amp;mdash;found historically in virtually all locale-worthy assets. These have been superceded by ''the 'string-array' of two letter enumerated ISO country codes'' in the {{TBS|category-region}} tag.
:* Replace with string-array type {{TBS|category-region}} with no whitespace and semi-colons between the two character country codes enumerated in that referenced tag section; these are given as full two uppercase letters comprising {{TN|E|enumerated}} codes followed by a ';' separator between codes, but not at the last before the terminal end-quotes.
:* Any {{wp|whitespace}} in the string array will cause an read error, and fault message, including space(s) at the end before the trailing quotes.
{{anchor|region|region tag}}
&amp;nbsp;
* '''region''' &amp;mdash;valid part of TBS V1.3&amp;ndash;v2.8 as a built-in filter and Map asset custom localization identifier (kuid); now the only legal tag use is in {{TR|KD|KIND Map}} (layout) assets. 
::As a former filter modifier, the tag is found historically in virtually all assets, but it was especially prevalent in rolling stock, scenery, spline assets, Track types (including tunnels and bridges) and Trackside assets with a degree of localisation. 
:* Map assets still retain the keyword Region which was defined in Map configs with a contrary use&amp;mdash;to be a {{TR|KD|KIND region}} {{TN|K|kuid reference}}. Hence, Region '''''&lt;u&gt;is required in Maps&lt;/u&gt;''''', and since TRS2012, like the tag type, illegal in the very large number of assets where it once occurred as data.
:* Any region tag to a text string is obsolete after the TRS2009, as in the programmer's mind they replaced the ''crude filtering'' group selector of 'type and region' string-values in the Surveyor tools with the {{TA|Pick List}}. Both these tags had some benefits and drawbacks and both date back to Trainz 0.9 Beta release. 
{{anchor|type|type tag}}

* '''type''' &amp;mdash; V1.3&amp;ndash;v2.8 &amp;mdash;a former filter modifier, and found historically in virtually all assets, but were especially prevalent in rolling stock, scenery, spines, Track types (including tunnels and bridges) and Trackside assets. Type was used in Trainz 0.9&amp;mdash;TC3 releases as an in Surveyor filter which combined with region, gave groups of assets instead of being overwhelmed by a whole list of placement tool selections. Both defaulted to 'All' giving the same mega-list as tools do in TS09 and after.
:* Every type tag is obsolete after the TRS2006 spinoffs (i.e. TC3), as in the programmer's mind they replaced the ''crude filtering'' group selector of 'type and region' in the Surveyor tools with the {{TL|TS09}} {{TL|Pick List}}.

The SQL standard knows three kinds of data types
:* predefined data types
:* constructed types
:* user-defined types.

This page presents only the '''''predefined data types'''''. ''Constructed types'' are one of ARRAY, MULTISET, REF(erence) or
ROW. ''User-defined types'' are comparable to classes in object-oriented language with their own constructors, observers, mutators, methods, inheritance, overloading, overwriting, interfaces and so on.

== Overview ==
The standard groups predefined data types into types with similar characteristics.

*Character Types
:*Character (CHAR)
:*Character Varying (VARCHAR)
:*Character Large Object (CLOB)
*Binary Types
:*Binary (BINARY)
:*Binary Varying (VARBINARY)
:*Binary Large Object (BLOB)
*Numeric Types
:*Exact Numeric Types (NUMERIC, DECIMAL, SMALLINT, INTEGER, BIGINT)
:*Approximate Numeric Types (FLOAT, REAL, DOUBLE PRECISION)
*Datetime Types (DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP)
*Interval Type (INTERVAL)
*Boolean
*XML

Character types hold printable characters, binary types any binary data. Both may have a fixed or variable size with an upper limit. If the upper limit exeeds a certain value the type is a 'large object' with special methods and functions. 

Exact numeric types hold numeric values without digits after the decimal or with a firm number of digits after the decimal.

Approximate numeric types hold numeric values with an implementation defined precision (after the decimal).

Temporal types hold values for INTERVAL (a certain range on the time bar), DATE (year, month, day), TIME with and without TIMEZONE (name of timezone, hour, minute, second including fraction) and TIMESTAMP with and without TIMEZONE (name of timezone, year to second including fraction).

The boolean data type holds the two values ''true'' and ''false''.

Part 14 of the SQL standard extends the list of predefined data types by introducing the data type XML (Oracle calls it XMLType) together with a bunch of particular functions. Columns of this type hold XML instances.

In the outdated SQL-2 standard there was a data type 'BIT'. This data type is no longer part of the standard.

Most DBMS implement the majority of predefined data types, but there are some exceptions. Also the naming differs slightly. An overview about the major implementations is available in the wikibook [[SQL_Dialects_Reference]].

Data types are used within the CREATE TABLE statement as part of column definitions - or during CAST operations.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot; style=&quot;background:LightGreen&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE &lt;tablename&gt; (
  &lt;column_name&gt; &lt;data_type&gt; ... ,
  &lt;column_name&gt; &lt;data_type&gt; ... ,
  ...
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Character ==
A series of printable characters - which is a string - can be stored within ''character string types''. If all rows of a table use the same fixed size for the strings, the data type is &lt;code&gt;CHAR(&lt;n&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;n&gt; is the size of the strings. If the size varies from row to row, the data type &lt;code&gt;VARCHAR(&lt;n&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; defines that '''up to''' &lt;code&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;/code&gt; characters can be stored in the column. So &lt;code&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;/code&gt; defines the upper limit for this column. The maximum value for &lt;code&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;/code&gt; depends on the used DBMS implementation. If applications need to store longer strings than it is allowed by this upper system limit, the data type &lt;code&gt;CLOB&lt;/code&gt; must be used. Also &lt;code&gt;CLOB&lt;/code&gt; has its own upper limit, but this is significantly greater than the upper limit of &lt;code&gt;VARCHAR&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A table with columns of fixed and variable size strings and a CLOB string
CREATE TABLE datatypes_1 (
  id    DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  col_1 CHAR(10),       -- exactly 10 characters
  col_2 VARCHAR(150),   -- up to 150 characters
  col_3 CLOB            -- very large strings (MySQL denotes this data type: 'LONGTEXT')
);
&lt;/source&gt;

Hint: Unlike other programming languages SQL does not distinguish between a ''character data type'' and a ''string data type''. It knows only the ''character string data types'' CHAR, VARCHAR and CLOB.

== Binary ==
Binary data types are similar to character data types. They differ in that they accept a different range of bytes. Binary data types accept all values.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A table with columns of fixed and variable size binary data and a BLOB
CREATE TABLE datatypes_2 (
  id    DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  col_1 BINARY(10),     -- exactly 10 byte
  col_2 VARBINARY(150), -- up to 150 byte
  col_3 BLOB            -- very large data: jpeg, mp3, ...
);
&lt;/source&gt;

A hint to Oracle users: The data type &lt;code&gt;BINARY&lt;/code&gt; is not supported, the data type &lt;code&gt;VARBINARY&lt;/code&gt; is denoted as &lt;code&gt;RAW&lt;/code&gt; and is deprecated. Oracle recommends the use of &lt;code&gt;BLOB&lt;/code&gt;.

== Exact Numeric == 
Exact numeric types hold numeric values without digits after the decimal or with a firm number of digits after the decimal. All exact numeric types are signed.

&lt;code&gt;NUMERIC(&amp;lt;p&gt;,&amp;lt;s&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DECIMAL(&amp;lt;p&gt;,&amp;lt;s&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; denotes two types which are nearly the same. &amp;lt;p&gt; (precision) defines a fix number of all digits within the type and &amp;lt;s&gt; (scale) defines how much of them resides behind the decimal place. Numeric values with more than (p - s) digits before the decimal place cannot be stored and numeric values with more than s digits after the decimal place are truncated to s digits after the decimal place. p and s are optional. It must always be: p ≥ s ≥ 0 and p &gt; 0.

SMALLINT, INTEGER and BIGINT denotes data types without a decimal place. The SQL standard did not define their size, but the size of SMALLINT shall be smaller than the size of INTEGER and the size of INTEGER shall be smaller than the size of BIGINT.


&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A table using five exact numeric data types
CREATE TABLE datatypes_3 (
  id    DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  col_1 DECIMAL(5,2),    -- three digits before the decimal and two behind
  col_2 SMALLINT,        -- no decimal point
  col_3 INTEGER,         -- no decimal point
  col_4 BIGINT           -- no decimal point. (Not supported by Oracle.)
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Approximate Numeric ==
Approximate numeric types hold numeric values with an implementation defined precision (after the decimal). All approximate numeric types are signed. Their primary use cases are scientific computations.

There are three types: &lt;code&gt;FLOAT (&amp;lt;p&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DOUBLE PRECISION&lt;code&gt;, where p denotes the garanteed precision of the &lt;code&gt;FLOAT&lt;/code&gt; data type. The precision of &lt;code&gt;REAL&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DOUBLE PRECISION&lt;/code&gt; is implementation defined.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A table using the approximate numeric data types
CREATE TABLE datatypes_4 (
  id    DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  col_1 FLOAT(2),     -- two or more digits after the decimal place
  col_2 REAL,
  col_3 DOUBLE PRECISION
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Temporal ==
Data types with respect to temporal aspects are: &lt;code&gt;DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;INTERVAL&lt;/code&gt;. 

&lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt; stores year, month and day. &lt;code&gt;TIME&lt;/code&gt; stores hour, minute and second. &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; stores year, month, day, hour, minute and second. Seconds can contain digits after the decimal. &lt;code&gt;TIME&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TIMESTAMP&lt;/code&gt; can contain the name of a TIME ZONE.

The SQL standard defines two kinds of INTERVALs. The first one is an interval with year and month, the second one is an interval with day, hour, minute and second.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A table using temporal data types
CREATE TABLE datatypes_5 (
  id    DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  col_1 DATE,                       -- store year, month and day (Oracle: plus hour, minute and seconds) 
  col_2 TIME,
  col_3 TIMESTAMP(9),               -- a timestamp with 9 digits after the decimal of seconds
  col_4 TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,   -- a timestamp including the name of a timezone
  col_5 INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH,
  col_6 INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND(6)   -- an intervall with 6 digits after the decimal of seconds
);
&lt;/source&gt;

A hint to Oracle users: The data type &lt;code&gt;TIME&lt;/code&gt; is not supported. Use &lt;code&gt;DATE&lt;/code&gt; instead.

A hint to MySQL users: The use of TIME ZONE as part of data types is not supported. MySQL implements a different concept to handle time zones. Fractions of seconds are not supported. The data type &lt;code&gt;INTERVAL&lt;/code&gt; is not supported, but there is a data value &lt;code&gt;INTERVAL&lt;/code&gt;.

== Boolean ==
SQL has a 3-value-logic. It knows the boolean values &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;. Columns of the boolean data type can store one of the two values &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; is represented by storing no value, which is the NULL value.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A table with one column of boolean
CREATE TABLE datatypes_6 (
  id    DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  col_1 BOOLEAN     -- not supported by Oracle
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== XML ==
Part 14 of the SQL standard extends the list of predefined data types by introducing the data type XML. The standard also defines a wide range of particular functions for this data type.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- A table with one column of data type XML 
CREATE TABLE datatypes_7 (
  id    DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  col_1 XML
);
&lt;/source&gt;
A hint to Oracle users: The data type &lt;code&gt;XML&lt;/code&gt; is denoted as &lt;code&gt;XMLType&lt;/code&gt;.

A hint to MySQL users: The data type &lt;code&gt;XML&lt;/code&gt; is not supported.

== Domains ==
In the context of data types the standard knows ''domains''. The purpose of domains is to constrain the set of valid values that can be stored in a column. The domain-concept is a very early predecessor of user-defined types and may be outdated.

== Clean Up ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
DROP TABLE datatypes_1;
DROP TABLE datatypes_2;
DROP TABLE datatypes_3;
DROP TABLE datatypes_4;
DROP TABLE datatypes_5;
DROP TABLE datatypes_6;
DROP TABLE datatypes_7;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Exercises ==
&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Create a table 'company' with columns 'id' (numeric, primary key), 'name' (strings of variable size up to 200), 'isin' (strings of length 12), 'stock_price' (numeric with 2 digits before and 2 after the decimal), 'description_text' (a very large string) and description_doc (any binary format).
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE company (
  id               DECIMAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name             VARCHAR(200),
  isin             CHAR(12),
  stock_price      DECIMAL(4,2),
  description_text CLOB,
  description_doc  BLOB
);
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

There's a mention in the text that this is content from MSDN, and it seems that it is at least partially copied (see [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cx9s2sy4.aspx here]).

      <comment>/* Geologic Time */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Geologic Time ==
Geologic time can be measured in two very distinct ways: [[relative dating]], which involves placing geologic events in sequential order, and [[absolute dating]], which utilizes radioactive decay to quantify the number of years that have passed since a particular geologic event. When assessing geologic time, these two fundamentally different ways of measuring geologic time must work in tandem to reveal a more complete understanding of Earth processes.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Cells Turn Nutrients into Usable Energy =

Cells manage a wide range of functions in their tiny package — growing, moving, housekeeping, and so on — and most of those functions require energy. Cellular nutrients come in many forms, including sugars and fats. In order to provide a cell with energy, these molecules have to pass across the cell membrane, which functions as a barrier — but not an impassable one. Like the exterior walls of a house, the plasma membrane is semi-permeable. In much the same way that doors and windows allow necessities to enter the house, various proteins that span the cell membrane permit specific molecules into the cell, although they may require some energy input to accomplish this task.

Complex organic food molecules such as sugars, fats, and proteins are rich sources of energy for cells because much of the energy used to form these molecules is literally stored within the chemical bonds that hold them together. Scientists can measure the amount of energy stored in foods using a device called a bomb calorimeter. With this technique, food is placed inside the calorimeter and heated until it burns. The excess heat released by the reaction is directly proportional to the amount of energy contained in the food.

In reality, of course, cells don't work quite like calorimeters. Rather than burning all their energy in one large reaction, cells release the energy stored in their food molecules through a series of oxidation reactions. Oxidation describes a type of chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred from one molecule to another, changing the composition and energy content of both the donor and acceptor molecules. Food molecules act as electron donors. During each oxidation reaction involved in food breakdown, the product of the reaction has a lower energy content than the donor molecule that preceded it in the pathway. At the same time, electron acceptor molecules capture some of the energy lost from the food molecule during each oxidation reaction and store it for later use. Eventually, when the carbon atoms from a complex organic food molecule are fully oxidized at the end of the reaction chain, they are released as waste in the form of carbon dioxide.

Cells do not use the energy from oxidation reactions as soon as it is released. Instead, they convert it into small, energy-rich molecules such as ATP and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), which can be used throughout the cell to power metabolism and construct new cellular components. In addition, workhorse proteins called enzymes use this chemical energy to catalyze, or accelerate, chemical reactions within the cell that would otherwise proceed very slowly. Enzymes do not force a reaction to proceed if it wouldn't do so without the catalyst; rather, they simply lower the energy barrier required for the reaction to begin.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Cancer Classification =

Cancers are classified in two ways: by the type of tissue in which the cancer originates (histological type) and by primary site, or the location in the body where the cancer first developed. This section introduces you to the first method: cancer classification based on histological type. The international standard for the classification and nomenclature of histologies is the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3).

= Classification by tissue types =
From a histological standpoint there are hundreds of different cancers, which are grouped into six major categories:

* Carcinoma
* Sarcoma
* Myeloma
* Leukemia
* Lymphoma
* Mixed Types (Blastoma)

= Classification by site of origin =

By primary site of origin, cancers may be of specific types like breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer), oral cancer, brain cancer etc.

= Classification by grade =
Cancers can also be classified according to grade. The abnormality of the cells with respect to surrounding normal tissues determines the grade of the cancer. Increasing abnormality increases the grade, from 1–4.

Cells that are well differentiated closely resemble normal specialized cells and belong to low grade tumors. Cells that are undifferentiated are highly abnormal with respect to surrounding tissues. These are high grade tumors.

* Grade 1 – well differentiated cells with slight abnormality
* Grade 2 – cells are moderately differentiated and slightly more abnormal
* Grade 3 – cells are poorly differentiated and very abnormal
* Grade 4 – cells are immature and primitive and undifferentiated

= Classification by stage =
Cancers are also classified individually according to their stage. There are several types of staging methods. The most commonly used method uses classification in terms of tumor size (T), the degree of regional spread or node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M). This is called the TNM staging.

For example, T0 signifies no evidence of tumor, T 1 to 4 signifies increasing tumor size and involvement and Tis signifies carcinoma in situ or limited to surface cells. Similarly N0 signifies no nodal involvement and N 1 to 4 signifies increasing degrees of lymph node involvement. Nx signifies that node involvement cannot be assessed. Metastasis is further classified into two – M0 signifies no evidence of distant spread while M1 signifies evidence of distant spread.

Stages may be divided according to the TNM staging classification. Stage 0 indicates cancer being in situ or limited to surface cells while stage I indicates cancer being limited to the tissue of origin. Stage II indicates limited local spread, Stage II indicates extensive local and regional spread while stage IV is advanced cancer with distant spread and metastasis.

To say happy birthday to your friends, family or someone in Bahasa Indonesia, you can say '''''selamat ulang tahun'''''. Selamat meaning Congratulation and Ulang tahun meaning Birthday, so litterally meaning in english is Congratulation for your Birthday.

=='''How old are you?'''==

Do you remember numerals in Bahasa Indonesia, if you don't, you can check your lesson, because we wil use it. So how we asking ''How old are you'' in Bahasa?. Look the sentences below:
# Berapa usia anda? (formal, polite)
# Berapa usia kamu? (informal, standard)

Please carefully to whom you are talking, if you are talking with a older people than you, you should you the polite form, never use it informal form to people is older than you. You can use the informal form to your friends or people younger than you.

|-
| Umur saya 17 tahun    || My age is 17 years old
|-
| Kamu berumur berapa?   || How old are you? (informal)
|}Note: Indonesia has 2 way to say age there are Usia and Umur. There is no rule for that, you can use one of them, because if you use umur or usia, Indonesian will understand what do you mean. 

==My age is .....==
If you don't remember numerals in Indonesia, look at the table below:

===Group Talk===
Hey Hollie! This is a little confusing for me
[[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 13:37, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

You're the only person from the group I can find on here. And I've no idea if I'm doing this right... [[User:Cir00004|Cir00004]] ([[User talk:Cir00004|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cir00004|contribs]]) 15:54, 18 March 2014 (UTC)


oh hey, whats up [[User:Heyrach|Heyrach]] ([[User talk:Heyrach|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Heyrach|contribs]]) 15:46, 19 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Hollie - George from Megabytes team here - we are doing Always On too - so we're happy to contribute to your stuff - feel free to contribute to ours as well! Our usernames are: StineEliseJ (Elise); Kellymcdonach (Kelly); GemmaMiller (Gemma); Ania-polish accent (Ania); amandajayner (Aj) and George Berrie (that's me). I'll put the same message on your team mates' discussion pages too to see if we can get some cross-team contributions going. Cheers.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 15:09, 27 March 2014 (UTC)


Hey,Hollie. I think just fleshing out the entire page with things we think are missing is all that's really needed at this stage too. I'll probably look at the theorist sections the closest to try and help write a concise summary. Like I said, I already wrote a little bit about Zizek but I don't think there's enough on him to merit his own section. [[User:Cir00004|Cir00004]] ([[User talk:Cir00004|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cir00004|contribs]]) 20:16, 1 April 2014 (

Hi there Hollie :) Just to let you know that I've put up a little lesson plan type thing on my discussion page for our group presentation. It's super vague but it's a starting point to help us think about how we want to structure things and what we want to say. Have a look and I look forward to seeing what you think and hearing any ideas you have! [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

I've also just started our groups little movie thing I was telling you guys about after the seminar. So far it looks pretty good! I'm just making it to be an introduction to the subject and we can develop the actual topic during the seminar itself but I think it's just a interesting thing to add that people might find a little different and hopefully enjoyable :) [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

== Setting out topics ==

Each person in our group should take a specific topic... but we should try and make them all link together, so we should discuss what major topics there are or what we even may be interested in doing and then we can discuss those topics on each persons page and then link our own topics to them too so that we have a large range of knowledge.. am I making sense. I don't mind looking at any topic, I am quite happy with whatever topic. [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:30, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Some topics that could be focused on are the main concepts of Always-On (introducing the topic), key theorists and theories behind the topic (danah boyd, Sherry Turkle, 'tethered'), as well as key terms such as blurred boundaries, ubiquitous, disinhibition, and context cues. Just a few ideas, hoping everyone else has more. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 17:42, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

I think I wan't to have a look at context cues for a little because it's something I never understood 100% in class so this will be good for me to help understand it more... Are you familiar? Give me an outline of what it is? [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 12:50, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I haven't looked at context cues in too much detail, but from what I can gather it basically means that there are certain cues in reality about how we should act - eye contact, inviting someone to a conversation, facial expressions. However, in the virtual world we don't have those so there is a clear lack of them meaning that people may act in ways they don't in person - abruptly, rudely, uninvited etc. Does that make sense? I feel I'm explaining it very long-windedly. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 12:14, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

===Comments===

Hi, I'm Gemma from the Megabytes, we've not heard back from other groups yet but were just wondering what referencing style your group were intending to use. Wiki states that they have no set referencing style yet they like users to keep it consistent (See here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf). Our group thought it would be easier just to stick with APA as that is the set referencing style for Media modules. What do you guys think? Look forward to hearing from you. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 15:23, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi there Gemma, this seems to be the referencing style most others groups are using, so i'm guessing it's okay to use and lie you said it keeps things nice and consistent. I'd say go ahead! It's the style I'll be using from now on anyway... [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

Yeah APA has been used already throughout the page and is easier to stick to, I also think it makes referencing a little easier. I will also have a look at what other groups are doing though... so we can try and see if we can be consistent throughout the wiki book.

== Sherry Turkle ==

Sherry Turkle was another key theorist associated with &quot;Always on&quot; culture and, specifically related to 'the tethered self'. Sherry Turkle was a professor at the Massachusetts institute of Technology. 

&quot;We are tethered to our 'always on/always-on-us' communications devices and the people and things we reach through them: people, Webpages, voice mail, games, artificial intelligences... they live for us through our tethering devices, always ready-to-mind and hand.&quot; (Turkle, &quot;The Tethered Self&quot;)

http://web.mit.edu/sturkle/www/pdfsforstwebpage/ST_Always%20On.pdf

[[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:44, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

== Main Concepts ==

'''Life On the Screen'''

Part of her work was based around computers and the effect they have on us. She developed the ideas of 'cyberspace' - a place where we can, every day, go to interact and connect with people anywhere- and develop relationships with them online. In her piece 'Life on the Screen: Identity in the age of the internet' she said human beings were changing and adapting due to the 'fading boundary' between computers and real life. This related to the 'Always on' Culture as it is adding to her work on looking into the relationship between humans and their technology. 

The concept of being able to go on at any time to speak to someone any where gives the idea of being 'Always on' and in this sense, with a computer. Always having access to these online worlds and being able to be reached from people even when we are not there, we are stil 'always on'. 

'''The Second Self'''

Turkle developed more ideas about the computer and how it is more than a tool now but an actual part of our everyday lives. In 'The Second Self' Turkle conducted interviews as part of her research, this showed that computers are both part of ourselves and part of the external world. 

More ideas here that link in with the concept of being 'Always on' and that computers are part of us and part of our daily lives. We are constantly on-line and connected to them. 
[[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 15:08, 1 April 2014 (UTC)
 
'''Alone Together'''

Turkle published a book in 2011 called 'Alone Together' which was a study on technology and how it is effecting our generations. This is where the main ideas of 'tethering' and 'Always on' culture arose from her. She made points about how we are more connected now than what we have ever been but with that we are still alone. We are replacing our social interactions- conversations and intimacy with texting and communicating through computer use. 

She gave a talk through the website TED called &quot;Connected, but still alone?&quot; here she discussed some of the main points from the book. She talked about the ideas of communication and how it changed who we are and what we do and so we are developing social problems when it comes to being offline. We are now expecting less from each other and more from our technologies altering our relationships and friendships in the outside world and we are also losing valuable skills in conversation and social behaviour do to our new forms of connection and technology.

===Discussion===
Hey, in reply to the comment you left on my discussion, I agree, they are important to include as well.  I focused on the tethered self the most but it would be useful to incorporate the ideas you mentioned.  I think it would be a good idea to at least mention and explain her ideas about it.  Have you researched it yet? [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 15:59, 1 April 2014 (UTC)
Hey Hollie, After you mentioned it to me, I have now added a section to my discussion page about The Second Self and linked that to the idea of Always on Culture. Feel free to edit it and change bits according to the information you have found. [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 21:57, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Hollie - agree with your comments re the Glossary. I've had a go at tidying up the References section - putting it into alphabetical order etc - but haven't checked the actual formatting.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 13:00, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey Hollie, I am a little confused about how we are referencing the wikibooks?? Also to we quote or paraphrase things we have read?? Any help would be great [[User:Heyrach|Heyrach]] ([[User talk:Heyrach|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Heyrach|contribs]]) 13:22, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey Hollie, the information you have is great too! [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 16:05, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Hollie - responded to your referencing query on the Always On discussion page you mentioned - agree with your comments - in view of time left I think we just ask Kelly to get on with doing what she suggests - it would make it consistent and that is the important thing.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 18:56, 2 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

==Online Identity Project==

Hi, Imara! As I was saying earlier today, I thought about something that might be useful for your bit about blending identities and online dating and that's Tinder! Tinder's based on our Facebook profiles, which sort of make people trust it a bit more since it seems to be authentic online identity. But it only uses your FB pictures, interests and friends, but it does allow you to register even if you don't have any FB friends. So you could basically create a totally new FB profile just for Tinder and use somebody else's pictures for it, meaning that it's not as authentic as people think. I don't know if that's relevant to what your doing and you don't have to write anything about it, but I thought it was interesting haha.

= Topics Related to Always-On Culture =


==Online Identity==

-Being “always-on” leads to the constant overlapping of the user's real life identity and online one. Is the user's online identity any less 'real' than their 'real life' identity? Is it maybe just different in as much as they think a lot about what they display about themselves before putting it online, but in face-to-face encounters it is much more 'real time' and they are perhaps a bit more vulnerable to show themselves in a less-than-ideal way - albeit showing a more 'natural' self?

-Online identity is about portraying of self as a living-out of states of being, becoming, belonging and behaving through the range of everyday social and discursive practices that are connected with the body. Yet it is also a close editing of self: ‘it’s me, but minus the things I don’t like about me’ – those aspects of self chosen to be shared with the public. (Thomson, Angela (2007). 'Youth Online. Identity and Literacy in the Digital Age'. p 9) ([[User:Ania-polish accent|Ania-polish accent]] ([[User talk:Ania-polish accent|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ania-polish accent|contribs]]) 23:13, 1 April 2014 (UTC))

-“Always-on” meaning that some feel the need to “check-in”, update their internet status, upload pictures from their real life to portray a specific online identity.  ''(Mendelson, A.L &amp; Papacharissi, Z. 2010. ‘Look at Us: Collective Narcissism in College Student Facebook Galleries’ from &quot;A Networked Self&quot;)''.

-These activities may take up a lot of time and be of great importance to individuals in order to determine an online identity which is always-on and available to access (i.e. Impression Management).

-Always-on with regard to texting, Facebook, email etc. will all contribute to your online identity as they are managed by you and reflect you as a person whether it is informally with friends (text, Facebook) or for a more professional purpose (email, LinkedIn).
José van Dijck (van Dijck 2013) differentiates between Facebook and LinkedIn, the former existing for users’ personal presentation of online identity and the latter for promotion of their professional identity with both organisations using similar means of connectivity. However, he also asserts that both platforms have a “vested interest in pushing the need for a uniform online identity” (p. 200) which may not be in the best interests of users who may want, for example, one identity for friends and another for employers.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 12:31, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

==Technological Determinism==

-Always-on culture bringing about a big cultural shift relating to communication which has been determined by innovations in media technology where the user has the ability to be connected to the internet at all times.

-Technology has the power to transform culture, society and way people look at the world. Due to the advance in technology, people have developed a greater need to be connected to other people via mobiles/computers/tablets and are more likely to share experiences through these forms of communication than face-to-face.

-“Medium is the message” linking to your always-on identity: The medium in which you use to communicate affects the message originally intended. For example, text speak=informal, and has led to a cultural change where “Lol” is used in real conversation and bad punctuation is more frequent.

===&lt;u&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan Marshall McLuhan]&lt;/u&gt;===


[[File:Marshall McLuhan holding a mirror.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=A]]
[[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 19:00, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

McLuhan’s assertion that the medium is the message seems to be becoming more evident as the technology we use is tied in with our identity and what it says about us. Three of the world’s largest technology companies, Google, Intel, and Facebook all announced, almost on the same day, that they were investing heavily in wearable technology. Google announced that it was partnering with Italy's Luxottica, the makers of Ray-Ban sunglasses and Oakley sports glasses to ensure their new smart glasses, Google Glass, were at the cutting edge of fashion (The Guardian, 25th March, 2014; BBC 25th March, 2014). Google Glass is a small screen attached to a pair of glasses which can record video, access email, and retrieve information from the web by connecting wirelessly to a user's mobile phone. Intel, the world’s largest computer chip maker, increased its investment in wearable technology by buying Basis Science, a company that has devices and services for tracking a person’s health, and wanted to accelerate its position in wearable technology (BBC 26th March, 2014). Facebook also made a big investment in wearable technology by buying the virtual reality technology firm Oculus VR for £1.2bn and Mark Zuckerberg going as far as saying that “virtual reality will be the next social communications platform” (The Guardian, 25th March, 2014) and will “change the way we work, play and communicate” (BBC 26th March, 2014).
If these investments by the world’s largest technology companies produce a proliferation of new, fashionable, technology, the reliance on wireless technology and greater bandwidth within that technology, will undoubtedly increase.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 11:27, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

===&lt;u&gt;[http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/hamid-van-koten/1b/40/5ab Hamid Van Koten]&lt;/u&gt;===

Van Koten’s work is of significant relevance to this development in wearable technology, particularly Facebook’s recent acquisition of Oculus VR. In the context of technology providing an extension of our social networks, Van Koten wants to uncover the “shift from the real to the imaginary as the dominant drive towards the consumption of these representations” (Van Koten 2009: p. 89)
He says from a Jungian perspective,” games provide an outlet for the archetypal forces within the collective unconscious. Onscreen we can safely place ourselves in the role of the Hero […] alternatively, in a Freudian sense, games are a means of enacting the Oedipus complex” (Van Koten 2009: p.96). Van Koten’s work build’s on that of McLuhan and it would seem with the three investments made by Google, Intel, and Facebook, the merging of games technology, which allows us to act in an imaginary world in much the same way as described in the disinhibition argument, with social media, his observation of the shift from the real to the imaginary will increase significantly.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 12:40, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

===&lt;u&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier Jaron Lanier]&lt;/u&gt;===

[[File:Jaron lanier.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A]]
[[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 19:00, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

In ''&quot;You are not a gadget: A manifesto&quot;'', Jaron Lanier discusses the many people who partake in the &quot;Always-On&quot; culture, showing that despite the assumption that the majority are teenagers, people from all walks of life can become immersed in it. He lists ''&quot;lifelong friends, my mentors, my students, my colleagues and my fellow travellers.&quot;'' (Lanier, 2011) [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 19:40, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Lanier also said that the most important thing about a technology was how it changed people (Lanier 2011) and, if this is correct, the changes brought about by new wearable technology from Facebook, Google, and Intel promise to change us considerably.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 14:42, 27 March 2014 (UTC)


'''NOTE: MORE INFO NEEDED ON JARON LANIER'''
{{clear}}

==Cognitive Surplus==

-Technology has developed to allow you to create and share your thoughts and ideas. Always-on culture means you can partake in cognitive surplus when you so wish.

-Always-on culture allows to you view collective work online at the touch of a button. For example, Wikipedia is free of data charges in Middle-East and Africa: http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Zero

-Always-on technology has created this new way of collaboration and communication.

=Presentation Information=

We have been assigned the presentation date of &lt;u&gt;'''Tuesday 15th April'''&lt;/u&gt; (Week 10).

At the meeting today, we discussed the Powerpoint required and I have agreed to put the final one together if everyone is okay with this. We spoke about arranging another meeting sometime next week to assign material and create the bare bones of the presentation. Also, if everyone can put time aside for running through and rehearsing the final presentation before the 15th, that would be much appreciated. Any queries, just post it in the comment section below. Thanks. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 15:53, 31 March 2014 (UTC)


I have entered below the guidelines for our presentation which can be found in the Module Handbook:

 A comprehensive, concise and effectively communicated coverage of the content of your 
Wikibook contribution 

 The presentation on the day must be between 15 and 20mins in duration 

 A reflection on group interaction and engagement with each other, with other groups (as 
relevant) and with outside Wikipedians 

 Co-ordinated powerpoint presentation slides (or prezi – but it MUST be co-ordinated 
amongst the group) finished to a professional standard (you know what this word implies, 
this includes its presentation, delivery and technical control) 

 Use your presentation to provide the starting point for a 30-minute class discussion, based 
upon one or two questions that you wish the rest of the seminar to discuss 


A total mark will be given for: 

 Effective communication (delivery, slides, control of materials) 

 Audience engagement (co-ordination of discussion, delegation of tasks) 

 Critical engagement (reflecting upon the group’s contributions to the Wikibook; your 
understanding of the project and its implications) 

Presentations during Weeks 9, 10 &amp; 11. 
Your group’s presentation week will be assigned by the end of play, Week 6.

===&lt;u&gt;Discussion&lt;/u&gt;===

What everyone think about the idea of creating a bit of performance about being 'always-on' during our presentation? I just thought that it could be quite expressive if we simulate a situation where by phoning, sending a text to few members of our team, having a laptop in front of our faces, we can show how disturbing it is to ourselves and others. ([[User:Ania-polish accent|Ania-polish accent]] ([[User talk:Ania-polish accent|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ania-polish accent|contribs]]) 13:05, 2 April 2014 (UTC))

I like that idea, maybe we could have our phones or laptops sitting next to us during the presentation and then announcet that we will be checking them at the end to see how many notifications/texts etc. we have received in that time to emphasise us being &quot;always-on&quot; in relation to being always &quot;available&quot; online even within a short hour of not being on our phones.

=Comments=

Hi Gemma! Thought that was a well thought out start - you've put a lot into it. I've made a small edit - but its more of a question than an edit re online and 'real' identities. [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 12:28, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, thanks very much. I think what you've said is totally correct. I've had difficulty trying to think of a term other than &quot;real life&quot; as our online identity is included in that. I think it's more a case of having the best possible version of yourself put online for the world to see, even though this may not be the most natural or true-to-life version as you've said. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 13:19, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma, you've provided great points and information.  I made some slight changes by changing things like &quot;we&quot; to &quot;the user&quot; etc. [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 16:27, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Perfect, I'm still getting used to the style of the Wikibook. Hopefully reading everyone's entries will give me some insight. Thanks! [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 17:17, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

[Gemma, are you ok if I add a bit here re LinkedIn re the professional bit and also a bit about how Facebook use the new timeline so that they too are managing our online identity and how it is presented? [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:48, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

George - In reply to your edit above, yes that sounds great! All relevant and I think that it should be added, go ahead and feel free to edit/add bits to my section as you wish. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 14:03, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma, just to remind you that we are now going to use the APA style of referencing to keep it consistent. [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 16:07, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma, I've stuck with what was already being used on the Always-On page, so it is Surname, First name (Publication date) Title. Does that help? Or do you think it would be better to go with something different? [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 16:21, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma, I'm having some trouble finding a resource on what cultural/technological determinism is? So if you have a resource on it that would be great, because then I can write a proper definition of the term! [[User:StineEliseJ|StineEliseJ]] ([[User talk:StineEliseJ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/StineEliseJ|contribs]]) 16:24, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi! Maybe we should write a little (and I mean just a word or a very short sentence) about who the different people actually are? (Marshall McLuhan, Jaron Lanier etc.) From what I have read on Wikipedia, I think it may be smart to just say who they are and why they are mentioned in this particular text. Or what do you guys think? [[User:StineEliseJ|StineEliseJ]] ([[User talk:StineEliseJ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/StineEliseJ|contribs]]) 16:49, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Elise, there's a definition for technological determinism in the book &quot;New Media&quot; which is the first book listed on the resource list for FMS9A4. If you search the document you will find it in the glossary (pp. 429). Also,I think that's a great idea. We were talking about linking the theorist to their wiki pages. So, for example, Jaron Lanier's name would be a hyper link to his Wikipedia page. What do you think? [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 21:51, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma, thanks, I will look at it. And linking the theorists to their wiki pages is a great idea! But does anyone know how to actually link the pages together? [[User:StineEliseJ|StineEliseJ]] ([[User talk:StineEliseJ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/StineEliseJ|contribs]]) 11:09, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Elise, I've tried it above if you want to have a look and see if this is okay? [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 12:15, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma and Elise. I've been trying to do this but failing miserably (Gemma, you should work for Wiki!) so I asked a Wikipedian and what he said follows right after this - so I don't know if we should be doing it now. My instinct tells me it makes sense though - what do you guys think? &quot;Hi George Berrie.Because this is Wikibooks, if you write an ordinary wikilink, it only links to a page with that name on Wikibooks. If you write markup [[Reykjavík]], you get a redlink, Reykjavík, because there isn't a book called that.Books are relatively self-contained; that's part of what makes them books. So we don't link all that often to other wikimedia projects, such as Wikipedia. There's a prefix for each of the sister projects, that can be used to create links to them; but sister links within a book are relatively few, and are typically set aside from the text, such as in a box on the right or in a list at the bottom of a page. Here's a link to a Wikipedia page: Reykjavík. --Pi zero (discuss • contribs) 01:45, 1 April 2014 (UTC)&quot; [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 18:48, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi there, better to just go with the APA style set out in the media guidelines? I think that is what we are doing, better to be safe! [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:29, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma - yes I think we should make the links you mention. I say this because I've had a look at one of the Wiki help pages and there is stuff about exactly what a Wikibook is - it is really good - and there is plenty of mention of making links to other pages/other websites/Wikipedia. Here is a link to it ... https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Announcing/About_this_book I'm going to make some of these links myself now - well I'll try! Are you going to transfer stuff over to the main book soon? I was going to do it tonight but I think I'll wait until I get these links in.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 19:27, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Gemma - re references - sorry I missed this - I'll go in and edit this...[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 19:30, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey! Just trying to send all the Always-On people a message about the boyd section. In the discussion page it has been decided that we will write her name in lower case throughout the wiki page, so that it remains consistent and coincides with her actual wikipedia page. Thanks!

Hi Gemma! Have you moved your information to the main page yet? [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 20:51, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey AJ, not yet. Have you? I'm waiting to tidy a few things up first. I might post it tomorrow. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 21:07, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma! I've moved my stuff across to the main book now and followed the heading/subheading format that was there - relatively straight forward. However, I can't see the place on the book where you go in and sign with three tilds to show that you have made an entry - any idea where it is?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 09:42, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma, I've now moved all my stuff onto the main page and tried to edit some information together.  Your discussion page is looking good, I like how you included pictures, we should maybe incorporate that into the main page.  Could you perhaps tell me how to do that so I could use it to put an image of Sherry Turkle on the main page?

Hejka! Just to let you know that I have added first points about the psychological aspect of 'always-on'. ([[User:Ania-polish accent|Ania-polish accent]] ([[User talk:Ania-polish accent|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ania-polish accent|contribs]]) 13:13, 2 April 2014 (UTC))

Gemma - thanks for info re three tilds etc - done it now and will let Aj know as I know she's put her stuff on too.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 15:16, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

No problem, that's me just added my information from my discussion page to the main page minus the references. Will double check they are not already listed then add more. How is everyone getting on?

Hey, I'm doing okay, just about to do some referencing, did you use footnotes or not? I'm slightly confused if I am to use them or not.  How are you getting on? [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 20:29, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey, I have no idea what to do re footnotes. We would need to label each one to a number but that would entail going through every other reference on the page. Some of the footnotes already applied from other groups don't work so I don't know how difficult it would be to do so.

== Discussion/Always on ==

Hi there, I noticed you have gone into technological determinism and our group hasn't looked at that. I am writing about Sherry Tuckle right now and I think a lot of her work is influenced by technological determinism? I am wondering if you would take a look at my page and see if you think I could link in any thing about Technological determinism. I think it links anyway but I am not 100% sure. Good work so far [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 12:01, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Gemma I think you are right about being at the meeting. I'll reply to the email you sent to the team - is there a time you could make it on Monday? Or could we grab 15/30 mins on Tuesday right after the seminar and tackle it then? Ania would be there then too.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 18:54, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Laura! I see you are querying referencing ... this is what a member of our team found ... basically Wiki has no referencing standard - all they ask is that you are consistent ... we've decided therefore to use APA style as that is the style for the module ... hope this helps!https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:21, 2 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

Hi again,
I was just reading over your stuff on the wiki- first of all: good work! Then I'd recommend you to adjust your referencing a little, changing it from the &quot;essay style&quot; intext citation to footnotes, like you started doing it in the draft below. Just something I've noticed, I might be wrong here... [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 15:02, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

== YouTube and Vlogging ==

YouTube is a public video sharing site created in 2005. People of all ages, races and genders use YouTube as a way of forming an online identity. Among entertaining home video clips, and amateur short films, Video Blogging (Vlogging) is one of YouTube’s most popular trends, as it provides a medium to create a publically accessible performance of “the real me”. Hobsbawn sees the current age as defined by a “hunger for a secure identity” (Strangelove)&lt;ref name=&quot;Strangelove&quot;/&gt;. This then highlights the obvious attraction of Vlogging, as a way for any person with a video camera and an internet connection to document their identity and present it for the world to see. Vlogging is one of the rawest forms of media as it is simply people sharing their feelings and experiences with the world, and as Van Koten states while discussing McLuhan’s theories concerning hot and cold media “…when we peel away the layers of media we ultimately end up with human experience”.  (Van Koten) This closeness to human experience and supposed honesty that people put across in Video Blogs (Vlogs) encourages others to use this medium and share their own feeling and experiences in order to feel like an individual within a community.  Mendelson and Papacharissi discuss how Carey (1975) “emphasised a ritual view of communication which helps foster community integration through the sharing of common experiences and values” (Mendelson &amp; Papacharissi). It is true that YouTube is seen as a community and safe place to share these feelings and experiences and the users of YouTube are regularly referred to as the “YouTube Community”. But why do people use this public video forum to share these inner most confessions rather than keeping a physical diary or having real life conversations. Sherry Turkle states in her TED Talks “Connected, but alone?” that “the feeling that ‘no one is listening to me’ makes us want to send time with machines that seem to care about us” (Turkle). YouTube provides an instant audience of listeners for any user, millions of people can access a Vlog at any one time, the community of an instant audience must surely play a key factor in why people choose to share their life experiences via Vlogs as opposed though real life social interaction. However, Turkle also states that through her research she has discovered that many feel that a feeling or experience is not valid until it is shared through the internet, usually via some form of SNS “I share therefore  I am” (Turkle). So, by sharing these personal/confessional videos on YouTube, not only do users receive and instant audience to listen to their feelings as they try to work out their own identity, but they also gain validations of those feelings through the process of sharing. The idea of being part of a community which also validates ones inner most feelings must surely be an appealing one for many, hence the popularity of Vlogs on YouTube. However, the identities presented on YouTube are not necessarily exact representations of how those users behave in their real world lives. Michael Strangelove in his book “Watching YouTube: extraordinary videos by ordinary people” discusses how “There are hundreds of videos online title ‘the real me’ that explore the difference between videographers on-screen persona and their ‘real’ self.” He goes on to give an example of a video made by college student Kevin Wu with the above title, Kevin explains how he is a different person from his videos, “You don’t know me…you don’t really know someone through the internet” (Strangelove). The construction of an ideal persona on SNS is seen across all mediums; YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr etc. When discussing the formulation of college students photos galleries on Facebook Mendelson and Papacharissi state that we “consciously and unconsciously transform ourselves before the camera, portraying a version of ourselves we wish to be” (Mendelson &amp; Papacharissi). So, while people wish to feel that their feeling are validated and they as themselves are accepted as part of a community, the common case is still that they present an ideal version of themselves and push that forward to be accepted as their true identity, whether is accurately reflects their real world persona or not.

=Sherry Turkle=

== About ==

Sherry Turkle is an American theorist and a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the area of social studies.  Many of her ideas in her books revolve around the culture and trends in technology.  Her book &quot;Alone Together&quot; mentions the idea of &quot;Always-on Culture&quot; and the relationship between people and technology and the consequences that can have.

== Turkle's Ideas ==

Much of Turkle's work focuses on the idea of &quot;Always-on Culture,&quot; the idea that collectively, people are always connected through technology. The &quot;Tethered Self&quot; is a prominent part of her always-on study.   She often mentions in her work, the idea that being constantly connected affects the user and is resulting in attitude changes, such as the break down of communication and people feeling more comfortable to communicate through mobile technology such as texts or emails.   

== The Tethered Self ==

This idea concerns the way in which people are connected and have access to it a communication device, such as a smart phone.  She often discusses how people can always be reached through mobiles or emails and if the person cannot contact the users, then machines often represent them, such as voicemail.  Also,  how a growing number of people are connected to some sort of network, such as Facebook, and rarely disconnect from it.  From interviews she has conducted, she concludes that people, especially teenagers, feel at a loss without their mobile and without being connected.  She argues that people have become more reliant on their technologies and this has led to users checking their networks more for any notifications. For example, users checking their smart phones for notifications.  

== Changing Attitudes ==

Turkle expresses how she feels that attitudes of users of the technology is changing.  She often mentions how communication is breaking down due to the increasing use of technology to communicate.   Turkle also argues that the way technology is now being used is not just changing the way the users communicate to each other, but it is also changing the user as a person.  The need for attention is able to fulfilled by social media and the ability to message people from a device but this can also lead to users feeling more bored or alone in real life situations.  In a 2012 Ted Talk, she expresses how face-to-face communication is suffering due to the rise of online conversation and how even when people are in them presence of others they often want to be somewhere else, so they communicate online while in the company of others.  She gives the example of people texting and emailing from boardrooms and during meetings.  Overall, she expresses that the popularity of communicating online and the the decline of communicating in person hence creating a feeling of isolation for the user.

== The Second Self ==

The “Second Self” is Sherry Turkle's second published book.  Throughout, she refers to ideas of computers being more than a device and how it is an important part of the user’s life, physiologically and socially.&lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. (2005) “The Second Self Twentieth Anniversary Edition.” Massachusetts: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; Her book is based upon opinions and attitudes of people who use computers and how that effects on their lives. &lt;ref&gt;NY Times. (1984) “The Second Self.” Retrieved 04/01, 2014, from http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/03/specials/turkle-second.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Written in 1984, before today's technology was invented and before most people owned a smart phone,  Turkle expresses ideas that could lead to today's &quot;Always On&quot; Culture such as the fear people initially had about becoming &quot;addicted&quot; to technology.&lt;ref name= ‘Turkle’&gt;Turkle, S. (2005) “The Second Self Twentieth Anniversary Edition.” Massachusetts: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Turkle also mentions ideas, similar to theorist Marshall McLuhan, of technology extending the self but she also adds how it extends the “external” world for the user.&lt;ref name= ‘NY Times’&gt;NY Times. (1984) “The Second Self.” Retrieved 04/01, 2014, from http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/03/specials/turkle-second.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
She states in the book, the idea that technology “changes not only in what we do but how we think” which is similar to her ideas in “Alone Together.”  This idea is emphasised in her later work as by then more technology had been developed and consumed. &lt;ref name= ‘Turkle’&gt;Turkle, S.

= Leslie Perlow = 

== About ==

Leslie Perlow is a professor of Leadership in the Organizational Behaviour area at Harvard Business School.  Most of her research focuses on being Always-on in the work place.  In her latest publication, “Sleeping With Your Smartphone” she focuses on employees of businesses who feel the need to be always online and always be connected and she discusses how disconnecting can be the most powerful tool for them. 

== Sleeping With Your Smartphone ==

In her latest publication, “Sleeping With your Smartphone,” she surveys thousands of different businesspeople in different professions over how much they work and their smartphone habits.  Some of her questions included, how often they check their phone and how often they can disconnect from it.  
She argues that professionals feel pressure to be always on and they often feel that if they disconnect, others may still stay on and become more successful than them.  
Due to different time zones and needing to be contactable for clients and fellow colleagues, Parlow has argued that it leads to employees to change their timetable and reschedule their time to make sure that they are always connected and remain to be perceived as a good employee as constantly being on is often expected from high pressure jobs.    

== Disconnecting == 

Parlow experimented with a company, Boston Consulting Company, to see if their employees would be able to disconnect and if that could be achieved.  At 6:00pm each night, a different employee would be able to disconnect from their work network and other employees were able to deal with clients if need be.  
Most employees felt many benefits such as finding their work more satisfying.  They also felt that they regained more control over their work life.  
Parlow argues that when this approach is applied correctly, not being always-on can benefit not just the employee but the organisation as well. [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 22:17, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

* Great work AJ, You've spend a lot of time on putting this together. May I make the suggestion of citing the entry with numbers throughout the text to make it easier to see where you used your references? I'll have another look tomorrow to see what else I can add to this. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 00:15, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
* Thank you Gemma, that is a good idea, I was initially thinking of adding that but was unsure how to go about it.  I have suggested on George's discussion that we collectively work through the referencing before creating the Wikibook.

* This is fantastic Aj! It gives us something to discuss and agree re references when we meet next week. Should we try and find other theorists who might have a different point of view so that we can create an argument? [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:05, 25 March 2014 (UTC)

= Meeting =

Hi AJ, I would to say that I looking forward to our meeting about the wiki book, even though you arranged it for straight after this class [[User:Kellymcdonach|Kellymcdonach]] ([[User talk:Kellymcdonach|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kellymcdonach|contribs]]) 15:54, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Aj - hope you get this as my Wiki skills are as basic as they come - hope to see you and the rest of the team at 4.30pm in the 24 hour zone. Maybe we could talk about this ...

AJ, did you get my email about not being able to make it on Monday 7th to arrange the presentation as I have another meeting at the same time? Do you know if we can reschedule as I feel I need to be there in order to put together the slides effectively.

= Discussion = 

Hey Hollie here, I am doing 'Always on' culture, in Group X, I am actually writing aout Turkle too and during my research have found some other things that I thought were quite important. The second self/Life on the screen/Alone together, will you be mentioning any of these, do you think they are relevant? I think they are relevant but don't want to go too off track and get off topic. I am sure I could link them in but I was wondering if you were planning on looking into them at all? [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 15:17, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Amanda, I think you have a lot of good information about Turkle but I think it would be interesting to add something about the validation that being 'always on' gives. I was going to contribute some info to that section. --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 16:30, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Aj - yes I was thinking the same - re adding our stuff today. I'm going to cut and paste it tonight - not sure how I'll strip out the contribs for this - so long as they remain on the discussion page that's the main thing I think. Are you transferring stuff over soon too?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 17:41, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Just been checking out other books - some have included a Glossary - which I think we should do because it is in the main book - and some haven't. And those who have are using different styles. The one for Always on looks good I think. Do you think we should just add to the main book as far as the Glossary goes and stick with the format that is there, or start ours from scratch? For what its worth, I think we should just add to what is there, adding only new stuff based on our own content. What do you think? [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 18:33, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey! Just trying to send all the Always-On people a message about the boyd section. In the discussion page it has been decided that we will write her name in lower case throughout the wiki page, so that it remains consistent and coincides with her actual wikipedia page. Thanks!

Hey Aj! I've moved my stuff across to the main book now and followed the heading/subheading format that was there - it was relatively straight forward and I edited out the contribs stuff when I was in edit mode on the page. However, I can't see the place on the book where you go in and sign with three tilds to show that you have made an entry - any idea where it is? Have you moved your stuff across now?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 09:45, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

This looks good, i will add what I have in with what you have, over all we will have loads. I have done a couple of her other main concepts and link them in with always on culture but nothing too much. What you have is great though. [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 11:31, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Aj - Gemma has cracked the problem of the 3 tilds on the main book - you just go to the main page and a list of contributors is at the bottom - you just have to go down and edit it and put your 3 tilds in there. Incidentally, I see some other groups have got a List of Contributors at the bottom of their page too - seems like a good idea for ours - what do you think?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 15:20, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi AJ, you go to [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikimedia Commons] and search for the image you'd like. Once you have the file name for it, you insert it onto your page alongside the specified code. Once you have done that, there is a tutorial on how to change the position and size [[Using_Wikibooks/Inserting_Images|here]]. It took me a long time playing about with it to get the images to the right size, but it's just trial and error. Hope this helps! Any questions, just message me!

We all post on the discussion page of that, like I am posting on your discussion page now.

'''RE Anonymity''' I will crack on with what I'm working on, and if there's anything you feel can be improved or would like to add you can go ahead and let me know you're going to edit and make the slight alterations you feel necessary - it is a group project afterall! All for one and one for all! [[User:Kriscampbell91|Kriscampbell91]] ([[User talk:Kriscampbell91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kriscampbell91|contribs]]) 14:42, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Anonymity''' I think the online cue of anonymity feeds into various topics [such as disembodiment, disinhibition effect, trolling, self-disclosure etc] It can be approached as an umbrella heading for all of these sub topics, or these topics can be addressed separately with a thematic thread of anonymity running through them. I'm not sure what seems best - do you think an umbrella heading of &quot;anonymity&quot; would suffice as a section? It seems more of a condition of the online realm [an aversion of the accountable body in real life] rather than a topic all by itself.... That being said I am currently reading some texts which state the anonymity factor can be used to produce honest self-disclosure and allow the lonely and anxious to express themselves honestly on the online realm. So not all negative! Thoughts?  [[User:Kriscampbell91|Kriscampbell91]] ([[User talk:Kriscampbell91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kriscampbell91|contribs]]) 14:11, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi, I'm Gemma from the Megabytes, we've not heard back from other groups yet but were just wondering what referencing style your group were intending to use. Wiki states that they have no set referencing style yet they like users to keep it consistent (See here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf). Our group thought it would be easier just to stick with APA as that is the set referencing style for Media modules. What do you guys think? Look forward to hearing from you.

== Discussion ==

Just going to copy and paste some of the major points we have been discussing on other platforms to keep you in the loop with what is going on as I know you don't have access to the conversation. We looked over things that other groups may have addressed and what we could address:
Main Concepts
Theorists/Speakers (Boyd, Turkle- their main concepts)
Definitions
Getting connected/different meanings
Examples of &quot;Always On&quot; Culture e.g., Text/Email/SNS/Web Pages/TV Red Button/Blu-ray Live
References
Glossary

I know Siobhan wants to touch up on danah boyd and add stuff on the page to that.  We've also been talking about how to add links to other pages which I wasn't quite sure of myself but I know Siobhan knows how to do it so you could go on her page and ask about that if you are looking to link something.

I think Jennifer is looking at examples of tv and its interactivity. 

Hope this keeps you up to date and is everything you need to know. not sure what you want to cover but I think we are now at the stage where we are all adding in stuff that we think is missing or what also need to be put in.

I meant to add that I am looking at Shirley Turkle and her main concepts/always on/the second self/ life on the screen and Alone together and how these are all linked into the 'always on' and tethering cluture.

=Current Discussions=
Hey George, that also sounds good. We can bring it up at next weeks meeting to see how we can engage with the other groups and the best way to do so. Perhaps we could add to their own user discussion pages and see what differences they have/what they deemed as important? [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 14:12, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, wasn't really sure where to put this. Within my group I'll be looking at danah boyd, we're yet to properly assign roles to everyone though. Bouncing some ideas around sounds good though! 
[[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 19:36, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey George, it's Kathryn from 4KR. The work your group has done looks really great! As of yet, my group hasn't allocated certain topics for certain people so, as far as I'm aware, we will just be contributing to each subject if and where there is anything to add. [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 13:39, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi again. I was just wondering which referencing style your group used so that I can ensure that I use the same one. Thanks. [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 14:34, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Kathryn, we will be deciding on a final referencing style on Monday at our team meeting, once we know I will get back to you on that one. Have your group been adding to their discussion pages or to the Yearbook page? I'm kind of confused as to how it's going to work because people have already submitted work to it and a lot of the ideas will be roughly the same. Any thoughts from your group on this? [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 12:00, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, this is just a reminder that we are now going to use the APA style of referencing for now.  Gemma posted on your page already about the wikipedia referencing link, but here it is for convenience:  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 16:10, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, I'm part of the 4KR group also doing always on culture. The work your group has done looks great so far! Has all of the work come from your group or have you been communicating with the other group? We're just collecting the last of our information and getting ready to add our stuff tonight. 
[[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 13:40, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, should we begin adding our information to the main page today? [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 16:28, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, about what you said on my page regarding the hyper-links: do you reckon we should include hyper-links to the other topics which are mentioned on my discussion (On-line Identity and Cognitive Surplus)? This will provide navigation to other pages from the &quot;Always-On&quot; chapter emphasising their connections with the other chapters in the yearbook. Do you know what I mean? [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 19:07, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, forgot to say, could you please have a look at my discussion page and find the note I left on the &quot;References&quot; section? I would appreciate it if you could let me know which articles you referred to. Thanks [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 19:10, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, just got your message. Yes, I am going to add my content to the page now.  In terms of the glossary I think we should add new content that we have that is missed. [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 20:49, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey, I get what you mean with the others putting content straight on there. We've just started putting content straight onto the book now too since its getting nearer deadline day. We've got a sort of draft page on the discussion page of one of the girls in my group just now so we have a lot more stuff still to go on there. It's quite hard to tell who has posted what on the book unless you bother scrolling through all of the edit history too! I think this would've been a lot easier if Wiki was easier to navigate lol. [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 10:00, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey George, in reply to your comment on my discussion page, I have now moved all my content over to the main page but I am yet to edit it with the content that is already there.   Also, I don't know either were to put the three tides. [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 10:22, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey george, I seen your message on Siobhan's wall and I think it would be a good idea just to build a glossary together, so everyone add their own little bits and people can just add more of their own terms or anything people have missed instead of everyone individually writing a glossary as I am sure we all have a grasp on the main terms anyway I hope! [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 11:57, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hiya, in reply to your message, we sign the three tides under the &quot;List of Contributors&quot; title on the contents page of the Yearbook. I've done mine just now so hopefully people will be able to spot it easier. Here's a link: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Media_and_Culture_Yearbook_2014 
[[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 15:03, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks for the help George! Yeah, that sounds like a good idea! [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 16:02, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Tidying up references sounds good, once we have the glossary up and running we should definitely have that put in alphabetical order as well. [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 16:50, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Just to add on to what I just said, I just looked at the glossary that is already there, I have ordered it in alphabetical order but I do think it maybe needs some padding out. Or a bit more information. So definitely something the groups could be looking at tomorrow/closer to when it's finished [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:04, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Another thing to add on...I've been talking with Kelly another girl from another group and we have noticed that the references on our over all page are mixed and they should all be the same... i.e some are foot notes and some is APA. I know you have spent time looking at them so we wanted to get your opinion on changing it all to the same, we are swaying more towards foot noting and Kelly says she is happy to do, obviously we could help her. We are discussing this on the Talk page/Discussion page on the actual 'Always on' project page, so it would be good if you could get the general consensus from your group before we go ahead and footnote it all. [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 18:32, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey, did you manage to sign your name on the book? I'm not completely sure if we're thinking of the same thing here but Greg was saying in this weeks seminar that we can sign our name on the main page of the book under the list of contributors. I'm not sure if this is what you meant. [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 20:43, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, I'm (almost) done with the definitions, the only thing I need before posting it on the year book page is a name in one of the paragraphs that you posted on my discussion page. The name somehow got lost when I tried to do the in text referencing, and I can't seem to get back. I think it's supposed to be Lanier, but I can't really post it without knowing.

Hi guys! I am now finished, and I have posted my contributions on the main wikibook page! [[User:StineEliseJ|StineEliseJ]] ([[User talk:StineEliseJ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/StineEliseJ|contribs]]) 12:32, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi George Connor here, was wondering if you could now post your section on technological determinism on our book with the references. I think it would be best going under the section titled Marshall McLuhan-Extensions of the Human Body. Thanks [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 13:39, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, did you get my email about not being able to make it on Monday 7th to arrange the presentation as I have another meeting at the same time? Do you know if we can reschedule as I feel I need to be there in order to put together the slides effectively.

=Being 'On': the different means of getting connected=


Being ‘always on’ means taking into account both technical networks and social networks according to danah boyd. When we cannot connect to the technical network we can often feel frustrated, angry, or worried that we can’t get access to a particular piece of information, or that our productivity will fall, or we can’t make a particular social connection at that precise point in time (Boyd 2012). This section looks at the how the internet developed and the legacy issues from that development, the technical network today and how each part has advantages and disadvantages. 

==Origins of the Internet and its Legacy==

The internet’s origin began in the 1960s with a network created by Advanced Research Projects Agency which was part of the US Defense department. It was called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET ARPANET] and was originally designed to connect universities and laboratories (IEEE, 2014). Many other networks were subsequently created in different organizations and  countries but the networks themselves could not effectively interconnect (BBC, 2012). In 1974 [http://research.google.com/pubs/author32412.html Vint Cerf]and [http://www.computerhistory.org/fellowawards/hall/bios/Robert,Kahn/ Robert Kahn]wrote communication protocols to enable information to be easily sent from one network to another and this was published in the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers magazine in May 1974. The protocols they wrote were called TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) and now form the protocols that run the internet (IEEE, 2014). Despite the clear benefits at the time of allowing the internet to flourish, TCP/IP might now be categorized as a ‘Lock-in’ as described by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier Jaron Lanier] (Lanier, 2011), and we are now somewhat constrained by a major tool we use to understand the world.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 14:54, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

==The Wireless Network: 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi==
There are a number of ways that we get 'on' the internet and it can often be a combination of wired and wireless methods. This section looks at wireless connections and some of the advantages and disadvantages.

===[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G 3G] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G 4G]===

3G and 4G are short for 3rd Generation and 4th Generation Technology. These developments have allowed for an increase in the speed of communication but also gave the user the addition of video calling, live streaming, mobile internet access and IPTV as the 3G/4G spectrum provides the necessary bandwidth to allow this: 3G technology is specifically designed to cater for multimedia communication (Engineersgarage.com). This advancement of generations means we have better and faster access to visuals, graphics and animation that would have appeared less sophisticated previously (about.com, 2014). [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 12:24, 29 March 2014 (UTC)


3G speed can provide up to 2 Megabits per second whereas 4G's speed of up 200 Megabits per second (Ibrahim, 2002) is significantly faster and is able [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 17:03, 31 March 2014 (UTC) to provide much faster speeds for High definition video streaming than 3G and Wi-Fi (about.com, 2014). [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 12:24, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

4G is now widely available and has an expanded coverage in comparison to 3G, so provides more or less constant connectivity. Although, it is still not available in many locations of the globe and is still a new generation so users may experience glitches and bugs with the technology (about.com, 2014). [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 12:24, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

===Wi-Fi===

Wi-Fi is wireless technology that uses microwave radiation to transmit and receive signals between devices and because of its method of transmitting and receiving it is thus vulnerable to interference (Clout, 2014). The existing wireless standard is 802.11n and is only capable of 150 Megabits per second. In addition, the greater the number of users accessing a wireless access point at a given time, the greater is the degradation of service experienced by those users (Clout, 2014).

However the need for greater speed when multiple users are using Wi-Fi has led to a new much faster Wi-Fi standard being developed: 802.11ac. The 802.11ac Wi-Fi standard has the potential to transfer information at 7 Gigabits per second which is more that ten times faster than the current standard.  The new standard was approved in January, 2014 (IEEE, 2014) thus enabling new devices to be designed and manufactured. Whilst the new standard makes it comparable with wired Gigabit Ethernet it will still retain the problem of interference as radio waves struggle to get through dense building materials and the signal deteriorates over a fairly short distance. (Digital Trends, 2013).

Networks which use wireless technology are more difficult and expensive to secure compared with wired networks and are thus vulnerable to identity theft and unauthorized surveillance  (Clout, 2014).



•Advantages of using Wireless: 

-Wireless provides convenience and the ability to work anywhere.

-There are less/no cables so more people can connect to the one access point.

-Ability to use internet on phones and tablets, providing a cheaper alternative for browsing.


•Disadvantages of using Wireless:

-There is a limited signal range, so speed will decrease the further away you go from the access point. 

-Wireless provides low security as signals can be intercepted. 

-Signals can also be affected by other signals/radio waves/walls/other physical barriers. 

-Wireless connection is not as fast as wired networks.


•Wi-Fi VS. 3G/4G

-Wi-Fi has the advantage when it comes to raw speed.

-3G/4G give you increased mobility as they cover a wider area

-Having access to both Wi-Fi and 3G or 4G on smart phones gives the user a degree of resilience if one or the other is not available. Wi-Fi is dependent on wires delivering the internet to the wireless/wired router.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:27, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

[[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 14:54, 25 March 2014 (UTC)


==The Wired Network: Fibre Optic Cable and Gigabit Ethernet==
===Gigabit Ethernet===


Gigabit Ethernet is a multi-core cable in which the data transfer speed is 1000 Megabits per second and so is about four or five times faster than Wireless. It can run over 100 meters which is much farther than existing Wi-Fi (Digital Trends, 2013).

[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 15:49, 28 March 2014 (UTC)


•Advantages of using an Ethernet cable: 

-Cannot be intercepted down the wire.

-High connection speed/high bandwidth. 

-Long cables are relatively cheap.

-&quot;Plug and play&quot; aspect

[[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 14:54, 25 March 2014 (UTC)

In terms of improved social cues, high bandwidth matters: video-based communications are of 'high fidelity' in terms of the cues we transmit to others and compares with 'low fidelity' for text-based comms and a lack of interpersonal cues (Sproull, L. and Kiesler, S., 1986) . [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:28, 26 March 2014 (UTC)[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 20:30, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

===Fibre Optic Cable===
Instead of using metal wires to send signals, fibre optic cables work using thin, flexible strands of glass and pulses of light to send information (About.com, 2014). The current industry standard for fibre optic broadband is 10 Gigabits per second and is about 66 times faster than wireless (IEEE, 2014).

Fibre optic technology has none of the reliability problems faced by wireless technology. It is claimed that fibre is even more reliable than metal wire cables as information moves through fibre optic cables in a way that makes it less vulnerable to interference from other data traveling along the same fibre cable (Clout, 2014).

==Future Direction==
The advance towards true &quot;Always-on&quot; connectivity globally, and in particular wireless connectivity, has recently been the subject of intent from two of the world's largest technology companies: Google and Facebook[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 17:07, 1 April 2014 (UTC) On the 28/3/14, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg Mark Zuckerberg], CEO of Facebook, announced that he has plans to expand the boundaries of the internet to ensure every person in the globe has affordable, basic access to internet services. He expects to do so through the use of wireless drones, satellites and lasers, thus creating a fully &quot;Always-on&quot; world (Pimental, 2014). [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg Zuckerberg] provides competition for Google who intend to do the same with balloons and radio signals rather than drones and satellites (Simonite, 2014).

==DRAFT of our Always On project==

Team,

I've had a go at putting the main headings for our project - please feel free to hack this to bits and edit it as you please - its just a start. Within each heading I've used the module handbook wordings to keep us right so that we put the right material in.

Also, I've tried to capture what we agreed at our first meeting - apologies if I have got any names wrong! I thought we could use this as a framework for our work. From the workshop I've got a note of some of the markup codes for headings and so on - but I'm sure they exist in a more comprehensive way some where on the wiki - let me know if you find them please! Ok, so here is the framework - as I say feel free to edit it as you think fit ...

===Introduction===
We should put in here a brief overview of the subject we are writing about
===Main Concepts===
In here we put the concepts associated with &quot;Always On&quot;, where the concepts came from - that's stuff like the theorists and what they had to say). Here are the concepts we thought we should have in our project:
====Theorists/Speakers====
This was allocated to Aj (Wiki name is amandajayner)  for Sherry Turkle and Ania (cool Wiki name is Ania-polish accent) for danah boyd

====Definitions====
This was allocated to Elise and was to include 'Disinhibition' (Wiki name is StineEliseJ)

====Engagement with other Groups researching &quot;Always On&quot;====
This was allocated to Gemma (Wiki name is GemmaMiller) 
====Getting &quot;On&quot;: the different means of getting &quot;connected&quot;====
This was allocated to George (Wiki name is George Berrie)
 
====Examples of &quot;Always On&quot; Culture e.g., Text/Email/SNS/Web Pages/TV Red Button/Blu-ray Live====
This was allocated to Kelly (Wiki name is Kellymcdonach)

Has anyone heard from Kelly as no contributions have been made by her yet? [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 11:57, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, see you at the social study with our media group later! [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 15:55, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey George, I hope at least someone in our group has a clue how to work this, because I'm lost. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 15:54, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi George, the topic that has been listed for me below is different to the one I thought I had. What do you mean by &quot;engagement with other groups&quot;, and do you reckon that is a title? What would this entail? I've discussed other topics which relate to &quot;Always-on&quot;, not collaborated with other seminar groups. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 13:25, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Gemma, I thought that you were going to engage with the other groups doing 'always on' to see if we could share stuff - but I've probably picked it up wrong because the stuff you've done already looks spot on! Maybe we should all just ask the other teams what they are doing when the time is right? 'Group X' and '4KR' also doing 'Always on'. Should we bring this up at next Monday's meeting?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:11, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey George, in terms of glossary it looks like people are just adding things to it as they crop up. That's probably the best way to go about it so everyone can check what is already there before adding more. I think that way there won't be any repeats, and just one person won't be doing work that has already been done [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 19:40, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey! Just trying to send all the Always-On people a message about the boyd section. In the discussion page it has been decided that we will write her name in lower case throughout the wiki page, so that it remains consistent and coincides with her actual wikipedia page. Thanks! [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 19:52, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hejka! Just to let you know that I have added first points about the psychological aspect of 'always-on'.([[User:Ania-polish accent|Ania-polish accent]] ([[User talk:Ania-polish accent|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ania-polish accent|contribs]]) 13:10, 2 April 2014 (UTC))

==Things to Discuss at our Meeting on 31st March (1pm - 2pm in the Library)==
1. Should we all individually contact members of Group X and 4KR (who are also doing 'Always On'), or nominate one of our team to do this. [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:18, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

2. The organisation of our page we are making and what information to use

3. Check over referencing and make sure that it is consistent [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 11:07, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

(Guys, this page might be of use to us regarding references as we need to use code when doing so. We can refer to this at the meeting: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf) [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 14:00, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

4. Discuss whether we have covered all main concepts, and if not, delegate topics to group. 

5. Discuss everyone's contributions and whether certain topics need more work/content added [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 14:16, 25 March 2014 (UTC)

6. When to start posting things on the &quot;Always-On&quot; Chapter in the Yearbook. Some groups have already started doing so. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 14:16, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

7. Maybe we can look also at the psychological damage that 'Always-On' can do to some people? Here is an example article: http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/micwright/100009425/the-always-on-culture-smartphones-stress-and-suicide/ ([[User:Ania-polish accent|Ania-polish accent]] ([[User talk:Ania-polish accent|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ania-polish accent|contribs]]) 20:14, 30 March 2014 (UTC))</text>

Hi Kris, thanks for answering my question. I think you are right, I just wasn't sure. I think you could do an entire heading under anonymity rather than a subheading of something else, and then yourself or someone else in the discussion could make reference to how it could be used for negative distortion. Is that the sort of thing you were thinking? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 12:49, 27 March 2014 (UTC)


I have also been reading some positive aspects to anonymity  too, thus I think it should be an umbrella subheading (but that is the sort of thing I like). I will leave it down to you, but it seem like you have lots of good information to fill it. And if you do it one way and don't like it, you can always change it as we still have a week to complete this :)[[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 14:36, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Kris, it's at the very bottom of the discussion page on our online identity wiki, I made a new heading for Impression Management.

Hi there Andrew. Greg informed me that you're in our group for the wikibooks. Mostly we've kept our discussion [[User talk:Flailkerrin|here]] about everything, and there you'll also find all the members of our group. --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 10:30, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

&quot;Hi Ismay, glad to be a part of the team, I can't seem to find our discussion page, do you know where it is? Thanks!!&quot; (retrieved from Facebook) [[User:Thesmallerandrew|Thesmallerandrew]] ([[User talk:Thesmallerandrew|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thesmallerandrew|contribs]]) 21:25, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

All of below is copied from a Facebook chat:

March 22nd &quot;Hey! I'm your group for this wikibooks project, just wondering if we all have to meet up at all?&quot;

AmericanStephen: No, I don't think so. We were really just discussing everything that we were planning to do on Iain's discussion page but I see that you've already found that. At this point we're all just going through the various material for always on culture that has been in lectures and readings, and trying to make sense of it to put it on the actual page. I don't think we'd really discussed meeting at any time

&quot;Ahh cool cool, sounds good! Are we collaborating on one page or on our individual pages? Sorry, I've been out the loop from the internet for the last week, trying to catch up haha&quot;

&quot;Nah man it's all good. We're all working on the page linked through the wikibook for the whole class. I think the others may have made some contributions already: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Media_and_Culture_Yearbook_2014/%27%27%27Chapter_3:_Always-on_Culture%27%27%27

&quot;Ahh I see, thanks a lot man, life saver! I was about to go off on a complete tangent there haha&quot;

March 25th &quot;hi there is no link to our wikibooks page on the discussion page, have you got a link please?&quot;


&quot;Search for chapter 3: always on culture&quot;

&quot;right, so do we have our own topic we are writing about, or do we write about anything about &quot;always on culture&quot;?&quot;

&quot;Anything related to always-on culture, whether the lecture, reading, or outside research&quot;

&quot;brilliant thanksso we just add to whatever is still there?&quot;

&quot;Yes&quot;

&quot;thanks&quot;

Hi Kasia,

I know Caroline and Clare are in out group, but can you remember the name of the fifth member? (If the fifth member reads this please jump in.)

Elizabeth


Do you know how we can start a discussion with the remaining members of our group? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 17:07, 26 March 2014 (UTC)
 
I'm not too sure, the only way I can think of is by continuing discussions on the online identity page, but it seems that not everyone has got in touch with it yet. We couldn't always try Facebook as a last resort, and then maybe direct them to this page to discuss here?

Our usernames are: StineEliseJ (Elise); Kellymcdonach (Kelly); GemmaMiller (Gemma); Ania-polish accent (Ania); amandajayner (Aj) and George Berrie (that's me).

Hey there! As I went to post on the Reading Room page, I saw your post and thought I'd help you out if I could! I see you have a discussion page but no user page.

== Presentation Group X: 1st Meeting ==

The topic of our presentation shall be 'Always On' Culture on Tuesday 15th April during our seminar from 12:00-1:00. The first meeting for our presentation for the FMS9A4 Module on Digital Media &amp; Culture has been arranged. We shall meet outside the University library at 2:30 on Wednesday 9th April. We will meet again after this but will arrange something after our first meeting together. [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

Really looking forward to getting this going! If you look below you'll see I've drafted a rough lesson plan type thing that Group X can work from. Check it out and I look forward to hearing your opinions and suggestions. [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

== Group X Members ==

The members of the presentation Group X are as follows:

Charlotte Ryder(myself),
Hollie Irvine,
Siobhan Rathwell,
Jennifer Wylie,
Ciara Roe and 
Rachel Barr [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

== 'Always On' Culture Presentation Plan ==

Here is a very rough lesson plan for the seminar Group X will be presenting and conducting on the 15th April. It can be subject to change and is VERY vague but it's a starting point to get us thinking. If Group X members could add things/discuss ideas/put forward points/ask questions about our presentation here that would be great! 

1. Introduction - Short film (about 1 minute long) introducing ourselves and the topic.

2. Talk about main points of subject - Generate group discussion.

3. Activity for the class (potential for handouts and reference sheets).

4.Wikibooks Evaluation - How we put it together/What we choose to cover/What we found or learnt/Our opinion of the task.

5. Conclusion.

Like I've said it's a really vague lesson plan but it gives us something to work with. Let me know what you all think! [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

This sounds really good so far, we could make the activity really good and totally interesting. A wordsearch! no I am just kidding but sounds really good, glad you are so organized! [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:42, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

This seems cool so far! I think the main thing we need is a really awesome way to get the discussion going. If everyone starts thinking of ideas before we meet up. Do we want a presentation or have the film playing over in the background as we talk? Making controversial points would be good too.

Looks like you've got a pretty good idea of what the bones of our presentation could be, I'd be happy to follow that structure. I think Siobhan is right about everyone thinking of ideas before we meet up, that way we know everyone will make a contribution to the creative process and we'll be more likely to find a stimulating activity for the seminar if we pool our ideas.

'''If you are interested in any things I have talked about in the discussion for the online identity section of the wiki book then feel free to talk to me via my discussion page here. I would be more than happy to give you the names of researches that I am currently researching so that you can help me by editing particular topics or theorists on the actual wiki book itself.

== Answer to question at reading room (FROM: BIG BOYS=FUN) ==

Hi there, SmithBiancaAnn and welcome to Wikibooks! Thanks for asking you question at the reading room!

'''Question 1:''' 

''Why do some user names on WikiBook come up as red and say that the user does not exists and others are in blue? What does this mean?'' 

'''Answer 1:'''

Some names &amp; pages come up as red because of many reasons...a red link could mean they were deleted/blocked. Sometimes the red ones are red because the page hasn't been created yet. Like your user page. If you click &quot;edit&quot; on your user page, and enter your own text &amp; click save, it will not be in red anymore! It should be in blue. The blue ones are a link (click on them). The blue links means there's text on the page the link goes to.

'''Question 2:'''

''how do I get in contact with a person if I have their wiki name, how would I go about finding their personal wiki page?''

'''Answer 2:'''

Go to the &quot;search&quot; box in the right hand side of almost any WikiBooks page. Enter in a username (for example: BIG BOYS=FUN) of yours. Click &quot;search.&quot; The name should not pop up. Once you get the seach results click &quot;advanced&quot; an check the &quot;user talk&quot; box then scroll up a little and click &quot;search&quot; again. The username should be in the search results below.

Again, thanks for asking your questions at the reading room, [[User:BIG BOYS&amp;#61;FUN|☺☺Visit my user page☺☺]] ([[User talk:BIG BOYS&amp;#61;FUN|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BIG BOYS&amp;#61;FUN|contribs]]) 14:52, 18 October 2014 (UTC)

==Introduction==
Hi, I'm Jennifer and I'm a second year journalism student at the University of Stirling.

I am new to the Wiki community and learning as I go. I joined for the purposes of completing a class project but I am interested in contributing more to Wikipedia and Wikibooks in the future.

I write for Brig, Stirling's student newspaper. My other interests include blogging, volunteering, swimming and learning languages.

== Definitions ==

=== Always-on ===
The term &quot;always-on&quot; is used to refer to the way modern technology (mobile phones, computers etc.) continuously keep people connected to each other through the internet, and therefore always accessible. Sherry Turkle suggest that people have become so tethered with their &quot;always-on&quot; communication devices that the self has become attached to its devices and that life now has become both physical and digital lives on multiple screens: the devices are always ready in hand&lt;ref&gt;Katz, J. E. (2008). Handbook of mobile communication studies. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press. Sherry Turkle, &quot;Always-on/Always-on-you: The thedered Self&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;.

Others, such as Danah Boyd, look at this from a positive perspective, she says that the online world is always just around the corner, and that the online world does not necessarily have to be a bad thing. Boyd also say that most people are &quot;always-on&quot; without technology being the center of the activity; &quot;there is no longer about on or off. It's about living in a world where being networked to people and information wherever and whenever you need it is just assumed&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mandiberg, M. (2012). The social media reader. New York: New York University Press. Danah Boyd, pp.71--76&lt;/ref&gt;. If people in some way are connected to the network, through a mobile phone, a computer, gaming console etc., they are considered to be &quot;always-on&quot;.

While Boyd seems to make a relevant point that our online lives are as ‘real’ as our offline lives, more could be said about the significant difference between these two aspects of our lives, in particular how we behave online versus how we behave offline. Suler makes the point that when we communicate online, our input comes after some delay, perhaps minutes or hours or days, and this affects what we say, in text form, and how we say it&lt;ref&gt;Suler, J. (2005). The online disinhibition effect. International Journal Of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, 2 (2), pp. 184--188&lt;/ref&gt;. Importantly, he asserts that when we communicate face-to-face with others, “moment-by-moment responses between people powerfully shapes the ongoing flow of self-disclosure, usually in the direction of conforming to social norms”&lt;ref&gt;Suler, J. (2005). The online disinhibition effect. International Journal Of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, 2 (2), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;. If this is the case, if an increasing amount of our time is spent online this could perhaps leave some people struggling with face-to-face social skills necessary to fit into a particular environment, such as that of an organisation with a clear expectations of cultural behaviour, or to succeed in particular roles where face-to-face interaction with people is necessary. ( [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:51, 27 March 2014 (UTC) )

=== Disinhibition ===
The term &quot;disinhibition&quot;, or &quot;the disinhibition effect&quot;, has been defined, after years of research on psychology and the Internet, as a recognition of people behaving differently online, than they would in offline situations (real life situations). Examples of this type of behaviour is a person who outrageously flirt online, while acting completely opposite when offline&lt;ref&gt;Gackenbach, J. (2007). Psychology and the internet. Amsterdam: Elsevier/Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;. The fact that people cannot see or hear each other when online can be enough to trigger the disinhibition effect&lt;ref&gt;Suler, J. (2005). The online disinhibition effect. International Journal Of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, 2 (2), pp. 184--188&lt;/ref&gt;. Offline communications allows people to see facial expressions such as frowns, shaking hands and many other subtle signs to tell if a person is disapproving, which inhibits what people now are willing to express. ( [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:32, 27 March 2014 (UTC) )

Disinhibition can be split into two opposing directions, benign disinhibition and toxic disinhibition. When people show fear, reveal secret emotions, wishes, and in general share personal things about themselves it can be defined as benign disinhibition. It also suggest that people show unusual acts of generosity and kindness, and can go out of their way to help others. When people act in the opposite way, being rude, give harsh criticism, show anger and hatred and even threats, it can be defined as toxic disinhibition. This means that people visit the dark underworld of the Internet, places they would never explore in the real world, such as pornography, crime and violence-territory&lt;ref&gt;Suler, J. (2004). The online disinhibition effect. Cyberpsychology \&amp; Behavior, 7 (3), pp. 321--326.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Dininhibition has also been defined as people expressing themselves in a way they cannot when offline. They behave in a certain way that expresses what can be defined as the &quot;real me&quot;. The &quot;real me&quot; is not filtered, censored or fabricated and acted - following several dynamic reasons such as social norms and sanctions, shame and guilt. When offline, these people might feel trapped, and once online they feel freer to be closer to their basic personality structure and actualize psychological needs, which can only be done in cyberspace where they can stay anonymous if wanted.&lt;ref&gt;Barak, A. (2008). Psychological aspects of cyberspace. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Low Fidelity/High Fidelity===
Examples of &quot;Low fidelity&quot; communications are ones which are solely text-based or voice-based. Low fidelity is characterised by the lack of interpersonal and social context cues which determine how an individual feels or expresses their opinion. For example, text-based communications can lose the intended meaning depending on how the receiver interprets it. Different emphasis on certain words can change the importance significantly. Voice-based communications are of a slightly higher fidelity, but they lack facial expressions which are a clear indicator of one's position on a matter&lt;ref&gt;Sproull, L. &amp; Kiesler, S. (1986). Reducing social context cues: Electronic mail in organizational communication. Management Science, 32 (11), pp. 1492--1512&lt;/ref&gt;.

Communicating with strangers without face-to-face cues also may lead to the reader subconsciously creating a voice and/or visual image for the other person conducted from their own imagination. This, in turn, will create a different version of the person which the user is communicating with based on his/hers individual desires and needs. Thus, the &quot;reality&quot; of these types of conversations may be distorted and develop into a fantasy face-to-face conversation, imagined by the reader, where the stranger fits into a specific role which the reader requires&lt;ref&gt;Suler, J. (2005). The online disinhibition effect. International Journal Of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies, 2 (2), pp. 184--188.&lt;/ref&gt;. ( [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 13:53, 28 March 2014 (UTC) )

Video based communications give you both voice and facial recognition aspects but they provide a different atmosphere than from when you are in the same room as another human being. For example, content and micro facial expressions can be lost through a drop in signal or a low quality webcam.

===Locked In===
Locked in is the idea that some software and ideas are used so much that they become industry standard and are accepted by most people to the extent that they are nearly impossible to change. Lanier often uses the example of MIDI, a system which was created in the early 1980's. This system concerns musical notes and it transfers them from electronic instruments to computers. Lanier argues that this system is not the best and has limitations; however, as many new and different programmes have been created and adapted to be able to use it, it means that MIDI is still currently used. Another example is the QWERTY keyboard. This layout of keyboard became popular and frequently used in type writers. As most people know how to type using this sort of keyboard and are familiar with this layout, using another one would most likely not be successful with people, meaning that the QWERTY keyboard remains used&lt;ref&gt;Fish, A. (2011). Book review: Jaron Lanier, You Are Not a Gadget: A Manifesto. New York: Alfred Knopf, 2010. New Media \&amp; Society, 13 (3), pp. 510--513&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Determinism===
====Technological Determinism====
Technological determinism, also known as hard determinism, is the idea that technology has important effects on our lives. It argues that technology drives history and becomes determinant at a certain stage in history. This idea figures prominently in the popular imagination and political rhetoric&lt;ref&gt;Lister, M., Dovey, J., Giddings, S., Grant, I. &amp; Kelly, K. (2008). New Media: A Critical Introduction. 2nd ed. London: Taylor And Francis&lt;/ref&gt;.
( [[User:Ania-polish accent|Ania-polish accent]] ([[User talk:Ania-polish accent|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ania-polish accent|contribs]]) 22:35, 1 April 2014 (UTC) )

====Cultural Determinism====
Cultural determinism, also known as soft determinism, is the idea that technology in itself do not have an important effect in peoples life, but people make technology important. Meaning that human agents intend to make technology an important part of their life&lt;ref&gt; Lister, M., Dovey, J., Giddings, S., Grant, I. &amp; Kelly, K. (2008). New Media: A Critical Introduction. 2nd ed. London: Taylor And Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;.

* Hey! After today's meeting, we decided to use the APA style of referencing to keep consistency, there is examples of it and details in the module handbook. Also, Gemma found a good link for referencing on wikibooks which is: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 16:17, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

* Hi Elise. Just been checking out other books - some have included a Glossary - which I think we should do because it is in the main book - and some haven't. And those who have are using different styles. The one for Always on looks good I think. Do you think we should just add to the main book as far as the Glossary goes and stick with the format that is there, or start ours from scratch? For what its worth, I think we should just add to what is there, adding only new stuff based on our own content. What do you think?

* Hi George. Glossary sounds like a good idea. I think we should just add to what is already there. Should I just read everyone's discussion pages and find different words to put in the glossary, or should you send me the glossaries that you guys find most important in conjunction with each topic?

* Hejka! Just to let you know that I have added first points about the psychological aspect of 'always-on'([[User:Ania-polish accent|Ania-polish accent]] ([[User talk:Ania-polish accent|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ania-polish accent|contribs]]) 13:14, 2 April 2014 (UTC))

* Hi Elise - re the Glossaries I think your first idea is best - that is just read everyone's discussion pages and find different words to put in the glossary. Are you going to just go straight to our main page to do this - that would save time. If you do that, you could edit the main book at the bottom, where its says &quot;contributors&quot; and add your name there too.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 16:24, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

*Hi Elise, did you get my email about not being able to make it on Monday 7th to arrange the presentation as I have another meeting at the same time? Do you know if we can reschedule as I feel I need to be there in order to put together the slides effectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve">My name's Ismay; hello-and-welcome to my user page-type-thing.

I enjoy an abundance of dashes and generally making an amusing nuisance out of myself.

I'm the resident cool-kid with my love of films, games, comics, and too much television for one human being to safely consume.

Hey Kelly, I saw on the main discussion page that you are writing about Sherry Turkle.  I have researched into some of her ideas (it's on my discussion page) which I will add to the main page later.  Is there anything you can see from my information that I have missed?

Hi Kelly, Good idea! I will add the information I already have to the main book now and then after editing together with everyone else's information, then we can decide what other information to research and add.

Glad to see you take my interests as seriously as I do. If I had to pick a jumper it would probably be the one I am wearing as the mere fact I was wearing this one spurred me to put that down as an interest. I'm capricious like that.

Hey! Just trying to send all the Always-On people a message about the boyd section. In the discussion page it has been decided that we will write her name in lower case throughout the wiki page, so that it remains consistent and coincides with her actual wikipedia page. Thanks!

Hi there! I saw that you posted in the Crowdsourcing page last night about the text box. An easy way to get that is to indent (or place 5 spaces) to the left of every line, creating a space before like this:
     Writing this way
     Should help to define
     that you are writing
     A quote longer than three lines.
If its under three lines, it's totally fine in quotes. This will give you that fancy text box, and will separate the long quote from the rest of your writing. Hope I could be a little bit helpful!

Hey, I am part of the Digital Media course, just in a different seminar group, I left it incredibly late to join a group and Greg told me I could join one of the groups in your seminar. I was wondering if I could join yours, if that would be possible? Let me know.

I have no idea, I guess we can start asking some people, see who's group has the lowest members... if not, then Greg did mention earlier, that he might organise another session at the end of the semester for people who are in mixed seminars.

== Group: ==

There seems to be one other person in our seminar without a group, I was thinking of asking them, and we could either just work in a group of three, or maybe recruit someone from one of the other seminars to flesh out our group a bit. What do you think? Greg also said, we could just potentially join a group of five that already exists...

Hello Jennifer, I've put up a very very very very vague lesson plan type thing for our group presentation on my discussion page if you want to have a look at it before we meet next week. It's very simple and vague but it's a starting point to work from. Tell me what you think and I look forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas!

== Topics ==

Hey jennifer? What are you looking at for the project? issues that still need addressed or looked into from us are: definitions, introduction to the topic (basic outlines) a glossary... Main concepts and examples. Look at the page so fat there is some good stuff but we will need to add some more. [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:39, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Hollie, I've been working on some ideas about TV becoming more interactive and relying on social media/apps etc and thinking about adding something to The Network section about obsessiveness in fan culture eg. the effect of when fans always know where their idol is and/or if being constantly exposed and connected to something increases interest. [[User:Jenniferhw94|Jenniferhw94]] ([[User talk:Jenniferhw94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jenniferhw94|contribs]]) 20:19, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Think that is really good and that totally links in to 'Always on' and being tethered. The celebrities are 'Always on' so that we can know where they are and what they are doing all the times. So then we are 'Always on' because of them... so it is a vicious circle. This can also be linked into fan culture and this could be, in a way, linked into cognitive surplus and the questions of 'free labour or productive creativity'. If we are always on and celbrities are always on and we are part of a fun culture, especially online we are almost advertising for these celebrities. everytime we retweet or like what they are doing, is it free labour/advertisement or just our own personal doing? I am not sure if all this really links but in my head I am making sense of it. [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 13:02, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Definitely. Their careers can be improved by having an online presence as well. Maybe it would be a good idea to put something on the page about connections between always on and the other topics? A lot of this relates to online identity as well! [[User:Jenniferhw94|Jenniferhw94]] ([[User talk:Jenniferhw94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jenniferhw94|contribs]]) 15:12, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Me again, gentlemen. I've made a few contributions to the page (very impressed that another group has already made a wonderful start. I was looking for more information on the expectation for other people other than yourself to be 'always on'. I'm sure I read something somewhere which has a good few quotes and terms and so on that would be useful, but me being me, I've forgotten entirely where and what it was. Any helpers?
Also maybe we should start discussing other sub-topics we want to put into the main concepts. I divided the two you can see now, but this is a topic which could have a plethora of subcategories, but I don't know how far would just make it more scattered. --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 17:01, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

== I Got Confused As To Where Everything Is So Enjoy This New Group Discussion Topic! ==

.........does what it says on the tin. I'l reiterate that I'm keen to discuss today in class what needs to be done in the book because it's a bit cluttered as it stands. I'm spending the morning doing a bit of maintenance; minor edits such as capitalizing things and formatting properly. --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 09:24, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Right...I'm now able to give this more attention than purely doing reading!  Though of course the majority of main points are already there by now.  

Going through what is already there, I feel that although relevant, the whole sections about online dis-inhibition might be somewhat sidetracked or could be better linked specifically to Always On Culture.  This could just be me, let me know what you think.  I felt the Social Context Cues section was more effective, as it brings up irritation at lack of response without knowing the reason behind the delay.   
 
Another point is inconsistency in some of the format.  Some quotes are italicised, others not.  Some are in the main body of discussion, others are seperate.  I'll look up standard formatting for this and set about bringing it all into line. (finally a use for being pernickity as hell)
[[User:Flailkerrin|Flailkerrin]] ([[User talk:Flailkerrin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Flailkerrin|contribs]]) 22:33, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

&quot;For quotations, use only quotation marks (for short quotations) or block quoting (for long ones), not italics. (See Quotations below.) This means that (1) a quotation is not italicized inside quotation marks or a block quote just because it is a quotation, and (2) italics are no substitute for proper quotation formatting. One way to distinguish long block quotes from ordinary text is to use {{quotation}}, which will box the text. Citation links may not work within such templates; if so, it may be necessary to use {{quote}}.&quot;  This may be from wikipedia's manual of standards, but I feel it is what we should go by here too. [[User:Flailkerrin|Flailkerrin]] ([[User talk:Flailkerrin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Flailkerrin|contribs]]) 22:39, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Should've seen that one coming...there is actually a more extensive section on quoting.  I'll not do much more tonight as I am obviously far too tired to be doing this just now!

I need to stop talking to myself...but somebody else recently went through and italicised a bunch of quotes from what I can see...so most likely wouldn't appreciate me going in and reversing all of it.  I'll check back after pending changes have been confirmed.

Hey.....so since I was on last night, another 4000 or so words of content have exploded into existence.  Half of it looks to just be pasted in from wikipedia, descriptions of what ethernet cables are etc.  And I thought that some of the information on dis-inhibiton was irelevant.  I'm not really sure where to start with deleting any of it, especially as I have no doubt those that put it there will simply try to put it back if I do...thoughts? [[User:Flailkerrin|Flailkerrin]] ([[User talk:Flailkerrin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Flailkerrin|contribs]]) 16:52, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Assuming that's coming from Iain. I think it needs to be marked for deletion - at least all of the 3g/4g/cables nonsense. It's all irrelevant and should not be on the article - ESPECIALLY if it's pasted in from Wikipedia. [[User:Americanstephen|Americanstephen]] ([[User talk:Americanstephen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Americanstephen|contribs]]) 16:36, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Iain - it was me who put the stuff on about wired &amp; wireless - and there were other contributions about this from our team too. It wasn't taken from Wikipedia - much of the source material was from the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. We felt that how one gets on the internet (and how it can be interrupted) was relevant to the topic of the culture of Always On. There are four groups working collaboratively on this topic and its fine to delete and move stuff - in fact that is the nature of building such a 
Wikibook - but a little discussion and civility (i.e. not being judgmental of other's comments) is also in the spirit of such a collaborative effort.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 17:19, 2 April 2014 (UTC) 

Aye sorry!  Chucked in my tildes now.  I agree, it's completely cluttering up the page and drawing attention away from the actual relevant info.  I haven't checked, and I don't think somebody would do something as ridiculous as paste it across, but either way, needs scrapping.  I'll be back on this evening and will have a go at it myself then if you haven't already!

what did george write about?[[User:Thesmallerandrew|Thesmallerandrew]] ([[User talk:Thesmallerandrew|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thesmallerandrew|contribs]]) 21:06, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Ah dear, seems I've enraged George.  Don't take it personally, I was being objective.  I agree there is a place for it, but as previously stated, my opinion is that links to the bulk of the information would suffice.  The cables that connect are relevant, but the inner workings of them not so much.  I would have happily debated this with you, the whole point of raising it there was so as others could respond!  There is no need for petty condescension or being precious about your contributions.  I stand by my original point, now more so than ever, what really needs done is refining what is there by trimming out unecesary content.  I am sorry you took offense to the blunt nature of my post, oh, and if you'd read all of the comments here before posting you might have spotted I had faith you wouldn't have got the info from wikipedia.

== Presentations ==

Alright peeps (loyal Magic Unicorns) when is everyone free to meet and discuss/dish out parts of the presentation to do? Days and times when you're free, albeit we do have almost 2 weeks, I think we'd all like some time to ourselves - to work on our speaking voices ;)  [[User:RobboAdare13|RobboAdare13]] ([[User talk:RobboAdare13|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RobboAdare13|contribs]]) 11:41, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Uhh...sorry to be the least helpful person ever, but I'm going to be pretty busy until I leave for America. Would you guys be awesome and let me know what we're doing at some point after y'all meet up? I'm still very much on board for the skype idea. I was thinking it would be cool to show all the ways you could get in touch with me in another country. Skype, Facebook, Twitter, email, snapchat, text (though dont text me because aint nobody got the money for that!) --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 10:14, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Honestly, pretty much any time would work for me. Maybe we could meet at the library sometime next week? Also smashing ideas Ismay, I think that should work fine. I think your participation (simply by skyping in to join us) will be more than enough participation from you.

==Always-On==

===Key Theorists===
danah boyd - I think I'll focus on the chapter given in the weekly reading by boyd, summing up her key ideas with references to them. I'll also look up some of her videos/talks online and see if they give a little extra insight to the topic and reference those in as well. After a quick search online it turns out she did another talk just a few days ago.
[[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 20:31, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

danah boyd is an academic researcher, focussing primarily on social media and how society interacts with it. Her work in The Social Media Reader (ref) highlights the problems that arise when defining the 'always- on' lifestyle and when being online begins and ends. boyd argues that different social contexts create different relationships with being always-on. This means that how society uses technology is not defined by space, but by the contexts we create. Continuing with this idea, boyd reasons that 'always-on-ers' are characterised by their values and lifestyle rather than generation. Therefore raising questions of who is involved in this always-on lifestyle according to their professional life and social activities, widely varying the spectrum. Furthermore, boyd supports the notion that technology provides a new area for understanding, curiosity, and interaction. This allows users to gain knowledge about people and information, and always-on-ers are taking full advantage of the possibilities available. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 13:56, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I've added this to the yearbook as well as an example written by boyd about Snapchat. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 14:34, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Oh, I'll do some background work on her too. Her books, talks etc and what key themes she is sharing [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 20:44, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Snapchat blog post showing an example of the effects of Always-On http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2014/03/21/snapchat-attention.html [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 19:43, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

If everyone can, try to keep the section on boyd in the year book as lower case for her name. That's what has been agreed on the discussion page so that's the best way to go about it [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 19:43, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Ubiquity and the 'network''''

One of boyd's main ideas is that technology and connectivity has become ubiquitous. This means that the technologies are being used as part of everyday life, and no longer thought of as simply technology. boyd refers to ubiquity in terms of how technology is becoming part of the social infrastructure, and supporting people in what they do. Furthermore, boyd is referring to the connectivity of technology and how it is a service for everyday people, not just technologists. This relates to Always-On Culture because as technology becomes more ubiquitous it is being used for more reasons in everyday life, and thus is a key component in being always-on.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.danah.org/papers/talks/Etech2007.html], boyd, d. (2007) Retrieved on 2nd April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Being surrounded by technology also links in with boyd's idea of what the 'network' truly means. boyd believes that the 'network' does not refer to the technology available, but rather to the idea that it offers a new platform to express pre-existing cultural ideas. Interaction and engagement are the driving forces behind information access and communication within the &quot;networked public&quot;. boyd argues that this formation of networks is primarily visible on SNSs and media-sharing websites. The purposes of these networks, according to boyd, are socialisation, consumption, and civic engagement. This links to Always-On Culture because socialising is being greatly influenced by technology and ease it offers in everyday life.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.danah.org/papers/essays/DigitalHandshakes.pdf], boyd, d. (2007) Retrieved on 2nd April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comments==

I think I would like to look at Sherry Tuckle... or were you wanting to do both theorists? [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 15:44, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Go ahead, I was just going to do both if it wasn't going to be covered [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 15:58, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi, I'm Gemma from the Megabytes, we've not heard back from other groups yet but were just wondering what referencing style your group were intending to use. Wiki states that they have no set referencing style yet they like users to keep it consistent (See here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf). Our group thought it would be easier just to stick with APA as that is the set referencing style for Media modules. What do you guys think? Look forward to hearing from you. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 15:23, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I think this is really good, I have nothing to add so far but I will go take a look at the year book and go over it to make sure it looks good there! Maybe putting in a reference here or there... or do you already have them? just to show where you got all your information from! well done on being so organised. I will start on Sherry Tuckle and see where that leads me in regards to other topics. [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:32, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Yupp, the references have been added on the main page. Hoping to find some more about it all though if I can [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 18:37, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I am not sure how to find out information/back ground information on Turkle just to add background knowledge without using wikipedia, any ideas? [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 18:43, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hollie, I don't suppose we could link to Turkle's own Wiki page could we? It would be a good link for people to check her work out in more detail without us paraphrasing or copying it out. I'm just not to sure how to do this... anyone have any ideas? Cheers! [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

I'm sure linking to her own Wiki page would be fine, plenty of other articles on Wiki do it. If she has her own website like boyd it will probably have it all there as well [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 18:57, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Sounds good, Linking to her wikipedia page but I am not sure I can use it as an ACTUAL reference, can you cite your own website if you know what I mean, do you think I will need to back up with outside sources too? [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 12:57, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

If you can find outside sources that'd be great, but you could always just link to the Wiki page rather referencing it if you can't find anything [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 13:24, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Siobhan. Just wondering if anyone in your team is looking at building a Glossary? I think we're meant to do that and I don't think we've tackled it in our group yet ... If everybody does it, it could mean a lot of duplicated work. On the other hand not everybody will have identical terms to put in the main glossary. Just wondered what you or your team thought?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 18:25, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hello guys, just in reference to the boyd name issue, just out of sheer interest does anyone know why she chooses not to capitalise her name? I just find the concept really interesting and wondered if people had any sort of knowledge on it maybe? [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

You might find this little post by her of interest http://www.danah.org/name.html. I think that clears up a lot about why she chooses to. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 19:34, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hej Siobhan I wrote Boyd's ideas about 'always-on' based on her piece of writing 'Participating in the always-on lifestyle'. Maybe you could add the bit about the addiction to media. She has quite interesting opinion about that. She doesn't think that people can be addicted to the technology. People love technology but only because it's a tool for communication. The truth is that people are passionate about people. Hope that help a bit.

==Group meeting==

So we're meeting on the 9th April, just thought we could put some things to discuss in here.


We'll need to cover;

who is researching what parts

how we want to present it (powerpoint etc)

who will make the presentation

what questions to open class discussion


Any other ideas? [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 19:55, 2 April 2014 (UTC)


I had an idea about putting together a little intro film to start the presentation of. I can pull together a sort of slideshow movie type thing on Windows Movie Maker with a bit of an overview of the topic, some pictures, open questions and references. I don't mind putting that together myself but getting your opinions and input would be great :) [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

That sounds cool! It might be a good place to put examples as well, just so we don't have to awkwardly try to explain them. If that makes sense? [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 19:30, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey, what exactly is it that we have to put in the presentation? Are we talking about our thoughts on putting together a wiki book, always on or both? I think the film thing is a good idea. [[User:Heyrach|Heyrach]] ([[User talk:Heyrach|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Heyrach|contribs]]) 16:13, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I think it's a bit of both, the handbook explains it all in more detail though. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 16:53, 4 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

Hi Kathryn - George from Megabytes team here - we are doing Always On too - so we're happy to contribute to your stuff - feel free to contribute to ours as well!

I'll put the same message on your team mates' discussion pages too to see if we can get some cross-team contributions going. Cheers[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 12:54, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Kathyrn - re the reference point you were asking about - one of our team found this link from Wikimedia - basically it says (near the bottom) that wiki doesn't use a specific reference style and as long as the style we use is consistent then that's the main thing. As our module uses the APA style we've decided to use that one for referencing inside wiki. Hope this helps! https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 16:35, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Kathryn, I think we should all come up with a relevant concept for tomorrow and meet up after the lecture. The other group seem to have covered a lot already.

Hey! Just trying to send all the Always-On people a message about the boyd section. In the discussion page it has been decided that we will write her name in lower case throughout the wiki page, so that it remains consistent and coincides with her actual wikipedia page. Thanks!

Hey Katrina, I was just wondering, do you think our group should take a subject each and try and work on that or should we just contribute to which ever sub-heading we want? [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 13:34, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi. I thinks it's a good idea to meet up. I think we should, instead of focusing on one topic each, try and get as much knowledge as we can about the other topics. That way, if there is something one of us, or the other group, has missed out, then we can include it. [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:18, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Katrina! So far our stuff has mainly been within our own group - it has been a bit easier to do it that way so far as we had a face-to-face meeting to discuss how to tackle the project. But now we are up and running, talking to other groups is sort of where we are now. We're all going to try to contribute to others now that we've got the hang of it. I'll see if I can contribute to your stuff soon. One problem we've had is that some other team members have put their stuff straight on to the book which has made it hard (impossible maybe?) for others to contribute to it - but that's probably because we're all just getting used to it![[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 17:37, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Couldn't agree more Katrina re editing the main book. I've put my stuff on now as its getting near the deadline - but don't know how to put the three tilds on this page! Any idea?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:25, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Hi Katrina''' - yes the contributions section on the main book is now there and all you have to do is go in and edit it and put in your three tilds once you've put some material on it. Three names there already. Cheers.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 09:49, 3 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

'''Referencing''' I can certainly try. The key part is the &lt; ref &gt; bit at the start of your normal reference and the &lt;/ ref &gt; bit at the end. Make sure there are no spaces in the entire thing however (I  just had to do spaces here because it would actually make it a reference otherwise, and just put the normal way of referencing in the middle.

Hey Kelly, after discussion today, we decided on the APA style of referencing for now, the details of this are in the module handbook.  For help with referencing on wikibook, here is a helpful link that Gemma found: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 16:13, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Kelly! I feel like some of the things you will contribute are linked with my definitions, so it would be nice to know what you are gonna write and if I should add anything to the definition part of the Wikibook page! [[User:StineEliseJ|StineEliseJ]] ([[User talk:StineEliseJ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/StineEliseJ|contribs]]) 17:01, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Kelly - good to see you today. Just been checking out other books - some have included a Glossary - which I think we should do because it is in the main book - and some haven't. And those who have are using different styles. The one for Always on looks good I think. Do you think we should just add to the main book as far as the Glossary goes and stick with the format that is there, or start ours from scratch? For what its worth, I think we should just add to what is there, adding only new stuff based on our own content. What do you think? Do you want to look at our other team member's stuff and build a Glossary?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 18:37, 1 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

'''Presentations''' We should really do this for our presentations. Would you be able to help me out in setting it up? :

Hi Elizabeth! One person from our group just created another user page like the one we all have (ie. mine is BobblehatImara; yours is ButtonsElizabeth) and named it after the group. We all post on the discussion page of that, like I am posting on your discussion page now. Just make sure that the creator of the page logs off of that and back on to their individual user page, or else Greg will not be able to track their posts on the page. Hope this helps!

We can use this space to discuss things together rather than having to organise discussions on seperate profiles because Wikipedia's user experience is horrible and unintuituve.

PLEASE NOTE: Please don't log in and use this account to take part in discussions cause we won't be able to tell who's who. What I mean by that is we can use this user page's discussion area to talk amongst ourselves in a way that Greg can track, but using our individual accounts. I hope that's clear...

Sooo guys. Has anyone done some research yet/ ideas how to structure this? I was thinking we could start with a definition (duh!) and then maybe focus on the different areas that online identity applies to/ where it is important, e.g. social media/networks, the gaming sector (avatars?!), etc. so how we present ourselves online really, maybe if online identity = real life identity (and the differences) and then as the &quot;flip side&quot; the privacy protection e.g. privacy settings, copyright, etc. What do you think?

[[commons:File:Tenacious D in concert 2.jpg]]

Should we all just do research on online identity by ourselves and then come together and figure out what's important what everyone wants to do etc? I feel weird commenting on this since I'm sort of the add-on in the group haha [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 16:09, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey! I've doing some reading about this and if it's okay with you guys, I was thinking about doing a bit about how development of social media has affected how identities are formed online. Eg. 10 years ago it was all chatrooms with nicknames and now it's on Facebook with our own names, like the identities are more authentic. I think I can maybe link to that technological determinism, too, since the computer that we had 10 years ago wouldn't have been able to sustain something like Facebook etc. Is this okay with everybody? Suggestions are always welcome! [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 10:01, 22 March 2014 (UTC)

Ok I'll just paste what I wrote on the other discussion board thingy (so confusing!):

I think that the privacy aspect is a really good idea since it's an important part of online identities! I also liked the idea you mentioned about gaming and online identities since some people are actually 'married' to someone else in their gaming world. You'll probably get a lot out of that since there's some psychology aspect in that too, I think [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 13:26, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

I agree Liisa. Plus you're lucky to have a psychology expert on your team (which is me in case you didn't get the hint). I was just googling some stuff and the first entry you get is of course Wikipedia (surprise!) but I though it could be useful to get an overview on our subtopic first, so I'll post the link for everyone here. Most importantly read the section on &quot;Online Social Identity&quot;!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_identity --[[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 13:37, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

That's why you're in the group, Lea! Should we also consider how online identities are important for growing business', cause when you google online identity, first suggestions are eg. 'how you can make create an online identity for your business' etc. But does that relate to our topic enough? [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 13:46, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Ok just to take the discussion here and to sum up:
⇒Liisa &amp; Lea: Development
⇒Martin: Security
⇒Euan: Interlinking
⇒Camilla: ?
⇒Imara: ?
I think Liisa's got a point here. Anyone interested in the business part? You could also talk about personalised adverts e.g. on Facebook.
--[[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 13:53, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

It's probably prudent to point out here that we are talking on Facebook as well and are still trying to work out how to make discussing on here work better. But yes, I'll be doing to security part which will cover things like how secure/insecure our profiles and such are. I'll do some research and maybe post some links in here if I find anything of use to us in general whilst doing that! Also I've mailed Greg about Facebook chat logging.[[User:Stirmartin12|Stirmartin12]] ([[User talk:Stirmartin12|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stirmartin12|contribs]]) 13:59, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Yeah, it's a good idea to post stuff here if we come across subjects that other people are doing because it is a collaboration after all! And we're all researching about the same thing basically, so help is always good. A lot of smart people = a really good wikibooks page. ;D [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 14:04, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

UPDATE: '''Liisa:''' Development, '''Martin:''' Security, '''Euan:''' Interlinking '''Lea:''' Personalised Advertising, '''Camilla:''' Online identities in the professional worklife, '''Imara:''' ?

UPDATE 2.0: '''Liisa:''' Development, '''Martin:''' Security, '''Euan:''' Interlinking '''Lea:''' Personalised Advertising, '''Camilla:''' Online identities in the professional worklife, '''Imara:''' Blending Identities

I think it's a great idea to all go and do some separate research on our chosen topics, then when we get some material down on our page that's when we can form a better flow and structure, and start helping each other out too. I'd like to take on the subject of blending online and offline identities, for example in the case of online dating, as Lea suggested in the Facebook chat discussion. Hopefully we can make some really good links between our topics and the lecture/seminar material aswell!

How's the research going for you guys? I was wondering how academic our texts have to be as I'm currently looking at loads of super sophisticated journal articles (I'm not going to lie- I'm not a business person and the stuff they say freaks me out a little)... --[[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 10:45, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

Had a wee look at the module handbook and it does infact say &quot;evidence of independent reading of appropriate academic material&quot;, so super sophisticated journal articles are ideal!

I just found a pretty good dissertation that I'd like to bring to your attention. It talks about identity representation in social media, especially from a commercial kind of perspective (so highly relevant for my bit) but also addresses more general issues such as privacy concerns (Martin?), anonymity, etc. Of course it shouldn't be used as an &quot;academic&quot; primary source, but it cites loads of theorists and general concepts behind impression management online. So you should definitely have a look and check if there is anything in it that might be relevant for your section or maybe use it as a theoretical starting point: http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/files/2013/10/A_critique_of_identity_representation_in_social_media.pdf
Also I was thinking about including something on targeted adverts, I hope this isn't going to much into your topic, Euan?! [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 09:07, 25 March 2014 (UTC)

Cheers for the material! It's a great idea to share articles we all think might be useful, so that we can help each other out as much as possible. Just wanted to ask, are we allowed to link to other wiki pages? For example, if I write the phrase 'online dating', I'd like to highlight and insert a link to the actual Wikipedia page on online dating. Is this allowed? Also, when we've got some information written up on our subject, do we want to post it in this discussion page first, on the yearbook discussion page, or straight on to the yearbook page? I'm guessing the latter, but one of the first two might be useful in terms of getting a couple of opinions before posting officially, though it can always be edited by other users once it's posted officially anyway. Just wondering what everyone's thoughts were. How are you guys getting on so far? I've got a basic definition for blending identity and a couple of examples, just trying to find some academic material to back it up and possible links to lecture and seminar materials. I was also thinking of adding a short word on misrepresentation of identity but possibly only through the media of online dating and fandom as I'm sure misrepresentation might come under someone else's topic (?) and I don't want to be stealing it. If someone else is already writing about misrepresentation, give me a shout and I'll steer clear.

P.S. Does this count as appropriate academic material? (http://www.dourish.com/classes/readings/Slater-SocialRelationshipsIdentity.pdf) I'm unsure as to how to reference this. Check it out though, there's some good stuff in there! [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 18:02, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

Yeah I agree with you, Imara. I've just finished gathering all the info and I hope I'll soon manage to actually produce something. Would be good if someone approved before we're posting stuff... About the wikipedia thing- I have no idea! I guess as long as you just use it as a starting point/ inspiration for further research without actually having to cite Wikipedia as your source it should be fine. That article looks pretty good, I'm sure that counts as academic. I was wondering how the actual writing process is supposed to work- do we have to add something regularly whenever we're working on it (so kind of like we would do in our word documents) or post it all as a whole once we're finished?! How's everyone else getting on? Don't make me feel bad by saying you've already started writing please! I've got so much other stuff on my plate I don't know how to cope..! [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 19:12, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

Someone else is doing blended identities too, should I post in the yearbook discussion page what I have so far and ask him to collate or just post it straight on to the yearbook page itself? I'm not sure of the rules here... [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 17:32, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

I think it would be best to cooperate. Just write on the person's personal user discussion board and organise your topic, so there is no time wasted on writing the same text basically. You could narrow down your focus a little or concentrate on a case study or something? I think that would be a good approach to it. [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 10:56, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

I'm currently making my first attempt at writing up all the stuff I found on online advertising but I realised I really have no idea what kind of writing style we should have... [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 13:06, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

RE:Lea, the writing style, having looked around wikipedia some, seems to be mostly focusing on accurate and clear writing. So another way to put it is to avoid literary flourishes and flowery language in stead of being succinct and to the point. Also, apologies all for my silence as I've been having some trouble logging into Wiki on my computer! But I'm back now! My security stuff is going not bad, I'm going to draft something up tonight. One thing I've noticed, and I've posted this on the books' discussion page as well, is that I've noticed that privacy and security are pretty interlinked for social media. Is everyone okay if I at least partially talk about privacy issues as well? EDIT: I've got a book out the Library called &quot;Social Media a Critical Introduction&quot;. It seems to cover a wide range of topics that are immediately useful to us such as security, information useage, fandom, social media in politics and even wikipedia (which I hadn't considered but I guess is a form of social media). I think there's another copy available but if not then if anyone wants to borrow the book or at least meet up to look at it, give me shout!

Hi! Sorry I've been a bit MIA, my laptop broke and had to be fixed and didn't get it back until Friday. The best part was that an essay that was due today was completely lost, so I had to do it all over again, which is why I haven't been able to concentrate on this project. But that's done now and I'll start working on it. You all seem to have handle on everything, so there's a bit of catching up for me to do! [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 16:19, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Oh, by the way, I found this http://www.postgradolinguistica.ucv.cl/dev/documentos/90,889,Social_network_boyd_2007.pdf which relates to lot of our topics, so look through it, it's really useful! [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 17:13, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys, i was talking to Lea and Imara today, and Lea said she was concerned about putting her piece up without it being proof read first, so i suggested that she post it on her own discussion page, and then tell us on here once she's done that. This would also help boost our engagement marks as we could then launch discussions on each others discussion pages which I imagine would help out our engagement marks quite a bit. [[User:EuanWhitelaw|EuanWhitelaw]] ([[User talk:EuanWhitelaw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/EuanWhitelaw|contribs]]) 14:28, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Im also thinking about switching my subject focus to youtube as form of social media and online identity, i was thinking about going along the lines of how it is part of the movement away from anonymity focusing on vlogs and the like, as they are literally showing their faces, voices and homes to the world. and i'm sure ill be able to tie in some theorists and things other people have written into this. I fyou guys think of anything that might be useful, I'm open to suggestions. [[User:EuanWhitelaw|EuanWhitelaw]] ([[User talk:EuanWhitelaw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/EuanWhitelaw|contribs]]) 14:41, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

That sounds good, Euan! Vlogs are a current topic and it hasn't been covered yet, so go for it! Maybe you could consider how often the vloggers have to perform and keep up a certain personality that might not correspond to their real life identity. Or maybe not, I only thought about that since I just wrote an essay for English about performing identities and Shakespeare's Coriolanus, so it might not be relevant to the subject of vlogs at all haha. [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 15:06, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah, that could be interesting to think about, because some vloggers show their actual personality and lives, where as some only bring certain aspects of their lives in, and others create an entirely different character. The theory pert id probably what im going to struggle with coz im no good at tying theories into the things im talking about [[User:EuanWhitelaw|EuanWhitelaw]] ([[User talk:EuanWhitelaw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/EuanWhitelaw|contribs]]) 15:15, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

The topic of vlogs is an excellent idea; it centers completely around a user's identity and is also pretty modern. I went ahead and posted a section on online dating to the yearbook page (pending approval), as I just wanted to get a basis down instead of posting it to my page and waiting for advice. However, I still think this is a great idea for anyone who isn't sure if their piece needs work or not- mine does, but I feel better having got it down on the page and now being free to expand and edit it. Loving all this collaboration and discussion! Thanks again for the idea of using Tinder, Liisa! [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 22:09, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I just looked at the actual Online Identity page and holy moly it's grown a lot since I last checked! Thank god no one's covered my topic so far. I'm still not quite sure how long my text should be- I have a feeling it's way too long already! [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 12:15, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

The actual page is so huge that I feel bad for anybody trying to read the whole thing. At the same time it shows how much there's to talk about when it comes to online identity, so doing a presentation about it should be no problem! I hope...[[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 15:21, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm slightly confused at the moment as one of my friends told me today that we kind of deliberately have to leave stuff out so other people can cover it. But then again, I know that no one else is doing my topic and it' not exactly stuff you can base on common knowledge anyway, so I'd rather write about everything I found out...?! [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 16:07, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Why should we leave stuff out for other people? Is it so the people who are going to do this on Friday at the last minute have something to write about? I think you should put everything you found, Lea, since it's your work and you've spent a lot of time one it. [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 16:36, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah that's exactly what I thought! Also I picked such a narrow topic so I wouldn't step on someone else's toes and basically had a section to myself. Even though I don't mind collaborating but I'm not holding myself back just because there is a chance that someone else wanted to talk about the same... And people can always edit each other's stuff anyway... [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 17:09, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Just go for it, Lea, it's only 2 days until the deadline and you should show off all of your hard work! [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 18:12, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah will do. How's it going for you guys? Everyone clear about their stuff? [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 21:06, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm getting there, slowly but surely. I think I have 2-3 paragraphs more to add to my content. I don't know exactly how long to make this but I figure keeping it concise and to the point is better at the moment at least and then it can be expended upon by other wikipedians perhaps. On another note, I know that we're meeting up about this this weekend, but I was having a think about things we could do during our presentation and also did some looking around and one idea I thought might be quite cool is if we get everyone in the class to write down their most recent status update on Facebook, or if they're not on Facebook then maybe Twitter, and then mix them up and hand them out randomly and see if people can guess who's status's they are. It works on a number of different levels theory wise and it's also a bit of fun. Thoughts? [[User:Stirmartin12|Stirmartin12]] ([[User talk:Stirmartin12|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stirmartin12|contribs]]) 22:17, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

well, on Lea's note just before martins... not so clear on mine tbh. I just thought about changing about what I am writing. I think Online Identity theft might be a quite interesting topic aswell. Looking through the wikipage, I don't think anyone's covered it quite in depth yet. 
I have been battling with sort of an issue relating to that with gmail, so it's a topic I've been (having to) look[ing] into... what do you think? Is it an useless addition to the page that already has lots of posts on Online Identity Management? Although none is specific to Online ID theft. ([[User:Camilla baier|Camilla baier]] ([[User talk:Camilla baier|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Camilla baier|contribs]]) 02:24, 3 April 2014 (UTC))

ok, scratch that. sticking to my old topic of online identity in the professional worklife. I will relate it back to self representation on SNS's using LinkedIn as a case study. Sort of..... I think. ([[User:Camilla baier|Camilla baier]] ([[User talk:Camilla baier|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Camilla baier|contribs]]) 02:34, 3 April 2014 (UTC))

Linkedin is a good idea, Camilla, and I don't think anyone's covered that yet, so go for it! [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 08:52, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Camilla:''' I think you're free to cover any topic you want as long as you can back it up with facts and link it back to online identity, so whatever you plan to do is will be fine. I think the professional perspective on online identity might be quite interesting though as it adds something a bit more &quot;practical&quot; to the wikibook if that makes sense... [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 09:31, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Guys, if I posted my stuff on my discussion board once I've finished it would you read/edit it for me before I post it on the &quot;official&quot; site? Don't want to embarrass myself by publishing something which is less than good (I don't expect perfection). Thaaanks! [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 09:49, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I think '''Martin''' and '''Liisa's''' ideas are very good. You really have to put some interaction in there, otherwise the other's will lose interest go on their phone *wink wink* Lea ;-) I've taught groups before, and it's always good to have a joker up your sleeve in form of an activity. You have no idea how terribly wrong time management can go when giving a class. You think you're completely prepared and that's gonna be the best class of your life, but suddenly you have gone through all your material, have nothing more to say and there's 15 pairs of expectant eyes staring at you and you still have 35 minutes to fill. It's not fun.
So I think having a couple of short activities is really good, while of course, like Lea said, not losing track of the objective of teaching. ([[User:Camilla baier|Camilla baier]] ([[User talk:Camilla baier|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Camilla baier|contribs]]) 11:01, 3 April 2014 (UTC))

==Presentation==

I created a different section just for the presentation, so it's easier to keep track what we've been saying. I like the idea you had Martin, sounds fun! I was also thinking about impression management while once again posting a picture of my dinner on Instagram. I took like 10 pictures of it and chose one, so if someone would like to volunteer their selfies as an example for that, it'd be great. Like we could have a slide where there's the finished Instagram picture and all of the other shots that we're taken next to it. Thoughts?  [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 08:56, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Martin:''' It is certainly a good idea to include some activity that engages the class and makes them think about/apply some of the issues and theories addressed in our presentation. So that would probably be a good start/end. However we have to keep track of the time and make sure the &quot;fun stuff&quot; doesn't dominate our seminar... sounds harsh but I hope you understand what I'm trying to say. [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 09:36, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Liisa:''' That sounds like a pretty good approach to it! We could even extend it a bit further talking about profile pictures on Facebook or even Tinder and Snapchat (where you only get to see the picture for 10 sec max but still we mostly try to send a decent photo)... [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 09:36, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Lea''' Good shout with Tinder, Lea since it automatically takes your pictures from FB but you get to decide which pictures are fit to be seen. Add to that, I have a friend who added tons of pictures of herself on FB when she joined Tinder and updated her interest list etc. just so she could get more/better matches. [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 09:54, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Liisa:''' That's exactly the kind of examples that I was thinking of. We should definitely try to include these points, maybe ask the class a couple of questions about their own identity management on these sites before we present our findings?!

'''To everyone:''' So just to be very clear- when, what, how? Meeting up?

Yeah, I was wondering about that, too. Are we moving it to Sunday, since Camilla's coming back then? If so, we should all look at the group presentation stuff and start thinking about how we're gonna do it. Should we book a room in the library for it?

Sunday could be good as most of us seem to be free pretty much all day, giving us plenty of time to blast through this. Early afternoon @ library? Booking a room could be ideal!

== Reply to your message on my talk page ==

In reply to the question about references; Wikibooks seems to be less fussy about references than Wikipedia.  References for many ideas which come from the same source, I believe, only need to be referenced once.  Page numbers are considered very useful if you can.  As you are developing this book for an academic project then it may also depend on the standards or requirements for your course - in that case check with your tutors or other students.  
There is no standard format for books here.  One idea would be to look at previously made books at [[Wikibooks:Card_Catalog_Office|Browse All Books]] or [[Wikibooks:Featured_books|Featured Books]].  The second link will show you some examples of what the Wikibooks community consider to be the best books and you get some nice ideas there.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:26, 9 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

='''Always-On'''=


&lt;u&gt;'''Danah Boyd about 'Always-On''''&lt;/u&gt; 

The common assumption of the term ‘always-on’ means to be connected to online activities twenty four hours a day. It’s like a never ending machine which consumes our life. For some people it’s like that, however Boyd’s theory suggests that being ‘always-on’ doesn't signify someone who is always available online. Boyd underlines that her ‘always-on-ness doesn't mean that I am always accessible to everyone’. She is not a prisoner of constant online activities; it’s not about physical presence online. It’s more about being always connected to the network. As Boyd says ‘it’s no longer on or off reality. It’s about living in the world where being networked to people and information wherever and whenever you need it is just assumed. I may not be always-on the internet as we think of it colloquially, but I am always connected to the network. And that’s what it means to be always-on’.  

Boyd argues that the boundaries between reality and virtuality have become blurred, and that the division which was once there perhaps does not matter as much in this day and age. She states that people who have adopted an &quot;always-on&quot; lifestyle are interested in living in an &quot;augmented&quot; reality which features alterations in their original life to fulfil needs and desires which may not be possible without the use of technology. ''(Boyd, D. 2012. 'Participating in an Always-on Lifestyle'. pp. 74 - 75)'' [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 14:07, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Being always-on is strongly connected with the availability of technology. Boyd mentions that ‘online is always just in the corner’. That’s when she came to conclusion that even while going about her offline activities  such as shopping, meeting friends face to face and etc. the technology is always there to be use. She can, anytime and anywhere connect to the network for example via her phone. This leads to her argument that the distinctions between the virtual and the real are so weak, that users have to declare &quot;off-time&quot; to let everyone know they will not be &quot;always-on&quot; and contactable (E.g. Facebook holidays), otherwise the user's friends and family will suddenly become worried about the individual due to their lack of connectivity. ''(Boyd, D. 2012. 'Participating in an Always-on Lifestyle'. p. 71)'' [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 14:07, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

According to Boyd being always-on is like being a part of the online community where people are connected to each other through layers of information. She calls it an ‘ecosystem in which people can stay connected to one another through a variety of microdata’. That’s where she made interesting point about online addiction. Some people see being always-on as an obsession; a virtual sickness which destroys lives. Boyd argues that always-on has nothing to do with technological addiction but more to do with the passion that people have for information and the lives of others.

Whilst Boyd seems to make a relevant point that our online lives are as ‘real’ as our offline lives, more could be said about the significant difference between these two aspects of our lives, in particular how we behave online versus how we behave offline. Suler (2005) makes the point that when we communicate online, our input comes after some delay, perhaps minutes or hours or days, and this affects what we say, in text form, and how we say it. Importantly, he asserts that when we communicate face-to-face with others, “moment-by-moment responses between people powerfully shapes the ongoing flow of self-disclosure, usually in the direction of conforming to social norms” (p. 185). If this is the case, if an increasing amount of our time is spent online this could perhaps leave some people struggling with face-to-face social skills necessary to fit into a particular environment, such as that of an organisation with a clear expectations of cultural behaviour, or to succeed in particular roles where face-to-face interaction with people is necessary. [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 22:36, 31 March 2014 (UTC)
 • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 10:42, 26 March 2014 (UTC)  Technology is only a new way to satisfy those needs.  
Boyd doesn't completely deny that being ‘always-on’ doesn't cause issues however It can be sometimes overwhelming; that’s why it’s extremely important to keep the balance and have a healthy approach for using technology. Everyone have to find their own way to be connected to the online community.


&lt;u&gt;'''Psychological aspect of ‘Always-On’'''&lt;/u&gt;

There are some psychological issues related to being ‘always-on’ such as:

* ‘Being drop into a mode of permanent online activity’. Constantly checking messages on the smartphones can lead to the point that there is no break whatsoever.  This situation can create lots of stress which finally makes people to feel overwhelmed, depressed and in some cases makes them even commit suicide. 

* The pressure of being ‘always-on’ is huge especially in the work place. There is confusion where the media demands stops and where the life starts. ‘Work and life are blended into a stressful soup of endless demands. In many workplaces, switching off is seen as uncommitted, even unprofessional’.  Many people are place in the situation that the demands from the work place take over their personal life.  (The Telegraph, 2 April, 2014) ([[User:Ania-polish accent|Ania-polish accent]] ([[User talk:Ania-polish accent|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ania-polish accent|contribs]]) 12:38, 2 April 2014 (UTC))

Thanks George I will do more research about it. ([[User:Ania-polish accent|Ania-polish accent]] ([[User talk:Ania-polish accent|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ania-polish accent|contribs]]) 11:41, 30 March 2014 (UTC))

After today's meeting, we decided for now to use APA style for referencing and information about that can be found in the module handbook.

Hey! I found some great disadvantages when researching Sherry Turkle that I briefly mentioned.  Ideas like the break down of communication, such as children struggle to form conversations etc.  She mentions this a lot in her 2012 Ted Talk.  In an article in the New York times she quotes a 16 year old that says: “Someday, someday, but certainly not now, I’d like to learn how to have a conversation.” The full article is: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/opinion/sunday/the-flight-from-conversation.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0. This may help for some ideas. [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 10:53, 3 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

Hi Katie, I'm from the other team who's working on cognitive surplus. Thanks for getting in touch! We're currently discussing ideas; one member of our team has posted a short introduction on the cognitive surplus wikibook. The majority of our ideas are being discussed on the page you posted on. Since it's mid semester break we haven't had the chance to meet as a group, so we've mostly been communicating through our discussion page and also on Facebook. We're hoping to use Clay Shirky's book on Cognitive Surplus as a starting point and hope to build on our ideas from there. We've also been researching the topic online and so far we have found a variety of articles which have provided us with some real life examples, making the concept of cognitive surplus easier to understand. Have your group taken a similar approach? [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 01:12, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi there,
well basically pne of our group members set up another account with our group name. No one's actually logged-in on the account, we are just using the discussion board to keep each other updated (without having to annoy everyone else), post links and help each other out.

Best regards

=== Usage ===

This template is used to set an uniform appearance on {{TL|Project|Trainz Projects}}, their Admin and template pages.
: It presents the same color (as seen here as background) for all such pages, normally used in a &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div style={{TRS-style}}&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; manner.
&lt;br&gt;
: but will take parameters 1, 2, or 3 and expand the formatting withing the quoted style when given such parameters (i.e. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; etc.).
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
;Internal logic (output)
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;includeonly&gt;&quot;background:{{{BG|#dbfffb}}};{{#if:{{{box|}}}|&lt;!-- skip - inherit from table --&gt;|&lt;!--
----&gt;width:{{{W|98%}}};max-width:{{{MW|99%}}};}}&lt;!--
----&gt; border:{{{border|{{{B|2px solid navy}}}}}};&lt;!--
----&gt; {{#if:{{{box|}}}&lt;!-- | margin:0 32px 0 2px;|
----&gt;      |margin:{{{M|2px}}}; padding: {{{P|2px}}};&lt;!--
----&gt;      |margin: {{{margin|{{{M|1em}}}}}};}} padding:{{{padding|{{{P|2px}}}}}};&lt;!--
----&gt;}}&lt;!--
----&gt;;font-face:{{{face{{{FF||{{{Face|Verdana,Arial}}}}}}}}};&lt;!--
----&gt; font-size:{{{FS|{{{size|10pt}}}}}}; {{{1|}}};{{{2|}}};{{{3|}}};&quot;&lt;/includeonly&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
==EXTENDED MODES==
: The template will also take stock formatting parameters BG, B, M, or P to define respectively: 'background', 'border', 'margin' and 'padding' HTML commands. THESE FOUR contain the prefix words just listed with the colon, so only define the desired variables.
&lt;br/&gt;
Contrast with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}, {{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; parameters which must contain the whole HTML format command including the colons.) Note strings passed to these appear later on the style string command, and may override default behavior or BG&amp;ndash;P differently in different browsers if they overlap commands. (i.e. Unpredictable behavior, so don't provide a conflict!)
&lt;br/&gt;
The ''''box'''' switch parameter selects an alternative default mode for inside tables, especially message boxes. P and M can still be used to override individually. It merely saves some typing and gives a predictable behavior and a uniform look.
----
;text appears like
{{lorem}}
&lt;br/&gt;
{{lorem}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Liver Diagram.svg|thumbnail|right]]
'''[[w:Livers|Livers]]''' &quot;is a vital organ present in vertebrates and some other animals. It has a wide range of functions, including detoxification, protein synthesis, and production of biochemicals necessary for digestion. The liver is necessary for survival; there is currently no way to compensate for the absence of liver function in the long term, although new liver dialysis techniques can be used in the short term. This gland plays a major role in metabolism and has a number of functions in the body, including glycogen storage, decomposition of red blood cells, plasma protein synthesis, hormone production, and detoxification. It lies below the diaphragm in the abdominal-pelvic region of the abdomen. It produces bile, an alkaline compound which aids in digestion via the emulsification of lipids. 

The liver's highly specialized tissues regulate a wide variety of high-volume biochemical reactions, including the synthesis and breakdown of small and complex molecules, many of which are necessary for normal vital functions.

Terminology related to the liver often starts in hepar- or hepat- from the Greek word for liver, hēpar (ἧπαρ, root hepat-, ἡπατ-).&quot; &lt;small&gt;[1]&lt;/small&gt;
== What do they do? ==
Our livers do three main things which helps and supports our body: digests food, makes proteins, and gets rids of bad stuff. All the blood that goes through our intestines goes to our liver where we get rid of the bad blood cells. So, all your blood cells have to go through your liver before it goes to your heart. Your liver is kind off like the protector of your body. The liver decides what gets kept out, what gets patted down and what's allowed to go through your body.

== Where are they? ==
Below the [[Esophagus]], few inches below your nipple.

== How do we protect them? ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">ion3 is/was a tiling WM that would primarily be operated with the keyboard, but also allowed for basic operations, like switching and dragging windows as well as resizing frames, using a mouse.

The windows are tiled in frames, with their titles in tabs above the actual content, so multiple windows could be inside one frame, but only one remains visible with its tab highlighted accordingly. Clicking the mouse on a tab is an alternative way of switching the active window. Secondary mouse button on the tab would bring up a menu with basic window operations.

It's configuration files are written in lua code, thus enabling rather dynamic setups.

ion3 also has a very basic floating window mode that could optionally be chosen when creating new workspaces (virtual desktops). Windows can not be iconified, but at least rolled up.

A minor flaw in ion3 is not being able to use the mouse to bring up a root menu for launching applications. So it could be operated with the mouse to some degree, but relies on the keyboard or at least some sort of launcher to start applications. Switching workspaces is also not possible without the use of a keyboard or a workaround that would translate mouse events to keys.</text>

;usage
:This template is used to tag [[Trainz]] categories regardless of volume organization. It automatically adds a Trainz category to the composite Administrative list [[:category:All Trainz categories]] unless the inhibit parameter is defined.
* It takes both the optional parameters &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{text}}} or {{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and presents that message inside the box shown above, which also first displays the default header message above.
* The message above can be lengthened with Administrative links for Trainz Admin categories by defining the parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{admin}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to any value.
&lt;br/&gt;
That message appears like this using filler boilerplate:
{{Trainz-cat|inhibit=yes|xadmin=yes|1={{Lorem}}... }}&lt;br/&gt;
* The parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{alt-header}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; can be passed entirely replacing both default message behaviors for an alternative title line, whereas &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{text}}} or {{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; still function as described.

Hi, I'm Gemma from the Megabytes, we've not heard back from other groups yet but were just wondering what referencing style your group were intending to use. Wiki states that they have no set referencing style yet they like users to keep it consistent (See here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf). Our group thought it would be easier just to stick with APA as that is the set referencing style for Media modules. What do you guys think? Look forward to hearing from you.

Hi. Here are a couple of the links that I was talking about in the discussions page. [http://www.thedigitalshift.com/2012/02/research/study-predicts-always-on-generation-will-excel-at-multitasking-lag-in-patience-and-focus/ Digital Shift] and [http://www.elon.edu/e-web/predictions/expertsurveys/2012survey/future_generation_AO_2020.xhtml Imagining the Internet] [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 13:43, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Rachel, I hope you don't mind but I'm starting to work on the newspaper section of the Wiki book just now. Would you mind if I edited some of the stuff you've already put in that section? I'm still looking for good sources but as a journalism student I can probably write quite a bit about it just off the top of my head anyway :) Let me know what you think [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 17:25, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

== References ==

We are using APA referencing, so just add quote and what you have to say about it then do the brackets after (**,**) and then put the actual reference in the 'references' section on the 'Always On' page. If you need any more help just write on my discussion page.

I've commented on everyone's discussions with the TeamAlphaDGM account so everyone should be able to access it. If everyone adds this page to their watchlists it means we can easily keep up with what's happening! '''Our topic is cognitive surplus.''' New section below just to list some ideas of what we should include! 
[[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 14:29, 20 March 2014 (UTC)

[[Digital_Media_and_Culture_Yearbook_2014/Chapter_4:_Cognitive_Surplus|Digital Media and Culture Yearbook 2014 - Chapter 4: Cognitive Surplus]]

==Ideas==
Free digital labour, the &quot;hive mind&quot; mentality, theories from Gauntlett and Shirky. [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 14:29, 20 March 2014 (UTC)

Picking central topics looks quite difficult - there seems to be a lot of crossover between Cognitive Surplus and Collective Intelligence, like the hive mind. Do you think its okay for us to talk about topics that might be covered in other chapters? [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 13:53, 21 March 2014 (UTC)

I don't see why it should be a problem, as Greg said at the beginning of the module we're meant to look at the module collectively and not treat each week as separate to the next. [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 11:54, 21 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys, I just found this video on cognitive surplus by clay shirky, I've not watched it yet so not sure how useful it will be, but I thought I'd post it here anyway http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cognitive_surplus_will_change_the_world [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 12:40, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

I just watched that video - he talks a bit about how generosity is part of cognitive surplus, so that could be another main concept? [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 14:22, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

I found the link to the wiki page about the Cognitive Surplus book written by Clay Shirky, I think the chapter list provides some good ideas for main concepts. There are a few copies of the book available in the library which would probably be useful for us. [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 14:34, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

The TED talk was really useful, definitely agree that generosity is an important part. Shirky also spoke about creating value -the examples he used were civic and communal value. I think we should mention it, but as a sub topic? I read the link on the resource list (&quot;Digital Maoism&quot; by Lanier) and he focused on the hive mind and the collective. Think we should mention these but again as a sub topic. However,  I think this resource will be very useful for putting together our presentation, since it discusses the use of Wikipedia in detail. [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 21:08, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/05/ff_pink_shirky/2/ found this interview with Shirky and another theorist, Pink, on the internet. Although it doesn't go into much detail I think it's useful in how it describes cognitive surplus in a way that's easy to understand. Pink also talks about humans having a &quot;third drive&quot; called &quot;intrinsic motivation&quot; which is quite interesting. [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 20:27, 25 March 2014 (UTC)

I found this link quite helpful in understanding what the concept is as it gives it some context in a real world example. http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/06/clay-shirkys-cognitive-surplus-is-creating-and-sharing-always-a-more-moral-choice-than-consuming/ [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 11:13, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

I don't know if it would fit in anywhere with the page but an interesting statistic nonetheless: http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/cognitive-surplus-visualized/ [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 11:30, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Those links were really useful! Its always good to understand how the theory relates to real events. I thought maybe in our main concepts section we could talk about the disadvantages/criticisms of cognitive surplus? Not sure how much there would be to write on it, but I'm reading through Clay Shirky's book and he talks about how some people are skeptical because &quot;sharing at a scale that competes with older institutions is somehow wrong&quot;. He also mentions that people have accused shared software production as being communist. Not sure whether to include these or not because they're kind of subjective/ peoples opinions, and I think wikibooks is just meant to be facts. What do you think? [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 13:20, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

That first link you posted, Mark, is really interesting. I don't know if anyone else noticed but someone from the other group has posted at the very bottom of this discussion. I've got in touch with her, so hopefully we can begin to engage with the other group who are working on cognitive surplus as well. Will be interesting to see how similar/different our ideas are! [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 01:05, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

So from what we mentioned in the facebook group our main concepts could be: the hive mind, free digital labour, web 2.0, generosity, motive and value? And then if anyone thinks of anything else we can add it in :) [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 21:51, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Again, as discussed on Facebook I'll start work on motive this evening and will update as to how I'm getting on so other people can contribute and edit it. [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 16:55, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Sounds good. I'm currently working on the concept of the &quot;hive mind&quot; mentality, will post something later tonight. However it does look like it is closely linked with web 2.0, so they could potentially be amalgamated. Still have a bit of reading to do on the subject though. [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 19:34, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Also, I am aware that I have not properly referenced my latest contribution. I have put surnames in brackets but will find out how to properly reference on Wikibooks. [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 21:10, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I'm currently working my way through Motives and will formalise what I've got written tomorrow when I've finished reading it properly. Should have it posted in the book either tomorrow night or Wednesday. [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 21:35, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I was just having a look through the discussion and found the link that Mark posted really interesting.  Always find it much easier to understand when there is a real life example present.  Also, following on from what Katie was saying about the criticims of cognitive surplus, I found a Guardian article which includes some criticism of Shirky's work itself that might be worth researching.  Not sure if we're including any criticisms because it is more opinion than anything else but I thought it was worth posting anyway. http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/10/cognitive-surplus-connected-clay-shirky

[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 00:00, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, I've began working on the topic of generosity.  It kinds of ties in with other topics but I'll aim to get it sorted in the next couple of days. 
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 00:07, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

It's a good idea to include criticisms as well so that we're not biased. Great, Katie and I were just discussing how it would be good if we could all try and post some content by tomorrow so that we have time to edit and format it, and collaborate with the other group. I found the lecture very useful today as it went into more depth on the idea of collective intelligence so I'm going to edit that just now. In terms of referencing, as Greg said we can reference it as we see fit. I think we may aswell use APA because that's what we're used to using - does everyone agree? [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 12:30, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I can try and write a bit about criticisms tonight then, think everyone has topics now so its going spare. APA sounds good to me! I'll have to read up on how to use it again, all my modules use different referncing systems so its easy to get confused. It still uses footnotes doesn't it? I'm reading through that link Jen posted earlier with the interview with Pink and Shirky, thought it might be useful because it mentions another theorist, since a lot of what we've been reading so far has been Shirky's work. [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 13:19, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Try that app, ReferenceME. Basically scan the book and it does it for you, lifesaver! Just make sure it's set for APA and not Harvard! [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 14:50, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I am happy just to use APA as well. I think I have sorted out my 'not existing' problem, can anyone confirm that my user profile is actually there now? [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 17:39, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, does anyone have any thoughts on what Greg was saying about posting our Facebook onto here? We have done the majority of our chatting there after all so might be worthwhile. [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 17:51, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I tried that app Jen, really helpful! Think I might use that for all my essays in the future. As for the facebook chat, would we have to each individually copy and past what we said? Or can one person just copy the whole thing? I found the wikipedia page about referencing, and it seems quite straightforward! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#How_to_place_an_inline_citation_using_ref_tags I think I set up the reference list in the reference section properly, so references should automatically appear there when you cite things in your text. [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 19:35, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah I think it's a good idea to put criticisms in, I can give a hand with it if you need any help.  And yeah I'm happy to use APA to reference the work.
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 20:41, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Just on the topic of referencing, if nobody has access to the app that Jen recommended I'd recommend you use citethisforme.com. Always helped me with essays! [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 21:03, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I've written up most of my stuff about motives now but am still wondering where exactly to put it in the book. It doesn't come under concepts or theorists so would it be a section on its own? Just wondering what you all thought. Jordan and I were thinking that because he is doing generosity and I am doing motive that we would sort of put both of those sections together seeing as they tie in quite well. They are both fairly sizeable sections as well so there should be a good bit of content there. [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 22:22, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Just thought I'd reiterate what Mark was saying.  After gathering my notes on generosity I realised how much it does tie in with motives and thought that it could follow motives in the wikibook.  Wondering what you's thought on the idea? 
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 22:31, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, I've pretty much got all of my notes in order for generosity so I will be able to upload that on the page tomorrow for edit.
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 22:33, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Since generosity and motive are chapters in Shirky's book, maybe they could go in the section for that? [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 11:53, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

So put it in the theorists bit? [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 13:16, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm doing a part of my generosity section on the Ted Talk he delivered in 2010.  I noticed on the page there is already a Ted Talk section.  However, I'm focusing on a different aspect than what has been written in the Wikibook which is directly related to motives.  Just wondering if you's think I should still keep it with the motives section or pair it with the Ted Talk section?
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 14:04, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I personally think that your generosity section should go in with Motive sub heading, just because they link in quite well. Don't know if anyone else thinks that there's a better place for them? [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 14:07, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

That's me posted my stuff on Motives ready to edit [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 14:21, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

At first I thought it would have been better for it to go with the motives sub heading since it's relatable, but I'm starting to think the TED Talk part of my generosity section should go with the TED Talk section.  I think it'd be neater for the wikibook if the book section is stuff specifically from the book and the TED Talk section from the talk.  What does everyone think? 
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 14:57, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I've also got a section on generosity from the book so that could go in with the motives sub section. 
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 14:58, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Does anyone know about text formatting? [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 21:35, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Mark, this link from wikibooks is very useful, I have used it for text formatting on my topic, &quot;Always-On&quot; culture, come over and check out my contributions to the page!

Hi Andrew, thanks for your help. I'll be sure to stay in touch if I need any further assistance [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 21:59, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

The chapter seems to be coming together quite well! I'll hopefully be able to help fill in some of the definitions tomorrow as well. [[Special:Contributions/139.153.54.182|139.153.54.182]] ([[User talk:139.153.54.182|discuss]]) 22:06, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I've been looking for criticisms of cognitive surplus but there doesn't seem to be much! I've mostly just found critical reviews of the book so far rather than the actual concept. Do you think there's any other section we could slot it into rather than making a whole section just for a sentence or two?

You could maybe just put it under the book section? [[User:Markconnor7|Markconnor7]] ([[User talk:Markconnor7|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Markconnor7|contribs]]) 14:21, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

No worries Mark! I'm posting some more stuff up on &quot;Always-On&quot; culture which you are welcome to read! Any time man! [[User:Thesmallerandrew|Thesmallerandrew]] ([[User talk:Thesmallerandrew|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thesmallerandrew|contribs]]) 20:37, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Seeing as we have until 5 o clock tomorrow to finish this, does anyone have any last minute ideas? What does everyone think about the structure? I was thinking it might be better to have the main bulk of the content in the 'main concepts' section, and then just have brief summaries of each of the theorists work (a couple of lines) in the 'main theorists' section, what do you think? It might be a bit confusing to switch around now, so it just depends what everyone thinks is best. [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 22:25, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Personally I think it'd flow better as a book if the bulk of the content came under the main concepts section.  The way it is just now it might look to some as if there aren't many concepts. 
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 22:41, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I agree, a lot of the content in the main theorists section can be treated as main concepts seeing as there is so much information on them, especially the Shirky stuff, seeing as the whole cognitive surplus thing is kind of his idea. Also, when I referenced my value section, I ended up referencing the same pages over and over, do you think there is any way to link all of the references into one citation rather than having a list of about 6 nearly identical ones in the bibliography? [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 22:46, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Or should I make the first reference a footnote and then use in-text citations in brackets after that? [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 22:49, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I was going to suggest making one reference and writing pg173-175 for it but I see you've already sorted it.  I've finished my bit on generosity, do you want me to put it in the main concepts section or under Shirky?
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 23:58, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I was going to write up some of the generosity section from the TED Talk that Shirky delivered but someone from the other team has already written about that so I decided to leave it.  I still have a lot of content from the book though. 
[[User:JordanRuddy|JordanRuddy]] ([[User talk:JordanRuddy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JordanRuddy|contribs]]) 00:00, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Sounds good Jordan! The page is really taking shape now. Will get some editing done before 5! [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 09:30, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Think I'm going to move the motives section into main concepts, what do you think? Feel free to move it back, I just think it links in quite well with the value section! [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 10:33, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

There's a line in the introduction about how we spend a trillion hours watching tv, does anyone have a reference for this? [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 10:50, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/cognitive-surplus-visualized/ that has the figure about the amount of tv, it is also in the book somewhere, not sure where though!

Hi, it appears that this user account is part of a class or group project.  We hope you are able to achieve your aims here at Wikibooks.  It is recommended to read [[Using Wikibooks/Class Project Guidelines]] to find out more about how group projects can work here and [[Using Wikibooks]] for a more general introduction to the Wikibooks project.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:50, 20 March 2014 (UTC)


== THE GO TEAM ==
Hey guys, I notice that your group are also focusing on Cognitive Surplus. The rest of my group and I were wondering if we could discuss with you guys how both of our groups could contribute to the wikibook page to make it a joint effort as we don't want to overlap each other's information! It would be interesting to know what aspects your group are searching and therefore my group can maybe look at another aspect of cognitive surplus that you guys haven't. I found your discussion page through Wikibooks and its a good idea! Message me on my discussion page to let me know what you think...and apologies for messing up your group discussion page but I wanted to post somewhere you guys are most likely to see! [[User:Kate Galbraith|Kate Galbraith]] ([[User talk:Kate Galbraith|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kate Galbraith|contribs]])

Hey guys, I have started to write about Shirky's book &quot;Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age&quot;, but I don't have a copy of it (I'm using the google books preview of it right now). The library says that it's currently on loan, but if any of you guys have a copy of it, could you add some info to that part? Thanks! [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 15:23, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey, I have also created a section on Main Theorists. At the moment, I have added some information on Shirky with subcategories for his book (as mentioned above) and his TED Talk, which I see you have discussed already. I have also created a section for Lanier and will write about some of his ideas on the topic. Are there other theorists we should mention? [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 15:30, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi! Sounds good. Basically nearly everyone in our team has taken a topic/chapter in the book to discuss, so we'll hopefully get some of that done tonight! Only other theorist I can think of is Gauntlett, but his work in this area isn't as important as Shirky and Lanier's. [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 19:34, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

That's good that your group is tackling the book, we could focus more on the theorists then. There was some good information in today's lecture that we could write about too. Our team will be meeting in the seminar and we will discuss what else we will do, and let you guys know! [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 10:54, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

We've briefly mentioned Daniel Pink before, not read much of his work though so I don't know how relevant it will be! He probably can't be counted as a main theorist, but it might be something worth looking into for some of the main concepts. [[User:Katie chambers|Katie chambers]] ([[User talk:Katie chambers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katie chambers|contribs]]) 13:22, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey, would it be possible to move the part 'Key Theorists' from the Key Concepts section to the 'Main Theorists' section? I don't know if it was written by someone from our group or yours, but this way things will be more consistent. The page is coming together nicely! [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 15:50, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

And looking at your discussion, we'll all use APA referencing? That sounds good to me, I'll make sure our group knows too! (and I'm sorry if it's like I'm spamming here, it just really helps to communicate with your guys!) [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 15:58, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Not spamming at all, if your group want to discuss the page on here with us that's fine! Makes things more consistent. Do you have a group discussion page? I completed the section on collective intelligence. I was thinking that too - the only thing is I feel that the descriptions both link to collective intelligence and it might be confusing if they're moved further down? [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 16:03, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yep, I just made a section on our group discussion page for you guys [[User_talk:FMS9A4-TheGoTeam]]. Maybe if it's made clear then (for example Key Theorists in Collective Intelligence) and then say that more information is located below in the Main Theorists section? I think that would work okay!

Hi, Katie and I have started some of the referencing. I just removed the citation then clicked the &quot;reference&quot; button, it's on the toolbar beside font tools etc, a little book icon. Then I just typed in the full reference and that's it! Though if part of the reference is in italics you need to fix that before posting because it doesn't save the formatting. So just use the reference inside the the ref tags and highlight the bit you need and use the italics button - ctrl I doesn't work. Hope this helps! [[User:JenHale22|JenHale22]] ([[User talk:JenHale22|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JenHale22|contribs]]) 12:16, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Thank you! Also, I'm going to start listing what words will need to go in the glossary, so if you come across any words that you think need to go in there can you post them to my group's discussion page, please? [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 12:54, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I've put the information on de Kosnik and Terranova into categories about them, to keep it organised. Let me know if it should be changed/added to. I'm writing a short introduction to them as well. [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 15:32, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I also think we could move the part on Copyright up to the Main Concepts and then create a subcategory for Lessig. How does that sound? [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 15:37, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey, just letting everyone know what I'm doing just now. Reading through the wikibook and double checking the spelling and grammar, and that the format is the same the whole way through it. Going to have a look and see if I can add anything into the generosity part of it about civic value because Greg says that's the part our group really missed out on.

Hi Lea. I noticed you said you had had discussions with your group- was that over wikibooks discussion, and if so would you be able to tell me how to do it? I think it would be a bit easier than the way we are doing it at the moment. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 16:34, 25 March 2014 (UTC)

RE: ButtonsElizabeth, your best bet is to either get them to post on the discussion page and mention your other team member’s names in it or potentially you could get them all to just leave notes on each other’s discussion pages. It is of course much easier to meet up with your members together if you are all uncertain of what needs to be done, or potentially you could make a Facebook group with all your members and allocate topics that way or even just share ideas, however, though these are considered to be more convenient, they will gain you no marks for input on the wiki book as Greg will not be able to take note of all of your ideas and the ways in which you have helped each other unless it is via either Wikipedia or the WikiBook. [[User:SmithBiancaAnn|SmithBiancaAnn]] ([[User talk:SmithBiancaAnn|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SmithBiancaAnn|contribs]]) 22:55, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

BerinLea, in what I am considering talking about on the wikibook, I feel has direct link to some of your ideas that you also wish to talk about for instance, how one may use online mediums to define and redefine themselves and gather together their sense of self, this I feel would come under the development of identities which is something you seem keen to cover.

RE: SmithBiancaAnn
Thanks for the input. I have specified my topic a bit more and will mostly write about personalised adverts- so how companies target users by gathering their personal information from social media.

Hey, youre doing the personalised advertisement aren't you? i found this article about consumerism as a form of self expression and it mentions how the the internet and SMS are used to further this, i dunno how relevant it is to what you're doing but it might be interesting to give it a read?

Hey did a quick read through, really good, strongly written and arguments are well supported, really good work! the only thing i could say would be maybe expand on the point you made about &quot;advertisement becoming a status symbol&quot; i know its a minor point but its pretty interesting, but what do i know :) [[User:EuanWhitelaw|EuanWhitelaw]] ([[User talk:EuanWhitelaw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/EuanWhitelaw|contribs]]) 14:28, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

== Draft- to be proof-read ==

'''Social Networks and Advertising'''

The terms '''Social network advertising''' or '''Social media targeting''' refer to forms of online advertisement that specifically focus on their presence on social networking sites. Social network advertising involves adverts being tailored to user information gathered from social media profiles. Given the enormous audience size and amount of time regularly spent on social networking sites companies increasingly become aware of the vast potential lying in SNS. Consequently online advertising is experiencing a shift from simply being distributed through websites to efficiently tracking and gathering user behaviour and personal information on SNS. This enables brands to identify and address their target audience and people that their product might appeal to based on their interests. The fact that these information originate from the customers themselves is majorly beneficial to companies as personal data can be analysed in detail without having to rely on their own statistical projections. Two strategies used in social network advertising are '''targeted advertising''' and '''customised advertising'''.

In '''targeted advertising''' brands aim to shape their product display according to website relevant content or their target group’s interests. While content-targeted advertising is adapted to the particular purpose and content of a website the advert banner is displayed on, targeted advertising tracks the users’ surfing behaviour on the internet. Several websites require users to register with their facebook accounts in order to later display similar advertising content on the social network site. Through the use of cookies people can be tracked back to recently visited websites and are therefore likely to be exposed to similar content on other websites. Companies are also able to track whether one of their adverts has been encountered by a particular customer before and are consequently able to avoid unwanted repetition in exposures and display their contents within appropriate intervals (Braun, 2011, Measuring Online Advertising Effectiveness). A look-a-like function enables the detection of facebook users with similar interests as the one recently accessing a particular website. 

Moving away from simply tracking people’s surfing behaviour via cookies, online advertisement has experienced an important shift to putting more emphasis on using profile information on SNS to create '''customised advertisements''' (Spyer, http://www.theguardian.com/salesforce-partner-zone/taking-advantage-of-targeted-advertisements-on-social-media). Social network accounts provide brands with valuable information about users’ location, interests and social circles. Likes and links to external websites further enrich the image of potential customers that might be targeted in future. According to their profile details users receive pre-selected adverts that are believed to be most compatible with their demands and interests and therefore should be more appealing to them. 

However the massive amount of data genrated by “real identities“ via social networks (http://venturebeat.com/2011/03/15/reid-hoffman-data-sxsw/) is also centre of the growing debate on the implications of the web 3.0 (Reid Hoffman, http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2012/02/the-dark-side-to-personalised-internet.html). As Joseph Turow suggests “the new advertising industry is defining your identity and your world“ (Turow, J. (2012). The daily you: How the new advertising industry is defining your identity and your worth. Yale University Press.) through displaying user customised advertisements on social networks. In this way commodification, capitalist social relations and market forces increasingly engage in and detemine people’s social life by exploiting the fact that to a large extent social interactions are taking place online (Cohen, 2008, The Valorization of Surveillance: Towards a Political Economy of Facebook. Democratic Communique [online]. 22(1), [Accessed 3 March 2013], pp. 5-22. Available From: http://udc.igc.org/communique/issues/Spring2008/cohen.pdf). Consequently social networks have to be considered a double-edged sword (van Dijk, 2013, The Culture of Connectivity: A Critical History of Social Media. New York: Oxford University Press.). While on the one hand being intensely empowering for its users, the fact that their data is under constant surveillance by data mining and analytics companies such as Daily Me, Medicx Media and Rapleaf can also lead to consumers restisting (White et al., 2008) the advert’s appeal as they feel their privacy is being violated (Stone, 2010, http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/technology/04facebook.html?_r=0). Thereby, the root of the problem is the fact that boundaries between advertising and content shaping the 20th-century media are being blurred through networking sites (Turow). However, the significance of personalised advertising does not only make user data a valuable criteria to shape brands after but goes even further. Through “social sorting“ social networks even impact structures of society in allocating people to “target“ or “waste“ (Turow) groups based on information published on their profiles. Brands can explicitely filter out the users that are most valuable to them in terms of a responsiveness to their product based on their interests, income or other characteristics.  In this way the advertisement that is presented to each individual user is indicating their social position in the eyes of companies, making advertisement become status signals (Turow). Nevertheless, companies have to consider the discrepancy between online and offline identity as so far social sorting processes are simply based on personal information generated on SNS. Therefore customer profiles only limitedly reflect the “real“ person behind the profile, including their demands of a product. While social media’s functionality provide the tools for people to construct an online identity they are also heavily shaped after the economic purpose of the site. Cohen (2008, The Valorization of Surveillance: Towards a Political Economy of Facebook. Democratic Communique [online]. 22(1), [Accessed 3 March 2013], pp. 5-22. Available From: http://udc.igc.org/communique/issues/Spring2008/cohen.pdf) suggests that due to their design and the normalisation of the sharing culture SNS can be considered part of an increasing commodification of identity through the influence of corporate interests.

That sounds really good Lea! Really impressive academic writing! Something that relates to that subject is that different companies are collaborating with different bloggers. Like a fashion blog collaborates with an online shop with the shop giving them stuff to review. This way they get advertising space, too. Though that doesn't really relate to personalized ads, so maybe it's not relevant to your subject. Anyways, your piece looks really good and there's nothing I'd do differently!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi everyone! My name is Rachel Skinner, a natural redhead with a typical redhead fiery personality and a love of sarcasm. I'm a third year student, choosing to study abroad in Scotland for a semester. I'm a American-born girl, used to cold and blizzards and food on a stick and wanted a change! I'm pursuing a Communication Studies degree from an college in the middle of nowhere-Iowa with minors in Management and French. I spend my free time writing, watching too much Netflix and singing only slightly off-key at karaoke nights with friends. Drop me a note on my discussion page with any questions, comments, redhead comments, or general curiosities!</text>

Thank you so much Rachel for verifying my User Page for me!!! You've done me a huge favor so thank you! On a separate note I am really impressed with the work your group has done on the Always On Culture page, it's looking great. [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

Not a problem LBLottie! And thanks for that! We are trying hard to slog through the content and editing but I'm thinking we'll have a great project to turn in on Friday! Your page isn't looking too bad either! I like the formatting so far!

Hi Rachel - George from Megabytes team here - we are doing Always On too - so we're happy to contribute to your stuff - feel free to contribute to ours as well! Our usernames are: StineEliseJ (Elise); Kellymcdonach (Kelly); GemmaMiller (Gemma); Ania-polish accent (Ania); amandajayner (Aj) and George Berrie (that's me). I'll put the same message on your team mates' discussion pages too to see if we can get some cross-team contributions going.

Hey Rachel, I was just wondering, do you think our group should take a subject each and try and work on that or should we just contribute to which ever sub-heading we want?

== Group 4KR discussion for &quot;Always-On&quot; ==

Hey guys... do you want to use this area for group discussion involving the concepts we're coming up with? [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 18:40, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

This seems like a better place for discussions. At present I'm
trying to find some books which would be useful. The other group seem to have concentrated on a lot of the material on the lecture slides and resource list so we will have to go digging for our own. Does anyone have any useful books just now? I've found a few I want from
the library but none of them are online resources so I will have to wait till tomorrow.

Good idea. I'll have a look for some books to get tomorrow as well. I think we should just try and find any other ideas instead of being assigned a topic each. Do you guys agree? That way, there could be something one of us finds that the others didn't. [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:48, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I agree with that. It also means we'll probably be able to
come up with a lot more stuff. If we come up with our own concepts first then we will have the chance to look and see if there's anything we can add or change to the work that the other group has done. 

[[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 18:55, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I'm down with what we're talking about here. This way, the book will seem more cohesive instead of a mere collection of random ideas. In our library meeting tomorrow, we can start a discussion about the direction of our page along with the potential topics we've come up with so far. I'm looking into some online databases for articles and relevant blogs to augment our research. I feel that this will help us dive into some topics that the other group hasn't talked about yet, or could provide some good additional information for their existing subtopics! [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 21:12, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys really sorry but been ill last few so not going to be at University today to meet up, however I think doing more research to try and find more topics for discussion is a good idea. I will look up some articles and books for research at home. Hopefully you guys are alright with filling me in about what happens at the meeting on this discussion page later.

Sorry to hear that you are unwell. I'll take some notes at our meeting so I can tell you the most important things we went over. Hope everyone is still ok for the meeting - see you at 2!

Katrina and I have thought about introducing privacy as a major subheading. The other group touched on it a bit but there's a difference between online dis-inhibition privacy and always-on privacy. [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 13:30, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Feel free to contribute any major points involving privacy in always on culture. I think we should add this heading tonight and try and have a draft of the information finished tonight. 

[[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 13:35, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, another topic I think we could do is separating out always-on culture in relation to the younger generations and workplace. I think there are differences that we could touch on there. I know, for me, I didn't think about adults having this problem before this class. However, now that I think about it, their work day doesn't end at 5pm. They might miss a morning meeting announcement that came out via email at 10pm. They need to multitask. I think there are all points we could talk about. What do you guys think? Anything else to add or change? [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 13:43, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I think we should include a section related to the negative and positive aspects of being 'always on' --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 14:32, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

These are all great ideas, and something that the other groups have not yet covered. I will continue looking for more information and let you know if I come up with another idea for a paragraph. [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:03, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys you all seem to be coming up with really good ideas. Not sure what else there is to talk about but i'll do some more reading and try to come up with something that hasn't been mentioned. ([[User:Kaf00023|Kaf00023]] ([[User talk:Kaf00023|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kaf00023|contribs]]) 18:30, 1 April 2014 (UTC))

Rachel if your looking for information on the effect of Always On Culture on adults within the workplace I found a article that discusses it and links to a few different studies about the '72 hour week' being created by always on culture. Its not necessarily as good as a book or journal but may be useful seeing as its discussing the topic your looking at, http://zocalogroup.com/2014/rethinking-always-culture/ ([[User:Kaf00023|Kaf00023]] ([[User talk:Kaf00023|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kaf00023|contribs]]) 18:54, 1 April 2014 (UTC)) 

I've also found some journals about the implications on businesses of an always online culture thinking of adding a paragraph on that to the page as it hasn't been looked at yet. What do you guys think ? ([[User:Kaf00023|Kaf00023]] ([[User talk:Kaf00023|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kaf00023|contribs]]) 18:58, 1 April 2014 (UTC))

That sounds good actually. I think anything that the other group haven't covered will be useful at this point! 
[[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 20:20, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I added a little bit to the main book there under disadvantages. Thought I'd just post it there and get it out of the way! I'm concentrating on privacy now but I'm not sure where to put it. Do you think I should just put it under disadvantages too? Also do you think I could bring in a bit about Paris Brown with the privacy settings? I know it was in the lecture so I'm not sure if it would be a good or bad thing to include it?

='''Always-On Draft'''=

==Introduction==

Here we could draft a revised introduction that better introduces Always-On as a general topic rather than an essay-like introduction. [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 14:17, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

==Always-On Privacy==

Katrina has got a start on this and is looking to finish a paragraph to post by tonight.

==The shrinking generational gap==


===The connected young===
One of the most obvious victims of an &quot;Always On&quot; culture are the younger generations, always on their phones or with multiple social profiles online that need constant attention. Ten years ago, a twelve-year-old would never have a mobile phone let alone be on social media sites like Facebook or have a profile on YouTube. Now, twelve-year-olds now have the latest mobile phone and can likely work it better than their parents. Unplugging a young adult evokes feelings similar to an addict going through withdrawal and depression (Telegraph, 2011). Unplugging oneself is not as easy as turning off a phone. Teens have so many technological outlets like personal and school computers, MP3 players, television, eReaders, etc. 





The Connected Young

One of the most obvious and commonly thought of victims of an 'always-on' culture are the younger generations, always on their phone or with multiple social media profiles online that need constant attention. This links back to the idea of their Online Identity Young people today are so constantly connected that if they happen to not post a picture or a status for more than two days, there is genuine concern between their friends about their safety and well being (Vimeo, 2014). Ten years ago, a twelve-year-old would never have had a mobile phone, let alone using several social media platforms such as Facebook or YouTube. Now, twelve-year-olds have the latest mobile phone and can likely work it better than their parents. Unplugging oneself is not as easy as turning off a phone. Teens have so many technological outlets and &quot;are growing up in a world that offers them instant access nearly everywhere to nearly the entirety of human knowledge.&quot; (Imagining the Internet, 2012) Thus, is it understandable, and frankly, unavoidable, that young people are a major part of the growing 'always-on' culture.

====[http://withoutmedia.wordpress.com/ Uplugged: The study]====
A 2010 study had 200 University of Maryland (USA) students go without all forms of media, including non-techonogical media, for 24 hours. After 24 hours, students logged onto class blogs and reported their successes, or, in many cases, failures. The results of the study were definitive: mobile technology not only changed students' relationships with the news and access to information but also had a profound impact on their relationships to their friends and family. The study concludes that constant connection to media has caused students to make different social and moral decisions with their 24 hours than if they had spent the day surrounded by their average collection of media outlets (withoutmedia, 2010). 

Severing the students' tether to technology created feelings similar to those of an addict going through depression and separation anxiety. Some students claimed that they had feelings similar to &quot;[http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/87/1/107.long phantom limb pain]&quot; experienced often by disabled war veterans. Students found themselves twitching towards their iPods or feeling their back pockets for their phone before realizing they were doing it. 

A question remains- do those in an &quot;Always On&quot; culture live a richer life or those who remain disconnected? A few voices from the study say that &quot;I believe that those who are not tied to this system are missing something... they are missing information.” (withoutmedia, 2010). Information itself is a commodity that people collect, trade, and put value in. Those who have a constant connection to media possess more information than others and therefore become &quot;richer&quot;. Without certain information or internet access, the world becomes much smaller. It could take several weeks to learn about the [http://edition.cnn.com/2014/04/01/world/americas/chile-earthquake/ 8.2 magnitude earthquake that struck Chile] April 2nd, 2014. Then again, how would that information even get to the end user? Internet is out, as is television and newspapers. Face-to-face would remain the most reliable transfer of information but the earthquake news would be dated and limited those who physically heard it from the source. One student commented that, “Those who aren’t connected through media probably have no idea about certain things going on in the world,” (withoutmedia, 2010).

{{quote|text=I find it difficult to fathom someone not being connected through media, because I know no other way...|sign=[http://withoutmedia.wordpress.com/study-conclusions/ Student Participant]}}

.nk this part could link nicely to the idea of online identity, I plan to include a brief connection to it in this paragraph. e.g The idea that teens are always on twitter/instagram updating it to make sure that they look good for their followers. [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:27, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I've found an interesting documentary about that is relevant to this chapter. I'm going to write it up and hopefully post it tonight, and if not then, tomorrow morning.

===Change in the workforce===

The thought of always being connected or &quot;tethered&quot; to technology is no longer an idea unique to younger generations. Exceedingly, adults are finiding themselves tied to their mobiles, desks, emails, and other forms of connection that can't be escaped at home. 




I was going to write a paragraph or so about this, and take out the bit about teenagers I wrote about in another section and put it there. [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:00, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Good idea! Let's get a start on that. I definitely have a few ideas forming! Mostly problems I've run into with working among so many collaborators on a single page. Navigating multiple users could be a point we go in to? [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 12:17, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Do you think we should make some sort of PowerPoint? And we can all add individual slides? I'm not sure if we have the facilities to use one in class but we could always ask Greg? I'm quite glad we're the second week so we can get an idea of what it's gonna be like from the people doing the first presentation!

Tuesday is fine with me, but can we make it later in the day cause I have a seminar straight after the lecture ? We could do it after the seminar and just head to the library from class if your ok with staying at the university later ?

I'm free from 11 till 4. I don't mind staying after class but if we all have a free hour at least before the seminar I think I'd rather do it then cause I'll be sitting about for 5 hours anyway :) [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 09:35, 5 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

:This template is used with {{Tl|ORP-bot}} to set off Trainz reference oriented and organized Wiki pages about intermediate, or advanced topics, categorized in ''[[:category:Trainz references|Trainz reference classed topics]]'' on the Wiki.

* It will not auto-categorize the page to the [[:category:Trainz references]], you must use {{Tl|ORP-bot}} to do that and more importantly acknowledge CC-by-SA-2.5 licensing for materials quoting the N3V wiki. That template may be modified on this wiki to do page to page navigation in the future as well.

=== Constraints ===
:[[../Create_Table#Table_Constraint|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- Denominate all contraints with an expressive name, eg.: abbreviations for
-- table name (unique across all tables in your schema), column name, constraint type, running number.
--

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Foreign Key ===
:[[../Foreign_Key|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- Reference to a different (or the same) table. This creates 1:m or n:m relationships.
CREATE TABLE t_hierarchie (
  id               DECIMAL,

  super_part_id    DECIMAL,      -- ID of the part which contains this part
  CONSTRAINT hier_pk             PRIMARY KEY (id),
  -- In this special case the foreign key refers to the same table
  CONSTRAINT hier_fk             FOREIGN KEY (super_part_id) REFERENCES t_hierarchie(id)
);

-- -----------------------------------------------
--             n:m relationships
-- -----------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE t1 (

-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--      ON DELETE / ON UPDATE / DEFFERABLE
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -- DELETE and UPDATE behaviour for child tables (see first example)
  -- Oracle: Only DELETE [CASCADE | SET NULL] is possible. Default is NO ACTION, but this cannot be
  --         specified explicit - just omit the phrase.
  CONSTRAINT hier_fk             FOREIGN KEY (super_part_id) REFERENCES t_hierarchie(id)
                                 ON DELETE CASCADE  -- or: NO ACTION (the default), RESTRICT, SET NULL, SET DEFAULT
                                 ON UPDATE CASCADE  -- or: NO ACTION (the default), RESTRICT, SET NULL, SET DEFAULT

  -- Initial stage: immediate vs. deferred, [not] deferrable
  -- MySQL: DEFERABLE is not supported
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_fk_1          FOREIGN KEY (t1_id) REFERENCES t1(id)
                                 INITIALLY IMMEDIATE DEFERRABLE

-- Change constraint characteristics at a later stage
SET CONSTRAINT hier_fk DEFERRED; -- or: IMMEDIATE

&lt;/source&gt;

== Alter Table (ToDo) ==

:[[../Alter_Table|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
ALTER TABLE t1 ...

&lt;/source&gt;

== Drop Table ==
:[[../Drop_Table|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- All data and complete table structure inclusive indices and views are thrown away.
-- No column name. No WHERE clause. No trigger is fired. Considers Foreign Keys. Very fast.
DROP TABLE t1;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Select ==
=== Basic Syntax ===
:[[../SELECT:_Fundamentals|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- Overall structure: SELECT / FROM / WHERE / GROUP BY / HAVING / ORDER BY

--     constants, column values, operators,     functions 
SELECT 'ID: ',    id,            col_1 + col_2, sqrt(col_2)
FROM   t1
-- precedence within WHERE: functions, comparisions, NOT, AND, OR
WHERE  col_1 &gt; 100
AND    NOT MOD(col_2, 10) = 0
OR     col_3 &lt; col_1
ORDER BY col_4 DESC, col_5  -- sort ascending (the default) or descending
;

-- number of rows, number of not-null-values
SELECT COUNT(*),   COUNT(col_1) FROM t1;

-- predefined functions
SELECT COUNT(col_1), MAX(col_1), MIN(col_1), AVG(col_1), SUM(col_1) FROM t1;

-- UNIQUE values only
SELECT DISTINCT col_1 FROM t1;

-- In the next example col_1 many have duplicates. Only the combination of col_1 plus col_2 is unique. 
SELECT DISTINCT col_1, col_2 FROM t1;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Case ===
:[[../SELECT:_Case_Expression|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- CASE expression with conditions on exactly ONE column
SELECT id,
       CASE contact_type   -- ONE column name
         WHEN 'fixed line' THEN 'Phone'
         WHEN 'mobile'     THEN 'Phone'
         ELSE                   'Not a telephone number'
       END,
       contact_value
FROM   contact;

-- CASE expression with conditions on ANY column
SELECT id,
       CASE   -- NO column name
         WHEN contact_type IN ('fixed line', 'mobile')  THEN 'Phone'
         WHEN id = 4                                    THEN 'ICQ'
         ELSE                                                'Something else'
       END,
       contact_value
FROM   contact;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Grouping ===
:[[../SELECT:_Grouping|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
SELECT product_group, count(*) AS cnt
FROM   sales
WHERE  region = 'west'   -- additional restrictions are possible but not necessary
GROUP BY product_group   -- 'product_group' is the criterion which creates groups
HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1000   -- restriction to groups with more than 1000 sales per group
ORDER BY cnt;

-- Attention: in the next example col_2 is not part of the GROUP BY criterion. Therefore it cannot be displayed.
SELECT col_1, col_2
FROM   t1
GROUP BY col_1;

-- We must accumulate all col_2-values of each group to ONE value, eg:
SELECT col_1, sum(col_2), min(col_2)
FROM   t1
GROUP BY col_1;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Join ===
:[[../SELECT:_Join_Operation|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- Inner join: Only persons together with their contacts.
--             Ignores all persons without contacts and all contacts without persons
SELECT *
FROM   person p
JOIN   contact c ON p.id = c.person_id;

-- Left outer join: ALL persons. Ignores contacts without persons
SELECT *
FROM      person p
LEFT JOIN contact c ON p.id = c.person_id;

-- Right outer join: ALL contacts. Ignores persons without contacts
SELECT *
FROM       person p
RIGHT JOIN contact c ON p.id = c.person_id;

-- Full outer join: ALL persons. ALL contacts.

==The Kind tag==
:'''''Click''' [[Trainz/Kinds#Kinds_of_KINDs|Here to Quickly Navigate to the Table of Contents of KINDs]]''

'''Kinds''' are a special form of the Trainz {{TA|container}}s data type and each is defined by an explicit unique keyword denoting one of a fundamental set of {{TG|e|enumerated}} basic data classes in the self-defining self-contained Trainz Asset definitions hierarchy. All the elements which define an asset are contained in a single folder accessible when the asset is built or opened for editing. The config.txt file within has the job of defining the KIND data elements and aggregating those and other mandatory and optional data definitions. 
&lt;br&gt;
 
KINDs are arguably only slightly less important than the {{TR|R|TrainzBaseSpec}} and {{TR|R|config.txt}} files as the most important data elements for users to get a handle on for either fixing or creating assets. Fortunately, each type of Trainz asset has a unique KIND, so these can be mastered either at need, or systematically one by one.
&lt;br&gt; 

In point of fact, all three elements are tightly interlinked as they work together within the asset {{TN|R|root folder}} which ''must contain'' the {{TL|config.txt|config}}, which in turn, 'must' contain a {{TR|K|p=kind tag}} and supporting definitions.
&lt;br&gt;  

To a lesser extent the KIND and {{TR|TS|category-class|p=category-class tag}}, work together to tell the {{TL|Content Manager}} software what other keywords are necessary, optional, or illegal within the asset's {{TL|config.txt file}}, and the latter has the defined purpose of adding ''that'' category-class ''member'' (the asset being defined) to a mix of various sorting criteria useful to users in the CM's sorting and selections operations.
&lt;br&gt; 
{{TrainzTip|BG=white|float=left|clear=right|width=auto|float=left|higher=|x=11em|1='''Defining an asset in the Trainz Data Model:'''
* {{TA|config.txt files}} = (''declarations'') {{TR|K|TrainzBaseSpec|p=TrainzBaseSpec}} + {{TR|s|category-class|p=category-class tags}} + {{TBS|Kinds of KINDs|p='''KINDs'''}} + supporting  {{TL|containers}} + include files ({{TR|D|texure.txt file}}s)
}}
Trainz Kinds are upper level {{TL|containers}} defining minimal data structures for characterizing a asset type under a single identifying kuid.

==Hierarchy and level==

'''KINDs''' in the Trainz simulators define the attribute that together with category-class set up required fields of information to make the model of an asset render properly. In a very real sense, the KIND data structure (grouping related data of disparate type relevant to the needs of model rendering and run-time simulation) is a first level {{TG|C|container}} in Trainz (albeit with a special name, &quot;KIND&quot;), and will almost always require other container level data groups accompany it in the ini files. These are enumerated supporting containers and tags which the combination of the enumerated types of the kind tag and category-class use to determine which other data elements must be defined for such an asset, which may be considered a sub-kind, for all like assets require the same data elements be defined as well.

Now all container and container-like structures occupy the config.txt file, but the distinction is simply that'' 'container defined types' ''usually have scope (applicability) in several different KIND defined assets and represent a shared attribute (a feature, e.g. bogeys), whereas each KIND is unique to that class of asset. KIND Engines and KIND Traincar both have bogeys (wheels on trucks) so both have a bogeys container in their ini file.
{{TrainzTip|BG=white|1='''Defining an asset in the Trainz Data Model-II:'''
* {{TR|K|TrainzBaseSpec|p=TrainzBaseSpec}} + {{TR|t|category-class}} + kind &quot;engine&quot; determine a set of required supporting {{TL|containers}} while category-class + kind &quot;trancar&quot; determine a different set of supporting containers.
* {{TR|K|TrainzBaseSpec|p=TrainzBaseSpec}} + {{TR|t|category-class}} + kind &quot;scenery&quot; determine a set of required supporting {{TL|containers}} while category-class + kind &quot;industry&quot; determine a different set of supporting containers.

==Important Everyday KINDs==
The answer is dependent upon what sort of assets and asset sub-types you are dealing with at the moment. Locomotives and boxcars are both Kind &quot;traincars&quot; in the human thought process, but are different KIND declarations in Trainz configs and a Diesel powered locomotive and a Steam Locomotive each need differing data parameters defined to model the asset; this differentiation within configs comes from the definition of the {{TBS|kind}} and the mandatory {{TR|S|category-class}} solely have scope inside {{TL|CM}} and {{TL|surveyor}} selection and sort filters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">From http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec05.html

Certain units that are not part of the SI are essential and used so widely that they are accepted by the CIPM, and thus by this Guide, for use with the SI [2, 3]. These units are given in Table 6. The combination of units of this table with SI units to form derived units should be restricted to special cases in order not to lose the advantages of the coherence of SI units. (The use of SI prefixes with the units of Table 6 is discussed in Sec. 6.2.8)

Additionally, this Guide recognizes that situations on occasion will require the use of time-related units other than those given in Table 6; such as using intervals of time be expressed in weeks, months, or years. In such cases, if a standardized symbol for the unit is not available, the name of the unit should be written out in full. (See Sec. 8.1 for a suggestion regarding the symbol for year and Chapter 9 for the rules and style conventions for spelling unit names.)

... And from http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec08.html#8.1

The SI unit of time (actually time interval) is the second (s) and should be used in all technical calculations. When time relates to calendar cycles, the minute (min), hour (h), and day (d) might be necessary. For example, the kilometer per hour (km/h) is the usual unit for expressing vehicular speeds. Although there is no universally accepted symbol for the year, Ref. [4: ISO 80000-3] suggests the symbol a.

&lt;div style={{TRS-style|was=&quot;background:#aadadf; border: 2px solid blue;&quot;}}&gt;
;usage
&lt;div style=&quot;width:84%; float:center;&quot;&gt;This template in the'' 'default mode' ''forms an LITERAL internal link to a 'logical' sub-page of the Trainz Wikibook references division '''''[[Trainz/containers]] with parameter &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''''' and the link will only be made if the sub-page name is explicitly correct and full&amp;mdash;meaning most times the parameter '''must contain the word 'container''''.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
* This works around {{Tl|TR}}'s default behavior and automatically adding and displaying such, for which ''the link will always be made'' with the word 'container' and display only &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or  &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; if given as {{Tlx|TR|C|name|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}.&lt;!--
* Example [[Trainz/containers/mesh-table container]] can be formed &lt;code&gt; {{tlx|TR|C|mesh-table}}, &lt;/code&gt;as '''the string ' container' is appended at ALL TIMES.'''  &lt;code&gt; {{tlx|TRC|mesh-table}}, &lt;/code&gt; will not form a correct link as '''the string ' container'''' must at ALL TIMES be manually appended as in &lt;code&gt; {{tlx|TRC|mesh-table container}} &lt;/code&gt;; notice the space in the preceding '&lt;code&gt; container&lt;/code&gt;'.
* It differs from the very similar call {{Tlx|TR|C|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} in that while {{Tlx|TR|C|name}} &lt;code&gt;'''does''' append ' container'&lt;/code&gt; for forming the link, it does not ''and cannot also display'' the word 'container' in the internal hyperlink.
:* To do that, TR must be given a definition for the pipetrick parameter: &lt;code&gt;( ''''p'''' )&lt;/code&gt;, cluttering up the editable text which is already technical enough.
&lt;br/&gt;
; Use this template instead of TR when you DO NOT want the word container to appear inline.
---&gt;
{{TextBox|1=
: IN ALL Cases, including the below (p=''pretty-name'') forms a over-riding'' 'pretty name' ''for display'' of the desired link-to-page of the '[[Trainz references]] volume' ''of the [[Trainz]] Wikibook projects.}}

:*Since neither TR nor TRC's above mentioned mode handle 'input=full titles' cases like 'Mesh-table container'...
* An alternative ''calling form'' of the template operates much like the {{Tl|TR}} template with the keywords |C|c|Con|CON|D|d|DIR|dir|DIRECT|direct|Direct= forming legal value links as: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/containers/{{{2}}}|{{{2}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
:* This mode converts N3V Wiki container links in &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[ ... ]] pairs&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to Wikibook compatible links, less the deletion of quotations needed for many TrainzOnline container titles.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[w:Colon|The Colon]]''' is the last part of the digestive system in most vertebrates. It extracts water and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body and is the site in which flora-aided (large bacterial) fermentation of unabsorbed material occurs. Unlike the small intestine, the colon does not play a major role in absorption of foods and nutrients. However, the colon does absorb water, sodium and some fat soluble vitamins. In mammals, the colon consists of four sections: the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon (the proximal colon usually refers to the ascending colon and transverse colon). The cecum, colon, rectum and anal canal make up the large intestine
== What do they do? ==
Also with our [[Wikijunior:Human Body/Digestive System/Kidneys|Kidneys]] and other main body parts that help us with our food, our colon helps us to digest food. Here is a copy of the step by step digestive system to our bodies:
&lt;center&gt; 
# Food begins in the mouth where it is chewed by the teeth into smaller pieces. The salivary glands release juices to help, and the tongue and saliva turn the food into even smaller pieces that will fit into the fit into the esophagus. The esophagus is a 10-inch-long tube that connects to the stomach. Muscles in the esophagus move food into the stomach.

2. In the stomach, gastric juices—protein substances called enzymes— break down the food into smaller bits. The stomach has powerful muscles that churn up the food until it’s a creamy liquid. This material moves into the small bowel

3. In the small bowel, the food particles get even smaller. More juices
from the pancreas, liver and gallbladder mix together in the small
bowel. Here is where all the important vitamins and nutrients in food
moves through the blood vessels that are in the lining of the small
bowel. The blood takes the nutrients to other organs in the body.
The nutrients are used to help repair cells and tissue.

4. What is left over, which is mostly liquid, then moves into the colon.
The water is absorbed in the colon. Bacteria in the colon break
down the remaining material. Then the colon moves the leftover
material into the rectum.

5. The rectum is like a storage- holder for this waste. Muscles in the
rectum move the waste, called stool, out of the body through the anus.
&lt;/center&gt;
=== A good summary of number 4 ===
On number 4, this is where the colon comes in. What is left after number 3 goes down to the colon and then the liquid is absorbed into the colon. Which then, good Bavteria in the colon break down the remaining materials, could be a few solids in there. Then, the colon moves the leftovers down to the rectum. Then, it leads to your anus, where you shit it out.
== Where are they? ==
The colon is located in the lower abdomen where it connects to the ileum
== How can we protect them? ==
Healthy eating is good for your overall health, but having a low-calorie,
high-fiber diet that includes many fruits and vegetables is important to a
healthy colon. A healthy colon will rid your body of the leftovers it no longer
needs. Your stool is filled with bacteria, so it is important to pass this out of
your body. If your colon isn’t working the way it should, you will experience
problems such as bloating, gas and pain.

&lt;div style={{TRS-style|font-face:Verdana, Garamond,Times,Serif,Arial; font-size: 9pt|border:2px solid blue}}&gt;
 
;Purpose
:This template is used with {{Tl|AM&amp;C-top}} to set off Asset Maintenance &amp; Creation division of the Trainz Wikibook pages.
:* This template closes a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div style=&quot; ...&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; HTML block initiated by the {{Tl|AM&amp;C-top}} header template. They should be used together as a pair top and bottom of each page.

* It will also auto-categorize the page to the [[:category:Trainz AM&amp;C]].
==Options==
# Defining &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{IT|}}}&lt;/code&gt; - Will the add the page to auto-Category: [[:category:Introductory Trainz|Introductory Trainz]] for pages when that classification is desirable.&lt;!-- 
---&gt;{{bullR
}}  It can be then given the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{TIP}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to alter the sort order of the page as it would be listed in that category. This will allow threaded pages to be grouped, if desired. TIP overrides (has precedence over) pipe-sort parameter  &lt;!-- 
---&gt;
# When and if given a defined {{{FUN}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; parameter, this tool will also categorize the page to [[:Category:Trainz fundamentals pages]]. This mode will be used in many Introductory Trainz pages, but both TI and FUN need be specified independently.
# Defining &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{refs2}}} or {{{both}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;  - Will the add the page to auto-Category: [[:category:Trainz reference pages]] for pages which can also be classified as a general reference page.&lt;!-- 
---&gt;
# Defining &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{domsg|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Will ''''''do'''''' the same output CC-by-SA-2.0 message box as the [[:template:ORP-bot]] footer for pages when that source crediting message is needed. Since a page may be a reference but not share materials with the N3V wiki, it does not auto-assert with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{refs2}}} or {{{both}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; sensing.&lt;!-- 
---&gt;
# define '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; '| cat1=', '| cat2=', or '|cat3='&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/code&gt;''' &lt;nowiki&gt;({{{cat1|}}})&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{cat3|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;) ''''''some-cat-names'''''' to add those categories to the page (without either &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;Category:&quot; namespace, nor '[[' or ']]' allowed&lt;/nowiki&gt;).&lt;!-- 
---&gt;{{bullR
}}   (they're provided free of charge along with the default 'pipe sorting' to the [[mw:Help:Magic words|Magic word]] &lt;nowiki&gt;{{SUBPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; page ordering, unless &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is defined to override for all categorizations.) If different pipe-link sorting is desired, you must hand code categories.&lt;!-- 
---&gt;

;global pipe-sort optional parameter &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* The tool can be given the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; default numeric/place parameter to alter the default sort order of the page as listed in that and the optional categories following below.
:* This is by-definition the first occurring parameter after a pipe but without a preceding '=' equals sign name assignment.
:* This is the same as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|1=&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''value''&lt;/code&gt; as is always true in Wiki-markup language. For example &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{AM&amp;C-bot|1=Serial}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is like to &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{AM&amp;C|Safety}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to wiki-markup, but the first 'Se&quot; will sort after the 'Sa' in category lists.

      <text xml:space="preserve">brain-view is a tool for visualising statistics on [http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/Services/HowToWorkWithObjectFiles MINC object files]. 

== Viewing an object file ==

    $ brain-view2 aug30_H149_gray_surface_left_81920.obj

[[File:Brain-view2 - Displaying a surface mesh.png|500px|The brain-view2 interface when a surface mesh has been loaded.]]

== Overlaying data ==

CSV data can be overlayed onto the vertices of the object mesh. The file must have one row per vertex and have the same order as vertices in the object. 

    $ brain-view2 aug30_H149_gray_surface_left_81920.obj  aug30_H149_native_rms_tlink_20mm_left.txt

[[File:Brain-view2 - Displaying cortical thickness data overlayed on a surface mesh.png|500px|The brain-view2 interface displaying cortical thickness data overlayed on a surface mesh]]


Clicking any point on the surface will bring the index of the vertex in the object file, and the value of the overlayed data in the Resources pane.

      <text xml:space="preserve">THERE is no work in the English language 
dealing with the Reptiles of Europe. I have 
therefore endeavoured to supply this desideratum, so 
far as the Snakes are concerned, by drawing up in a 
concise form an account of what is known of their 
characters, their distribution, and their life-histories. 
Professor Sordelli, of Milan, having kindly acceded 
to my request to reproduce some of the beautiful 
figures drawn by him for the work published in 
collaboration with the late Professor Jan under the 
title of &quot;Iconographie Generale des Ophidiens&quot;. I have 
been able to supplement my descriptions with illus- 
trations which leave nothing to be desired from the 
point of view of accuracy. A few drawings have 
been made specially for this book by Mr. J. Green. 
I have further to acknowledge the permission given 
by the Trustees of the British Museum, the India 
Office, and the Zoological Society, to reproduce a few 
figures from previous publications of which I am the 
author. 

In order to render this little book more useful, the 
account of the Snakes of Europe has been preceded
by an Introduction summarizing what is known of 
Snakes generally. 

I have purposely avoided overburdening a work of 
this kind, which aims at concision, with bibliographical
references and synonymic lists. I am sure my 
readers will be thankful for being spared this display 
of erudition. Whenever I have had to compile, and 
to trespass on ground that is not my own, I have 
been careful to draw only from the writings of the 
most trustworthy authorities. The descriptions of 
the species are based on the collection in the British 
Museum, which has been considerably increased 
since the publication of the Catalogue of Snakes 
(1893-1896). I have also had access to Monsieur F. 
Lataste's rich private collection, now under my care, 
and Dr. R. Gestro has kindly entrusted to me for 
study the collection of Italian Snakes in the Genoa 
Museum. I am indebted to Dr. L. W. Sambon for 
the chapter on Parasites, which he has written at 
my request. 

To all who have helped me I beg to tender my 

hearty thanks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SNAKES, are scientifically defined as the suborder Serpentes under the order Squamata and are in the family Reptiliae, the reptiles, which includes the Lizards, Lacertilia, the Chameleons, 
Rhiptoglossa, and the extinct Dolichosauria and 
Mosasauria. Snakes may be defined as greatly elongate 
scaly Reptiles without limbs, or with mere vestiges 
of the hind pair, without movable eyelids, without 
ear-opening, with elongate, deeply forked tongue 
retractile into a basal sheath, with transverse vent 
and paired copulatory organs, and with the two 
halves of the lower jaw independently movable, 
connected at the symphysis by an elastic ligament. 

The latter character alone distinguishes them 
from all Lizards, but no single Lizard possesses all 
the others in combination. 

In their most highly developed form these Reptiles 
are adapted for rapid reptation and for swallowing prey much exceeding their own calibre; hence the 
bones of the skull, on which a prehensile function 
devolves, are loosely attached to the cranium by 
ligamentous elastic tissue, or articulated in such a 
manner as to permit a wide buccal expansion; whilst 
the absence of a sternum and the mobile attach- 
ment of the ribs allow a corresponding dilatation of 
the body as the prey descends into the digestive canal. 

The fatal venom which certain of these Reptiles 
possess has so impressed the mind of men, that for a long time snakes were primarily 
divided into poisonous and non-poisonous, a classi- 
fication in which the more important characters, 
derived from the general structure, and especially 
from the skull, were subordinated to the physio- 
logical. Such a system was far from reflecting 
natural relationships. Besides, as our knowledge 
progressed, drawing a distinction between poisonous 
and harmless snakes became more and more diffi- 
cult, so many snakes previously regarded as harmless 
proving to be poisonous in various degrees- at least 
enough to paralyze the small prey on which they 
subsist, if not to be of serious danger to man. 

In the division into families, as followed in this 
work, the presence or absence of a poison organ is 
left out of consideration. Further, in this as in 
many other groups of the animal kingdom, external 
characters do not furnish trustworthy indications 
for higher divisions, and the definitions of the 
families are therefore based exclusively on osteo- 
logical characters. For those who wish to name 
snakes with facility, the key which concludes the 
chapter on External Characters will, however, remedy 
this defect, and suffice for the identification of all 
the European species without any reference to their 
anatomy. Many attempts have been made to 
furnish an easy criterion for the distinction of harm- 
less from poisonous snakes, but the characters 
hitherto suggested with this object can only be ap- 
plied successfully to the small number of representa- 
tives in a limited area. Thus, in Southern Australia 
it might be stated that all snakes showing the regular 
nine large shields on the upper surface of the head 
are dangerous to man, whilst those with small 
shields or scales are harmless ; but in most parts of 
Europe this criterion would have to be reversed. In 
some countries the shape of the pupil might be used 
for the purpose, in others the size of the ventral 
shields, or the presence or absence of a loreal shield, 
between the nasal and the preocular, and so on. 
But when we have to deal with the snakes of the 
whole world, about 2,000 species, of which nearly 
one-third are poisonous to a greater or less degree, 
every attempt at a definition of the two categories 
without regard to the dentition breaks down. Only 
those who have made a study of the snakes of the 
world can make a guess from the general appearance 
as to an unknown form being poisonous or not, and 
even they may sometimes feel embarrassed, unless 
the dentition be examined; the mistakes which 
have occasionally been made by some experienced 
herpetologists are proof sufficient of the fallacy of 
external characters for this purpose. 

The Ophidia are divided into nine families, the 
first, third, seventh, and ninth of which have repre- 
sentatives in Europe : 

I. No transverse (ectopterygoid) bone ; pterygoid 
not extending to quadrate or mandible ; no supra- 
temporal ; nasals in contact with prefrontals ; 
coronoid present ; vestiges of pelvis. 

Maxillary loosely attached to lower surface of 
cranium, toothed; lower jaw edentulous; a single 
pelvic bone i. Typhlopid^. 

Maxillary bordering mouth, forming a suture with 
premaxillary, prefrontal, and frontal, toothless ; 
pubis and ischium present, latter forming a sym- 
physis 2. Glauconiid^e. 

II. Transverse bone present ; both jaws toothed. 

A . Coronoid present ; nasals in contact with pre- 
frontals, 
i. Vestiges of pelvis ; supratemporal present. 
Supratemporal large, suspending quadrate 

3. BoiDiE. 

(Subfamilies : Pythonincz, Boince.) 
Supratemporal small, intercalated in the cranial wall 

4. Ilysiidjs. 


2. No vestiges of pelvis ; supratemporal absent 

5. Uropeltid,e. 

B. Coronoid absent ; supratemporal present. 

1. Maxillary horizontal ; pterygoids reaching 

quadrate or mandible. 

Nasals in contact with prefrontals 

6. Xenopeltid.e. 
N asals not in contact with prefrontals 

7. COLUBRID.E. 

Three series: A. Aglypha (subfamilies: Acrochor- 
dince, Colubrince, Dasypeltince) ; B. Opisthoglypha 
(Homalopsincz, Dipsadomorphincz, Elachistodontince) ; 

C. Proteroglypha {Hydrophiince, Elapincz). 

2. Maxillary horizontal, converging posteriorly 

towards palatine ; pterygoid not reaching 
quadrate or mandible 8. Amblycephalid.e. 

3. Maxillary vertically erectile perpendicularly to 

transverse bone; pterygoid reaching quad- 
rate or mandible 9. Viperid^e. 

(Subfamilies : Viperince, Crotalince.) 

The technical terms employed in the above 
synopsis will be found explained and illustrated by 
figures in the chapter on the Skeleton. 

No serial arrangement can express the affinities 
of the various groups as conceived by the classifi
cator; a diagram therefore follows to show the 
author's views as to their interrelationships, and 
possibly their phylogeny. Leaving aside the 
Typhlopidae and Glauconiidae, which should be regarded as burrowing types independently derived 
from some Ophidian form less specialized than any 
with which we are at present acquainted, and prob- 
ably without direct relationship to the Lizards, the 
family Boidae, and more especially the Pythons, 
claim the position of ancestral group, from which 
all other snakes may have been derived.

Further remarks on this subject in the chapter 
on Dentition. 

It is to be regretted that paleontology cannot 
help us at present as concerns the lines of evolution, 
the comparatively few fossil Ophidians known, from 
the Lower Eocene upwards, the remains of which 
can be identified with some measure of certainty, 
being either non-poisonous types (Boidce, Ilysiidce, 
Palceophiidce, Colubvidce) or Viperidce (Viperines from 
the Miocene of France and Germany, Crotalines from 
the Miocene of North America). The vertebrae from 
the Puerco Eocene of America, on the limit between 
the Cretaceous and Eocene periods, described as the 
oldest snake remains, Helagras, Cope, are stated to 
approach the Lacertilian type. 

Whether the vertebrae named Symoliophis, 
Sauvage, from the chalk of France, and Coniophis, 
Marsh, from the Laramie Cretaceous of North 
America, are Ophidian, as claimed by their descri- 
bes, or Dolichosaurian, cannot be decided without 
further material.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== HABITS === 

SNAKES may be grouped, according to their 
mode of life, in five principal categories, 
gradually merging into each other, or two of them 
not infrequently found combined in one and the 
same species. These categories are: Ground-snakes, 
Sand-snakes, Burrovving-snakes, Tree- snakes, and 
Water-snakes. 

Ground-snakes may be defined as living above 
ground, and only occasionally climbing bushes or 
entering the water. Among European genera, 
Coronella and Vipera are perfect examples of this 
type, whilst Coluber and Zamenis approach the 
Tree-snakes in often ascending bushes, or even 
trees. 

Sand-snakes are adapted for living on loose 
sand, in which they seek concealment. Such are 
Lytorhynchus and some Psammophis among the 
Colubridse, Cerastes among the Viperidse. Eryx connects 
this category with the next. 

Burrowing-snakes live chiefly underground, and 
often have the visual organ atrophied in consequence, 
as in Typhlops ; all the Typhlopidae, Glauconiidae, 
and Uropeltidae, belong to this category; the Viperid 
Atractaspis is also a burrowing type. 

Tree-snakes spend the greater part of their life on 
bushes or trees. Corralus among the Boidae, Dendrophis 
and Dendraspis among the Colubridae, Atheris, 
and various species of Lachesis among the Viperidae, 
may be quoted as examples. 

Of Water-snakes, some are exclusively aquatic, 
like the marine Hydrophiinse and the typical 
Acrochordinae {Acrochordus, Chersydrus) and Homalopsinae 
(Hipistes, Herpeton). Chersydrus and Hipistes 
occur in the sea as well as in fresh water. Many 
species of Tropidonotus (T. tessellatus and T. viperinus 
in Europe), as well as the genera Helicops, Grayia, 
Boidengerina, etc., among the Colubridae, Eunectes 
among the Boidae, Ancistrodon piscivorus among the 
Viperidae, are chiefly but not exclusively aquatic. 

Our Natrix natrix stands between the 
Ground-snakes and the Water-snakes; Boas and 
Pythons are as much Water-snakes as Tree-snakes. 
As shown by these and many other examples which 
might be given, a division into categories cannot 
always be applied with precision, nor does it convey 
an expression of the natural relationships of the 
species, as was believed by many systematists of the 
last century, who appealed to such adaptations for 
the definition of families. 

A vertical pupil denotes more or less nocturnal 
habits. Nevertheless our European Vipers, which 
are provided with such a contractile pupil, are far 
from exclusively nocturnal, delighting to bask in the 
sun, and pairing and feeding in the day-time. The 
Boidse appear to be more nocturnal, but no snake is 
known to be absolutely so, and the two species of 
Coluber which have been found living in perfect 
darkness in limestone caves in the Malay Peninsula 
and China, where they feed chiefly on bats, occur 
also outside the caves, and probably never breed in 
them. 

It is often stated in books that the organs of 
locomotion for the exceedingly elongate body of 
snakes are the ribs, and these creatures have even 
been compared to Centipedes. This statement is no 
doubt true to a certain extent for slow locomotion 
on uneven ground, when the ribs and the corresponding 
ventral shields afford a point of support; 
but it does not account for the rapid movements, as 
when a snake darts like an arrow in pursuit of its 
prey or to escape from an enemy. Besides, the 
winding motions are not different from those of a 
Slow-worm or Glass-snake, in which, encased as they 
are in a bony armour, the ribs cannot come into 
play at all. The action of the muscles alone is quite 
sufficient to account for the reptation of snakes, 
without the ribs having to play an essential part. 

Not only the Cobras, but also several harmless snakes, 
are able to raise the anterior third of the body 
vertically, when taking up a threatening attitude in
the presence of an enemy, at the same time widening 
or inflating the region behind the head. 

Most snakes can climb, and in this case the ribs 
and ventral shields are of great assistance. The Tree-snakes,
usually characterized by a very slender, sometimes compressed,
body, or by a prehensile tail, are 
specially adapted for twining themselves round 
branches, and in several of them the presence of a keel 
on each side of the ventral and subcaudal shields, 
accompanied by a notch corresponding to the keel, 
affords an additional help for climbing on vertical uneven
surfaces, such as the trunks of trees. This condition 
of the ventral shields has a bearing on the 
extraordinary mode of locomotion with which some 
Tree-snakes [Chrysopelea, and probably also Dendrophis)
have long been credited by the Malays. We allude 
to the so-called Flying-snakes, remarkable for their 
habit of shooting down from trees and descending to 
the ground at an oblique angle, the body being kept 
rigid the whole time of the &quot;flight&quot;. It has been 
observed in Chrysopelea that the ventral surface 
between the lateral keels, which may be compared 
to hinges, can be drawn in and become deeply 
concave, whilst at the same time a slight dorsoventral 
flattening of the body takes place. During 
this muscular contraction the snake is like a piece of 
bamboo bisected longitudinally, and is buoyed up in 
such a way as to explain its parachute-like descent. 

All snakes are able to swim, and the more aquatic 
kinds may spend a few hours under the water. A 
Python molurus is known to have remained alive in a 
basket sunk for thirty-six hours in a river. The best 
adapted for aquatic life are the Hydrophiinae, or Sea- 
snakes, most of which never leave the water, and 
are quite helpless and soon die when brought on 
shore ; their body is more or less compressed 
posteriorly, and the tail oar-shaped. Seaweeds and 
barnacles sometimes settle on them. Algae have also 
been observed growing on the fresh-water snake 
Erpeton tentaculatum. 

As regards food, Burrowing-snakes, as well as a 
few small Ground-snakes, subsist mostly on worms, 
insects, and myriopods; Tree-snakes on lizards, 
frogs, birds and their eggs; Water-snakes on fishes 
and batrachians. Among the other types, some 
show a predilection for mammals, others for lizards 
or snakes, whilst not a few feed indiscriminately 
upon mammals, birds, reptiles and batrachians, even 
on slugs, insects, and worms, in addition. However 
surprising, it is a fact that spiny mammals are 
occasionally eaten, spines of the Madagascar Hedge- 
hog (Ericulns) having been found in the excrements 
of a Boa madagascariensis. Even hard-shelled eggs 
and molluscs may constitute the principal or 
exclusive food of certain snakes. 

Thus, Dasypeltis eats nothing but birds' eggs, the 
shells of which are crushed in the gullet, by a special 
contrivance mentioned above (p. 80), and are soon 
after rejected through the mouth as a pellet. Other 
snakes, such as Coluber and Lioheterodon show them- 
selves partial to eggs in addition to live prey, but 
their alimentary canal does not depart from the 
normal, the eggs being broken in the stomach and 
the remains of the shells passed with the excrements. 

The Amblycephalidse subsist almost entirely on 
snails and slugs, the shells of the former being 
crushed in the anterior part of the intestine after 
their contents have been digested, and the debris are 
rejected through the vent. A small land tortoise has 
been found in the stomach of a Cobra (Naia hate) 
from Algeria. 

Snakes which take large prey secure it according 
to three methods: By catching it simply with the 
jaws, and immediately proceeding to swallow it, as 
in Tropidonotus and in some of the Constrictors when 
dealing with small animals; by constriction, after 
having seized it with the jaws, crushing it in the 
coils of their body and thus killing it previous 
to feeding, as in the Boidse and Coluber; or by 
poisoning, by a mere stroke with the fangs, the 
result being awaited before the meal is begun, as in 
most of the Viperidae. Other poisonous snakes 
proceed according to the first method, the use of the 
venom being to reduce the struggles of the victim 
and to relax its muscles. Such snakes as are in the 
habit of previously killing their prey show little 
reluctance to accept dead food in confinement, a 
thing which others usually refuse to do; they 
may, however, be deceived by the dead animal 
being agitated before them, and the system now 
adopted in our Zoological Gardens, of offering all 
snakes previously-killed animals, has been attended 
with comparative success. 

Some species feed almost exclusively on other 
snakes, and often manage to swallow individuals as 
large as, or even a little larger than, themselves. 
Examples are known of harmless snakes showing 
a predilection for dangerous species, to whose poison 
they are immune. 

As a rule snakes that eat fish will also eat batrachians,
but nothing higher in the scale, although 
exceptions have been reported, such as the Anaconda 
feeding on mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish, and our 
Grass-snake having taken mice and birds. Some that 
feed chiefly on lizards and snakes will occasionally eat 
also mammals, and vice versa, but rarely frogs. On 
the other hand, European Vipers accommodate themselves 
to a more varied bill of fare, being known to 
feed on mammals, birds, reptiles, batrachians, insects, 
and slugs, and they have even been observed to eat 
voles showing signs of putrefaction. 

The enormous prey which some snakes are able 
to swallow is quite astounding. Anacondas and 
Pythons, the largest snakes, have been known to 
swallow calves and good-sized antelopes with their 
horns, animals which, even after being somewhat 
crushed by constriction, very much exceed the 
calibre of the snake. A Python molurus, 17 feet long, 
is reported on good evidence to have swallowed a 
gravid Axis deer. A Grass-snake half an inch in 
diameter can manage a frog or toad three times 
that width, and a Dasypeltis of the same size a hen's 
egg. Such feats are rendered possible by the 
mobility of the jaws and palato-pterygoid arch on 
the cranium, and the elasticity of the ligaments by 
which they are attached), as well 
as by the mobility of the ribs and the absence of 
sternal apparatus, together with the great distensibility 
of the skin. When a snake proceeds to 
dispose of a large prey, which, if it be a mammal or 
bird, is usually seized head-first, it pulls itself 
forward by alternate movements of the jaws, the 
maxillary and the mandibular ramus of the one side, 
and then of the other, being extended anteriorly and 
laterally, the snake at the same time producing an 
abundant salivation which renders the prey very 
slimy. Several repeated alternate movements of the 
jaws bring the head of the prey to the gullet, where 
the muscles and ribs come into play, and the two 
sides of the jaws work no longer alternately, but 
together. When once in the oesophagus, the prey 
progresses with much greater facility, and usually 
reaches the stomach in a few minutes, whilst the 
previous process of deglutition may have lasted half 
an hour. While this laborious operation is going 
on, the breathing of the snake is not impaired 
owing to a remarkable contrivance: the trachea 
can be protruded in such a manner as to bring its 
opening outside the mouth. 

In cases where the victim is eaten alive, the snake 
has to contend with its struggles, but retrogression is 
rendered impossible by the backwardly-directed 
sharp teeth with which the jaws and palate are beset. 
A frog is usually caught by one of the hind limbs and 
swallowed back-first, the long hind limbs stretching 
forwards as they fold against the body; its struggles 
are often still apparent when it has reached the 
oesophagus. Snakes when caught immediately after 
a meal are in the habit of disgorging their food, and 
it sometimes happens that a frog or toad is thus 
vomited alive. An instance is known of a naturalist 
having captured a Grass-snake and put it in a linen 
bag. On opening it a short time after, great was his 
surprise to find the snake had escaped through a 
small hole in the bag, leaving instead a living toad 
too big to pass through the hole. 

If not of too large a size, several animals will often 
be swallowed in rapid succession, after which the 
gorged snake will allow its digestive organs several 
days, or even weeks, of repose. A large Anaconda in 
the Paris Jardin des Plantes fed only thirty-six times 
in the course of seven years. Digestion is usually 
rapid in the small snakes, defecation taking place 
twenty-four to forty-eight hours after the feeding;
it lasts much longer in the large Boas and Pythons. 
Thus, in the above-mentioned Anaconda it has been 
observed to take from nine to thirty-eight days. 
Even the hardest bones of birds are decomposed by 
the gastric juices, but hairs, feathers, and horny productions, 
are passed with the excrements, sometimes 
forming regular balls. It is in most cases possible to 
tell, from an inspection of the dried faeces, what a 
snake has been feeding on, hairs, feathers, beaks, 
claws, epidermal horny shields, bits of tooth-enamel, 
being found mixed with the chalky matter which 
represents the decomposed bones. As a rule there 
is but one defecation after each meal, but there are 
in addition more frequent renal dejections, consisting 
chiefly of uric acid. 

In captivity snakes show themselves capricious in 
the choice of food, one individual preferring mammals, 
whilst another, of the same species, will 
only take birds ; and many, although to all appearances 
perfectly healthy, will persist in refusing all 
food, and allow themselves to die of starvation: a 
suicide which may require months, or even years, to 
accomplish. A Rattle-snake in the menagerie of the 
Jardin des Plantes in Paris has lived two years and two 
months without taking any food, a Python sebcs nearly 
two years and a half, a Boa madagascariensis four years 
and a month. A Vipera aspis was kept for three 
years without food and without losing its vicious 
temper. Specimens thus fasting do not, as a rule,
renew their epidermis, or do so but very rarely. Our 
Common Adder can very seldom be induced to feed 
in captivity. Other snakes may rid themselves of all 
shyness to the extent of taking food from the hand, 
or show such appetite as to seize a prey immediately 
on being released from the small box or bag in 
which they have travelled for a considerable time. 

Most snakes drink, and pretty often, not by 
lapping with the tongue, but by drawing in water 
from the mouth and immersing the anterior part of 
the head. Some are said to be fond of milk, but 
there is no foundation for the belief held by peasants, 
that they enter sheds with the object of sucking 
milk from the cows, which would be a material im- 
possibility; their real purpose in visiting such places 
being a search for suitable dung-heaps in which to 
deposit their eggs. 

Snakes cannot be credited with much intelligence 
or educability, nor do they display any very marked 
instincts. The least stupid and most easily tamed 
are the species of the genera Coluber and Coronclla. 
There is, however, considerable difference in this 
respect between individuals of the same species. 
Most snakes, when freshly caught, defend themselves 
by biting, and some individuals retain their savage 
temper after months of captivity ; others hardly ever 
bite, even if molested. The Common Grass-snake, 
for instance, hisses loudly and takes up a very 
threatening attitude, or even pretends to snap with 
open mouth, but very seldom bites; its principal 
defensive action when caught consists in voiding a 
most repulsive secretion from its anal glands, which 
it evidently controls, as it ceases doing so when 
accustomed to being handled. The same snake also 
produces, during the spring, an oily exudation from 
the skin which has the same repulsive smell. 
Mr. H. N. Ridley has observed a Malay snake 
Macropisthodon rhodomelas, exuding drops of a white 
viscid liquid from the skin of 
its neck, which is flattened out like that of a Cobra 
when in an attitude of defence, and he noticed that 
his dog, seizing the snake to worry it, foamed at the 
mouth as if he had been biting a toad. 

The hissing is produced by the rapid expulsion of 
air from the lungs through the trachea and the notch 
at the end of the mouth, which is kept shut at the 
time. Snakes provided with an epiglottis  
produce a much louder hissing. Other sounds are 
produced by some snakes. Thus, the Indian and 
African Vipers of the genera Echis and Cerastes make 
a curious, prolonged, rustling noise, by rubbing the 
folds of the sides of the body against one another. 
This sound is produced by friction between the 
serrated keels of the lateral scales, which are disposed 
obliquely with their tips directed downwards 
and backwards; the noise can even be repeated 
after the death of the animal, by twisting the body 
and thus rubbing or rasping these little saws against 
one another. The same thing probably takes place 
in the African genus Dasypeltis, in which we find a 
similar arrangement of the scales, though to a less 
degree. 

The best known sounding apparatus is that of the 
Rattlesnakes. When alarmed, 
these snakes gather the body in a few coils or roll 
themselves up in a spiral, with the tail erect in the 
centre, and vibrating with great rapidity, whilst the 
head is ready for attack. Other snakes, such as the 
Ancistrodon and some species of Coluber and 
Zamenis, when excited, vibrate the tail in the same 
manner; but, being deprived of the sound-producing 
apparatus, this expression of their anger does not 
attract the same attention. It is from such a habit, 
however, that the rattle must have been evolved and 
perfected, not necessarily in a Lamarckian sense, but 
through the different steps by which evolution or 
creation has proceeded; Natura non fecit saltics, as 
Linnaeus well said. Many suggestions have been 
made as to the use of the rattle. One of them is 
that the rattling resembles the sound made by 
locusts, and serves to decoy insect-eating birds; 
another, that it serves to call the sexes together. 
Probably it is useful to the snake as a warning to 
keep off disturbers which cannot serve as food, and 
thus prevents useless expenditure of venom, or even 
the breaking of the fangs. At any rate, it gives expression 
to the snake's excitement, as does the voice 
in the case of many other animals, and it seems 
reasonable to suppose that it may be applied to 
different purposes. With the advent of man, this 
means of attracting attention must tend to the more 
rapid extermination of the snakes which possess it. 

Another curious behaviour is that of feigning death, 
as observed in a harmless but vicious-looking genus of snakes, 
Heterodon, often called Hog-nosed snakes or Puff-adders in America. 
It looks more like a Viper than a harmless snake, and 
when disturbed hisses loudly and flattens out the 
anterior part of the body, much as does a Cobra, and 
pretends to strike, although it is one of the few 
snakes that never bite man. If, however, this display 
proves of no avail in frightening away the intruder, 
the snake rolls on its back and opens its mouth, and 
then lies for a time, which may exceed a quarter of 
an hour, absolutely motionless, as if dead. As soon 
as it thinks the danger over, it awakens from its 
spasm and rapidly moves off. It is the opinion of 
those who have most experience of this snake that 
this extraordinary behaviour is not to be explained 
as a convulsion or faint due to fright, but constitutes 
a deliberate trick to save its life. Individuals of the 
South African Ringhals (Sepedon hmnachates) and of 
the Grass snake Natrix natrix have also been observed to 
feign death. 

The notion that snakes fascinate their prey, 
attracting it or reducing it to immobility by a 
mysterious power in their glittering eyes, is pure
fable. Animals placed in a cage with a snake evince 
no particular fright, and fly away when pursued, if 
not actually turning round to defend themselves. 
It is even dangerous to offer a good-sized snake a 
wild rat for food, as all keepers of menageries know. 

In cold and temperate climates snakes hibernate, 
lying more or less torpid in holes or hollow trees, 
sometimes assembled in numbers and coiled 
together in a mass. The first thing they do in 
awakening in the spring is to cast the outer coating 
of the epidermis, as described above. Several 
exuviations take place during the period of activity, 
sometimes pretty regularly every month, sometimes 
at very irregular intervals. A few days previous to 
this operation the snake is languid and abstains from 
feeding; its skin is dull and the sight impaired by 
the opaque condition of the lid; a day or two before 
moulting, the outer stratum of the epidermis 
becomes again transparent and the eye clear, 
through this stratum becoming detached from the 
subjacent tissue, until it is pulled off in one piece, 
by the snake rubbing itself against stones or bushes. 
The first exuviation takes place very shortly after 
birth. 

Snakes are long-lived, although the limit of dura- 
tion of life is not known in any of them. They grow 
slowly, and do not appear ever to reach sexual 
maturity until the fourth year, when they continue 
increasing in size for a long period. A Python reticulatus 
and an Ancistrodon piscivorus are reported to 
have lived twenty-one years in captivity in Paris. 
The young of many snakes are very secretive, and 
are not often found in the open, those that are met 
with being as a rule either new-born or approaching 
sexual maturity. 

Snakes are tenacious of life, and remarkable for 
the reflex movements which take place after they 
have been cut to pieces, the severed parts of the body 
and tail wriggling for a considerable time, and the 
head endeavouring to bite. Accounts of decapitated 
Rattlesnakes turning round and striking with their 
bloody stumps are probably not snake stories.</text>

&lt;!-- Categories and interwikis go at the bottom of this page. --&gt;

==Usage==
This template is used to present markup or code side by side with the rendered output.

Parameters:
* unnamed 1: Content of row 1, column 1
* unnamed 2: Content of row 1, column 2
:through
* unnamed 39: Content of row 20, column 1
* unnamed 40: Content of row 20, column 2

* '''t1''': Title of column one; defaults to ''Markup''
* '''t2''': Title of column two; defaults to ''Renders as''
* '''title''': Title of table; defaults to none
* '''notitle''': When set, suppresses table and column titles
* '''margin''': set table left margin in em

The ''Markup'' cell is pre-formatted with {{tag|pre|o}} to retain newlines and spaces, but styled to allow content to wrap within the cell. It is usually desirable to escape the content of the ''Markup'' cell so that the markup is displayed by wrapping the markup in {{xtag|nowiki}}. It is technically not possible to add this feature to the template.

In the ''Renders as'' cell, the content is usually the unescaped markup copied from the ''Markup'' cell. There are instances where this may differ:
* If the first line includes wikimarkup that must start on a new line such as #, *  or ; then use {{tl|crlf2}} before the first line; see examples below.
* Header markup such as {{code|1===}} will show in the page table of contents; use {{tlx|fake heading}}.
; See usage at [[w:{{FULLPAGENAME}}]] for examples truncated below. It references or uses templates not here on Wikibooks. 
It is unknown and unevaluated whether the template will function here on Wikibooks. I brought it in because another templates /doc page referred to it as a 'See Also'. // [[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 18:13, 21 March 2014 (UTC)
;Usage below truncated by including {{tl|void} from here to categories tagging.
{{TextBox|1=
:* Half a dozen redlinked template references to import if you care to have a go at the full usage and examples. Me, I'd see the Wikipedia help!  [[w:{{FULLPAGENAME}}]]&lt;br/&gt;
}}
{{void|
* When using {{tlx|reflist}} with no other parameters, use {{tlx|reflist|close}} to ensure that the reference list is closed.
* Some templates will place the page in a maintenance category, which is usually undesired:
** Instead of {{tlx|citation needed}}, use {{tlx|fake citation needed}}.
* Some template may have error checking that places the page in a maintenance category. Suppress the category as possible:
** {{cs1}} templates can suppress the maintenance category by setting {{para|template doc demo|true}}.

==Limitations==
If you don't wrap the content of the markup cell in {{xtag|nowiki}}, then any template markup will not be escaped, it will be expanded.

This example shows the markup for &lt;nowiki&gt;{{tl|tag}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;:

{{markup|t1=Renders as|t2=Expected rendering
|{{tl|tag}}
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tl|tag}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
}}

HTML entities are parsed in the markup cell
{{markup|t1=Nowikied markup shows as |t2=Expected markup
|&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;ndash;
}}

To work around this, replace the &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; thus &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt; will show as &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;

==Examples==

'''Simple examples:'''
{{markup
|&lt;nowiki&gt;'''Bold text'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;|'''Bold text'''
|&lt;nowiki&gt;''Italic text''&lt;/nowiki&gt;|''Italic text''
}}

'''Complex example:'''
Note that the second argument to {{tl2|markup}} uses {{tl2|fake heading}} and {{tl2|fake citation needed}}.
{{markup
|&lt;nowiki&gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.{{#tag:ref|A footnote.&lt;ref&gt;A reference for the footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} The cow jumped over the moon.{{fact}}

==Notes==
{{Reflist|group=nb}}

==References==
{{Reflist}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.{{#tag:ref|A footnote.&lt;ref&gt;A reference for the footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} The cow jumped over the moon.{{fake citation needed}}

{{fake heading|sub=3|Notes}}
{{Reflist|group=nb}}

{{fake heading|sub=3|References}}
{{Reflist|close}}
}}

'''Multiple rows:'''
{{markup
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
}}

'''With title:'''
{{markup|title=Foxes and dogs
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
|The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
}}

When a template is enclosed within {{tl|code}}, it shows the rendered HTML:

{{markup
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite book |last=White |first=T. H. |title=The Book of Merlyn |year=1977}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{cite book |last=White |first=T. H. |title=The Book of Merlyn |year=1977}}
|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{code|{{cite book |last=White |first=T. H. |title=The Book of Merlyn |year=1977}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|{{code|{{cite book |last=White |first=T. H. |title=The Book of Merlyn |year=1977}}}}
}}

{{TRS-warning|BG=yelllow|1=Note, this is nearly but not identical to the Wikipedia template of the same name. This version defaults to group=note versus Wikipedia's default of 'lower-alpha', as does the Wikibook version of {{Tl|efn}} or &quot;Explanatory Foot Note&quot;. 
}}
{{tl|notelist}} creates a section of explanatory notes that were individually specified by {{tl|efn}} tags in the article. This is analogous to the use of long form {{tag|ref name=somename}} and {{tag|references |single}} tags for normal citations. This creates one or a block of tagged notes in a block or section that should be placed above and ahead of any citations or {{tl|reflist}} template. See the whatlinkshere for plenty of examples in the [[Trainz]] Wikibook. 



The {{tl|notelist}} section should generally occur before the references. This is required when the explanatory notes are referenced, otherwise there will be citations errors. Even if the explanatory notes are not referenced, they are probably more likely to be read than the references, and should be nearer to the top of the [[w:MOS:APPENDIX|MOS:APPENDIX]] sections than the &quot;References&quot; section for this reason.

==Usage==
{{code|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{notelist}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

==Parameters==
* Single unnamed parameter:
: column-count: a [[w:natural number|natural number]] specifying fixed columns into which the reference list is to be rendered. Example: &lt;code&gt;|2&lt;/code&gt;.
: column-width: a typographic unit of measurement such as [[w:em (typography)#CSS|em|]], specifying the width for the reference list columns. Example: &lt;code&gt;|30em&lt;/code&gt;.
* '''colwidth''': explicitly sets the column-width.
* '''refs''': used with named references (e.g., {{tag|ref|s|params=name=name}}); it specifies a list of some or all named references used in the article.
* '''group''': '''{{Para|group}}''' Sets the [[w:WP:REFGROUP|group name|]], and needs to be the same as those inline. This defaults to ''lower-alpha''.

The available options are:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! group !! Styled as
|-
| upper-alpha || &lt;sup&gt;[A]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| upper-roman || &lt;sup&gt;[IV]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| lower-alpha || &lt;sup&gt;[a]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| lower-greek || &lt;sup&gt;[a][ß]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| lower-roman || &lt;sup&gt;[iv]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| note || &lt;sup&gt;[note 1]&lt;/sup&gt;
|}
* '''close''': forces the reference list to close and render all references defined to that point; see the [[w:Template:Reflist#Multiple uses|section on multiple uses|]] for details.

==Example==
;See [[w:{{FULLPAGENAME}}]] for working examples.

      <comment>- Speedy, no such IP is not a reason to delete the page</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I wanted to mention that, when I open my MARY.PY file with the IDLE for Python version 2.7.5 and then &quot;Run Module&quot;, I get the following output:

Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece was white as snow;
('and everywhere that Mary went',)
her lamb was sure to go.

I have no idea why those parentheses are still there, since I took the four Print statements exactly as they appear on the Wiki page.

When I launch IDLE for version 3.4 and &quot;Run Module&quot;, I get the following, correct output:

Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece was white as snow;
and everywhere that Mary went
her lamb was sure to go.

***************************************

I'm a beginner at Python, so I haven't a clue as to why those parentheses would continue to appear, although the two versions are apparently treating the set of statements differently.</text>

This template is used when you want a larger bullet than a [[Template:·|bold middot]] ['''&amp;middot;'''], but something smaller than a [&amp;ndash;] or [&amp;mdash;], and FURTHER, want to start a new row of data or bullet a point. For instance, in dotted lists that have a font-size 80% or less of normal font-size, since then a bold middot becomes too small... so we use {{Tl|bull}}, for those of us who don't know how to code such, and know further that searching for graphics dots is slow and painful. (Letters, on the other hand, are easy to find on ALL KEYBOARDS).
&lt;br&gt;
===Tail of two bulls===
* Both the 'bulls' work similarly to the HTML markup sequence: &lt;big&gt;[&lt;code&gt;'''&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;/code&gt;]&lt;/big&gt;, that is, {{Tl|bull}} expresses a &lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;non-breaking space, a bullet and a normal space&lt;/code&gt; ...
&lt;br&gt;
* '''while BullR''' expresses a &lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;'' 'carriage-return-to-indent-column' ''and 'linefeed'&lt;/code&gt; (newline) so changes line then shows the bullet indented to the prior indented column. This is akin to setting a return stop on typewriters when Returning would be stopped short of the left margin. (This kept thousands of secretaries employed laboriously setting up the bosses tabular documents! And that's 'No Bull!')

;to illustrate, indenting the below
:then using it and bull together on the same line:
::When displayed {{tl|bull}} looks like [{{bull}}] on the same line, while THIS looks and acts on a '''term or link''' like this when also on the same line: &lt;br/
&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;'''term or link'''... ''unlike {{tl|bull}}'', '''BullR''' begins a newline but indented. Used together with a bit of planning the two make for some nice navigation template options. Used alone, BullR nicely sets off data best viewed in an uncluttered presentation. 
* And unlike {{Bull}}, the bullet stays attached to the following text separated and linked by the opposite nesting order of HTML markup sequence: &lt;big&gt;[&lt;code&gt;''' &amp;amp;bull;&amp;amp;nbsp;'''term or link&lt;/code&gt;]&lt;/big&gt;. 
* Since it expresses a normal space then the bullet and non-breaking space it makes a handy delimiter when table data gets confusing and you need to set off things in an orderly manner:
&lt;br&gt;
* use after some text like this&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{BullR&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and just continue your composition. Wikimarkup parsing will search until finding the end of template so the newline equates to a tab or space (all class 'whitespace') and all are ignored. 

{{further|Template:bull}}

{{void| So if you want it. you figure out how to rewrite the below... I was out of time three hours ago!

=== Normal usage ===
The recommended usage is to use ''no'' space before the template and one space after the template, like this:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;Salt{{&amp;bull;}} Pepper&lt;/nowiki&gt;

It will render one space on each side of the bullet, like this:
:Salt &amp;bull; Pepper

If it line breaks then the line break will come ''after'' the bullet, not before, like this:
:Salt &amp;bull; 
:Pepper

For long dotted lists, each list item can be put on its own line with no spaces between each item and the template, like this:
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 Salt{{&amp;bull;}}
 Pepper{{&amp;bull;}}
 Curry{{&amp;bull;}}
 Saffron&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

(It does not matter if there are no or some spaces at the end of the lines, after the templates.)

As before it will render one space on each side of the bullets, like this:
:Salt &amp;bull; Pepper &amp;bull; Curry &amp;bull; Saffron

And if it line breaks then the line break will come ''after'' one of the bullets, not before, like this:
:Salt &amp;bull; Pepper &amp;bull; 
:Curry &amp;bull; Saffron

=== Incorrect usage ===
If the template is used slightly wrong, it will, in some cases, still behave well. For instance, if there are no or several spaces after the template, like these examples:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;Salt{{&amp;bull;}}Pepper&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;Salt{{&amp;bull;}}   Pepper&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Both of them will render exactly as before, with just one space on each side of the bullet, like this:
:Salt &amp;bull; Pepper

And it will still only line break ''after'' the bullet, like this:
:Salt &amp;bull; 
:Pepper

But putting one or more spaces before the template will cause problems, like these examples:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;Salt {{&amp;bull;}}Pepper&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;Salt   {{&amp;bull;}}Pepper&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;Salt {{&amp;bull;}} Pepper&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;Salt   {{&amp;bull;}}   Pepper&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Then it will render with ''two'' spaces before the bullet and one after, like this:
:Salt &amp;nbsp;&amp;bull; Pepper

And if it line breaks it might break ''before'' the bullet, like this:
:Salt
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;bull; Pepper

=== Technical details ===
The space before the bullet is a non-breaking space. That means it will not line break and will not collapse together with normal spaces that come before the template.

The space after the bullet is a normal space. That means it wraps (allows line breaks) and it will collapse together with normal spaces that come after the template to form one single space.

Under some circumstances, dotted link lists misbehave. They might get unexpected line wraps or they might expand outside the box they are enclosed in.

The history of humanity is an interesting story. From our starts on fertile river banks to the massive globally linked skyscraper sea we live in today, humanity has woven a tail written by war, politics, religions, technology, and curiosity. As we constantly create history in our ever advancing society, one should look back on the history already created to understand the world today. Much of the concepts in society like politics, business, and military have been shaped by events that happened in history. This comprehensive guide will take you through thousands of years of human history from all over the world. This is not an encyclopedia of historical events and persons, but rather a tour guide through history that aims to show how humanity has advanced. The tour starts now.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Prologue to History ==
There was no time. The was no space. There was simply nothing. The universe was but a state of immense heat and energy, and incredible density. Such a scale of energy and heat that was so compact was the precursor to all history, and by means still not exactly known, the dense state of heat and energy suddenly and rapidly expanded, travailing at a speed barely comprehensible. The Big Bang. Just a mere second after the universe came into existence it was at a temperature of 5.5 billion Celsius (10 billion Fahrenheit). This cosmic plasma soup contained a vast array of fundamental particles such as neutrons, electrons and protons, which as the universe gradually cooled died off. 13.798 ± 0.037 billion BCE. The start of history. Over the next billions of years the universe continued to cool off and expand, even to this day, it is still expanding from the force of the Big Bang. Eventually hydrogen, helium and lithium, created from particles formed by the Big Bang, started to come together to form heaver elements, which would in turn form stars. 

Why does this matter? Why is astronomy history being discussed in a world history wikibook? Because humanity itself is made from the big bang. Carbon-based lifeforms are made up of elements first conceived in the Big Bang. The particles of the early universe are what form our bodies. We are made of star stuff. Further more, the advancement of humanity is also possible only through the formation of the universe. The natural metal and ore deposits on Earth shaped history, as everything from weapons and armor to plows and eating utensils would not be possible if the right elements had not formed in the Big Bang. While obviously in the broad sense the Big Bang created history by creating time itself, the Big Bang contributed all of the necessary conditions and elements for human civilization to arise. People in the past were often fascinated by space and the stars, and rightfully so. Everything we know today came from the stars. Even you, the reader, has portions of the universe from the Big Bang flowing through your veins, beating in your chest. In order to understand and appreciate the proceeding guide through history, it is important to know that all of it was due to a cosmic coincidence that remnants of still can be seen today. Perhaps the amazement with the cosmos is symbiotic, as we continue to study the force that brought us into creation, that force also ever studies us, watching us grow and evolve as our society and civilizations advance. And in that cosmic sense, that is the essence of history

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Typhlops vermicularis''''', the European blind snake or European worm snake, 
[[File:Typhlops vermicularis.jpg|thumbnail|Typhlops vermicularis, the European blind snake or European worm snake]]
is a species of snake in the genus ''[[Snakes_of_Europe/Species/Typhlops|Typhlops]]'', first decribed by Merrem in 1820.   Despite its common name, the range of the European blind snake ranges from the Balkan Peninsula, the Aegean Islands, and Cyprus to Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=Oshea1&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Shea|first=Mark|title=Boas and Pythons of the World|year=2007|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=9781845375447|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common names refer to how it is the only blindsnake of the genus ''Typhlops'' naturally found in Europe.  

==Biology==
Decsribed as growing to 20-35cm in size and being 1cm in diameter.
Unlike most relatives, which are oviparous, this species lays 4-8 eggs. It feeds on insect larvae and ants.

==Identification==
The rostral scale overhangs the mouth to form a shovel-like burrowing structure. They live underground in burrows, and since they have no use for vision, their eyes are mostly vestigial. They have light-detecting black eye spots, and teeth occur in the upper jaw. The tail ends with a horn-like scale. They can often be confused with earthworms as they are both often seen in leaf litter and detritus on the ground, and in the soil.

==Venom and toxicity==
Described as being willing to try to sting with a small spine at the end of its tail &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bayramgocmen.com/hc_snakes.html&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
==Alien species==
The only other blindsnake found in Europe is the Brahminy blindsnake, or &quot;flowerpot snake,&quot; ''Ramphotyphlops braminus'', where specimens have been discovered lurking in the soil at the Kew Gardens, London.&lt;ref name=Oshea2&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Shea|first=Mark|title=Boas and Pythons of the World|year=2007|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=9781845375447|pages=67}}

The '''Typhlopidae''' are a family of blind snakes, first decribed by Merrem in 1820. They are found mostly in the tropical regions of Africa, Asia, the Americas, and all mainland Australia and various islands. The rostral scale overhangs the mouth to form a shovel-like burrowing structure. They live underground in burrows, and since they have no use for vision, their eyes are mostly vestigial. They have light-detecting black eye spots, and teeth occur in the upper jaw. The tail ends with a horn-like scale. Most of these species are oviparous. Currently, 10 genera are recognized containing over 200 species.

==Geographic range==
They are found in most tropical and many subtropical regions all over the world, particularly in Africa, Asia, islands in the Pacific, tropical America, one species is found in  southeastern Europe.

==Species of Interest==
In Europe the only native species is [[Snakes_of_Europe/Species/Typhlops_vermicularis|Typhlops vermicularis, the Blind Snake or Worm Snake]] of the genus [[Snakes_of_Europe/Species/Typhlops|Typhlops]], it is found in southeastern Europe, the Balkans, and islands in the Aegean with distribution stretching across to Afghanistan.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== DR. ESPERANTO’S INTERNATIONAL – ENGLISH VOCABULARY ==

What follows is the original lexicon of Esperanto words as it appeared in ''Dr. Esperanto's International Language'' published in 1889. It is from this original stock of approximately 600 words that the language grew. The pamphlet contained the following note about Esperanto word-building:

:''Everything written in the international language can be translated by means of this vocabulary. If several words are required to express one idea they must be written in one, but separated by [apostrophes]; e.g., frat'in'o, though one idea, is yet composed of three words, which must be looked for separately in the vocabulary.''

The requirement for internal punctuation of a word was dropped from the language not long after this work was published. It is now vanishingly rare to find it in use except in the most rudimentary of primers.

Esperanto is a living language and, like all living languages, the meanings of words drift over time. Herein are the original definitions as they are found in Zamenhof's pamphlet.

      <comment>/* Abbreviations */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Many advanced typesetting tools, such as [[w:LaTeX|LaTeX]] have support for Esperanto documents. In general there are only a few simple rules to remember:

== Abbreviations ==

In Esperanto, unlike English, words are most commonly abbreviated by means of a hyphen; an em-dash should never be used for this purpose. Consider the following common Esperanto abbreviation ''Ges-roj'' (Mr. and Mrs.): in plain text a hyphen is used to indicate an abbreviation. However, a properly typeset document will use ''Ges&lt;sup&gt;roj&lt;/sup&gt;''. Handwritten documents may either use a hyphen or may superscript and underline similar to the way ordinal numbers are often handwritten in English e.g., 2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;nd&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. So, written with a pen one might see ''Ges&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;roj&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;'' for clarity, but abbreviations should never be typeset with an underline in this way.

== Acronyms ==

Acronyms that are not mixed case, such as ''ktp'' (et cetera) should simply be italicized. If italics is not available, the word should include periods, k.t.p.

Acronyms that are mixed case such as ''a.K.E.'' (BCE) should be in small caps ({{Smallcaps|aKE}}) if at all possible. 

== Miscellaneous Rules ==

In Esperanto, as in English, untranslated words from foreign languages should be italicized. Words from non-Roman alphabets should be transliterated and then italicized. For example a document containing {{hebrew|שׁ}} might read &quot;{{hebrew|שׁ}} (''ŝin.'')&quot;</text>

==Introduction==
[[File:Marsha Coleman-Adebayo.jpg|thumb|Marsha Coleman-Adebayo]]
Dr. Marsha Coleman-Adebayo graduated with a doctorial degree from [[w:Massachusetts Institute of Technology | Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt; NPR Staff. (2011, September 06) High Price of Blowing the Whistle on EPA. http://www.npr.org/2011/09/06/140214594/high-price-of-blowing-the-whistle-on-epa &lt;/ref&gt; After leaving MIT she began working for the United Nations where she learned about African developmental issues. &lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot; /&gt;  In 1990, she joined the Environmental Protection Agency ([[W:United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]) and became a Senior Policy Analyst in the Office of the Administrator. &lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot; /&gt; &lt;ref&gt; The No FEAR Institute. Dr. Marsha Coleman-Adebayo Biography.  http://thenofearinstitute.wordpress.com/about/dr-marsha-coleman-adebayo-biography/ &lt;/ref&gt; During her time at the EPA, she traveled to South Africa where she was exposed to the horrors of vanadium poisoning that many South African mine workers were facing. Back in the United States, she reported this issue to the EPA but was ignored. She felt that she was being ignored because of her race and gender. She became a [[w:whistleblower | whistleblower]] when she decided to sue the EPA for discriminating against her.  Like other well known whistleblowers, including [[W:Edward Snowden|Edward Snowden]] and [[W:Chelsea Manning|Chelsea Manning]], her actions have faced mixed reviews as she was ridiculed and allegedly continued to be discrimination against for the remainder of her career at the EPA.

==Vanadium Mining and the Binational Commission==
[[File:Vanadium crystal elektrolytic.jpg|thumb|left|Vanadium crystal elektrolytic]]
In 1995, after [[w: Nelson Mandela | Nelson Mandela]] became the president of South Africa, the United States offered $210-million in support to the newly formed democracy and created the U.S.-South Africa Binational Commission. &lt;ref name=&quot;Stremlau&quot;&gt; Stremlau, J. (2000, July/August). Ending Africa's wars. Foreign Affairs, 79(4), 117-132. JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman-Adebayo represented the EPA as the commission's executive secretary. &lt;ref name =&quot;no fear&quot;&gt;Coleman-Adebayo, M. (September, 2011). ''No fear: A whistleblower's triumph over corruption and retaliation at the EPA.'' Chicago, IL: Lawrence Hill Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The commission, led by then U.S. Vice President [[w: Al Gore |Al Gore]] and South African Deputy President [[w: Thabo Mbeki | Thabo Mbeki]], met twice a year to discuss education, agriculture, defense, and trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stremlau&quot;/&gt; One resource the United States imports heavily from South Africa is vanadium. South Africa has the world's largest supply of vanadium and there were several American-run mines in the country. &lt;ref&gt; Rotberg, R. (1980). Suffer the future, policy choices in South Africa. Harvard University Press. &lt;/ref&gt; At one American mine, Vametco, workers were dying from vanadium poisoning and children and elderly nearby reported respiratory illness. &lt;ref&gt; The South African Exchange Program on Environmental Justice. (1995, November 19). Protest at the headquarters of Strategic Minerals Corporation. http://saepej.igc.org/&lt;/ref&gt; During Coleman-Adebayo's trips to South Africa, she witnessed first-hand the effects of vanadium mining on the South African people.&lt;ref name =&quot;no fear&quot;/&gt; She reported the problems to the EPA, but her superior told her to shut up. Coleman-Adebayo believes the EPA wouldn't listen to her because they discriminated against her. &lt;ref name=&quot;no fear&quot;/&gt;

==Discrimination==

Marsha Coleman-Adebayo was allegedly faced with discrimination due to her sex, race, and health. After returning from maternity leave, a white man with less experience became her boss - a position she originally wanted. After complaining, she was told: &quot;You're an intelligent woman; you knew not to get pregnant. How can you make that decision and expect to compete with men?&quot; In 1992, after entering a meeting she was told: &quot;Come on in, Marsha. We'll make you an honorary white man so you can join us.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;root&quot;&gt; Gordy, Cynthia. (2011, November 3) The High Cost of Being an EPA Whistleblower. The Root. &lt;/ref&gt; Another supervisor also called her &quot;uppity,&quot; a term that has racial connotations. &lt;ref name=&quot;fears&quot;&gt; Fears, D. (2006, July 10) Coming soon: A tale of whistle-blowing at the EPA. ''The Washington Post'' &lt;/ref&gt; After she told the EPA about the vanadium mines, her supervisor believed she was identifying too closely with the black South Africans and thus needed to understand &quot;which team [she] was on.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;root&quot; /&gt;

Coleman-Adebayo brought up the discrimination to others within the EPA, but she was faced with threats towards herself and her family. She received a graphic rape threat on her secure cell phone. Two people called insinuating a threat to her children as they provided information about her children such as them playing in her front house.  &lt;ref&gt; Buford, L. (2011, October1 18) EUR Book Look: 'No Fear: A Whistleblower's Triumph Over Corruption and Realiation at the EPA.' eurweb. &lt;/ref&gt; The EPA has refused to comment on Coleman-Adebayo's specific allegations, but Jennifer Wood, an EPA spokesperson, denies that the &quot;EPA has discriminated or retaliated against Dr. Coleman-Adebayo.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;fears&quot;/&gt;

==Whistleblowing against Discrimination==
[[File:Environmental Protection Agency logo.svg|thumb|left| Environmental Protection Agency]]
In 1998, Marsha Coleman-Adebayo filed a law suit against the EPA. Coleman-Adebayo claimed that Carol Browner, the EPA administrator at the time, allowed discrimination to persist in the office rather than trying to eliminate it. At the congressional hearing on the matter, Browner's defense was that minorities in senior ranking positions had tripled in number during her time, but she was unable to explain why the culprits of Coleman-Adebayo's claims had not been reprimanded or dismissed. In some cases they had actually been promoted. The jury found the EPA guilty of discrimination and awarded Coleman-Adebayo $300,000. As word of Coleman-Adebayo's case spread, other minority EPA workers came forward with claims of discrimination. One African-American woman said that she was ordered to clean a toilet in anticipation of Browner's arrival at an event. &lt;ref&gt; White, Jack. (Feb. 23, 2001). How the EPA was Made to Clean Up its Own Stain-Racism. Time. http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,100423,00.html &lt;/ref&gt;


Coleman-Adebayo continued fighting the EPA. Between 1998 and 2011 Coleman-Adebayo filed nine civil suits against the EPA for job discrimination and civil rights violations. She sued specific members of the EPA and the organization as a whole. &lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg Law. (2014, April 2). Search results for Coleman-Adebayo&lt;/ref&gt; After her initial suit, Coleman-Adebayo developed [[w: hypertension | hypertension]] and the EPA asked her to resign. It is unclear whether the EPA asked her to resign because of her lawsuit or her medical condition, but she refused because the men who had discriminated against her were allowed to stay. The EPA allowed her to work from home until she was demoted to an in office analyst position in December 2004. She continued to work from home until the EPA eventually ordered her into the office in April 2006. She reluctantly complied but was taken away in an ambulance after she became extremely dizzy. Coleman-Adebayo was placed on unpaid leave. &lt;ref name=&quot;fears&quot;/&gt;

====No FEAR Act====
In addition to the numerous law suits, Coleman-Adebayo took her case to legislation and spearheaded a law to protect whistleblowers. The Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act ([[W:No-Fear Act|No FEAR Act]]) was introduced to the United States Congress on January 3, 2001 and signed into law by President [[w: George W. Bush | George W. Bush]] on May 15, 2002. &lt;ref&gt; United States Congress. (2002). Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002.

ProQuest Legislative Insight. http://congressional.proquest.com/legisinsight?id=PL107-174&amp;type=LEG_HIST &lt;/ref&gt; The Act is based on Congress's findings that &quot;Federal agencies cannot be run effectively if those agencies practice or tolerate discrimination.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002, 5 USCS § 2301. &lt;/ref&gt; The Act requires that Federal agencies provide annual notices to employees about the rights and remedies available under employment discrimination and whistleblower protection laws, train employees at least every two years about those rights and remedies, and submit  annual reports to Congress, the [[W:Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], the [[W: United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], and the [[W: United States Office of Personnel Management| Office of Personnel Management]] outlining the agency's efforts to eliminate discrimination and promote whistleblower protection. Agencies must also detail complaints brought up against them, post on their public website quarterly statistical data about complaints filed with the agency, and reimburse the Judgment Fund for payments made to employees because of violations of discrimination laws, whistleblower protection laws, and retaliation claims. &lt;ref&gt; U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. (2014). Questions and Answers: No FEAR Act. http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/nofear/qanda.cfm &lt;/ref&gt;

====Impacts of the Act====
The Act makes information readily available to the public about discrimination claims filed within Federal agencies. For instance, the [[w: United States Department of Homeland Security | Department of Homeland Security's]] (DHS) report for the 2012 fiscal year reports that 185 civil action cases were filed against them under the No FEAR Act; 85 of those cases were disposed, 68 were decided in favor of the department, 12 were settled, and 5 were sent to mediation. The DHS reimbursed the Judgment Fund $1,528,139. Also, the DHS reports that zero employees were disciplined for discrimination.&lt;ref&gt; Department of Homeland Security. (2012) No FEAR Act Annual Report. http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CRCL/no-fear-act-annual-report-fy2012.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Energy summarizes their complaint activity over several fiscal years; 65 complaints were filed in 2007, 50 in 2008, 49 in 2009, 61 in 2010, and 68 in 2011. &lt;ref&gt; U.S. Department of Energy. (2011). No Fear Act. http://energy.gov/diversity/services/protecting-civil-rights/no-fear-act &lt;/ref&gt; These are just two examples of how agencies are now detailing their actions due to the regulations of the No FEAR Act; however, no analysis has been conducted to determine the effectiveness of the No FEAR Act.

====No FEAR Institute, Coalition and Book====
Passing a law was not the end for Coleman-Adebayo. She started the No FEAR Institute, a non profit organization committed to education and defense of victims of employer discrimination. &lt;ref name =&quot;No FEAR Institute&quot;&gt; The NO FEAR Institute. http://thenofearinstitute.wordpress.com/about/ &lt;/ref&gt; She founded the No FEAR Coalition, a group of civil rights and whistleblower organizations. &lt;ref name=&quot;No FEAR Institute&quot; /&gt; In 2011, she published a memoir titled ''No Fear: A whistleblower's triumph over corruption and retaliation at the EPA''. &lt;ref&gt; Amazon.com No Fear: A whistleblower's triumph over corruption and retaliation at the EPA. http://www.amazon.com/No-Fear-Whistleblowers-Corruption-Retaliation/dp/B007MXDR8K &lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Coleman-Adebayo serves on the board of the National Whistleblowers Center ([[W:National Whistleblowers Center|NWC]]). &lt;ref&gt; National Whistleblowers Center (2012) Board. http://www.whistleblowers.org/index.php?option=com_advancedtags&amp;view=tag&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional and Ethical Considerations==
Are all whistleblowers professionals? Are all professionals whistleblowers? An important quality of a professional is defiance when defiance is necessary. Whistleblowers, in general, may be considered professionals if their defiance is deemed necessary. Marsha Coleman-Adebayo blew the whistle and exposed the EPA for discrimination based on gender and race. Her actions led to may positive changes including the No FEAR Act, but it seems she may have lost sight of her original missions - aiding the South African miners. Some improvements to the mines were made such as having miner uniforms washed at the mine, decreasing the amount of vanadium miners bring into houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;root&quot; /&gt; The EPA also issued a Toxicological Review of Vanadium Pentoxide on September 30, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanadium review&quot;&gt; EPA. IRIS Toxicological Review of Vanadium Pentoxide. http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris_drafts/recordisplay.cfm?deid=236587 &lt;/ref&gt; This review assessed the vanadium oral reference dose, inhalation reference concentration, inhalation unit risk, and cancer weight of evidence descriptor. &lt;ref name=&quot;vanadium review&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These were minor changes and none of them were done through Coleman-Adebayo. Her initial whisteblowing may have been necessary in order to raise questions about the EPA's alleged discriminatory practices, but Coleman-Adebayo could have stopped after her initial civil victory. She, instead, chose to continue fighting and write a book. While her career at EPA suffered as a result of the whistleblowing, the attention she gained afterwards has given her fame and success outside of the EPA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{AM&amp;C-top|refs2=1}}
==Purpose==
This Book Division index page is a master '''&lt;u&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/u&gt;''' page for Intermediate Skills building topics just as Introductory Trainz linked above is for those just getting their feet onto the first slopes of the various Trainz learning curves, and Content Creation and References are for even more advance topics. If the reader visualizes a large reference work in a three ring binder with TABS sticking out to quickly switch between book sections, you see what we're trying to accomplish in your minds eye.
 
At the file structure level, some threaded materials will be linked both in-sequence (threaded page to page 1st to next page) and in collections of related material where it was relocated into various places such as '''[[Trainz/Appendices|Trainz Wikibook Appendix pages]]''', or other divisions of the Trainz Wikibooks. Consequenly, if you've seen such a page, with a slightly different look the chances are you have&amp;mdash;the magic of modern type setting technology in a Wiki allows that page to appear both ways! These Division TOC pages will also introduce new and older Trainzers to that of organization of the work, and give a greater sense of where to look for things when needed.

==Introduction==
Welcome to the '''Trainz Asset and Creation''' TABLE OF CONTENTS page. In here we will be listing beginner to intermediate level stand-alone and threaded tutorial topics so the newer Trainzer can better focus on Fundamentals, then grow in knowledge by using some of this Chapter when its the right time, or browse on a pick and choose basis.
{{Trainz-stub-section}}
In this work we will introduce the Trainz data structures that you will become familiar with once you download older content and routes that may have dependencies which are out of date. Trainz DLS clean-up is an ongoing work, and there is also some stuff that is less than professional grade put up by novices or as a joke by juveniles. Navigating such a situation is a key skill these pages will help you master.

== Altering Assets==
===Fixing Faulty Content===
All content is not treated equally. This prejudicial attitude is evinced by Trainz against the unwary by means of using the {{TR|T|trainz-build}} number to process data differently on reading it's data. Essentially, every older asset gets translated into a newer data model in Trainz internally. When the data can't be, or because the programmers choose to not ignore some data tag and field, errors are generated by the newer Trainz releases.
{{TrainzTip|
:''Editor's note: Some errors occur in later releases because the Trainz data model changed in the release.
* This many times avoidable'' 'Obsoleted by Program Changes' situation ''is the case now for some {{TR|ST|p=tags}} ''if content is upgraded'', but was very noticeable in Steam Locomotives brought forward into TC3 and TS2009's new data models (when they didn't work) and the parade of new errors messages continue with new levels of error checking at each release.}}

== Asset Fundamentals and Management ==
{{TrainzTip|''Main pages: {{TL|Introduction to assets}} and {{TL|Getting and organizing 3rd-party assets}}''
If you are a new Trainz user, the two links above leads into the first page-linked chapters&amp;mdash; each as part of a set of linked 'How-To' (''and be careful of this or that'') pages, and so both page sequences should be read first. We're even going to throw in pictures now and then.{{bullR
}}The Table of Contents lists below will help you find things easy when you want to revisit a page.&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;}}

===Manage, not reorganize===
Managing your assets becomes essential when your 3rd party and DLS content begins to build up. With more than 250,000 items available from the DLS, and built-in content shipped with every edition, the amount of faulty/missing dependencies or items requiring updates or attention quickly becomes a mammoth task to deal with.
{{TrainzTip|New users are cautioned in the strongest possible terms to limit your greed to just a few non-built-in items ''at first'' and especially to just one route at a time&amp;mdash;these can bring in hundreds of assets, many of them older and broken for immediate use. It is better by far to search for sessions so you get a route with some canned Driver sessions. We're going to cover all that, including perils and pitfalls, and once we pass along some tricks, we'll cut you loose to make your mistakes plenty soon enough.
* If you are very new, limit yourself to routes v-2.9 or later until you get some practice fixing various errors. You will get enough in even new routes, and part of this book is going to introduce you to Surveyor and Driver by way of downloading some content to learn from and by ''do-to-learn-fast'' tautology.
* Any asset not fixed, should be disabled before running Trainz GUI programs using the {{kp|RMBHd}} drop down menu. 
:* This cautionary practice extends especially to disabling software (dependent routes or sessions) as TADdaemon gets hyper-active when it can't resolve dependency references.&lt;ref&gt;{{plain link|http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showthread.php?110703-TS12-SP1-HF4-validation-validation-validation-so-when-can-I-get-to-use-the-sim|so-when-can-I-get-to-use-the-sim}}, accessdate=2014-0402.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before tackling the below==
Trainz is an application with many parts, so this whole collection of topics has to assume you've read and mastered the following:

# {{TL|Installing Trainz for convenience}}
# {{TL|Upgrading Trainz within a version}} - Newer Trainz will auto-upgrade but politely ask you first. This can take a while, so running a first Driver session and getting your feet wet is okay. In this, we'll cover both cases (you told it yes or no... what next to upgrade?) and discuss manual patches, resources and so forth.
# You've at least completed three or more {{TL|Driver/Driving Tutorials|Driver Tutorials}}
# You've read {{TL|Intro to Content Manager}} and played around with setting filters
## Can find stuff that's built-in or only on the DLS, or stuff in both, can search for routes, sessions, and stuff by a particular {{TA|Recommended Content Creators for New Trainzers|Content Creator}}.
## Further, you've seen {{TA|New Trainzer's Content Guide}} or {{TA|Content Creators to Avoid}}

;usage &amp; purpose
This template is for adding auto-categorization to [[:Category:Trainz Basic Knowledge references]]&lt;!--  N3V wiki's ---&gt; and [[:Category:Both Trainz fundamentals &amp; refs]] as a Trainz Fundamental or Basic Knowledge page with a less long winded template call. 

* It's primary use is as a supplement to reference pages that should also be listed as  a fundamentals page for ease of new user navigation.

* It is a non-mbox form of auto-categorization templates.

* It should not be used on non-terminology articles that cover in-depth technical data types such as KIND and container pages.

&lt;br /&gt;
Project implemented by  [http://www.y-peer.net/ Y-Peers] &lt;br /&gt;
Lebanon , October 2010 &lt;br /&gt;
UNFPA, [http://www.unfpa.org.lb/UNFPA.aspx The United Nations Population Fund - Lebanon]

----

Baalbek is the administrative headquarters of the Bekaa valley that runs parallel to Lebanon’s border with Syria. It is a small city with a history of more than 5000 years. Two thousand years ago, the magnificent sanctuary of Baalbek celebrated the syncretism between Baal, the God of semitic origin and Zeus-Jupiter, the Gods of Greco-Roman origin. Baalbek was also called Heliopolis, the city of the Sun. Here, we find the largest and best preserved temples of the old Roman Empire. The present population of the town is predominantly Shia muslim but there is an important Christian minority representing the most ancient uninterrupted communities of Christianity.
 
We visited a project in Baalbek, on sexual and reproductive health awareness amongst youth, funded by the United Nations Population Fund and implemented by the Youth Peer Education Network, an organisation that educates youth, especially adolescent girls, on the prevention of HIV/AIDS, drug abuse, and violence against women. In order to inform youth about the risks and causes of sexually transmitted infections, this project utilises innovative communication techniques like theatre, role play, games, radio and television shows.
It is not easy to talk openly about sexual health in this traditional context but the project has been successful in overcoming inhibitions and stereotypes. 

-----
The Youth Peer Education Network or Y-PEER, is a global initiative pioneered by the United Nations Population Fund, spanning 48 countries across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Africa, the Pacific, Middle East, and Latin America. 
In Lebanon, the Y-PEER network comprises peer educators affiliated to NGOs, youth clubs, Scouts, municipalities, private and public schools and 7 Palestinian camps. 

The Y-PEER network was created to enhance awareness amongst youth on reproductive health and to build their capacities in educating their peer groups on issues around adolescent sexual health, youth rights, HIV/AIDS prevention and addressing social stigmas, substance abuse, gender equality and gender based violence, civic engagement, advocacy. 

Through innovative techniques of “edutainment”, or education by entertainment, like theatre, role play, interactive media, games, movies, singing, skills and capacities are built among youth in educating their peer groups and advocating for their rights. Youth sensitize their peers through radio and television shows, conveying messages in events, producing newsletters, and handbooks with practical information, for instance on sexually transmitted infections.

Young people supported as part of this initiative are reaching out and educating thousands of Lebanese youth across the country on HIV/AIDS, STIs and reproductive health care .

This template is used on Wikibook [[Trainz]] for Trainz screenshots that don't contain enough panorama content to be uploaded to the Commons using the [[commons:Category:Trainz templates|Trainz (licensing) templates]] templates.
* It can also be used for other non-free or non-open-source Windows or MAC (OS-X) supporting applications that are not free of proscribed icons and other constrained elements under international copyrights laws and conventions.&lt;br&gt;
* If the page *e.g shows part of a Windows Desktop and icons or Notepad/Word etc. define the Msoft parameter to any value &lt;code&gt;'|MSsoft=1'&lt;/code&gt;.
;When to apply
* Use this licensing template when the image is non-free but educational. Most {{TL|CM}} screen shots will be in this classification.
* If after uploading, auto-page creation adds the two included templates, edit the page and remove them while replacing with this one.
* This template fills in boilerplate for you easing uploading chores the other fields can be provided but may not be needed...
:# define 'module=' or 'use=' parameter if known, but with sub-page reofganizing, best to leave the boilplate. The image and a search will locate which module.

Dear Xania,

May I know why you delete all my pages for the above title at 22:53, 18 December 2011?

I know I have offended the copyright issue, but I already done the edit part which is not directly take from the http://www.thinkgrid.com/cloud-computing.aspx. I edit the pages so many times but end up still have the copyright issues. In addition,I had made some references stating that i have took some words from this web pages. Would'nt you just delete the part which I have offended the copyright part instead of all the part in that pages. This is my group assignments and I do not want to be the black sheep to ruin it. Tomorrow is my presentation for this assignment and I hope u will reply me urgently,
Thanks,

:Xania appears to be on his Xmas break, but you can request undeletion of deleted pages [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion#Undeletion|here]]. (Please log in to your account and click on &quot;Add a new entry&quot; in the &quot;Undeletion&quot; section.) [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 15:49, 21 December 2011 (UTC)

Xania, can you please explain why you've deleted the entire page of &quot;A Bit History of Internet/Chapter 7 : Cloud-computing&quot; by giving reason there was no response after few weeks but actually there was already response regarding the issue?  Could you just delete the copyright violating section(s) but not the entire page?  It seems to me what you are doing can discourage a new potential wiki contributor.  Please restore the deleted page, thanks in advance.

:The page has already been recreated.  I don't understand what the problem is now.  See [[A_Bit_History_of_Internet/Chapter_7_:_Cloud-computing]].  The section for this page on [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion]] explains that we can't see any trace of a response to the original problem and that is why the page was deleted.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:05, 12 January 2012 (UTC)

Sorry about the block, I thought it was a vandal blanking your talk page. I unblocked it now. Sorry again. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:28, 20 August 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' because I think the book should be deleted. Content is poor and likely of little interest to users. Votes for deletion should be based on your opinion of the book.

&quot;I think the book should be deleted&quot; is not a reason, or it is the most generic reason there is, one that provides no basis for discussion and rational decision making. I for one am glad that Wikibooks has &quot;descended into the mess&quot;. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 09:10, 27 April 2009 (UTC)

== DTFT table ==

Hey Xania,

the DTFT table is wrong indeed.  The DTFT transfers into the periodic frequency domain.  The signals shown in the table are not periodic, and hence they are obviously wrong.  The table seems to list ordinary Fourier transforms for angular frequency, which coincidentally also uses the greek letter &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, although with a different meaning.  This confused the author who apparently copied the table from some book without understanding what he or she did.  I will not revert the page again, but I hope that it is eighter removed, or corrected.

Regards,

== Wikijunior ==

Hello Xania,

Thank you for the welcome message! Just from the start, I have two questions:
* Are there any naming conventions for templates? If I make a template for Wikijunior, should it be in the Wikijunior namespace, and if I make a template for use only in a specific book (like [[Template:Small numbers/Table]] for [[Wikijunior:Small Numbers]]), should it have book title in its name? 
* I can't quite understand what is the current preferred method of adding new books to Wikijunior. On one hand, [[Wikijunior:New_Title_Policy]] says that the title with some description should be first submitted to [[Wikijunior:New Title Suggestions]]; but there's a big banner on that page saying &quot;Currently, the process of voting for new books is not used.&quot; So, does it mean that I can add any book I want, but only to [[Wikijunior/Non-Canonical_Books]]?? I am somewhat lost...

Thanks in advance, [[User:Ashaio|Ashaio]] ([[User talk:Ashaio|talk]]) 11:44, 6 November 2009 (UTC)

== Simple English Wikibooks ==

Hello. There seems to be a conflict of interest regarding the closure of Simple Wikibooks thats occuring right now. As we both know, the tally is at 45 yeas to 17 nos, the same as it was when the proposal for closure was finished. You voted after the discussion had been closed. I'm sorry but after the discussion is closed, no one else can vote. '''You are entitled to your opinions, but you cannot deliberately change the situation to satisfy what you want.''' You don't control Wikimedia and MediaWiki, only a community consensus can rule the outcome. You claimed that there was no consensus, however a 45-17 vote is a 72.5% support for closure, a firm consensus in most cases. I want to hear your side of your opinions so we can work this out. I always [[WB:AGF|assume good faith]] in other users, but saying ''&quot;allowing rabbits to vote for the slaughter of beetles&quot;'' isn't very constructive or civil. I'm sorry if you're not happy with the results, but what was done is done. Regards, [[User:Slipknot1|Slipknot1]] ([[User talk:Slipknot1|talk]]) 05:52, 16 January 2010 (UTC)

=== No consensus ===
:''The following discussion has been transfered from [[meta:User talk:Snake311|meta]] to a more appropriate talk page.''

You closed the vote on Simple English Wikibooks.  There is no consensus in this vote.  The vote hasn't been publicised on other Simple English projects and opinions against the closure have been ignored yet no further reasoning has been asked from those voting in support of the proposal.--[[User:Xania|Xania]] 23:47, 14 January 2010 (UTC)
:The other Simple English projects have been notified when the proposal was started. [http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Simple_talk&amp;diff=1611187&amp;oldid=1610919 See here,][http://simple.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Wiktionary:Simple_talk&amp;diff=82675&amp;oldid=82481 here,][http://simple.wikiquote.org/wiki/Wikiquote:Simple_talk/Archive_3#Simple_English_Wikibooks_proposed_closure and here.] Additionally many users who edit simple wikibooks are regulars in all the Simple english projects, and they are well aware of the proposal for closure. Some of the users who supported the project's closure are former or current admins/crats from simple wikibooks. If you are asking about consensus it seems pretty obvious. 45 users supported its closure, and 17 opposed. Mathematically that would be 72.5% in support. So the consensus would be leaning in favor for closing. Before I closed the discussion, two former admins of the project commented why the proposal has not been closed yet. I decided to make a bold move in good faith and did the honors for them. If you feel that you might want to discuss this with other users, you may voice your opinion in the comments section. Thanks, —[[Special:Emailuser/Snake311|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;§&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User:Snake311|stay]] ([[User talk:Snake311|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''sic'''&lt;/span&gt;]])! 01:10, 15 January 2010 (UTC)
:I voiced my opinion in the comments part of the vote page and then you reverted me stating 'discussion is closed'!!! Are you having a laugh?  In your post above (4 lines above) you clearly say to discuss this in the comments section yet when I did this you revert me!!  I have now reverted it back again.  Oh and consensus includes considering all opinions and not just the percentages.  People supporting a deletion of a project with the comment that &quot;it can always be restarted in the future&quot; when this is clearly not possible because Simple language will no longer be approved is a serious flaw in that persons vote for the project's deletion.--[[User:Xania|Xania]] 02:16, 19 January 2010 (UTC)
::First and foremost, that is not the comments section. That is the lead where the nominator explains his/her reasons for requesting closure. What you are looking for is [[meta:Proposals for closing projects/Closure of Simple English Wikibooks (3)#Comments|down here]]. LOL. Also your comments sounded more like a biased speech directed to a developer demanding not to close the project rather than providing reasonable explanations to why it shouldn't be closed. However since you deeply insist that it remain there, I'll leave it. The discussion is over and pretty much people have or will start to forget about it. I have monitored and watched that discussion progress since Day 1 it was opened and read all the supports and opposes there were. There is no doubt that the project will never be reopened once closed, but I'm afraid it is too late to change that. Just because you don't agree with someone's vote doesn't mean it is invalid (unless voting after the discussion has been finished). All registered users are allowed to vote. —[[Special:Emailuser/Slipknot1|&lt;span style=&quot;color:darkgreen&quot;&gt;§&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User:Slipknot1|&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple&quot;&gt;stay&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;big&gt;([[User talk:Slipknot1|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;'''sic'''&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/big&gt;! 09:47, 19 January 2010 (UTC)

== Your neutral vote for my stewardship ==

Hello Xania, and thanks for not opposing me so far. I just want you to know, I do not try to come out as one being able to speak many languages. As you can see from my [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stewards/elections_2010/statements/EivindJ&amp;diff=1819622&amp;oldid=1819620 original statement], I only mention &quot;no&quot; as a fluent language, and that &quot;no&quot; is mutually intelligble with &quot;da&quot; and &quot;sv&quot;. For some reason, they didn't want it to be written like that, so someone changed it later to &quot;no, da, sv&quot;. --[[User:EivindJ|EivindJ]] ([[User talk:EivindJ|talk]]) 08:34, 8 February 2010 (UTC)

== I bringing it here since the thread is huge ==
I request that you careful examine what is on the table, preserving the status quo would be worst that any change, even if I agree that the new features aren't a game changer, the softening of the impact of FlaggedRev would be beneficial.&lt;br&gt;
My initial position is that FlaggedRev should be dropped but since support for that idea wouldn't be sufficient the proposed change would address the most obvious problems.  In any case your stated position only holds a generalization not a specific reason for the objection.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:17, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

Since others have engaged you there on the same issue, please reply to them. We will not require a separated thread here...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:48, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

:I would like to second that. Your vote and your reason for the vote are irreconcilably opposite. The proposal lessens the emphasis on FlaggedRevs and paves the way for their removal. We may find the proposed configuration useful for fighting vandalism if editors and admins become a team, otherwise it will just fall by the wayside. So please change either your vote or your reason as they make no sense together. Thanks, cheers. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 01:44, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

::How would you like it if the next time you voted in a general election that some annoying person came along insisting that you change your vote?  Of course &quot;it's not a vote&quot;, etc., etc..  I voted oppose because I wanted to.  I am sick and tired of long-winded discussions which go on forever and end up being discussed by fewer and fewer people because others just can't be bothered any longer.  This is not how Wikibooks or any Wiki is supposed to be run.  Why aren't you trying to engage the readers rather than satisfying the needs of long-term, frequent editors?  I voted NO because I don't want any more discussions, no more undemocratic policies and because I refuse to be pressurized by a small minority who seem to think that they're in charge.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:25, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

:::I do think that things have changed. As for endless discussions there is nothing we can do about that, it is a requirement just to prevent an active minority decision, an attempt to compromise with fringe views must be made.&lt;s&gt; Please do look at the proposal and provide us a reason for the objection that we can work on.&lt;/s&gt;

== Muggles' Guide edit approvals ==

Hello, Xania. You may have seen me around, I'm one of the two main editors on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]].

Twice today I've found that you have approved edits in MG that should never have been approved. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Filius_Flitwick&amp;curid=55007&amp;diff=2169835&amp;oldid=2018754 This edit] answered a study question facetiously; we don't generally answer the study questions, which are left in order to foster thought in the readers, and this answer actually seems to suggest prejudice on the part of the book's characters. And [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Major_Events/Fred_Weasley%27s_Death&amp;curid=135901&amp;diff=2170063&amp;oldid=2151053 this edit] adds an ungrammatical question, totally unrelated to the page topic, and pointless to boot. You seem to have approved both of these edits. Is there a reason why? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:40, 19 September 2011 (UTC)

: I approve edits which are obviously not vandalism and check them for general grammar consistency.  I have no knowledge of Harry Potter whatsoever so any approved edits for that book are not in the context of that book and I'd expect those who contribute to the Muggles book to review edits more thoroughly.  The added questions of &quot;What's so bad about a death eater in Harry Potter?&quot; appeared to be grammatically correct on first sight especially as I have no idea what a death eater is.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:19, 20 September 2011 (UTC)

::Noted. I am not sure I agree with your policy of re-approving at the previous level, e.g. inserting a sentence with no capitalization (not &quot;What's so bad about a death eater in Harry Potter?&quot; but &quot;whats so bad about a death eater in harry potter?&quot;) into a previously &quot;good&quot; article does not necessarily leave the article at &quot;good,&quot; and it might be more appropriate to re-approve the article at the &quot;minimal&quot; level to assist other editors in tracking such changes. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:49, 20 September 2011 (UTC)
:::I DID approve the article at ''minimum'' level.  I very rarely rate anything other than minimum because I don't have the time to go through articles in enough detail.  If a page was previously rated as 'good' and then rated as 'minimum' I'm not sure what affect that has.  Anyway, what is a death eater?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:26, 20 September 2011 (UTC)
::::It's curious, then, that when I looked at it, it was at Good level. In my experience, if you simply approve the edit, it comes in at the same level it was before, but you do have the option to demote it as you review it, and you can re-review it later, which results in, apparently, the earlier review being lost to history, both as to what it was and who so reviewed it.
::::Harry Potter is a well-written heroic fantasy piece with a good wizard (Harry) pitted against an evil wizard (Voldemort) who is trying to take over the British, and eventually worldwide, Wizard population. Death Eaters are the cadre of wizards that Voldemort has recruited to assist him. Their strategy for world domination apparently involves murdering those who oppose them and any innocents, including non-magic-users (Muggles) who are nearby. While it is, nominally, a children's book, there is certainly enough depth in it to make it worth reading as an adult, and enough to make it worth teaching in at least a few universities, as noted in the RfDs that have been survived. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:09, 20 September 2011 (UTC)
:::::Thanks for that.  I was aware of the use of Harry Potter texts in schools and universities but just curious about something known as the death eater.  Anyway, I hadn't noticed that the default for pages previously rated as 'good' was 'good'.  I'll have to keep my eye out for that in future.  I have rated some things as 'good' but very few (probably only 5% of what I rate) however it may be more than 5% if those that were previously 'good' are rated as 'good' by default when successive edits are made.  Can't understand why HP would ever have been nominated for RfD - even if someone felt it wasn't suitable for schools or universities wouldn't make it a candidate for deletion.
::::::Apparently some people believed that the MG was copyvio; others believed it was not something that would be taught at university, because it was (shudder) popular. People have lost sight of the fact that Charles Dickens, in his day, was a popular writer, as was Shakespeare. And of course, some people felt that because it was a kid's book, it could not possibly have enough depth to make it worth study. At least, that's how I read the arguments in the two real RfD's to date. At least one additional RfD was posted by a vandal, with no supporting information, and was promptly eliminated by an admin.
::::::One of the big things about Voldemort (''fly from death'') is his fear of dying, and so everything he involves himself with has to somehow try to ridicule that fear... like whistling in the dark to prove you're not afraid. The name Voldemort gives his supporters is part of that pattern. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:12, 20 September 2011 (UTC)

OK, I began to write the book on the wrong place, Wikibooks instead of Wikilibros.

Does Jamaica have provinces (and by extension provencial flags)?  That could have been a legitimate edit, but more explanation by the anon would have been better.

:OK, I cleared it up.  In case you're wondering why there was a list of graphics there in the first place, it's a little complicated.  This honor has the same requirements for all countries, but each country has different answers.  I had set up a template a while back, which was intended to be &quot;subst&quot; in when starting an answer page for a new country.  It has all the requirements on it and a little formatting to suggest how the answers might be structured.  The thought that a country might not have states or provinces did not occur to me when I set up the subst template.  Oh well.  I imagine it also did not occur to the people who came up with the requirements in the first place either. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 13:51, 6 November 2011 (UTC)

Hello Xania, just wanted to say thank you for transwiking [[Canadian LGBT History]] for me.

I would like to ask your advice on an idea I've had recently. Would it be advisable to create a Project for wikibooks entitled &quot;Winter Break Backlog Elimination Drive&quot; or something of the sort? It could be in the same vein as [[w:WikiProject_Wikify/Drives/Invite|Wikification Drives]] on wikipedia. Basically, over the break I've been hoping to tackle the backlogs on wikibooks, specifically the transwikis, splitting, and stubs. I recognize that I won't make significant progress alone and therefore I was hoping to enlist others to help. It might foster a sense of community, or it might fail spectacularly.

== Acidity of alcohols and water. ==

Dear Xania
I add this topic to point out to you to have a check on your review of the edit http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Organic_Chemistry/Alcohols&amp;oldid=2199272.
That edit was on the article [[Organic Chemistry/Alcohols]] in section [[Organic_Chemistry/Alcohols#Acidity]] which deleted &lt;tt&gt;Alcohols are weak acids, even weaker than water&lt;/tt&gt; from the article saying ''water is not an acid''. However it should be noted that the term acidity is based on the concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion dissociated in a particular amount of solutions. The term p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is used for comparison.

You can refer to the 'pedia article [[wikipedia:Acidity#Dissociation_and_equilibrium|Acidity]].

The statement is very clear from NCERT chemistry text book for class XII 
[http://ncertbooks.prashanthellina.com/class_12.Chemistry.ChemistryII/Unit 11.pdf]

&lt;tt&gt;Alcohols are, however, weaker acids than water. This can be
illustrated by the reaction of water with an alkoxide.&lt;tt&gt;

Thank You&lt;/br&gt;

== Reviewer ==
I'm putting this here because it is more private and Quintucket does not dissever to get dragged into the high visibility discussion about more generic issues.  
The issue of this particular attribution of the flag is not the main issue, the issue is why you and the user felt that the automation was not sufficient, as for the user he justified it on the aesthetic level, to me that simply is not a good enough reason, any Wikibookian with 8 days presence on the project can make a similar claim. I accepted even if I stated that I did not like and the reasons why, the special treatment you felt that this particular user should be granted, an exception to a normal and not particular hard process.&lt;br&gt;
To me the issue is closed since I will not propose a change to the automatic criteria, not the establishing of a guideline or policy for the attribution of the flag. I do however feel that the points I raised are important and would support anyone that would feel a need to get one of those things more clearly established, as I stated I have a high distaste about special treatments by arbitrary decisions, you have been in the project long enough to understand why and why they are problematic. They undermine future decisions...&lt;br&gt;
I have all faith in Quintucket performance and the call for respecting the automatic process has nothing to do with the Wikibookian.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 20:48, 1 January 2012 (UTC)
: If you look at my rights change log then you'll see that it wasn't special treatment.  Many users have requested it and I have granted it.  You will see that I don't just grant all requests as I expect them to have quite a few constructive edits, not just 2 days of edits (you'll see that the guys whose requests I opposed on the RFA pages haven't really edited since) and that they're not just making silly edits trying to increase their edit count.  I have also promoted some users even if they haven't requested it.  I am waiting to see what others Admins think.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:50, 1 January 2012 (UTC)

::I do not think anyone will get to take any positions on the subject since it is a done deal, and by itself it wouldn't even merit further discussion, unless by some unfortunate reason Quintucket abused the tool in some way. However this attribution of the flag, will establish a precedent for further requests of the tools and jeopardizes the rational in establishing the standing requirements, that is why I'm attempting to explain my point of view to you, when other intentionally or not remain silent. I have not been very actively involved in establishing the automation process itself, did participate in the vote for the activation of the review system (starting from a negative position to a non blocking), I preferred the previous system of reviewing edits and the log the showed pages that had not been paroled.
::I hope that you consider the points I have expressed especially in directing any opposition you may have to the standing requirements to a proper discussion, if you feel like and not to bypass the process in a, if not discriminatory way as a unnecessary fashion since any Wikibookian that continuously participates in the project will get the flag automatically and by accepting minor reasons to bypass the process we incentive the feel of personal discrimination, or an arbitrary judgment of value, even if it is not intended, you can understand that any negative result may have by itself a negative impact on the person making the request.
::One thing that I appreciate in your actions in the project is that you tend to think by yourself (and not necessary in line with the conventions and the supposedly majority view) and at times be able to take more controversial positions. In this case I'm only pointing to you that if a process is established only a good reason, enough to supersede the negative impacts would validate the creation of spot exceptions, that if those exceptions become common then the problem is in the process itself.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:25, 1 January 2012 (UTC)

Review what you understand and if you do have doubts or miss the time do not review, someone else will that has the time to do a proper analysis. I myself at times will not review mathematical formulas or source code not because I do not have the knowledge but I do not have the time to do a proper job at it (even in works I am extremely active), the reverse is also true I do not review material that I'm incapable of judging, there are a very few instances that I do it like you, but on simple edits not on large changes like in that page.

== Wikijunior geography books ==

Hello, I notice that you are a major contributor to the Wikijunior geography books such as Wikijunior:Europe, Wikijunior:Africa, etc. I feel that books of this form could benefit from a unifying page, a page that would serve as a title page for the books and would include links to each of them. It could even have a labelled maps of the continents with links such as I have done on [[Wikijunior:Countries A-Z]]. This page could possibly be titled [[Wikijunior:Geography]], though I realize that these books also include culture and things that are not exclusively geographical, so possibly another name would be in order. What is your opinion on this? - [[User:Liam987|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#808000;border:1px solid;background:#0055A4;text-shadow:0 5px 8px #850000&quot;&gt;'''Liam987'''&lt;/span&gt;]] 13:51, 13 March 2013 (UTC)

== [[Physics course]], [[Physics Course]] and other books ==

About a year ago, and on and off before that, we had a mass copy / paste vandalism in these books as well as a number of others in the electronics field. I put these up for RfD and the RfD was supported along with agreement that the author should be blocked if they continued to engage in the copy / paste activity. Despite numerous attempts to engage them via email and talk pages (they use two fixed IPs and three accounts) all communication was ignored. This resulted in repeated blocks, each longer than before. At the end of each block they would come back and start the copyvios again. All we were asking for was confirmation of the source so we could verify the copyright status - but every time we were ignored. Anyway, the last year long block expired last month and the vandal is back. I removed all the additions they made to [[Physics Course]] which had the same characteristics as before - clearly copy / paste with no attribution, blocked the IP again and protected the book to stop IPs editing. Their next action was to create [[Physics course]] from another IP to get round the block and the protection. It is again full of copy / paste material. I've nuked it, and protected it. Why am I telling you? To explain my actions as I see you have also tried to get the IP editor to engage in a conversation via their talk page &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:31, 28 March 2013 (UTC)

:I'd argue against. A program will, because of the nature of computers, be precise; humans, not so much. A cup of milk should translate to 250ml; a computer program will translate it to 243ml, and I have yet to see a measuring cup in a kitchen that can measure to that precision. Also, some human interaction is really required to adjust everything so that proportions remain valid. At least one recipe book I've seen explicitly states that English units are used because the proportions involved are critical, and precise enough that translation to Metric would wreck the recipes.

::''English units''?  American units maybe but most British people would be more familiar with metric units than imperial ones and would find them less confusing especially given the different values of pints, quarts, etc. on different sides of the Atlantic.  Anyway, I agree with the above that automated conversion wouldn't be a great idea.  No automation would handle the infamous American ''cup'' whose value could mean anything depending on what's inside the cup.  Human conversion or insisting that only metric is used is the way forward.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:13, 1 April 2013 (UTC)
:::I was quoting from the book. But yes, despite the fact that only the US and Liberia have refused to standardize on SI units, the feet / pounds / degrees F system is called &quot;English units&quot;, or worse &quot;Imperial&quot;... which becomes even more confusing when you look into it a bit and see that a US gallon is not the same as a British gallon.

== Could I ask you this ? ==

Thank you for checking my article. 

I'm doing AvsA v2.0 which has a lot differences from v1.0; so I would like to re-update the current Allies vs. Axis as the guide for v2.0 but still want to keep v1.0 guide somewhere for reference. 

a) I create Allies vs. Axis_v1.0 and copy current page (v1.0) to that one and rewrite current page to v2.0

b) I re-update current page to v2.0 and leave the v1.0 inside it, which makes it becomes very long page.

c) I re-update current page to v2.0 and delete v1.0. I don't really want this option.

What should I do ? What option is easy for people to check &amp; people (who need it) to follow ? Please advice. Thank you very much.

Hi Xania, you droped your name on [[m:Wikikids#People interested]] in 2011. I've been updating and expanding the proposal (which runs in French and Dutch), are you still interested in it ? Bye !

==Implementing Easier and More Efficient Metadata Tags on Wikibooks==
Hi Xania,  

I wanted to give you an update on the previously discussed implementation of LRMI metatags on Wikibooks.  There is no longer the need to use the html tag extension as was discussed in the previous proposal, because it is now supported by core mediawiki. In addition, these changes sanction all mediawiki installations by default and increase the assurance of LRMI as a long-term standard.  If you're not familiar with  [http://schema.org/CreativeWork Schema.org], it is a shared collection of standard schemas that was developed by Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Yandex to allow webmasters to markup their pages in ways recognized by major search providers.
[http://wikisource-dev.wmflabs.org/w/index.php/CreativeWork This] page demonstrates these features in the context of wikisource and can demonstrate the optimization within a Google search engine [http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwikisource-dev.wmflabs.org%2Fw%2Findex.php%2FMicrodata here].

To understand this implementation in simpler terms, all that would have to be done is for contributors of Wikibooks (and other educational resources) to use the Schema metatags which are already the most widely used and efficient way for content to be accurately organized by all of the big search engines.  With this said, let me know if you think it would be worthwhile to implement these metatags now that it will be done via Schema.org, or if you have further questions.

==Please help checking http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Allies_vs._Axis==

Thank you very much,

[[Category:Formatting templates|{{PAGENAME}}]]
{{SelfTdoc}}{{TypeTaid}}
;Purpose
This template provides compatible formatting to duplicate the appearance of the monospace tables the N3V staff used when building pages for Kinds, containers and so forth. Using this template to set the style allows a wikitable to neaten up the staffs ragged efforts, and make things more readable.

;usage
*This template is meant to be used in an HTML style tag after the &lt;code&gt;'''&amp;lt;''' '...' ''' &amp;gt;'''&lt;/code&gt; so as to form HTML format commands like:
&lt;code&gt;'''{| style= &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Pseudo-table}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; '''&lt;/code&gt; and forms the pre-quoted string above. The raw code has over-ride parameters B,BG,CO,MW,W,P,M
;Over ride parameters shown below
&lt;pre&gt;
 &quot;padding: {{{P|1em}}}; border: {{{B|1px dashed rgb(47, 111, 171)}}};
 color: {{{CO|black}}};
 background:{{{BG|rgb(249, 249, 249)}}};
 max-width:{{{MW|{{{maxwidth|68%}}}}}};
     width:{{{W|{{{width|68%}}}}}};
 align:{{{AL|left}}}; 
 font-face:{{{F|monospace}}};
 font-size:{{{S|10pt}}}; {{{other|}}};&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
* The default width is shown above, but the template call can be given an alternative width as follows:
::form the call: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{| style={{pseudo-table|width=XX%}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; '''''versus the default''''' &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{| style={{pseudo-table}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
* The format also provides for other format parameters to be included in the style block by defining the parameter ''''other''''.
** for example: '''|other=color:blue; would assert the table contents as a blue font. Other HTML/CSS formatting elements are equally valid.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
;for other examples...
:Use the {{plain link|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php5/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Pseudo-table|What links here}} wiki feature to examin a use inclusion.

;Purpose
:This template is used with {{Tl|TRScc-top}} to set off Wikibook's Content Creation HowTo pages ({{TL|Content Creation|Content Creation TOC}}), especially those on advanced topics where {{tl|FUN-beg}} (or -top) would be inappropriate.

* It will also auto-categorize the page to the [[:category:Trainz Content Creation]].
:* The parameter '|TA=yes' definition will cross-categorize the page as well in the Trainz Asset Management and Creation [[:category:Trainz AM&amp;C]].&lt;br
/&gt;
:* defining either of the parameter '|refs2=''something&lt;/i&gt;' will add the page to [[:Category:Trainz references]].&lt;br

'''''Eryx jaculus''''', known commonly as the '''Javelin sand boa''', is a species of snake in the [[Snakes of Europe/Species/Boidae|Boidae]] family.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITIS&quot;&gt;{{ITIS |id=634806 |taxon=''Eryx'' |accessdate=August 16th, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDiarmid, Roy W., Jonathan A. Campbell, and T'Shaka A. Touré, 1999. ''Snake Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference, vol. 1''&lt;/ref&gt; First described by Linnaeus in 1758, it is the type species of the genus ''[[Snakes of Europe/Species/Eryx|Eryx]]''.

[[File:Eryx jaculus.jpg|thumbnail|Eryx jaculus, the Sand Boa]]

==Geographic range==
''Eryx jaculus'' is found in eastern and south eastern Europe, the Caucasus, the Middle East, and Africa.

==Description==
The javelin sand boa may grow to 80&amp;nbsp;cm (31½ inches) in total length. Coloring varies greatly. Dorsally it may be grayish, tan, brownish, or reddish, with darker blotches or bars in an irregular network. It usually has a dark streak from the eye to the corner of the mouth. Ventrally it is whitish or yellowish. It is heavy-bodied and has a short blunt tail. The ventrals are very narrow, less than ⅓ of the width of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, E.N. and J.A. Burton. 1978. ''A Field Guide to the Reptiles and Amphibians of Britain and Europe''. Collins. London. ISBN 0-00-219318-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The rostral is large and broad with an angular horizontal edge. The eye is separated from the labials by one or two rows of small scales. There are 10-14 upper labials. The dorsal scales are in 40-50 rows, smooth anteriorly, but weakly keeled posteriorly. There are 165-200 ventrals, and 15-34 subcaudals.&lt;ref&gt;Boulenger, G.A. 1893. ''Catalogue of the Snakes in the British Museum (Natural History), Volume I''. London.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I thought it would be best to open this discussion page since there's more than one group working on the project! This way we can all work together! [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 13:16, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Sounds good. So I was just talking to my group and for some reason we didn't quite realise that there will be LOADS of groups working on the same topic and people have actually started writing stuff. We thought it would only be fair if we did this in a '''structured''' way, so dividing the whole topic &quot;online identity&quot; between all of us so no one ends up being left out. Ok? As other people have already started working on the intro, theories and important characters we thought about picking the whole social media aspect in relation to online identity (because that seems like something that hasn't been addressed directly yet)- mainly focusing on the development of online identities (user names, avatars and actual profiles, anonymity etc) and associated privacy issues, security settings and so on. Would that be ok with you guys?! Just making sure that we're all happy here and get a fair share of contribution. Please give feedback as soon as possible as we want to start writing! (-Team TenaciousD) --[[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 13:27, 23 March 2014 (UTC)


Agreed, and to get the ball rolling, I'm thinking of looking at the security side of things. Which means I'll be looking at information online, how secure/insecure our online profiles and interactions are, how this has changed over time etc. Any problems or questions just contact me! [[User:Stirmartin12|Stirmartin12]] ([[User talk:Stirmartin12|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stirmartin12|contribs]]) 13:56, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Yeah well as I was speaking for the whole group that section should be saved for you, Martin. Just need the overall permission of other groups. Or we could just be very authoritarian here and say that section is ours, end of discussion. ;) --[[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 14:08, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Okay, I was thinking of making a start on the issues surrounding impression management. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 10:39, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

This all sounds good to me, I think I shall have a look at profile pictures and the connections they have in connection with persona and impression management. Do people think its a topic worth talking about on its own, or perhaps a subtitle to impression management? [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 11:15, 24 March 2014 (UTC) 

I would maybe say within impression management. However, once it is on the page and would look better as a separate section we could always edit it? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 11:24, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

That all sounds fine by me! I was thinking about doing a bit about how the development of social media sites has effected on how online identities are created. [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 14:18, 24 March 2014 (UTC) 

Thats true, we can always change it towards the end if we think it will look better another way. I think persona was also an interesting topic covered in the lecture which could be relevant in the wikibook, for example the idea of wearing a mask as being similar to our online identities. I believe it was C.G. Jung that spoke about this, so maybe he is a theorist we'd like to consider as well. [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 16:06, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

Sounds good. I'm currently looking into personalised adverts, so how online advertisement is changing due to companies gathering and using personal user information from e.g. social networks like facebook. [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 20:07, 24 March 2014 (UTC)


Just to let people know, I'm working on a section on blending online and offline identities. It would be handy for everyone working on the Online Identity chapter to put a wee note in this discussion so that every person knows which areas are being covered. [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 18:04, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

RedGebsKasia, I am late too this as I have been so busy and have just realised that you are doing profile pictures. I may have added a small amount of text to that section without checking here first, sorry! There are so groups making it difficult to choose a certain theme. I am going to try and gather information on the risks of online identity, discussing bullying, paedophilia etc as oppose to genuine security and fraud issues. Does anyone have any objections? [[User:Debsi91|Debsi91]] ([[User talk:Debsi91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Debsi91|contribs]]) 16:13, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
 
No worries at all! We can all add to any sections if we have something to add anyway! That sounds like a good idea to me! [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 17:16, 27 March 2014 (UTC)


Hey there, I just wanted to check what everyone's attitude is towards editing or adding to what other groups have written about? My group are still in the process of doing research, so we haven't got round to posting our stuff up. When we do, there will probably be some overlap with what the rest of you have written. Would you like us to ask here before we add stuff to or edit other people's sections, should we just crack on with it or should we try to just create our own little subheadings? Just thought I better check in case we inadvertently start causing chaos! [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 20:49, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE SilentJamie''' Regarding editing, I think it's inevitable that we'll step on each other's toes a little with there being so many individuals working on the topic. I'm totally comfortable with people editting anything I write and, so far, the team members I have conferred with are also comfortable with it. (Perhaps it is worth leaving a note that one has edited on the discussion page.) [[User:Kriscampbell91|Kriscampbell91]] ([[User talk:Kriscampbell91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kriscampbell91|contribs]]) 11:34, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Kriscampbell91''' That's grand! I can't see anyone having to do any major edits because the work that's been done so far looks great, but I might add a few paragraphs to some of the sections at some point. Still, I'll make sure my group is aware that we should leave a little note here if we're going to do any editing. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • 
[[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 12:26, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys, im a bit late to the game here, my laptops been in the shop all week, i was supposed to get it back tuesday but no such luck. The section I decided to work on was interlinking your web use with your social media. However, i'm starting to think this subject could be quite limited so if anyone has any suggestions as to directions i could that would be a big help. Im already looking at how it hinders your anonymity online so whoever is doing anonymity has covered anything concerning this help would be welcome
[[User:EuanWhitelaw|EuanWhitelaw]] ([[User talk:EuanWhitelaw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/EuanWhitelaw|contribs]]) 15:46, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE: SilentJamie and editing''' you may want to think about looking to see who’s work you are editing before you edit it and then leave them a note on their discussion page telling then why you thought best to edit it, ie. Spelling mistakes, wrong or misleading information, that sort of stuff. [[User:SmithBiancaAnn|SmithBiancaAnn]] ([[User talk:SmithBiancaAnn|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SmithBiancaAnn|contribs]]) 22:41, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE: EuanWhitelaw''' I don’t think you should worry about the section being limited as online identity follow many different routes and then branch off even feather from then on. Your best bet if you are worried about the overlap in information is too try and source things that no one else would have looked at, i.e., perhaps look at some key reading for simple concepts but to follow up names of references in those book to gain knowledge and research that no one else has yet to look into. But if you’re wanting to look into anonymous/anonymity then perhaps you could look into online gaming alongside RedGebsKasia as online gaming is a platform for shielding ones true identity, especially if you look at reality games such as Second Life or IMVU, which I am sure you will have seen advertised at some point online. For these avatar creating is necessary, potentially re-designing yourself and concealing ones identity. [[User:SmithBiancaAnn|SmithBiancaAnn]] ([[User talk:SmithBiancaAnn|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SmithBiancaAnn|contribs]]) 22:41, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE: EuanWhitelaw ''' If you are struggling on deciding what to wright on online identity, here are some of the most interested topics to wright about on online identity, the development of identity, security, impression management, gaming and the blending of online to offline identities.

I will be discussing online identity using theorists that are well established in the psychology sector as they offer many incites to how online and offline interactions have impact one ones identity and identity of self. I will also hopefully also be talking about this in relation to the ‘project of self’ which is a theoretical theory of how a person gradually builds up their identity, this can also relate to J Lacan’s Mirror Theory which I am sure many of you may wish to refer to or wright about. [[User:SmithBiancaAnn|SmithBiancaAnn]] ([[User talk:SmithBiancaAnn|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SmithBiancaAnn|contribs]]) 22:45, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE: BerlinLea and Advertising''' you may wish to look into how Huru, which is an online TV streaming sight that allows to you watch TV episodes at any time, allows you to choose which ad’s are relevant to you. [[User:SmithBiancaAnn|SmithBiancaAnn]] ([[User talk:SmithBiancaAnn|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SmithBiancaAnn|contribs]]) 22:49, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE: SmithBiancaAnn''' Thanks for the suggestion! I will definitely give it a look and see if I can include this as some kind of case study. However, I think we should all try to narrow down our focus as much as possible as there are so many people involved in this project and it would be a shame if there was a lot of energy wasted on something that someone else is already covering... Of course once we've got our texts posted we should read over each others' stuff and add more information/ material etc wherever it's needed. Concerning your suggestions for Euan- these are really the most popular fields relating to online identity and are already being covered by people in our group (and probably others as well). So I think if you're still happy to focus on interlinks between websites and social media, Euan, you should give it a try and see how much you can find on it. If not there is loads of other stuff that can be considered. Remember- it's not about quantity but quality! :) [[User:BerlinLea|BerlinLea]] ([[User talk:BerlinLea|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BerlinLea|contribs]]) 08:58, 29 March 2014 (UTC)


I would like to briefly touch upon Lanier's views of social network sites compared to homepages of the 1990's and how he feels that SNSs are not allowing people to express their identites and creativity. I am unsure where this would fit however; does anyone have any suggestions? In the Main theorists section? Or in the social media sites section? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 16:20, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

RE: ButtonsElizabeth I think that maybe it would go better in the social media section if you are just briefly touching on something? I think if it were in the main theorist section that would require a greater body of working other than this topic of SNS. Otherwise, I think his work is a really good point to bring up! [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 15:08, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks for your feedback Kasia. I put it in Theorists last night but now I am not sure. What do you think? Do you think that it fits in that section or should I move it? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 16:18, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

'''catfish'''
Hi guys, I've been having a look online for some different material to add to the page and I've been doing a lot of reading about Catfish and I was wondering what people thought about adding an entire sub-heading for it or if it would seem better for me to just add the text below anonymity. I also noticed that &quot;catfish&quot; was in the glossary but I couldn't see any text on the page about it, so I wasn't sure how relevant it would seem unless we used the word in context? Let me know what you think! [[User:Megan4pmGlasses|Megan4pmGlasses]] ([[User talk:Megan4pmGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Megan4pmGlasses|contribs]]) 11:10, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Catfish''' I actually had Catfish in mind as I was reading around disembodiment and multiplicity! I think it would be a great modern and current representation of the theories we are exploring! You could explore the term Catfish and perhaps go on to explore the ways in which play with their identity exemplified in the documentary and in the TV show! I am looking at extending the multiplicity section a little, so adding to this idea is perfect timing! [[User:Kriscampbell91|Kriscampbell91]] ([[User talk:Kriscampbell91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kriscampbell91|contribs]]) 12:33, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys! I wasn't sure where to write this on the page but I just wanted to let people know that in reference to groups using this page for their own discussions (Team Axe and Team Straight Outta Compston (excellent!)), you may want to create a group page and hold your discussion re. presentations etc. on there so that you don't have to be scrolling through all of this every time you want to make a suggestion to your group. We (group Tenacious D) have been doing this and it's been working really well.

Hey guys, I've posted my piece on youtube on my discussion page, if anyone wants to proof read that form me it would be much apreciated, im also struggling to wrap my ehad around the referencing system, and trying to find a place on the page to put my bit. should i just put it at the bottom or should i put it near the socail networking section as thtas the category it falls under. Help would be apreciated ASAP! [[User:EuanWhitelaw|EuanWhitelaw]] ([[User talk:EuanWhitelaw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/EuanWhitelaw|contribs]]) 13:07, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

==Gaming==

I was thinking of some more ideas for the main body of our wiki, and was wondering about the gaming culture as being a kind on online identity? I'm not greatly familiar with gaming, so I was wondering on people's thoughts of gaming acting as an online identity in the virtual world, for example The Sims. Or could any game be considered an online identity? [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 18:09, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

RE: Gaming for RedGebsKasia, not all games are online so I wouldn't say all of them are online identities. From my own experience the best thing to look at if you're looking for online identity is MMORPGs - for example World of Warcraft or EVE Online - they're places where people truly establish secondary identities. Of course Second Life is about as extreme an example as you can get of online vs offline identity if you want to go that route. Hopefully that helps :). [[User:Stirmartin12|Stirmartin12]] ([[User talk:Stirmartin12|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stirmartin12|contribs]]) 18:17, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

RE: RedGebsKasia, In terms of referring to the online gaming identities, I would say that it is a brilliant thing to talk about as it is no secret that people often gender swap on these online games such as WOW aka world of warcraft, and this obviously reflects some of the major ideas talked about by online identity theorists, this idea that the choice of identity swapping is so easy and the idea that we can dibble and dabble in it if we so wish. Of course this in terms of gaming can in turn spill over into our real life. Here it would be perfect to talk about Second Life as there has been many reports of instances in which individual, who spend all of their time in this virtual reality, lose track of what is and is not considered to be appropriate in actual physical society. However, I would suggest that you steer clear of defining Second Life as an online game as it is more of a virtual reality. One of the cases I can think of the top of my head is how a middle aged male went into a supermarket dressed in nothing other than an extremely large nappy, this occurred as he blurred the boundaries between virtual and actual reality. In Second Life it was his fetish to be a baby and so his avatar of course was a baby, and too much time spent on this virtual site had lead him to forget perhaps that in fact he actually was not a baby. I am aware that there are plenty of other similar cases out their regarding the blurring of boundaries from online to off. You may also wish to talk about how people become to blur the boundaries in the first place, for example it was obvious that this person has some incessant need or longing to be seen as a baby and essential Second Life only offered him a way to be this, arguably he may have always wanted to be seen as a baby. Therefor it could also be argues that online just offers us an extension of our selves. So you may wish to also look at it that way.

RE: Gaming: these all seem like great ideas! Looking into gaming seems like a good idea, perhaps there is someway we can divide this topic up since there seems to be others who know more about minecraft, whereas I'm less aware of what it is as i've never played it? I'll look into the idea of having a secondary life, and also the blurring of reality and online identities, as it seems like a really interesting point of discussion!

RE: Gamaing: this seems like a pretty solid section and think it links well together with belonging section as many people who use these games are escaping the real world to enter an online community where they can meet like minded people and achieve that feeling of belonging. If that's something you are interested in looking at. I also just noticed that one of Van Koten's main research questions is; What are the main forces at work in the production &amp; consumption of digital representation? and get had suggested this means; what makes digital media so popular? So you could look at it from the perspective of the online identity you adpot in these games, this is what draws people in.

I also found an interesting thesis paper that explores various topics within online identity but has a particularly interesting section on gaming and player involvement that may be useful to you it's called; Selling Your Self: Online Identity in the Age of a Commodified Internet, by Marwick, A.E.(2005)You can find the whole thing online.

It may be good to look at the huge rise in Player vs Player gaming, and how their online identity of playing the game transcends that of offline identities such as gender, race, political viewpoint and so on. It, ''potentially'', can often reduce or challenge the pre-existing ideas or stereotypes they have of that identity.

==Anonymity==

At the end of the impression management section I think we need to address whether or not it is deception and a negative thing. Do you think that would then lead on well to the issue of anonymity? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 17:06, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

'''RE: Anonymity for ButtonsElizabeth.''' -- I understand you've taken on Impression Management and have its material covered. I also see you have posted a question about linking it onto anonymity. I'm not sure it's a seamless link insofar that impression management seems to entail [for the most part] a balance of sharing, withholding, and distorting information instead of being totally negative. Written the right way it could flow into anonymity really well though! I have also already starting drafting some ideas for anonymity (particularly the dishinibition effect and trolling online) so perhaps we could converse and work to have our sections flow into one another. You can message me on my discussion page? [[User:Kriscampbell91|Kriscampbell91]] ([[User talk:Kriscampbell91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kriscampbell91|contribs]]) 12:30, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

I am also going to point out '''the disembodiment effect''' - how the idea of agency outwith the physical realm of our bodies is what differentiates online activity and online behaviour from our own behaviour in real life. This, I will '''lead into anonymity and the disinhibition effect.''' The idea of losing oneself in one's online behaviour without one's body to be held accountable. I will '''also touch on multiplicity''' - the idea of taking on various online identities within the disembodied state! I am disembodied writing this, right now!

Do you mind if I add a bit to this section? I was going to bring up the fact that our online identities can be used for deception, but conclude with the fact that it is actually only a minority that use it as a negative outlet; many use anonymity in a constructive and progressive way. If you have already started to cover this no worries.

Hi, guys! I was thinking today that we haven't really talked about anonymous bulling that happens online. For example when people create fake online identities to harass people they know in real life and sometimes that can have really terrible consequences like suicides. And also that sometimes people create online identities just for 'trolling'. I think that's something to write about, but I'm not sure. What do you guys think? [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 14:54, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yes I agree Liisa! That's definitely something we should consider. I'd actually be able to provide some case studies I think as I had to do loads of research on cyberbullying for a psychology internship.

[[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 16:36, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

That sounds like a really good idea, Caroline. The anonymity changes the way they present themselves, so their identity is different online then it would be in reality. [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 16:43, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I hope that it is okay that I added a statistic/quote about Koreans and how anonymity has affected their sense of blurred identities into the Dissociative Imagination section.

Does anyone know what to do when we only have one reference for a large section of text that is split into several paragraphs? Should we just put in one reference at the end of the section or should we repeat the reference after each little paragraph? I'm not using any direct quotes so it seems a bit pointless to keep repeating the one reference.

'''Jamie''' Do not quote me on this, but I would guess that in your situation one reference at the end would be okay, as long as your are referencing.

[[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 21:59, 2 April 2014 (UTC)


'''Jamie''' I agree, it's better to ask, but as long as you have only one reference for one long section, I don't think it is necessary to reference it after every short paragraph. It should be enough to reference it once in the end of the section. --[[User:Rekarippel|Rekarippel]] ([[User talk:Rekarippel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rekarippel|contribs]]) 23:36, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks guys! I'll ask on the Reading Room just to be sure, but I'm sure that the one reference at the end of the section should be fine. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 08:53, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Using the same reference for more than one paragraph''' - As I mentioned earlier, I asked on the Reading Room about whether we can just use one in-text citation in a section where there are separate paragraphs but only reference has been used. The answer came back that this is not the proper way to do it. Instead, separate citations should be used at the end of each paragraph to prevent confusion should a paragraph be moved during the editing process. Just thought I should let you all know as, like me, some of you thought that one citation would be enough.

Hi Guys, I've just added some references to the list and they seem to have come out ok. However, I am a bit concerned because I added them amongst the others already there and did it alphabetically. However, it looks to me as if the reference section is a bit messy and confused. Some people seem to be doing it alphabetically, and others are just adding their reference to the bottom of the pile. Do we have a plan of which way it is meant to be? [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 20:20, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

== Introduction ==

Thought I would start a new separate conversation for the introduction. I had made a start to it and was just briefly outlining some of the stuff I thought needed to and could be covered in later sub headings in the main concepts area. Obviously everything we could possibly cover is not there so here we can discuss what else needs to go in it and what needs to be removed and modified. And we can add parts to the intro as the main concepts section develops. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 10:33, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

== Narrative ==

I am working on a bit about narrative and think it would fit quite well just after the main theorists section, as it makes reference to a lot of the topics that others are going to discuss later. I am going to put it in, and if it doesn't work and when aspects need changed we can discuss it here. Let me know what you think. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 11:58, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Sounds like a good idea! The one thing I was wondering is whether it might be better to categorise your paragraph on narrative under the heading &quot;Forms of Digital Representation&quot;? That way, if someone is writing a paragraph on realism they could put it there as well since the two concepts are kind of related. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 16:58, 28 March 2014 (UTC) 

I am more than happy to do that, good suggestion. I am going to put it up later tonight and please give me some feedback upon what you feel should be changed and added; I feel like I am struggling to expand it a bit. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 10:36, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

I've just taken a look at what you've written and it looks good to me. Admittedly, I've not read much into the whole concept of Narrative so I'm probably not in the best position to help you expand on what you've written. Having said that, the one thing I can think of adding off the top of my head would be something about the psychological component of narratives. Quite a few slides from the lecture on Online Identity were given over to the discussion of this, so it would probably be a good idea to explore it in relation to Facebook posts and profile pictures which I noticed you only briefly mention. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 20:37, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi, can I add something into the narrative section? I was thinking about writing how different Facebook pages deal with narratives? Some people put on everything, but others are a lot more critical about what they post? In a sense it is an edited narrative? Also, I was thinking of writing something on how people can have false narratives on chat rooms or dating sites because they feel their lies are safe and they feel liberated being somebody new? [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 16:33, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I think that is a good idea Caroline, especially as I was feeling that the section was looking a bit thin but have been struggling to pad it out. I like that you are approaching the negative side of the argument too. You could maybe even link it to the concept of realism, can we can put a definition of realism in the glossary. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 19:19, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I've added two sections to narrative and I can add a definition of realism to the glossary [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 20:39, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I recognise some material in this section from my lectures.

== Blended Identities ==

Just thought I'd start this separate little conversation in case anyone else from another group was planning on writing a section about blended identities. It should be a relatively short section since as far as I can tell, there's not that much research on the subject, but if anyone wants to contribute feel free to let me know here! [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 16:58, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey there Jamie, I'm working on blended identities too. I've done a little research and constructed a paragraph, would you like to show me some of your work so that we can both make this a good, coherent section? Here's mine thus far:
&quot;When those who have only previously communicated online meet in a real world situation, this is referred to as 'blending identity', wherein the online and offline identities of a person merge. For example, in the case of online dating, the users first interact through the website's chat interface having approved of the other person's profile (their online identity). They then may decide to interact outside of the Internet in a different social context, which is when they meet each other's offline identities. Fandom is another instance in which the two identities merge, as a user will construct an online identity for pursuing an idol/celebrity then proceed to reveal their offline identity when they meet.&quot;
So far, very basic. I'd like to perhaps include a proper definition of 'offline identity' and better link this to the lecture/seminar material. Any thoughts? [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 19:38, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey Imara, I'm still in the process of doing research but I'll get it all written up and post it here as soon as possible so as you can have a look through it. A lot of what I've found relates to blended identity in online fan communities, so that should fit nicely on to the end of your paragraph. What you've written looks great so far! Are you planning on putting your definition of &quot;offline identity&quot; in the main article on blended identities or is that something that you think would be better getting added to the glossary section? Also, when you mention linking what you've written to the lecture/seminar material; are you talking about your definition of offline identity or your main paragraph on blended identities? [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 16:34, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey Jamie, I am wanting to write something about how people blend various online identities and in return, their natural identity becomes unclear and confused because they are displaying multiple personalities.

I really like this section; I think it is really well researched.

In the fan culture section do you think it would be possible to split it into smaller subheadings? I got advised to do that for the social network sites section as that was considerably longer than any other section, and it did make the whole thing look a bit better and fit in a bit more. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 22:08, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah, that's fine. I agree that it needs to be split up into smaller subheadings. I'm just unsure as to what headings I'll use at the moment. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 08:57, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

== Social Media Security ==

Hi everyone, I'm doing the security side of social media but during my research this topic very frequently ends up being tied to user privacy and online privacy. Is anyone else doing that side of things? If not, is it okay if I incorporate that into my side of things? :) [[User:Stirmartin12|Stirmartin12]] ([[User talk:Stirmartin12|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stirmartin12|contribs]]) 18:57, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

I was going to do a small section on online safety which I guess is linked to the security side of things that you're wanting to cover. Do you think we should create a sub-section on Security, Privacy and Safety Issues where we can both post our work? Also, to answer your original question; if I do cover issues of privacy, I'll be doing it in a way that relates to online safety rather than security. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 00:00, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Jamie, I think we could definitely do a subsection on that yes, I will be concentrating on the social media side of things but we can either create a collaborative topic or write seperate parts of the online security thing under subsub headings, if you follow? Any thoughts or preferences? I'll keep hammering away at my bit for now and we can change things up as we go :) [[User:Stirmartin12|Stirmartin12]] ([[User talk:Stirmartin12|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stirmartin12|contribs]]) 14:25, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I've added a section on Grindr to this because I found a few interesting articles about identity use on it, but please feel free to add other info to this section.

I'm only touching on the social media aspect, looking at it more of the perspective of how it encourages a sense of belonging and enables obsessive fan culuture. On the topic of social media secuirity I noticed in the class blog it was a quite common view that secuity varies from site to site maybe you could looking closer at the reasons for this if you're going anywhere near that angle.[[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 15:58, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

That's a good idea actually Claire, I'll do some research around that topic and see what I can add to my drafts so far. Thanks for the suggestion. [[User:Stirmartin12|Stirmartin12]] ([[User talk:Stirmartin12|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stirmartin12|contribs]]) 13:39, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Just thought I'd leave a quick message to say that I've decided to scrap my idea of doing a section on online safety due to time constraints. I don't think writing about it will necessarily add anything to the Wikibook which hasn't been touched upon by other people writing in other sections. Having said that, if anyone feels like taking over and writing about it then go ahead! [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 18:48, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

No worries Jamie. I'll at least be trying to touch upon online security in some way as it's directly related to my topic so it'll be in there in some form, and if this books gets edited by other wikipedians I'm sure they'll expand on it too.

&lt;b&gt;Clairepporter&lt;/b&gt; I agree that we should maybe focus on individual social media networks and refer to their privacy policies to see how each one differs. I've done this for dating apps such as Tinder, but I feel that this would be really interesting to do both facebook and twitter.

==Belonging==

I'm definitely interested in looking into the fan culture side of belonging. Perhaps looking at some of the more serious cases and seeing if there has been any particular academic studies on this area.[[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 15:50, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Fan culture does seem like a very relevant and influencial aspect of online belonging.
I am wanting to look at the concept of online social identities as being part of a performance art, along with a need to proove yourself to others through what you post online. [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 16:01, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

This sounds good so far. I have been looking into how blogging is one of the ways in which users can achieve a sense of belonging. I am going to post it shortly so let me know what you think. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 16:11, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Also, is there any objection if I do a couple of introduction sentences just to link the belonging section into online identity? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 16:11, 31 March 2014 (

RE: Blogging: Not quite sure who wrote this section but I think it has a lot of good ideas. The only part a would suggest a small edit is the section that says 'it is a difficult thing to get your thoughts and opinions published' I thought it was quite informal maybe something along the lines of 'It is difficult for a notice writter to get their thoughts and opinions published'. Its not major change but just an idea. 

I hoping to add to my fan culture section today when I find some more readings, anyone have any thoughts on it so far? [[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 11:33, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

ButtonsElizabeth, do you mind if I add something to the section you have just put up on, &quot;blogging?&quot; [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 16:41, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

You are more than welcome Caroline. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 16:43, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

For the Welcome/Unwelcome section maybe (sorry, not sure which member of our group wrote this particular section) you could round it up a little bit more in relation to online identity, maybe about how welcome or unwelcome aspects affects our online identities? It just jarred a little bit when I was reading it.[[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 19:10, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Caroline, I really like your piece, but I would maybe suggest putting a description of persona in the glossary, especially as I suspect the word is going to come up quite a bit throughout the book. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 19:10, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Elizabeth, I can do that... or at least try. Also my reference in my last edit did not come out right. Can somebody advise what I did wrong? [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 20:45, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I have come across something in my readings which might be useful. I was thinking that online identity and by extension, 'belonging' could be viewed from the perspective of social networks interacting with the media. This would ultimately discuss citizen journalism and communication as people are now getting more involved with news and becoming a part of the process…Does this sounds like something that I could tie into our sub-category? [[User:Debsi91|Debsi91]] ([[User talk:Debsi91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Debsi91|contribs]]) 22:27, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hi Debbie, yeah I think that would work especially after what Greg said this morning in the lecture about citizen journalism he seemed keen for us to tie other topics into our sections. Also social networks are probably the biggest example of the belonging idea anyway. [[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 11:40, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi guys, whats gone up so far looks really good! I was wondering what kind of words we could consider putting in the glossary? I think Persona would be one of these, as Elizabeth says. I think its difficult for us to establish what words online audiences might find contentious considering there may be a variable amount of knowledge on the topic. I'm going to ask with other wikipedians what the situation on this may be, and as to whether there are particular rules/ conventions to follow when looking at the glossary. What does everyone think? [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 14:45, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah I think persona, I added in disinhabition because until this module I didn't know what that meant. I read through the belonging section but they're aren't any other words in particular I noticed but I'll have a double check. Let me know if you get any feedback from other wikipedians Kasia. [[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 15:48, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Great, that's perfect! I will also note any glossary worthy words. I take it we are keeping all of our sections from 100-200 words. I'm not sure if other groups are keeping to a word count or if it depends on the depth of information available on each topic.

I added, &quot;persona to the glossary,&quot; so I don't know why it is not comming up for you to see, but I will take a look. [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 16:29, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

== Main Theorists ==
Hi guys, i'm trying to add to the main theorists section of the wikibook with a few articles by theorists i have found. Yet I realise you will all be looking at the same stuff as this for your own research so i thought it would be a good idea that everyone could simply add to the theorists section as they go along? just post a link to whatever article you're using with the name of the theorist and a short description of their argument. Obviously if you feel like you are just repeating yourself thats ok, and if any of you would like just post a link to any writing under this topic and i can try and write a short summary for the section myself i'd be more than happy to, just an idea. If anyone has a better plan or thinks this wouldn't work so well please feel free to say so.

well I guess we don't have to define it as &quot;Main Theorists&quot; that was just what I choose to begin with, we cold define it as something else in order to try and incorporate as many theorists as we'd like to use i guess. Would that be alright? just leave it as &quot;Online Identity Theorists&quot; or something.
[[User:Shayman1|Shayman1]] ([[User talk:Shayman1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shayman1|contribs]]) 18:42, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I am up for changing it to online identity theorists, as I have some nice information on Lanier but did not know where to put it. Have you done some work on Lanier yourself and I can add to it if need be, or shall I go ahead and you can add to it? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 18:56, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

You could just change the title to &quot;Theorists&quot;? That way people can write about theorists that aren't necessarily defined as &quot;online identity theorists&quot; who have something important to say about online identity. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 19:43, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

That sounds right, I agree with Jamie on this one. I was just about to look into Lanier but i'd say simply add whatever you've got Elizabeth and if i ever find anything else to add i'll do so. It would be good if we could somehow link the theorists section to the section of the book they are referenced in somehow, is it possible to place a link to something further down the page?
[[User:Shayman1|Shayman1]] ([[User talk:Shayman1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shayman1|contribs]]) 19:50, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

There is a section written about McLuhan and Williams under 'Cultural Theories applied to Online Identity' but maybe adding some more information about them to the 'Theorist' section is also a good idea, as it will make it look more organised and easier to find. --[[User:Rekarippel|Rekarippel]] ([[User talk:Rekarippel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rekarippel|contribs]]) 15:30, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi, I'm going to add a bit on this about how the development of SNS has caused people to need more authentic online identities.

[[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 18:08, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I was maybe going to write a little bit about how people tend to present themselves differently to different groups of people in their life and then this is reflected in the use of multiple social media accounts on different sites. (Like how someones facebook may seem professional, then instagram and snapchat could represent a whole other identity) Don't know if that treads on what you're trying to say though? or It could just be an extension to what you're saying, if you maybe angle it that because alot of social media is linked these days it causes individuals to stick to the one online profile? just a few ideas, feel free to write what you want. 
[[User:Shayman1|Shayman1]] ([[User talk:Shayman1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shayman1|contribs]]) 18:55, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

For the profile pictures section, I don't want to write anything  incase it is being worked on, I think we need to develop the persona side of the argument, maybe describing what it is and bringing in briefly Jung's psychological dimensions and how he used the notion of persona to explain phenomena of role-playing.

'''RE Shayman1''' You're welcome to write about that, and maybe to add to that could be how business companies have profiles on social media and certain people who manage them. So, they're basically creating an online identity for their business e.g. all of the things a gym would post on their Facebook would be about fitness or healthy eating. Actually, I think I might want to write about that, if that's cool? We could collaborate the two together?

'''RE Shayman1''' When talking about the online identities of a business, I think it would be important to note their use of social media as a means of seeming less like a business, and make them appear more 'human like', which is against the grain for most businesses who wish to keep a professional standard - for instance, O2 and Tesco Mobile bantering between each other on Twitter.

It would be great to see some statistics of some sort of how social media marketing has grown over the years, and possibly mention how other media outlets that used to make their money from advertising are at a huge loss because of it (newspapers etc.).

'''RE ButtonsElizabeth''' I think it reads really well. I especially enjoyed your quotation from academic reading 'Physically attractive people will get noticed at a party, but articulate, insightful and witty people who know how to spell will get noticed online.' I remember noting it when reading and thinking what an interesting aspect, building identity through manipulation of witty language. Do you know you to set an in-page link from the word 'multiplicity' that can link to the multiplicity section and I could edit 'flexibility' into my text to link to your section. It would link these ideas as they are stemming from the same root of multiple images of identity online. It would really strengthen the page as a collaborative work! I'm not sure how to go about finding out how to do it, I have tried to speak to reading room before regarding how to put notes in the page but heard nothing back - luckily a classmate came to my rescue - so I am reluctant to ask reading room again.

'''Kris''' I don't know how to do it either, sorry. But I have asked on the reading room, so I will check in the morning for that hopeful answer.

==Glossary== 

I was having a quick scan through the Wikibook earlier and I noticed that although we have an awful lot of stuff written up, we only have three terms in the glossary. I thought it might be a good idea to create this little section so that if anyone comes across any terms that they think should be clarified in the glossary, they can put a little note here so that someone can sort it out. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 21:19, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Yeah this is a good idea, I had added a word to it yesterday and noticed the same thing. Not sure who wrote the section of technological determinism under the cultural theories heading but maybe you could add 'technological determinism' to the glossary, as I know before this module I wouldn't have know what it was. [[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 11:51, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah, I agree with you about that. I think that section was done by someone in my group so I'll ask them to add &quot;technological determinism&quot; and &quot;cultural determinism&quot; to the glossary. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 13:31, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi guys, I've consulted other Wikipedians asking on some general advice on the content we should consider putting in our glossary, so they should hopefully get back to me soon. [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 15:03, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I know this isn't directly linked to the glossary but I noticed some people are linking certain words to wikipedia pages, it's a pretty good idea. Can anyone advise me on how to do this? [[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 16:02, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Clairepporter''' What words in particular are you wanting to link to other wikipedia pages? [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 18:54, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Hi Clairepporter''' to link a word to a Wikipedia page, put this type of bracket [ before the Wikipedia web page address, then leave a space and type the word you want to link to then finish off with a ] bracket. So if you wanted to link, say Sherry Turkle, you would begin with a [ then put in the web address here followed by &quot;Sherry Turkle&quot; (without the inverted commas) and finish with a ]. Here is the example [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherry_Turkle Sherry Turkle].

Hi there, I have heard back about information from the Reading Room about Glossary help. They were very helpful, saying that as a writer they considered that very little words were needed to be used in the glossary, however as a reader they would link words that were particularly difficult and perhaps link them to other wiki's or dictionaries to give a description on the word [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 09:51, 3 April 2014 (UTC)


Hi, I've added a glossary entry on, &quot;realism,&quot; but when I looked the word up in the dictionary and on wikipedia I found that it has loads of different meanings in relation to different fields such as: philosophy, sciene, social sciene, media, art and so on. I added the definition that seemed most the central and holistic, but feel free to add to it if you feel it does not involve the notion of online identity and realism. [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 09:57, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

==Layout==
Hi all, since there is so many of us working on the project, a few of us where discussing today that it is quite difficult to organise our Wikibook to make it look aesthetically appealing. I was wondering what people thought about the general layout of the page, and whether things needed to be swapped around to make it look better? For example, I was considering the 'Contents' tab being at the top of screen, whereas the title 'Online Identity' is below this, and not very visible on first glance of the Wiki. What do people thing about putting this below the introduction? [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 15:01, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I was wondering about the layout also. I agree that the content tab should be below the title, so that it would be more clear what we're writing about. I was also thinking about pictures, since that's common especially on Wikipedia and I've seen them on Wikibooks, too. It could make the page flow a bit better and it wouldn't be all text, which looks quite boring to be honest. Should we post pictures if it relates to the subsection that we're writing about or will it be too crowded then, what do you guys think? [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 15:28, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I think that sounds like a good idea. I think it will definitely make the Wiki look a lot more appealing. As you say, I think there being a lot of writing can possibly make it long to read, especially since there is so many topics! However I think we will have to be careful when posting pictures due to copyright. Also we probably won't need pictures for every section. What are peoples thoughts on this? And also which topics would be suitable for pictures and others not so? [[User:RedGebsKasia|RedGebsKasia]] ([[User talk:RedGebsKasia|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedGebsKasia|contribs]]) 15:37, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I think that all sounds good. I was going to ask what people thought about the balanace of the page as we were talking about it with Greg in class today in terms of how well balanced text will make it more asthetically pleasing. Most of the sections are pretty equal apart from the section on social media sites under the impression management heading. Maybe the person who wrote this could consider putting in a sub-sub heading in this just to break it up a little as it is quite a large piece of text. What do people think? [[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 15:55, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm wondering what everyone else thinks about the &quot;Main Concepts&quot; section? It seems a bit odd to me to call a section &quot;Main concepts&quot; and then talk about theorists rather than purely concepts. Also, it makes it seem like all the other sections of the Wikibook aren't main concepts, which isn't necessarily the case. Do you think it would be best to change the name of the section to &quot;Theorists&quot;, rather than having that as a sub-heading? [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 19:27, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, I was wondering whether the overall structure perhaps needs to be changed ever so slightly to make the Wikibook a bit neater? I was having a look at the page for Always-On Culture and the way they have their work arranged seems to make a bit more sense as well as making it far easier to read and navigate. Perhaps some of you could take a look at their page if you have a spare moment and tell me what you think about doing the same sort of thing with our page? [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 19:35, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I also agree about the content tab needing to be moved, however I am at a bit of a loss how to do that, so someone else might have to give that a shot. As far as pictures go, I think it would be nice to break up the content, but the only thing I can think of for pictures would be generic Google images of people using the internet or avatars, and I am not sure how much that would add to the page. Also, Claire, I wrote a bit of the SNSs section, so I will have a look at it and see what I can do. Do you have any suggestions as of yet though? [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 20:47, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

As for the Main Concepts Section I agree that it looks a bit odd that Theorists is a sub heading. Do you think we should move it to its own heading, maybe before the glossary, or even before the Cultural Theories section? It would make it a lot neater. As far as comparison the Always-On page, I think this page is inevitably going to look a bit more chaotic (and I am not saying it is too chaotic) as at the moment we have more content. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 20:52, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE ButtonsElizabeth''' I'm sure for the pictures there would be plenty of images used within our source material that would fit in nicely into any information we have taken from them, plus for the mention of certain sites (facebook etc.) we could just add in company logos to try and separate the text. Might be quite nice to add a picture of the theorists to their section, i do agree the theorists section should be moved too or come under it's own sub-heading anyway, it would flow a lot better with the layout.
[[User:Shayman1|Shayman1]] ([[User talk:Shayman1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shayman1|contribs]]) 21:59, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE ButtonsElizabeth'''Thanks so much for rearranging the SNS section, it looks much better now! [[User:Liisamy|Liisamy]] ([[User talk:Liisamy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liisamy|contribs]]) 13:46, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I think perhaps our page doesn't look as good as Always-On because we simply have more content, as Elizabeth has already mentioned. It's great stuff though, so we wouldn't be wanting to delete it. Perhaps if people can give their sections a quick scan to determine if some could be made more concise? Other than that, it's all pretty relevant so there's probably no harm keeping it. With pictures, we may have to be careful not to detract from the professional look of the page. Do you think company logos will be allowed or will there be copyright issues? Does anyone have any knowledge of rights we would need to attain to include certain images beside our text? [[User:BobblehatImara|BobblehatImara]] ([[User talk:BobblehatImara|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/BobblehatImara|contribs]]) 17:57, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Hi guys''' - George here from Always On - your stuff looks great! When I was doing my bit for our section I thought I could contribute a wee bit to your book from what I had found in my research - it relates to SNS and probably fits best with what you have headed up as 'Complications'. Here is what I've got re complications - if you're happy with it I can post it where I've suggested - or if you want to post it I can give you the references. Just let me know what you think. &quot;Jaron Lanier said that the most important thing about a technology was how it changed people (Lanier 2011) and warns of the restrictions of being ‘Locked-in’ to a particular technology. There is support for this concern in terms of online identity within social networks from Geert Lovink (Networks Without  A Cause: A Critique of Social Networks, 2011). He argues that there is little freedom to present yourself in different ways online and social networking sites only offer users a limited choice of presenting their personal and professional information to the world. He goes on to quote critic Zadie Smith who challenges this narrow choice forced on users by Facebook in saying, “What kind of living is this? Step back from your Facebook Wall for a moment:  doesn’t it, suddenly, look a little ridiculous? ''Your'' life in ''this'' format”. This seems to crystallise Lanier’s point about the problems with being Locked-in to a particular technology – our online identities – a presentation of our lives – force-fitted into a format to enable social networking sites to neatly package users’ information to monetise the content.&quot; Cheers.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 18:38, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Hi George''' I am happy for you to post it as we would have to reference it as your contributions anyway. And if it doesn't work we still have time to change it.

Hi everyone, i was wondering on peoples thoughts on where abouts on the Wikibook page I should place 'gaming.'

For now i have put it in the belonging section. It is clear to see that gaming allows a sense of belonging in online communities, however, gaming also has the ability to be under many other sections of the blog, as I'm not sure how well it fits in belonging.

Also, &lt;b&gt;RE:&lt;/b&gt;Group Presentation on Tuesday. As I understand it, we have to make the entire seminar as interesting and engaging as we can for the rest of the class and I thought that we could do this by using different kinds of tools throughout, for example using the online application, Prezi, to make our presentation - it's similar to powerpoint but is slicker and more modern. I also thought that we could use relevant Youtube videos &amp; maybe discuss real life examples that we had experienced with regard to online identity and maybe use one of our Facebooks as a source and example of how online identity is compared to our offline identity. Just some thoughts! :) I'll also let you know &lt;b&gt;Bianca&lt;/b&gt; :) [[User:Megan4pmGlasses|Megan4pmGlasses]] ([[User talk:Megan4pmGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Megan4pmGlasses|contribs]]) 14:20, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

[[User:SmithBiancaAnn|SmithBiancaAnn]] ([[User talk:SmithBiancaAnn|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SmithBiancaAnn|contribs]]) 14:26, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Prezi is a pretty good shout. Seems ''way'' better than Powerpoint. On top of our own experinces, we could ask the seminar group of theirs, and then relate them to each other, or academic research. [[User:Jack.oldfield|Jack.oldfield]] ([[User talk:Jack.oldfield|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jack.oldfield|contribs]]) 14:50, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I think the presentation sounds like a great idea, It will make it a lot more engaging for the rest of the seminar group to enjoy, once we sort out the presentation we should definitely look into what we should do as our seminar activity. maybe a group discussion incorporating what '''jack.oldfield''' said about the whole seminar's experiences? we should also get into making handouts as well whenever one of us has time.
[[User:Shayman1|Shayman1]] ([[User talk:Shayman1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shayman1|contribs]]) 14:59, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Prezi sounds like the way to go. We should also start looking for various multimedia elements we can include within the presentation, like Youtube videos and whatnot, like Megan said. I just wrote up an entry on reputation systems. [[User:Mattfinitejest|Mattfinitejest]] ([[User talk:Mattfinitejest|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mattfinitejest|contribs]]) 15:17, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE Getting up in front of the class and talking ONLINE IDENTITY!''' Prezi could be fun. Is it more user-friendly than Wiki? :/ LAWL I am so down for this idea. We could use one of our facebook's to really tease out differences from the online self and offline self. I am pretty loud online compared to my offline self (who isn't entirely mute)- with regard to playing to an audience (as I'm sure you'll know, girls) We could use the ideas represented in the presentation to hold a mirror up to the class and help them see deviations from their offline self, in their online self too - like perhaps gets some disclosure from them and accounts of their own online behavior? Personalising the seminar could make a really poignant point that will stick with the class and have them really engage with the topic. That's why I was drawn to it in the first place, online identity, through contemplating my own usage! Thoughts, crew? [[User:Kriscampbell91|Kriscampbell91]] ([[User talk:Kriscampbell91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kriscampbell91|contribs]]) 16:30, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I've never actually used Prezi, only seen it used, but I'd assume it's more user friendly than Wiki. And I'm definitely for the idea of personalizing elements of the discussion on online identity. Maybe use one of our profiles as an example and then invite the class to discuss/think about how their real-life selves differ from their online selves. [[User:Mattfinitejest|Mattfinitejest]] ([[User talk:Mattfinitejest|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mattfinitejest|contribs]]) 17:00, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Should we meet up soon then in order to create the slideshow and assign the roles for the presentation for the class? and would anyone like to nominate their facebook for an example to use? i don't think mine would be the best example to use, it's rare that i update it these days. I think it would be really good for after the presentation like '''Kris''' said to allow the class to look at themselves and let them look into how they act differently online than they do offline, that could then lead into a group discussion of what interesting points people managed to find? just a few ideas.
[[User:Shayman1|Shayman1]] ([[User talk:Shayman1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shayman1|contribs]]) 17:28, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Ok so should we start to delegate roles? I'm guessing that a lot of this may have to be split up and done over the weekend? I guess one person could collate all of the presentation info &amp; we all paste them our individual info on their discussion tab, another person could make handouts of that for the class, another could look on youtube or other sources for other resources that we could use, another could organize class discussion points and another could analyse how to use real life social media experience? [[User:Megan4pmGlasses|Megan4pmGlasses]] ([[User talk:Megan4pmGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Megan4pmGlasses|contribs]]) 10:32, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Yes AXERS. It's time, let's now get together and share the group presentation ideas we've been working on.''' We must Orchestrate, Delegate, &quot;Schedulate&quot;? I am happy to offer my Facebook for use, I would ask that someone, '''Megan''' maybe, log in and take the sufficient screen shots and elements from my Facebook as I am still on my 40 day social media hiatus. I can pass my login details but no monkey bidnezz! Just kidding. I think we should have a structured exercise which requires the class to analyse their own SNS activity - without forcing them to vocally disclose examples or 'outing' them if they prefer not to disclose. Enough that the exercise can have them engage in small groups and be able to reflect on the media we show them and in turn on themselves. They can perhaps reflect on the SNS examples we show them, have them try and identify some of the theoretical approaches we have discussed throughout the module i.e. disinhibition effect, multiplicity etc perhaps, and have them feedback? We can use multimedia sources (i.e. videos, blogs, vlogs etc) to introduce academic ideas and then have the class identify these in real live examples (our case study, and themselves) '''I am available before 1pm or after 5pm tomorrow. I've cancelled a trip to Glasgow to make this work so I sincerely hope you guys can try to make it to. We'll get a booth, we'll binge eat and talk Online Identity! Let me know.''' My number is on my userpage for you both. (Jack and Matt).

Definitely agree with the structured exercise - the class could look at each of their SNS, then look to see which one they use the most, and even which one they consider to be the 'truest' reflection of their offline identities, and why. [[User:Jack.oldfield|Jack.oldfield]] ([[User talk:Jack.oldfield|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jack.oldfield|contribs]]) 16:29, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

As I am sure most of you are aware, I will be home from Friday through till late on Monday so obviously I won’t be able to meet up to collaborate on how the presentation is going to run smoothly in class which is very annoying indeed ! But however, if we keep in contact via this wiki chat then I can be kept up to date and I am more than happy to make worksheets for the class so long as I know what you would all like me to put on them, that way it’s still a group thing and everyone gets a say. But everything looks great and you can also use my Facebook as well if you are wanting to maybe compare them to illustrate certain points. 
In terms of Prezzi, does it work like a sight in which we have to have an email and password to get on it, one which we would all have and use? If so this is helpful as I can edit it and add things to it from home. I shall also scope the web for illustrating pictures, YouTube videos, diagrams memes etc. Anything which I think will help get our point across and keep the class interested!

I think the most important things to take from Kris's facebook would mainly be profile pictures and different status', posts etc. that's what will show his online identity mostly, we can talk further when we meet up on monday, then once we've delegated all of the roles we could have a quick runthrough of our seminar plan on Tuesday just before we go in seen as it's at 4? i'll be free from about 12-4 anyway, If that sounds alright with people?

HI '''Kriscambell91''' I was just reading about your section on multiplicity and managed to find this great article covering the topic by a guy called Jonathan Vanasco, he has a lot of great things to say on the subject. http://www.destructuring.net/IdentityResearch/Essays/2007_11/01/2007-11-01--II_theory.html you can find it all there, I was wondering if i could edit your piece to incorporate some of what this writing is saying?

'''RE Shayman'''  Sean, the article reads really well. I would be okay with you editting and putting some of your ideas from this into the piece. I am working on the dishinibition effect specifically at the moment and will be adding this after the multiplicity section. Maybe we round off multiplicity on the potential  negative use of multiple identities to flow nicely into dishinibition effect. I've also noticed that under blended identities there has been a &quot;Multiple identities&quot; section written which will potentially just regurgitate what we have already started. Perhaps we can negotiate to collaborate all the efforts made on the multiplicity idea?.

'''RE Kriscambell''' Yeah that sounds good, i'll try to add in the negative effect in to make it flow nicely, It can be said that since so many social networks are linked these days through your accounts and email addresses it can be hard for someone to hide one online identity from others. If you think that would flow? or is there another angle you'd like me to take? yeah we should definitely discuss that with whoever wrote it, It would make sense not to repeat ourselves within the book.

'''RE Shayman''' I have posted in the SNS discussion section asking whoever wrote it if they would mind adding a sentence with the term multiplicity into their section as it is basically the core idea they are basing their content on. I think the page can work with both sections, as long as it marked that the SNS section is a social networking specific example of multiplicity. If the author doesn't see it first, I'm sure someone who co-authored the piece will allow it.

== Impression Managment ==

Hi, I don't know if I have written this right or in the right place. But I just read the section about Impression Managment-great bit by the way-but I noticed that there was a reference to 2006 and then 2014 but between that it says, &quot;12 years later.&quot; I just wasn't sure if that was an error or if I have missed something, but I thought I should let you know. [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 16:44, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Oh and sorry, just noticed that there is already a section for Impression Managment-oops [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 16:46, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

That was my section and my mistake. Just went back corrected it. I'm just awful at math. Thanks for catching it! [[User:Mattfinitejest|Mattfinitejest]] ([[User talk:Mattfinitejest|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mattfinitejest|contribs]]) 17:03, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

No Probs! Glad to help. Just wasn't sure if I had mis-read something. But I'm glad it was sorted [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 21:07, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE: Security and Privacy in Social Media:''' Not sure who wrote this but what was wondering if the sentence on its own that says &quot;This ties closely in to citizen journalism and blogging and both topics can be found in this chapter if the topic of Free Labour is one that you are researching.&quot; was suppose to be there?

==Straight Outta Compston's discussion==

Hi people! 
I thought we could use this section to discuss our project. --[[User:Rekarippel|Rekarippel]] ([[User talk:Rekarippel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rekarippel|contribs]]) 16:49, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Good idea, we'll have to copy over the discussions we've had on Facebook about it at some point. How are you getting on with your stuff? [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 17:06, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Not too bad, although given that the other groups seem to have covered all of the basics, it's a little tricky to find new areas for paragraphs... --[[User:JTCUoS|JTCUoS]] ([[User talk:JTCUoS|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JTCUoS|contribs]]) 17:10, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I'd suggest having a look at the Wikipedia article for Online Identity to give you ideas for topics. Then you can go off and research one of them from an angle that interests you. That's what I tried to do with my sections on Blended Identity. I've finished all of my contributions, so I won't be on here as frequently as I have been between now and the deadline, however, give me a shout if you need help with anything! [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 17:20, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Great idea guys! Jamie great work you have been doing, I kind of feel like I'm running out of topics to explore. Would it be bold if I added some psychological studies? I'm doing psych as my major after all.. :)--[[User:Eszter00|Eszter00]] ([[User talk:Eszter00|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Eszter00|contribs]]) 17:41, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I am almost done with my part guys, I will post it tonight, and if you feel you want to add something, I don't mind if you edit it.--[[User:Rekarippel|Rekarippel]] ([[User talk:Rekarippel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rekarippel|contribs]]) 17:43, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Re Eszter00''' Feel free to add some psychology stuff if you think that it's relevant to the topic of online identity. I think I'm right in saying that some people have already done a similar sort of thing? [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 17:50, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah I saw that, but I think I could take that further. Maybe. I will. Or my online self will. --[[User:Eszter00|Eszter00]] ([[User talk:Eszter00|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Eszter00|contribs]]) 17:57, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I don't want to give away anything, but guys I think I have some great ideas for our presentation! Excited yet? --[[User:Eszter00|Eszter00]] ([[User talk:Eszter00|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Eszter00|contribs]]) 18:12, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Ahhhhh, hello beautiful people. Discussion sounds great so far. Still trying to get to grips with this thing and could hardly remember my password hahaha  [[User:Thetallerandrew|Thetallerandrew]] ([[User talk:Thetallerandrew|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thetallerandrew|contribs]]) 18:31, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Psych theories sound great. Think it will broaden our topic into a great field of further studies! Our presentation does sound exciting. I think we can rock the class with it. &quot;Rock it til the waterfaaaall&quot; (Beyonce Reference there)[[User:Thetallerandrew|Thetallerandrew]] ([[User talk:Thetallerandrew|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thetallerandrew|contribs]]) 18:41, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Re Eszter00''' I think you should definitely add psychologycal studies that support the topic! It's always good if you can apply things you learned in your other modules. What do you have in mind?--[[User:Rekarippel|Rekarippel]] ([[User talk:Rekarippel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rekarippel|contribs]]) 23:37, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Re Eszter00''' Just out of interest - what section are you thinking about posting your psychology-based work in? [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 09:44, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Re SilentJamie''' The psychology work sounds a great addition. I've added quite a bit to the industries part, including adding a fashion industry section and a marketing and went on to descirbe how each have been influenced by the extent to which we are on always using technology.[[Special:Contributions/80.42.15.23|80.42.15.23]] ([[User talk:80.42.15.23|discuss]]) 23:35, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

===Presentation Discussion===

Just thought I'd make this little sub-section to keep our discussion about the presentations separate from the discussion about the Wikibook. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 17:39, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks Jamie! Since you won't be here this week, we will keep you updated about what we planned. Also you can let us know how you are getting on with your part. --[[User:Rekarippel|Rekarippel]] ([[User talk:Rekarippel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rekarippel|contribs]]) 23:40, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

No problem! I'll be sure to keep you updated. [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 09:00, 3 April 2014 (UTC)


Yeah we shall do  a lot of work on Sunday for the presentation and keep on track with the work that Jamie sent us on the chat thing. We can get plenty done in great time so that we can get a good presentation done [[Special:Contributions/80.42.15.23|80.42.15.23]] ([[User talk:80.42.15.23|discuss]]) 23:36, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Just curious as to what our current plans are for the presentation. Will we be displaying a powerpoint, or just handing out printout with slides on them? --[[User:JTCUoS|JTCUoS]] ([[User talk:JTCUoS|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JTCUoS|contribs]]) 08:45, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

'''RE JTCUoS''' Did you get the message I sent you on Facebook about this?

Yes, just received it a few minutes ago. Should have no problem in writing a paragraph or two on collaborating via Wikibooks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Motivation =
You want to access a web service that takes a JSON document as a query parameter using REST that returns a JSON document as a result.  This example uses Freebase, a popular open database that was purchase by Google.

= Basic Example =
We will create a Freebase query that will return the names of the first three albums with the artist ID: '/en/bob_dylan'.

We will use the EXPath http client library and send a HTTP GET request to the freebase server using a URI to encode our query.

== Sample Code ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;3.0&quot;;

let $freebase:=&quot;https://www.googleapis.com/freebase/v1/mqlread?query=&quot;

let $queries:= 
   (
     '[{
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;/music/album&quot;,
        &quot;name&quot;:null,
        &quot;artist&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/en/bob_dylan&quot;},
        &quot;limit&quot;:3
      }]','cursor'
   )
 
let $responses := http:send-request(&lt;http:request
     href=&quot;{$freebase || string-join(for $q in $queries return encode-for-uri($q),'&amp;amp;')}&quot;
     method=&quot;get&quot;/&gt;)
                           
return
&lt;results&gt;
  {if ($responses[1]/@status ne '200')
     then
         &lt;failure&gt;{$responses[1]}&lt;/failure&gt;
     else
       &lt;success&gt;
         {util:base64-decode($responses[2])}
         {'' (: todo - use string to JSON serializer lib here :) }
       &lt;/success&gt;
  }
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample Results ==
The result returned is a string in JSON format.  I have added spaces to show the structure of the result
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;success&gt;
     {&quot;cursor&quot;: &quot;eNp9js1qxDAMhB-ml5hiVrKUWBJl6XuYHNz80EBJQtIuyz59nW7p3joXgUajb7qvbV82ix2wpcWoTbMhREIAZWrz3NsT-LIBFmkILVha99txuFwM2mqcrkNv9-GnPRtJYCmJhjU2wsE-Xnx1mVZTFWTS8PgWbHvWACFLwQOUCI4Cv0LMg_SDPzdYK2oQl96n-bMwnasO0E-toygz_UFQaqbA9PD4P8hdnT8fOaiFnEvrthTICZGCgp5e45tGZB6ZQKJmBCSAbyilTh0=&quot;,
   &quot;result&quot;: 
   [
      {
         &quot;artist&quot;: {&quot;id&quot;: &quot;/en/bob_dylan&quot;}, 
         &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;, 
         &quot;type&quot;: &quot;/music/album&quot;
       },
       {
         &quot;artist&quot;: {&quot;id&quot;: &quot;/en/bob_dylan&quot;},
         &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Love and Theft&quot;,
         &quot;type&quot;: &quot;/music/album&quot;
       },
       {
           &quot;artist&quot;: {&quot;id&quot;: &quot;/en/bob_dylan&quot;}, 
           &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;,
           &quot;type&quot;: &quot;/music/album&quot;
       }
   ]}
   &lt;/success&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Freebase API Key ==
Here is a link to a blog that  describes the process of obtaining a Freebase API key

http://anchetawern.github.io/blog/2013/02/11/getting-started-with-freebase-api/

= Using Cursors to Get Additional Data =
The default freebase query limits the number of results returned. Freebase provides database cursors to facilitate retrieval of the entire set of query results. You ask for a cursor (see the example API call below for
the form of the initial request) to be returned with your query results and this acts as a link to the next set of query results.

https://developers.google.com/freebase/v1/mql-overview#querying-with-cursor-paging-results

The next set of results is obtained by supplying the value of the cursor returned from the previous invocation. Along with that next set you get another cursor that points to the set after that. When the final set of results are retrieved the cursor is set to the string 'false'.

The example on the Freebase query overview webpage has sample Python code that invokes libraries to take care of all
the cursor handling for you.

https://developers.google.com/freebase/v1/mql-overview#looping-through-cursor-results

However the same thing can easily be achieved from XQuery with a little bit of tail recursion. We will use as an example the following MQL query that returns all films with their netflix_id's.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
[{
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;/film/film&quot;,
  &quot;name&quot;: null,
  &quot;netflix_id&quot;: []
}]
&lt;/source&gt;

A few brief comments about MQL. You ask for something by giving the field name and a value null. Null gets replaced by the actual value. However if the field can have multiple values MQL will return an array and cause your null query to error. This may happen even when you are expecting a singular value so you can avoid this problem by using the
symbol for an empty array instead of null as in the query above.

You can paste the query above into http://www.freebase.com/query to see the results (we will take care of the cursor in the code example). Now to the code, which assumes XQuery 3.0

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;3.0&quot;;
import module namespace xqjson=&quot;http://xqilla.sourceforge.net/lib/xqjson&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Freebase returns JSON  so we use the above package to convert it to XML. From eXist you can install the package by just clicking it on the eXist Package Manager which you can get to from the eXist Dashboard.

We declare a variable for our query.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare variable $mqlQuery {'[{
   &quot;type&quot;: &quot;/film/film&quot;,
  &quot;name&quot;: null,
  &quot;netflix_id&quot;: []
}]'};

declare variable $freebase {'https://www.googleapis.com/freebase/v1/mqlread'};
declare variable $key {obtain an API key from freebase and puts it's value here'};
&lt;/source&gt;

Since we are going to be doing tail recursion we need to put the API call in a function that will will make the API call and store the results in the db.

   declare function local:freebaseCall($cursor as xs:string,$i as xs:integer)

This function will take two parameters.  The first is the cursor and the second an integer that provisions an auto-incremented unique file name.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:freebaseCall($cursor as xs:string, $i as xs:integer)
{
  if ($cursor eq 'false')

    (: termination condition :)
    then $i || ' pages loaded'
    else

     let $params :=  ('query=' || encode-for-uri($mqlQuery), 'key=' ||
       $key, 'cursor=' || encode-for-uri($cursor))

     (: Above uri encodes the parameters to the API call - we have three the
       MQL query, the API key and the cursor :)

      let $href := $freebase || '?' || string-join($params, '&amp;amp;')

     (: This constructs the API call - again thanks to Michael Westbay for
      showing the correct way to do this by string joining the parameters
      with a separator of &amp;amp; :)

     let $responses :=
       http:send-request(&lt;http:request href=&quot;{$href}&quot; method=&quot;get&quot;/&gt;)
      (: Make the API call. :)

    return
        if ($responses[1]/@status ne '200')
            then &lt;failure
                   href=&quot;{xmldb:decode-uri(xs:anyURI($href))}&quot;&gt;{$responses[1]}
                &lt;/failure&gt;
            else

        let $jsonResponse:= util:base64-decode($responses[2])
        (: Standard EXPATH http error checking - don't forget to base64 decode
           the body of the response.
         :)

         let $freebaseXML:= xqjson:parse-json($jsonResponse)

    (: Convert the returned JSON to XML because we are going to construct an
       http PUT to store it in our xml db. :)

      let $movieData := http:send-request(
         &lt;http:request
            href=&quot;{concat(path to store the data in your repostiory,$i,'.xml')}&quot;
               username=&quot;username&quot;
               password=&quot;password&quot;
               auth-method=&quot;basic&quot;
               send-authorization=&quot;true&quot;
               method=&quot;put&quot;&gt;
              &lt;http:header name=&quot;Connection&quot; value=&quot;close&quot;/&gt;
              &lt;http:body media-type=&quot;application/xml&quot;/&gt;              
          &lt;/http:request&gt;,
          (),
          &lt;batch cursor=&quot;{$cursor}&quot;&gt;{transform:transform($freebaseXML,doc(identity.xsl'),())}
          &lt;/batch&gt;)

         (: Standard EXPATH PUT request. On the last line we are wrapping the
            returned XML with an element that carries the value of the cursor that
            was used to obtain the page. Identity.xsl is of course the standard
            XSLT identity transform, you can use it as a placeholder for the
            insertion of your own custom transform.
         :)

          return local:freebaseCall($freebaseXML//data(pair[@name=&quot;cursor&quot;]), $i + 1)

         (: Finally the tail recursive call. We extract the cursor from the
            returned JSON for parameter 1 and increment $i to give us a unique
            document name for the next page to store.

};
&lt;/source&gt;

To kick it all off pass the null string as the initial cursor value and initialise your counter

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   local:freebaseCall('',1)
&lt;/source&gt;

Alternatively you can prime the function call with a cursor to restart retrieval from where you left off. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   local:freebaseCall($freebaseXML//data(pair[@name=&quot;cursor&quot;]), $i + 1)};
&lt;/source&gt;

      <comment>/* Bang-bang = just the sign of the frequency difference */ Good link completed</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Many practical (slave) clock recovery circuits with a PLL architecture require some type of frequency acquisition aid. 

Exceptions are only found where  very stable VCOs, such as crystal oscillators, are used to insure that the frequency error is never larger than the natural acquisition range of the PLL          ( a range that is close to the PLL closed-loop bandwidth ). 

Excluding these stable VCOs, and other acquisition aids, such as frequency sweeping, a frequency discriminator is required as an integral part of any phase-detector for modern monolithic CDRs (&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard C. Walker article&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omnisterra.com/walker/pdfs.papers/BBPLL.pdf|title=Designing Bang-Bang PLLs for Clock and Data Recovery in Serial Data Transmission Systems|author=Richard C. Walker|year=2003|publisher= pp. 34-45, a chapter appearing in &quot;Phase-Locking in High-Performance Sytems - From Devices to Architectures&quot;, edited by Behzad Razavi, IEEE Press, 2003, ISBN 0-471-44727-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; pages 259..260 ).



===Frequency (comparison and) detection===
A serial stream of NRZ data arriving at a pulse frequency f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is not distinguishable form a stream at 2f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; made of pairs of identical pulses, nor from a stream at 3f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; made of triplets of identical pulses.
[[File:100 percent frequency uncertainty.pdf|center|600px|A serial NRZ stream of data can be regenerated with a clock at frequency f, or 2f, or 3f, or higher multiple.#A serial NRZ stream of data can be regenerated with a clock at frequency f, or 2f, or 3f, or higher multiple.]]
Some additional information about the absolute value of f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is necessary to correctly recover clock and data. Since the uncertainty comes in steps of 100% of f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, an indication of f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;  with an approximation of +/- 50% is  (barely) sufficient.

In practical CDR applications the uncertainty is always contained within ± 25%  and in most cases within ±5% (most of this uncertainty comes from the inaccuracy of the VCO free running frequency) . Additional circuitry that can detect the frequency of the incoming data in that range will be adequate, as it will be shown.

::&lt;small&gt;In frequency synthesisers the problem of frequency aided acquisition is equally important as in CDRs, but in synthesisers the incoming signal and the local clock are both perfectly periodic waveforms and a phase and frequency detector with a simple architecture can be used &lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhas.ac.id/rhiza/arsip/research-stuffs/Phase-Locked/218-PhaseDetector-2.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;. A straight forward comparison of the respective cycle period is possible, and effective. On the other hand, synthesizers often require capture ranges well in excess of +/- 25%.&lt;/small&gt;

::&lt;small&gt;In CDRs instead, the missing transitions of the incoming signal make the frequency comparison with the local clock a more complex affair.&lt;/small&gt;




====Need for frequency detection (in addition to phase detection) in CDRs====

A loop filter is inserted between phase comparator and VCO, in CDRs where jitter and noise performances are important [[Clock and Data Recovery/Introduction/Models can only be linear..#Just three architectures are of practical use|(Architectures 2 - 1 and  2 - 2)]].

Both for architectures 2-1 and 2-2, when high transmission speed is involved, a jitter-out / jitter-in bandwidth of about 1/1000 of the bit rate  is specified by most standards &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tek.com/document/primer/clock-recovery-primer-part-2| Clock Recovery Primer, Part 2 by Guy Foster, par.10: Survey of Clock Recovery Used in Selected Standards]&lt;/ref&gt;. 
::&lt;small&gt;The &quot;jitter-out /jitter-in&quot; bandwidth, called &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; in the modeling of these 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; order loops, is therefore specified and made by design to be around  &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;/1000 ( &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the angular frequency of the pulses of the received stream, 2&amp;pi; f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/small&gt;
A significant ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; / &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; mismatch (much larger than the capture range) is often the case, in particular in '''large volume, cost-effective monolithic implementation, where the VCO free-running angular frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; is no more accurate than about +/- 5%''' ( ICs manufacturing tolerances are not tighter than ± 25 %, but recourse to end-of-production trimming can correct them and reduce the inaccuracy range to something like within ± 5 % ).
::&lt;small&gt;The accuracy of f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is not the problem in modern networks,  where it is better than +/- 50 ppm. It is the poor accuracy of the VCO free-running frequency  f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; that makes the aid to the acquisition necessary. ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 &amp;pi; f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;; ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;  = 2 &amp;pi; f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;There are many more slave nodes than master nodes in a network, and the master nodes are more critical than the slaves. A larger cost (-&gt; including a tighter accuracy) can be afforded for the masters, making ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; ''-that originates in a master node-'' (much) more accurate than ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; ''-that originates in a slave receiver-''.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Without aids the the capture range of the CDR is approximately coincident with +/-( jitter-in / jitter-out bandwidth) around the free-running frequency of the VCO.&lt;/u&gt; 

If the free-running frequency is so shifted (away from the incoming pulse frequency) that the capture range does not include the frequency of the data to lock into, the phase comparator alone cannot make the acquisition possible.
::&lt;small&gt;The data transitions pass in front of the local clock faster than it can shift its frequency to catch one of them, with no chance to achieve phase lock.&lt;/small&gt; 
::&lt;small&gt;In fact, these CDRs react in a time of about 1/(2 times the the capture range), and a new input transition shifts inside the range of the phase comparator (while the previous one drifts away), before a significant part of that time has elapsed.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;The PLL goes through alternate periods of accelerating and decelerating, with slips in between, but never achieves phase lock.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;Sometimes, when ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is close to ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; ± ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt;, a series of slips may eventually end in a good phase lock. The acquisition may be achieved but with slips and unpredictably long times.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;Aided acquisition is then mandatory.&lt;/small&gt;

In such cases the acquisition must be aided by ''additional'' circuits that widen the capture range.
::&lt;small&gt;Inside a complex equipment another clock with good enough accuracy may be available. A frequency close to f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; can be easily synthesized, and a frequency detector of clock differences can be used. Its output will be summed to the CDR PD output.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;There have been also cases where frequency sweeping was used to have the capture range overlap f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;Note that the VCO must be driven by a unique signal, even if the drive signal is obtained by combination of two separate ones. (A VCO with two inputs is a &quot;bad idea&quot; within the scope of stable control systems, see also &lt;ref name=&quot;Buchwald free book&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mobius-semiconductor.com/whitepapers/IntegratedFiberOpticReceivers_crop.pdf |title=Integrated Fiber-Optic Receivers|author = Aaron BUCHWALD Hong Kong University of Science &amp; Technology, Kenneth W. MARTIN University of Toronto Toronto, Ontario, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; at page 261).&lt;/small&gt;

Tight jitter bandwidth and wide acquisition range can be achieved together if the CDR includes a [[w:Phase frequency detector|Frequency Detector (FD)]] in addition to its [[w:Phase detector|Phase Detector  (PD)]], as it is often the case&lt;ref&gt;Behzad Razavi, Design of Monolithic Phase-Locked Loops and Clock Recovery Circuits-A Tutorial, 4.6 Aided Acquisition, downloadable at: http://itee.uq.edu.au/~coms3100/coms3100/Lecture%20Notes/Razavi1996_PLL_IEEExplore.PDF &lt;/ref&gt;. 
::&lt;small&gt;Sometimes a separate FD for CDRs is used in parallel to the PD, but this is a rare occurrence.&lt;/small&gt;

The two blocks are normally physically and functionally combined, and the overall block/function is named [[w:Phase detector#Phase-frequency detector|phase-frequency detector]] PFD, which also offers the benefit of automatic transition from the operation of the one to the other as soon as lock is achieved.

A PFD may incorporate one to two linear PDs, but more often incorporates bang-bang PD(s) &lt;ref&gt;S. Tontisirin and R. Tielert, 2.5 Gbps clock data recovery using 1/4th-rate quadricorrelator frequency detector and skew-calibrated multi-phase clock generator, Adv. Radio Sci., 4, 287–291, 2006   http://www.adv-radio-sci.net/4/287/2006/ars-4-287-2006.pdf  © Author(s) 2006. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons License. Advances in Radio Science &lt;/ref&gt;. 

The bang-bang structure of the PFD in practical applications is a consequence of the application requirements. It will be shown that the (bang-bang) PFD is used in CDRs of the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Applications of the 2nd order type 2 architecture|2-2 type]], that are made with bang-bang phase detectors. 
:&lt;small&gt;Architectures of the 2-1 type normally find application in association with accurate VCOs, and architectures of the 1-1 type are used for phase aligners that have a perfectly accurate local clock by definition.&lt;/small&gt;

The frequency detection in practical applications is part of a monolithic implementation of the CDR, working at the highest speed that the chip technology allows. Then the implementation will be based on discrete time instants and binary signal levels, as mentioned already for PDs&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard C. Walker article&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omnisterra.com/walker/pdfs.papers/BBPLL.pdf|title=Designing Bang-Bang PLLs for Clock and Data Recovery in Serial Data Transmission Systems|author=Richard C. Walker|year=2003|publisher= pp. 34-45, a chapter appearing in &quot;Phase-Locking in High-Performance Sytems - From Devices to Architectures&quot;, edited by Behzad Razavi, IEEE Press, 2003, ISBN 0-471-44727-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
:&lt;small&gt;To reinforce the general validity of the above point, another aspect of the IC industry must be appreciated. When a new, faster chip technology appears, it will be used to create new CDRs at higher speed, as the mentioned paper&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard C. Walker article&quot; /&gt; emphasizes. But this new technology will NOT be used for a redesign of the CDRs made in an earlier technology pushing that technology to its speed limit. The semiconductor industry is always short of good designers, and at the same time it is difficult to replicate exactly the performances of an IC in a different, though older, technology. Additionally, customers are reluctant to undergo again the cost of chip qualification. Scarcity of design resources, risk of not making a good replica and customer reluctance for a re-qualification, all cooperate to the result that a successful mixed-signal chip is practically never redesigned. This also implies that architectural alternatives of an existing solution (that  become possible with the appearance of a later and faster technology) are practically never implemented!&lt;/small&gt;


In a CDR the Frequency Detector must accomplish a very basic, simple task: bring the VCO frequency close enough to the pulse frequency of the incoming signal, so that the Phase Detector can take effect and drive the phase lock. 

Simple tasks mean simple requirements: '''the Frequency Detector''' need not be linear, need not offer the highest gain possible, it shall j'''ust ensure a reasonably fast frequency acquisition for realistic frequency differences''' and must become unnoticeable as soon as the Phase Detector is able to take over. The important performance of the CDR are influenced by the PD, not by the FD: the FD is just required not to limit the PD performances. 


&lt;u&gt;The PFD used in CDRs are of the '''bang-bang''' type. The FD function is active outside of the frequency range where the PD can capture the incoming signal, and the FD effect disappears completely as soon as the PD function can take over.&lt;/u&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;This is why the Frequency Detector is normally neglected in modeling and often also in simulation of the CDRs.&lt;/small&gt;

===Methods of frequency detection in CDR===
Many different types of PFD for CDR can be conceived, with different levels of complexity and performance.
:&lt;sub&gt;As explained in the previous paragraph, the '''PFD for CDR''' is actually implemented in the '''simplest possible form'''.&lt;/sub&gt;


It has been shown earlier that to detect a '''phase difference''' in the CDR, the transitions of the data signal are compared with the transitions of '''one clock'''.

To detect a '''frequency difference''' f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; - f&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;, the transitions of the data signal shall be compared with the transitions of '''two clocks''' of '''equal frequency''' (f&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;VCO&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) that just have a '''constant phase distance'''. (= difference):
&lt;center&gt;{{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ( ''φ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ''  -  ''φ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) '' )  /  (''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' -  ''t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}&lt;/center&gt;

::# &lt;small&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; shall have a fixed phase distance inside the VCO cycle.&lt;/small&gt;

====Two comparators====
In the right hand side of the last equation,  the two  differences of the nominator have been highlighted with bold characters and underlined.

They represent  the outputs of two phase comparators, the first comparing the data transitions with transitions (&amp;nbsp;of a VCO clock&amp;nbsp;) in t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; , and the second comparing the data transitions with transitions (&amp;nbsp;of a second -shifted- VCO clock&amp;nbsp;) in t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; .

:&lt;small&gt;Each individual phase difference will vary with time, and indicate a constant frequency difference if it exhibits a cyclic behavior, but neither alone can tell the sign of the frequency difference!&lt;/small&gt;

Combining the results of the two comparisons together it is possible to identify also the sign of the frequency difference.
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; color: grey; width:auto; margin-left:em8; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;
:::&lt;small&gt;''( Provided the two clocks do not differ in phase exactly by 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; nor by 180&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;: the frequency difference signal would be completely attenuated in those two extreme cases! ''&lt;br&gt;
:::''The two phase comparators -different just because their two versions of the VCO clock are separated by 0° or by 180°- would always produce either coincident results or always complementary results, i.e. the very same information!''&lt;/small&gt;
:::&lt;small&gt;Note that phase comparators used in CDRs have a characteristic that is periodic with an odd symmetry and that is growing and monotonic inside each period.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
The best discrimination (= the most robust signal) is obtained when the distance between the two identical comparators is chosen to be exactly 90&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; (or 270&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;).


====Two clocks with 50% duty-cycle and separated by 90°====
Two clocks with 50% duty-cycle and orthogonal with each other (that is 90&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; or &amp;pi;/2 out of phase) make the two phase comparators divide all the 360&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; of their period into 4 quadrants.

The two phase comparators together indicate the quadrant where the data signal transition is located, and this info can be updated at every new data transition.

IRE, 42:106–133, January 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.E.Allen, June  26 2003,  Lecture 200 - Clock and Data Recovery Circuits  from ECE 6440, page 200-15..17, http://users.ece.gatech.edu/pallen/Academic/ECE_6440/Summer_2003/L200-CDR-I(2UP).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;In the same paper Donald Richman first introduced the term &quot;quadricorrelator&quot; applying PFD to NTSC color carrier detection in color television and describing an analog version of the circuit that uses both '''an In-phase and a Quadrature clock''' to obtain a beat note at double frequency and a d.c. component proportional to the frequency difference. (Quadrants defined with Phase and &lt;u&gt;Quadrature&lt;/u&gt; clocks, hence the name quadricorrelator). Although the quadricorrelator operation may not be very good with the random transitions of a NRZ data stream without some modifications (&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchwald free book&quot; /&gt; page 269), the I and Q technique is good also for CDR PFDs.&lt;/small&gt;

*  I (lag in the figure), is the reference and defines with its positive transition the 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; instants. I stands for In-phase; &lt;small&gt;''(When PD and FD are combined and part of a CDR, then I is the clock used for data regeneration).''&lt;/small&gt;
* Q (lead by 90° in the figure) identifies the -90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; or 270&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;instants. Q stands for &quot;Quadrature&quot;.
[[Image:I and Q instants and time intervals.png|thumb|center|700px|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Two synchronous clocks, 90 degrees distant from each other, divide each period T in two intervals, 1/4 T and 3/4 T.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;If the two clocks have 50% duty cycle, using their negative transitions, all 4 quadrants can be identified.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;I is the reference, In-phase clock, Q leads I by 90 degrees.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
::&lt;small&gt;Before lock, the data transitions shift with respect to the two clocks.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;When a data transition is first detected inside the interval &quot;I leads Q&quot; and then detected inside the interval &quot;Q leads I&quot;, the data transitions are shifting to the left.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;The data transitions are therefore based on a frequency lower than the frequency of the two clocks.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;In such condition, the VCO of a PLL shall be driven towards a lower frequency, that is with a lower level of the VCO drive signal.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;When a data transition is first detected inside the interval &quot;Q leads I&quot; and then inside the interval &quot;I leads Q&quot;, the data transitions are shifting to the right.&lt;/small&gt; 
::&lt;small&gt;The data transitions are then based on a frequency higher than the frequency of the two clocks.&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;In such condition, the VCO of a PLL shall be driven towards a higher frequency, that is with a higher level of the VCO drive signal.&lt;/small&gt;
If the two '''I and Q clocks have both 50% duty cycle''', using also their negative transitions, '''all 4 quadrants''' can be '''identified'''.
::&lt;small&gt;The frequency sign can be obtained each time the data transitions, after a detection in a given quadrant, cause a detection in a quadrant to the left (f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; lags f&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;), or to the right. (f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; leads f&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;

====Bang-bang = just the sign of the frequency difference====
The PFD is mostly used for [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/Applications of the 2nd order type 2 architecture|monolithic CDRs made with the 2 - 2 architecture]], where the Phase Detector is of the bang-bang type.

Therefore the PFD will be of the bang-bang type as well.

# the two PDs of the PFD are of the bang-bang type to start with. Their outputs only give one bit indication. The nominator in the PFD formula is reduced to a sigle bit as well. ''(Or to a &quot;ternary&quot; type of output, if the overall CDR needs minimum jitter generation).''
# the time difference in the denominator of the PFD formula is a fixed fraction of the local clock (=VCO) cycle. It has always a positive sign, even if it may vary (inversely) with the VCO frequency. Therefore it is disregarded in a bang-bang PFD (replaced by a constant +1).
In other words, the PFD will just output an indication as simple (&amp;nbsp;'''binary or ternary'''&amp;nbsp;) as the phase detector that operates on its I clock.

===How a bang-bang PFD is made ===
It is made up of two PDs and one final block that processes the outputs of the two PDs.

One PD operates on the input data stream and on the VCO clock that shall be locked to the data. This clock is called the I (= In phase) clock.

The other PD operates on the input data stream and on a VCO clock that is 90°, i.e. &amp;pi;/2, out of phase with the previous one. This clock is called the Q (= Quadrature) clock. It could be be +90° or -90° out of phase with I : let's choose here +90°, which means that the Q waveform lags the I waveform.

In a typical example, the two outputs from the two PDs are put together in a following block that is essentially the same as the output stage of the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR phase comparator#Bang-bang Phase Detector with “hold”|&quot;hold&quot; bang-bang PD]].
[[File:Bang-bang Phase and Frequency Detector.png|thumb|center|850px|&lt;center&gt;The scheme of principle of a bang-bang PFD for CDRs.&lt;/center&gt;]]

This structure works with signals as follows:
* the clocks of the first PD are:
:# the clock that regenerates the data and
:# its 180° shifted version
* the clocks of the second PD are both shifted versions of CK&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; that regenerates the data, respectively:
:# by 90° and
:# by 270°,
which partitions the VCO period into the four quadrants already mentioned.

The two clocks of each PD are 180° out of phase with each other.

The outputs of the two PDs are combined in a final stage identical to the final stage of the &quot;hold&quot; PD: this PFD becomes a &quot;hold&quot; (= binary) PFD.

The output of the PFD may be present a polarity inversion if:
# the shift of the Q clock of the second PD is -90° instead of +90° with respect to the clock I (the other clocks do not matter, as +180° is indistinguishable from -180°);
# the final stage either uses an inversion after the top flip-flop or an inversion after the bottom flip-flop.

An example of the waveforms in case of a constant frequency difference is shown in the following figure (note the inversion of the PFD output):
[[File:Bang-bang PFD with constant input difference.png|thumb|900px|center|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Simulation (with 3000 time points) of the waveforms inside a Phase and Frequency Detector of the bang-bang type.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;The detector is driven by one clock (input +) at 1 GHz (i.e. D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = 100%) and by another clock (input -) at 1GHz-398 ppm.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;After 1850 simulation samples, the input clock becomes noisy with the addition of a sinusoidal phase jitter of 0.3 rad of amplitude and of 10e+10 rad/sec of angular frequency.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Note the typical pattern of the slips of the outputs of the two Phase Detectors driven by I(lead) and Q(lag), that are orthogonal square waves separated by 1/4 of the beat period.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;The wave of the Q (lag) detector seems to lead the other: this is because the frequency difference is negative.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;This PFD is wired so that its output is low if the negative input receives a lower frequency than the positive input, and viceversa.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;In many cases the output polarity is the opposite.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
This system is a discrete time system with samples at frequency f&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;, and a data transition should be sampled  at least once every time it drifts through one of the four quadrants. Each drift trough a quadrant should last at least 1/ (4f&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;).

A data transition has been sampled inside one quadrant.
The following data transition (D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = 100%), while the data stream drifts across the quadrants defined by Q and I, should preferably be sampled (at least once) inside each quadrant.
The sampling takes place if  the period of 1/f&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt; stays inside the range 1/&lt;sub&gt;fp&lt;/sub&gt; +/- 25%.

D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is normally lower than 100%. The maximum Δf that this type of PFD can detect is ±25%, even if the technique of &quot;hold&quot;ing the detection when no transition is present could extend the theoretical range to ±50%.

If the frequency difference to detect is in the range of ±15% or larger, then it is preferable that the two PDs  artificially '''&quot;hold&quot;''' the previous detection of the phase until a new significant detection can be made, and that the FD does the same ('''Binary PFD'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard C. Walker article&quot;  /&gt; ).

If instead the frequency difference to detect does not exceed ±10%, then the two PDs might still be of the &quot;hold&quot; type, but the last PFD stage would be improved to a '''&quot;free running&quot;''' type ('''Ternary PFD''' &lt;ref name=&quot;Richard C. Walker article&quot;  /&gt;).

::&lt;small&gt;The feature can be obtained in principle by a retrofit that:&lt;/small&gt;
::*  &lt;small&gt;extracts also the T signal from the PD operating on the I clock&lt;/small&gt;
::*  &lt;small&gt;drives the [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The CDR phase comparator#The charge pump inside a PLL comparator for clock and data recovery|charge pump]] following the PFD output with the two signals:   &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;UP&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; + E  ;  DOWN = T*E.&lt;/small&gt;

It is presented again here with identical behavior, but using a different set of circuit symbols that better represent the circuit elements of a high-frequency integrated circuit.

High frequency circuits are fully differential for noise immunity, making a signal and its complement always available together. Exchanging one wire with the other of a differential pair corresponds to the inversion of the signal: no inverter stage is needed. Multiplexers are easy to implement. Two flip-flops and a multiplexer make up a double edge triggered flip-flop DETFF.

In this case, the two DETFFs allow the use of clocks at half the frequency because both edges of the clocks are used (clocks must have 50% duty cycle). 

The clocks that drive the two flip-flops, are indicated as the I (lead) and Q (lag, i.e. 90° late) clock phases coming out of an oscillator that runs at half the data pulse frequency. They are equivalent to two clocks of double frequency and separated by 180°. 

This anticipates the incorporation of two of these PDs in a PFD that uses their outputs to detect the sign of the frequency difference, in a CDR that uses a muli-phase VCO at half the frequency.

[[Image:Phase Detector using DETFFs and clocks I (lead) and Q (lag) at f 2.pdf|thumb|center|850px|&lt;center&gt;A bang-bang PD with output held fixed if the incoming data miss one or more transitions, rendering the PD gain independent from the transition density.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The output of the first DTEFF carries the regenerated data, the output of the second DETFF carries the cross-over samples taken at the instant when a data transition is expected.

It may be noted that this PD is made up of three DETFFs, but the third is slightly modified with an inversion at the output of its upper flip-flop.

This inversion in the upper branch of the last stage sends to the output:
*the last cross-over sample when the data have a positive transition (and as long as they stay high);
*the opposite of the last cross-over sample when the data have a negative transition (and as long as they stay low).

Inverting on negative transitions and not inverting on positive ones makes the PD output go high if the clock lags the data, and viceversa.



=====A bang-bang PFD with reduced VCO frequency for easier implementation inside an IC&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchwald free book&quot; /&gt;=====
The following figure redraws the PFD presented earlier changing two aspects:
* the elementary blocks of high frequency monolithic circuits are used (DETFF, differential connections and the multiplexer),
* the input clocks come from a VCO at half the frequency.

''A very similar one, just with I that lags Q, is described in &lt;ref&gt;Jafar Savoj and Behzad Razavi, A 10Gb/s CMOS Clock and Data Recovery Circuit with Frequency Detection, ISCC 2001&lt;/ref&gt;.''
[[File:Phase and Frequency Detector PFD.jpg|thumb|center|800px|&lt;center&gt;A bang-bang PFD that can be driven by a VCO at f/2&lt;br&gt;The inversion placed on the upper flip-flop of the final stage causes the PFD to a high output if the VCO frequency is lower than the data frequency, and viceversa.&lt;br&gt;The inversion on the lower flip-flop would cause a low PFD output when f&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;  f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and a high output when f&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;  f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;]]
The Q clock lags the I by 90°. When acquisition is achieved, CK&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;( i.e. I) is where it should be. The PD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will output a constant 1, because Q is late by exactly 90° and should accelerate.

But in this condition the output of PD&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is replicated at the output of the PFD and drives the PLL alone. PD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; remains constantly at 1, phase-locked into its 90° lag state by the PLL operation.

Otherwise said, when the PFD is part of a CDR that reaches the phase lock, its output replicates the output (or the inverted output) of the PD that acts as clock of the PFD final stage.

This means inverting the output of the top flip-flop in the final stage if the second PD uses a clock 90° late (like in the waveforms below and in the schematic of the figure above), and inverting the output of the bottom flip-flop in the final stage if the second PD uses a clock that is 90° early. 

The figures that follow represent the waveforms at the external connections as well as at the internal nodes of one PFD like in the figure above.

The first figure describes the case of an input signal with the highest possible DT (i.e. 100% and a data pattern 101010..).

The second figure describes the case of an input signal with a random data pattern.

In both cases the clocks (nominally at half frequency) and the input data of the PFD  correspond to frequency ratios different from the nominal value of 50%.

In the case of maximum transition density (in spite of a large frequency difference) the waveforms are as regular as it could be expected. The two phase detectors toggle at the beat frequency, and overlap each other transitions.

The PFD output (almost) immediately reaches a stable indication of the sign of the frequency difference. In a closed loop this means the fastest possible acquisition transient.

[[File:Bang-bang PFD waveforms constant Df random input.png|thumb|center|900px|&lt;center&gt;Waveforms inside a bang-bang Phase and Frequency Detector for CDR use.&lt;br&gt;The PFD receives a random data NRZ input and the 4 phases of a clock at f/2&lt;br&gt;with a constant frequency difference between the data frequency and (twice) the clock frequency.&lt;/center&gt;]]
With a random pattern of the received pulses, the waveforms are much less regular.

As a result, the PFD output is far from stable, but at least its average deviates from 50% enough to give a clear indication of the frequency difference.

Every time the generation and recording of these waveforms are repeated, the figure for 101010 data is practically the same.

The figure for random input data instead changes significantly with the change of the sample of the input pattern, but the average value of the PFD output, although variable as well, remains on the correct side of 50%.

===Acquisition of Frequency and Phase Lock===
The following example refers to a CDR with a 2 -2 architecture, incorporating a PFD like the one described in the previous paragraph.


[[File:Bang-bang PFD acquisition.png|thumb|center|1024px|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Simulation of the acquisition phase of a PLL 2nd order type 2 with a bang-bang Phase and Frequency Detector.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
The figure is obtained by a simulation with 3000 time steps.

The waveforms of the two Phase Detectors are shown at the top, translated higher not to overlap the analog waveforms.
::&lt;small&gt;Neither the line pulse sequence nor its frequency are used in the simulation of the waveforms of the voltages and angular values depicted.&lt;/small&gt; 
::&lt;small&gt;Therefore the Q clock operation is simulated by the trick of replicating at the PD2 input the input signal phase with a 90° shift (= delay, Q lags I).&lt;/small&gt;
Initially (100 time steps) no signal is present, LOS is asserted and the VCO runs free. 

Then the signal appears (LOS=0), and the frequency locks begins. 
::&lt;small&gt;The PD1 and PD2 gains correspond to the maximum transition density, to simplify the simulation and to shorten the acquisition for easier fitting inside the figure.&lt;/small&gt;
After about half a μsec the square waves coming from the two PDs widen clearly their periods and the filter output follows a linear ramp towards the driving voltage that brings the VCO to the lock frequency.

After a little more than 3 μsec and some phase undershoot the acquisition is complete. 

The bang-bang tracking begins, and the output phase tracks the input (that has a slight downward slope because its frequency is slightly lower than its nominal frequency). 

The error function becomes stable at about -50 rad, that correspond to the slips before lock.

Sometimes later, a little before 6 μsec have elapsed, a substantial input sinusoidal jitter appears. The filter output shows that the limits of tracking ability of the loop are slightly exceeded during every jitter cycle. But not much, as the error function does not show a strong evidence of it.

=Surveyor Hotkeys=
The KEY to operating most tools is to understand how and when {{kp| - }}, {{kp| +}}, {{kp| [ }}, {{kp| ] }} affect the active tool tip on the one hand, and when a secondary hotkey selects a class of asset on the other. The Primary hotkeys {{kp|F1, F2, ... , F7}} select the {{mb|active tool tab}}, which when pressed will toggle the tab and tool panels open or closed, as do mouseclicks as indicated.
 
A selected tool in the tool panel is often still active, so a key sequence selecting the {{mb|4th TAB-Tracks and Trackside}} such as {{kb|F4}}, then {{kp|''T''|'''M'''|F4}} will activate the ''''Trackside Tools TAB' ([F4])''', the 'T' for {{mb|'''T'''racks}} ''sub-tool menu'' and then the ''''M'''' for {{mb|Move Vertex tool}}, which will allow you to drag track vertex elements around. The last {{Kp|F4}} closes the tool panel and lets the user have more screen while adjusting Tracks. The {{mb|4th TAB-Tracks and Trackside}} mouse button can instead be used to toggle the active tool menu open and closed.

In reality, a practiced route builder will likely be toggling back and forth between several tool panels and their respective active tool sub-menus and active tools while doing fine detailing of a section of map, say where a road ({{TG|spline|spline object}} {{kp|F3|S}}) runs beside a small stream (another spline asset) both of which parallel the tracks for a time, then the stream crosses under the tracks and perhaps so does the road&amp;mdash; all running mostly together. That main scenery runs along side farmer's fields (fences being another spline, and crops often another; while farm equipment, vehicles, and animals are Objects, a different sub-menu); and down the street a few thousand meters&amp;mdash;a row of rural housing ('''O'''bjects, using {{kp|F3| '''O''' }}) which need individual placement ({{kp|LMB}} and a likely adjustment of '''H'''eight, '''R'''otation, and ''a '''M'''ove or two'' of it's position, for each and every one, (not to mention their yard elements such as trees, swings, sidewalks, driveways, hedges and so forth). Creation of even a small detailed area becomes a marathon of intense concentration and takes a practiced eye and fore-planning. 

A common enough circumstance, but integrating the Trainz assets with their respective heights, shaping the landscaping as you go means the route builder will be using a veritable flurry of hotkeys and mouse operations, perhaps switching tools as often as once every three-to-five seconds! TS12 is notorious for being responsible for slowing down that process, as the game can't keep up with the mind and hands of a practiced artist at their trade. Instead, with TS12, one often has to wait while the tool switch gets each tool to be reloaded into what seems to be the same patch of memory&amp;mdash;a sloppy programmer assumption and bad effect for the Trainz Power user.

;usage
This template forms an internal link to the [[Trainz]] wikibook with parameter &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and incorporates an option to access a sub-sub-page given the optional 3rd default parameter: &lt;code&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as well allowing for as an optional pretty-link re-title parameter &lt;code&gt;'2' allowing &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}} and/or '|3=sub-page/' &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; formatted link calls ... all forming the link and all links in the wikimarkup as:&lt;br/&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/{{{3|}}}{{{1}}}|{{{2|{{{1}}}}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/code&gt;
* Users unfamiliar with wiki-markup parameter parsing, just focus on &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}} or '|2=text' &lt;/nowiki&gt; overriding the presented text of the link, 
* and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}/  or '|3=sub-sub-linktext/' &lt;/nowiki&gt; giving a prefix to a sub-sub-page, so &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
: if and when given, &lt;u&gt;MUST HAVE&lt;/u&gt; a trailing '/' to form a proper link.
&amp;nbsp;
'''&lt;u&gt;Example-1, expanded paste down&lt;/u&gt;:'''
:This is because all template default parameters, formally 'numbered parameters' can also be specified like this:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL
 |1=Tips And Tricks
 |2=Tips
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 which wiki-markup language is processed exactly
 the same as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL |Tips And Tricks |Tips }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
;caution
When using a template such as this which forms a link, it is best to NOT use spaces between the pipe characters &quot;|&quot; as done for clarity above.
{{TrainzTip|Spaces in the 'pretty-text' part are fine!
}}
'''&lt;u&gt;In-line Examples&lt;/u&gt;:'''
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL|Tips And Tricks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; links as: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/Tips And Tricks|Tips And Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the other formulation: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Tips And Tricks|Tips And Tricks]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; both would.
:But... is much easier to edit around on a page when trying to get the best prose presentation.

* Similarly: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL|Tips And Tricks|Tricks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; links as if the constructs: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/Tips And Tricks|Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Tips And Tricks|Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is perhaps part of the phrase you want.

* Sub-subpage links will mainly be needed in the forthcoming Errorfixing series of tutorials and the Programmed Instruction (Trainz A-Z) linked progressive tutorials off their own sub-TOC base page. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:Planned use of Sub-sub-pages... '''Better than splitting the book down the multiple tracks'''... we're going to make ''a lot of new pages'' in the PI tutorials! Whether for beginners or intermediate Trainzers, they'll all end in content creation and other advanced topics like TransDEM map generation anyway.

**Systematic review of 165 reported cases of primary aortic sarcomas
***Median age 60, male to female ratio 1.5 to 1.
***Median overall survival 11 months; 1-, 3-, 5-year rates of 47%, 17%, and 9%.
***High grade sarcomas (87%), arterial embolization (47%), and metastatic disease at diagnosis (45%) common 
***Most common sites of embolization were abdomen (23%) and extremities (21%). 
***Most common sites of metastases were bone (29%) and lung (16%)
***Reported histologies included undifferentiated (39%), angiosarcomatous (37%), leiomyosarcomatous (13%), and fibroblastic (7.3%) sarcomas
***Univariate OS analysis: absence of metastases at diagnosis (p&lt;.001), management with surgical resection (P&lt;.001), and chemotherapy (p=.02) beneficial. Multivariate: only metastatic disease (P&lt;.001) remained significant
**Conclusion: Poor prognosis overall. Long term survivors have been reported with aggressive management involving resection + adjuvant therapy. High embolic rates suggest a potential role for prophylactic anticoagulation</text>

=Trainz Advanced Content Creation=
&lt;!--- unless you know template coding, it would be best to leave this section unedited. It's an expanded double substitution of the template {{underconstruction}} altered to specify this page vice the book, which is undergoing revisions, including new construction. Bottom line, that template has the wrong message....

==Purpose==
[[File:Amoskeag' locomotive, No. 92, Amoskeag Manufacturing Company.jpg|thumb|right|The Trainz Content Creator may have little more than a picture like this to work with for developing Trainz models of older asset prototypes. Most locomotives take upwards of 6 months of diligent effort to make a good model, so send your favorite Content Creators chocolates or flowers today!]]
This Book Division index page is a master '''&lt;u&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/u&gt;''' page for Intermediate Skills and Advanced 3D Content Modeling and skills building topics. Just as Introductory Trainz pages linked above is for those just getting their feet onto the first slopes of the various Trainz learning curves, and Content Creation and References are for even more advance topics. If the reader visualizes a large reference work in a three ring binder with TABS sticking out to quickly switch between book sections, you see what we're trying to accomplish in your minds eye.
 
At the file structure level, some threaded materials will be linked both in-sequence (threaded page to page 1st to next page) and in collections of related material where it was relocated into various places such as '''[[Trainz/Appendices|Trainz Wikibook Appendix pages]]''', or other divisions of the Trainz Wikibooks. Consequenly, if you've seen such a page, with a slightly different look the chances are you have&amp;mdash;the magic of modern type setting technology in a Wiki allows that page to appear both ways! These Division TOC pages will also introduce new and older Trainzers to that of organization of the work, and give a greater sense of where to look for things when needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Prologue to History ==
There was no time. The was no space. There was simply nothing. The universe was but a state of immense heat and energy, and incredible density. Such a scale of energy and heat that was so compact was the precursor to all history, and by means still not exactly known, the dense state of heat and energy suddenly and rapidly expanded, travailing at a speed barely comprehensible. The Big Bang. Just a mere second after the universe came into existence it was at a temperature of 5.5 billion Celsius (10 billion Fahrenheit). This cosmic plasma soup contained a vast array of fundamental particles such as neutrons, electrons and protons, which as the universe gradually cooled died off. 13.798 ± 0.037 billion BCE. The start of history. Over the next billions of years the universe continued to cool off and expand, even to this day, it is still expanding from the force of the Big Bang. Eventually hydrogen, helium and lithium, created from particles formed by the Big Bang, started to come together to form heaver elements, which would in turn form stars.


Why does this matter? Why is Astronomy history being discussed in a world history wikibook? Because humanity itself is made from the big bang. Carbon-based lifeforms are made up of elements first conceived in the Big Bang. The particles of the early universe are what form our bodies. We are made of star stuff. Further more, the advancement of humanity is also possible only through the formation of the universe. The natural metal and ore deposits on Earth shaped history, as everything from weapons and armor to plows and eating utensils would not be possible if the right elements had not formed in the Big Bang. While obviously in the broad sense the Big Bang created history by creating time itself, the Big Bang contributed all of the necessary conditions and elements for human civilization to arise. People in the past were often fascinated by space and the stars, and rightfully so. Everything we know today came from the stars. Even you, the reader, has portions of the universe from the Big Bang flowing through your veins, beating in your chest. In order to understand and appreciate the proceeding guide through history, it is important to know that all of it was due to a cosmic coincidence that remnants of still can be seen today. Perhaps the amazement with the cosmos is symbiotic, as we continue to study the force that brought us into creation, that force also ever studies us, watching us grow and evolve as our society and civilizations advance. And in that cosmic sense, that is the essence of history

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Constraints ===
:[[../Create_Table#Table_Constraint|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- Denominate all contraints with an expressive name, eg.: abbreviations for
-- table name (unique across all tables in your schema), column name, constraint type, running number.
--
CREATE TABLE myExampleTable (
  id               DECIMAL,
  col_1            DECIMAL(1),   -- only 1 (signed) digit
  col_2            VARCHAR(50),

  CONSTRAINT example_check_2      CHECK (LENGTH(col_2) &lt; LENGTH(col_3))
);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Foreign Key ===
:[[../Foreign_Key|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- Reference to a different (or the same) table. This creates 1:m or n:m relationships.
CREATE TABLE t_hierarchie (
  id               DECIMAL,
  part_name        VARCHAR(50),
  super_part_id    DECIMAL,      -- ID of the part which contains this part
  CONSTRAINT hier_pk             PRIMARY KEY (id),
  -- In this special case the foreign key refers to the same table
  CONSTRAINT hier_fk             FOREIGN KEY (super_part_id) REFERENCES t_hierarchie(id)
);

-- -----------------------------------------------
--             n:m relationships
-- -----------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE t1 (
  id               DECIMAL,
  name             VARCHAR(50),
  -- ...
  CONSTRAINT t1_pk               PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
CREATE TABLE t2 (
  id               DECIMAL,
  name             VARCHAR(50),
  -- ...
  CONSTRAINT t2_pk               PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
CREATE TABLE t1_t2 (
  id               DECIMAL,
  t1_id            DECIMAL,
  t2_id            DECIMAL,
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_pk            PRIMARY KEY (id),       -- also this table should have its own Primary Key
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_unique        UNIQUE (t1_id, t2_id),  -- every link should occur only once
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_fk_1          FOREIGN KEY (t1_id) REFERENCES t1(id),
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_fk_2          FOREIGN KEY (t2_id) REFERENCES t2(id)
);

-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--      ON DELETE / ON UPDATE / DEFFERABLE
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -- DELETE and UPDATE behaviour for child tables (see first example)
  -- Oracle: Only DELETE [CASCADE | SET NULL] is possible. Default is NO ACTION, but this cannot be
  --         specified explicit - just omit the phrase.
  CONSTRAINT hier_fk             FOREIGN KEY (super_part_id) REFERENCES t_hierarchie(id)
                                 ON DELETE CASCADE  -- or: NO ACTION (the default), RESTRICT, SET NULL, SET DEFAULT
                                 ON UPDATE CASCADE  -- or: NO ACTION (the default), RESTRICT, SET NULL, SET DEFAULT

  -- Initial stage: immediate vs. deferred, [not] deferrable
  -- MySQL: DEFERABLE is not supported
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_fk_1          FOREIGN KEY (t1_id) REFERENCES t1(id)
                                 INITIALLY IMMEDIATE DEFERRABLE

-- Change constraint characteristics at a later stage
SET CONSTRAINT hier_fk DEFERRED; -- or: IMMEDIATE

&lt;/source&gt;

== Alter Table ==

:[[../Alter_Table|More Details]]

Concerning columns.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Add a column (plus some column constraints). Oracle: The key word 'COLUMN' is not allowed.
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN col_1 VARCHAR(100) CHECK (LENGTH(col_1) &gt; 5);

-- Change a columns characteristic. (Some implementations use different key words like 'MODIFY'.)
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER COLUMN col_1 SET DATA TYPE NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER COLUMN col_1 SET SET DEFAULT -1;
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER COLUMN col_1 SET  NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER COLUMN col_1 DROP NOT NULL;

-- Drop a column. Oracle: The key word 'COLUMN' is mandatory.
ALTER TABLE t1 DROP COLUMN col_2;
&lt;/source&gt;

Concerning complete table.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- 
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD   CONSTRAINT t1_col_1_uniq UNIQUE (col_1);
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD   CONSTRAINT t1_col_2_fk FOREIGN KEY (col_2) REFERENCES person (id);

-- Change definitons. Some implementations use different key words like 'MODIFY'.
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER CONSTRAINT t1_col_1_unique UNIQUE (col_1);

-- Drop a constraint. You need to know its name. Not supported by MySQL, there is only a 'DROP FOREIGN KEY'.
ALTER TABLE t1 DROP  CONSTRAINT t1_col_1_unique;
-- As an extention to the SQL standard some implementations offer an ENABLE / DISABLE command for constraints.

&lt;/source&gt;

== Drop Table ==
:[[../Drop_Table|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- All data and complete table structure inclusive indices are thrown away.
-- No column name. No WHERE clause. No trigger is fired. Considers Foreign Keys. Very fast.
DROP TABLE t1;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Select ==
=== Basic Syntax ===
:[[../SELECT:_Fundamentals|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- Overall structure: SELECT / FROM / WHERE / GROUP BY / HAVING / ORDER BY

--     constants, column values, operators,     functions 
SELECT 'ID: ',    id,            col_1 + col_2, sqrt(col_2)
FROM   t1
-- precedence within WHERE: functions, comparisions, NOT, AND, OR
WHERE  col_1 &gt; 100
AND    NOT MOD(col_2, 10) = 0
OR     col_3 &lt; col_1
ORDER BY col_4 DESC, col_5  -- sort ascending (the default) or descending
;

-- number of rows, number of not-null-values
SELECT COUNT(*),   COUNT(col_1) FROM t1;

-- predefined functions
SELECT COUNT(col_1), MAX(col_1), MIN(col_1), AVG(col_1), SUM(col_1) FROM t1;

-- UNIQUE values only
SELECT DISTINCT col_1 FROM t1;

-- In the next example col_1 many have duplicates. Only the combination of col_1 plus col_2 is unique. 
SELECT DISTINCT col_1, col_2 FROM t1;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Case ===
:[[../SELECT:_Case_Expression|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- CASE expression with conditions on exactly ONE column
SELECT id,
       CASE contact_type   -- ONE column name
         WHEN 'fixed line' THEN 'Phone'
         WHEN 'mobile'     THEN 'Phone'
         ELSE                   'Not a telephone number'
       END,
       contact_value
FROM   contact;

-- CASE expression with conditions on ANY column
SELECT id,
       CASE   -- NO column name
         WHEN contact_type IN ('fixed line', 'mobile')  THEN 'Phone'
         WHEN id = 4                                    THEN 'ICQ'
         ELSE                                                'Something else'
       END,
       contact_value
FROM   contact;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Grouping ===
:[[../SELECT:_Grouping|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
SELECT product_group, count(*) AS cnt
FROM   sales
WHERE  region = 'west'   -- additional restrictions are possible but not necessary
GROUP BY product_group   -- 'product_group' is the criterion which creates groups
HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1000   -- restriction to groups with more than 1000 sales per group
ORDER BY cnt;

-- Attention: in the next example col_2 is not part of the GROUP BY criterion. Therefore it cannot be displayed.
SELECT col_1, col_2
FROM   t1
GROUP BY col_1;

-- We must accumulate all col_2-values of each group to ONE value, eg:
SELECT col_1, sum(col_2), min(col_2)
FROM   t1
GROUP BY col_1;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Join ===
:[[../SELECT:_Join_Operation|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- Inner join: Only persons together with their contacts.
--             Ignores all persons without contacts and all contacts without persons
SELECT *
FROM   person p
JOIN   contact c ON p.id = c.person_id;

-- Left outer join: ALL persons. Ignores contacts without persons
SELECT *
FROM      person p
LEFT JOIN contact c ON p.id = c.person_id;

-- Right outer join: ALL contacts. Ignores persons without contacts
SELECT *
FROM       person p
RIGHT JOIN contact c ON p.id = c.person_id;

-- Full outer join: ALL persons. ALL contacts.
SELECT *
FROM      person p
FULL JOIN contact c ON p.id = c.person_id;

-- Carthesian product (missing ON keyword): be carefull!
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM   person p
JOIN   contact c;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Subquery ===
:[[../SELECT:_Subquery|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- Subquery within SELECT clause
SELECT id,
       lastname,
       weight,
       (SELECT avg(weight) FROM person)    -- the subquery
FROM   person;

-- Subquery within WHERE clause
SELECT id,
       lastname,
       weight
FROM   person
WHERE  weight &lt; (SELECT avg(weight) FROM person)    -- the subquery
;

-- CORRELATED subquery within SELECT clause
SELECT id,
       (SELECT status_name FROM status st WHERE st.id = sa.state)
FROM   sales sa;

-- CORRELATED subquery retrieving the highest version within each booking_number
SELECT *
FROM   booking b
WHERE  version =
  (SELECT MAX(version) FROM booking sq WHERE sq.booking_number = b.booking_number)
;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Set operations ===
:[[../SELECT:_Set_Operations|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- UNION
SELECT firstname  -- first SELECT command
FROM   person
  UNION           -- push both intermediate results together to one result
SELECT lastname   -- second SELECT command
FROM   person;

-- Default behaviour is: 'UNION DISTINCT'. 'UNION ALL' must be explicitly specified, if duplicate values shall be removed.

-- INTERSECT: resulting values must be in BOTH intermediate results
SELECT firstname FROM person
  INTERSECT
SELECT lastname  FROM person;

-- EXCEPT: resulting values must be in the first but not in the second intermediate result
SELECT firstname FROM person
  EXCEPT   -- Oracle uses 'MINUS'. MySQL does not support EXCEPT.
SELECT lastname  FROM person;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Recursions ===
:[[../Recursions|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- The 'with clause' consists of three parts:
-- First: arbitrary name of an intermediate table and its columns
WITH intermediate_table (id, firstname, lastname) AS
(
  -- Second: starting row (or rows)
  SELECT id, firstname, lastname
  FROM   family_tree
  WHERE  firstname = 'Karl'
  AND    lastname  = 'Miller'
    UNION ALL
  -- Third: Definition of the rule for querying the next level. In most cases this is done with a join operation.
  SELECT f.id, f.firstname, f.lastname 
  FROM   intermediate_table i
  JOIN   family_tree f ON f.father_id = i.id
)

-- After the 'with clause': depth first / breadth first
-- SEARCH BREADTH FIRST BY firstname SET sequence_number (default behaviour)
-- SEARCH DEPTH FIRST BY firstname SET sequence_number

-- The final SELECT
SELECT * FROM intermediate_table;

-- Hints: Oracle supports the syntax of the SQL standard since version 11.2. .
--        MySQL does not support recursions at all and recommend procedural workarounds.
&lt;/source&gt;

== Insert ==
:[[../INSERT_2|More Details]]

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;

The diagram someone has attempted to include has just come up as a file name in a box! I assume that is not what you wanted! Just thought i'd let you know. I tried taking a screen shot to show you but it turns out that putting an image in is not as straight forward as it seems because it doesn't let you choose from your own files. I will ask about it in the reading room.

==on it==
Hey Raf, the lack of referencing is my fault and i will fix it now.[[User:AlexandraChanner|AlexandraChanner]] ([[User talk:AlexandraChanner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AlexandraChanner|contribs]]) 14:00, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

[[User:JamesBeresford-Smith|JamesBeresford-Smith]] you said that you were having some problems with uploading photos. I suggest saving the file to your computer so that you can upload it using the 'embedded file' button that is located just above the type box. If this doesn't work please let one of us know before 5 so that we can help you find a solution. Alternatively, try asking in the reading room but you don't have too long to get a response![[User:AlexandraChanner|AlexandraChanner]] ([[User talk:AlexandraChanner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AlexandraChanner|contribs]]) 14:00, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Kylie- i did the first paragraph of Future of Crowdsourcing but i have no idea who did the other half- anyone? its not a direct quote but it does need to be referenced, something which i shall be sorting out now.[[User:AlexandraChanner|AlexandraChanner]] ([[User talk:AlexandraChanner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AlexandraChanner|contribs]]) 14:00, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

==Proofreading==
I spent a couple hours last night proofreading and made a few alterations this morning, please let me know if you don't agree with any of them. 

There are still a few things that need work, so from what I can see, can the authors of the things below change or shout at me for misunderstanding what you've written:
* Still no references in &quot;History of Crowdsourcing&quot;.
* 'Internet Gaming' need clarification on what Greenlight actually is (is it a website?).
* Rheingold references in the text should be referenced like other references with footnotes instead of in-text parenthesis.
* Is the Ghana example under 'Endorsement' part of (Rheingold) too? No reference. 
* I don't understand what Lush is doing that's crowdsourcing &quot;More people know about the companies than the charities&quot;- unsure what companies you mean.
* 'Future of Crowdsourcing' section:  'reports showed', 'Mark Prensky coined the term' and 'belief amongst academics' all need references.
* I don't fully understand the last few sentences of 'Future of Crowdsourcing' - starting with the challenges companies could face. The sentence structure was a little confusing too, I changed some already. 
* Reference 18 is a quote therefore needs a page number.
* References 13/19/ 20 are not MLA. I would do every citation in text with a separate footnote.
References are the most important, Wikipedians can delete sections at any time if we don't provide any evidence to support what we have written. 
Now be angry at me. Thanks!

Hey, [[User:JamesBeresford-Smith|JamesBeresford-Smith]] any luck on adding multimedia to the page as discussed in our meeting?

''From main book page:''
Whoever did the &quot;Future of Crowdsourcing&quot; section - is that a direct quote from an article somewhere? If so, please reference it!! Thank you [[User:Rkmraf|Rkmraf]] for fixing the referencing problem we were having, would you please tell me what you did? And is it an automatic format that it goes into? I wanted to fix the references that were just websites to the full citation, but it just takes me back to having the footnote &quot;1&quot;. Thanks! And also, we have only a couple more days so if [[User:JamesBeresford-Smith|JamesBeresford-Smith]]  and  [[User:JamieS TA|JamieS TA]] could let us know their sections, that'd be awesome.

::So, Wiki has some code that as far as I understand will automatically copy and sort the references chronologically, to activate it you have to type 'reflist' and some punctuation where you want it to appear. All it does is copy what we've written ourselves so you still have to write out the reference (or paste from RefWorks/EasyBib to make sure it's correct). So after the end of the text you're referencing paste the MLA reference in between a &lt; ref &gt; *&lt;u&gt;your reference&lt;/u&gt;* &lt; / ref &gt;. Once saved it will appear under the references heading. I've formatted &quot;2&quot; to MLA so try &quot;8&quot;. I also think the &quot;The key ingredients of crowdsourcing according to a few dozen scholars who have published on the topic&quot; needs a reference. If we say a few dozen, we ought to at least give one of them, could you add one in please [[User:AlexandraChanner|AlexandraChanner]]?.

Yeaaah! sorting out all these references just still a bit confused by the process. I dont the book that i read it in gave any specific examples but i will try to take a look.

Hello everyone! I just discovered that The Guardian website has a section with all of their articles relating to crowdsourcing, should be helpful for anyone who hasn't done any work yet or needs something to write about. [http://www.theguardian.com/technology/crowdsourcing Here!] Hope that helps. [[User:CiaranBC|CiaranBC]] ([[User talk:CiaranBC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/CiaranBC|contribs]]) 13:26, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys! I noticed that the References section has been deleted, so I am going to put that back in there. In addition, I am going to add a &quot;Contributors&quot; section so we can all just sign our names at the end, instead of having them on each piece (as Greg suggested). If you could just tell me the format we are using for the References, that'd be great and just pop them in there when you've got them. *SIDENOTE* Please make sure to go in order of the footnote numbers! Cheers [[User:KylieMott|KylieMott]] ([[User talk:KylieMott|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KylieMott|contribs]]) 19:11, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

=== HOW TO PUT IN A REFERENCE=== 
Using the toolbar at the top of the typing box page, there's a little icon that looks like a open book. Just copy/paste the link that you used, or a full reference if it wasnt taken from online into the blank area after clicking the book, and then &quot;okay&quot;. It will come up as a whole huge mess, but if you preview/save page, you will see that it turns into a little number instead. 
&lt;s&gt;JUST KNOW THAT you still will have to do this reference again in the REFERENCES section at the bottom of the wikibook. It does not automatically fill that in.&lt;/s&gt; 
[[User:KylieMott|KylieMott]] ([[User talk:KylieMott|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KylieMott|contribs]]) 12:59, 30 March 2014 (UTC)
::When I first tried that (I was highlighting the referenced text/ saving) the referenced text would disappear! I've started doing it manually with the ref tag. I think the number should automatically take you to the correct reference so not sure what I'm linking them to just now. I keep doing that then will try to change them all at the end and hopefully fix them.

ALRIGHT y'all, I started on the INTRODUCTION section of the Wiki, just to get something down. If you don't like it, please change it, but I wanted a basis put up so it would be easier to get a grasp on what we are working with. Cheers!

SIDENOTE: (I think this is a good place to start, given that there have been no lectures yet on crowdsourcing. This is just a definition I pulled offline and at least it could get us all acquainted with the term. I will let y'all know any new info I get. Cheers!) [[User:KylieMott|KylieMott]] ([[User talk:KylieMott|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KylieMott|contribs]]) 10:06, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

Should we make a mention that what a Wikibook -IS- is crowdsourcing? I think it is quite relevant and would be a good real-life example of what it is rather than a simple definition (Putting this here because everyone should get a notification, and it'd be information to consider for each part of the page.

Oh my gosh, I really need to figure out how to use this haha. Im not great. But I thought this may be helpful, it's about how CROWDSOURCING is being used to help locate the Malaysian Flight 370 that disappeared recently: http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/03/crowdsourcing-the-search-for-malaysia-flight-370/ 
We may be able to use this in the RESOURCES section, or something, just as a reference on how it is used today, again making it seem applicable. [[User:KylieMott|KylieMott]] ([[User talk:KylieMott|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KylieMott|contribs]]) 14:41, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

::Oh, Kylie. I thought I was so special when found out about crowdsourcing being used to search for the plane! Apparently other people read the news too but it's great to know we're on the same page! I see you've done a great job on the introduction and Main Concepts bit also. I'll do a more in depth write-up about Flight 370, might do a historical examples section. I know [[User:JamesBeresford-Smith|JamesBeresford-Smith]] had some examples of his own too. Under The Problems With Crowdsourcing I feel like we should add another specific example- how about the search for the Boston Marathon Bombing suspects using Reddit? I can tackle this unless you were already doing it yourself. Let me know. I've noticed Snowden is the only group doing Crowdsourcing so we don't have to worry about stepping on each other's toes after all.

The plane was a great idea! As soon as i found out that we had crowd sourcing i thought of it as i had read about it on the bus that day! :) More examples is a good idea.. what do you guys think.. do you think that those question forums (such as yahoo answers) are an example of crowd sourcing?  i suppose they could be..

'''Also''', guys remember we do not have to sign the sections we have written with the tildes. It makes the Wikibook look messy. So I say delete the signatures from every paragraph.

I found a book on the future of crowdsourcing by Jeff Howe (some of you might have come across this already, and I notice this has already been a section on this put into the Wikibook) but there's some interesting ideas in there about the ways in which children and teenagers use digital media and how it could cause some things which are scarce to become abundant and it could cause issues for businesses which trade in those things (it uses gaming as an example so it links in nicely to the section on gaming, as well as having some links to other ideas such as collaboration). Do you guys think exploring these ideas could be something useful to add into the book? [[User:JamieS TA|JamieS TA]] ([[User talk:JamieS TA|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamieS TA|contribs]]) 16:01, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

:: Yeah his basic argument is about how crowdsourcing will shape the future of business so I think I'll go ahead and write some stuff about that, where do you think is best in the book for this to go?

Ok so I put what I had under 'The future of crowdsourcing' section; I hope it's alright! I think I referenced correctly but I'm not sure.

&lt;u&gt;'''Referencing update'''
&lt;/u&gt;
Good news! I found a way for the references to automatically appear in the reference list! I simply went onto another WIki article and had a look at the code! From now on just reference in the text itself, the references will automatically appear at the bottom with the working numbered links.  If we accumulate a lot of them, we can change it so that appear in two columns. 
Remember that for consistency reasons we are using MLA 7th edition. [[User:Rkmraf|Rkmraf]] ([[User talk:Rkmraf|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rkmraf|contribs]]) 19:41, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi guys. Part of what I've discovered whilst doing my bit for &quot;Always On&quot; might be useful for your page regarding crowdsourcing and crowdfunding. I was going to post it straight on to your book as a contribution but thought I'd check in with you first. Here is the piece - I can give you the references or just put it straight on the book - just let me know. Cheers. 
&quot;Crowdfunding, which a part of crowdsourcing, can lead to a company becoming so attractive after start-up that the owners are tempted to sell to make a large financial gain, potentially upsetting early backers. This was the case recently when Facebook bought virtual reality technology firm Oculus VR for £1.2bn, a company that was started with crowdfunding.  After Oculus VR sold to Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg claimed that “virtual reality will be the next social communications platform” (The Guardian, 25th March, 2014). Reaction was the early backers were mixed with some against and some in favour (BBC, 26th March, 2014). Crowdfunding and crowdsourcing can clearly set in motion ideas and products that can become part of a global means of communication, as evidenced by the acquisition of such a product by Facebook, one of the world’s largest technology companies.&quot;[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 15:07, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Just noticed I probably put the above suggested contribution in a place in your discussion page that no one will see unless they are looking to check on referencing - so I'll post it now as the deadline is drawing near- I've edited it to fit in with what is already there under Crowdfunding - so if anyone wants to edit it further over the next 36 hours please feel free ... hope I don't mess up the referencing - will try not to![[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 09:34, 3 April 2014 (UTC)
::Thanks for the contribution, George!  Of course we appreciate any additions to the chapter as it's a collaborative and crowdsourced activity. I was somewhat confused that Facebook, out of all companies, bought Oculus VR with the Oculus Rift gaming VR system being so close to a consumer release. It could have been a response to Sony [http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/sony-unveils-project-morpheus-a-virtual-reality-rival-to-the-oculus-rift-9201428.html announcing]  their own plans in the market but these acquisitions are usually in talks for a long time. Acquisitions such as these probably raise questions of trust from backers and the ethicality of 'selling out'. Backers of these projects simply invest/ support the projects but often may not get any real value from doing so- except the satisfaction of helping a startup and the promise of an eventual product. In the case of Oculus VR, many backers are left with [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game/posts thank you notes, T-shirts and posters] even though without their initial support the project would likely not have existed at all. Are the backers left high and dry while the Oculus team are left with a company valued at $2 billion? You've got me thinking, I may add these thoughts as another criticism to crowdfunding, issues of ownership certainly come into play.

== Multimedia ==

Hi guys. I still have little idea how to get multimedia onto the Crowdsourcing page. When I try to use something from Wikimedia it denies the upload because its their content? So what's the point of having Wikimedia if we can't use it? Any ideas?

==''What is Growth Hacking?''==

Growth hacking is a method of rapidly and inexpensively growing a company’s user base, sales, or market share. &lt;ref&gt;http://blog.ourcrowd.com/index.php/2014/01/21/what-is-a-growth-hacker-and-why-every-startup-needs-one/&lt;/ref&gt; Coined by Sean Ellis in 2010, this low-cost strategy often employs technological solutions such as search engine optimization, website analytics, [http://www.creativeguerrillamarketing.com/what-is-guerrilla-marketing/ guerrilla marketing], optimizing user experience and user interface, and leveraging social media platforms to enhance user experience &lt;ref name= &quot;quicksprout&quot;&gt; [http://www.quicksprout.com/the-definitive-guide-to-growth-hacking-chapter-1/] &lt;/ref&gt;. Since being coined in 2010, the term and its associated marketing strategies have become popular in the tech industry and have begun to branch out into other sectors, leading to the first [http://growthhackersconference.com/ Growth Hackers Conference] in 2013.

==''Profile of a Growth Hacker''==

''“Many of the growth hacking descriptions on the web are unnecessarily restrictive. I don’t believe growth hackers must be formal engineers when many of the most well-regarded growth hackers don’t code regularly.&lt;ref name = quicksprout&quot;&gt;[http://www.quicksprout.com/the-definitive-guide-to-growth-hacking-chapter-2/] &lt;/ref&gt;” 
 -Gagan Biyani, Co-Founder of Udemy, Growth Hacker ''

A typical growth hacker is tech-savvy, highly analytical, and data-driven &lt;ref name=&quot;whenGHgoesbad&quot;&gt; [http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/03/when-growth-hacking-goes-bad//] &lt;/ref&gt;. Although many growth hackers are programmers, growth hackers can come from a variety of backgrounds. Though many growth hacking strategies are technical in nature, they often also require outside-of-the-box thinking, creativity, and comfort dealing with qualitative data and ambiguity &lt;ref name=&quot;whenGHgoesbad&quot;&gt; [http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/03/when-growth-hacking-goes-bad//] &lt;/ref&gt;. According to Aaron Ginn via [http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/21/defining-a-growth-hacker-building-growth-into-your-team/ TechCrunch], a strong growth hacking team typically consists of a programmer, analyst, and a marketer who combine their skills to achieve rapid growth. The web developer manipulates and designs marketing platforms, the analyst analyzes data to expose trends and motivate strategies, and the marketer pitches growth recommendations to clients.

='''Growth Hacking and Professional Ethics'''=
==''Growth Hacking Practices: Where to Draw the Line''==

The term [http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/hacker hacking] is often perceived negatively because of its use to describe individuals who illicitly exploit security flaws in computer systems. When used in the context of growth hacking, however, hacking signifies developing creative, efficient, and often novel solutions to problems, in this case user growth. [http://www.growtheverywhere.com/sean-ellis/ Eric Ellis], coiner of the term &quot;growth hacking&quot;, emphasizes that &quot;people don’t get caught up on the term “growth hacker” or even a specific definition for it&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;EllisQuote&quot;&gt; [http://blog.clarity.fm/what-300-years-of-growth-hacking-can-teach-us/] &lt;/ref&gt; , but rather &quot;focus instead on the concepts behind it.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;EllisQuote&quot;&gt; [http://blog.clarity.fm/what-300-years-of-growth-hacking-can-teach-us/] &lt;/ref&gt; According to Ellis, growth hackers utilize data to find a marketing highway for growth. Though the most critical goal of growth hacking is growth, some companies employ tactics that border on exploitation of current and prospective users. However, companies who utilize more exploitive or invasive growth tactics often experience backlash and criticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;ourcrowdblog&quot;&gt; [http://blog.ourcrowd.com/index.php/2014/01/21/what-is-a-growth-hacker-and-why-every-startup-needs-one/] &lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes these poor growth practices can be attributed to individual growth hackers who focus too closely on their bottom line and disregard to the best interests of the company reputation and customer well-being. Some such [http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/unethical unethical]and unprofessional tactics used by these growth hackers include, but are not limited too, taking aggressive action to obtain email addresses and personal information of a target population, [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Internet_Technologies/Email_spam spamming], inappropriately slandering competitor products, false advertising,and secretly tracking customer internet habits. &lt;ref name=&quot;whenGHgoesbad&quot;&gt; [http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/03/when-growth-hacking-goes-bad//] &lt;/ref&gt; While their tactics may result in temporary praise and apparent growth, sabotaging reputations and customer trust does not benefit the company in the long run. Furthermore, these &quot;bad apples&quot; sour the image of growth hacking as a whole and how it can help companies experience incredible growth and success.&lt;ref name=&quot;ourcrowdblog&quot;&gt; [http://blog.ourcrowd.com/index.php/2014/01/21/what-is-a-growth-hacker-and-why-every-startup-needs-one/] &lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the best growth hackers have an ability to implement effective growth strategies and methods while keeping the users' perspectives in mind. In doing so, these growth hackers bring success to their organizations, maintain a good user experience, and uphold the integrity of the profession.

Today, unethical and unprofessional growth hacking techniques are often used on social media platforms. &lt;ref name=&quot;whenGHgoesbad&quot;&gt; [http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/03/when-growth-hacking-goes-bad//] &lt;/ref&gt; For example, spamming techniques are common on applications like [http://www.gotinder.com/ Tinder], a dating application, and [http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2013/04/04/glide-brings-instant-video-messaging-to-mobile/ Glide], a video application. These applications allow users or admins to send non-users messages with links to download. Because many of these messages are unsolicited and sent purely to attract people to the site, they border on unethical. These messages cross the line, however, when they trick users who think they are navigating to an advertised site by sending them another site altogether. &lt;ref name=&quot;whenGHgoesbad&quot;&gt; [http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/03/when-growth-hacking-goes-bad//] &lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, there are also successful ethical growth hacking techniques. The most widely-used ethical technique in growth hacking is clever use of data and analytics to optimize a companies site, products, and services to best serve people not currently a part of the company's user base. In the cases of Tinder and Glide, data analytics could have been utilized to pinpoint trends in the target populations instead of inundating users with spam. Growth hacking techniques should thus optimally behave like an attractive side of a magnet: the techniques should entice current and prospective users to click, download, and make purchases on their own terms without being hassled.

==''Normalization of Deviance''==
One aspect of professional ethics that pertains to growth hacking is [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professionalism/Diane_Vaughan_and_the_normalization_of_deviance Diane Vaughan's] theory of normalization of deviance. Specifically, growth hacking techniques used by companies can fall prey to a gradual slip in ethical standards, especially with user data and information. Companies like Facebook and Google constantly monitor their users' behavior and habits in order to best serve them with ads and provide an optimal user experience. In doing so, however, these companies have occasionally crossed the line in the degree to which they extract user data and personal information. With [https://www.facebook.com/about/graphsearch Graph Search], for instance, Facebook believed they had improved searching for items (people, photos, events, etc) on the website, but in doing so exposed to the public lots of user information that had formerly been private or hidden. Like the theory states, there was a swift negative public response, and Facebook released improvements that offered users more control over access to their content and information. Still, these companies extract and use incredible amounts of data in ways currently not known by the public. With a rise of users and user activity on theses sites and concurrent rise in the amount of data these sites process, more information about how these sites use the data will likely surface. Hopefully they use the data ethically; if not we will likely see another backlash and correction before yet another normalization of deviant data use.

='''Case Studies'''=

==''Leveraging''==
One of the most cited examples of growth hacking was [https://www.airbnb.com/ AirBNB's] leveraging of Craigslist to rapidly expand its user base. In the two years following AirBNB's 2008 launch, AirBNB's marketing team employed several growth strategies aimed at tapping into Craigslist's then much larger user base. First, AirBNB engineers reverse engineered Craigslist's posting mechanism. In doing so, AirBNB was able to offer its users an option to post a new AirBNB listing directly to Craigslist in the form of a Craigslist post that would then link back to AirBNB. This tactic both enabled early AirBNB users to advertise their listings to a much wider audience and brought many Craigslist users to the AirBNB platform. Though not an illicit tactic per se, Craigslist eventually resolved the vulnerability that enabled external sites to create listings, thus bringing an end to that functionality for AirBNB users&lt;ref name=&quot;The Definiteive Guide to Growth Hacking&quot;&gt; [http://www.quicksprout.com/the-definitive-guide-to-growth-hacking-chapter-1/]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The second tactic employed by AirBNB was to send messages recommending AirBNB to Craigslist users who posted rental listings similar to those found on AirBNB. This tactic, considered by some as [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Internet_Technologies/Email_spam spamming], was detailed most notably by web developer Dave Gooden, who works in the vacation rental industry and was curious about the source of AirBNB's rapid growth &lt;ref name=&quot;How AirBNB Became a Billion Dollar Company&quot; &gt;[http://davegooden.com/2011/05/how-airbnb-became-a-billion-dollar-company/]&lt;/ref&gt;. In his 2011 blog post &quot;How AirBNB Became a Billion Dollar Company&quot;, Gooden revealed his investigation into AirBNB's growth tactics. After posting a rental listing on Craigslist, he received an email from a random Gmail account recommending AirBNB. He then created his own rental site and listed one of the rental properties from that site on Craigslist, only to receive a similar email recommending he list his rental on AirBNB. So many Craigslist users likely received similar messages from AirBNB after posting rental properties and wound up listing their rentals on AirBNB as well.

Though neither of these tactics were illegal, they both called into question the ethics of growth hacking. On one hand, AirBNB took advantage of another website's existing user base and sent spam. On the other, AirBNB turned into a respectable service that now allows people to rent places to stay in 34,000 cities in 192 countries &lt;ref name=&quot;AirBNB&quot;&gt;[https://www.airbnb.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;. Indeed, AirBNB illustrates the importance of attracting users to nascent startups. For many startups, efforts on quality control and expansion come only after some degree of trust in their business models is established, and nothing speaks more to an internet company's success than user base.

==''Incentivization''==
Many companies achieve growth by offering incentives to users who refer their friends to the company. [https://www.dropbox.com/help/15/en Dropbox], for one, gives a user 2 gigabytes of cloud storage space immediately when they sign up. They then offer their users the ability to send referral links to their friends with the promise of 500 additional megabytes of storage space per successful referral free users and 1 gigabyte per referral  (Dropbox caps their referral award space at 16 gigabytes for free users and 32 gigabytes for paid users). &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dropbox.com/help/54/en]&lt;/ref&gt;. And referring a friend is not the only way to receive free space--giving feedback on the site, connecting social media accounts, using Dropbox as a primary photo storage, and linking an iOS mail account will all give users more free space &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dropbox.com/help/15/en]&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, Dropbox has created incentives to help bring more users in and also to incentivize current users to invest in the Dropbox ecosystem.

Similarly, Venmo, mobile application that lets users send each other electronically, gifts successful referrals with a $5 addition to their account &lt;ref&gt;[https://venmo.com/info/product]&lt;/ref&gt;. Here Venmo has created an incentive that aligns perfectly with the app's functionality--users link their credit cards and bank accounts to their Venmo account, so the addition of $5 to that account provides users a visible incentive to send the app to their friends.

Other companies who participate in referral bonuses are [http://rewards.na.leagueoflegends.com/ League of Legends], [http://www.marriott.com/marriott-rewards/refer-a-friend.mi Marriot hotels], [http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/support/referral-rewards Verizon wireless], [https://www316.americanexpress.com/iFormsSecure/un/UK/Refer-A-Friend/iforms.do?cuid=emgmUpliftMGMER_en_GB&amp;evtsrc=link&amp;evttype=0&amp;mgmerSource=mgmerHub American Express], [http://www.orbitz.com/rewards/refer-a-friend/ Orbitz], [https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral Groupon], [http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/referral/referralProgram.jsp DirectTV], and many others.

='''Conclusion'''=
Because growth hacking is a relatively new concept and many of the key growth hacking strategies are still evolving, the ethics of growth hacking will continue to shift. In science and engineering fields, mistakes and poor decisions can potentially lead to loss of life or massive damage to property and the environment. Examples of such mistakes and poor decisions are illustrated by cases such as the [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professionalism/Therac-25 Therac-25], [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professionalism/Rodney_Rocha_and_Columbia Rodney Rocha and Columbia], and [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Professionalism/Apollo_13 Apollo 13]. The greatest risks, if they can even be considered risks, currently posed by growth hacking are consumer annoyance (due to spam and similar methods) and possible theft of another company's user base. As growth hacking continues to become more commonplace among tech companies and expands into other industries, we will likely alter our definition and perception of growth hacking, particularly as it pertains to professionalism and ethics.</text>

=Problem Statement =
The challenge was to design a pet feeder that would allow the owner to limit a pet's access to food and control the quantity of food dispensed at a given time (HS).

= Conceive =
===Why===
The first step in any project needs to begin with defining a solid and concise statement. As our groups were first assigned [https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:Merielle213 Heidi Schultz] had already had an idea of what she wanted to design. Even with a preliminary design [https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:MTomaselli I] knew that there were still a plethora of questions and concerns that needed to be addressed. The first and foremost, which I knew from previous experience, was establishing a client base. Knowing exactly what our customer market was would allow us to gear our design specifically for who we wanted to sell to. For example, I brought up the point that whatever our final product was going to be it needed to be of an appropriate size because having pets I knew that I wouldn't want another bulk item sitting in my living room. The conceive process in any project, especially a group project, is ultimately the most important task of them all. It not only drives a common agreement in moving forward but it is the decision that I refer back to every time there's a question regarding what, specifically, I need to accomplish (MT).

===Original Inspiration===
* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YejpfCDh4Lc Timed Pet food Dispenser]
* [http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-controled-dog-foodtreat-dispenser/ Screw/rotating Feeder Inspiration]
*[http://www.instructables.com/id/RFID-pet-feeder/ RFID-triggered feeder]
* [[File:Heidi's Obese cat.jpg|Heidi's Obese Cat]]

=Design=


===Requirements===
*relatively small
*allow access to food relatively quickly when approached
*hide food relatively quickly if the wrong pet approached  
*easy to clean
*buildable using materials found in the HCC Engineering Lab
*dispense food in 1/4 cup increments
*act in response to a pet wearing or implanted with an RFID chip approaching the apparatus (HS).

===Design Alternatives===
*bowl rotator that would hide 3 bowls and make one accessible at all times- servos we had to work with were not powerful enough to turn a platform holding four bowls, and using a DC motor would have required adding sensors and became unnecessarily complicated.  
*&quot;screw&quot; feeder to dispense food, rather than the final rotating food dispenser.  The screw feeder would have been more complicated to measure the quantity of food, though it may have used less torque to control.

'''Other alternatives considered included:'''
* Automatically dispensed vs. owner-measured food
* Magnet vs. RFID control
* Food inside a transparent box with RFID triggered door-lock vs. food bowl inside containment.
* 3D-printed housing vs. handmade
* Battery vs. corded power supply
(HS).



===Initial Design===
*cylindrical or rectangular housing to hold pet food
*&quot;screw/twisting&quot; style dispenser below it. 
*Food from dispenser fed through a tube to a bowl on a rotating platform
* When a pet approached, an arduino received the signal from an RFID reader and instructed the appropriate bowl to rotate out of a covered compartment and into the open for access, then food would be dispensed into the bowl.  
*Then, the arduino instructed the food dipenser to release the appropriate number of 1/4 cup food increments into the bowl.  
*The RFID reader would read microchips that were either implanted under the pet's skin or worn on a collar.

===Prototypes Needed===
Prototype out of available materials scaled for a small dog or cat
Includes:
*Arduino for control 
*9 volt battery for power
*servos for movement
*Hosing from wood or plastic

The next step would be to create an improved prototype out of superior materials , taking into consideration any feedback or discoveries from Prototype 1 and making appropriate changes.  Once this prototype has been perfected we create scaled up versions in sizes appropriate for larger pets.  The larger versions may need increased torque from a servo and possibly increased power to support the torque-providing device (HS).

===Modeling and simulation===
Each piece of the physical unit was designed in [http://www.sketchup.com/?gclid=CLiC97vUvb0CFWuhOgodq1YAAg Sketchup2014] prior to prototyping.  This allowed for detailed evaluation of specifications and potential issues prior to creation.  I believe this led to a smoother constructions process (HS).  The file can be reached [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i5hj517087f35wr/uDpY-em4Nb here]

File:Feeder box with gear components.png|Feeder box with gear components
&lt;/gallery&gt;
 (HS)

===Aesthetics and human factors===

We attempted to keep the entire apparatus as small in overall size as possible. It takes up a floor space of 12&quot;x6&quot; and a wall space of approximately 6&quot; x 18-24&quot;.

The prototype is not nearly as attractive as the final product ought to be.  Ideally we would use a smooth, attractive plastic for most of the pieces to improve aesthetic value and make cleaning the unit easy.  The final product will also not allow easy access to the moving, electrical, and mechanical components - lids and covers will be secured with screws.


==Final Design==

*3x6x12 inch box with a groove 1/8 inch from the top edge for the lid to slide in
* right side is slightly larger to allow for a piece of rack gear to protrude into the compartment and link with the gear assembly and still be able to retract completely to open
* mounts for the servo (see the below image)
* converted the measurements to inches and used those illustrated in the image below.  
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Futabaspecs.png|Getting servo specs and converting to inches
File:Feeder box.png|Feeder box with gear assembly
&lt;/gallery&gt;

* box lid slides 5.75 inches but the box was only 3 inches high and the servo that turns the gears can only turn 180 degrees. So, any gear that fits inside the box would not have a large enough diameter to have a circumference (that moves the lid) large enough. 
*Gears 0.9 and 2.25 inches in diameter create the proper turning distance of 5.75 inches when the servo turns them '''105.4 degrees'''.

*Gear Creation:
#Sketchup plugin that allows for relatively easy gear creation can be downloaded at ||http://www.ohyeahcad.com/download/%7C%7C. 
# this plugin only works in Sketchup 8 or earlier versions, downloadable at ||http://google-sketchup-pro.en.softonic.com%7C%7C. 
# After downloading both of these files the plugin .rbz file must be manually placed into the Google &gt; Sketchup8 &gt; plugins folder. The gear function is found under menu item Draw &gt; Involute Gear. 
#I left the pressure angle at 20 degrees (If the gear teeth are not perfectly square, that is, they are slightly rounded or cut off at an angle, the pressure angle is the angle between the vertical side of the tooth and the line that angles away from it to the horizontal side of the tooth).
#The teeth and pitch radius determine whether the teeth of two gears fit together. Pitch radius 0.45 and 1.125 inches.  12 and 30 gear teeth respectively. 
# teeth:gear ratio must be the same for each gear  (See images below).

(HS)

The tail end of this semester saw this project passed on to another group which consisted of Carlos Fernandez, Kevin Szostak, Arien Motaher, Asad Gillani,and Eldrick Kinmakon. Our group was able to push the project forward by completing initial design concepts created by the previous group,as well as address concerns that were to be revisited later by the prior group. 

Components that were brought to fruition at this point of the project include:
*3D printed wheel which holds and dispenses food
*Mountable container to release food to wheel

[[File:3d Printed Component.JPG|thumb|3d Printed Component]]

=Implement=
Currently working on the Implement phase of the project, we still have to map out all of the potential dilemmas we face with the project.
&lt;u&gt;'''All files and code prepared for this project can be found [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i5hj517087f35wr/uDpY-em4Nb here].'''&lt;/u&gt;

During the implement phase of the project, the second group was able to take the completed components of the project and attempt to assemble them so as to bring the physical aspect to fruition. A New physical unit was completed utilizing wood, with openings created to affix the following:
* Servo motors
* Arduino Unit
* Food Container

Bolts were inserted into the 3d printed Wheel to help stabilize the unit during motion. The unit was sanded down so that it would pose no risk to any of the team members that worked on it, or any animal that my approach it should it be used. In order to attract any animal that may not know what it was, the unit was spray painted red so as to draw attention.

==Problem Statement==
The challenge was to design a pet feeder that would allow the owner to limit a pet's access to food and control the quantity of food dispensed at a given time.

==The Design Process==
=====Requirements for each element or component derived from system level goals and requirements=====
The pet food bowl housing needed to be relatively small, allow access to food relatively quickly when approached, and hide food relatively quickly if the wrong pet approached.  It also needed to be easy to clean and buildable using materials found in the HCC Engineering Lab.  The food &quot;hopper&quot; which holds the bulk food and dispenses it at the appropriate time also needed to take up as little space as possible, in conjunction with the bowl housing.  It was decided that it should dispense food in 1/4 cup increments.  It also had to be built out of materials in the Engineering lab.  Both of these would be required to act in response to a pet wearing or implanted with an RFID chip approaching the apparatus.


=====Alternatives in design=====
The group initially considered using a bowl rotator that would hide 3 bowls and make one accessible at all times.  This idea was set aside when it became clear that the servos we had to work with were not powerful enough to turn a platform holding four bowls, and using a DC motor would have required adding sensors and became unnecessarily complicated.  It also used a &quot;screw&quot; feeder to dispense food, rather than the final rotating food dispenser.  The screw feeder would have been more complicated to measure the quantity of food, though it may have used less torque to control.  

=====The initial design=====
The initial design consisted of a cylindrical or rectangular housing to hold pet food, with a rotating dispenser below it. Food from that dispenser was fed through a tube to the bowl housing.  The bowl sat in the forward compartment and the components that operate it in the rear compartment. When a pet approached, an arduino received the signal from an RFID reader and instructed the bowl housing to retract its lid.  Then, the arduino instructed the food dipenser to release the appropriate number of 1/4 cup food increments into the bowl.

==Idea==

Make a bicycle turn signal out of LEDs that can be mounted on almost any bike and that gives the user control of the turn signal without losing the ability to also use there arm as a turn signal.

==Problem Statement==
· Each year, more than 500,000 people go to the emergency room for bicycle injuries in the USA. More than 700 people die 
from those injuries. 

· Children 15 years and younger are the biggest risk. 

· Bicycle injuries and deaths cost $8 billion each year.  

·Adolescents/Young people(ages 15-24) and adults aged 45 and older have the highest death rates.

·Males are more likely to get injured than females.

·Most of all bicycle deaths happen in urban areas and non-intersection areas.

==Setting System Goals and Requirements==
===Market/Customer needs===

* Competitive Bike Riders
* Leisurely Bike Riders
* Supply a proactive safety mechanism to a market that lends to $8 billion in annual cost resulting from injury and death. By implementing an easily recognizable safety system, it is not only the biker community that benefits, but automobile operators, and local government- with benefits trickling down to taxpayers as well.

===Factors that set the context of the requirements===

* Customer Needs (MT)
* Cost of Materials (MT)
* Time/Duration of Project (MT)
* Aesthetics (MT)
* Practicality (MT)
* Marketability (MT)
* Available Resources (MT)

=====Enterprise goals and capabilities=====

* Simplicity
* Cost effectiveness
* Employ a product that can easily be integrated in any enterprise scenario that would call for such an item.

=====Competitors and benchmarking information=====



=====Ethical, social, environmental, legal and regulatory influences=====


===System goals and requirements===
=====Initial target goals (based on needs, opportunities and other influences)=====
=====System performance metrics=====

==Defining Function, Concept and Architecture==
===Necessary system functions===

* Provide luminance that projects a minimum of 10ft
* components mounted upon a surface area visible from a minimum of 10ft away
* LED placement distinguishable as arrows
* Ability to indicate movement of two directions (left and right)

===System concepts===

===Trade-offs among concepts===



===High level architectural form and structure===
===The decomposition of form into subsystems, assignment of functions to subsystems, and definition of interfaces===

==Modeling of System and Ensuring Goals Can Be Met==
===Appropriate models of technical performance===
===The plan of implementation and operations===
===Trade-offs among various goals and functions===

==Development Project Management==
===Project cost and schedule===

* Additional Costs (not originally provided by class)
* $7.50 - set of LED Holders
* $7.95 - 25 Pack of LED
* TBD - Cost of 3D printed housing

===Estimation and allocation of resources===
===Risks and alternatives===
*Users could depend on using general hand signals
*Risk of limited sight range

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is about the ''Math Builder'' tool in Microsoft Word versions 2007 and higher. It also applies to Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 and higher. Note that this is a different tool than the legacy tool ''Equation editior 3.0'' and ''Mathtype''.

Typesetting mathematics on a computer has always been a challenge. The mathematical community almost universally accepts a typesetting language called LaTeX. ''Math Builder'' is a much easier to use tool that has less functionality than [[Wikipedia: LaTeX|LaTeX]] but more than typical document processing. Microsoft call this hybrid language the ''Office Math Markup Language'', or OMML for short. It is an appropriate tool for:
*Typing any document whose focus is not itself mathematics.
*Typing a short mathematics document quickly.
*A stepping stone between word processing (MS Word) and typesetting (LaTeX)
Note that Math Builder does not perform any mathematics: it is a tool for displaying it.

== Pros and Cons ==
'''Pros:'''
*Math Builder is [[Wikipedia: WYSIWYG|WYSIWYG]]: after typing an equation you see immediately what it looks like.
*It's easy to get started: it's already built in to Microsoft Word. Common symbols have point-and-click icons.
*It's easy to use: Common symbols have keyboard shortcuts so that a veteran user need not use a mouse at all.
*Nearly all symbols use the same commands as LaTeX. 
*The format used is non-proprietary and given in Unicode Technical Note #28. 

'''Cons:'''
*Some uncommon symbols are not listed in the menu and require knowing the keyboard shortcut. Typically this is the LaTeX code for the symbol.
*There are differences between Math Builder and LaTeX code: advanced functionality that requires more than just a symbol tend to follow the same flavor but have slightly different syntax. Math Builder code tends to be shorter than LaTeX code and disappears upon completion to the WYSIWYG output. Examples here are matrices, multiple aligned equations, and binomial coefficients.
*No LaTeX typesetting tools such as labels and references are implemented.
*No highly advanced LaTeX tools such as graphing, commutative diagrams, or geometric shapes are implemented.
*Students studying mathematics might not be motivated to learn LaTeX because they might be able to get by with ''Equation Builder'' in Word to satisfy the vast majority of their needs. However, when such a student reaches the limits, unlike LaTeX there is absolutely no recourse to expand the program to satisfy it.

== Inserting an equation ==
Microsoft Word has two different typing environments: text and math. To obtain the math environment, click on &quot;Equation&quot; on the &quot;Insert&quot; ribbon. The keyboard shortcut is &quot;alt&quot;+ &quot;=&quot;. Everything you type in this environment is considered math: all automatic formatting of text is disabled. To exit the math environment, click on any text outside the math environment. One easy way to do this is by pressing the right arrow key.

== Common Mathematics ==
=== Fractions ===
There are multiple ways to display a fraction. The default is vertically aligned as illustrated below. Obtain this by typing the fraction and pressing space: '''1/2'''

&lt;MATH&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/MATH&gt;

=== Parenthesis, brackets, and braces ===
Grouping symbols will automatically size to the appropriate size. These symbols include &quot;(), {}, [], ||&quot;. For instance, the expression below can be obtained with '''(1/2(x+1))''':

&lt;MATH&gt;\left (\frac{1}{2}(x+1)\right )&lt;/MATH&gt;

(Be careful to press space after the &quot;2&quot; to render the fraction, otherwise Word might put &quot;x+1&quot; in the denominator.)
=== Exponents and subscripts ===
Exponents can be obtained by using &quot;^&quot; and subscripts by &quot;_&quot;. The monomial below can be obtained by typing '''x_2^5''' or '''x^5_2''' and pressing space. 

&lt;MATH&gt;x_2^5&lt;/MATH&gt; 

=== Symbols: &lt;MATH&gt;\neq, \leq, \subseteq, \vee, \rightarrow, \Rightarrow &lt;/MATH&gt; etc ===
These are all common symbols. The easiest thing to do would be to find a LaTeX reference sheet. A few of those symbols are shown here:
{| class = &quot;wikitable&quot;
|code
|output
|-
|\neq
|&lt;MATH&gt;\neq&lt;/MATH&gt;
|-
|\leq or &lt;=
|&lt;MATH&gt;\leq&lt;/MATH&gt;
|-
|\subseteq
|&lt;MATH&gt;\subseteq&lt;/MATH&gt;
|-
|\vee
|&lt;MATH&gt;\vee&lt;/MATH&gt;
|-
|\rightarrow
|&lt;MATH&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/MATH&gt;
|-
|\Rightarrow
|&lt;MATH&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/MATH&gt;
|}

=== Greek, Script, and Fraktur letters ===
The math environment implements 3 fronts in addition to the default. 
*Greek letters can be obtained by typing a &quot;\&quot; followed by the name of symbol. Capitalizing it creates a capital letter. '''\delta \Delta''' produces &lt;MATH&gt;\delta \Delta&lt;/MATH&gt;
*Script letters can be obtained by typing &quot;\&quot; followed by &quot;script&quot; followed by the letter. '''\scriptd \scriptD''' produces &lt;MATH&gt;\mathcal{d} \mathcal{D}&lt;/MATH&gt;
*Fraktur letters can be obtained by typing &quot;\&quot; followed by &quot;fraktur&quot; followed by the letter. Fraktur does not have capitals. '''\frakd''' prodouces &lt;MATH&gt;\mathfrak{d}&lt;/MATH&gt;

=== Blackboard Bold letters ===
Blackboard bold letters can be obtained by typing &quot;\&quot; followed by &quot;double&quot; followed by the letter. '''\doubled \doubleD''' produces &lt;MATH&gt;\mathbb{d} \mathbb{D}&lt;/MATH&gt;


=== Matrices ===
Matrices are obtained with the &quot;\matrix&quot; symbol. Use parenthesis to start and end the matrix. Use &quot;@&quot; to separate rows, and &quot;&amp;&quot; to separate columns. The matrix below can be created by typing '''[\matrix(1&amp;2&amp;3@4&amp;5&amp;6)]'''.

&lt;MATH&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 1&amp;2&amp;3\\4&amp;5&amp;6\end{bmatrix}&lt;/MATH&gt;



=== Multiple Aligned Equations ===
Aligning equations can be obtained with the &quot;eqarray&quot; symbol. Use parenthesis to stat and end the matrix. Use &quot;@&quot; to separate equations. Use &quot;&amp;&quot; to specify alignment and whitespace. The first &quot;&amp;&quot; and then every other occurrence is alignment. The second and then every other occurrence is white space. The equations below can be obtained by typing the following text:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\eqarray(2&amp;x+&amp;3&amp;y=5@&amp;x+&amp;&amp;y=7)&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;MATH&gt;\begin{align}2&amp;x+&amp;3&amp;y=5\\&amp;x+&amp;&amp;y=7\end{align}&lt;/MATH&gt;

(The math environment here seems to be adding excess space between the alignments that doesn't occur in Word)

== Inline versus Display ==
Equations have two forms. '''Inline''' specifies that the equation is to be in line with text. This affects a few expressions to make them appear smaller. For instance fractions will use a smaller font. Summations and integrals will place the endpoints to the right of the symbol instead of below it.
'''Display''' specifies to use as much space as needed. Display mode equations must appear on their own line.

== Modifying and creating shortcuts ==
Everything in Math Builder requires special symbols that the computer knows how to interpret. These symbols are constructed with all the commands starting with &quot;\&quot; as illustrated in the above sections. This is implemented via ''math autocorrect'' which you can modify. For instance, you might like to use \ra instead of \rightarrow. You can do this by adding the command to the ''math autocorrect'' directory.</text>

==Dotting the t's and crossing the i's==
Hey, now more than ever I just wanted to suggest cleaning up what we've already got.  We have a ton of great info already, and I feel we've more than covered the appropriate areas, and rather than just throwing in more bits and bobs I'd say perfecting what we do should be a priority.  Generally just bringing formatting and such in line throughout the page, correcting any spelling or grammar errors, really just polishing what we've got till it's good an' shiny and professional!  Hope that's not a problem George? ;D [[User:Flailkerrin|Flailkerrin]] ([[User talk:Flailkerrin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Flailkerrin|contribs]]) 15:56, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah I think its a good idea just to clean things up a bit because we have loads of information and I think we have covered pretty much everything. Adding some pictures is a good touch and maybe linking things to other pages ect. And also making sure all the grammar and spelling is correct. Do we have until the end of the day to do all of this yeah? [[User:Heyrach|Heyrach]] ([[User talk:Heyrach|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Heyrach|contribs]]) 16:10, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I don't know, timewise. I just know that Kelly.marvel and I have been doing some serious polishing/editing for consistency (like the 'always-on' stuff) as well as for content. If you others are confident in your formatting skills (I'm not so confident in mine), have at it!

Hello there guys! Has anyone else been having some serious trouble with editing conflicts preventing them posting things to the Wikibook?  The past few times I've tried to add or edit it just won't let me and my text just disappears. I don't know it's just me are not... From now on I'm writing stuff on word like Greg suggested before,but it's been infuriating! How have other people been finding it? [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

Hi Lottie, don't know if this will be too late but when an editing conflict occurs you just need to click back the page to get your work back. Then just copy and paste it into the new version. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 16:36, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys. I was wondering if we should include sub headings within the Main concepts section for each concept ? Was thinking it would be a good way to organize the different concepts? What do you guys think ? ([[User:Kaf00023|Kaf00023]] ([[User talk:Kaf00023|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kaf00023|contribs]]) 22:34, 24 March 2014 (UTC))


Hey. I agree, I think having subheadings will make the page look more organised and professional. I think that we should start with a detailed description of the actual idea of Always-On Culture and then move on to Turkle and Boyd's ideas, each under their own subheading. What does everyone think? Also, is there something obvious I have missed? [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 15:34, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

Should we change the main concepts to be more a section for each thinker than each concepts, or just add each of the main thinkers at the end or start of the section ? ([[User:Kaf00023|Kaf00023]] ([[User talk:Kaf00023|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kaf00023|contribs]]) 22:41, 27 March 2014 (UTC))

Hi guys. I wanted to put in something about the fact that teenagers are more associated with &quot;always-on culture&quot; than any other group of people. Any suggestions of where, under which sub-heading, I should put it? Thanks! [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 13:50, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

''''reduced context cues'''' why the double bold here and not elsewhere? Try to be consistent with formatting :o) [[User:GregXenon01|GregXenon01]] ([[User talk:GregXenon01|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GregXenon01|contribs]]) 15:07, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Sorry about the double bold on social context cues it was a mistake on my part when making the sub heading and i didn't notice the error till today, however I've fixed it now and will check more carefully next time. As for teenagers being more associated with 'always on culture' you could work it into the idea of being part of a network as they would presumably be the largest part of said network and the implications of that ? ([[User:Kaf00023|Kaf00023]] ([[User talk:Kaf00023|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kaf00023|contribs]]) 22:58, 28 March 2014 (UTC))

We should be sure to remain consistent with danah boyd's name. Some people are capitalising it when she is known for having it in lower case (even her Wikipedia page has it in lower case). (If anyone is dead against lower case just say here so everyone knows to put it like that). Thanks! [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 16:53, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Should we capitalize boyd's name when it is in the beginning of the sentence? --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 17:55, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Good idea about putting the idea about teenagers being more associated with always on in the networking section. Thanks. I think if her name is lower case even on her Wikipedia page that we should keep it lower case throughout. [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:14, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I've noticed that there are several different ways that we are saying &quot;Always-On Culture&quot;. Some have upper and lower case, some all upper case, some all lower case and some are in and some are out of quotations. I think they should all be the same, with perhaps the exception of the first time it should be in upper case. Do you think it should have &quot;&quot; quotations or ''? [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:33, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I agree Kathryn that we need to be a bit more consistent in the formatting of the words &quot;Always On Culture&quot;. In the module handbook and all our other course material the topic is refered to as 'Always On' Culture - with the culture aspect being titled as 'Always On' not an entire clause phrase and capitalising the C in 'Culture'. I hope that's helpful, what do others think? [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

I think we should go with what the handbook says. Also, are we putting the references in alphabetical order? Do you think it would look better or do you think they should be in line with where they are in the text? As in, if the reference comes first in the text should it come first in the reference list? [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 19:02, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I'm not sure about the references - alphabetical will probably look better but the majority of Wiki pages/books have them in the order they are references in [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 19:17, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

More the fact that in order to fully function, and effectively act out 'spontaneous' action, the mob has to be always on i.e. in order to quickly muster for a project with a deadline (us) or for like a protest (like what happened in Eygpt). Anyone think its relevant enough to add in? Just to reference another chapter?

Oh yeh, just clocked the online identity page... They have a hell of a lot more content than us haha. We might have to do more reading, &lt;u&gt;if&lt;/u&gt; there is anymore stuff to read about this!

In Turkle's work on the 'tethered self' she tied in a lot of other topics such as &quot;connections that matter&quot; and &quot;new forms of validation.&quot; I think it would be useful to add in subheadings under the 'tethered self' discussing these topics as well. Some content that we can include is a portion about the positive and negative aspects of being 'always on.'  --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 16:17, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I think the idea of putting in the section of smart mobs is a really good idea! That way, like you said, we have linked in to other topics. Do you think it should be under it's own heading or a sub-heading of something else?

Hi. I've added some more information to the introduction, so that it has a bit more depth. However, I do not think that the introduction should be too long.

I just wanted to say, I was going to link one of my paragraphs to the page on Online Identity.

I think we should definitely include the section on disconnectivity anxiety, it's not something that was covered in the lectures so I think it would be a good thing to research and add.

Hey George... just saw your additions to the main page! Looking good! However, I was wondering if that should maybe be moved down under the other main topics. I'm just opening that point up for potential discussion as it's still relevant but I think the book should start off with more about &quot;Always On&quot; itself. Readers who don't know what &quot;Always On&quot; is might need more information up front. Thoughts everybody?

Sorry, I'm just coming onto the discussion page after a break so I'm still getting caught up, forgive me! Another thought I had while looking at the page that we've talked about but haven't put up yet is the younger gen/workplace differences in an &quot;Always On&quot; culture. I know in our 4KR group disc page we talked about this... here's a [[User_talk:RedheadRachel|link]]! I was going to include that section and have some information but if someone else is already on top of it, I am willing to add my sources and findings to the pot!

Hey guys, I found a book by Naomi Baron called &quot;Always On: Language in an Online and Mobile World&quot; dont think this has been mentioned yet so do you guys think it would be a good idea to put her under key theorists??

Thanks for any help [[User:Heyrach|Heyrach]] ([[User talk:Heyrach|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Heyrach|contribs]]) 12:55, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I think it's a really good idea to put that in! I think the more outside sources we have and information that wasn't in the lecture, the better it will be.

Hey guys. I just wanted to let you know that I have put a link in one of my paragraphs which will direct you to the page on Online Identity.

I was going to add stuff to the advantages of always on although i am finding it hard to find things to back up what I think tha advatages are. Are we allowed to write advantages with having quotes from books? I thought a couple of advantages would be like 1. The idea of being always on means we are connected to the world 24/7 which means as soon as anything happens we can find out about it and we live in a world where everyone needs information fast which would then lead on the a second point 2. Information is so fast and always so available that being always on saves us a lot of time having when retrieving information 3. Always having such powerful technology at our finger tips is such a huge step in the technology world that it should always be a tool to help us rather than to put us at a disadvantage as it was designed to improve our lives and keep us connected. These are just some rough idea I had, if anyone has any sources that would back up my ideas and if you think they are good ideas we could maybe work on them together and come up with a couple of paragraphs.

A lot of content has been added today, some of it is really solid.  I was going to suggest the link to online identity, as that makes more sense than doubling up on semi-relevant information here.  I'd say go ahead and add to the advantages of Always-On, as it feels rather bare without.  We can then try and find academic work to back it up, however if we can't find it we can scrap it later if need be.  I think we really need to be careful with not putting in information just for the sake of information.  There is a whole ton of description of ethernet cables and the like that has no place here and just cluttters up the page.  These could instead be replaced with links to information if need be, but either way, we need to cut out a lot of it.

Hi guys - re Rachel and Kelly's input re the order of 'Being On' etc. I agree and have moved this down to the bottom of the list and changed 'Being' to 'Always' (no idea why I didn't do that in the first place!).

I agree that we need to be careful that we aren't just posting information for the sake of it. Our book needs to be full but it also needs to be full of relevant information.

Wow, the amount of work done to the page since I looked at it last 9 hours ago, it's black and white! Such an improvement guys! The page has more flow and so much information! Just looking over the page, I was wondering if anyone had any creative editing tricks to break up some of the longer paragraphs. For example, &quot;Tethering&quot; and &quot;Part of the Network&quot; contain great information but appears as a big block of text that I was tempted to skim rather than read. I'm reaching out to you guys because I'm not sure that I am familiar enough with wikibooks to do it! Any clever ideas?

 [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]], I saw that you added some stuff to the draft I had on my user page, do you mind if I go ahead and start the bit for the workforce? I'll put it up and add what you've come up with! 
I'm also jumping in on this a bit late but I like adding Naomi Baron to the theorists list because I actually included quite a bit from her book in my draft and thought it was a good source!

I'll take a look at it! Some of the sources I've read include non-technological media as a problem in an &quot;Always On&quot; culture. I wouldn't take it down but I'll look and see what I can add/change! [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 22:02, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

If I'm being completely honest I do think it sounds a bit too opinionated! It is good though. I'll have a search for some relevant sources related to newspapers just now and I'll add to it if I find anything good.

First off, I'm eternally sorry for completely spacing on the fact that the pages themselves have a discussion section. Can very much understand if this has caused irritation when I've edited things without warning or explanation. Way to do the whole 'civility' thing, me... Anyway; something I'm thinking is that at points the information seems rather jumbled? For instance; in the 'tethering' section, the second paragraph seems to be out of place when considering that the third explains that we are 'tethered' to our devices, when the second sounds like that concept's already been explained. Not too much of a major issue, but would be nice to tidy up shop, I guess? --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 22:52, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

No it's totally alright! I had no idea until seminar that our page had its own discussion page. Here I had been doing everything on my user page. Oh well. Before i jump into my comment, I do agree that we just need a pair of eyes or two to comb through the book for clarity, consistency, and flow. I'll do a sweep once I put my paragraphs in. Anyone else? 

Also, I have a section that relates to the &quot;Connected Young&quot; section; however, the information I have doesn't really belong under the disadvantages heading. Does anyone object if we make Young/Workplace its own subheading? Some of the existing information in Connected Young isn't necessarily negatives. I don't deny that it does pose a problem that we can't keep some of the information in the disadvantages category but a good point of &quot;Always On&quot; is how it directly affects youth and those in the workplace. Thoughts? [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 23:29, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I think it would depend on how much information was there? Simply because there isn't all that much of the 'connected young' section so far in the disadvantages? Even if the last line doesn't sound too much like a negative? (Maybe that would be a better quote for elsewhere?
I added a section to the end of 'part of the network' from a case study I found about the rates of depression going up when people experience 'internet stress'. It's not so very long, so I was wondering if it would be worth adding the term to the glossary? --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 23:39, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey, was just thinking the page was pretty intimidating with the sheer amount of block text there is, so it'd be good to add some pictures to break things up, like we did on the blog assignments.

I'm not sure if the first paragraph under the &quot;tethering&quot; section is relevant to our chapter. What do you guys think? --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 10:58, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Just noticed that we have still been using various forms of 'always on' and I think we need to pick a definite way to use it espcially since it's the title our chapter. Does anyone have any preferences for which way we write it?

I think we don't need the first paragraph in 'tethering' if we add it to the glossary (I know we have one on the 'tethered self' but maybe just put in what the term itself means?) As for the 'always on' bit, I too have been irked by this! The title of our chapter seems to suggest that 'always-on' is the best way to go? (with the dash and without capitalization.) --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 11:19, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, should we split the 'advantages' section into further subsections? simply because it's a wall of text right now whereas the disadvantages is all broken up. --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 11:23, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I agree with using 'always-on', should I go through and make the changes now or wait until tomorrow when people are done adding and altering content? I think it's a good idea to add that paragraph of &quot;tethering&quot; to the glossary because it seems unnecessary in the section. --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 11:26, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Can't hurt to start changing it into 'always-on' now. If people slip up later we can do it then as well. As for tethering, I'll copy and paste that to the glossary now. --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 11:30, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Okay, I'll start that now. Also, is there a reason for the quotations in the &quot;Part of 'The Network'&quot; section being italicized and separated from the rest of the text? This is the only section with this type of formatting. --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 11:31, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi everyone, just a couple of little things: There is a section &quot;Change in the Workforce&quot; under disadvantages of &quot;Always-on&quot; with no content under it. Is someone still to add there? Also, is there a reason for danah boyd's name to be capitalised for the link to her wiki page?

[[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 12:06, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I just added headings to the advantages section to break it up as was discussed here. Does everyone think it looks okay? Could I also maybe suggest having some titles underlined to make the page more readable? It seems to be just a collection of slightly different sized fonts and sometimes proves difficult to separate sections when reading. Regarding the term &quot;disinhibition&quot;, it is referred to as &quot;dis-inhibition&quot; on the main page as if someone has just corrected it to Google's spell checker, but did Greg not say it wasn't a word anyway? I'm sure it is referred to without the hyphen in the lecture notes. Should we change it? [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 12:20, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

To whoever wrote the section on cognitive surplus, I added in a few bits and bobs about that and 'smart mobs'. It's a little bit head-scratching at first, the example of the Taliban mainly, but I thought it was relevant + an interesting perspective. Have a read and let me if I should change anything. Plus (in general) I added in a section about privacy, which I thought was very interesting if anyone wants to add to it.

Also, I'm our page has so much content already that I don't necessarily need to add another new idea so, for now, I'm combing through the current page, looking for consistency and flow. Sound okay? I already fixed some of the &quot;always-on&quot; that we had previously missed. Also, can I take off your contrib records? Other pages don't include the contribs in the actual text. It will still be obvious for a person going to look for your work (i.e. Greg) via page history/user history. Does anyone have a problem with this? 
Point number two, I'm going to add to the change in the workforce section as I just found a new source! [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 14:31, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey Rachel, I understand the whole contribs thing, I thought I had edited them all out. It's hard to sift through all the content on the page but I'll use search and replace and do that just now. What way are we deciding to write &quot;always-on&quot; &lt;&lt;Like this for all sections? Is there anything we can afford to lose as we seem to have so much information which may not be entirely necessary and difficult to navigate. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 15:17, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I think to make the chapter flow better we should move &quot;'Always-On': The Different Means of Getting Connected&quot; and &quot;Participants in an &quot;always-on culture&quot; to be the first main concepts to introduce firstly who participates and how we can be &quot;always-on&quot;. It makes more sense to start here instead of going straight into &quot;Tethering&quot;. What does everyone think? [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 16:34, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I agree with that move! And as to the 'always-on'... &lt;--- that's how we're doing it! 'always-on' culture if you need it all! [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 17:31, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Rob, in reference to you adding the section on privacy. I found a quote from danah boyd on privacy but ironically she's arguing that social media gives you more real life privacy. I wanted to add it but I'm not quite sure where to put it as her view is that it's an advantage of being always on. Any ideas? [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 17:47, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I agree with you Gemma. I think it would have a much nicer flow, which I think is super important. You don't want to read something that jumps all over the place! [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 17:55, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys, under the &quot;Toxic disinhibition,&quot; &quot;Origins of the Internet and its Legacy,&quot; &quot;Youth: Unplugged,&quot; &quot;Uplugged: The study,&quot; Tethered to the Workplace,&quot; &quot;Instant Information,&quot; &quot;Development of Different Skills,&quot; &quot;The Connected Young,&quot; and &quot;Marshall McLuhan&quot; sections there are either unclear or absent references that need to be changed from APA to match the rest of the references. If you worked on one of these sections then please change them or put the reference information here so that I can insert the reference.--[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 18:01, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey. I noticed that the paragraph on &quot;Youth: Unplugged&quot; section was the same as the one I already did on the Connected Young so I have joined the two paragraphs together and put it back under the &quot;Youth: Unplugged&quot; heading and deleted my previous paragraph. I hope this is okay with everyone. In regards to the referencing, I will add the ones I have put in under this section now. [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:09, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Looking good, guys! Though anyone adding something for 'Blurring between virtual and reality' under danah boyd? Looks rather strange just sitting there on its own. --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 18:53, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I think it's all looking really good! Whoever thought about the pictures - great idea! It look much better being broken up a little. Anything else need tidying up? I'm going to have a quick read through it all now and see if anything needs doing. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 20:03, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

The newspaper section under convergence still needs some work. It seems slightly out of place and doesn't read like the rest of the book. I think it has to be done more in relation to always on rather than just a focus on the decline of the newspaper industry. [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 21:31, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

If you could put them into footnote form, that would be much appreciated. As people seem to agree with the change of the layout, I shall do that. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 22:08, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm not sure how to add photos or edit them, but I noticed that the McLuhan one doesn't have a title like the others. If someone could change that please? [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 22:13, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Siobhan - I just added the caption. Wasn't sure how to do it before but I managed to work it out. Thanks for pointing that out. I've changed the layout now, if I've missed anything let me know. [[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 22:41, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks for the references for the McLuhan section! --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 10:03, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

The referencing section is super bugging me right now. Would anyone object to having the two parts divided into 'references' and 'notes' like the [[Digital_Media_and_Culture_Yearbook_2014/Chapter_2:_Online_Identity#Notes|online identity page]] has done? --[[User:IsmayH|IsmayH]] ([[User talk:IsmayH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsmayH|contribs]]) 10:36, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

The problem at this stage is that everyone is still trying to add new information or expand greater on points that have already been made, but in many places it just reads badly as it's too repetitive. I'd say what we need to do now is look closely at each set ion and try and make certain parts more concise and to the point. [[User:Cir00004|Cir00004]] ([[User talk:Cir00004|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cir00004|contribs]]) 11:36, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks Gemma! It was bugging me a little. And yeah, I'm just going through the page at the moment and seeing which bits need little edits and which points are repeating themselves or need a little expansion. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 12:17, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

We have disinhibition in both the main concepts and definitions section. Should it just be put into one so it isn't repeating things? I can try to work it together somehow. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 13:10, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

After finally figuring out how to do the number reference thing, I've changed all my citations! Sorry about that. Also, I have my afternoon free so I'm comfortable with going through the page and editing. I agree that our page is unnecessarily long and if you read it top to bottom, there is more than one repetitive paragraph. I can see what I can do about that if you guys want. [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 14:00, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I think that's a good idea because there does seem to be repetitive information. I will try to go through and edit as well. --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 14:24, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Does anyone think we should add more to cultural determinism? It's looking a bit thin. --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 14:57, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Just noticed that we have two disinhibition sections, should we combine the two or just get rid of one? --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 15:38, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Haha.... just had that same thought I was going to post! I think we should combine them under main concepts... thoughts? [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 15:28, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

For a stronger book chapter, I think we should lead with the main concepts. By leading with the definitions, we are introducing too many ideas too fast. Also, I'm combining the two disinhibition sections because they say nearly the same thing. [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 15:37, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I agree. I think that definitions and glossary are too similar of sections to have. Definitely combine the disinhibition sections. We might have to do that with the two determinism sections as well. --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 15:38, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I wonder if we should move the definitions sections (that aren't repetitive) as their own subheading under main concepts and then we can lead the main concepts section with the most relevant ideas to 'always-on'. Online disinhibition and the like is important to our topic but it's not the most important. [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 15:41, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I think that's a good idea. How should we approach the determinism sections? --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 15:45, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I'll look at those now. [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 15:49, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

== Referencing ==

FOOTNOTE HELP. Am I being silly or have I missed how to add in a footnote? Had a look around my text box but can't find. Thanks for your time [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:20, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Actually Just to bring it to everyone's attention we have two types of referencing going on... we will need to go through and just have one type... [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:30, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I agree, what type of reference should we stick with? --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 17:49, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I am thinking APA seen as most of it is styled with it, just means we would have to find those who have done the few parts in foot notes to change? I think it would be more difficult to footnote as we would have to go through all the references and match them up to specific numbers [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 17:58, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

My only concern is that footnotes look more like a Wikibook to me and less like an essay. What are your thoughts on that? If we decide to go with footnotes, I can go through and format all of them --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 18:12, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I think that would be ok, just if someone would help you or go over it to make sure nothing is missed or anything. It does look more like other projects. would be good to get some other people's opinion on it too but I think it sounds good. [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 18:29, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey thanks for pointing this out Hollie. Wiki only asks that we are consistent so that is what we should aim for. I must admit, I like Kelly's idea of making it more like a Wikibook and although many have gone for APA (us included) if Kelly is offering to format it the way she suggests then I say we go for it. I was going to ask the rest of my own team but this might take a while to get overall consensus based on how Wiki works (!) so why don't we just ask the nice Kelly to change it to a single consistent format - that way we will be in line with Wiki's standards - and if anyone has any energy left to change it to another consistent format then they can feel free to do it. How does that sound?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 18:52, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey! I agree with you all concerning APA as my group chose that for referencing and I think it is the style most people have used.  I personally like the idea of footnotes but I don't mind if we don't use them.  Like George says, consistency is key. [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 20:12, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

The APA style that seems to be mostly used at the moment sounds good to me! It shoudn't be too different to change the ones that don't fit the style on Friday if need be. [[User:SiobhanDMC|SiobhanDMC]] ([[User talk:SiobhanDMC|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SiobhanDMC|contribs]]) 20:17, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

About to fix some of my referencing, so is the consensus no footnotes? [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 20:25, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Sounds good, Kelly go ahead if you are feeling up to it, if not we can just style it all to APA on Friday [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 20:34, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I'll get on it tonight! --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 21:35, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Ugh, I hate editing conflicts. I'll try this again. I was just saying that I think we should avoid APA in-text citations if possible as it reads more like an essay, instead of a Wikibook/Wikipedia page. I clicked on a random WikiBook page and found this one which I like the citation style it uses: [[Natural and Cultural History of North-East Australia's Wet Tropical Forests]]. It appears clearer but in the interest of time, I'll keep citing using APA. If, on Friday, we have time, we can work to change it to a different style. Unless Kelly is up for it! I don't want to be pushy! Kelly.marvel is a star! [[User:RedheadRachel|RedheadRachel]] ([[User talk:RedheadRachel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RedheadRachel|contribs]]) 21:46, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Like a few of the others have said, I'm sure we'll be fine using any of the suggested referencing styles as long as we keep it consistent throughout. It may be an idea to sneak a peek at the other book chapters and see how the other groups are referencing. [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 21:53, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I've already started changing the citations to keep them consistent. However, under the &quot;toxic dis-inhibition effect&quot; section, there is a reference to BBC 2011 but I cannot find any link matching the name and date. Could someone let me know what this is referencing? --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 22:13, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Same goes for the ABC 2011 reference in that section--[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 22:15, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Under the 'Advantages' section, there are two references (Fred Stutzman, Carnegie Mellon) and (Laura B. Weiss, 2012) that are not referenced at the bottom --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 22:32, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

This may be a silly question but how do we go about changing the citations to match this when we add new content. I don't want to mess up all of your hard work! [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 22:51, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

In order to figure out how to reference, all you have to do is look at the book through edit mode. I would show you exactly what to type but then it comes up as a citation on here. You can look at this &lt;ref&gt; insert full citation &lt;/ref&gt; on the edit mode of the discussion page in order to see the formatting if that is easier. I hope that helps! If you're having diffucltly then let me know what section you're working on and I can insert the reference --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 10:34, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Thank you, that does help. I'll give it a go and I'll let you know if I do get stuck, thanks. [[User:Katrinamcaleer|Katrinamcaleer]] ([[User talk:Katrinamcaleer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katrinamcaleer|contribs]]) 17:14, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I think that the idea of making it more like a wikibook by using footnotes is a great idea! I am going to attempt to put the references I have used into footnotes but I see that Kelly is offering help if anyone needs it, there is a strong possibility I may so thanks in advance!

Is the information we we have to have in the footnotes the same that is in the APA reference? Also, are the reference in bullet points the ones that have to be deleted after they have been made into footnotes? [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:18, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Okay, so I have put in the footnotes in the paragraphs I have done. I'm still unsure about whether the references in bullet points have to be deleted when they are turned into footnotes. I'm assuming that we do so I am just going to delete them from that list. I have all of the information in case I wasn't supposed to so I can put them back in.

== Link to your page? ==

Hey guys, I'm doing the section on Technological Imperative from the Tech Determinism page - basically this idea is that whatever developments we could make with technology, we will just because we can. This fits with y'alls work on inhibition; people will lose sense of whether they should do something online simply because they can push the limits. Would it be alright if I linked to y'alls page from this section? 

Thanks!

== Glossary ==

Just a wee thought, would be good if we could keep the glossary in alphabetical order? I will do it the now and if any one adds any more just put in in the correct way. Looks neater and easier to read especially if more is to be added. Happy editing [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 14:17, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Actually the glossary is a bit of a riot and needs some TLC, there are repeats and the layout is all different so I will go ahead and edit it to make it all consistent [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 14:24, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Are we also going to add a list of 'contributors' at the end of our page? I notice that other groups have done so. [[User:JustHollie|JustHollie]] ([[User talk:JustHollie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JustHollie|contribs]]) 15:14, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Some of my group, including myself, put our names under the 'contributors' title on the main page.  But it may be a good idea to add it to this page as well.

{{Text-box|This is a resource page, and certainly &lt;big&gt;'''''not''' part of the book meant for direct viewing''&lt;/big&gt; by readers.}}
;usage
Use this page as if a template, but put the call into main space mode by inserting a leading colon just like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
 {{:Trainz/Trainz Highest Ver}}&lt;/pre&gt;
Otherwise, without the lead colon, the call will be processed to template namespace.

Just use in-line in a sentence following the V- or V like this:
* The version number (or Trainz-build value), range from V-1.0 to V-3.7, and corresponds to requirements Trainz places on 3D asset data definitions&amp;mdash;and ''when found in an asset {{TR|R|Config.txt file|p=configuration file}}, tells the software suite the way they are to be processed. The older the version, the more translation steps to display the 3D models in the current latest versions. It's a clever system that has allowed Trainz route builders access to literally hundreds of thousands of assets from the {{TL|Download Station}}. 
&lt;hr&gt;
*where the sentence part is formed literally as shown here:
 range from V-1.0 to V-&lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Trainz Highest Ver}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and corresponds to

[[Category:Trainz|$Highest]][[Category:Trainz Templates|$Highest]]
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
	[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_manipulation Photo manipulation] software is not new, but recently it is generating controversy. While the public generally accepts that [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop Photoshop] will be used for retouching purposes (lighting, flyaway hair, skin imperfections, and such), [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKQdwjGiF-s viral videos] demonstrate the astonishing transformation a model’s pictures undergo between a photo shoot and publication. This transformation is rooted in altering models’ bodies, often so drastically that the original model is unrecognizable in the final picture. Many famous figures, including actress [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lena_Dunham Lena Dunham] and supermodel [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Crawford Cindy Crawford], recognize the unrealistic representations of celebrities presented in magazines. When Crawford was asked how she maintains the level of beauty people see pictured, she responded, &quot;Even I don't look like Cindy Crawford”&lt;ref&gt; (1993, January 11). People Magazine. Retrieved from http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20149820,00.html &lt;/ref&gt;.  Body image alterations set unrealistic expectations about how a person should look. Is the use of photo editing software highlighting the best the model could look, or is it simply displaying an altered reality?

==In The News==
Target recently suffered from media and customer backlash for mistakenly publishing junior bathing suit advertisements on their website with blatant Photoshop errors, including [http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1717746.1394555823!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_970/target12n-2-web.jpg jagged edges under the model’s arm], [http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e254b711483e4040a126d2d41a9ab6ebf62a8f6c/c=228-0-1185-719&amp;r=x404&amp;c=534x401/local/-/media/KARE/KARE/2014/03/12//1394665160000-Target-Photoshop.jpg a chunk missing at the apex of the model’s thighs], and [http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1671428/thumbs/o-TARGET-570.jpg?7 impossibly lengthened arms]. The error was addressed online and went viral. Much of the outrage stems from the images marketing to juniors who look to the media to set expectations about the way they should look. If the digital artist had used the correct tools or taken time to edit precisely before the image was published, many would have never guessed the images were Photoshopped. The response towards Target was harsh because the almost farcical errors made it obvious they intended to use Photoshop to alter the shape of the model’s body. Altering body images in the media is offensive to many, primarily because of the hypothesized links between media pressure and psychological disorders, such as depression and eating disorders&lt;ref&gt; Shaw, J., &amp; Waller, G. (1995). The Media’s Impact on Body Image: Implications for Prevention and Treatment. Eating Disorders, 3(2), 115–123. &lt;/ref&gt;.

==False Advertising==
Beyond the psychological implications of photo manipulation in magazines, there are problems with maintaining integrity in advertisements. Despite general awareness that photos in magazines are manipulated, most often a reader of a magazine does not consciously register that the images displayed have been drastically altered. One industry in which honesty is especially difficult to regulate is the beauty industry. The goal of an advertisement is primarily to entice the audience to purchase a product, but to what extent is it ethical to represent a beauty product with a manipulated image? 

In some cases, companies have crossed this line. For example, a [http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/4f298902eab8eaff5200002b-1200/julia-roberts-lancome-uk.jpg Lancome advertisement depicting Julia Roberts] was banned in the United Kingdom because the makeup was advertised to removed wrinkles and crow’s feet, but the company used photo manipulation to remove these features from the picture. This type of false advertising can mislead consumers. Deception in advertising can drive uninformed purchases. If [http://progressive.kelbymediagroup.com/scottkelby/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/peoplemag.jpg Kelly Clarkson appears on the cover of a magazine promoting a diet and exercise regimen] she claims worked for her, the readers would expect that her picture conveys the results of this regimen. If the readers knew her figure had been altered in the picture, they could adjust their expectations, putting less faith in a regimen which has not demonstrated its results fairly to the readers.

==Julia Bluhm, SPARK, &amp; Seventeen Magazine==
[http://livingmyhilife.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/julia-bluhm-learning-blog480.jpg Julia Bluhm] is a high school student from Pittsfield, Massachusetts training to be a professional ballerina &lt;ref&gt;The SPARKteam | SPARK Movement. (n.d.). SPARK Movement RSS. Retrieved May 2, 2014, from http://www.sparksummit.com/sparkteam/&lt;/ref&gt;. As expected with a highly physical sport obsessed with how the performers look on stage, she listened to many of her peers talk about &quot;feeling bloated&quot;, &quot;having a fat day&quot;, and other guilty eating phrases associated with eating disorders &lt;ref&gt; Bluhm, J. (2012, January 1). Seventeen Magazine Gives Girls Images of Real Girls!. Change.org. Retrieved May 2, 2014, from https://www.change.org/petitions/seventeen-magazine-give-girls-images-of-real-girls&lt;/ref&gt;.  But it was not just her ballerina friends talking negatively about their own body images, her peers at school were having similar conversations. 

Julia got involved with the [http://www.sparksummit.com SPARK (Sexualization, Protest: Action, Resistance, Knowledge) Movement] when she was in 8th grade, and her interest in media treatment of women and feminist activism increased. SPARK Movement's mission is to train girls and young women ages 13 to 22 about effective activism and how to separate healthy sexuality and sexualization of women in the media. This grassroots group has many partners, including [http://www.hghw.org/content/research Hardy Girls Healthy Women], which Julia sits on the girls advisory board &lt;ref&gt;The SPARKteam | SPARK Movement. (n.d.). SPARK Movement RSS. Retrieved May 2, 2014, from http://www.sparksummit.com/sparkteam/&lt;/ref&gt;.

Julia's connection with SPARK Movement &quot;sparked&quot; her engine to do something about the negative attitude at her school which she felt stemmed from presentation of teens in magazines and on television. In the spring of 2012, Julia Bluhm decided that Photoshop in teen magazines needed to be reduced. Julia Bluhm, with backing from the [http://www.sparksummit.com/ SPARK Movement], posted a petition, tiled [http://www.change.org/petitions/seventeen-magazine-give-girls-images-of-real-girls &quot;Seventeen Magazine: Give Girls Images of Real Girls,&quot;] on [http://www.change.org/ Change.org], asking that [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_%28Magazine%29 Seventeen Magazine] print at least one spread per issue without Photoshop.

By May 2012, Julia's petition had about 84,000 signatures and she felt it was time to present the results to Seventeen Magazine in person. She hosted a [http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1071384!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_635/image.jpg fake photo-shoot] outside of Seventeen Magazine's headquarters in New York &lt;ref&gt;Gregoire, C. (2012, July 5). Julia Bluhm, 14, Leads Successful Petition For Seventeen Magazine To Portray Girls Truthfully. The Huffington Post. Retrieved May 2, 2014, from http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/05/julia-bluhm-seventeen-mag_n_1650938.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Julia and her fellow protesters held signs with slogans such as, &quot;A magazine for me? Make it look like me&quot; yet again reminding the crowd that she is taking a stance against deception through photo manipulation. She received an [http://www.sparksummit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/julia-interview-224x300.jpg overwhelming response] from the media, and finally [http://i.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/julia-bluhm-ann-shoket-seventeen-magazine-petition__oPt.jpg met with the editor-in-chief] of Seventeen Magazine, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Shoket Ann Shoket].

Ann Shoket first responded defensively, releasing a press statement that Seventeen Magazine does not &quot;alter girl's body and face shape&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Botelho, G., &amp; Abbey, M. (1970, January 1). Seventeen magazine vows not to alter images, to 'celebrate every kind of beauty'. CNN. Retrieved May 2, 2014, from http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/05/us/seventeen-photoshopping/&lt;/ref&gt;.  But in August 2012, she solidified her statement by printing a full spread &quot;[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/07/04/business/Seventeen/Seventeen-blog480.jpg Body Peace Treaty]&quot; with all of the editors signatures. In the issue, Seventeen Magazine promised to &quot;never change girls' body and face shapes&quot;, &quot;always feature real girls who are healthy&quot;, and &quot;celebrate every kind of beauty&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Shoket, A. (2012, August 1). Seventeen Magazine's Body Peace Treaty. Seventeen.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Although they did not promise to remove photo-manipulation completely from their magazine, they showed an example edit in the spread and promised to post all pre-edited photos on their tumblr, &quot;[http://seventeen.tumblr.com/ Behind the Scenes at Seventeen!]&quot;

==Julia Bluhm and Professionalism==
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman Richard Feynman] is another person who used his voice and position in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Commission_Report Rogers Commission Report] to address issues he had seen in the culture around him.  Although Julia Bluhm's task may seem trivial in comparison Feynman addressing the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster Challenger disaster], she took a stance and instead of backing down, made sure that at least 86,000 girls and their parents became more aware of the impact photo editing has on adolescent girls.  Her goal was to bring to light media pressures that lead to an unhealthy social culture in America.  Julia Bluhm is a professional because she did not sit on her laurels, like Dan Applegate, and allow what she thought was a failure to pass by uncontested.  She fought for what was right, even when it seemed like impossible odds that would mark her different among her friends.

==Photography, Truth, and Ethics==
Historically, photography was the first way to record reality more truthfully than any other art form.  People therefore developed a mental model that photography represents truth.  As Ludwig Wittgenstein said, &quot;a picture is a fact&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig.  (1922).  Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.  Logisch-philosophische Abhandlung.  Retrieved May 3, 2013 from http://people.umass.edu/phil335-klement-2/tlp/tlp-ebook.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;.  However, Tushnet contends that when people &quot;treat images as transparent&quot; they &quot;deny that interpretation is necessary, claiming both that the meaning of the image is so obvious that it admits of no serious debate and that the image is a mere representation of reality&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Tushnet, R.  (2012, January 1).  Worth a thousand words:  the images of copyright.  Retrieved May 3, 2014 from Virgo. &lt;/ref&gt;. Is it ethically permissible to edit something that people believe to be the truth, or is it the viewers' responsibility to recognize that photographs do not always depict reality?  

Photo-manipulation technology has advanced so much that it is undetectable. There is now talk of not allowing digital photos to be evidence in courts of law.  People cannot simply look at an image and know with certainty if it has been edited or not.  Levy-Sachs and Sullivan acknowledge the advantages of digital photography, but content that in order to rely on photographs as evidence, the legal community needs to become more aware &quot;of the characteristics of digital images that could make them less reliable as evidence than traditional photographs&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Levy-Sachs, R., Sullivan, M.  (2004, August).  Using Digital Photographs in the Courtroom - Considerations for Admissibility.  Retrieved May 3, 2014 from http://www.securitymanagement.com/archive/library/feature_August2004.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;.  Currently, there is protocol law enforcement must follow when handling digital evidence and regulations on the authentication of those digital images &lt;ref&gt; Cameron, S.  (2011, August). Digital Evidence.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation. Retrieved May 3, 2014, from http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/law-enforcement-bulletin/august-2011/digital-evidence &lt;/ref&gt;.  The 2004 ''Connecticut v. Swinton'' Supreme Court case provides the guidelines for utilizing enhanced photographic evidence-- there must be a computer expert's testimony about the software used, and the reliability of the procedures must be examined &lt;ref&gt; Flamm, S., Solomon, S.  (2004).  Admissibility of Digital Exhibits in Litigation.  Retrieved May 3, 2014 from http://www.evidencephotographers.com/documents/doar.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.      

Some photographers contend magazines are creating art and not news, so the goal of the photography shown there is not to display reality, but rather the photographer's artful interpretation of reality &lt;ref&gt;Lodriguss, J.  The Ethics of Digital Manipulation.  Catching the Light.  Retrieved April 6, 2014 from http://www.astropix.com/HTML/J_DIGIT/ETHICS.HTM &lt;/ref&gt;.   Photographers claim that if the photographer's goal is to represent reality, photo-manipulation can help them do this.  Sometimes the only way to reproduce a scene with a camera the way the human eye would have seen it is through photo-manipulation; for example, when red-eye is removed. Others cite cases where photo-manipulation has been used to create public blindness by being misleading or deceptive.  They show cases where Photoshop has been used to [http://terrifictop10.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/lenin-altered-photo.jpg remove people from photos after losing political favor], [http://weburbanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/mussolini-on-horseback.jpg to make leaders appear more powerful], or to [http://terrifictop10.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/bush-holding-book.jpg just make others look dumb].  Researchers question whether this misuse of photo-manipulation will effect the credibility of photojournalism and believe that the trend of altering photos will cause more scandals &lt;ref&gt;Ricchiardi, S.  (2007, Aug/Sep).  Distorted Picture.  American Journalism Review.  Retrieved May 3, 2014 from Virgo &lt;/ref&gt;.  

Can't the same techniques used to enhance images for court cases or create political blindness be used in magazines to distort viewers' perceptions of reality on a more social and psychological level?  The [https://nppa.org/ National Press Photographers Association], whose goal is to promote integrity in visual journalism declares no photo should deceive the public no matter the source or audience &lt;ref&gt;National Press Photographers Association.  The Voice of Visual Journalists.  Retrieved May 3, 2014 from https://nppa.org/page/5167 &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Conclusion==
As demonstrated with both the Julia Bluhm case and examples from history, photo-manipulation in magazines can deceive the public.  It is the public's responsibility to determine if Photoshop in the media is a misuse of technology.  Julia Bluhm teaches others that no matter the how high-reaching or trivial their goal may seem, professionals need to voice their judgements to create change and awareness. Consumers should not be forced to change their ethics as technology advances,  but they should be ready to assess whether some uses of photo-manipulation are ethical or not.  The line where the pursuit of aesthetics violates ethics needs to be defined.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{AM&amp;C-top}}
{{Trainz-stub|This is a planned topic, earmarked for future development}}
Trainz pre-compiled asset Libraries, *.JA files can be uploaded into the next generation Trainz in most cases, and with some limitations. In point of fact, cross loading assets sometimes runs afoul of a incompatibility of scripts in *.gs files when doing so, and correcting these issues can be vexing, as where what changed, and which asset needs which change to work with the newer more modern *.gs files is not always immediately obvious.
 
It takes a little sleuthing and trial and error, advice seeking on the forums, and is just a spot of bother when an older asset runs afoul of a new system. The problem is rarely serious, though it may block running a particular route for a few days whilst the matter is resolved. Normally, this sort of hidden fault will show as a faulty asset, normally with a KIND and Class message in the Content Manager.
* After loading JA's it is therefore a good idea to examine all the dependencies of the 'added on routes' and a screenful at a time, re-validate them (check for errors and warnings of that whole page). While little repetitive, even working through a major route and it's sessions is straight forward. This requires regular waiting and evaluation of messages, but the wait times are surprisingly brief, albeit they will give you time enough to read a page or two in the Trainz Manual between gos. We recommend new Trainzer's do exactly that. Early in your Trainz career, you can't read the manuals often enough. Old hands will likely busy themselves working on that new asset they've got cooking. Just master {{kp|ALT|TAB}} and {{kp|SHFT|ALT|TAB}} toggling back and forth between applications, and if you're blessed enough to have two or three {{TN|head}}s on your computer setup, run CM on one and use the other for whatever else needs done in the foreground process. Bumping the {{TOS|Tweaking process priorities|priority of CM}} during this process is beneficial to a speedier completion.
{{TTip|Remember - The new Trainzer is very unlikely to ever first discover a problem before a ten year veteran Trainzer! Use the informaton resource of the Auran forums!}}

To be continued from that start

This page contains all of the Topic 2 outcomes from the IB Biology HL syllabus. These outcomes are the same for students studying Biology Standard Level. Each heading number corresponds to the syllabus outcome reference number.

All outcomes with the command term ''state'' have been left without notes except where further detail is required.

= Topic 2: Cells =

== Cell theory ==

=== Outline the cell theory. ===


The cell theory states that: 

# All living organisms are composed of cells. Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms. 
# Cells are the smallest unit of life. 
# Cells come from preexisting cells and cannot be created from non-living material.  
=== Discuss the evidence for the cell theory. ===


*When viewed under a microscope, all living organisms are made of cells
*Cells taken from tissues can survive for some time.
*Smaller parts cannot survive (i.e. carry out the functions of life)

Test to prove cells come from pre-existing cells:
#Take two containers and put food in both of these
#Sterilize both of the containers so that all living organisms are killed
#Leave one of the containers open and seal the other closed
#In the open container mold will start to grow; in the container that was sealed no mold will be present.
#In the open container, cells are able to enter the container from the external environment and start to divide and grow. The seal on the other container prevents entry of cells and so no mold will develop, proving that cells cannot arise from non-living material. 

=== State that unicellular organisms carry out all the functions of life. ===


=== Compare the relative sizes of molecules, cell membrane thickness, viruses, bacteria, organelles and cells, using the appropriate SI unit. ===
Remember:
*1 millimeter (mm) = 10-3 meters
*1 micrometer (μm) = 10-3 millimeters 
*1 nanometer (nm) = 10-3 micrometers

*A molecule = 1 nm
*Thickness of cell membrane = 10 nm
*Viruses = 100 nm
*Bacteria = 1μm
*Organelles = up to 10 μm
*Eukaryotic cells = up to 100 μm


=== Calculate the linear magnification of drawings and the actual size of specimens in images of known magnification. ===

#Take a measurement of the drawing (width or length).
#Take this same measurement (width or length) of the specimen.
#Remember to convert units if needed.
#Substitute your values into the equation below.

&lt;math&gt; Magnification = \frac {length\ of\ drawing} {length\ of\ actual\ specimen} &lt;/math&gt;

*Conversion of units:
*1 centimeter = 10-2 meters
*1 millimeter = 10-3 meters
*1 micrometer = 10-6 meters
*1 nanometer = 10-9 meters

=== Explain the importance of the surface area to volume ratio as a factor limiting cell size. ===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Header text !! 1 cm cube !! 3 cm cube !! 4 cm cube
|-
| Surface Area || 6 &lt;math&gt; cm^2 &lt;/math&gt; || 54 &lt;math&gt; cm^2 &lt;/math&gt; || 96 &lt;math&gt; cm^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Volume || 1 &lt;math&gt; cm^3 &lt;/math&gt; || 27 &lt;math&gt; cm^3 &lt;/math&gt; || 64 &lt;math&gt; cm^3 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Ratio || 6:1 || 2:1 || 1.5:1
|}

*Surface area of the cell is used for nutrient intake, temperature regulation, and waste excretion
*If there is more volume, more nutrients needed and more waste excreted. Also more volume needs regulated temperature.
*Rate of exchange for these materials is proportional to surface area; larger surface area = faster exchange of materials/heat


=== State that multicellular organisms show emergent properties. ===

*Multicellular organisms show emergent properties.
For example:
**cells form tissues
**tissues form organs
**organs form organ systems
**organ systems form multicellular organisms.


=== Explain that cells in multicellular organisms differentiate to carry out specialized functions by expressing some of their genes but not others. ===

*Each cell contains each of the genes of the organism.
*Activation of these genes varies from cell to cell.
*These differences in gene activation result in different cell types that carry out different functions.
*This is because genes encode for proteins, and proteins are related to structure, and structure is related to function.
*Keratin gene would be active in cells present in hair follicles
*These differences allow the cells in multicellular organisms to be more efficient than unicellular organismal cells.

=== State that stem cells retain the capacity to divide and have the ability to differentiate along different pathways. ===


=== Outline one therapeutic use of stem cells. ===

#At birth, cord blood containing stem cells are harvested from the umbilical cord.
#Can be used when needed. In leukemia, where the bone marrow cells divide uncontrollably, the cancerous bone marrow may be removed.
#The patient can then be given a transfusion of their cord blood containing hematopoietic stem cells.
#The stem cells will differentiate and divide to become the type of blood cell needed in bone marrow.

== Prokaryotic Cells ==

=== Draw and label a diagram of the ultrastructure of Escherichia coli (E. coli) as an example of a prokaryote. ===

=== Annotate the diagram from 2.2.1 with the functions of each named structure. ===


*Cell wall:
**Protects the cell from the outside environment and maintains the shape of the cell.
**Prevents the cell from bursting if internal pressure rises.

*Plasma membrane: Semi-permeable membrane that controls the substances moving into and out of the cell through either active or passive transport.

*Cytoplasm:
**Contains many enzymes used to catalyze chemical reactions of metabolism.
**Contains the DNA in a region called the nucleoid.
**Ribosomes are also found in the cytoplasm.
**Mostly water.

*Pili:
**Help bacteria adhere to each other for the exchange of genetic material.


*Flagella (singular flagellum):
**Made of a protein called flagellin.
**Helps bacteria move around by the use of a motor protein that spins the flagellum like a propeller.

*Ribosomes:
**They are the site of protein synthesis.
**Contributes to protein synthesis by translating messenger RNA.

*Nucleoid:
**Region containing naked DNA which stores the hereditary material (genetic information) that controls the cell and will be passed on to daughter cells.


=== Identify structures from 2.2.1 in electron micrographs of E. coli. ===
=== State that prokaryotic cells divide by binary fission. ===

Binary = two
Fission = splitting
Binary fission = reproduction by splitting into two

== Eukaryotic Cells ==

=== Draw and label a diagram of the ultrastructure of a liver cell as an example of an animal cell. ===

=== Annotate the diagram from 2.3.1 with the functions of each named structure. ===


*Ribosomes:
**Site of protein synthesis as they translate messenger RNA to produce proteins.
**Either floating free in the cytoplasm or attached to the surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and in mitochondria and chloroplast.
**Rough endoplasmic reticulum: Modifies proteins to alter their function and/or destination. Synthesizes proteins to be excreted from the cell.

*Lysosome:
**Membranous structure containing many digestive enzymes to hydrolyze macromolecules such as proteins and lipids into monomers.

*Golgi apparatus:
**Receives proteins on the cis side from the rough endoplasmic reticulum and may further modify them.
**It also packages proteins before the protein is sent to its final (intracellular or extracellular) destination from the trans side.

*Mitochondrion:
**site of aerobic respiration.
**Converts chemical energy from macromolecules into ATP using oxygen.

*Nucleus:
**Contains the chromosomes and therefore the hereditary material.
**It is responsible for controlling the cell through gene expression
**Control of cell: DNA → RNA → Protein → Structure → Function

Fixed regular shape due to cell wall.

=== Outline two roles of extracellular components. ===
Plant cell wall
maintains plant cell shape
allows high internal pressure
high pressure prevents excessive water uptake by osmosis
high pressure (turgor pressure) supports the plant
Animal cell glycoproteins
makes up the basement layer, a gel matrix
supports single layers of thin cells (capillaries)
used in cell to cell adhesion

=== Draw and label a diagram to show the structure of membranes. ===
=== Explain how the hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties of phospholipids help to maintain the structure of cell membranes. ===

Phospholipids have a hydrophobic fatty acid tail and a hydrophilic phosphate head.
Phospholipids form a double membrane in water with the hydrophilic head on the outside of the membrane, and the hydrophobic tails on the inside of the membrane.
This structure is found in cell membranes.
It is a fluid structure, and it is difficult to break, maintaining the structure of cell membranes.

=== List the functions of membrane proteins. ===
Hormone binding sites: allows one specific hormone to bind; once it binds, a signal is transmitted to the inside of the cell
Enzymes: enzymes in membranes catalyze reactions inside or outside the cell, depending on whether the active site is on the inside or outside of the cell
Electron carriers: arranged in chains so electrons can pass from one carrier to another; key in respiration and photosynthesis
Channels for passive transport: similar to a pore, allows larger molecules and polar molecules to pass through the membrane; each channel protein is specific to one substance


=== Define diffusion and osmosis. ===

Diffusion: the passive net movement of particles from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration, down the concentration gradient.
Osmosis: the passive movement of water from a region of low solute concentration to a region of high solute concentration, across a semi-permeable membrane


=== Explain passive transport across membranes by simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion. 
Membranes are semi-permeable; they allow certain molecules through but not others.
The molecules can enter/exit through passive transport, which requires no energy source other than a concentration gradient.
Molecules will go from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration (see 2.4.4).

*Simple diffusion
Some substances can diffuse through the phospholipid membrane.
Usually non-polar lipid-soluble molecules because membrane is hydrophobic (non-polar) inside
Water can enter and exit through osmosis (see 2.4.4)

*Facilitated diffusion
For substances unable to pass through the membrane (due to size, polarity, charge)
Channel proteins allow these substances to pass through
They are specific to one substance (e.g.: one type for glucose, one for Na+, etc)


=== Explain the role of protein pumps and ATP in active transport across membranes. ===
Active transport involves the movement of substances through the membrane using energy from ATP.
Advantage: substances can be moved against the concentration gradient
Cell membrane has protein pumps embedded it which are used in active transport to move substances across by using ATP.
Each protein pump only transports certain substances so the cell can control what comes in and what goes out.


=== Explain how vesicles are used to transport materials within a cell between the rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane. ===
After proteins have been synthesized by ribosomes they are transported to the rough endoplasmic reticulum where they can be modified. Vesicles carrying the protein then bud off the rough endoplasmic reticulum and are transported to the Golgi apparatus to be further modified. After this the vesicles carrying the protein bud off the Golgi apparatus and carry the protein to the plasma membrane. Here the vesicles fuse with the membrane expelling their content (the modified proteins) outside the cell. The membrane then goes back to its original state. This is a process called exocytosis. Endocytosis is a similar process which involves the pulling of the plasma membrane inwards so that the pinching off of a vesicle from the plasma membrane occurs and then this vesicle can carry its content anywhere in the cell.
=== Describe how the fluidity of the membrane allows it to change shape, break and re-form during endocytosis and exocytosis. ===
The phospholipids in the cell membrane are not solid but are in a fluid state allowing the membrane to change its shape and also vesicles to fuse with it. This means substances can enter the cell via endocytosis and exit the cell via exocytosis. The membrane then returns to its original state. In exocytosis the vesicles fuse with the membrane expelling their content outside the cell. The membrane then goes back to its original state. Endocytosis is a similar process which involves the pulling of the plasma membrane inwards so that a vesicle is pinched off it and then this vesicle can carry its content anywhere in the cell.
=== Outline the stages in the cell cycle, including interphase (G1, S, G2), mitosis and cytokinesis. ===
The first stage of cell division is interphase which is divided into 3 phases; G1, S and G2. The cell cycle starts with G1 (Gap phase 1) during which the cell grows larger. This is followed by phase S (synthesis) during which the genome is replicated. Finally, G2 (gap phase 2) is the second growth phase which separates the newly replicated genome and marks the end of interphase. 
The fourth stage is mitosis which is divided into prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. During mitosis the spindle fibers attach to the chromosomes and pull sister chromatids apart. This stage separates the two daughter genomes. Finally, cytokinesis is the last stage during which the cytoplasm divides to create two daughter cells. In animal cells the cell is pinched in two while plant cells form a plate between the dividing cells.
=== State that tumours (cancers) are the result of uncontrolled cell division and that these can occur in any organ or tissue. ===
=== State that interphase is an active period in the life of a cell when many metabolic reactions occur, including protein synthesis, DNA replication and an increase in the number of mitochondria and/or chloroplasts. ===
=== Describe the events that occur in the four phases of mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase). ===
Prophase:
the spindle microtubules grow and extend from each pole to the equator
chromosomes super coil and become short and bulky
nuclear envelope breaks down.
Metaphase:
chromatids move to the equator
spindle microtubules from each pole attach to each centromere (central part of chromosome) on opposite sides.
Anaphase:
spindle microtubules pull the sister chromatids apart splitting the centromeres, splitting the sister chromatids into chromosomes.
identical chromosome is pulled to opposite poles.
Telophase:
spindle microtubules break down
chromosomes uncoil and so are no longer individually visible
nuclear membrane reforms
cell divides by cytokinesis to form two daughter cells with identical genetic nuclei.


=== Explain how mitosis produces two genetically identical nuclei. ===
Mitosis is divided into four stages; prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. During prophase, the chromosomes become visible under a light microscope as they super coil and therefore they get shorter and more bulky. The nuclear envelope disintegrates and the spindle microtubules grow and extend from each pole to the equator. At metaphase the chromatids move to the equator. The sister chromatids are two DNA molecules formed by DNA replication and are therefore identical. These sister chromatids are then separated in anaphase as the spindle microtubules attaches to centromere and pulls the sister chromatids to opposite poles. As the sister chromatids separate they are called chromosomes. This means that each pole has the same chromosomes (same genetic material). Finally the microtubules break down, the chromosomes uncoil and the nuclear membrane reforms. The cell then divides into two daughter cells with genetically identical nuclei.

=== State that growth, embryonic development, tissue repair and asexual reproduction involve mitosis. ===</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Bronze Age ==

Before the Bronze Age, humans started to form the early steps to civilization. Most people lived in small tribes composed of multiple bands or lineages. Humans slowly started to abandon their nomadic lifestyles, and started creating permanent settlements. Most importantly, they started to develop crop farming and cultivation. The previous reliance on an essentially nomadic hunter-gatherer subsistence technique was increasingly replaced by a reliance upon the foods produced from cultivated lands. These developments lead to the growth of settlements, since the increased need to spend more time and labor in tending crop fields required more localized dwellings. This evolution of nomadic to agricultural life is known as the Neolithic Revolution, which was the lead in to the Bronze Age.

Writing emerged in many different cultures in the Bronze Age. Examples are the cuneiform writing of the Sumerians, Egyptian hieroglyphs, Cretan hieroglyphs, Chinese logographs, and the Olmec script of Mesoamerica. The Chinese script likely developed independently of the Middle Eastern scripts, around 1600 BC. The pre-Columbian Mesoamerican writing systems (including Olmec and Maya scripts) are also generally believed to have had independent origins. It is thought that the first true alphabetic writing was developed around 2000 BC for Semitic workers in the Sinai by giving mostly Egyptian hieratic glyphs Semitic values

Unquestionably, the Bronze Age can attest to the rise of the first civilizations. While the use of stone tools wasn't completely erased by the Bronze Age, their use was starting to be largely replaced by copper and bronze tools. The Bronze Age was the start of the heavy usage of metal and devolving trade routes, and many civilizations were linked by trade. Most of the early civilizations started around the banks of rivers. The soil surrounding rivers was moist and fertile, allowing crops to grow in areas that were arid and desert, like the Fertile Crescent of Mesopotamia, the Nile river valley of Egypt, and the Indus river valley in India. The small farming settlements of these rivers began to be able to grow a surplus of food from the excellent farming conditions. Now with out worry of trying to supply for just a small community, a surplus allowed more people to move in. As the number of inhabitants grew, they came to build cities, to create writing systems, to experiment in techniques for making pottery and using metals, to domesticate animals, and to develop complex social structures involving class systems. Bronze Age cultures differed in their development of the first writing. Cultures in Mesopotamia (cuneiform) and Egypt (hieroglyphs) developed the earliest viable writing systems. These early cultures will be our first stops in our tour of history, taking us to six of the earliest human civilizations, and others that also arose along the way.

== Ancient Near East ==

The ancient Near East was the home of early civilizations within a region roughly corresponding to the modern Middle East: Mesopotamia (modern Iraq, southeast Turkey, northeastern Syria and Kuwait), ancient Egypt, ancient Iran (Elam, Media, Parthia and Persia), Anatolia/Asia Minor (modern Turkey and Armenia), the Levant (modern Syria, Lebanon, Israel, State of Palestine and Jordan), Cyprus and the Arabian Peninsula. The ancient Near East is studied in the fields of Near Eastern archaeology and ancient history. It begins with the rise of Sumer in the 4th millennium BCE, though the date it ends varies: either covering the Bronze Age and the Iron Age in the region, until the conquest by the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BC or Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE.

The ancient Near East is considered the cradle of civilization. It was the first to practice intensive year-round agriculture, it gave the rest of the world the first writing system, invented the potter's wheel and then the vehicular- and mill wheel, created the first centralized governments, law codes and empires, as well as introducing social stratification, slavery and organized warfare, and it laid the foundation for the fields of astronomy and mathematics.

== Mesopotamia ==
In the narrow sense, Mesopotamia is the area between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, north or northwest of the bottleneck at Baghdad, in modern Iraq; it is Al-Jazīrah (“The Island”) of the Arabs. South of this lies Babylonia, named after the city of Babylon. However, in the broader sense, the name Mesopotamia has come to be used for the area bounded on the northeast by the Zagros Mountains and on the southwest by the edge of the Arabian Plateau and stretching from the Persian Gulf in the southeast to the spurs of the Anti-Taurus Mountains in the northwest. Only from the latitude of Baghdad do the Euphrates and Tigris truly become twin rivers, the rāfidān of the Arabs, which have constantly changed their courses over the millennia. The low-lying plain of the Kārūn River in Persia has always been closely related to Mesopotamia, but it is not considered part of Mesopotamia as it forms its own river system.

Mesopotamia, south of Ar-Ramādī (about 70 miles, or 110 kilometres, west of Baghdad) on the Euphrates and the bend of the Tigris below Sāmarrāʾ (about 70 miles north-northwest of Baghdad), is flat alluvial land. Between Baghdad and the mouth of the Shaṭṭ al-ʿArab (the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates, where it empties into the Persian Gulf) there is a difference in height of only about 100 feet (30 meters). As a result of the slow flow of the water, there are heavy deposits of silt, and the riverbeds are raised. Consequently, the rivers often overflow their banks (and may even change their course) when they are not protected by high dikes. In recent times they have been regulated above Baghdad by the use of escape channels with overflow reservoirs. The extreme south is a region of extensive marshes and reed swamps, hawrs, which, probably since early times, have served as an area of refuge for oppressed and displaced peoples. The supply of water is not regular; as a result of the high average temperatures and a very low annual rainfall, the ground of the plain of latitude 35° N is hard and dry and unsuitable for plant cultivation for at least eight months in the year. Consequently, agriculture without risk of crop failure, which seems to have begun in the higher rainfall zones and in the hilly borders of Mesopotamia in the 10th millennium BCE, began in Mesopotamia itself, the real heart of the civilization, only after artificial irrigation had been invented, bringing water to large stretches of territory through a widely branching network of canals. Since the ground is extremely fertile and, with irrigation and the necessary drainage, will produce in abundance, southern Mesopotamia became a land of plenty that could support a considerable population. The cultural superiority of north Mesopotamia, which may have lasted until about 4000 BCE, was finally overtaken by the south when the people there had responded to the challenge of their situation.

The present climatic conditions are fairly similar to those of 8,000 years ago. An English survey of ruined settlements in the area 30 miles around ancient Hatra (180 miles northwest of Baghdad) has shown that the southern limits of the zone in which agriculture is possible without artificial irrigation has remained unchanged since the first settlement of Al-Jazīrah.

The availability of raw materials is a historical factor of great importance, as is the dependence on those materials that had to be imported. In Mesopotamia, agricultural products and those from stock breeding, fisheries, date palm cultivation, and reed industries—in short, grain, vegetables, meat, leather, wool, horn, fish, dates, and reed and plant-fiber products—were available in plenty and could easily be produced in excess of home requirements to be exported. There are bitumen springs at Hīt (90 miles northwest of Baghdad) on the Euphrates (the Is of Herodotus). On the other hand, wood, stone, and metal were rare or even entirely absent. The date palm—virtually the national tree of Iraq—yields a wood suitable only for rough beams and not for finer work. Stone is mostly lacking in southern Mesopotamia, although limestone is quarried in the desert about 35 miles to the west and “Mosul marble” is found not far from the Tigris in its middle reaches. Metal can only be obtained in the mountains, and the same is true of precious and semiprecious stones. Consequently, southern Mesopotamia in particular was destined to be a land of trade from the start. Only rarely could “empires” extending over a wider area guarantee themselves imports by plundering or by subjecting neighboring regions.

The raw material that epitomizes Mesopotamian civilization is clay: in the almost exclusively mud-brick architecture and in the number and variety of clay figurines and pottery artifacts, Mesopotamia bears the stamp of clay as does no other civilization, and nowhere in the world but in Mesopotamia and the regions over which its influence was diffused was clay used as the vehicle for writing. Such phrases as cuneiform civilization, cuneiform literature, and cuneiform law can apply only where people had had the idea of using soft clay not only for bricks and jars and for the jar stoppers on which a seal could be impressed as a mark of ownership but also as the vehicle for impressed signs to which established meanings were assigned—an intellectual achievement that amounted to nothing less than the invention of writing.

Mesopotamia has had several cultures and civilizations take up its company through out its history, starting with Sumer. Along the way, some of the first empires arose, and Mesopotamia soon became one of the biggest centers of population in the Bronze Age.

== Sumer ==
No people has contributed more to the culture of mankind than the Sumerians. And yet, it is only comparatively recently that we have built up a knowledge of the existence of this ancient culture. Sumer was a civilization in  southern Mesopotamia that was most likely permanently settled between 5500 and 4000 BCE by non-Semitic people who could have spoke the Sumerian language. Like many early civilizations, Sumer was founded by agriculture on the banks of rivers, Euphrates and Tigris. Creating and maintaining irrigation canals for the frequent flooded rivers demanded a high amount of psychical labor. These intensive agriculture practices also demanded themselves a concentrated area of population in order to remain effective. A food supply is needed in order for a population to remain stable, which could have gave rise to permanent year-round urban settlement in the area of Sumer. However, much of Sumers' history has been lost forever to the sands of time. Only around 2500 BCE did a logographic system of writing come about, and only a handful of the clay tablets used to record said data have survived. For Sumerians, the clay writing tablets would quickly out live their usefulness after being sun hardened, as no more information could be written on them. Not worried about preservation of minor records, many clay writing tablets were used as scrap, thrown in with other scrap bits of clay and mud brick, and used as foundation leveling for buildings. In doing so, the passage of history has forever trapped the knowledge of the Sumerians in the realm of the unknown.

=== Life and Culture of Sumer ===

In the early Sumerian period, the primitive pictograms suggest that pottery was very plentiful, and the forms of the vases, bowls and dishes were manifold; there were special jars for honey, butter, oil and wine, which was probably made from dates, and one form of vase had a spout protruding from its side. Some of the vases had pointed feet, and stood on stands with crossed legs; others were flat-bottomed, and were set on square or rectangular frames of wood. The oil-jars - and probably others also - were sealed with clay, precisely as in early Egypt. Vases and dishes of stone were made in imitation of those of clay, and baskets were woven of reeds or formed of leather. A feathered head-dress was worn on the head. Beds, stools and chairs were used, with carved legs resembling those of an ox. There were fire-places and fire-altars, and apparently chimneys also. Knives, drills, wedges and an instrument which looks like a saw were all known, while spears, bows, arrows and daggers (but not swords) were employed in war. Tablets were used for writing purposes, and copper, gold and silver were worked by the smith. Daggers with metal blades and wooden handles were worn, and copper was hammered into plates, while necklaces or collars were made of gold. And, finally, time was reckoned in lunar months. 


There is considerable evidence that the Sumerians loved music, which seems to have been an important part of religious and civic life in Sumer. Instruments of Ancient Mesopotamia include harps, lyres, lutes, reed pipes, and drums. Many of these were shared with neighbouring cultures. The vocal tone or timbre was probably similar to the pungently nasal sound of the narrow-bore reed pipes, and most likely shared the contemporary &quot;typically&quot; Asian vocal quality and techniques, including little dynamic changes and more graces, shakes, mordents, glides and microtonal inflections. Singers probably expressed intense and withdrawn emotion, as if listening to themselves, as shown by the practice of cupping a hand to the ear (as is still current in modern Assyrian music and many Arab and folk musics). 


Though women were protected by late Sumerian law and were able to achieve a higher status in Sumer than in other contemporary civilizations, the culture was male-dominated. The Code of Ur-Nammu, the oldest such codification yet discovered, dating to the Ur-III &quot;Sumerian Renaissance&quot;, reveals a glimpse at societal structure in late Sumerian law. Beneath the lu-gal (&quot;great man&quot; or king), all members of society belonged to one of two basic strata: The &quot;lu&quot; or free person, and the slave (male, arad; female geme). The son of a lu was called a dumu-nita until he married. A woman (munus) went from being a daughter (dumu-mi), to a wife (dam), then if she outlived her husband, a widow (numasu) and she could then remarry.


Sumerian was the language of ancient Sumer. Sumerian is an agglutinative language, meaning that words could consist of a chain of more or less clearly distinguishable and separable affixes and/or morphemes.

Sumerian is a split ergative language. It behaves as a nominative–accusative language in the 1st and 2nd person of present-future tense/incompletive aspect (AKA marû-conjugation), but as ergative–absolutive in most other forms of the indicative mood. Similar patterns are found in a large number of unrelated split ergative languages (see more examples at split ergativity). In Sumerian the ergative case is marked by the suffix -e and the absolutive case (as in most ergative languages) by no suffix at all (the so-called &quot;zero suffix&quot;). Example of the ergative pattern: lugal-e e2 mu-un-du3 &quot;the king built the house&quot;; lugal ba-ĝen &quot;the king went&quot; (the transitive subject is expressed differently from the intransitive subject, as it takes the suffix -e). Example of the nominative–accusative pattern: i3-du-un (&lt; *i3-du-en) &quot;I go (away)&quot;; e2 ib2-du3-un (&lt; *ib2-du3-en) &quot;I build the house&quot; (the transitive subject is expressed in the same way as the intransitive subject, as both verbs take the same 1st person singular suffix -en).

Sumerian distinguishes the grammatical genders human/non-human (personal/impersonal), but it does not have separate male/female gender pronouns. The human gender includes not only humans but also gods and in some cases the word for &quot;statue&quot;. Sumerian has also been claimed to have two tenses (past and present-future), but these are currently described as completive and incompletive or perfective and imperfective aspects instead. There are a large number of cases: absolutive (-Ø), ergative (-e), genitive (-(a)k), dative/allative (&quot;to, for&quot;) (-r(a) for human nouns, -e for non-human nouns), locative (&quot;in, at&quot;) (-a, only with non-human nouns), comitative (-da), equative (&quot;as, like&quot;) (-gin), directive/adverbial (&quot;towards&quot;) (-š(e)), ablative (&quot;from&quot;) (-ta, only with non-human nouns). The naming and number of the cases varies in the scientific literature.

Another characteristic feature of Sumerian is the large number of homophones (words with the same sound structure but different meanings), which are perhaps pseudo-homophones, as there might have been differences in pronunciation such as tone or some phonemic distinctions that are unknown. The different homophones (or, more precisely, the different cuneiform signs that denote them) are marked with different numbers by convention, &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; being often replaced by acute accent and grave accent diacritics respectively. For example: du = &quot;go&quot;, du3 = dù = &quot;build&quot;.


Cuneiform script is one of the earliest known systems of writing, distinguished by its wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets, made by means of a blunt reed for a stylus. The name cuneiform itself simply means &quot;wedge shaped&quot;, from the Latin cuneus &quot;wedge&quot; and forma &quot;shape,&quot; and came into English usage &quot;probably from Old French cunéiforme.&quot; 


Sumerians believed in an anthropomorphic polytheism, or the belief in many gods in human form. There was no common set of gods; each city-state had its own patrons, temples, and priest-kings, however they were not exclusive. The gods of one city were often acknowledged elsewhere. Sumerian speakers were among the earliest people to record their beliefs in writing, and were a major inspiration later Mesopotamian mythology, religion, and astrology. These deities formed a core pantheon; there were additionally hundreds of minor ones. Sumerian gods could thus have associations with different cities, and their religious importance often waxed and waned with those cities' political power. The gods were said to have created human beings from clay for the purpose of serving them. The temples organized the mass labor projects needed for irrigation agriculture. Citizens had a labor duty to the temple, though they could avoid it by a payment of silver.


Sumerians believed that the universe consisted of a flat disk enclosed by a dome. The Sumerian afterlife involved a descent into a gloomy netherworld to spend eternity in a wretched existence as a Gidim (ghost).

The universe was divided into four quarters.

        To the north were the hill-dwelling Subartu who were periodically raided for slaves, timber, and raw materials.
        To the west were the tent-dwelling Martu, Semitic people living as pastoral nomads tending herds of sheep and goats.
        To the south was the land of Dilmun, a trading state associated with the land of the dead and the place of creation.
        To the east were the Elamites, a rival people with whom the Sumerians were frequently at war.

Their known world extended from The Upper Sea or Mediterranean coastline, to The Lower Sea, the Persian Gulf and the land of Meluhha (probably the Indus Valley) and Magan (Oman), famed for its copper ores.


Ziggurats (Sumerian temples) each had an individual name and consisted of a forecourt, with a central pond for purification.[37] The temple itself had a central nave with aisles along either side. Flanking the aisles would be rooms for the priests. At one end would stand the podium and a mudbrick table for animal and vegetable sacrifices. Granaries and storehouses were usually located near the temples. After a time the Sumerians began to place the temples on top of multi-layered square constructions built as a series of rising terraces, giving rise to the Ziggurat style.


It was believed that when people died, they would be confined to a gloomy world of Ereshkigal, whose realm was guarded by gateways with various monsters designed to prevent people entering or leaving. The dead were buried outside the city walls in graveyards where a small mound covered the corpse, along with offerings to monsters and a small amount of food. Human sacrifice was found in the death pits at the Ur royal cemetery where Queen Puabi was accompanied in death by her servants. It is also said that the Sumerians invented the first oboe-like instrument, and used them at royal funerals.


The Sumerians adopted an agricultural mode of life as by perhaps as early as c. 5000 - 4500 BCE the region demonstrated a number of core agricultural techniques, including organized irrigation, large-scale intensive cultivation of land, mono-cropping involving the use of plough agriculture, and the use of an agricultural specialized labour force under bureaucratic control. The necessity to manage temple accounts with this organization led to the development of writing. 

Sumerian agriculture depended heavily on irrigation. The irrigation was accomplished by the use of shaduf, canals, channels, dykes, weirs, and reservoirs. The frequent violent floods of the Tigris, and less so, of the Euphrates, meant that canals required frequent repair and continual removal of silt, and survey markers and boundary stones needed to be continually replaced. The government required individuals to work on the canals in a corvee, although the rich were able to exempt themselves.

The Sumerian Farmer's Almanac,  dated to around 1700 to 1500 BCE, is a cuneiform clay tablet  made by a farmer for his son. The document has prime importance in the history of agriculture and its techniques. The document consists of a series of instructions for the purpose of guiding one throughout their yearly agricultural activities. 

The instructions start with the flooding of the fields in the spring and ending with the cleaning and winnowing of the freshly harvested crops. The Sumer's soil was parched so irrigation was important. The almanac instructions began with advice concerning putting water into the fields and caring for the ground. The farmer was instructed to have his help prepare in advance all the necessary farming implements and tools. The farmer was instructed to make sure that he had an extra ox for the plow. The instructions were that before plowing, the farmer should have the ground broken up twice by the mattock and once by the hoe. The hammer was to be used to pulverize the clods. The farmer was instructioned to make sure he had a good manager to control the laborers to make sure they didn’t slough off.

The instructions from the Sumerian Farmer's Almanac were for the farmer to plow eight furrows to each strip of land, which was approximately 20 feet long. Plowing and sowing was carried on simultaneously. It was done with a seeder. A plow was used that had an attachment that carried the seed. A container dropped the seed through a narrow funnel down to even depths of just plowed furrows. The depth was to be that of the width of two fingers and if not the plow was to be adjusted to make it come out this way.

The furrows that had been plowed straight this year were to be plowed diagonal the next year and vice versa. The almanac gives instructions for the farmer to pray to Ninkilim, the goddess of field mice and vermin. This was so the pests would not harm the grain when it would start growing. There were special instructions on when to water the growing grain. There were three different watering times. If the farmer spotted reddening of the wet grain it was the dreaded samana-disease that endangered the crops. If the crop came out of this, then there was to be a fourth watering which usually yielded an extra ten percent.

When the farmer was to harvest the barley, he was not to wait, but was to harvest just at the right moment. This was when the barley stood tall and did not bend over under its own weight. Three men were to do the harvesting as a team using a reaper and a binder. The threshing was done by means of a sledge for a period of five days. This was a device drawn back and forth over the heaped-up grain stalks. The barley was then &quot;opened&quot; with an &quot;opener&quot;. A team of oxen drove this primitive machine to crush the barley-(sheaves). The barley, kernels and sheaves, were then winnowed-(of the sheaves) with pitchforks and laid on sticks to make clean.

The writer of the Sumerian Farmer's Almanac said that the agricultural instructions were not his, however those of the god Ninurta, the son and &quot;true farmer&quot; of the leading Sumerian deity, Enlil.



No architectural profession existed in Mesopotamia; however, scribes drafted and managed construction for the government, nobility, or royalty. The Mesopotamians regarded 'the craft of building' as a divine gift taught to men by the gods. The Tigris-Euphrates plain lacked minerals and trees. Sumerian structures were made of plano-convex mudbrick, not fixed with mortar or cement. Mud-brick buildings eventually deteriorate, so they were periodically destroyed, leveled, and rebuilt on the same spot. This constant rebuilding gradually raised the level of cities, which thus came to be elevated above the surrounding plain. The resultant hills, known as tells, are found throughout the ancient Near East. 

The Sumerians were the first society to create the city itself as a built form. They were proud of this achievement as attested in the Epic of Gilgamesh which opens with a description of Uruk, its walls, streets, markets, temples, and gardens. Uruk itself is significant as the center of an urban culture which both colonized and urbanized western Asia.

The construction of cities was the end product of trends which began in the Neolithic Revolution. The growth of the city was partly planned and partly organic. Planning is evident in the walls, high temple district, main canal with harbor, and main street. The finer structure of residential and commercial spaces is the reaction of economic forces to the spatial limits imposed by the planned areas resulting in an irregular design with regular features. Because the Sumerians recorded real estate transactions it is possible to reconstruct much of the urban growth pattern, density, property value, and other metrics from cuneiform text sources .

The typical city divided space into residential, mixed use, commercial, and civic spaces. The residential areas were grouped by profession. At the core of the city was a high temple complex always sited slightly off of the geographical center. This high temple usually predated the founding of the city and was the nucleus around which the urban form grew. The districts adjacent to gates had a special religious and economic function .

The city always included a belt of irrigated agricultural land including small hamlets. A network of roads and canals connected the city to this land. The transportation network was organized in three tiers: wide processional streets, public through street, and private blind alleys. The public streets that defined a block varied little over time while the blind-alleys were much more fluid. The current estimate is 10% of the city area was streets and 90% buildings. The canals; however, were more important than roads for transportation.

The materials used to build a Mesopotamian house were the same as those used today: mud brick, mud plaster and wooden doors, which were all naturally available around the city, although wood could not be naturally made very well during the particular time period described. Most houses had a square center room with other rooms attached to it, but a great variation in the size and materials used to build the houses suggest they were built by the inhabitants themselves. The smallest rooms may not have coincided with the poorest people; in fact, it could be that the poorest people built houses out of perishable materials such as reeds on the outside of the city, but there is very little direct evidence for this.


The Sumerians developed a complex system of metrology c. 4000 BCE. This metrology advanced resulting in the creation of arithmetic, geometry, and algebra. From c. 2600 BCE onwards, the Sumerians wrote multiplication tables on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period.  The period c. 2700 – 2300 BCE saw the first appearance of the abacus, and a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system. The Sumerians were the first to use a place value numeral system. There is also anecdotal evidence the Sumerians may have used a type of slide rule in astronomical calculations. They were the first to find the area of a triangle and the volume of a cube.


Discoveries of obsidian from far-away locations in Anatolia and lapis lazuli from Badakhshan in northeastern Afghanistan, beads from Dilmun (modern Bahrain), and several seals inscribed with the Indus Valley script suggest a remarkably wide-ranging network of ancient trade centered around the Persian Gulf. The Epic of Gilgamesh refers to trade with far lands for goods such as wood that were scarce in Mesopotamia. In particular, cedar from Lebanon was prized. The finding of resin in the tomb of Queen Puabi at Ur, indicates it was traded from as far away as Mozambique. The Sumerians used slaves, although they were not a major part of the economy. Slave women worked as weavers, pressers, millers, and porters. Sumerian potters decorated pots with cedar oil paints. The potters used a bow drill to produce the fire needed for baking the pottery. Sumerian masons and jewelers knew and made use of alabaster (calcite), ivory, iron, gold, silver, carnelian, and lapis lazuli.


The almost constant wars among the Sumerian city-states for 2000 years helped to develop the military technology and techniques of Sumer to a high level. The first war recorded in any detail was between Lagash and Umma in 2525 BCE on a stele called the Stele of the Vultures. It shows the king of Lagash leading a Sumerian army consisting mostly of infantry. The infantrymen carried spears, wore copper helmets and carried leather or wicker shields. The spearmen are shown arranged in what resembles the phalanx formation, which requires training and discipline; this implies that the Sumerians may have made use of professional soldiers.

The Sumerian military used carts harnessed to onagers. These early chariots functioned less effectively in combat than did later designs, and some have suggested that these chariots served primarily as transports, though the crew carried battle-axes and lances. The Sumerian chariot comprised a four or two-wheeled device manned by a crew of two and harnessed to four onagers. The cart was composed of a woven basket and the wheels had a solid three-piece design.

Sumerian cities were surrounded by defensive walls. The Sumerians engaged in siege warfare between their cities, but the mudbrick walls were able to deter some foes.


Examples of Sumerian technology include: the wheel, cuneiform, arithmetic and geometry, irrigation systems, Sumerian boats, lunisolar calendar, bronze, leather, saws, chisels, hammers, braces, bits, nails, pins, rings, hoes, axes, knives, lancepoints, arrowheads, swords, glue, daggers, waterskins, bags, harnesses, armor, quivers, war chariots, scabbards, boots, sandals, harpoons and beer. 


=== Early Sumerian History ===

By the late 4th millennium BCE, Sumer was divided into about a dozen independent city-states, which were divided by canals and boundary stones. Each was centered on a temple dedicated to the particular patron god or goddess of the city and ruled over by a priestly governor (ensi) or by a king (lugal) who was intimately tied to the city's religious rites.

The Sumerian king list is an ancient text in the Sumerian language listing kings of Sumer, including a few foreign dynasties. Some of the earlier dynasties may be mythical; the historical record does not open up before the first archaeologically attested ruler, Enmebaragesi (ca. 2600 BCE), while conjectures and interpretations of archaeological evidence can vary for earlier events. The best-known dynasty, that of Lagash, is omitted from the kinglist.


According to the Sumerian kinglist, Eridu was the first city in the World. The opening line reads,

            &quot;[nam]-lugal an-ta èd-dè-a-ba
            [eri]duki nam-lugal-la&quot;

            &quot;When kingship from heaven was lowered,
            the kingship was in Eridu.&quot;

Eridu (present day Abu Shahrein, Iraq) was considered the first city in the world by the Sumerians and, certainly, is one of the earliest recorded cities. Eridu was founded around 5400 BCE, and was believed by the Sumerians to have been created directly by the gods, as stated above in the kinglist. The future city-states of Mesopotamia looked back on Eridu as a golden-age metropolis. The city of Eridu features prominently in Sumerian mythology, not only as the first city and home of the gods, but as the locale to which the great goddess Innana traveled in order to receive the gifts of civilization which she then bestowed upon humanity from her home city of Uruk. The Eridu Genesis (composed c. 2300 BCE) is the earliest description of the Great Flood, pre-dating the biblical book of Genesis, and is the tale of the good man Utnapishtim (also known as Atrahasis or Ziusudra) who builds a great boat by the will of the gods and gathers inside 'the seed of life'. The Eridu Genesis may have been the first written record of a long oral tradition of a time around 2800 BCE when the Euphrates rose high above her banks and flooded the region.

The city was an important center for trade as well as religion and, at its height, was a great 'melting pot’ of cultures and diversity, as evidenced in the various forms of artistry found among the ruins. Eridu was abandoned intermittently over the years for reasons which remain unclear and, finally, left behind completely sometime around the year 600 BCE. The great Ziggurat of Amar-Sin in the center of the city has been associated with the Biblical Tower of Babel from The Book of Genesis and the city itself with the Biblical city of Babel. This association springs from archaeological discoveries (the claim that the Ziggurat of Amar-Sin more closely resembles the description of the Biblical Tower) and a reading of the Babylonian historian Berossus (c. 200 BCE) who seems to be clearly referring to Eridu when he writes of 'Babylon’. Today the ruins of Eridu are largely wind-swept sand dunes, and little remains to remind a visitor of the once mighty city which was founded by the gods.

After a flood occurred in Sumer, kingship is said to have resumed at Kish. The earliest Dynastic name on the list known from other legendary sources is Etana, whom it calls &quot;the shepherd, who ascended to heaven and consolidated all the foreign countries&quot;. Etana is estimated to have lived around 3000 BCE. Among the 11 kings who followed, a number of Semitic Akkadian names are recorded, suggesting that these people made up a sizable proportion of the population of this northern city. Afterwards, although its military and economic power was diminished, Kish retained a strong political and symbolic significance. Just as with Nippur to the south, control of Kish was a prime element in legitimizing dominance over the north of Mesopotamia (Assyria, Subartu). Because of the city's symbolic value, strong rulers later claimed the traditional title &quot;King of Kish&quot;, even if they were from Akkad, Ur, Assyria, Isin, Larsa or Babylon. One of the earliest to adopt this title upon subjecting Kish to his empire was King Mesannepada of Ur. A few governors of Kish for other powers in later times are also known. Kish continued to be occupied through the pre-Babylonian, old Babylonian, Kassite, and Neo-Assyrian Empire and Neo-Babylonian periods, and into classical Seleucid times, before being abandoned.

The dynasty of Lagash, though omitted from the king list, is well attested through several important monuments and many archaeological finds.

Although short-lived, one of the first empires known to history was that of Eannatum of Lagash, who annexed practically all of Sumer, including Kish, Uruk, Ur, and Larsa, and reduced to tribute the city-state of Umma, arch-rival of Lagash. In addition, his realm extended to parts of Elam and along the Persian Gulf. He seems to have used terror as a matter of policy—his Stele of the Vultures has been found, showing violent treatment of enemies. His empire collapsed shortly after his death. He is notable for the policy of having deliberately introduced the use of &quot;terror&quot; as a weapon against his enemies.

=== The Akkadian Empire ===

The Akkadian Empire was a Semitic empire centered in the city Akkad and its surrounding region in Mesopotamia which united all the indigenous Akkadian speaking Semites and the Sumerian speakers under one rule within a multilingual empire. During the 3rd millennium BCE, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerians and the Semitic Akkadians, which included widespread bilingualism. Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennia BCE (the exact dating being a matter of debate). The precise location of Akkad had been lost to the sands of time. Its possible it was in the area of Sumer, but possible other locations lay along, or east of the Tigris.

=== Life and Culture of the Akkadian Empire ===

The population of Akkad, like nearly all pre-modern states, was entirely dependent upon the agricultural systems of the region, which seem to have had two principal centers: the irrigated farmlands of southern Iraq that traditionally had a yield of 30 grains returned for each grain sown and the rain-fed agriculture of northern Iraq, known as the &quot;Upper Country.&quot;

Southern Iraq during Akkadian period seems to have been approaching its modern rainfall level of less than 20 mm (1 in) per year, with the result that agriculture was totally dependent upon irrigation. Before the Akkadian period the progressive salinisation of the soils, produced by poorly drained irrigation, had been reducing yields of wheat in the southern part of the country, leading to the conversion to more salt-tolerant barley growing. Urban populations there had peaked already by 2,600 BCE, and ecological pressures were high, contributing to the rise of militarism apparent immediately before the Akkadian period (as seen in the Stele of the Vultures of Eannatum). Warfare between city states had led to a population decline, from which Akkad provided a temporary respite. It was this high degree of agricultural productivity in the south that enabled the growth of the highest population densities in the world at this time, giving Akkad its military advantage.

The water table in this region was very high and replenished regularly—by winter storms in the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates from October to March and from snow-melt from March to July. Flood levels, that had been stable from about 3,000 to 2,600 BCE, had started falling, and by the Akkadian period were a half-meter to a meter lower than recorded previously. Even so, the flat country and weather uncertainties made flooding much more unpredictable than in the case of the Nile; serious deluges seem to have been a regular occurrence, requiring constant maintenance of irrigation ditches and drainage systems. Farmers were recruited into regiments for this work from August to October—a period of food shortage—under the control of city temple authorities, thus acting as a form of unemployment relief. 


The Akkadian government formed a &quot;classical standard&quot; with which all future Mesopotamian states compared themselves. Traditionally, the ensi was the highest functionary of the Sumerian city-states. In later traditions, one became an ensi by marrying the goddess Inanna, legitimising the rulership through divine consent.

Initially, the monarchical lugal was subordinate to the priestly ensi, and was appointed at times of troubles, but by later dynastic times, it was the lugal who had emerged as the preeminent role, having his own &quot;é&quot; or &quot;palace&quot;, independent from the temple establishment. By the time of Mesalim, whichever dynasty controlled the city of Kish was recognized as šar kiššati, and was considered preeminent in Sumer, possibly because this was where the two rivers approached, and whoever controlled Kish ultimately controlled the irrigation systems of the other cities downstream.

As Sargon extended his conquest from the &quot;Lower Sea&quot; (Persian Gulf), to the &quot;Upper Sea&quot; (Mediterranean), it was felt that he ruled &quot;the totality of the lands under heaven&quot;, or &quot;from sunrise to sunset&quot;, as contemporary texts put it. Under Sargon, the ensis generally retained their positions, but were seen more as provincial governors. The title šar kiššati became recognized as meaning &quot;lord of the universe&quot;. Sargon is even recorded as having organized naval expeditions to Dilmun (Bahrein) and Magan, amongst the first organized military naval expeditions in history. Whether he also did in the case of the Mediterranean with the kingdom of Kaptara (possibly Cyprus), as claimed in later documents, is more questionable.

With Naram-Sin, Sargon's grandson, this went further than with Sargon, with the king not only being called &quot;Lord of the Four Quarters (of the Earth)&quot;, but also elevated to the ranks of the dingir, with his own temple establishment. Previously a ruler could, like Gilgamesh, become divine after death but the Akkadian kings, from Naram-Sin onward, were considered gods on earth in their lifetimes. Their portraits showed them of larger size than mere mortals and at some distance from their retainers.

One strategy adopted by both Sargon and Naram-Sin, to maintain control of the country, was to install their daughters, Enheduanna and Emmenanna respectively, as high priestess to Sin, the Akkadian version of the Sumerian moon deity, Nanna, at Ur, in the extreme south of Sumer; to install sons as provincial ensi governors in strategic locations; and to marry their daughters to rulers of peripheral parts of the Empire (Urkesh and Marhashe). A well documented case of the latter is that of Naram-Sin's daughter Tar'am-Agade at Urkesh.


During the 3rd millennium BCE, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread bilingualism. The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium as a sprachbund. Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BCE (the exact dating being a matter of debate), but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century CE. 


Sumerian literature continued in rich development during the Akkadian period (a notable example being Enheduanna). Enheduanna, the &quot;wife of Nanna [the Sumerian moon god] and daughter of Sargon&quot; of the temple of Sin at Ur, who lived around 2285–2250 BCE, is the first poet in history whom we know by name. Her known works include hymns to the goddess Inanna, the Exaltation of Inanna and In-nin sa-gur-ra. A third work, the Temple Hymns, a collection of specific hymns, addresses the sacred temples and their occupants, the deity to whom they were consecrated. The works of this poetess are significant, because although they start out using the third person, they shift to the first person voice of the poet herself, and they mark a significant development in the use of cuneiform. As poetess, princess, and priestess, she was a personality who, set standards in all three of her roles for many succeeding centuries.


The empire was bound together by roads, along which there was a regular postal service. Clay seals that took the place of stamps bear the names of Sargon and his son. A cadastral survey seems also to have been instituted, and one of the documents relating to it states that a certain Uru-Malik, whose name appears to indicate his Canaanite origin, was governor of the land of the Amorites, or Amurru as the semi-nomadic people of Syria and Canaan were called in Akkadian. It is probable that the first collection of astronomical observations and terrestrial omens was made for a library established by Sargon. The earliest &quot;year names&quot;, whereby each year of a king's reign was named after a significant event performed by that king, date from the reign of Sargon the Great. Lists of these &quot;year names&quot; henceforth became a calendrical system used in most independent Mesopotamian city-states. In Assyria, however, years came to be named for the annual presiding limmu official appointed by the king, rather than for an event.

=== The Akkadian Empire's History ===

Speakers of the Akkadian language seem to have already been present in Mesopotamia at the dawn of the historical period, and soon achieved pre-eminence with the first Dynasty of Kish and numerous localities to the north of Sumer, where rulers with Akkadian names had already established themselves by the 3rd millennium BCE. The king Sargon has often been cited as the first ruler of a combined empire of Akkad and Sumer, although more recently discovered data suggests there had been Sumerian expansions under previous kings, including Lugal-Anne-Mundu of Adab, Eannatum of Lagash, and Lugal-Zage-Si.

Sargon of Akkad, defeated and captured Lugal-Zage-Si in the Battle of Uruk and conquered his empire. The earliest records in the Akkadian language date to the time of Sargon. Sargon was claimed to be the son of La'ibum or Itti-Bel, a humble gardener, and possibly a hierodule, or priestess to Ishtar or Inanna. One legend related of Sargon in Assyrian times says that


&quot;My mother was a changeling, my father I knew not. The brothers of my father loved the hills. My city is Azurpiranu (the wilderness herb  
fields), which is situated on the banks of the Euphrates. My changeling mother conceived me, in secret she bore me. She set me in a basket   of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid. She cast me into the river which rose not over me. The river bore me up and carried me to Akki, the drawer of water. Akki, the drawer of water, took me as his son and reared me. Akki the drawer of water, appointed me as his gardener. While I was gardener Ishtar granted me her love, and for four and (fifty?) ... years I exercised kingship.&quot;


Later claims on behalf of Sargon, that his mother was an &quot;entu&quot; priestess. The claims might have been made to ensure a descendancy of nobility, considering only a high placed family can be made such a position.

Originally a cupbearer to a king of Kish with a Semitic name, Ur-Zababa, Sargon thus became a gardener, responsible for the task of clearing out irrigation canals. This gave him access to a disciplined corps of workers, who also may have served as his first soldiers. Displacing Ur-Zababa, Sargon was crowned king, and he entered upon a career of foreign conquest. Four times he invaded Syria and Canaan, and he spent three years thoroughly subduing the countries of &quot;the west&quot; to unite them with Mesopotamia &quot;into a single empire.&quot;

However, Sargon took this process further, conquering many of the surrounding regions to create an empire that reached westward as far as the Mediterranean Sea and perhaps Cyprus; northward as far as the mountains (a later Hittite text asserts he fought the Hattian king Nurdaggal of Burushanda, well into Anatolia); eastward over Elam; and as far south as Magan — a region over which he reigned for purportedly 56 years, though only four &quot;year-names&quot; survive. He consolidated his dominion over his territories by replacing the earlier opposing rulers with noble citizens of Akkad, his native city where loyalty would thus be ensured. Trade extended from the silver mines of Anatolia to the lapis lazuli mines in Afghanistan, the cedars of Lebanon and the copper of Magan. This consolidation of the city-states of Sumer and Akkad reflected the growing economic and political power of Mesopotamia. The empire's breadbasket was the rain-fed agricultural system of northern Mesopotamia (Assyria) and a chain of fortresses was built to control the imperial wheat production.

Images of Sargon were erected on the shores of the Mediterranean, in token of his victories, and cities and palaces were built at home with the spoils of the conquered lands. Elam and the northern part of Mesopotamia were also subjugated, and rebellions in Sumer were put down. Contract tablets have been found dated in the years of the campaigns against Canaan and against Sarlak, king of Gutium. He also boasted of having subjugated the &quot;four quarters&quot; — the lands surrounding Akkad to the north, the south, the east and the west. Some of the earliest historiographic texts suggest he rebuilt the city of Babylon in its new location near Akkad.

Sargon, throughout his long life, showed special deference to the Sumerian deities, particularly Inanna, his patroness, and Zababa, the warrior god of Kish. He called himself &quot;The anointed priest of Anu&quot; and &quot;the great ensi of Enlil&quot; and his daughter, Enheduanna, was installed as priestess to Nanna at the temple in Ur.

Troubles multiplied toward the end of his reign. A later Babylonian text states;


&quot;In his old age, all the lands revolted against him, and they besieged him in Akkad &quot;...but &quot;he went forth to battle and defeated them, he 
knocked them over and destroyed their vast army&quot;.


It refers to his campaign in &quot;Elam&quot;, where he defeated a coalition army led by the King of Awan, where he forced the vanquished to become his vassals. Also shortly after, another revolt had been made;


&quot;the Subartu the upper country—in their turn attacked, but they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled their habitations, and he smote 

them grievously&quot;.


Sargon had crushed opposition even at old age. These difficulties broke out again in the reign of his sons, where revolts broke out during the 9-year reign, Rimush (2278–2270 BCE), who fought hard to retain the empire, and was successful until he was assassinated by some of his own courtiers. Rimush's elder brother, Manishtushu (2269–2255 BCE) succeeded and reigned for a period of 15 years. The latter king seems to have fought a sea battle against 32 kings who had gathered against him and took control over their country of what is today the United Arab Emirates and Oman. Despite the success, similarly to his brother, he seems to have been assassinated in a palace conspiracy.

Manishtushu's son and successor, Naram-Sin (2254–2218 BCE), due to vast military conquests, assumed the imperial title &quot;King Naram-Sin, king of the four quarters&quot;, the four quarters as a reference to the entire world. He was also for the first time in Sumerian culture, addressed as &quot;the god of Agade&quot;, in opposition to the previous religious belief that kings were only representatives of the people towards the gods. He also faced revolts at the start of his reign, But quickly crushed them.

Naram-Sin also recorded the Akkadian conquest of Ebla as well as Armanum and its king. Armanum location is debated, historian Adelheid Otto identify it with the Citadel of Bazi – Tall Banat complex on the Euphrates River between Ebla and Tell Brak, others like Wayne Horowitz identify it with Aleppo, and while most scholars place Armanum in Syria, Michael C. Astour believes it to be located north of the Hamrin Mountains in northern Iraq.

To better police Syria, he built a royal residence at Tell Brak, a crossroads at the heart of the Khabur River basin of the Jezirah. Naram-Sin campaigned against Magan which also revolted; Naram-Sin, &quot;marched against Magan and personally caught Mandannu, its king&quot;, where he instated garrisons to protect the main roads. The chief threat seemed to be coming from the northern Zagros Mountains, the Lulubis and the Gutians. A campaign against the Lullubi led to the carving of the famous &quot;Victory Stele of Naram-Suen&quot;, now in the Louvre. Hittite sources claim Naram-Sin of Akkad even ventured into Anatolia, battling the Hittite and Hurrian kings Pamba of Hatti, Zipani of Kanesh, and 15 others. This newfound Akkadian wealth may have been based upon benign climatic conditions, huge agricultural surpluses and the confiscation of the wealth of other peoples.

The economy was highly planned. Grain was cleaned, and rations of grain and oil were distributed in standardized vessels made by the city's potters. Taxes were paid in produce and labour on public walls, including city walls, temples, irrigation canals and waterways, producing huge agricultural surpluses.

=== The Akkadian Empire's Collapse ===

The Empire of Akkad collapsed in 2154 BCE, within 180 years of its founding, ushering in a Dark Age period of regional decline that lasted until the rise of the Third Dynasty of Ur in 2112 BCE. By the end of the reign of Naram-Sin's son, Shar-kali-sharri (2217–2193 BCE), the empire had weakened. There was a period of anarchy between 2192 BCE and 2168 BCE. Shu-Durul (2168–2154 BCE) appears to have restored some centralized authority, however he was unable to prevent the empire eventually collapsing outright from the invasion of barbarian peoples from the Zagros Mountains known as the Gutians.

Little is known about the Gutian period, or how long it endured. Cuneiform sources suggest that the Gutians' administration showed little concern for maintaining agriculture, written records, or public safety; they reputedly released all farm animals to roam about Mesopotamia freely, and soon brought about famine and rocketing grain prices. The decline coincided with severe drought, possibly connected with climatic changes reaching all across the area from Egypt to Greece. The Sumerian king Ur-Nammu (2112–2095 BCE) cleared the Gutians from Mesopotamia during his reign.

Eventually the Guti were overthrown by Utu-hengal of Uruk, and the various city-states again vied for power. Power over the area finally went to the city-state of Ur, when Ur-Nammu founded the Ur III Empire (2112–2004 BC) and conquered the Sumerian region. Under his son Shulgi, state control over industry reached a level never again seen in the region. Shulgi may have devised the Code of Ur-Nammu, one of the earliest known law codes (three centuries before the more famous Code of Hammurabi). Around 2000 BCE, the power of Ur waned, and the Amorites came to occupy much of the area, although it was Sumer's long-standing rivals to the east, the Elamites, who finally overthrew Ur. In the north, Assyria remained free of Amorite control until the very end of the 19th century BC. This marked the end of city-states ruling empires in Mesopotamia, and the end of Sumerian dominance, but the succeeding rulers adopted much of Sumerian civilization as their own.

=== Assyria ===

Assyria was a major Semitic kingdom, and often empire, existing as an independent state for a period of approximately nineteen centuries from c. 2500 BCE to 605 BCE, spanning the Early Bronze Age through to the late Iron Age. Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is positively known. The Assyrian King List mentions rulers going back to the 23rd and 22nd century BC. The earliest king named Tudiya, who was a contemporary of Ibrium of Ebla, appears to have lived in the mid-23rd century BCE, according to the king list.

The city of Ashur, together with a number of other Assyrian cities, seem to have been established by 2600 BCE, however it is likely that they were initially Sumerian dominated administrative centres. In c. the late 26th century BC, Eannatum of Lagash, then the dominant Sumerian ruler in Mesopotamia, mentions &quot;smiting Subartu&quot; (Subartu being the Sumerian name for Assyria). Similarly, in c. the early 25th century BC, Lugal-Anne-Mundu the king of the Sumerian state of Adab lists Subartu as paying tribute to him.

Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is positively known. In the Assyrian King List, the earliest king recorded was Tudiya. In initial archaeological reports from Ebla, it appeared that Tudiya's existence was confirmed with the discovery of a tablet where he concluded a treaty for the operation of a karum in Eblaite territory, with &quot;king&quot; Ibrium of Ebla (who is now known to have been the vizier of Ebla for king Ishar-Damu). This entire reading is now questionable, as several scholars have more recently argued that the treaty in question was not with king Tudiya of Asshur at all, but rather with the unnamed king of an uncertain location called &quot;Abarsal&quot;.

Tudiya was succeeded on the list by Adamu and then a further thirteen rulers (Yangi, Shuhlamu, Harharu, Mandaru, Imshu, Harshu, Didanu, Hanu, Zuabu, Nuabu, Abazu, Belu and Azarah). Nothing concrete is yet known about these names, although it has been noted that a Babylonian tablet listing the ancestral lineage of Hammurabi seems to include the same names from Tudiya through Nuabu in a heavily corrupted form.

The earliest kings, such as Tudiya, who are recorded as kings who lived in tents, may have been independent Akkadian semi-nomadic pastoralist rulers. These kings at some point became fully urbanised and founded the city state of Ashur.

During the Akkadian Empire (2334–2154 BCE) the Assyrians, like all the Akkadian Semites (and also the Sumerians), became subject to the dynasty of the city state of Akkad, centered in central Mesopotamia. The Akkadian Empire founded by Sargon the Great, claimed to encompass the surrounding &quot;four quarters&quot;. The region of Assyria, north of the seat of the empire in central Mesopotamia had also been known as Subartu by the Sumerians, and the name Azuhinum in Akkadian records also seems to refer to Assyria proper.

Assyrian rulers were subject to Sargon and his successors, and the city of Ashur became a regional administrative center of the Empire, implicated by the Nuzi tablets.

During this period, the Akkadian-speaking Semites of Mesopotamia came to rule an empire encompassing not only Mesopotamia itself but large swathes of Asia Minor, ancient Iran, Elam, the Arabian Peninsula, Canaan and Syria.

Assyria seems to have already been firmly involved in trade in Asia Minor by this time; the earliest known reference to Anatolian karums in Hatti, was found on later cuneiform tablets describing the early period of the Akkadian Empire (c. 2350 BCE). On those tablets, Akkadian traders in Burushanda implored the help of their ruler, Sargon the Great, and this appellation continued to exist throughout the Assyrian Empire for about 1,700 years. The name &quot;Hatti&quot; itself even appears in later accounts of his grandson, Naram-Sin, campaigning in Anatolia.

Assyrian and Akkadian traders spread the use of writing in the form of the Mesopotamian cuneiform script to Asia Minor and The Levant.

However, towards the end of the reign of Sargon the Great, the Assyrian faction rebelled against him; &quot;the tribes of Assyria of the upper country—in their turn attacked, but they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled their habitations, and he smote them grievously&quot;.

The Akkadian Empire was destroyed by economic decline and internal civil war, followed by attacks from barbarian Gutian people in 2154 BCE.

The rulers of Assyria during the period between c. 2154 BCE and 2112 BEC once again became fully independent, as the Gutians are only known to have administered southern Mesopotamia. However, the king list is the only information from Assyria for this period.

Most of Assyria briefly became part of the Neo-Sumerian Empire (or 3rd dynasty of Ur) founded in c. 2112 BCE. Sumerian domination extended as far as the city of Ashur, but appears not to have reached Nineveh and the far north of Assyria. One local ruler (shakkanakku) named Zāriqum (who does not appear on any Assyrian king list) is listed as paying tribute to Amar-Sin of Ur. Ashur's rulers appear to have remained largely under Sumerian domination until the mid-21st century BCE (c. 2050 BCE); the king list names Assyrian rulers for this period and several are known from other references to have also borne the title of shakkanakka or vassal governors for the neo-Sumerians.

The first written inscriptions by 'urbanised' Assyrian kings appear in the mid-21st century BEC, after they had shrugged off Sumerian domination. The land of Assyria as a whole then consisted of a number of city states and small Semitic Akkadian kingdoms, some of which were initially independent of Assyria. The foundation of the first major temple in the city of Ashur was traditionally ascribed to king Ushpia who reigned c. 2050 BC, possibly a contemporary of Ishbi-Erra of Isin and Naplanum of Larsa. He was reputedly succeeded by kings named Apiashal, Sulili, Kikkiya and Akiya (died c. 2026 BCE), of whom little is known, apart from much later mentions of Kikkiya conducting fortifications on the city walls, and building work on temples in Ashur.

The main rivals, neighbors or trading partners to early Assyrian kings during the 22nd, 21st and 20th centuries BCE would have been the Hattians and Hurrians to the north in Asia Minor, the Gutians and Turukku to the east in the Zagros Mountains of northwest Iran, the Elamites to the southeast in what is now south central Iran, the Amorites to the west in what is today Syria, and their fellow Sumero-Akkadian city-states of southern Mesopotamia such as Isin, Kish, Ur and Larsa.

Like many city-states in Mesopotamian history, Ashur was, to a great extent, an oligarchy rather than a monarchy. Authority was considered to lie with &quot;the City&quot;, and the polity had three main centres of power — an assembly of elders, a hereditary ruler, and an eponym. The ruler presided over the assembly and carried out its decisions. He was not referred to with the usual Akkadian term for &quot;king&quot;, šarrum; that was instead reserved for the city's patron deity Assur, of whom the ruler was the high priest. The ruler himself was only designated as &quot;the steward of Assur&quot; (iššiak Assur), where the term for steward is a borrowing from Sumerian ensi(k). The third centre of power was the eponym (limmum), who gave the year his name, similarly to the later archons and consuls of Classical Antiquity. He was annually elected by lot and was responsible for the economic administration of the city, which included the power to detain people and confiscate property. The institution of the eponym as well as the formula iššiak Assur lingered on as ceremonial vestiges of this early system throughout the history of the Assyrian monarchy.

In approximately 2025 BCE (long chronology), Puzur-Ashur I (perhaps a contemporary of Shu-ilishu of Larsa and Samium of Isin) is speculated (on the basis of his name being Akkadian rather than Hurrian) to have overthrown Kikkiya and founded a new dynasty which was to survive for 216 years. His descendants left inscriptions mentioning him regarding the building of temples to gods such as Ashur, Adad and Ishtar in Assyria. The length of his reign is unknown.

Shalim-ahum (died c. 2009 BCE) succeeded the throne at a currently unknown date. He left inscriptions in archaic Old Assyrian regarding the construction of a temple dedicated to the god Ashur, and the placement of beer vats within it.

Ilushuma(c. 2008–1975 BEC) took the throne in c. 2008 BCE, and is known from his inscription (extant in several copies) where he claims to have &quot;washed the copper&quot; and &quot;established liberty&quot; for the Akkadians in Sumerian city-states as far as the Persian Gulf. This was at first taken to imply that he made military campaigns into Southern Mesopotamia, however more recent scholarship has taken the view that the inscription means he supplied these areas with copper from Hatti, and that the word used for &quot;liberty&quot; (adduraru) is usually in the context of exemption from tariffs.

&quot;The freedom of the Akkadians and their children I established. I purified their copper. I established their freedom from the border of the marshes and Ur and Nippur, Awal, and Kish, Der of the goddess Ishtar, as far as the City of (Ashur).&quot;

Assyria had long held extensive contact with Hattian, Hittite and Hurrian cities on the Anatolian plateau in Asia Minor. The Assyrians who had for centuries traded in the region, and possibly ruled small areas bordering Assyria, now established significant colonies in Cappadocia, (e.g., at Kanesh (modern Kültepe) from 2008 BEC to 1740 BCE. These colonies, called karum, from the Akkadian word for 'port', were attached to Hattian cities in Anatolia, but physically separate, and had special tax status. They must have arisen from a long tradition of trade between Assyria and the Anatolian cities, but no archaeological or written records show this. The trade consisted of metals (copper or tin and perhaps iron; the terminology is not entirely clear) being traded for textiles from Assyria.

Erishum I(c. 1974–1935 BCE) vigorously expanded Assyrian colonies in Asia Minor during his long reign, the major ones appearing to be at Kanesh, Ḫattuša (Boğazköy) (the future capital of the Hittite Empire) and Amkuwa (Alisar Höyük), together with a further eighteen smaller colonies. He created some of the earliest examples of Written Law, conducted extensive building work in the form of fortifying the walls of major Assyrian cities and the erection of temples dedicated to Ashur and Ishtar. It is from his reign that the continuous limmum lists are known, however there are references to the eponym-books for his predecessors having been destroyed at some point.

Ikunum (c. 1934-1921 BCE)built a major temple for the god Ningal. He further strengthened the fortifications of the city of Assur and maintained Assyria's colonies in Asia Minor.

Sargon I (c. 1920-1881 BCE)succeeded him in c. 1920 BCE, and had an unusually long reign of 39 years. It is likely he was named after his illustrious predecessor Sargon of Akkad. He is known to have refortified the defences of major Assyrian cities, and maintained Assyrian colonies in Asia Minor during his reign. Apart from this, little has yet been unearthed about him. At some point he appears to have withdrawn Assyrian aid to southern Mesopotamia. It was during his reign in Assyria that the initially minor city-state of Babylon was founded in 1894 BCE by an Amorite Malka (prince) named Sumuabum.

Puzur-Ashur II (c. 1881-1873 BCE) came to the throne as an already older man due to his fathers long reign. Little is known about his rule, but it appears to have been uneventful.

Naram-Suen (c. 1872-1818 BCE) ascended to the throne in 1872 BCE, and is likely named after his predecessor Naram-Sin of the Akkadian Empire. Assyria continued to be wealthy during his 54 year long reign, and he defeated the future usurper king Shamshi-Adad I who attempted to take his throne.

Erishum II (c. 1818 - 1809 BCE) was to be the last king of the dynasty of Puzur-Ashur I, founded c. 2025 BCE. After only eight or nine years in power he was overthrown by Shamshi-Adad I, an Amorite usurper who claimed legitimacy by asserting descent from the 21st century BCE Assyrian king, Ushpia.

The Amorites were successfully repelled by the Assyrian kings of the 20th and 19th centuries BCE. However, in 1809 BCE the native Akkadian king of Assyria Erishum II was deposed, and the throne of Assyria was usurped by Shamshi-Adad I (1809 BCE – 1791 BCE) in the expansion of Semitic Amorite tribes from the Khabur River delta.

Although regarded as an Amorite by later Assyrian tradition, Shamshi-Adad's descent is suggested to be from the same line as the native Akkadian speaking ruler Ushpia in the Assyrian King List. He put his son Ishme-Dagan on the throne of a nearby Assyrian city, Ekallatum, and maintained Assyria's Anatolian colonies. Shamshi-Adad I then went on to conquer the kingdom of Mari (in modern Syria) on the Euphrates putting another of his sons, Yasmah-Adad on the throne there. Shamshi-Adad's Assyria now encompassed the whole of northern Mesopotamia and included territory in central Mesopotamia, Asia Minor and northern Syria. He himself resided in a new capital city founded in the Khabur valley in northern Mesopotamia, called Shubat-Enlil.

Ishme-Dagan(1790 - 1751 BCE) inherited Assyria, but Yasmah-Adad was overthrown by a new king called Zimrilim in Mari. The new king of Mari allied himself with the Amorite king Hammurabi of Babylon, who had made the recently created, and originally minor state of Babylon into a major power. It was from the reign of Hammurabi onwards that southern Mesopotamia came to be known as Babylonia.

Assyria now faced the rising power of Babylon in the south. Ishme-Dagan responded by making an alliance with the enemies of Babylon, and the power struggle continued without resolution for decades. Ishme-Dagan, like his father was a great warrior, and in addition to repelling Babylonian attacks, campaigned successfully against the Turukku and Lullubi of the Zagros Mountains (in modern Iran) who had attacked the Assyrian city of Ekallatum, and against Dadusha, king of Eshnunna, and the state of Iamhad (modern Aleppo).

Hammurabi, after first conquering Mari, Larsa, and Eshnunna, eventually prevailed over Ishme-Dagan's successor Mut-Ashkur, (1750 - 1740 BCE), and subjected him to Babylon c. 1750 BCE. With Hammurabi, the various karum colonies in Anatolia ceased trade activity — probably because the goods of Assyria were now being traded with the Babylonians. The Assyrian monarchy survived, however the three Amorite kings succeeding Ishme-Dagan, Mut-Ashkur (who was the son of Ishme-Dagan and married to a Hurrian queen), Rimush (1739 - 1733 BCE) and Asinum (1732 BCE), were vassals, dependent on the Babylonians during the reign of Hammurabi, and for a short time, of his successor Samsu-iluna.

The short lived Babylonian Empire quickly began to unravel upon the death of Hammurabi, and Babylonia lost control over Assyria during the reign of Hammurabi's successor Samsu-iluna (1750 - 1712 BCE). A period of civil war ensued after the deposition of the Amorite king of Assyria Asinum, (a grandson of Shamshi-Adad I) in approximately 1732 BCE by a powerful native Akkadian vice regent named Puzur-Sin, who regarded Asinum as both a foreigner and a former lackey of Babylon. A native king named Ashur-dugul seized the throne in 1732 BCE, probably with the help of Puzur-Sin. However, he was unable to retain control for long, and was soon deposed by a rival claimant, Ashur-apla-idi. Internal instability ensued with four further kings (Nasir-Sin, Sin-namir, Ipqi-Ishtar and Adad-salulu) all reigning in quick succession over a period of approximately six years between 1732 and 1727 BCE. Babylonia seems to have been too powerless to intervene or take advantage of this situation.

Finally, a king named Adasi (1726 - 1701 BEC) came to the fore c. 1726 BCE and managed to quell the civil unrest and stabilise the situation in Assyria. Adasi drove the Babylonians and Amorites from the Assyrian sphere of influence during his reign, and Babylonian power began to quickly wane in Mesopotamia as a whole, also losing the far south of Mesopotamia to the Sealand Dynasty, although the Amorites would retain control over a much reduced and weak Babylonia itself until 1595 BCE, when they were overthrown by the Kassites, a people from the Zagros Mountains who spoke a language isolate and were neither Semites nor Indo-Europeans.

Adasi was succeeded by Bel-bani (1700–1691 BC) who is credited in Assyrian annals with inflicting further defeats on the Babylonians and Amorites, and further strengthening and stabilising the kingdom.

Little is currently known of many of the kings that followed such as; Libaya (1690–1674 BCE), Sharma-Adad I (1673–1662 BCE), Iptar-Sin (1661–1650 BCE), Bazaya (1649–1622 BCE) (a contemporary of Peshgaldaramesh of the Sealand Dynasty), Lullaya (1621–1618 BCE) (who usurperped the throne from Bazaya), Shu-Ninua (1615–1602 BCE) and Sharma-Adad II (1601–1599 BCE). However, Assyria seems to have been a relatively strong and stable nation, existing undisturbed by its neighbours such as the Hatti, Hittites, Hurrians, Amorites, Babylonians, Elamites or Mitanni for well over 200 years.

Assyria appears to have remained strong and secure; when Babylon was sacked by the Hittites and subsequently fell to the Kassites in 1595 BCE, both powers were unable to make any inroads into Assyria, and there seems to have been no trouble between the first Kassite ruler of Babylon, Agum II, and Erishum III (1598–1586 BCE) of Assyria, and a mutually beneficial treaty was signed between the two rulers.

Shamshi-Adad II (1585–1580 BCE), Ishme-Dagan II (1579 - 1562 BCE) and Shamshi-Adad III (1562 - 1548 BCE) seem also to have had peaceful tenures, although few records have thus far been discovered about their reigns. Similarly, Ashur-nirari I (1547–1522 BCE) seems not to have been troubled by the newly founded Mitanni Empire in Asia Minor, the Hittite empire, or Babylon during his 25-year reign. He is known to have been an active king, improving the infrastructure, dedicating temples and conducting various building projects throughout the kingdom.

Puzur-Ashur III (1521–1498 BCE) proved to be a strong and energetic ruler. He undertook much rebuilding work in Assur, the city was refortified and the southern quarters incorporated into the main city defences. Temples to the moon god Sin (Nanna) and the sun god Shamash were erected during his reign. He signed a treaty with Burna-Buriash I the Kassite king of Babylon, defining the borders of the two nations in the late 16th century BC. He was succeeded by Enlil-nasir I (1497–1483 BCE) who appears to have had a peaceful an uneventful reign, as does his successor Nur-ili (1482–1471 BCE).

The son of Nur-ili, Ashur-shaduni (1470 BCE) was deposed by his uncle Ashur-rabi I (1470-1451 BCE) in his first year of rule. Little is known about his nineteen-year reign, but it appears to have been largely uneventful.

The emergence of the Mitanni Empire in the 16th century BCE did eventually lead to a period of sporadic Mitanni-Hurrian domination in the latter half of the 15th century. The Mitanni are thought to have conquered and formed the ruling class over the indigenous Hurrians. The Hurrians spoke a language isolate, i.e. neither Semitic nor Indo-European.

Ashur-nadin-ahhe I (1450-1431 BCE) was courted by the Egyptians, who were rivals of the Mitanni, and attempting to gain a foothold in the Near East. Amenhotep II sent him a tribute of gold to seal an alliance. It is likely that this alliance prompted Saushtatar, the Mitanni emperor, to invade Assyria, and sack the city of Ashur, after which Assyria became a sometime vassal state, with Ashur-nadin-ahhe I being forced to pay tribute to Saushtatar. He was deposed by his own brother Enlil-nasir II (1430-1425 BCE) in 1430 BCE, possibly with the aid of the Mitanni, who received tribute from the new king. Ashur-nirari II (1424-1418 BCE) had an uneventful reign, and appears to have also paid tribute to the Mitanni Empire.

The Assyrian monarchy survived, and the Mitanni influence appears to have been sporadic. They appear not to have been always willing or able to interfere in Assyrian internal and international affairs.

Ashur-bel-nisheshu (1417–1409 BCE) seems to have been largely independent of Mitanni influence, as evidenced by his signing a mutually beneficial treaty with Karaindash, the Kassite king of Babylonia in the late 15th century. He also undertook extensive rebuilding work in Ashur itself, and Assyria appears to have redeveloped a sophisticated financial system during his reign.

Ashur-rim-nisheshu (1408–1401 BCE) also undertook building work, strengthening the city walls of the capital, however it is likely that he paid tribute to Mitanni.

Ashur-nadin-ahhe II (1400–1393 BCE) also received a tribute of gold and diplomatic overtures from Egypt, possibly in an attempt to gain Assyrian support against Egypt's Mitanni and Hittite rivals in the region. However, the Assyrian king appears not to have been in a strong enough position to challenge the Mitanni.

Eriba-Adad I (1392-1366 BCE), a son of Ashur-bel-nisheshu, ascended the throne in 1392 BC and finally broke the ties to the Mitanni Empire.

There are dozens of Mesopotamian cuneiform texts from this period, with precise observations of solar and lunar eclipses, that have been used as 'anchors' in the various attempts to define the chronology of Babylonia and Assyria for the early 2nd millennium BC (i.e., the &quot;high&quot;, &quot;middle&quot;, and &quot;low&quot; chronologies.)


== Ancient Egypt ==

Ancient Egypt was an ancient civilization of Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations globally to arise independently. Egyptian civilization coalesced around 3150 BCE (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh. The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable Kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.

Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the New Kingdom, in the Ramesside period where it rivalled the Hittite Empire, Assyrian Empire and Mitanni Empire, after which it entered a period of slow decline.

The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley. The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and social development and culture. With resources to spare, the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent writing system, the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, and a military intended to defeat foreign enemies and assert Egyptian dominance. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes, religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a pharaoh, who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs.

The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying, surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids, temples, and obelisks; a system of mathematics, a practical and effective system of medicine, irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques, the first known ships, Egyptian faience and glass technology, new forms of literature, and the earliest known peace treaty, made with Hittites. Egypt left a lasting legacy. Its art and architecture were widely copied, and its antiquities carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for centuries. A new-found respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans and Egyptians led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.

=== Life and Culture of Ancient Egypt ===

Most ancient Egyptians were farmers tied to the land. Their dwellings were restricted to immediate family members, and were constructed of mud-brick designed to remain cool in the heat of the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread. Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats, while wooden stools, beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture.

The ancient Egyptians placed a great value on hygiene and appearance. Most bathed in the Nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; perfumes and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin. Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and both men and women of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and cosmetics. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the family's income.

Music and dance were popular entertainments for those who could afford them. Early instruments included flutes and harps, while instruments similar to trumpets, oboes, and pipes developed later and became popular. In the New Kingdom, the Egyptians played on bells, cymbals, tambourines, drums, and imported lutes and lyres from Asia. The sistrum was a rattle-like musical instrument that was especially important in religious ceremonies.

The ancient Egyptians enjoyed a variety of leisure activities, including games and music. Senet, a board game where pieces moved according to random chance, was particularly popular from the earliest times; another similar game was mehen, which had a circular gaming board. Juggling and ball games were popular with children, and wrestling is also documented in a tomb at Beni Hasan. The wealthy members of ancient Egyptian society enjoyed hunting and boating as well.

The excavation of the workers' village of Deir el-Madinah has resulted in one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of community life in the ancient world that spans almost four hundred years. There is no comparable site in which the organisation, social interactions, working and living conditions of a community were studied in such detail.

===== Cuisine =====

here are few precise accounts of how many meals were eaten, but it has been assumed that the wealthy would have two or three meals a day; a light morning meal, a larger lunch and dinner later in the evening. The general population would most likely eat a simple breakfast of bread, and a main meal with beer in the early afternoon.

Depictions of banquets can be found in paintings from both the Old Kingdom and New Kingdom. They usually started sometime in the afternoon. Men and women were separated unless they were married. Seating varied according to social status, with those of the highest status sitting on chairs, those slightly lower sat on stools and those lowest in rank sat on the bare floor. Before the food was served, handwashing basins were provided along with perfumes and cones of scented fat were lit to spread pleasant smells or to repel insects, depending on the type. Lily flowers and flower collars were handed out and professional dancers (primarily women) entertained, accompanied by musicians playing harps, lutes, drums, tambourines, and clappers. There were usually considerable amounts of alcohol and abundant quantities of foods; there were whole roast oxen, ducks, geese, pigeons, and at times fish. The dishes frequently consisted of stews served with great amounts of bread, fresh vegetables and fruit. For sweets there were cakes baked with dates and sweetened with honey. The goddess Hathor was often invoked during feasts. Food could be prepared by stewing, baking, boiling, grilling, frying, or roasting. Spices and herbs were added for flavor, though the former were expensive imports and therefore confined to the tables of the wealthy. Food such as meats was mostly preserved by salting, and dates and raisins could be dried for long-term storage. The staples bread and beer were usually prepared in the same locations, as the yeast used for bread was also used for brewing. The two were prepared either in special bakeries or, more often, at home, and any surplus would be sold.

The predynastic cuisine differed from later eating habits due to changes in climate. Egypt went from being a lush region to a drier climate. Initially, there was plenty of game such as antelope, gazelle, hippo, crocodile, ostrich, waterfowl, and fresh and saltwater fish. Smaller game like sheep, goats, cattle, and even hyenas were eaten. However, by dynastic times (around 3000 BCE) the availability of game had decreased considerably and was by then primarily a sport of the affluent, even though small game often would supplement the diet of the poor. The New Kingdom was a period with innovations in diet due to foreign trade and warfare. Pomegranates were introduced and almonds were imported. It is also possible that apples and apricots were imported on a small scale, and by Greco-Roman times quinces, pears, plums, peaches, filbert, walnut, pine nut, and pistachios were introduced.

Honey was the primary sweetener, but was rather expensive. There was honey collected from the wild, and honey from domesticated bees kept in pottery hives. A cheaper alternative would have been dates or carob. There was even a hieroglyph (nedjem/bener) depicting a carob pod that bore the primary meaning of &quot;sweet; pleasant.&quot; Oils would be made from lettuce or radish seed, safflower, ben, balanites and sesame. Animal fat was employed for cooking and jars used for storing it have been found in many settlements.

Egyptian bread was made almost exclusively from emmer wheat, which was more difficult to turn into flour than most other varieties of wheat. The chaff does not come off through threshing, but comes in spikelets that needed to be removed by moistening and pounding with a pestle to avoid crushing the grains inside. It was then dried in the sun, winnowed and sieved and finally milled on a saddle quern, which functioned by moving the grindstone back and forth, rather than with a rotating motion. The baking techniques varied over time. In the Old Kingdom, heavy pottery molds were filled with dough and then set in the embers to bake. During the Middle Kingdom tall cones were used on square hearths. In the New Kingdom a new type of a large open-topped clay oven, cylindrical in shape, was used, which was encased in thick mud bricks and mortar. Dough was then slapped on the heated inner wall and peeled off when done, similar to how a tandoor oven is used for flatbreads. Tombs from the New Kingdom show images of bread in many different shapes and sizes. Loaves shaped like human figures, fish, various animals and fans, all of varying dough texture. Flavorings used for bread included coriander seeds and dates, but it is not known if this was ever used by the poor.

Other than emmer, barley was grown to make bread and also used for making beer, and so were lily seeds and roots, and tiger nut. The grit from the quern stones used to grind the flour mixed in with bread was a major source of tooth decay due to the wear it produced on the enamel. For those who could afford there was also fine dessert bread and cakes baked from high-grade flour.

Along with bread, beer was a staple of the ancient Egyptians and was drunk daily. Like most modern African beers, but unlike European beer, it was very cloudy with plenty of solids and highly nutritious, quite reminiscent of gruel. It was an important source of protein, minerals and vitamins and was so valuable that beer jars were often used as a measurement of value and was used in medicine. Little is known about specific types of beer, but there is mention of, for example, sweet beer but without any specific details mentioned. Conical pottery from pre-dynastic times has been found at Hierakonpolis and Abydos with emmer wheat residue that shows signs of gentle heating from below. Though not conclusive evidence of early beer brewing it is an indication that this might have been what they were used for. Archeological evidence shows that beer was made by first baking &quot;beer bread&quot;, a type of well-leavened, lightly baked bread that did not kill the yeasts, which was then crumbled over a sieve, washed with water in a vat and then left to ferment. There are claims of dates or malts having been used, but the evidence is not concrete.

Microscopy of beer residue points to a different method of brewing where bread was not used as an ingredient. One batch of grain was sprouted, which produced enzymes. The next batch was cooked in water, dispersing the starch and then the two batches were mixed. The enzymes began to consume the starch to produce sugar. The resulting mixture was then sieved to remove chaff and yeast (and probably lactic acid) and was then added which began a fermentation process that produced alcohol. This method of brewing is still used in parts of non-industrialized Africa. Most beers were made of barley and only a few of emmer wheat, but so far no evidence of flavoring has been found.

Vegetables were eaten as a complement to the ubiquitous beer and bread, and the most common were long-shooted green scallions and garlic and both also had medical uses. There was also lettuce, celery (eaten raw or used to flavor stews), certain types of cucumber and, perhaps, some types of Old World gourds and even melons. By Greco-Roman times there were turnips, but it is not certain if they were available before that period. Various tubers of sedges, including papyrus were eaten raw, boiled, roasted or ground into flour and were rich in nutrients. Tiger nut (Cyperus esculentus) was used to make a dessert made from the dried and ground tubers mixed with honey. Lily and similar flowering aquatic plants could be eaten raw or turned into flour, and both root and stem were edible. A number of pulses and legumes such as peas, beans, lentils and chickpeas were vital sources of protein. The excavations of the workers' village at Giza have revealed pottery vessels imported from the Middle East, which were used to store and transport olive oil as early as the 4th Dynasty.

The most common fruit were dates and there were also figs, grapes (and raisins), dom palm nuts (eaten raw or steeped to make juice), certain species of Mimusops, and nabk berries (a species of the genus Ziziphus). Figs were so common because they were high in sugar and protein. The dates would either be dried/dehydrated or eaten fresh. Dates were sometimes even used to ferment wine and the poor would use them as sweeteners. Unlike vegetables, which were grown year round, fruit was more seasonal. Pomegranates and grapes would be brought into tombs of the deceased.

Meat came from domesticated animals, game and poultry. This possibly included partridge, quail, pigeon, ducks and geese. The chicken most likely arrived around the 5th to 4th century BCE, though no chicken bones have actually been found dating from before the Greco-Roman period. The most important animals were cattle, sheep, goats and pigs (previously thought to have been taboo to eat because the priests of Egypt referred pig to the evil god Seth). Beef was generally more expensive and would at most have been available once or twice a week, and then mostly for the royalty. However, excavations at the Giza worker's village have uncovered evidence of massive slaughter of beef, mutton and pork, such that researchers estimate that the workforce building the Great Pyramid were fed beef every day. Mutton and pork were more common. Poultry, both wild and domestic and fish were available to all but the most destitute. The alternative protein sources would rather have been legumes, eggs, cheese and the amino acids available in the tandem staples of bread and beer. Mice and hedgehogs were also eaten and a common way to cook the latter was to encase a hedgehog in clay and bake it. When the clay was then cracked open and removed, it took the prickly spikes with it.

===== Architecture =====

Due to the scarcity of wood, the two predominant building materials used in ancient Egypt were sun-baked mud brick and stone, mainly limestone, but also sandstone and granite in considerable quantities. From the Old Kingdom onward, stone was generally reserved for tombs and temples, while bricks were used even for royal palaces, fortresses, the walls of temple precincts and towns, and for subsidiary buildings in temple complexes. The core of the pyramids came from stone quarried in the area already while the limestone, now eroded away, that was used to face the pyramids came from the other side of the Nile River and had to be quarried, ferried across, and cut during the dry season before they could be pulled into place on the pyramid.

Ancient Egyptian houses were made out of mud collected from the Nile river. It was placed in molds and left to dry in the hot sun to harden for use in construction.

Many Egyptian towns have disappeared because they were situated near the cultivated area of the Nile Valley and were flooded as the river bed slowly rose during the millennia, or the mud bricks of which they were built were used by peasants as fertilizer. Others are inaccessible, new buildings having been erected on ancient ones. Fortunately, the dry, hot climate of Egypt preserved some mud brick structures. Examples include the village Deir al-Madinah, the Middle Kingdom town at Kahun, and the fortresses at Buhen and Mirgissa. Also, many temples and tombs have survived because they were built on high ground unaffected by the Nile flood and were constructed of stone.

Thus, our understanding of ancient Egyptian architecture is based mainly on religious monuments, massive structures characterized by thick, sloping walls with few openings, possibly echoing a method of construction used to obtain stability in mud walls. In a similar manner, the incised and flatly modeled surface adornment of the stone buildings may have derived from mud wall ornamentation. Although the use of the arch was developed during the fourth dynasty, all monumental buildings are post and lintel constructions, with flat roofs constructed of huge stone blocks supported by the external walls and the closely spaced columns.

Exterior and interior walls, as well as the columns and piers, were covered with hieroglyphic and pictorial frescoes and carvings painted in brilliant colors. Many motifs of Egyptian ornamentation are symbolic, such as the scarab, or sacred beetle, the solar disk, and the vulture. Other common motifs include palm leaves, the papyrus plant, and the buds and flowers of the lotus. Hieroglyphs were inscribed for decorative purposes as well as to record historic events or spells. In addition, these pictorial frescoes and carvings allow us to understand how the Ancient Egyptians lived, statuses, wars that were fought and their beliefs. This was especially true when exploring the tombs of Ancient Egyptian officials in recent years.

Ancient Egyptian temples were aligned with astronomically significant events, such as solstices and equinoxes, requiring precise measurements at the moment of the particular event. Measurements at the most significant temples may have been ceremonially undertaken by the Pharaoh himself.

===== Art =====

Much of the surviving art comes from tombs and monuments and thus there is an emphasis on life after death and the preservation of knowledge of the past. Symbolism also played an important role in establishing a sense of order. Symbolism, ranging from the pharaoh's regalia (symbolizing his power to maintain order) to the individual symbols of Egyptian gods and goddesses, is omnipresent in Egyptian art. Animals were usually also highly symbolic figures in Egyptian art. Colors were more expressive rather than natural: red skin implied hard working tanned youth, whereas yellow skin was used for women or middle-aged men who worked indoors; blue or gold indicated divinity because of its unnatural appearance and association with precious materials; the use of black for royal figures expressed the fertility of the Nile from which Egypt was born. Stereotypes were employed to indicate the geographical origins of foreigners

The Size the people are drawn indicates often relative importance in the social order. The king, or pharaoh, is usually the largest figure depicted to symbolize the ruler’s superhuman powers. Figures of high officials or tomb owner are usually smaller, and in smallest scale are shown servants and entertainers, animals, trees, and architectural details. 

Ancient Egyptian art forms are characterized by regularity and detailed depiction of gods, human beings, heroic battles, and nature, and a high proportion of surviving works were intended to provide solace and utility to the deceased in the afterlife. Artists endeavored to preserve everything from the present as clearly and permanently as possible. Ancient Egyptian art was created using media ranging from papyrus drawings to pictographs (hieroglyphics) and include funerary sculpture carved in relief and in the round from sandstone, quartz diorite and granite. Ancient Egyptian art displays an extraordinarily vivid representation of the Ancient Egyptian's socioeconomic status and belief systems. Egyptian art in all forms obeyed one law: the mode of representing Pharaohs, gods, man, nature and the environment remained consistent for thousands of years.

All Egyptian reliefs were not painted, and less prestigious works in tombs, temples and palaces were just painted on a flat surface. Stone surfaces were prepared by whitewash, or if rough, a layer of coarse mud plaster, with a smoother gesso layer above; some finer limestones could take paint directly. Pigments were mostly mineral, chosen to withstand strong sunlight without fading. The binding medium used in painting remains unclear: egg tempera and various gums and resins have been suggested. It is clear that true fresco, painted into a thin layer of wet plaster, was not used. Instead the paint was applied to dried plaster, in what is called &quot;fresco a secco&quot; in Italian. After painting, a varnish or resin was usually applied as a protective coating, and many paintings with some exposure to the elements have survived remarkably well, although those on fully exposed walls rarely have.[3] Small objects including wooden statuettes were often painted using similar techniques.

Many ancient Egyptian paintings have survived due to Egypt's extremely dry climate. The paintings were often made with the intent of making a pleasant afterlife for the deceased. The themes included journey through the afterworld or protective deities introducing the deceased to the gods of the underworld (such as Osiris). Some tomb paintings show activities that the deceased were involved in when they were alive and wished to carry on doing for eternity. Egyptian paintings are painted in such a way to show a profile view and a side view of the animal or person.

The monumental sculpture of Ancient Egypt is world-famous, but refined and delicate small works exist in much greater numbers. The Egyptians used the distinctive technique of sunk relief, which is well suited to very bright sunlight. The main figures in reliefs adhere to the same figure convention as in painting, with parted legs (where not seated) and head shown from the side, but the torso from the front, and a standard set of proportions making up the figure, using 18 &quot;fists&quot; to go from the ground to the hair-line on the forehead.

Ancient Egyptians used steatite (some varieties were called soapstone) and carved small pieces of vases, amulets, images of deities, of animals and several other objects. Ancient Egyptian artists also discovered the art of covering pottery with enamel. Covering by enamel was also applied to some stone works.

Different types of pottery items were deposited in tombs of the dead. Some such pottery items represented interior parts of the body, like the lungs, the liver and smaller intestines, which were removed before embalming. A large number of smaller objects in enamel pottery were also deposited with the dead. It was customary to craft on the walls of the tombs cones of pottery, about six to ten inches tall, on which were engraved or impressed legends relating to the dead occupants of the tombs. These cones usually contained the names of the deceased, their titles, offices which they held, and some expressions appropriate to funeral purposes.

Papyrus was used by ancient Egyptians (and exported to much of the ancient Mediterranean world) for writing and painting. Papyrus is relatively fragile, lasting at most a century or two in a library, and though used all over the classical world has only survived when buried in the very dry conditions of Egypt, and even then is often in poor condition. Papyrus texts illustrate all dimensions of ancient Egyptian life and include literary, religious, historical and administrative documents.</text>

== Abstract ==
This chapter aims to introduce the concepts and some basic properties of Shannon’s information measure - entropy, mutual information, and relative entropy. Inequalities involving these concepts will be introduced, too, to help reinforce readers’ understanding and enlarge their toolbox for future learning.

== Introduction ==
To undertand network coding, one need background knowledge in information theory. Among the essential concepts of information theory, a fundamental one is Shannon’s information measure - '''entropy''', '''mutual information''' and '''relative entropy'''. Instead of considering semantic aspects of information&lt;ref name=&quot;cesbell&quot;&gt;C. E. Shannon, &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication,&quot; The Bell System Technical Journal, vol. 27, no. July, October, pp. 379–423, 623–656, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;, the entropy measures the uncertainty of the outcome of a discrete random variable. Mutual information, as its name suggests, is how much information one d.r.v. contains about the other, or how much uncertainty one d.r.v. 'kills' for the other. Then we come to relative entropy, which can be seen as a generalization of mutual information. It measures the 'distance' between two d.r.v.s' probability distribution. After the three basic concepts are delivered, we introduce the inequalities that further characterize the properties of the information measures. 

To characterize '''uncertainty''', consider a coin flip. If the coin is not fair, say, the head has a 0.8 chance to turn up, while the tail only has a 0.2 chance. Then your uncertainty is low because you are quite certain that the head will turn up. However, if it is a fair coin, you will be more uncertain because the head and tail are equally likely to turn up. So if you were to use a mathematical expression to characterize the uncertainty of an outcome, this expression should be of the form of expectation, and reach its maximum when all choices are equally likely. Moreover, if we use dice instead of coin, or roulette instead of dice, then the uncertainty should grow as the number of choices grow. That is, the expression characterizing it should be increasing with the number of choices, i.e. the size of the alphabet. Lastly, if you roll two dices at once, the uncertainty of '3' and '4' turn up should be the same as that of rolling one dice then the other. So if sequential choices yield the same outcome as a single one, then the expressions of these choices should be able to combine and the combined result should be equal to that of the single choice. The three intuitive properties described above serves as criteria for choosing such expression.

== Definitions ==
'''Discrete Random Variable''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a discrete random variable with alphabet &lt;math&gt;??&lt;/math&gt; and PMF &lt;math&gt;P_X (x)=Pr(X = x),x \in X.&lt;/math&gt; Hereon, &lt;math&gt;P_X(x)&lt;/math&gt; is often written as &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; for convenience, and discrete random variable as d.r.v.

'''Entropy''' The entropy of a d.r.v. is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;H(X) = -\sum P(x)\log_b P(x)&lt;/math&gt;, in other words, the expectation of &lt;math&gt;log_b \frac{1}{P(x)}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Letter 'b' in the base specifies the unit of entropy. If b = 2, the unit is bit (binary unit, note the difference between this and the other 'bit' -- binary digit); b = e, it's nat (natural unit). Unless specified otherwise, we use bit. This form of expectation of negative logrithm is tailor-made by Shannon&lt;ref name=&quot;cesbell&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for the three criteria we described in the last section.

'''Joint Entropy''' We defined entropy of a single d.r.v., the definition of two d.r.v.s is immediate:

&lt;math&gt;H(X) = -\sum_{x, y \in S(X, Y)} P(x,y)\log P(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Conditional Entropy''' The entropy of a d.r.v. conditioning on another d.r.v. is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;H(X|Y = y) = -\sum_{x \in X} P(x|y)\log P(x|y)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now we can express the third criterion with conditional entropy: 

&lt;math&gt;H(XY) = H(X) + H(Y|X) = H(Y) + H(X|Y)&lt;/math&gt;. Rolling two dice at once or rolling one after the other should have the same uncertainty. And this can be extended to more than two d.r.v.s:

&lt;math&gt;H(X_1,X_2,...,X_N) = \sum_{n=1}^N H(X_N|X_1,X_2,...,X_{N-1})&lt;/math&gt;. This is called the '''chain rule of entropy'''.

'''Convex Function'''

PRINCE2 has seven '''principles''' of project management:
# continued business justification
# learn from experience
# define roles and responsibilities
# manage by stages
# manage by exception
# focus on products
# tailor to suit the project environment

And seven '''themes''':
# business case
# organization
# quality
# plans
# risk
# change
# progress

These principles and themes are encapsulated in the seven '''processes''' (which form the basis from which this book shall examine PRINCE2):

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background==

[[w: Andrew Wakefield|Andrew Wakefield]] is a former surgeon and medical researcher at the at the [[w: Royal Free Hospital|Royal Free hospital]] in London, England. In 1998, he published a highly controversial paper in [[w: The Lancet|''The Lancet'']] that suggested further research into a possible connection between the [[w: MMR vaccine|mumps, rubella, measles (MMR) vaccine]] and autism. In an effort to temper a potentially visceral public response to such a controversial claim, the Royal Free held a press conference in February with a balanced panel of proponents and skeptics of the research results. This panel of experts included Andrew Wakefield himself, who took the opportunity at the lectern to proclaim the MMR vaccine unsafe for children, far surpassing the conclusions of the paper. He urged parents to vaccinate their children with single-shot vaccine alternatives to MMR, effectively setting off what would later be known as the [[w: MMR vaccine controversy|MMR vaccine controversy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jeremy Laurance&quot;&gt;Laurance, J. (2010, January 29). I was there when Wakefield dropped his bombshell. The Independent. http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/i-was-there-when-wakefield-dropped-his-bombshell-1882548.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For years after his 1998 publication Wakefield fiercely defended his research from skeptics,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakefield's Rebuttal&quot;&gt;Wakefield, A. (1999, September 11). MMR vaccination and autism. The Lancet, 354(9182), 949-950. http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)75696-8/fulltext&lt;/ref&gt; and his reputation as a leader in the fight against &quot;Big Pharma&quot; grew. However, in 2004 information began to surface regarding conflicts of interest and fraudulent research practices in relation to Wakefield's original 1998 paper.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Deer Article&quot;&gt;Deer, B. (2004, February 22). MMR - The truth behind the crisis. The Sunday Times. http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-deer-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These findings led to deeper investigation that culminated in the revocation of Wakefield's UK medical license after the [[w: General Medical Council|General Medical Council]]'s longest &quot;Fitness to Practise&quot; trial in its history. Additionally, ''The Lancet'' announced its complete retraction of Wakefield's 1998 paper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancet Retraction Notice&quot;&gt;The Lancet (2010, February 6). &quot;Retraction—Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children&quot;. The Lancet 375(9713), 445. http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2810%2960175-4/fulltext#&lt;/ref&gt; All but two of Wakefield's co-authors also retracted their association with the paper in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Co-Author retraction&quot;&gt;Murch, S. H., Anthony, A., Casson, D. H., Malik, M., Berelowitz, M., Dhillon, A. P., Thomson, M. A., Valentine, A., Davies, S. E., Walker-Smith, J. A. (2004, March 6). Retraction of an interpretation. The Lancet, 363. http://www.thelancet.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Wakefield himself never changed his stance against the MMR vaccine, and to this day he maintains a large following among members of the anti-vaccine movement.

==Consequences of the MMR Vaccine Controversy==

The introduction of the MMR vaccine in the UK in 1988 was extremely successful, changing measles from a common and extremely infectious disease affecting up to 500,000&lt;ref name=&quot;Measles outbreak news&quot;&gt;The Guardian. (2013, April 9). Swansea measles epidemic: 620 cases confirmed. http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/apr/09/swansea-measles-epidemic-620-cases&lt;/ref&gt; people each year to something contained and rarely seen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Measles rare&quot;&gt;National Health Service. (2013, November 8). MMR vaccine. http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/mmr-vaccine.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Between November 2012 and July 2013, however, 1219 cases of measles were documented in the Swansea area of the UK. This epidemic was blamed on the extremely low vaccination rates in the area; between 1995 and 2003 the uptake of the MMR vaccine in Swansea dropped from 95 percent, the requirement for [[w: Herd immunity|herd immunity]] against measles, to just 67.5 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Measles UK Outbreak Stats&quot;&gt;Public Health Wales. (2013). Measles Outbreak: Data [Data set]. http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/888/page/66389&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Swansea measles uptake stats&quot;&gt;BBC News. (2013, July 10). Swansea measles epidemic: Worries over MMR uptake after outbreak. http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-23244628&lt;/ref&gt; This decline in the acceptance of the MMR vaccine is arguably due in part to the long-running anti-vaccination movement and Wakefield's fraudulent denouncement of the vaccine in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;Measles death, linked to Wakefield&quot;&gt;BBC News. (2006, 3 April). First measles death for 14 years. http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-23244628&lt;/ref&gt;

Measles, mumps, and rubella and may resurface in the future as Wakefield continues his anti-MMR stance.

==Participants==
In order to more fully examine the ethical structures involved, an analysis of each participant and his or her respective role is necessary. The major players in the controversy are listed below. Excluded is Wakefield, who is profiled above.

===Brian Deer===
[[File:Brian Deer.jpg|left|thumb|Brian Deer in 2010]]
[[w:Brian Deer|Brian Deer]] is an investigative journalist for [[w:The Sunday Times|''The Sunday Times'']] of London. His investigations, primarily in the field of medicine, have won him acclaim. One judge at the 1999 British Press Awards, where Deer was recognized as the Specialist Reporter of the Year, commented that Deer was probably &quot;the only journalist in Britain that polices the drug companies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deer 1999 Award&quot;&gt;The Sunday Times (March 28, 1999). The Best Writers. The Sunday Times:33(43), page 2. http://briandeer.com/awardclip.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Deer has been credited with bringing the Andrew Wakefield scandal to light through his meticulous work.&lt;ref name=&quot;BMJ editorial&quot;&gt;Godlee, F., Smith, J., &amp; Marcovitch, H. (2011) Wakefield’s article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent. British Medical Journal. 342:c7452. http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Health Risk and News&quot;&gt;Boyce, T. (2007). Health, Risk, and News. Peter Lang Publishing, Inc: New York, pages 10-11. http://books.google.com/books?id=2whS9tXKLn4C&lt;/ref&gt; His investigation began with a routine assignment at ''The Times'' in late 2003 and expanded to a full-fledged investigation after evidence of fraud came to light.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deer Investigation&quot;&gt;Deer, B. (2014) Brian Deer: the Lancet scandal. http://briandeer.com/mmr-lancet.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Deer interviewed parents of children discussed in the ''Lancet'' paper, reviewed medical histories, and examined Wakefield’s funding sources to construct a full picture of Wakefield’s work. In February 2004, he published the first in a series of articles exposing Wakefield’s scientific malfeasance.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Deer Article&quot; /&gt; This article, along with subsequent revelations by Deer, led to the retraction of Wakefield's co-authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Co-Author retraction&quot; /&gt; His investigative work in the Wakefield case continued for seven years and was a major contributing factor to Wakefield’s loss of medical license.

A 2004 libel suit by Wakefield presented an obstacle to Deer’s investigation, but it also allowed Deer to access confidential medical records as a part of court proceedings.&lt;ref name=&quot;court order documents&quot;&gt;Dyer, C. (2007). GMC must disclose files on Wakefield to documentary makers. British Medical Journal: 334(7583): 12–12-i. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1764094/&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence that he found within strengthened his case against Wakefield, who soon dropped the libel case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakefield drops libel case&quot;&gt;Dyer, C. (2007). Andrew Wakefield drops libel case against Channel 4. British Medical Journal: 334(7584): 60. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1767245/&lt;/ref&gt;

Deer received heavy criticism for his investigation of Wakefield. Many people viewed Wakefield as a hero for his anti-vaccine work and questioned Deer’s motives. Keith Olbermann listed Deer as one of his “Worst People of the Week” in a 2009 show,&lt;ref name=&quot;Olbermann&quot;&gt;NBC News. (February 12, 2009).  'Countdown with Keith Olbermann' for February 11, 2009. http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29160146/ns/msnbc-countdown_with_keith_olbermann/t/countdown-keith-olbermann-wednesday-february/#.U2kbE-ZdWAA&lt;/ref&gt; Wakefield himself publicly attacked Deer, calling him a “hitman” in a 2011 interview,&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson Cooper Interview&quot;&gt;CNN. (2011). Transcripts: Autism Study a Fraud. http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1101/06/cnr.02.html&lt;/ref&gt; and many independent websites branded him as a liar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deer liar&quot;&gt;Olmsted, D. &amp; Blaxill, M. (2009). A Character Assassin Caught in the Act. Age of Autism. http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/03/a-character-assassin-caught-in-the-act.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Deer’s perseverance paid off with an endorsement of his investigation by the British Medical Journal and a British Media Award for Outstanding Journalism in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Press Award 2&quot;&gt;The Press Awards. (2011). Specialist Journalist of the Year. http://www.pressawards.org.uk/page-view.php?pagename=Specialist-Journalist-of-the-Year&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard Horton===
[[File:Richard Horton.JPG|right|thumb|Richard Horton]]
[[w:Richard Horton (editor)|Richard Horton]] has served as the editor of ''The Lancet'' since 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancet-about&quot;&gt;The Lancet. (2014). About The Lancet medical journal. http://www.thelancet.com/lancet-about&lt;/ref&gt; As editor, he was ultimately responsible for the publication of Wakefield's 1998 paper. His response to ethical concerns surrounding Wakefield's work has been criticized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancet response&quot;&gt;Deer, B. (2011). The Lancet’s two days to bury bad news. British Medical Journal: 342:c7001. http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7001&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2004, Horton was briefed about the major ethical violations by Wakefield. Rather than independently investigating the claims, Horton took the word of Wakefield and his two primary co-authors and cleared their names. He publicly stated that he did &quot;...not judge that there was any intention to conceal information or deceive editors, reviewers, or readers about the ethical justification for this work and the nature of patient referral.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancet response&quot; /&gt; However, as the investigation by Brian Deer and the GMC proceeded, he changed his view: &quot;It was utterly clear, without any ambiguity at all, that the statements in the paper were utterly false.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Horton waffle&quot;&gt;Boseley, S. (February 2, 2010). Lancet retracts 'utterly false' MMR paper. The Guardian. http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/feb/02/lancet-retracts-mmr-paper&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard Barr===
From 1973-1998, Richard Barr was a solicitor for Dawbarns Solicitors in Norfolk (now Fraser Dawbarns Solicitors LLP). A self-proclaimed specialist in clinical negligence, he heavily pursued the link between MMR and autism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barr LinkedIn&quot;&gt; Barr, R. (n.d.) Profile [LinkedIn]. http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/richard-barr/17/262/992&lt;/ref&gt; This passion brought him to a parent-led organization called Justice, Awareness, and Basic Support (JABS). JABS became a voice for parents who believed that their children had contracted autism via MMR and, in addition to Barr, also boasted the membership of Andrew Wakefield in its early years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Health Risk and News&quot;&gt; Boyce, T. (2007). Health, Risk and News (p. 10-12). Peter Lang. http://books.google.com/books?id=2whS9tXKLn4C&amp;pgis=1. &lt;/ref&gt;  Barr used this organization to approach Wakefield about potential research on the issue, offering £150/hour plus expenses to pursue evidence for this case in February 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;Secrets of the MMR Scare&quot;&gt; Deer, B.

BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.), 342, c5258. &lt;/ref&gt; This external payment of Wakefield was heavily scrutinized as a conflict of interest in later years, implicating Barr as a co-conspirator. When questioned, Richard Horton denied knowledge of the involvement of Barr, yet JABS produced documents in 2008 suggesting that the account was made known to not only Horton but others on the ''Lancet'' staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;JABS&quot;&gt; JABS Briefing Note 9th April 2008. (2008). http://www.jabs.org.uk/documents/Jabs PR GMC 9Apl08.htm. &lt;/ref&gt; This revelation raises high-level questions about the ethics of pre-approved &quot;conflicts of interest.&quot;

===Arie Zuckerman===
At the time of the Wakefield experiments, Arie Zuckerman had transcended his role in virology at the Royal Free to become the Dean of the Medical School. He was present at the first press conference with Wakefield and immediately countered his claims, asking the media to avoid tarnishing the reputation of MMR.&lt;ref name=&quot;Is this doctor a hero&quot;&gt; Leonard, T. (2006, June 13). Is this doctor a hero or a health risk? The Telegraph. Retrieved from http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/3340790/Is-this-doctor-a-hero-or-a-health-risk.html. &lt;/ref&gt; Zuckerman also began a series of internal memos expressing concern over Wakefield's study and ultimately confronted Wakefield's co-author Dr. John Walker-Smith with the financial conflict of interest manifest in Richard Barr's contributions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zuckerman Memo&quot;&gt; Zuckerman, A. (1998, July 15). Correspondence with Professor John Walker-Smith. http://briandeer.com/mmr/money-ethics.htm. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Brent Taylor===
A Professor of Community Child Health at the Royal Free, Brent Taylor was contacted several times by Zuckerman. This correspondence examined the ethical qualms Zuckerman had regarding the ethics of Wakefield's experiments, particularly their impacts on the children involved in the study. Taylor expressed concern to Zuckerman in internal memos&lt;ref name=&quot;Zuckerman letter&quot;&gt; Taylor, B. (1998, July 23). Correspondence with Dean Arie Zuckerman. http://briandeer.com/mmr/royal-free-5.htm. &lt;/ref&gt; but also made the scientific community aware of his concerns with his first-authored June 1999 publication of &quot;Autism and measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine: no epidemiological evidence for a causal association&quot; in ''The Lancet''. This report detailed a 498-case study carried out by Taylor and six other researchers which concluded &quot;Our analyses do not support a causal association between MMR vaccine and autism. If such an association occurs, it is so rare that it could not be identified in this large regional sample.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor article&quot;&gt; Taylor, B., Miller, E., Farrington, Cp., Petropoulos, M.-C., Favot-Mayaud, I., Li, J., &amp; Waight, P. A. (1999). Autism and measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine: no epidemiological evidence for a causal association. The Lancet, 353(9169), 2026–2029. &lt;/ref&gt; Wakefield publicly condemned this study, saying that Taylor and his team &quot;ignored the rules&quot; and were &quot;inappropriately didactic in their conclusions, despite the weakness of their method and the contradictions in their data.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakefield's Rebuttal&quot;&gt;Wakefield, A. (1999, September 11). MMR vaccination and autism. The Lancet, 354(9182), 949-950. http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)75696-8/fulltext&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wakefield's Co-authors===

The 1998 ''Lancet'' article had thirteen total authors. All were associated with various subdivisions of the Royal Free, including Pediatric Gastroenterology, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Neurology, and Radiology. While all co-authors supported the 1998 paper's intentionally vague claim that &quot;chronic enterocolitis in children...may be related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction&quot; and that &quot;further investigations are needed to examine this syndrome and its possible relation to this vaccine,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1998 Lancet&quot;&gt; Wakefield, A., Murch, S., Anthony, A., Linnell, J., Casson, D., Malik, M., … Walker-Smith, J. (1998). RETRACTED: Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children. The Lancet, 351(9103), 637–641. &lt;/ref&gt; they did not support Wakefield's subsequent claims that MMR was the direct cause, particularly at the Royal Free press conference immediately before publication.&lt;ref name = &quot;Vaccine Google book&quot;&gt; Largent, M. A. (2012). Vaccine: The Debate in Modern America (Google eBook) (p. 232). JHU Press. http://books.google.com/books?id=gmsPMWQgmu4C&amp;pgis=1 &lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, 10 of the 12 co-authors (all but John Linnell and Peter Harvey) wrote &quot;Retraction of an interpretation,&quot; which was also published in ''The Lancet''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Co-Author retraction&quot;&gt;Murch, S. H., Anthony, A., Casson, D. H., Malik, M., Berelowitz, M., Dhillon, A. P., Thomson, M. A., Valentine, A., Davies, S. E., Walker-Smith, J. A. (2004, March 6). Retraction of an interpretation. The Lancet, 363. http://www.thelancet.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Wakefield, Linnell, and Harvey countered with &quot;MMR - responding to retraction&quot; one month later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakefield counter&quot;&gt; Wakefield, A. J., Harvey, P., &amp; Linnell, J. (2004). MMR--responding to retraction. Lancet, 363(9417), 1327–8; discussion 1328 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusions==
Upon analysis of the case presented here, the authors have drawn the following conclusions relating to professional ethics. Because debate is still ongoing and Wakefield's supporters still maintain his integrity, new evidence should spur further discussion about these contentions.

Andrew Wakefield’s fraudulent research led to the MMR vaccine scare, and the failures of the organizations and people around him allowed his work to have such a wide impact. His co-authors had an opportunity to review his work, but they failed to question his research methods. In failing to do so, they fell victim to the bystander effect. ''The Lancet'' also failed in its duty to promote scientific integrity. Even after its senior management was briefed about Wakefield’s unethical research, they chose to protect Wakefield rather than investigate the claims. Editor Horton showed a lack of integrity by publicly promoting research integrity while privately sweeping ethics allegations against his journal under the rug. 

Two people in this case demonstrated professionalism. Taylor acted professionally by alerting his superiors at the Royal Free Hospital about the ethics violations that he suspected in Wakefield’s work. He then used his skill as a researcher to refute Wakefield’s claims from a scientific perspective. Brian Deer also showed qualities of a professional by pursuing his journalistic work with determination. His meticulous research revealed financial conflicts of interest and outright fraud that had gone unnoticed for six years, and he weathered public criticism and lawsuits to persevere with his investigation. Taylor and Deer used their respective skills to expose the truth, and for that reason they exemplify professionalism.

      <comment>/* Sample Results */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Motivation =
You want to use environment variables to change the way an XQuery executes.

XQuery 3.0 introduced two new functions:

  available-environment-variables() as xs:string* - returns a sequence of strings of all the environment variables available

  environment-variable($name as xs:string) as xs:string? - returns the value of a specific environment variable

= Sample Program =
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;3.0&quot;;
&lt;results&gt;
    {
        for $variable in available-environment-variables()
        return
            &lt;var name=&quot;{$variable}&quot; value=&quot;{environment-variable($variable)}&quot;/&gt;
    }
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

= Sample Results =
Here are some sample results on a Windows 7 System:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;EXIST_HOME&quot; value=&quot;d:\eXist\exist-2.0&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;JAVA_HOME&quot; value=&quot;D:\Apps\java\java6&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;JAVA_OPTS&quot; value=&quot;&quot;-Xms128m -Xmx10024m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Djava.endorsed.dirs=&quot;d:\eXist\exist-2.0&quot;\lib\endorsed&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;JAVA_ENDORSED_DIRS&quot; value=&quot;&quot;d:\eXist\exist-2.0&quot;\lib\endorsed&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;JMX_PORT&quot; value=&quot;1099&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;JMX_OPTS&quot; value=&quot;&quot;-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=1099 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false&quot;&quot;/&gt;

&lt;var name=&quot;PROCESSOR_LEVEL&quot; value=&quot;6&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;PROCESSOR_REVISION&quot; value=&quot;2a07&quot;/&gt;

&lt;var name=&quot;COMPUTERNAME&quot; value=&quot;DANS-NOT-A-MAC&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;SystemRoot&quot; value=&quot;C:\Windows&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;USERNAME&quot; value=&quot;Dan&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;USERPROFILE&quot; value=&quot;C:\Users\Dan&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;SystemDrive&quot; value=&quot;C:&quot;/&gt;

&lt;var name=&quot;Path&quot; value=&quot;D:\apps\exist\exist-2.0\bin;
   D:\apps\apache-ant-1.8.3\bin;D:\apps\git\bin;
   D:\Apps\maven\bin;D:\apps\tomcat\bin;&quot;/&gt;

&lt;var name=&quot;SESSIONNAME&quot; value=&quot;Console&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;MX&quot; value=&quot;10024&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;TMP&quot; value=&quot;C:\Users\Dan\AppData\Local\Temp&quot;/&gt;

&lt;var name=&quot;PROMPT&quot; value=&quot;$P$G&quot;/&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;PATHEXT&quot; value=&quot;.COM;.EXE;.BAT;.CMD;.VBS;.VBE;.JS;.JSE;.WSF;.WSH;.MSC&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that Environment Variables are not the same as system-properties.  System properties are key-value pairs typically set by Java.  Environment Variables are typically key-value pairs associated with a shell.

      <comment>/* XQuery File */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Motivation =
You need to execute an external process such as shell command.

= Execute Process Command =

   process:execute($command as xs:string), $options and node()) as item()*

= Example of Options =

There are currently only two options documented.  The working directory and the value of the standard input:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;options&gt;
    &lt;workingDir&gt;PATH TO LOCAL FILE SYSTEM&lt;/workingDir&gt;
    &lt;stdin&gt;&lt;line&gt;INPUT STRING&lt;/line&gt;&lt;/stdin&gt;
&lt;/options&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

= Sample Program =

== XQuery File ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace process=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/process&quot; at &quot;java:org.exist.xquery.modules.process.ProcessModule&quot;;

let $cmd := 'D:\Apps\git\bin\ls.exe'
return
&lt;results&gt;
{process:execute($cmd, &lt;options/&gt;)}
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample Output ==
Here is an example of the git &quot;ls&quot; command being run without any options.  Note that the default is the EXIST_HOME directory.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;execution exitCode=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;commandline&gt;D:\Apps\git\bin\ls.exe &lt;/commandline&gt;
    &lt;stdout&gt;
        &lt;line&gt;Install_V2.0_20130212155217_6931977091675999583.log&lt;/line&gt;
        &lt;line&gt;LICENSE&lt;/line&gt;
        &lt;line&gt;README&lt;/line&gt;
        &lt;line&gt;VERSION.txt&lt;/line&gt;
        &lt;line&gt;atom-example.xq&lt;/line&gt;
        &lt;line&gt;atom-services.xml&lt;/line&gt;
        &lt;line&gt;autodeploy&lt;/line&gt;

[[User:AlexaSoccer|AlexaSoccer]] ([[User talk:AlexaSoccer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AlexaSoccer|contribs]]) 12:23, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Cool, this is just a quick, draft intro to get us started

Intro-
The definition of technological determinism can be regarded as the cultural implications of new media, by bringing into concern the history behind media theory and production and the way these frameworks develop social and cultural structures. With media technologies constantly developing allowing for instant and convenient communication, theorists have argued that this has influenced social progressions. New media technologies have revolutionised everyday life to an extent where humans are able to form self-identifications through social networking, consume media productions through television, computers and other means and also communicate from a local to a global scale. By assessing theorists work such as Marshall McLuhan who poses the idea that reforming media affects how humans distinguish and value the world around them and the differences between media such as what McLuhan states as ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ media, we can establish how technology is determined through the shaping of cultural and social formations. 

[[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 13:14, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Sickk! Well done - why don't you do just go ahead and have the intro as your section. I'll do Technological Imperative as mine. When do you think we should post them to the main page?

[[User:AlexaSoccer|AlexaSoccer]] ([[User talk:AlexaSoccer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AlexaSoccer|contribs]]) 10:46, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Technological Imperative
Technological imperative is the assumption that technology cannot be stopped in its development, and that technological progress is irreversible, unavoidable, and inevitable. Essentially, this theory assumes that because we are able to do something because of a particular technology, we ought to, must, or will do it. It is the theory that what can be done, will be done. 

This is important to technological determinism as it recognizes the influence of technology on action. It drives society to act on not only what they are able to do, but also push the boundaries and test limits because, as John von Neumann observed, “technological possibilities are irresistible to man”. (Mumford 1971, p. 186) With this, the theory acknowledges the shift from technology as a means to technology as an end.
Critics of the theory, including Jacques Ellul and Ivan Illich, argue that the theory of technological imperative cannot be fully accurate, as not all areas of available progress are being exploited. The main argument stems from the lack of drive to create renewable energy sources. 

Here's a start to my section!

I think we should aim to have a start of everybody's bit up by Wednesday?

[[User:AlexaSoccer|AlexaSoccer]] ([[User talk:AlexaSoccer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AlexaSoccer|contribs]]) 09:55, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Sweet! That's really good, yeah I forgot to reference mine, well done for remembering. Yeah Wednesday is a good aim!

Yeah think that's a good idea. So it's just context/origin, notable determinists and criticism/debate left? [[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 15:07, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Has anyone found any really good readings for our topic? 

[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 12:14, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I've looked at the lecture slides- Marshall McLuhan, Raymond Williams, Daniel Chandler, etc.
[[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 14:25, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Looked at a few of the other groups, how do you want to lay it out, shall we have theorists first and a bit about them, or concepts along with theorists? [[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 14:39, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah I think we should seperate it into two main parts - technological determinism and the opposite view of cultural determinism. Then maybe outline the theorists and theories associated with each?
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 14:49, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah, I think that's a good idea. It's tricky because everything overlaps/connects! [[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 16:55, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Well we should be able to talk about how we overcome that issue for our presentation, woo progress! Ok i'm happy to give &quot;Notable Determinists&quot; and try and have some content up for later this evening. I will make sure to link any sources i find to you guys [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 17:23, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Ok guys i found some useful academic reading available here [http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=WWztFfsA-QEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=technological+determinism&amp;ots=aEmmMMUboN&amp;sig=SS_5VzO_OBSiPSKGquTWsaVie3Q#v=onepage&amp;q=technological%20determinism&amp;f=false This link ][[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 17:45, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Some further reading that I believe will be useful for assisting in the writing of the origin/context sections http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/tecdet/tdet02.html  [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 18:00, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Ooh thats good, I'll have a look! I've just done a bit on television as being a technology with a cause an effect which I think links to cultural determinsim. I'll just post it up here first..

Raymond Williams ‘insists that the future of our media will depend on our capacity to make informed judgements and decisions about that future.’
Our world, society and history are continually altered by whatever new technology comes along: the steam engine, the automobile, the atomic bomb. (Williams, 2003:1). Technology such as television is often argued that it has effects on social behaviour and cultural and psychological conditions. However these effects are the result of the technology being the cause. The notions of a cause and effect between a technology and society, a technology and a culture and a technology and a psychology are quite complex to apply answers and theories to. Williams, however goes on to analyse specifically television as a technology that results in cultural pattern shifts. 
Williams states that television has altered our world. In this sense it has been created ‘as a result of scientific and technical research’ yet television has been used in many other forms:

•	As a tool for social communication to construct social relationships.

•	It provides us with certain perceptions of reality within the world

•	It provides a strong mode of communication through news and entertainment

•	Through television advertising is made possible to promote goods to society

•	It follows a set of systems to what society wants from television by attending to opinions and styles of behaviour from what is produced.

Arguably the development of television and overall technology cannot be assumed to purposefully direct society into conforming to change. Technology should be considered as a typical invention of which is accidental in its proceedings (Williams, 2003:5). 

On the other hand, technology through significant media forces has reshaped the way in which humans behave, the structure of human societies and even language. Media even has the power to change governments (Collins &amp; Evans, 2006:50). 
[[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 18:03, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Sweet! Ok I added subheadings to the main concepts section just thought i'd let you guys know [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 18:24, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

After reading through the introduction it might be better to have the definition subheading under introduction rather than main concepts if you would rather split your introduction paragraph up [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 21:06, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I think we could keep the definition section under main concepts and have a separate introduction because they are kind of different. Would give us more content too.
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 21:35, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

The introduction sounds great well done, I think I'm getting to grips with this now after today's seminar and messing about on this for a bit. I'll happily cover the criticism's bit of of this and have this in after some reading, I'll post it on here first so you lot can have your say on it. I'll try get a few general resources as well. Remember our main way of engaging will be done by commenting on other groups and their pages, linking in our technological determinism on the posts of the other groups would be great. Would everyone want to meet up on Thursday? We could get one of the seminar type rooms in the library and stay there for a bit? Plus, sorry that I chose 'the coMEDIAns' as our group name, it's pretty bloody awful. ([[User:TallNorthernIrishEthan|TallNorthernIrishEthan]] ([[User talk:TallNorthernIrishEthan|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TallNorthernIrishEthan|contribs]]) 22:31, 1 April 2014 (UTC))

Top work guys. I've been swamped with work but I'm free from tomorrow now so I'll work on Context/Origin. Again, will post here first to make sure we're all happy with it first off. I'm more than happy to meet up on Thursday if needs be as I have a free day. Will have this done. [[User:ElliotNotEthan|ElliotNotEthan]] ([[User talk:ElliotNotEthan|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ElliotNotEthan|contribs]]) 22:41, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah I think that's a good idea to meet on Thursday and get a group study room. Can all work on it at the same time if we bring laptops. Haha nah I think the group name is pretty good actually! So could I work on the definition and bulk it out a bit?
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 22:50, 1 April 2014 (UTC)


Sick guys - Thursday sounds good! As for the tech/cultural determinism bit i think we should definitely stay heavier on the tech part because that's our actual topic. As for the subheadings it seems like we're getting more based on what we're doing with our original bit which is good! I think it's gonna be hard not to go to broad though so we should be careful. Also, we should think of ways to start linking to other groups? 
[[User:AlexaSoccer|AlexaSoccer]] ([[User talk:AlexaSoccer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AlexaSoccer|contribs]]) 07:40, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

For the cultural determinism bit, how heavy do y'all want to make the content? What if we put that in the criticism bit as an alternative view?
[[User:AlexaSoccer|AlexaSoccer]] ([[User talk:AlexaSoccer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AlexaSoccer|contribs]]) 07:44, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah Connor, do you want to just edit that bit then? Thursday sounds great! For cultural determinism yeah it's to do with the way humans formate and behave from the way we are raised rather than how technology influences us, so it's definitely different! I think we can relate the two with a bit about Karl Marx maybe? Marx seems to be quite a key figure in social formations/changes (yeh I know he's everywhere...) What do you think?
[[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 08:58, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Oh and we can put him down as a notable determinist! [[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 09:13, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah I think you can have tech determinism as the main part then cultural/criticism as the alternative view point. Is it alright that I do definition? Think we should split the introduction and definition into two seperate parts and would like to work on bulking out the definition part a bit.
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 12:42, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Seems like a good idea Sophie it allows us to put more detail into it but remember to take it out of the intro so we are not repeating points, it might also be a good idea to include a section that shows how Technological determinism underpins other areas such as always on etc... any thoughts? [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 13:16, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Showing how it underpins other areas would allow us to make contact with other groups and have a decent area to start talking on when it came to the presentation I think. [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 13:18, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Brilliant, I'll get cracking on with that then. Yeah I think that's a really good idea too, can talk to other groups and get more contribution as you say.
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 13:25, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Aside from Marshall McLuhan who would be considered a notable technological determinist? Has anyone found any reading on the matter? The best I seem to be able to find is Van Koten from the resource list? [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 14:07, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi guys - was thinking about your bit when doing my piece on 'Always-on'. It ties in with McLuhan's work so I've written this extra bit (its at the end of this post) - I was going to post it on the main book but thought I'd check-in with you guys first. Let me know what you think. &quot;McLuhan’s assertion that the medium is the message is perhaps now becoming a less unlikely theory than was first thought. He asserted that technology is like a bodily extension just like a hammer is an extension of the arm (REF) and the recent announcements by Google, Intel, and Facebook all that they were investing heavily in wearable technology is testimony to McLuhan’s theory. Facebook recently bought virtual reality technology firm Oculus VR for £1.2bn and Mark Zuckerberg claimed that “virtual reality will be the next social communications platform” (The Guardian, 25th March, 2014). His statement that this wearable technology will “change the way we work, play and communicate” (BBC 26th March, 2014) directly supports McLuhan’s stance.
Google’s new smart glasses, called ‘Google Glass’ will be designed by the makers of Ray-Ban sunglasses and Oakley sports glasses to ensure they were at the cutting edge of fashion (The Guardian, 25th March, 2014; BBC 25th March, 2014). Google Glass is a small screen attached to a pair of glasses which can record video, access email, and retrieve information from the web by connecting wirelessly to a user's mobile phone. Intel, the world’s largest computer chip maker, increased its investment in wearable technology by buying Basis Science, a company that has devices and services for tracking a person’s health, and wanted to accelerate its position in wearable technology (BBC 26th March, 2014).&quot; Cheers.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 14:35, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Seems like a really good idea George, as I am currently doing a section on notable determinists would you be ok with me adding a link to your section under my explanation of McLuhans idea of technology extending the human body? [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 14:40, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys thats me finished the section on McLuhans Global Village still have to do a section of his idea of technology extending the human body.

This is a term coined by McLuhan in reference to what he calls the Electronic culture that arises with the increased use of televisions and computers. A way of understanding this is that the improvement in technology has allowed for much quicker communication. In theory this allows for the entire world to be compressed into a Global Village where everyone can quickly communicate with each other, whereas in practice this has manifested itself through the internet allowing for an individual to have a much larger number of  near constant social connections. A very recent example of this would be the case of popular social media site Facebook in which an average adult user is said to have 338 friends which clearly shows the breaking down of distance and ease of communication that McLuhan conveys in his idea of the global village.
McLuhan also suggests that the people who live in this electronic culture, or global village gain all the benefits and downfalls of new technologies and so whereas distances are no longer a problem for communication, technology barriers and development or lack of it can still provide issues(Smith,R and Marx,L. 1994.)   [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 15:17, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Hi Connor - no problem with you making that link to our section under your explanation of McLuhans idea of technology extending the human body. Your material looks really good. Do you want me to paste the bit above onto your main page along with the references?[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 15:29, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I added a little more content to my Global Village part as i felt it was lacking
This is a term coined by McLuhan in reference to what he calls the Electronic culture that arises with the increased use of televisions and computers. A way of understanding this is that the improvement in technology has allowed for much quicker communication. In theory this allows for the entire world to be compressed into a Global Village where everyone can quickly communicate with each other, whereas in practice this has manifested itself through the internet allowing for an individual to have a much larger number of  near constant social connections. A very recent example of this would be the case of popular social media site Facebook in which an average adult user is said to have 338 friends which clearly shows the breaking down of distance and ease of communication that McLuhan conveys in his idea of the global village.(1) This can be also be further established by looking at the numbers of people that use the most common social networking sites, 1.23 billion monthly active users on facebook and over 1 billion unique youtube user visits per month. This puts people in potential contact with more people than they could meet or speak to in their lifetime and hence again strengthens the idea of the global village. Another idea of this is that through the quick access and speed of response that comes with this type of technology we are able to react to global issues far faster than previous. Therefore issues that may have once not have been of concern can be addressed by a much bigger crowd, this follows the same underlying concept of increasing technology reducing distances and effectively making the world a smaller more accessible place. McLuhan also suggests that the people who live in this electronic culture, or global village gain all the benefits and downfalls of new technologies and so whereas distances are no longer a problem for communication, technology barriers and development or lack of it can still provide  [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 16:15, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Great work Connor! I've been using Harvard referencing, but how do you guys want to reference so they're not all different? I think we should all start posting up on the main page so it's easier for everyone to see what informations been posted so nothing is getting repeated! I'm going to post up my little section on Raymond Williams in the criticism and debate section if thats ok?

== Tech Imperative Posting ==

Hey guys - here's what I'm going to post to the main page for my section... I posted to the Always On folk about using their disinhibition stuff so hopefully i'll put that in there soon!
__________________________________

Technological imperative, also known as the inevitability thesis,  is the assumption that technology cannot be stopped in its development, and that technological progress is irreversible, unavoidable, and inevitable. Essentially, this theory assumes that because we are able to do something because of a particular technology, we ought to, must, or will do it. It is the theory that what can be done, will be done, whether or not it is moral, good, or productive for mankind. 


This is important to technological determinism as it recognizes the influence of technology on action. It drives society to act on not only what they are able to do, but also push the boundaries and test limits because, as John von Neumann observed, “technological possibilities are irresistible to man”. (Mumford 1971, p. 186) With this, the theory acknowledges the shift from technology as a means to technology as an end. Critics of the theory, including Jacques Ellul and Ivan Illich, argue that the theory of technological imperative cannot be fully accurate, as not all areas of available progress are being exploited. The main argument stems from the lack of drive to create renewable energy sources.


&quot;Arnold Pacey suggests that the technological imperative is commonly taken to be 'the lure of always pushing toward the greatest feat of technical performance or complexity which is currently available' (Pacey 1983, p. 79). The mathematician John von Neumann wrote with some alarm that 'technological possibilities are irresistible to man.' (in Mumford 1971, p. 186). Jacques Soustelle declared of the atomic bomb that 'Since it was possible, it was necessary' (in Ellul 1964, p. 99). And fatalists might add that since we can now destroy the planet, in time we will. The technological imperative is a common assumption amongst commentators on 'new technologies'. They tell us, for instance, that the 'information technology revolution' is inevitably on its way and our task as users is to learn to cope with it.&quot;[1]


According to McLuhan, the media dictates the message - an argument that becomes extremely relevant when according to technological imperative, society is unable to resist the development of technology and so also the continual development of media platforms.

'Deterministic perspectives have been common amongst commentators on communication technologies. Theorists who have argued that changes in communication technologies have had an important cultural impact have tended either to regard such changes as limited to social and institutional practices or, far more radically, have argued that such changes have also had profound psychological consequences, transforming the nature of human consciousness.' I'm adding this into my section on origin and content but if anyone thinks its more relevant to their section feel free to use it. Took it from this site which is quite useful - http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/tecdet/tdet11.html [[User:ElliotNotEthan|ElliotNotEthan]] ([[User talk:ElliotNotEthan|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ElliotNotEthan|contribs]]) 12:56, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Ok guys thats me done (some) of the writing for McLuhans idea of extending the human body, its short but i was thinking we could put Georges piece as a follow on from mine? thoughts? --
This is the assertion by McLuhan that technology are tools that extend the human body and more accurately, extend or amplifies the abilities of the visual and aural senses mainly. Examples of this would be the television extending the visual senses or the telephone extending the aural. McLuhan goes on to say that technology in fact changes the way we act in society  and that nowadays people “wears its brain outside its skull and its nerves outside its hide” (McLuhan, 1966) (4.) Although at first this may seem an obscure and nonsensical view it can be comprehended in that much of the technology we use for interacting and viewing the world start at our fingertips and with the technology that we consume.

Ok I've just added my bit on the overview and definition of technological determinism. I've added this part for introduction:
Technological determinism in its most basic form is the idea that technology has a significant effect on society. The theory presents the idea that technology is the reason for developments in our society, influencing our lives at a number of levels. Determinists believe that technology influences society on different levels; impacting on industry, the way we communicate and even shapes individuals. 

Then I've put in a heading 'overview' and moved Annie's section with my additional part on strong/weak determinism:

Technological determinism comes in two main variations – a strong and weaker form. 

•	Strong or hard determinism argues that technology is the foremost or sole reason for the way society is structured and any development in our culture. Technology is seen as the “prime mover in history” (Chandler, 2000:1).

•	Weak or soft determinism is a less extreme argument, more approved of by scholars. It sees technology as more of an enabler for societal change. Rather than viewing technology as the sole or primary reason for anything that happens in society, it takes into account other factors and argues that technology gives us opportunities for development but does not necessarily cause it.

Just about to add this to the criticisms bit, that okay? 

Further criticism of Technological Determinism is found in the idea that the theory is written in a broad sense. McLuhan also fails to mention how technologies are constructed yet implicitly speaks of the way in which humans interact with technology. McLuhan also fails to acknowledge the idea of ‘technological innovation’ this is despite the fact that this technologies are created through the human interplay with various technologies that McLuhan holds in high regard (Cana 2003).

I'll add the references obviously!

You could write the piece on Hamid Van Koten if you wanted to, my thought was to write about light on/through media and put it in the notable determinist section. I'd also mention how he had been fairly heavily influenced by McLuhan Reading from week 2 should help for this [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 19:08, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah that's brilliant, thanks! Will get on with that. Yeah sounds like it would be a good addition to the notable determinists section as we only have McLuhan right now.

Does anyone know whether it was Van Koten who came up with the light on/light through notion? I know he writes about it but doesn't explicitly say who came up with it.
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 19:48, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Unfortunately im not sure Sophie, That's me done the Hot or Cool media section though im going to go ahead and post ti to the book  -- A way in which Mcluhan categorises different forms of media is through a temperature type scale in which there are both hot and cool types of media, as with much of McLuhan's writings this is not an initially intuitive process. A media type is considered hot if it heavily utilises and immerses one sense in particular. An example of this may be the comparison of a photograph which gives a large and detailed amount of visual information and hence a hot media form to a sketched cartoon which gives a minimal amount of information visually. (Van Koten, 2009) Furthermore McLuhan suggests that it is cool media that involves a higher amount of interpretation from the consumer than hotter forms of media. This can again be thought of as a photo presenting visual information more clearly where as a drawing may need to be interpreted in terms of shapes and colours and a have a meaning drawn less easily from this.  [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 19:59, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Also do you think it would be beneficial to add a table of different types of hot and cool media to this section? I was also thinking of adding a critisism section to hot and cool media and say why it is no longer applicable? [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 20:00, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Ok, no worries. Will just put it the light on/light through notion as an alternative to your section on hot and cool. Yeah think a table would be a good idea. There's quite a good one in the Van Koten reading or this website I found on hot and cool: http://tribes.tribe.net/marshallmcluhan/thread/72cd0899-94ec-42c2-a6db-2de4fa4cec1e and yeah criticism would probably be good too. 
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 20:10, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks Sophie that was very helpful, are you going to put it under Notable determinists or under criticisms? I thought you could have put it under notable determinists and mentioned that he was influenced by McLuhan and carried his ideas on. Just my thoughts on the matter, i'll get cracking with criticisms of hot and cool media categorisations. [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 20:29, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

No bother. Well I was going to put it under hot and cool media as it ties in really well with that and I can't find anything directly on Van Koten. He seems to have just written about other people rather than being a main theorist himself. Would that be ok with you? 

This is what I have written so far...Similar to McLuhan’s idea of hot and cool media is the notion of light on and light through media. ‘Light on’ media is where the light source bounces off a surface or object before hitting the viewers’ eyes. Therefore the light is projected onto a screen (Van Koten, 2009). ‘Light through’ media is where the light source is positioned in front of audience; therefore making the audience the screen by projecting light onto them (Van Koten, 2009). In likeness to hot and cool media, ‘light on’ would be described as hot because it is “all revealing” where ‘light through’ is less revealing, more “mysterious” so therefore cool (Van Koten, 2009, p.91). An example of ‘light on’ media is cinema, with light coming from behind the audience and no room for interaction. An example of ‘light through’ media is television where the light projects from the TV onto the viewers and gives them more room for interpretation and interaction. 
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 20:33, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

That seems fair, here is my peice that i will put under the critisism section of the book on hot and cool media -- As McLuhan has the tendency of doing in his writing the Hot and Cool media temperature scale comes with a number of criticisms due to the somewhat vague nature it is described in. Firstly there is no actual way of measuring the temperature of a media form and so being able to determine is one type of media is hotter or cooler than another. This means that it is a subjective scale and that any consensus comes down to the opinions of the people using it, therefore leaving it prone to bias and somewhat less useful. To add to this the scale can only be used when comparing two media forms that have somewhat similar aims or place emphasis on the same senses such as the radio and telephone. As much of McLuhan's work is not particularly recent it also does not include or take into consideration many recent updates in technology.Examples of this would be the improvement of televisions with high definition capabilities and video calling technology availability commonly on smart phones and therefore it can in many cases be discarded as a flawed method of gauging media.

I also placed the glossary in alphabetical order, I did this as a starting point for the glossary as it might be more appropriate and polished looking, so if you could continue in the same way that'd be great! ([[User:TallNorthernIrishEthan|TallNorthernIrishEthan]] ([[User talk:TallNorthernIrishEthan|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TallNorthernIrishEthan|contribs]]) 03:54, 4 April 2014 (UTC))

Hi guys, I just added the sub heading &quot;Problems with McLuhan's &quot;the medium is in the message&quot; and information on this, in the criticisms bit. I found an interesting piece on it! I also added another paragraph which questions whether determinism is too determined based on the scholar Ong (1989) as I thought it was interesting, this can also be found in the criticism's bit. I hope it's okay? Feel free to edit this if you deem it necessary, also, Ong (1989) was added to the reference list inkeeping with the alphabetical order.

Hey guys, great work! It's finally coming together, I noticed online identity has a link but it's in red, does anyone know how to sort that? If not I shall go to reading room [[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 09:34, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Great work guys. Love the added links to the theorists' main Wikipedia pages. Yes Annie, the reading room told me how to do that yesterday so have just fixed it now. I was planning on adding a section to online identity today if that's ok? 
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 10:11, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks Sophie, yeah go ahead! [[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 10:51, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Ok I've just posted this bit up on Ray Kurweil in notable determinists although I shall try to add a bit more about him.

Ray Kurzweil, a futurist specified in speech recognition technology and the future of technology such as robotics and biotechnology is notable as a technological determinist with his assessment of the history of technology and its rate of progress. 

Kurzweil assumes that the rate of progress of technology is at such a high speed that technological intelligence will surpass human intelligence within a few decades (Kurzweil, 382). He argues that although the future holds technological change so fast human nature will take longer to adapt to changes and the rapid pace of innovation. 

[[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 12:24, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

That's brilliant, we were needing another section for notable determinists. 
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 12:54, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah that's what I was thinking, how are you getting on with online-identity? Do you need help at all? [[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 13:04, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah I think our page is starting to look really good now. Getting on fine thanks. Not really, just writing up a section on it which will hopefully fit in nicely with always on. Don't have any sources for it though, do you think that's ok?
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 13:16, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Ok no bother! Yeh I don't think sources are too necessary because we've linked to the other groups page (which is packed full of content) I've added a bit more to Kurzweil and added an external link to Moore's Law, is it ok to link to wikipedia? Noticed someone else had linked to it on Non-Marxist theories. [[User:AnnieMCook|AnnieMCook]] ([[User talk:AnnieMCook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AnnieMCook|contribs]]) 13:50, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Great, pretty much finished it now so will just get it on the main page. Yeah I think that's fine to link to Wikipedia, looks good when it comes to theorists' pages etc. so go ahead. 
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 14:34, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I've added a few things to the glossary aswell including 'the medium is the message' 'non Marxist' and 'social media. Obviously the latter is self explanatary but I thought it was important to explicitly define the first two as they'll help with the overall understanding of the piece. I wouldn't have fully understood what a non Marxist was on without it!

== Editing ==

Hey guys I'm just starting to go through now and edit a bit - grammatical stuff and what not. I'm fleshing things out a bit if it needs it but it looks really good!
[[User:AlexaSoccer|AlexaSoccer]] ([[User talk:AlexaSoccer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AlexaSoccer|contribs]]) 13:57, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

It all looks pretty good to me - are there any more areas yall think we need to work on?
[[User:AlexaSoccer|AlexaSoccer]] ([[User talk:AlexaSoccer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/AlexaSoccer|contribs]]) 14:15, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Brilliant! I've just got a little section I'm about to put up on online identity but other than that, think all the sections are done. Just need read over really.
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 14:34, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm going to try and add another few things to the glossary to beef it out further as it's one of the few things we can really add to at this stage, hope that's okay! I'll have another read through it and see if anymore edits need to be made aswell. ([[User:TallNorthernIrishEthan|TallNorthernIrishEthan]] ([[User talk:TallNorthernIrishEthan|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TallNorthernIrishEthan|contribs]]) 14:45, 4 April 2014 (UTC))

Yeah that's great. Saw you had put a bit up on online identity Alexa so have just added my section into what you had. 
[[User:Sophie Michele Addison|Sophie Michele Addison]] ([[User talk:Sophie Michele Addison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sophie Michele Addison|contribs]]) 14:53, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Just remember to press the minor edits button for those kind of things (spelling mistakes etc) [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 15:04, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I've just edged out a few things on the page there, does a minor edits button come up each time you edit the page? ([[User:TallNorthernIrishEthan|TallNorthernIrishEthan]] ([[User talk:TallNorthernIrishEthan|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TallNorthernIrishEthan|contribs]]) 15:20, 4 April 2014 (UTC))

Yeah its a little tick box at the bottom, also guys you might want to add yourselves to the contributors section on the home page do this by using only 3 tildes (~)   [[User:Connor Zahariev|Connor Zahariev]] ([[User talk:Connor Zahariev|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Zahariev|contribs]]) 15:30, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah I've just added myself to the main users page too.

Hi there! I'd be up for doing that! I should have the gaming part up today and how it blends the real and imaginary identities, so then I can try integrate your part :) This sounds like a really interesting point of discussion!

      <comment>/* Sample XUnit Test */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= Background =
Git has many features for managing data when many users are changing files around the world.  Git has tools for seeing who has changed what data and how to view the differences.  These features are not available in eXist (yet).  However their is no standard REST interface for git.

= Installing eXgit =
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Note: this is a work in progress.  Not done!  We hope to have a packinging tool and
a simple to install .xar file in the future.&lt;/font&gt;

The software for eXgit is stored on github here:

   https://github.com/shabanovd/eXgit

This software depends on the Git Java library here:

   https://github.com/eclipse/egit-github

You will need to build this project but the ONLY jar you need is:

  org.eclipse.jgit.jar (Note, this is a 1.7MB file)

To build this I downloaded the zip file from github and did &quot;mvn install&quot;.  I did get errors so I had to do Mavin build with no tests:

   mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

Once you have both the jar files you can put them into $EXIST/lib/user

  eXgit-0.3.0.jar
  org.eclipse.jgit.jar

You can now build the &quot;xar file:

   $ ant

This will put a build/eXgit-0.2.2.xar (about 1.6MB with the two jar files)

You can then load this into your eXist dashboard.

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Note, for some reason the jar files are not working.  We removed the reference to them in exist.xml and the build file and just manually copied them into the $EXIST_HOME/lib/user area.&lt;/font&gt;

Note that now the .xar file is about 2K!

= Testing Installation =
You must have a local git checkout.

Use this as your import statement:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace git=&quot;http://exist-db.org/git&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample XUnit Test ==
To test this you can clone any git repository.  For example the following will make a copy
of the eXide project in /db/exide.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
import module namespace git=&quot;http://exist-db.org/git&quot;;
git:clone(&quot;https://github.com/wolfgangmm/eXide.git&quot;, &quot;/db/exide&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

After this test runs you will notice that a .git file has been created in /db/exide/.git with all the git administrative files

[[File:Git-clone-to-exist-result.png|center|frame|Screen image after git repository has been cloned into eXist.]]

= Sample Unit Test =

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace git=&quot;http://exist-db.org/git&quot;;

let $git-checkout-dir := 'd:\ws\exist'

return
&lt;testcase name=&quot;status&quot; classname=&quot;http://exist-db.org/git&quot;&gt;
   {git:status($git-checkout-dir, '', false())}
&lt;/testcase&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

A novel by Kurdish-Syrian novelit Haitham Hussein in Arabic (آرام سليل الأوجاع المكابرة)  publisher: Dar Al Yanabih, Sweden 2006, Second edition by Dar Al Nahrin, Damascus 2010.
&lt;ref&gt;http://kurdistantribune.com/2012/haitham-hussein-continuing-story-of-syrian-kurd-novelist/&lt;/ref&gt;This novel talks about the yearning for returning home. His two main characters have the same name, Aram, and reflect a general phenomenon, not just an individual case. One is trying to immigrate to Germany and the other Aram lived in Germany for years. Hussein shows how the Syrian government by commission played a role of pushing Kurdish youths to leave their cities for anonymous places. Aram lives the cultural shock in Germany but, at a certain point in life, he decides to return home despite the unfair practices against him. In the face of tyranny, he decides to agitate for a revolution, landing into prison where he is tortured.  He gets released and, unfazed, wants to start again in a show to his fellow desperate souls that life neither stops nor will the current slow down for a resistant fish and that beautiful days will come. This novel shows the psychological side of the Kurdish people and their rebellion before the Syrian Revolution.

__TOC__
&lt;/div&gt;


Foreign Keys define a directed reference from one table (the child) to another table (the parent). This reference acts as long as the involved columns of the two tables contain identical values. It couples one row of the child table to a single row of the parent table - a row of the parent table may be coupled by many rows of the child table.

E.g.: You may have the table ''department'' with column ''id'' and the table ''employee'' with column ''dept_id''. If you want to assign an employee to a distinct department, you store the department-id in its column ''dept_id''. This can be done in every case - independent from any Foreign Key definition. But in such cases people often have two additional requirements: First, employees shall only be assigned to  departments which really exist. Second, as long as employees are assigned to a distinct department, it shall be impossible to delete this department. The main purpose of Foreign Keys is to guarantee these two requirements.

In other words: Foreign Keys guarantee that '''no orphans''' will arise.

== Foreign Key vs. Join ==

Within RDBMs identical values are used to link rows of different - and sometimes of the same - table together. Because this linking works on the basis of values and not of any link or special reference it has no direction. In general we call this technique a '''JOIN'''. '''Foreign Keys''' have a very similar concept because they also link rows with identical values together. But there are important differences:

:*Foreign Keys have a direction. It is important to know which one of the two affected tables is the child table and which one is the parent table.
:*Joins must be expressed within every DML statement which is interested in this join (with the exception of views). In contrast Foreign Keys are part of table definitions. All DML commands bear them in mind without expressing them within a DML statement.

== Syntax ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot; style=&quot;background:LightGreen&quot;&gt;
-- As part of CREATE TABLE command
CREATE TABLE &lt;table_name&gt; (
  ...
  CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint_name&gt; FOREIGN KEY (&lt;column_name&gt;) REFERENCES &lt;parent_table_name&gt; (&lt;other_column_name&gt;)
);

-- As part of ALTER TABLE command
ALTER TABLE &lt;table_name&gt; ADD  CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint_name&gt; ... ; -- same as above
ALTER TABLE &lt;table_name&gt; DROP CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint_name&gt;;      -- throw the definition away
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Rules:
:*FK-constraints can be defined during table definition (CREATE TABLE) or afterwards (ALTER TABLE). On this page we focus on the CREATE TABLE statement. The syntax of the ALTER TABLE statement is very similar.
:*FK-constraints belong to the child table definition.
:*Despite an existing FK-constraint it is possible that rows of the child table don't belong to any parent row. This occurs if the column value of the child row is NULL. If you want to avoid such situations, define the column as 'NOT NULL'.
:*Although the FK-constraints belong to the child table, they also have consequences for the parent table such that rows of the parent table, which have existing rows in the child table, can not be deleted.
:*The denoted parent table must exist.
:*The denoted column of the parent table must be its Primary Key or a column which is UNIQUE.
:*It is perfectly all right to use the same table as parent and child table within one FK-constraint, see: [[Structured Query Language/Foreign_Key#Exercises|Exercises]].
:*One table may be subject of a lot of FK-contraints.

== Example ==
The example defines the tables ''department'' and ''employee''. The Foreign Key definition of ''employee'' declares ''department'' as the parent table of ''employee''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
-- The parent table: DEPARTMENT
CREATE TABLE department (
  id         DECIMAL,
  dept_no    CHAR(10),
  dept_name  VARCHAR(100),
  CONSTRAINT dept_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- The child table: EMPLOYEE
CREATE TABLE employee (
  id         DECIMAL,
  emp_name   VARCHAR(100),
  dept_id    DECIMAL,
  CONSTRAINT emp_pk PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT emp_dept_fk FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES department(id)
);

-- This INSERT will fail because actually there is no department with id 10.
INSERT INTO employee   (id, emp_name, dept_id)  VALUES (1, 'Mike Baker', 10);
COMMIT;

-- It's necessary to store the department first.
INSERT INTO department (id, dept_no, dept_name) VALUES (10,'D10', 'E-Bike Development');
INSERT INTO employee   (id, emp_name, dept_id)  VALUES (1, 'Mike Baker', 10);
COMMIT;

-- The department may have a lot of employees
INSERT INTO employee   (id, emp_name, dept_id)  VALUES (2, 'Elenore McNeal', 10);
INSERT INTO employee   (id, emp_name, dept_id)  VALUES (3, 'Ted Walker', 10);
COMMIT;

-- This DELETE will fail because actually there are employees within the department.
DELETE FROM department WHERE dept_name = 'E-Bike Development';
COMMIT;

&lt;/source&gt;

This kind of modelling allows the representation of hierarchical tree structures. One or many child nodes (rows) belong to a single parent node (row). In the context of DBMS this kind of association is called a 1:m relationship.

== n:m Relationship ==
In the real world there are more association types than 1:m relationships. Often there are so called n:m relationships where objects (rows) belong to more than 1 other object (row). Thereby the meaning of parent/child tables gets lost. In our [[Structured Query Language/Example Database Structure#person_hobby|example database]] there is a table ''hobby'' and another table ''person''. One person may pursue multiple hobbies. At the same time multiple persons may pursue the same hobby. This can be designed by creating a third table between the two original tables. The third table holds the id's of the first and second table. So one can decide which person pursues which hobby.

The technique to realize this n:m situation is the same as shown in the previous chapter with its 1:m association - it is only used twice. We define two Foreign Keys which start from the 'table-in-the-middle' and refers to the two other tables. In a technical sense we can say, that the 'table-in-the-middle' is the child table for the two parent tables ''person'' and ''hobby''. ''person'' and ''hobby'' are at the same logical level.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
CREATE TABLE t1 (
  id               DECIMAL,
  name             VARCHAR(50),
  -- ...
  CONSTRAINT t1_pk               PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
CREATE TABLE t2 (
  id               DECIMAL,
  name             VARCHAR(50),
  -- ...
  CONSTRAINT t2_pk               PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
CREATE TABLE t1_t2 (
  id               DECIMAL,
  t1_id            DECIMAL,
  t2_id            DECIMAL,
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_pk            PRIMARY KEY (id),       -- also this table should have its own Primary Key
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_unique        UNIQUE (t1_id, t2_id),  -- every link should occur only once
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_fk_1          FOREIGN KEY (t1_id) REFERENCES t1(id),
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_fk_2          FOREIGN KEY (t2_id) REFERENCES t2(id)
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== ON DELETE / ON UPDATE ==

So far we have assumed that rows of the parent table cannot be deleted if a row in the child table exists which refers to this parent row. This is the default, but all in all the SQL standard defines five options to handle this parent/child situation in various ways. The options extend the constraint definition. They are:
:*ON DELETE CASCADE: If a row of the parent table is deleted, then all matching rows in the referencing table are deleted.
:*ON DELETE SET NULL: If a row of the parent table is deleted, then all referencing columns in all matching rows of the child table are set to NULL.
:*ON DELETE SET DEFAULT: If a row of the parent table is deleted, then all referencing columns in all matching rows of the child table are set to the column’s default value.
:*ON DELETE RESTRICT: It is prohibited to delete a row of the parent table if that row has any matching rows in the child table. The point in time when checking occures can be deferred until COMMIT.
:*ON DELETE NO ACTION (the default): It is prohibited to delete a row of the parent table if that row has any matching rows in the child table. This holds true in ALL cases, even if checking is deferred (see next chapter).

Analog to the ON DELETE option there is an ON UPDATE option. It defines the same five options for the case of changing a column in the parent table which is referred by the column of a child table.
:*ON UPDATE CASCADE: Any change to a referenced column in the parent table causes the same change to the corresponding referencing column in matching rows of the child table.
:*ON UPDATE SET NULL: Any change to a referenced column in the parent table causes the corresponding referencing column in matching rows of the child table to be set to null.
:*ON UPDATE SET DEFAULT: Any change to a referenced column in the referenced table causes the corresponding referencing column in matching rows of the referencing table to be set to its default value.
:*ON UPDATE RESTRICT: It is prohibited to change a row of the parent table if that row has any matching rows in the child table. The point in time when checking occures can be deferred until COMMIT.
:*ON UPDATE NO ACTION (the default): It is prohibited to change a row of the parent table if that row has any matching rows in the child table. This holds true in ALL cases, even if checking is deferred (see next chapter).

If ON DELETE or ON UPDATE are not specified, the default action NO ACTION will occur. In some systems the NO ACTION is implemented in the sense of the RESTRICT option.

An Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
CREATE TABLE t1_t2 (
  ...
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_fk_1 FOREIGN KEY (t1_id) REFERENCES t1(id)
                        ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE RESTRICT,
  ...
);
&lt;/source&gt;

Hint 1: The concept of updating Primary Keys is controversial.
 
Hint 2: Not all DBMS support all options.

== IMMEDIATE / DEFERRED ==
There is an additional option to decide at what point in time the evaluation of the Foreign Key definition shall occur. The default behaviour is to check it with each UPDATE and DELETE command. The second possibility is deferring the check until the end of the transaction, which is the COMMIT command. The purpose of this deferring is to put applications in the position to modify parent tables '''before''' child tables (which may be helpful if they utilize [[w:Hibernate_(Java)|Hibernate]]).

To define this option the constraint definition must be extended by the key words [NOT] DEFERABLE, which are pre- or postfixed by INITIALLY IMMEDIATE (the default) or INITIALLY DEFERRED to specify the initial state after the CREATE TABLE point in time. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
CREATE TABLE t1_t2 (
  ...
  CONSTRAINT t1_t2_fk_1 FOREIGN KEY (t1_id) REFERENCES t1(id)
                        ON UPDATE CASCADE  DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE
                        ON DELETE RESTRICT DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED,
  ...
);
&lt;/source&gt;

Hint: MySQL does not support the DEFERRABLE option, but the Foreign Key checking can be activated and deactived dynamically by 'SET foreign_key_checks = 0/1;'

== The Chicken-Egg Problem ==

Sometimes applications run into cyclic dependencies: Table A contains a reference to table B and vice versa, e.g.: A table ''team'' contains the columns ''id'', ''team_name'' and ''team_leader'' (which is an id to a player) and the table ''player'' contains the columns ''id'', ''player_name'' and ''team_id''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
CREATE TABLE team (
  id               DECIMAL,
  team_name        VARCHAR(50),
  team_leader      DECIMAL,      -- ID of a player
  CONSTRAINT team_pk             PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE player (
  id               DECIMAL,
  player_name      VARCHAR(50),
  team_id          DECIMAL,
  CONSTRAINT player_pk           PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

ALTER TABLE team   ADD CONSTRAINT team_fk   FOREIGN KEY (team_leader) REFERENCES player(id);
ALTER TABLE player ADD CONSTRAINT player_fk FOREIGN KEY (team_id)     REFERENCES team(id);
&lt;/source&gt;

So far, so bad. When the first team-row shall be inserted, the player-row is missed. When the player-row is inserted first, the team-row is missed.

As we have seen above, there is a DEFER option. Using this option the FK-constraints must be defined such that they are not evaluated immediate with the INSERT commands. They shall be evaluated after all INSERTs at the COMMIT point in time.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- Throw the above definitions away ...
ALTER TABLE team   DROP CONSTRAINT team_fk;
ALTER TABLE player DROP CONSTRAINT player_fk;
-- ... and use DEFERRABLE
ALTER TABLE team   ADD  CONSTRAINT team_fk   
                        FOREIGN KEY (team_leader) REFERENCES player(id) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;
ALTER TABLE player ADD  CONSTRAINT player_fk
                        FOREIGN KEY (team_id)     REFERENCES team(id)   DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we can insert data in any sequence (don't miss to deactivate [[Structured_Query_Language/COMMIT_and_ROLLBACK#AUTOCOMMIT|AUTOCOMMIT]]).

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
--
INSERT INTO team   (id, team_name,   team_leader) VALUES (1, 'Wild Tigers',  1);
INSERT INTO player (id, player_name, team_id)     VALUES (1, 'Johnny Crash', 1);
-- No checking of Foreign Keys up to here
COMMIT;   -- Commit includes the check of Foreign Keys
&lt;/source&gt;

== DROP TABLE / TRUNCATE TABLE ==

Foreign Keys have implications to [[Structured_Query_Language/Drop_Table|DROP TABLE]] and [[Structured_Query_Language/TRUNCATE|TRUNCATE TABLE]] commands. As long as a Foreign Key refers a parent table, this table cannot be dropped (remove structure and data) or truncated (remove data only). This holds true even if there is no actual row refering any row in the parent table - the existence of the Foreign Key is sufficient to refuse DROP and TRUNCATE.

To use DROP or TRUNCATE it is necessary to drop the constraint first.

Hint: Some implementations offer a DISABLE/ENABLE command to deactivate constraints temporarily.


== Exercises ==

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Is it possible that the parent table of a FK-constraint contains 1 row and the child table is empty?
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
Yes. Parents without children are absolutly normal.
}}

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Is it possible that the child table of a FK-constraint contains 1 row and the parent table is empty?
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
Yes. Although the main purpose of FK-constraints is the prevention of children without parents (orphans), this situation may occur.&lt;br /&gt;If the column of the child row contains the NULL value, this row relates to no parent row&lt;br /&gt;because 'null = &lt;any value&gt;' evaluates always to UNKNOWN and never to TRUE, even if that &lt;any value&gt; is the NULL value.
}}

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Create a table ''genealogy'' which stores information about people and their anchestors. The columns are: id, first_name, last_name, birth_name, father_id, mother_id.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE genealogy (
  id             DECIMAL                           PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name     VARCHAR(100),
  last_name      VARCHAR(100),
  birth_name     VARCHAR(100),
  father_id      DECIMAL,
  mother_id      DECIMAL
);
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Extend the table ''genealogy'' by two FK-contraints such that the columns 'father_id' and 'mother_id' refer to other rows of this table.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE genealogy ADD CONSTRAINT gen_fk_1 FOREIGN KEY (father_id) REFERENCES genealogy(id);
ALTER TABLE genealogy ADD CONSTRAINT gen_fk_2 FOREIGN KEY (mother_id) REFERENCES genealogy(id);
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Insert some data into 'genealogy', e.g.: data from your personal family.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- For the first rows store NULL in 'father_id' and 'mother_id'!
INSERT INTO genealogy (id, first_name, last_name, birth_name, father_id, mother_id)
               VALUES (1,  'Mike',     'Miller',  'Miller',   null,      null);
INSERT INTO genealogy (id, first_name, last_name, birth_name, father_id, mother_id)
               VALUES (2,  'Eve',      'Miller',  'Summer',   null,      null);
INSERT INTO genealogy (id, first_name, last_name, birth_name, father_id, mother_id)
               VALUES (3,  'Marry',    'Dylan',   'Miller',   1,      2);
INSERT INTO genealogy (id, first_name, last_name, birth_name, father_id, mother_id)
               VALUES (4,  'Henry',    'Dylan',   'Dylan',    null,      3);
COMMIT;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

In the spirit of wiki's, contributing is at the heart of all knowledge here. With every contribution does this book get better and more diverse. To contribute, all you need to do is follow the conventions listed below.

== Definitions ==
&lt;!--
=== Definition or glossary pages ===
Definitions in a particular subject should be found on a page of their own, for example:

 IB/Group 4/Computer Science/'''Definitions'''

i.e.

 IB/''Group''/''Subject''/'''Definitions'''

The definitions page should be ordered alphabetically using a alphabetic table of contents. A standard template for definition pages is:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{DISPLAYTITLE:Definitions}}{{CompactTOC8}}[[Category:IB/Definitions]]
===A===
===B===
===...===
===Y===
===Z===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=== Adding definitions ===
To add a definition to the definition page, simply use the following markup:

 &amp;#123;&amp;#123;IB/Define|'''Term'''|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''The full definition of the term.'''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;#125;&amp;#125;

Notice that inside the definition there are html tags for &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This is important in abstracting the definition for later display.

The new definition markup will produce something along the lines of:
{{IB/Define|Term|&lt;onlyinclude&gt;The full definition of the term.&lt;onlyinclude&gt;}}

=== Using definitions ===
To display a definition in the body of some text you can use the following:
 &amp;#123;&amp;#123;IB/Definition|namespace|'''Term'''|float&amp;#125;&amp;#125;

The &lt;code&gt;namespace&lt;/code&gt; of the definition is an important attribute. It points the template to the correct definitions page, and for this reason it is the first attribute. The namespace must be the path to the subject, i.e. &lt;code&gt;''group''/''subject''&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;'''Term'''&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;u&gt;case sensitive&lt;/u&gt; and represents the definition found on the definition page. The &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; is optional and allows you to choose where the definition boxes lies; either on the &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;.

For example, this:

 &amp;#123;&amp;#123;IB/Definition|Group 4/Computer Science|Arithmetic/Logic Unit (ALU)&amp;#125;&amp;#125;

produces:

{{IB/Definition|Group 4/Computer Science|Absolute path}}
--&gt;

== Criteria ==
== Questions ==
== Examples ==
== Extensions ==
== Templates ==
== New subjects ==

When starting a new subject book, there is a simple format for the book title. Every subject apart from TOK belongs to a group. Naturally, therefore, the subject will belong to its group in this wikibook. A subject that belongs to group 4 will be called &lt;code&gt;'''IB/Group 4/Subject'''&lt;/code&gt; where &quot;Subject&quot; is obviously the name of the subject, e.g. &quot;Biology&quot;. The reason for this url (&lt;nowiki&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/IB/Group 4/Subject&lt;/nowiki&gt;) is that it automatically creates a navigation tool at the top of the wikibooks, allowing the student to navigate back to the Group 4 page and finally back to IB Wikibooks home page. 

=== Subject page template ===

The following is a template that can be used when creating a new subject page. '''X''' represents the group that the subject belongs to, and must be filled out accordingly. Notice how there is room for different topics and that they too fall under the subject url we spoke about earlier.

 &amp;#123;&amp;#123;IB/BookTitle|'''Subtitle title'''&amp;#125;&amp;#125;
 == Course content == __NOTOC__
 === &amp;#91;&amp;#91;/'''Some Topic'''|'''Some Topic'''&amp;#93;&amp;#93; ===
 &amp;#123;&amp;#123;:IB/Group X/'''Subject title'''/'''Some Topic'''/'''Sub-topic'''|transcludesection=Topics&amp;#125;&amp;#125;
 
 === &amp;#91;&amp;#91;/'''Another Topic'''|'''Another Topic'''&amp;#93;&amp;#93; ===
 &amp;#123;&amp;#123;:IB/Group X/'''Subject title'''/'''Another Topic'''/'''Sub-topic'''|transcludesection=Topics&amp;#125;&amp;#125;
 
 == Supplementary ==
 &amp;#123;&amp;#123;Multicol&amp;#125;&amp;#125;
 === Exams ===

 &amp;#123;&amp;#123;Template:International_Baccalaureate&amp;#125;&amp;#125;

=== Subject pages ===

You will notice that in the subject page each topic ''includes'' the topic page. This way each topic's sub-topics and contents is kept separate from the main subject page and allows for easier modifications. Here you can use this template for the topic page which would reside with a url similar to '''IB/Group X/Subject/Topic''' -- all you need to do is fill in the respective parts. There is a standard section that all students should address and then a Higher level option that is placed in its own separate box.

HI, I've noticed you mention Lanier and I think what he says really applies to what we have been writing about in our [[Digital Media and Culture Yearbook 2014/Chapter 5: Crowdsourcing|Examples and Applications]] section. We've discovered that indeed the collective can be brilliant, people working in collaboration and towards the same aim allows for amazing accomplishments. So far, we have only discussed the collective being 'stupid' in an example where crowdsourcing was used to hunt for the potential [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon_bombings Boston Marathon Bombings] suspects and lead to false accusations from the online community. I'm wondering whether you plan to write about any other negative examples that we could collaborate on or discuss in relation to crowdsourcing?  [[User:Rkmraf|Rkmraf]] ([[User talk:Rkmraf|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rkmraf|contribs]]) 20:53, 1 April 2014 (UTC)


Hi, I am also from the Crowdsourcing group and was wondering if it'd be alright with everyone that add a link to here from our page. It goes really well with our material and I think we could both draw on each other's info to make stronger pages. Cheers!

Hi, Rkmraf, I'm not sure if we have anymore negative examples, but I'm sure we could look for some then collaborate with you! Everything links together anyway, so I'm sure we will be able to discuss it in relation to crowdsourcing.

::I figure that Cognitive Surplus concerns, by and large, the creative (thus positive) contributions from people since it's the constructive use of time, as you have said, to create value. This is why there seems to be very little negativity surrounding the topic. I have read that this is one of the criticisms of Shirky's book however. Of particular interest was this short response to The New York Times review of the book: '[http://buzzmachine.com/2010/08/07/bad-things-could-happen/ Bad Things Could Happen]', it may be worth exploring the ''bad'' or the not-so-great side of Cognitive Surplus on the Internet. Hope you find it somewhat interesting! [[User:Rkmraf|Rkmraf]] ([[User talk:Rkmraf|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rkmraf|contribs]]) 18:10, 2 April 2014 (UTC)


Hi, Kylie, yes that would be absolutely fine to add a link, it's a great idea! [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 09:01, 2 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

{{quote|The Spanish Civil War of 1936 to 1939 was a class war, and a culture war. Competing visions of Spanish identity were superimposed on a bitter struggle over material resources, as the defenders of property, religion and tradition took up arms against a Republican government committed to social reform, devolution, and secularisation.|Frances Lannon, ''The Spanish Civil War''}}

{{quote|'A civil war is not a war but a sickness,' wrote Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. 'The enemy is within. One fights almost against oneself.' Yet Spain's tragedy in 1936 was even greater. It had become enmeshed in the international cibvil war, which started in earnest with the Bolshevik revolution.|From Antony Beevor, ''The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936−1936'', 2006}}

The Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936 after more than a century of social, economic and political division. Half a million people died in this conflict between 1936 and 1939.

== Long-term causes of the Spanish Civil War: political instability (1920−1931) ==
In the 19th century, Spain had struggled between periods of conservatism and liberalism.

== Long-term causes of the Spanish Civil War: political instability (1920−1931) ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Long-term causes of the Spanish Civil War: political instability (1920−1931)}}}|Long-term causes of the Spanish Civil War: political instability (1920−1931)|
* Struggle between conservatism and liberalism.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
=== Weakness of government ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Weakness of government}}}|Weakness of government|
* 1871 onwards Spain was a constitutional monarchy with a parliament that retained little power.
* Political control shifted between the wealthy oligarchs and their various cliques.
* Two main parties, Conservatives and Liberals, with very little difference between them.
* Elections were rigged or decided in private.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== The role of the Spanish Army ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The role of the Spanish Army}}}|The role of the Spanish Army|
* Army had powerful political position due to imperial past.
* It intervened in politics if a crisis occurred to defend its interests.
* It was unpopular, had a reputation for brutality, and was expensive and required heavy taxes.
* It was ineffective, as proven by the loss of the Spanish Empire during the 19th century, the American war in 1898, and the struggle to keep Morocco between 1906 to 1926.
* It was too big with too many officers and overly middle class.
* Army was conservationist, traditional, nationalistic and 'Africannistas.'
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== The role of the church ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The role of the church}}}|The role of the church|
* Catholic church was rich and powerful, with guaranteed role in education and the economy.
* Its wealth was used to gain political and social influence.
* It used its power for economic conservatism and to oppose modernising and liberal forces.
* Defended the upper class as many of the clergy were aristocrats, who helped fund.
* In many urban areas and rural areas there were protests against the church.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
=== Economic causes ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Economic causes}}}|Economic causes|
* Spain was mainly an agricultural economy, and it was inefficient, thus not providing sufficient food and its work was seasonal.
* Most lived in abject poverty, with an enormous gap between rich and poor.
* Rioting and disorder often broke out in the countryside, with the Civil Guard deployed to ruthlessly repress.
* No support from Church made some groups support the anarchists who argued for land redistribution.
* Many small landholders were conservative, resisted socialist/anarchist ideas, and were exploited by the Catholic Agrarian Federation who provided support for their beliefs, only to later support Franco.
* There was a need for modernisation and reform, and was limited by endemic poverty.
* Workers in twos faced low wages, long hours, unregulated working conditions, poor housing, and little welfare provision.
* This situation led to a growth in trade unionism, which, however, failed to achieve anything substantial. 
* The workers' political parties had no real political power, with no legal means and violent uprisings.
* Spain's neutrality during WWI facilitated a short period of economic boom, however the increase in exports only increased inflation and shortages.
* By 1920s, there were major economic problems.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== The role of regions ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The role of regions}}}|The role of regions|
* Tension created by ongoing struggle between centralist state of Catalonia and Basque provinces, which wanted decentralisation and independence.
* The two regions had their own languages, cultures, economies and churches.
* Primo de Rivera took back the self-governing rights of Catalonia, and separatists forces supported the Republican movement that overthrew Alfonso in 1931
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== Political opposition ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Political opposition}}}|Political opposition|
* Liberal movement achieved little in opposing conservative forces, though remained a political force and supported the revolution that ousted the King in 1931.
* Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE) had grown in rural areas but had minimal impact.
* General Union of Workers (UGT) was more visible in organising strikes/protests in rural areas.
* Following Bolshevik revolution, Communist Party emerged.
* Anarchists demanded land redistribution; popular with peasants.
* Anarchists argued for revolutionary methods and to boycott democratic processes.
* More extreme anarchists (FAI) perpetrated bombings and assassinations. 
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== The fall of the monarchy and the establishment of the Second Republic ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The fall of the monarchy and the establishment of the Second Republic}}}|The fall of the monarchy and the establishment of the Second Republic|
* Post WWI defeat and depression put pressure on King Alfonso XIII, and after 12 unsuccessful governments, a coup was thrown (1931, General Primo de Rivera).
* De Rivera tried to establish authoritarian right-wing regime; started infrastructure programmes for railways, roads, electrification, irrigation.
* Ended war in Morocco in 1925.
* All his efforts created massive debt and was not good when Wall Street Crashed.
* Resigned, and after municipal electrons in April, there was support for San Sebastian Pact (republicans, liberals, socialists, Catalans) coalition.
* 'Velvet revolution' occurred and Second Republic was established as King went into voluntary exile.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Short-term causes of the Spanish Civil War: political polirisation ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Short-term causes of the Spanish Civil War: political polirisation}}}|Short-term causes of the Spanish Civil War: political polirisation|
* Between 1931 and 1936 Spain became polarised due to the long-term structural problems and clear divisions.
* Paul Preston: &quot;no-one, except a tiny minority on the lunatic fringe on the extreme right or left, believe that Spain's problems could be solved only by war.&quot;
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
=== The Left Republic (April 1931−November 1933) ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The Left Republic (April 1931−November 1933)}}}|The Left Republic (April 1931−November 1933)|
* When Manuel Azaña became president he declared a &quot;democratic republic of workers of all classes.&quot;
* Key issue of tension before 'velvet revolution' in 1931 was the church's power.
* Azaña removed powers from the Church, prevented its control in education, and state payments to the clergy stopped.
* Army also affected; Azaña offered early retirement and closed military academies - this all backfired as those who remained where hard-core conservatives, nationalists, and Africanistas.
* Depression exacerbated the economic problems; agriculture prices were falling, wine and olive exports fell, peasant unemployment rising, industry output fell by as much as a half (steel).
* In 1932, law allowed estates to be taken over and redistributed to peasants, however it was expensive and ineffective; only 7,000 families benefited by 1933.
** Right wing saw all this as threat and similar to Soviet style system.
* Government introduced Assault Guard to increase left-wing military force to deal with civil unrest and violence.
* Both the left and right were rising against the slow pace of change, however these were suppressed as the army were loyal.
* Catalonia given its own parliament, some law-making powers, and dual control over education.
** Right-wing saw this as a threat and the first step to break-up Spain.
* Each reform was perceived as an attack on right-wing groups, causing new groups to protect against these changes.
* Political divisions increased under Second Republic.
* Historians see the land reforms as the central failing of the government in this period, however Paul Preston argues right-wing were never going to give Azaña a choice.
* Azaña lost left-wing, working-class support and resigned in 1933 after government guards 'smoked out' anarchists, killing 25.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
=== The Right Republic (November 1933−February 1936) ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The Right Republic (November 1933−February 1936)}}}|The Right Republic (November 1933−February 1936)|
* Republic swung right wing, members of CEDA (largest party) became war ministers.
* These two years are known as the &quot;black years&quot; as right-wing systematically tried to reverse everything; church regained power, education, and land programme was halted.
* Catalonia declared itself independent when CEDA joined government, but autonomy was suspended after Astrurian miners' uprising 1934.
* Historians argued that valiont suppression of left uprising created likelihood for civil war.
* Right lost support from Basques.
* Caballero suggested CEDA was Spanish Nazi party, and seek solution to Soviet-style Spain.
* Gil-Robles demanded shift to authoritarian approach of control, which led to ...

=== The Popular Front (February−July 1936) ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The Popular Front (February−July 1936)}}}|The Popular Front (February−July 1936)|
* February 1936, 'Popular Front' was an anti-fascist pact made up of various left-wing groups including socialists and communists.
* Identical front as Stalin's policy in 1935.
* For many, it was final attempt to uphold democracy and peace, others associated it with Stalin and extreme communism.
* Government wanted to restore reforms of 1931-33 regime; political prisoners released.
* Caballero's socialists did not join government and right did not accept restoration of old reforms.
* Increase in violence in countryside as anarchists encourage peasants to seize land.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Immediate causes of the Spanish Civil War ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Immediate causes of the Spanish Civil War}}}|Immediate causes of the Spanish Civil War|
* Military officers began planning a coup as soon as Popular Front gained power
* Catalyst of coup was the murder of popular CEDA leader on 13 July 1936.
* Azaña knew about the coup and moved key military figures to remote posts.
* When details about the coup were discovered, it was made a day earlier on the 17th of July, from Morocco.
* Spread to mainland, took northern Spain and parts of Andalusia.
* Rising failed to take main industrial areas, or Madrid.
* Half of the army remained loyal to Republic, coup technically unsuccessful.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== The course of the Spanish Civil War ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The course of the Spanish Civil War}}}|The course of the Spanish Civil War|
* With assistance of Nazi Germany, Franco airlifed 24,000 Spanish troops from Africa to Spain, using a policy of terror has the main force against Madrid.
* Coup aimed to crush the 'left revolution,' but actually politicised and radicalised many Spaniards towards the left.
* Supports of the Republican regime (1936) were 'Loyalists,' and rebels called themselves 'Nationalists.'
* Workers supported Republic, and middle, upper class and the church supported Nationalists.
* Nationalists did make some progress, but the Republic controlled major cities, key industrial areas, Spain's gold reserves, and important elements of the military (air force and navy).
* Nationalists, slowly, pushed backed the Republic.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Why did the Nationalists win the Spanish Civil War? ==
=== Republican weaknesses ===
==== Political disunity ====
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Political disunity}}}|Political disunity|
* Republicans were politically divided and subscribed to different ideologies; between the Communists and Socialists who both believed the 'revolution' should be postponed until after the war and the Anarchists who argued the war can only be won through a revolution.
* Historians argue that the Anarchists' 'revolution from below' added a crucial hurdle for the Republic to regain centralised control, with more influence in Madrid and Valencia. 
* War increased in popularity with communists; July 1936 40,000 members, October 1937 400,000 members.
* Republic had clear foreign support from USSR.
* Communists wanted victory in war, anarchists wanted revolutionary regime.
* Communists used 'terror' tactics.
* Four days of street fighting in Barcelona 1937 - communists and socialists versus the anarchists illustrated the lack of unity.
* After May Days (see above), the Worker's Party of Marxist Revolution took up a authoritarian regime. 
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== Military problems ====
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Military problems}}}|Military problems|
* Lacked strong military and no unified command.
* Anarchists and communists would not work together.
* Basques refused to be led be a central command structure and would not permit their forces outside of their own territory.
* Loyal army forces were not trusted by the Republic.
* Military fought series of local battles instead of overall campaign and this meant they could not be supported by the airforces, or to sustain an offensive campaign.
* Only until end of 1939 that Republicans started to replace militias with 'Popular Army'.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== Economic problems ====
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Economic problems}}}|Economic problems|
* Areas under the anarchists were the industries, public utilities and transport - these were taken over by workers' committees, however they were unable to meet the demands of the war.
* Historians argue that this was not due to a badly run government but due to the war, however the government is partially to blame.
* Production fell by two-thirds between 1936 to 1939, with many food and raw material shortages.
* Inflation was a problem; rose 300% during the war.
* The Non-Intervention Committee (NIC) was set up by France and Britain in 1936.
** Prevented an influx of support for warring parties in Spain, making the Republic lose all credit and USSR was the only willing trader.
* Paul Preston: communist control ultimately improved the situation by centralising control, but too late to save Republic.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== Foreign assistance ====
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Foreign assistance}}}|Foreign assistance|
* Role of foreign aid was exaggerated, but aid given to Republic was far less than that of the Nationalists.
* Republic's main ally was USSR, who saved them and enabled it to fight the civil war by supplying aircraft (1,000) and tanks (750), but the Republic had to pay for this.
* No Soviet troops were sent.
* International Brigades were another ally, organised by Soviet Comintern, with 35,000 volunteers sent to fight in Spain.
** Had very little overall impact, only in Madrid.
* 1938, Soviets withdrew support and International Brigades went home, major blow for Republic.
* France sent aid initially, but stopped when it joined the NIC - this was driven by anti-communist sentiments.
* Francisco J .Romero Salvadó (on NIC): &quot;preserved consensus [in France] and [avoided] confrontation with Germany and Italy.&quot;
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== Nationalist strengths ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|X}}}|X|
* 
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
==== Political unity ====
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Political unity}}}|Political unity|
* 1936, Nationalists almost dived as Republics; but had a common aim of overthrowing the government.
* Franco assumed political and military control and became head of government and head of state.
** Due to his position in command of the Army of Africa because important German aid came through him.
* Merged two parties into the Spanish Traditionalist Phalanax (FET).
* Franco used a mixture of propaganda and terror in areas under his control.
** Historians argue that Soviet involvemenet led to this, however others suggest it was power and authority gained during the war.
* Supported by the church which denounced atheist communism and called for a crusade to protect Christian civilisation.
* Nationalistic politics of Franco were not undermined by foreign support from Germany or Italy.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== Military unity ====
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Military unity}}}|Military unity|
* Nationalists had similar problems to the Republicans with regard to 'columns' of militias, however these were quickly put into a regular army unit.
* The Army of Africa fought for the Nationalists and were the most effective force in the Civil War.
* Had unified command and Franco's leadership was accepted by other generals and right-wing parties.
* Italian forces under Nationalist command.
* Successful in pushing on and winning offensives, and adopted effective defensive tactics.
* Had sound communications, and equipped the growing army. 
* Franco's concern for his troops ensured the majority were obedient.
* Franco was a sound military and political leader.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== Economic advantage ====
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Economic advantage}}}|Economic advantage|
* Business communist supported Nationalists; could buy supplies.
* By September 1936, Nationalists in control of main food-producing areas.
* 1937, in control of main industrial areas.
* Benefited from International trade, with the USA giving about $700 million credit to Nationalists.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== Foreign assistance ====
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Foreign assistance}}}|Foreign assistance|
* Hugh Thomas: conflict 'became an international crisis whose solution was decided by external circumstances.'
* Rebels benefited from more aid, which were better quality than those of the Republicans, and had continuous supply.
* German's airlifted Moroccan soldiers and sent 10,000 troops, 800 aircraft, 200 tanks. 
* Italians sent 70,000+ troops, 750 planes, 800 aircraft, 200 tanks.
* Portuguese sent 20,000 troops.
* All aid allowed Nationalists to fight, and gave them air dominance.
* Most of Nationalist army was Spanish, and was modern and equipped.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Overview: foreign intervention ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Overview: foreign intervention}}}|Overview: foreign intervention|
* Foreign intervention lengthened and intensified the war.
* It meant Spanish issues were submerged by wider ideological battles taking place in Europe.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
=== Britain ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Britain}}}|Britain|
* Feared the war would become a general European conflict so set up the NIC.
* However, 3 key members of the NIC ignored the NIC.
* Britain's not interventionist policies were limited and generally supported the Nationalists.
* December 1936, signed a trade agreement with Nationalists to allow for trade.
* Britain did not want to damage relations with Italy or Portugal.
* Spain was sacrificed to the policy of appeasement like Czechoslovakia.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== France ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|France}}}|France|
* Support for Republic was inconsistent, and reflected complexity of its position towards the war.
* French did not want a right-wing border (joining Italy and Germany), but French politics were also polarised, fearing a revolt if it fully supported Spain.
* France was reliant on Britain, which was anti-Republic for its foreign policies.
* France restricted themselves to humanitarian assistance.
* Republic would have benefited from France as it was on its border.
* The Republic's reliance on the Soviet polarised politics and associated it with 'Soviet communism.'
* France did not stop citizens joining the International Brigades, which was organised in France, just like the coordination of Soviet aid.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== USSR ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|USSR}}}|USSR|
* Support not just because of ideological reasons.
* Emergence of another fascist state in Europe would strengthen Hitler's position - threat to Stalin.
* Republic victory could panic Britain and France into an alliance with Hitler.
** Wanted to form an alliance with Britain and France to ''contain'' Hitler.
* Stalin originally welcomed the NIC, but Germany and Italy's treatment of NIC, Stalin withdrew in October 1936.
* Some historians argue that Franco protracted the war to enhance his power, but Stalin had a tendency to drag fighting out.
* Drained resources from Germany, making it less likely to turn into a general war.
* Stalin withdrew support in June 1938, as the Republic seemed to be losing and Western democracies were appeasing fascist dictaros.
* Stalin wanted to create a block to resist Hitler ended with Czechoslovakia being blocked at Munich agreement, September 1938.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== Germany ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Germany}}}|Germany|
* Germany not ready for general European war and was cautious when rebels appealed for help.
* Hermann Göring decided to support rebels, as he and Hitler wanted to stop the spread of communism, and wanted to test out the Luftwaffe.
* Economic and strategic benefits; raw materials (iron) could be gained, and could hamper Anglo-French maritime communications.
* Hitler thought the war would not last long, committed limited aid.
* Ignored NIC, even though it was a member.
* Germany played a crucial military role at critical times and other governments deterred from getting involved due to its presence.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== Italy ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Italy}}}|Italy|
* Gave most assistance as Mussolini was anti-comminist/-socialist and democratic outlook, he wanted to enhance his influence in Mediterranean, and a fascist fictory would weaken France and prevent French left-wing influence.
* Another fascist power would encircle France, pressurising French colonies in North Africa.
* Contributed many planes, tanks, weapons, bombers, and submarines.
** Historians argue that despite massive troop support, its most effective support was air and naval.
* Italy ignored membership of NIC.
* Relationship between Italy and Germany were cemented in Spain.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== Portugal ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Portugal}}}|Portugal|
* Only foreign force not compromised by membership of NIC.
* Sent 20,000 troops and fundamental supplier of rebels in the south-west.
* Provided a base for communications.
* Britain's long-term alliance with Portugal made the British reluctant to count its support for Nationalists.
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== The nature of the Spanish Civil War ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|The nature of the Spanish Civil War}}}|The nature of the Spanish Civil War|
* For foreign powers it was limited, for the Spanish it was total civil war.
* Propaganda was used to dehumanise the enemy. 
* Atrocities were common.
* The targeting of civilians was a premonition of what was to come in WWII - no lines drawn between civilian and combatant.
* Some cases, cavalry charges proved effective, such as in Teruel in February 1938.
* Other case, such as the crushing of Republican offensives in 1938 to 1938 with combined arms and air strikes showed the importance of technology.
* Neither side could consistently gain air control.
* Control of sea was important especially for supply routes.
* Battles on land were similar to that of WWI with defense remained easier than attack.
* Casualties were high, with attackers gaining little hand. 
* Blitzkrieg was evolving with application of tanks, artillery, and air bombardment.
* It was not a guerrilla war because, from Antony Beevor, &quot;the conditions for a universal guerrilla war simply did not exist.&quot;
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Effects and results of the Spanish Civil War − Spain ==
=== Human cost ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Human cost}}}|Human cost|

* Patricia Knight: Church's creation of links to worker's movements was an attempt to infiltrate and prevent any resurgent communist groups.
* Use of Catalan, Basque, and Galician languages were forbidden.

}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== Britain and France ===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{#ifeq:{{{transcludesection|Britain and France}}}|Britain and France|
* Spanish civilians who were bombed made it clear that a general European war would witness horrors unlike the scale seen before.
* Poliarised political view of appeasement; some thought warring factions should battle it without without dragging democracies into conflict.

* A. J. P. Taylor: The Spanish Civil War was &quot;without significant effect&quot; in causing WWII.

The prompt will use &lt;code&gt;prompt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;prompt-sh&lt;/code&gt; HTML/CSS classes, and also an explicit &lt;code&gt;font-weight: bolder&lt;/code&gt; CSS style.

== Usage ==

* {{tl|Sh$}}
* {{tlx|Sh$|2=''Prompt text''&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt;}}
* {{tlx|Sh$|2=&lt;code&gt;1=&lt;/code&gt;''Prompt text with a &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; inside''&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt;}}

== Examples ==

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
&lt;!-- style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; border-top: thick solid silver; border-bottom: thick solid silver; width: 100%;&quot;

== Description ==

Mwlist produces a list of [[MediaWiki]] pages present at the specified (&lt;code&gt;--api=&lt;/code&gt;) MediaWiki instance subject to the criteria given.  By default, it lists just the recently changed pages.
&lt;!-- NB: [[w:Man page]]s are not unknown to have whole paragraphs contained within description lists; as MediaWiki markup does not seem to provide a way to express such a structure, plain HTML is used below instead --&gt;

=== Basic options ===

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--api=&lt;var &gt;URI&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Specifies the URI of the MediaWiki instance’s [[mw:API:Main page|API]] ''endpoint'' (example: &lt;code&gt;https:{{SERVER}}/w/api.php&lt;/code&gt;.)  ''Note that this option is currently mandatory.''&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--user=&lt;var &gt;User-name&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Name of the user to log into the MediaWiki instance as.  (The password will be prompted for.)  The default is not to log in.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--debug&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--no-debug&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Enable or disable (default) debugging output.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;-n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--dry-run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--no-dry-run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;These options are provided for the sake of consistency with the other MediaWiki::Tools, and are silently ignored by &lt;code&gt;mwlist&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--max-queries=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;var &gt;N&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Should too many pages match the criteria given, the MediaWiki instance may refuse to return them all within a single response.  Mwlist may then use the MediaWiki API [[mw:API:Query#Continuing queries|“continue”]] facility to request for the remaining pages.  This option specifies the maximum number of queries to perform (including the initial one.)  The default is 1.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--output=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;var &gt;Filename&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Specifies the file to write the list of ids and names of the pages found to.  Using &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;var &gt;Filename&lt;/var&gt; denotes [[w:Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|stdout,]] which is the default for this option.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

=== Criteria ===

Unless specifically noted below, when several of the criteria below are used at the same time, the result will contain all the pages matching ''either'' of the criteria given. 

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--all-pages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--no-all-pages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This criterion matches all the pages on the given MediaWiki instance, as per [[mw:API:Allpages]].  It will be used if the only criterion given is &lt;code&gt;--no-recent-changes&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--all-pages-from=&lt;var &gt;Page-name&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--all-pages-prefix=&lt;var &gt;Page-name-prefix&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;These criteria limit &lt;code&gt;--all-pages&lt;/code&gt; to only list the pages with the names either from the given one (and lexicographically greater) or having the prefix specified, respectively.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--categorized=&lt;var &gt;Category-name&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--embeds=&lt;var &gt;Template-name&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;These criteria match all the pages belonging to a specific category (as per [[mw:API:Categorymembers]]), or transcluding a specific template (as per [[mw:API:Embeddedin]]), respectively.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--recent-changes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--no-recent-changes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This criterion matches all the recently changed pages, as per [[mw:API:Recentchanges]].  It will be used if no explicit criteria are given.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

=== Being nice to the server ===

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--wait=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;var &gt;Min&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;--wait-max=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;var &gt;Max&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order not to interfere with the activity of other users of the MediaWiki instance, Mwlist will wait for &lt;var &gt;Min&lt;/var&gt; to &lt;var &gt;Max&lt;/var&gt; seconds (either of which may be a decimal fraction, such as 4.2) between consecutive requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default values are 4 and 64 (or &lt;var &gt;Min&lt;/var&gt;, if it’s greater), respectively.  The minimum value for &lt;var &gt;Min&lt;/var&gt; is 1, and the minimum value for &lt;var &gt;Max&lt;/var&gt; is &lt;var &gt;Min&lt;/var&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

The follow articles describe the format of various user-editable files used within the Trainz environment.

When creating files for use with Trainz, care should be taken to follow the specified format accurately. Even if a particular deviation from the documented format is permitted by the current game and tools, it may become disallowed in future versions as loaders are updated and validation techniques are improved.


== Reading N3V File Formats ==
If you develop software which reads these file formats, you should accept and ignore minor deviations where feasible, in order to future-proof your software. Base your file reader on the documented format, not the particulars of the current Trainz implementation. It is likely that implementation-specific details will change between Trainz versions, whereas the file formats are typically extended but not often replaced.


== Writing Binary Files ==
There exist a number of binary file formats which are produced by N3V or by N3V-provided utilities and which are not formally documented. We strongly recommend that third-party developers do not write directly ''to'' these formats. N3V does not support any such tools or any files created by these tools. Reading ''from'' these undocumented binary formats is considered harmless but unsupported.


== Copy Protection ==
The use of an N3V binary file format should not be considered as a strong protection mechanism against snooping or modification except where specifically stated otherwise by N3V. Custom binary file formats are used to allow high-performance access to data from within the game environment. Security and obfuscation are neither primary not secondary goals for these formats, and N3V may provide mechanisms which convert from the binary formats back into &quot;common&quot; formats without prior notice. It should be noted that the technical capability of reverse-engineering the contents of a file does not equate to the legal right to modify or distribute said file. Before modifying someone else's content, please seek the permission of the creator. If you are in any doubt as to your rights in this area, please seek advice from a legal professional.

==Containers==
:''For the technical background of Trainz containers, see '''[[Trainz/AM&amp;C/containers]]'''.&lt;br
/&gt;This page lists the ''''''reference pages links'''''' of specific Trainz containers covered by this Wikibook after a brief introduction of their role in the Trainz data model.''
&lt;br&gt;
'''Containers''' are Trainz term for complex {{Wp|data structure}}s containing more than one elemental {{wp|data type|type of data}} but data groups which might be used in more than one of Trainz {{TL|Kinds}}, in and of themselves a 'container', but of a more unique type. 

In one sense, Trainz assets are nothing but a collection of data organized by proper {{TN|E|enumerated codes}} and these containers, including the parent-classed containers known as '''{{TR|Kinds}}''' define the interrelationship and configuration of an asset, and the behavior of the digital model in the {{TN|GUI}} run-time software&amp;mdash;the {{wp|game engine}}. The container is but one element in an assets self-definition as initialized by the asset creator.
&lt;br&gt;
{{TrainzTip|Recall from elementary math:
&lt;tt&gt;{X: A, B, C, ..., xx}&lt;/tt&gt; is read as &quot;The set 'X' of legal values that are one of: list of valid data values.&quot;
}}

==Data organization==
All Trainz data is represented by a key-word and a value. '''Containers''' are identified by a '''unique enumerated key-word''' (identifier) and for a container, all the values within the ''paired curly braces'' &lt;code&gt;'''&lt;tt&gt;'{' and '}'&lt;/tt&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt; are in the abstract, the value of the container key-word. Within, again, all elements are ''paired values'', often again a keyword and a value. 
&amp;nbsp;

Within many containers (or in practice, a sub-container&amp;mdash; see the form, format, and examples at {{TBS|thumbnails}} for an oft seen and easy to understand representation and example) the keyword is a de facto variable (non-enumerated and undeclared, unconstrained) and are usually ''by convention'' represented as a simple integer &lt;tt&gt;{X: 1, 2, 3, ..., nn}&lt;/tt&gt; followed by whitespace and'' 'the value' ''as the right hand column in the config.txt file, which defines the data value.
&amp;nbsp;

These are called'' 'dummy parameters' ''or '' 'dummy key-words','' or'' 'pseudo-keywords' ''and a content creator might easily instead use &lt;tt&gt;{X: A, B, C, ..., xx}&lt;/tt&gt; or  &lt;tt&gt;{X: throttle1, throttle2, throttle3, ..., tt}&lt;/tt&gt;, for in such cases, in all containers in fact, ''the value(s) is (are) being ordered and organized'' to fill a {{TL|KIND}} dependent  physical address in memory, normally part of an {{wp|Array data type|array}} (See {{N3V|http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/Throttle-power_container#Example_throttle-power_container|throttle-power container}} or {{wp|List (abstract data type)|list}} (See the several examples in {{TR|C|thumbnails}}).

&amp;nbsp;  
==Trainz Wikibook containers==
The Trainz Wikibook and the N3V Games TrainzOnline wiki (or Trainz Wiki) have different focus and purpose. The TrainzOnline pages are meant to be a technical specification and reference for the benefit of content creators, and a means of communication of the data needed by the run time software for an asset to operate correctly inside the {{TN|G|Trainz GUIs}}. It serves as a terse guideline to content definitions.
 
Here in the Trainz Wikibook our focus is on providing elementary introductory material through intermediate and some times advanced knowledge&amp;mdash;to imparting understanding, and helping new Trainzers and old have a more verbose exposition of the ins and outs of Trainz. The costs and man-power of a small business struggling to make ends meet constrains the Trainz Wiki, which of necessity must be authoritative. We strive here for the same degree of accuracy, but also for a bigger picture and necessarily have a time lag for some changes introduced in the course of the ever ongoing evolution of Trainz. This product wouldn't have survived without such change, and while it makes it hard to 'catch up', it also makes the Trainz experience an ever improving one.
&amp;nbsp;

When and if we deem a topic needful of additional exposition and lacking a cohesive build up of fundamental knowledge, we amplify the pages of the TrainzOnline Wiki with additional information, explanations, examples and hopefully aid understanding where the stricter terser writing is undesired by the N3V programmers who oversee the Trsinz Wiki. The following is a table of contents for our container pages to date. Below that you will see a recap of ''some key fundamental material'' in the TrainzBaseSpec.
&lt;br&gt;
===Containers TOC===
====Containers that are part of the TBS====

# {{TBS|kuid-table}}
# {{TBS|member-of-groups}}
# {{TBS|obsolete-table}}
# {{TBS|privileges}}
# {{TBS|script-include-table}}
# {{TR|c|thumbnails}}, {{TBS|thumbnails}}
&amp;nbsp;
====Containers not part of the {{TBS}}====

* {{TR|c|queues}} -- industrial and interactive assets
* {{TR|c|volume}} -- Enginespec
* {{TR|c|mesh-table}} -- Fundamental to any 'manifesting' asset, without a mesh, there is nothing to paint with a texture, so nothing to look at. 
&amp;nbsp;

==Kinds list in the TBS==
The TrainzBaseSpec ({{TBS}}) is a comprehensive list of all trainz data model tags and containers which are mandatory ''or optional'' {{BL|in any and all trainz assets}}. The part recapped below lists the KINDs in the Trainz data model, with links duplicating the TOC above, and/or to the N3V Wiki for ease of reference.
* {{TR|K|p=KINDs}} are a special kind of container, for their {{TN|defines}} also include tags which stealthily sneak into the tags hiding in the config.txt files, and so seem not to be contained at all. Defining the {{TR|T|kind}} puts that judgement in jeopardy&amp;mdash;by defining the kind, it is as if a programmer had added an include file in an high level language. One in this case, requiring a manual addition, instead of the text read of a true include file.
* Things which are tags in the KIND define, are also tags in the config file. Grasp that, and half the battle's won.

:''For an introduction to topic, see: [[Trainz/Config.txt files]], for less basic knowledge building see [[Trainz/AM&amp;C/config.txt files|Config.txt file in /AM&amp;C]]}}

This is the more technical coverage of the Trainz {{wp|ini file}} type known as config.txt files.

The '''config.txt''' file is the central descriptor for a Trainz content item. Every content item has a single filed named config.txt in its folder, which determines the name, kind and unique ID of the item, as well as various kind-specific details. All other files used by the content item are located via the config.txt file.

The config.txt file is stored in the {{TR|R|ACS Text Format}}, which in brief defines a keyword and a value paired. Some keywords are aggragate values, in Trainz, corresponding to a {{TR|C|p=container}} holding lists of such data pairs and other containers.
* When hand-editing the file, care must be taken to use correct syntax or the meaning of parts or the entirety of the file may become permanently lost. When content is installed into Trainz, or when it is archived (in [[CDP Format]] or similar) the config.txt file is stored in a machine-optimized binary format. If the content is later extracted using [[/Content Manager/]], the config.txt file is converted back to text format, however any custom formatting or erroneous syntax is already lost and cannot be restored.


==Standard Tags==
A variety of tags are available to all Trainz content items, regardless of the specific asset type. These tags are inherited from the {{TR|K|KIND TrainzBaseSpec}} base asset type, and are described there in detail. These values are:

{{:Trainz/references/TrainzBaseSpec}}
{{Trainz-sect-stub|fix=Place the more technical annotated materials adapted from the N3V wiki here|text=here}}
==Localisation==
:* ''Localisation is'' 'academic-speak' ''for &quot;Internationalization&quot;, or data translations to other languages...''
As the {{TR|R|ACS Text Format}} uses UTF-8 encoding, so non-English text string entries may occur within any string field in the config.txt file, save where proscribed. (For example, the '''username tag''' is supposed to always be English, but language suffixed forms also allow for support of ''multiple locales'' in the regions languages&amp;mdash; and to avoid confusion, the standard string tags which require localisation support effectively allow multiple entries because the run-time software uses the following conventions:

* ''username'' - The content's human-readable name, in American English. The English name for the asset must be present, and is supposed to be defined in English. (Unfortunately, a small number of assets were uploaded without policing of that criteria, so some non-English names are found on the {{TL|DLS}}.
* ''username-cz'' - The content's human-readable name, in Czech.
* ''username-de'' - The content's human-readable name, in German.
* ''username-es'' - The content's human-readable name, in Spanish (Espanol).
* etc.

{{Text-box|1=
The following standard tags support this form of localization:&lt;br/&gt;
'''where XX is the iso two character abbreviation for a language'''. (e.g. de=German, fr=French, it=Italian, etc.)}}
* {{TR|R|TrainzBaseSpec#username|p=username tags}} and {{TBS|username-XX}} tags 
* {{TR|R|TrainzBaseSpec#description|p=description tags}} and {{TBS|description-XX tags}}
* {{TR|R|TrainzBaseSpec#string-table|p=string-table container}} and {{TBS|string-table-XX}} {{TA|container}}s.

==Common Containers==

:* For the technical coverage on this topic, see: [[Trainz/references/config.txt_file|Trainz/references/config.txt file]].

==Introduction==
{{TRS-byline|usr1=Fabartus|aun=fabartus|aid=497853}}&lt;!-- On Trainz/Config.txt_files ---&gt;

This is the introduction to '''[[Trainz/AM&amp;C/config.txt file|Trainz config.txt files]]''', a type of {{wp|ini file}} used to track and initialize literally every asset in the Trainz data definition and database system. 

Younger readers will likely be less familiar with the INI file concept, but the technology is still in use in modern applications, though much of the setup data once ensconced in ini files is now put into Windows registry entries, and the rest is usually hidden away in a folder not normally accessed by the casual Trainz Windows user. A search from the C:\ root for *.ini will find the ini file is still alive and well, even inside the Windows folder and sub-folders, for applications and so there is little mystery that Trainz which antedated Windows 2000 and Windows ME releases, would maintain the technology in use if it serves it well. 

Trainz however, cannot take that registry route for there are over 130,000 built-in assets in a typical Trainz release, and some might double that count&amp;mdash;before adding in free or payware content from the {{TL|Download Station}} or 3rd-party site, and using the registry to record ''even just added content'' would quickly swell the windows registry into behaving with glacial slowness, a result contrary to the idea of historic design goals of the registry which was supposed to make Windows application launches faster and increasing reliability (from the Software support folk's point of view) by hiding various things where the average user couldn't get at them and fiddle with settings. (Yes, Nanny-state thinking!)
&amp;nbsp;
Overall, with the registry now over a decade old, Window process switching does go much faster and applications trust the registry so have been empowered to incorporate less safeguard testing on self-booting operations.
 
&amp;nbsp;
Then there is a second issue, Trainz asset ini files are .txt files, and most Trainz ini files are soon missing&amp;mdash;their very {{TG|root folder}}s are temporary in existence and as a file containing a {{TG|define|data defines}} set, they're component files are often compressed into other partially processed, organized and indexed files (see {{TG|chump files}}) which the Trainz data base uses in the {{TG|run-time}} {{TG|GUI}} modules and {{TL|CM}}. This'' processed 'Asset status' ''is called ''being committed'', meaning the temporary files in a root folder are bundled up and inserted into the Trainz '''A'''sset '''D'''ata '''B'''ase ({{TG|TAD}}) ready for inclusion in a route or session, or further referencing by CM operations such as checking for {{TG|dependencies}} or dependent assets.

{{Trainz-stub|Place the more technical annotated materials adapted from the N3V wiki here}}

==So What's a config.txt file?==
Each asset (or content item) in Trainz starts in a file folder setup and with each part defined by the content creator. Some graphics packages, notably Autodesk's {{wp|3ds Max}} which N3V's developers use and the formerly 'bundled-with-Trainz' simpler game focused {{TG|G|Gmax}} sub-set of 3ds Max liked to use certain sub-folder arrangements and these carry over into Trainz folders organization.

The config.txt file is the glue that holds together the parts of a self-defining 3D graphics model defining and giving instructions for how those files and sub-folders fit together as interpreted by the Auran JET 3.0 graphics engine behind the Trainz virtual worlds.
&amp;nbsp;
 
Various data elements must be defined in a config file, and others are optional. Such data elements are set forth in the {{TL|TrainzBaseSpec}}, a {{TR|Kinds|p=KIND}} classed data collection which may be or must be defined in each Trainz sub-asset. A sub-asset are parts, wheels, Locomotive Cabs, bogeys (trucks), couplers, track attached to an interactive factory and so forth which might be used by numbers of larger assets. The track in the factory or wheels of a freight car (wagon) being two easy to understand examples.

==The Flavor of a Config==
{{TRS-underconstruction}}
The following is a small taste of a config file from an actual locomotive asset engine component file folder. Sounds are parts assets too, and this one connects the sounds (which might be apropos to other locomotives) to the &quot;{{TG|E|engine spec}}&quot; config.txt file which calls this by reference to its {{TG|K|KUID}} &quot;&lt;kuid:32711:100430&gt;&quot; (find below). The engine-spec asset is in it's turn referenced in the locomotive's config.txt file, meaning this asset has both a parent and a grand-parent asset level; and possibly many such associations:
&lt;pre&gt;
username                                &quot;0-4-0T Sounds&quot;

===Mandatory tags and containers===
:Note, this list has been evolving inordinately quickly the past couple of years as Trainz and the MAC computer world interacted. Tags which were optional are now showing up on the TrainzOnline Wiki as being mantatory after trainz-build 3.4, or whatever. Further, the DLS acceptance testing is ahead of Trainz software releases as a rule, so uploaded assets may be bounced back with a requirement such and such a mandatory tag list needs defining. 

The assets elements contained between ''''{'''' and ''''}'''' are inside a ''''''container'''''' or {{TL|Kinds|KINDS}}

=Introduction=

Bradley Birkenfeld is an American banker, formerly employed by a number of Swiss banks, including [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS Union Bank of Switzerland] (UBS) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Suisse Credit Suisse]. He was the first banker to blow the whistle on the widespread tax evasion practices associated with international banking when he cooperated with the Senate, the Department of Justice, and the IRS between 2007 and 2009. Birkenfeld rose to fame when the IRS awarded him $104 million dollars as part of their Whistleblower program for his involvement in their investigation of tax evasion by Americans, which was facilitated by off-shore banks such as UBS. The award represents 26% of the tax money recovered from UBS, and is the highest whistleblower reward up to date &lt;ref&gt;http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/birkenfeld-determination-letter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

The IRS collected over $5 billion in taxes and penalties, and marked a significant step in breaking the longstanding [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking_in_Switzerland#Banking_privacy  Swiss bank laws]. Public confidence in the whistleblower program was shaken as Birkenfeld was sentenced to 40 months in prison for helping Americans evade taxes while still employed by UBS. In a 60 Minutes Interview, Mr. Birkenfeld’s lawyer, Steven Kohn, stated “the day he walks into prison is the day you will lose a generation of whistleblowers.... because no one will blow the whistle!” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6050245n&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Rather than following most of his classmates into the military after graduation, a traditional track at Norwich, Birkenfeld went back to Boston and worked briefly as a bond trader. Then, after a couple of years, he decamped to Switzerland and stayed. He earned an MBA at the American Graduate School of Business, a picturesque little campus nestled between Montreux and Vevey in the Swiss Riviera.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/europe/100724/swiss-banking-secrecy-billionaires&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Career'''

Birkenfeld began his career with State Street as a bonds trader in 1994. He was recruited by Credit Suisse in 1996, where he worked for two years. Subsequently, Birkenfeld moved to Barclay's Bank in 1998, working in their wealth management division. After two successful years at Barclay's, Birkenfeld was recruited by UBS and became a director for their wealth management services, responsible for the North American region&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whistleblowers.org/storage/whistleblowers/documents/Birkenfeld/commutation%20petition%20april%2015th%20final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 2005, after his efforts to gain clarification on an internal UBS memorandum which explicitly prohibited activities in his job description were ignored and all other internal options had been exhausted, Birkenfeld quit his job at UBS &lt;ref&gt;BROWNING, LYNNLEY. As Early as 2005, UBS Executives Were Told of Possible Offshore Violations. Aug 14, 2008.ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2009).&lt;/ref&gt;. Birkenfeld briefly worked for another Swiss wealth investment company, while he began to transfer incriminating evidence and other documents detailing the tax evasion practices he witness and participated in at UBS from Switzerland to a law firm in the United States. Birkenfeld had decided he would blow the whistle on off-shore banking.  In 2007 he sought out the IRS to build a case against banks that facilitated tax evasion, especially UBS, and also to gain whistleblower status. Birkenfeld needed federal protection as a whistleblower to divulge the information that fell under Swiss banking laws. A messy affair followed, as the IRS would not grant him immunity without Birkenfeld providing them with specific information, which in turn, he would only provide under immunity. As a result, Birkenfeld ended his collaboration with the IRS and brought the matter before the Department of Justice (DOJ) and a Senate subcommittee tasked with the investigation of off-shore tax evasion practices by US citizens.  The latter subpoenaed Birkenfeld, so could provide them with specific information of International tax evasion schemes faciliated by UBS&lt;ref&gt;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444017504577645412614237708.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.whistleblowers.org/storage/whistleblowers/documents/Birkenfeld/2007%20contributions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

Birkenfeld was charged by the IRS for assisting tax evasion on a large scale in connection with his largest former client Igor Olenicoff, a real estate billionaire who evaded over $7.2 million in taxes on over $200 million off-shore investments &lt;ref&gt;BROWNING, LYNNLEY. Ex-UBS Banker Pleads Guilty in Tax Evasion. Jun 20, 2008. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2009)&lt;/ref&gt;. The IRS accused Birkenfeld of withholding important information on Olenicoff in their past discussions &lt;ref&gt;http://www.whistleblowers.org/storage/whistleblowers/documents/birkenfeld%20-%20sentencing%20transcript%208.21.09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Meanwhile, Birkenfeld continued to cooperate with authorities as the key informant in their case against the Swiss bank. Although multiple investigators conceded that without Birkenfeld, the IRS and DOJ could have never been able to successfully mount a tax evasion case &lt;ref&gt;http://www.whistleblowers.org/storage/whistleblowers/documents/Birkenfeld/birkenfeld_sentencing_transcript_p12-15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Birkenfeld was tried and sentenced to 40 months in jail&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whistleblowers.org/storage/whistleblowers/documents/birkenfeld%20-%20sentencing%20transcript%208.21.09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Meanwhile, his client Olenicoff pleaded guilty to filing false tax returns, paid a substantial fine, and sued the UBS for giving him incorrect advice regarding his offshore tax claims.

After the verdict against UBS, 33,000 Americans admitted to undeclared overseas accounts, and most took advantage of the IRS Voluntary Foreign Account Disclosures program. The program allowed individuals to avoid public charges by repaying the evaded taxes plus interest. UBS was fined $780 million by the IRS and $200 million by SEC for their illegal operations in the US&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2009/February/09-tax-136.html&lt;/ref&gt;. More importantly, a precedent was set as the US reached an agreement with Switzerland to reveal US client names specifically accused of tax evasion.

In 2012, Mr. Birkenfeld, was awarded $104 million dollars under a special whistleblower reward program instituted by the IRS. The award constituted 26% of the money collected from UBS by the IRS&lt;ref&gt;http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/birkenfeld-determination-letter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Senator Grassley says the potential for the IRS Whistleblower program “is tremendous” arguing that “billions of dollars are paid that would have otherwise been lost to major tax evasion” &lt;ref&gt; http://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/Article.cfm?customel_dataPageID_1502=42397 &lt;/ref&gt;.

=Aftermath=
In 2013 the IRS awarded 122 whistleblowers a total of 53 million dollars after providing tips that led to the recovery of 367 million tax dollars &lt;ref&gt;http://www.howard-brown-solicitor-advocate.com/#!%2453%20Million%20Paid%20to%20Whistleblowers%20in%202013/cwdb/D778285E-2792-4E67-967F-25CBD0C5B903&lt;/ref&gt;. Although this total is less than Birkenfeld's individual award, it is apparent that the whistleblower program has had a measurable level of success since its inception. While it is impossible to determine if Bradley Birkenfeld's actions provided the traction necessary for the program to take off, it seems he did set a positive example for the young program. 

Bradley Birkenfeld's case brought the whistleblower program into the spotlight for the first tine. Since it was established in 2006 as a result of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act the, Bradley Birkenfeld was the first and most prominent example. This success went on to inspire other government agencies to follow suit. In 2011 The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) established their own whistleblower program and recieved 2,766 tips in the first year&lt;ref&gt; http://www.economist.com/node/21562927 &lt;/ref&gt;. These changes will hopefully modify the culture in the financial industry overtime and create a more honest workforce focused on legal activity rather than profit.

=Connections to Professionalism=

===Normalization of Deviance===

[[Professionalism/Diane Vaughan and the normalization of deviance|Normalization of Deviance]] is the practice of accepting an action which by itself is not correct, but through habit, have accepted the action or lack of action as acceptable. Take for example the space shuttle Challenger that was doomed to tragedy by getting too comfortable with poor performing o-rings&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster&lt;/ref&gt;. Over time these small deviations from acceptable risk levels combine to produce a disaster prone operating practice.

In the context of private banking, the industry set a general practice of a necessary &quot;toxic waste&quot; to fuel large profits of having US clients funnel money via non-U.S. regulated accounts - to the tune of 95% of all UBS accounts were undeclared.

According to Birkenfeld, he did not realize that UBS wealth management operations were illegal until 2005 when an internal document detailed the illegal nature of the practices &lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/europe/100724/globalpost-investigation-telling-swiss-secrets-part-4&lt;/ref&gt;. At this moment Birkenfeld fully realized how far UBS had moved away from the safe operating norm and resigned. The difference between the daily operation procedures at UBS and the legal regulations outlined in the document mark a clear representation of Normalization of Deviance. Over the years the internal culture at UBS led to a point where these practices became standard operating procedure and undisputed.

===Bystander Effect===
The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect Bystander Effect] is when in response to a decision, a group chooses to diffuse responsibility from themselves to the group, often taking no action, compared to an individual response.

With a large corporate structure whose bottom line was mainly fueled by large net worth individuals evading taxes on their investments, bankers felt as if the problem was out of their control. If banking practices were exposed, the size of the industry would make it highly unlikely that they would be exposed or personally need to address the problem. As it turned out, only Birkenfeld was jailed for his involvement in the tax evasion practice, mainly because he was the one to expose it. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/business/whistle-blower-awarded-104-million-by-irs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peril of Obedience===
Under the supervision of an authority figure, individuals will cede responsibility for their actions to that of their supervisor despite their individual conscience of the actions they carry out. In 1961, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University Yale University] psychologist [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Milgram Stanley Milgram] set to determine the effect of authority and following orders inspired by the question of following orders three months after the trial of war crimes of Nazi Lieutenant Colonel [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann Adolf Eichmann] began. In [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment his experiment], he discovered that individuals would continue actions as directed despite their own personal convictions against their actions.

In the context of private banking, individual bankers caved to directives from authority to land new high net worth individuals to the bank. With large demands, bonuses, and incentives, bankers felt that they had &quot;no choice&quot; but to keep doing &quot;their job&quot; or else be replaced by someone else who would.

===Cheryl D. Eckard===

Cheryl D. Eckard of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaxosmithkline GlaxoSmithKline] was awarded then-record $96 million in 2010 eight years after her involvement in 2002 to reveal to GSK a serious contamination problem in GSK's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cidra,_Puerto_Rico Cidra], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico Puerto Rico] plant. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/27/glaxosmithkline-whistleblower-awarded-96m-payout&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samy Kamkar===
[[File:Samy_Kamkar.jpg|thumb|Samy Kamkar]]
Samy Kamkar, an independent privacy and security researcher who blends the lines of ethical hacking, has had several efforts in whistleblowing.

After releasing a scripting worm on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySpace MySpace], pleading guilty to a felony of computer hacking, and losing access to a computer for 3 years, Samy demonstrated in 2008 the security weakness in NFC and RFID chips built into new credit cards. 

In 2011, Samy uncovered a potential security flaw in the transmission of individual GPS and Wi-Fi information of mobile devices to their parent companies. This led to a Senate hearing over the efficacy of federal consumer privacy laws with technological advances. &lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samy_Kamkar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/05/10/senate.smartphone.hearing/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=Conclusion=

A professional is:

# A licensed or credentialed member of a recognized profession:  for example a physician, a lawyer, a professor, a clergyman, or a certified P.E. (Professional Engineer). 
# The opposite of an amateur:  an athlete, actor, etc., who is paid for his or her work.
# A dutiful and conscientious employee; for example, an employee who dresses appropriately and who is punctual, courteous and productive.
# A plerker or a master of flow: one who works at one’s excellence such that work is play and challenges are matched with skill

Birkenfeld represents a mix of the professional definitions. On the surface Birkenfeld's actions were the first of its kind in the banking industry. Acting as a whistleblower in an industry riddled with accusations of fraud has been described as courageous. Underneath the surface we will never know Birkenfeld's true motivations for coming forward. Perhaps he saw it as a way to take revenge on UBS, or maybe he saw this as a way to save himself from future prosecution. 

While it does not appear Birkenfeld was plerking while working for UBS as a private wealth management advisor, he did recognize his excellence. When he blew the whistle on the illegal activities of his coworkers and employer, Birkenfeld took a step towards &quot;The Good&quot;. This decision to come forward was first met with jail time and criticism from many of his peers, but later he was rewarded financially. The financial freedom has given him the opportunity to master his flow and invest time and money into areas he is passionate, such as helping with the safety of his hometown Boston&lt;ref&gt; http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2014/04/24/boston-police-electric-bikes/&lt;/ref&gt;.

Overall Birkenfeld's story marks a interesting investigation for professional ethics due to the varying media perceptions of his actions. His tenure at UBS that ended with stories of smuggling undeclared diamonds &lt;ref&gt;http://www.economist.com/node/21562927&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately imprisonment for his actions has sparked debates about the underlying ethics of his actions. Despite these rumors and suspicions, the fact remains that Birkenfeld stood up when nobody else would and set a precedent for ethical actions in the private wealth management industry.

Hey, this is good that we have this page. We can discuss what we need to do/documents to reference/information we should add to the page. I can start finding online journals and sources that will help us! [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 21:19, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

I'm researching the topic now and am writing about Clay Shirky and his concepts, we should come up with an order of what we will write about! 
[[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 14:53, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I've created a new section for Main Theorists, where I think we can highlight certain important things that these people (Shirky, Lanier, etc.) have produced/studied/talked about in regards to CS. This can include Shirky's TED Talk, his book, Lanier's article on DIGITAL MAOISM: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism. Is there anything else we could add to this? [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 16:32, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Hey, should we mention the hive mind?  [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 21:32, 31 March 2014 (UTC)
 
... Never mind.. It's been done now... [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 07:51, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

We should write more about the different  theorists, especially the ones mentioned in today's lecture, as well as their concepts. [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 10:36, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I have almost completed a breakdown of Skirky's TED talk in which I analyse and expand upon much of what he said and the examples he gave. I'd be happy to discuss with anyone who has took a particular interest in the talk about what to include and how we can contribute equally. [[User:LiamHagan94|LiamHagan94]] ([[User talk:LiamHagan94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LiamHagan94|contribs]]) 12:45, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, I agree that taking a look at the other theorists is essential. Lanier and Gauntlett in particular ought to be written about in some detail. I have found the 'further reading' that Greg listed after todays lecture and on that of CS have been very useful re: G&amp;L. [[User:LiamHagan94|LiamHagan94]] ([[User talk:LiamHagan94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LiamHagan94|contribs]]) 12:48, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Shall we delegate tasks for each other to do? And then possibly run them by the other group so we don't overlap their work? Like maybe a some people do the theorists in todays lecture, and others can explained on what's already been put on by the other group, and then the new bits we were talking about adding while in our seminar? Seems like there's enough tasks to go around [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 15:31, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

That's a great idea, we all can take different parts and start working on those. I'll start reading up on the further reading that Liam mentioned there! I'm also happy to help create new sub-categories and organise things on the page.[[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 15:35, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah, that sounds good. What other sub-categories do we need? I think I'm going to expand on the bit about Jaron Lanier.. That bit's looking a tad bare just now... [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 15:38, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Who made the Key Theorists part in the Key Concepts section? Because we can move that to the Main Theorists part to keep things consistant. [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 15:47, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

The other team have discussed using the APA ref system, and I'm relaying that on here too! [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 15:59, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I think Liam is writing about the TED talk, and that'd be great if you expand more on Lanier's section, Laura. Other theorists that we could mention could include Abigail de Kosnik and Tiziana Terranova (both mentioned in the CS lecture) as well as Harold Rheingold, Henry Jenkins, Pierre Lévy, Surowiecki and David Gauntlett (all from today's lecture). [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 16:15, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I'll have my part on the TED talk up ASAP. Fraser has been looking in to it as well so we'll both be contributing to that. It should be completed entirely by tomorrow. Once I'm finished with that I'll look in to Lanier &amp; Digital Maoism if you'd like any assistance with that, Laura. APA is great, I'm glad that's been sorted out. [[User:LiamHagan94|LiamHagan94]] ([[User talk:LiamHagan94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LiamHagan94|contribs]]) 18:28, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

My TED talk analysis is now live so feel free to begin a discussion about whether or not anybody feels as if it needs to be edited or expanded upon in any way. [[User:LiamHagan94|LiamHagan94]] ([[User talk:LiamHagan94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LiamHagan94|contribs]]) 19:47, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Hey guys, just catching up on all of this! Sounds great so far, the page is looking good. I'm going to start researching more into the lessons of Cognitive Surplus and how it has effected people. I will post anything I can find and let me know what you think. [[User:Kate Galbraith|Kate Galbraith]] ([[User talk:Kate Galbraith|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kate Galbraith|contribs]]) 20:51, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm going to start putting the words in the glossary that need defining, that way we can all take a few words each to define. After we have done that we can discuss what needs changed in any of our definitions? [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 09:08, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

... And I will also look at those other theorists! [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 09:09, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm organising the Main Theorists part a bit more by creating categories for Kosnik and Terranova. [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 10:59, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Did some research last night on Cognitive Surplus and I have found a good example of something that has happened quite recently. It is public coming together to join the search for the missing Malaysian plane and is a great example of people using their spare time to help rather than waste time watching TV. Check out the link and let me know if you think it would be relevant in the wikibook! http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2583807/Did-Malaysian-fisherman-missing-flight-MH370-flying-low-Gulf-Thailand.html [[User:Kate Galbraith|Kate Galbraith]] ([[User talk:Kate Galbraith|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kate Galbraith|contribs]]) 13:23, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah, that's a good example! What section would we include that in? [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 13:39, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm thinking of just creating a new section called 'How things have changed' or something like that. Thoughts? [[User:Kate Galbraith|Kate Galbraith]] ([[User talk:Kate Galbraith|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kate Galbraith|contribs]]) 15:06, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

The contents of that link fit perfectly. Since Shirky's TED Talk was entitled 'How Cognitive Surplus Will Change the World', maybe it would be an idea to entitle that section 'How Cognitive Has Changed the World' or something like that. I'm currently looking in to smart mobs and Howard Rheingold as you mentioned Kat, it would be a good idea to add more relevant theorists. Thanks also to whomever added the citation to my TED Talk analysis, that was much appreciated. [[User:LiamHagan94|LiamHagan94]] ([[User talk:LiamHagan94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LiamHagan94|contribs]]) 15:38, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah, I really like that idea Liam. I'm just looking at how to word this section, and what are the most important things to talk about. I think I will focus on what Shirky's idea of change was and then give the example of the Malaysian aircraft. I will post on the wikibook a bit later on and you can see what you think. [[User:Kate Galbraith|Kate Galbraith]] ([[User talk:Kate Galbraith|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kate Galbraith|contribs]]) 16:00, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

That's an interesting example about the Malaysian aircraft. I will go through it and add more references as well as fleshing out some more of the parts. Is there anything specific people would like me to write about as well? I can look up some definations as well.

I'm gathering a list of words for the glossary but there seems to be very little.. I was thinking of putting the words from the main concepts section and stuff, it would just be a more concise definitions in the glossary. Does that sounds okay? [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 17:02, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I've just completed my section of Rheingold and how smart mobs link with the notion of cognitive surplus. Please feel free to edit it or ask me about any part of it if necessary. Your idea for the glossary sounds great, Laura. If I can help in any way just ask.

I don't see anything up yet about the &quot;wisdom of crowds&quot; and Surowiecki so I'm going to research and add some about that in Collective Intelligence if nobody minds [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 19:17, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Also Liam, that's fantastic what you've done on the TED talk. Only now managed to get on a computer so I may add a few things if I see anything. [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 19:21, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah that sounds good... I'm doing the glossary so if there are any words you come across that could go in, let me know, please. [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 19:23, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Sorry guys big post coming up! In the middle of writing this and wanted to know if i'm going along the right lines? 
How Cognitive Surplus has Changed the World.
As Clay Shirky focuses on in his TED talk, civic value or civic engagement is one of the most relevant aspects of Cognitive Surplus. Nowadays, with devices such as the internet, people are able to communicate faster and more often. The idea of sitting on a couch and watching TV all day is less appealing.  More often than not, people are coming round to the idea of using their free time in a positive way, like raising awareness on social networking sites. 
Using the internet as a prime example, it is a simple enough tool to control Cognitive Surplus. The recent Malaysian MH370 Aircraft that went missing on the 8th of March 2014 caused major controversy all over the World. The article “Student posts ‘satellite’ image showing a jet over the jungle as thousands join online search for plane” written by Sam Webb and Richard Shears for the Mail Online proves Shirky’s point of Cognitive Surplus being used in a positive way. The article provides images of potential sightings of the plane and describes the search as an “online community”. Webb and Shears also explain that celebrities have taken to joining in the search and “offering up their suggestions”. 
[[User:Kate Galbraith|Kate Galbraith]] ([[User talk:Kate Galbraith|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kate Galbraith|contribs]]) 19:41, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, do I link the article or is that something that needs to be referenced? [[User:Kate Galbraith|Kate Galbraith]] ([[User talk:Kate Galbraith|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kate Galbraith|contribs]]) 19:53, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

I have posted on the &quot;How Cognitive Surplus has Changed the World&quot; section. Let me know what you think of it and let me know how I need to reference it. Any help would be much appreciated! [[User:Kate Galbraith|Kate Galbraith]] ([[User talk:Kate Galbraith|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kate Galbraith|contribs]]) 20:50, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Could you guys have a look at my piece on James Surowiecki and give me any pointers on referencing it please [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 22:16, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

&quot;Not quite the idealist that Rheingold comes across as with his &quot;smart mobs&quot;, Surowiecki too recognises that &quot;groups are remarkably intelligent&quot; and that even with a disparity in intelligence and knowledge progress can still be made. Shirky's idea of Cognitive Surplus can be seen to flow in tandem with Surowieckie's thoughts due to the fact that society as a group has no linear intelligence and knowledge. Societies knowledge is diverse and independent but much of it specialised. It is this diversity and independence that allows society to produce both &quot;civic&quot; and &quot;communal&quot; values at the same time. Surowiecki puts this down to the fact that &quot;human beings are not perfectly designed decision makers&quot;. Therefore, producing two forms of values.&quot;[[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 22:17, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, where would you say is the best place for me to add it. Under Shirky, or Rheingold? [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 22:18, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Thats good Fraser! I would put it under Shirky cause you've talked about how Surowiecki's thoughts are similar to his. [[User:Kate Galbraith|Kate Galbraith]] ([[User talk:Kate Galbraith|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kate Galbraith|contribs]]) 22:31, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

Done the referencing. Think i've done it properly... [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 09:36, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Liam. In the TED talk do you think we should mention what he says about us now going into an &quot;age of generosity&quot; as both &quot;LOLcats&quot; and Ushahidi are both intrinsically. As Shirky says we don't produce &quot;civic&quot; and &quot;communal&quot; values because our boss wants us to and we are forced to, but instead we do it because we enjoy it? I thought it was worth a wee mention. Also, the day care centre example is quite interesting as it raises the point that there are social constraints which possibly hinder us from producing &quot;civic&quot; values. Please tell me if I got that completely wrong… [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 09:50, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Whoops. *Intrinsically good^ [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 10:01, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

That's a great idea. It would probably fit in best just before the final paragraph of what I wrote on the talk, but that's entirely up to you. [[User:LiamHagan94|LiamHagan94]] ([[User talk:LiamHagan94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LiamHagan94|contribs]]) 10:04, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Fantastic! I'll get on that now. I won't need to reference it will I because you already have? [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 10:06, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Brilliant. No, you shouldn't have to reference it because it's all based on the same thing. [[User:LiamHagan94|LiamHagan94]] ([[User talk:LiamHagan94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LiamHagan94|contribs]]) 10:36, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm filling in a few more definations, do you guys think we should reference the definations? I'm not copying and pasting them from the dictionary or anything, but should they be referenced? [[User:Katmcknight.nitx|Katmcknight.nitx]] ([[User talk:Katmcknight.nitx|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Katmcknight.nitx|contribs]]) 13:23, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I dont think they need to be referenced if its your own words... and what ones are you defining.. cause thats what i am doing just now.. if we split them up we won't find a definition only to discover its been defined. [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 13:31, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm moving the part about copyright from the section on Terranova to the main concepts.

Did you not say to me earlier you had words to go in the glossary, Fraser? You could add those in a define them? Also, since everything seems to be done.. why dont we discuss what parts of the page will be relevant for our presentation? [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 19:13, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Looking at what you've already done you've covered all the ones I talked about I think. I'll have another look and add any if i find them. [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 19:22, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Good idea Laura. I think the majority should be focused on Shirky because it was really him who coined the phrase. We can use the TED talk in the presentation too to add a bit of relief for the rest of the class who i'm sure don't want to listen to us going on for the whole thing! [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 19:34, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Yeah that's a good idea! Plus I would really rather not talk for the whole time, not a fan of presentations. We gonna use a powerpoint? Well actually hold on.. Greg says we take the seminar.. so lets start with what we think makes a good seminar? [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 19:37, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Also... I'm gonna add a little bit to the introduction if you want to add more after that? Means you get to contribute more since you haven't really had the chance... [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 19:41, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I think the page is looking pretty full. Thanks Laura and Kat for doing the definitions. I'm wondering if there is anything to add, but I can't find anything in particular from my notes or from the reading. I went through the 'Further Reading' suggestions from the Cognitive Surplus and Collective Intelligence lectures which Greg listed for something to add but it seems as if we and Team Alpha have took what is most relevant and went in to enough detail with it. I considered a new section on criticisms of CS, but I have only managed to find criticisms of the book, most of which focus on Shirky's writing style and idealism, and not on the idea of CS itself. If anyone has any suggestions of things they would like to add which they would like help with feel free to give me a shout. [[User:LiamHagan94|LiamHagan94]] ([[User talk:LiamHagan94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LiamHagan94|contribs]]) 20:05, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, with regards to the presentation; I, for one, like the idea of a powerpoint presentation purely for the fact that it gives us a visual reference to keep us on track as well as helping to flesh out what we are saying for the rest of the class. Fraser, I agree that it should focus on Shirky; we could talk about the genesis of the idea, how he presents it (TED talk and the book) and what it means to us as media prosumers. (5 points to Ravenclaw for using the word from this weeks lecture.) We could also talk about the theorists we have mentioned as well as Kate's part about how CS has changed the world with some examples. Maybe we could mix it up with a variation of lecturing and class discussion/debate because you don't want to just babble on endlessly as much as you don't want to make the class do all of the work for us. We're week twelve so we have plenty of time to discuss it and make it the best possible presentation we can. [[User:LiamHagan94|LiamHagan94]] ([[User talk:LiamHagan94|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LiamHagan94|contribs]]) 20:14, 3 April 2014 (UTC) 

Yeah, I think its basically been covered. I looked for criticism too but i can't find anything! You'd have thought someone would have wrote something critical on it. I like your idea for the presentation, not too much talking on our part, but not too much free reign for the rest of the class too. I also like your positivity.. Our presentation will be the best!

Seen that there isn't any mention of David M Berry on &quot;creative commons&quot; so currently writing a piece on that now and will add and reference it shortly. [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 10:23, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I was very confused writing this so please tell me if i'm wrong before I go posting it -   ===David M. Berry===
Berry has a pessimistic view of Lessig's idea that there should be a &quot;free culture&quot;. He feels that it only labels culture as a &quot;resource&quot;(Berry,2006), and it can be easily controlled and owned at the expense of finding the ethical motives behind ownership. Berry argues that the Creative Commons may allow the sharing of culture resources but none of it is &quot;shared in common, nor owned in common, nor accountable to the common itself&quot;(2006). Therefore, it is down to private individuals to pick and choose when to reuse the commons when they so wish. In turn, blockages in creativity become a problem in the cases of lawyers due to the fact that they become mandatory passing points. This means that the &quot;ethical implications&quot; of the sharing of culture is now being restricted by legal barriers.&lt;ref&gt; Berry D. and Moss G.(2006) &quot;The politics of the libre commons.&quot; retrieved 3 April 2014 from http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1403/1321 &lt;/ref&gt; [[User:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|Fraser- Superdry T-shirt]] ([[User talk:Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fraser- Superdry T-shirt|contribs]]) 11:42, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

Laura, in the glossary how did you make the heading bold? I was gonna add in creative commons … &quot;Creative Commons&quot; - A none profit organisation with the purpose of enlarging the range of creative ideas available for others to have the ability to share and to expand upon in a legal manner.

Just highlight what you want to be in bold and press the wee B at the top of the text box. That's a good definition too! [[User:LittleLauraBeaton|LittleLauraBeaton]] ([[User talk:LittleLauraBeaton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleLauraBeaton|contribs]]) 15:31, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

::''Related Introductory Trainz articles:'' [[Trainz/file formats]], [[Trainz/containers|containers]], [[Trainz/Kinds|kinds]], and {{TR|Index of Tags &amp; Containers}}

'''Tags''' are Trainz term for simple {{Wp|data structure|data pairings}} containing one  elemental {{wp|data type|type of data}} paired with a keyword. ''Elemental data types'' or elementary data types in Trainz means text {{wp|string (computing)|strings}}, single value {{wp|boolean}} (0 or 1 only), integer (natural) or decimal (floating point) number types which are assigned legal values compatible with that data type. There are also a couple of work-around hybrid data types, which consolidated multiple string key name codes in the same single (''newer'') tag key name which are now assigned a range of values (referred in this work) to as a string array separated by semicolons. There is a similar array construct for tags latitude, longitude, and elevation value definitions, each containing three comma-separated floating point values. 
 
More complex data groups used in Trainz data definitions are discussed in {{TL|containers|Trainz containers}} and in {{TL|Kinds|Trainz kinds}}, in and of themselves a 'container', but of a more unique type. In one sense, Trainz assets are nothing but a collection of data organized by proper enumerated codes and these containers, including the parent-classed containers known as {{TR|Kinds}} define the interrelationship and configuration of an asset. The container is but one element in an assets self-definition as initialized by the asset creator.

In a very real sense, the KIND data structure (grouping related data of disparate type relevant to the needs of model rendering and run-time simulation) is a first level {{TG|C|container}} in Trainz (albeit with a special name, &quot;KIND&quot;), and will almost always require other container level data groups accompany it in the ini files.

/&gt;Now all container and container-like structures occupy the config.txt file, but the distinction is simply that container defined types usually have scope in several different KIND defined assets, whereas each KIND is unique to that class of asset. KIND Engines and KIND Traincar both have bogeys (wheels on trucks) so both have a bogeys container in their ini file. Tags on the other hand have local scope as a Config.txt tag, or within a container where it's purpose is the same, to define and initialize a particular single data item with a value.

==Enumeration and variable values==
Some values are tightly proscribed by a pre-defined list of allowed values, this is known as '''''an enumerated type'''''. The values in the tag {{TR|tags|category-class}} are tightly controlled, which is to say ''must come from a given list of allowed values'' on which they were enumerated (listed out). They are in-effect, alphanumeric codes which when defined, must be on the list. Other normally seen upper level Config.txt tags {{TR|tags|category-era}} and {{TR|tags|category-region}} are two tag types which ''are both enumerated'' and odd because they are both ''''''string-arrays'''''' which replaces a number of listed individual tags as was the formulation in an older, now obsolescent Trainz release version. 
{{void|1=
==Important Everyday Tags==
The answer is dependent upon what sort of assets you are dealing with at the moment.

A Trainz '''Asset''' is a self-defining collection of mutually supporting more elementary data types that are usually used alone or in some cases, are used as an accessory in conjunction with other Assets to be rendered by the game software into a realistic 3D model of some sort and degree.

When an asset is a sub-component (a wheel type making part of a bogey or truck), it is usually set off inside a {{TR|C|p=container}} which will likely define other information about how the asset is used by the larger asset. Thus assets can greatly differ both in complexity and size, generality and specificity. Consider the many [[Trainz/Steam_locomotive_components|shapes on a steam locomotive]] and each part that moves independent of others. Each group will likely have component assets, and the complicated whole is made up of building blocks small asset by small asset. Each visible surface needs a definition in 3-space of a {{wp|polygon mesh}} and each of these {{TR|K|mesh|p=meshes}} need organized to attach to one another, animation files to generate motion effects, smokes to express the dynamism of the effluents issuing from the Iron Horse, and coloring or textures to hang on the meshes in a wrap if the aspect is viewable from multiple directions, or as a planar placement, if the surface is planar as with a box car exterior, CAB roof{{efn|Even curved roofs in mathematics are planar surfaces describable by a relatively simple vector equation to the mathematically cognizant. That the geometry and trigonometry are 3d-space variants in cylindrical or spherical co-ordinates is a more inclusive discipline than the more familiar 2D toolkit of Euclidian or plane geometry&amp;mdash; which turn out to be a &quot;degenerative case&quot; under the more inclusive rules and analytic methods of the higher form of mathematics.}}

Further, Assets can range from a sound or HTML data file providing background (one as 'realism' or color, the other as a instruction in a game {{TL|Driver}} {{TL|Session}}), a texture used to fill in the surface color and surface effects of a {{wp|polygon mesh}}, the mesh itself, or an aggregate of several or many sub-components, like the obvious kinds of rolling stock. But assets also include buildings, trackside related objects such as signals, relay boxes, {{TG|S|junction switches}} (points) and switch motors or switch levers.

'''Crowdsourcing: the Wiki Way of Working''' explains an approach to organising work that is in some ways the opposite of traditional planning and management. It draws out some lessons from the most visibly successful crowdsourcing projects that support education and research, including Wikipedia. It shows how these community-based projects, despite their unorthodox methods, share educational and scholarly objectives with more traditional institutions and projects. It suggests ways in which those institutions and projects can benefit from working with Wikipedia and the wider Wikimedia community.

It was originally published in February 2014 as [http://www.jiscinfonet.ac.uk/infokits/crowdsourcing an infoKit on the Jisc infoNet site] and is reproduced here under its CC-BY-SA licence. It can be read as a series of self-contained points or case-studies, or as a journey from theory to practice. Development of the infoKit was funded by [http://www.jisc.ac.uk/ Jisc] and [[:wmuk:Main page|Wikimedia UK]].

This is not meant to be a comprehensive manual of crowdsourcing. The topic is also addressed in parts of the Wikibooks ''[[Citizen Science]]'' and ''[[Lentis|Lentis: The Social Interface of Technology]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Imagine you have a big, complicated task which can be broken down into many small steps. We will set in motion a machine – that is, a digital computer – to carry out the task. Here are two possible approaches.

Computer 1 works in sequence through its list of instructions. If it has to add two numbers, it grabs the two numbers from wherever they are stored, puts them through its adding machine, sends the answer to be stored and then clears its workspace to prepare for the next instruction. It only begins a step once the previous one is complete.
[[File:Linear_growth_schematic.PNG|300px|center|Computer 1 over time]]

Computer 2 is completely different. Parts of Computer 2 are constantly breaking off and other things are constantly sticking to it. It thus exists in a state of near-equilibrium with its environment. However, it makes progress because the equilibrium is not exact. When part of its structure corresponds to part of the correct solution to its problem, Computer 2 becomes a little bit more stable. So over time it grows bigger and more complete, even though from minute to minute it is rapidly changing in a way that seems chaotic. Just under half the steps in the development of Computer 2 are reversals of previous steps.
[[File:Organic_growth_over_time.PNG|300px|center|Computer 2 over time]]

Another difference with Computer 2 is that a constant proportion of its steps give incorrect answers. Asked for 1+1 it will most of the time say 2, but every now and again give 3 or 4. This is not as disastrous as it sounds, because the answers are so frequently erased and replaced, and correct answers are more stable and more likely to become part of the long-term structure. Still, there is no guarantee that every instruction is carried out correctly.

Here is another difference: Computer 2 is more energy-efficient by a factor of a hundred or a thousand, according to the physicist Richard Feynman. What’s more, these two machines are things we encounter all the time. Computer 1 is a microprocessor of the type we have in our computers, our phones, our cars, and ever more everyday objects. Computer 2 is DNA.

The long-term sustainability of DNA is not in question. Microprocessors had to be brought into existence and need constant external power because of their relative inefficiency. By contrast, DNA just happened when certain molecules came together. DNA does not need to be plugged into the wall. Given enough time and the opportunity to make lots of mistakes, DNA has made things that seem highly designed for their environment, all without any kind of forward planning.

The DNA approach may be unacceptable when guarantees of reliability and quality are paramount. An astronaut getting ready for launch won’t be happy to be told that 90% of the rocket’s components are definitely working properly. Either everything has been checked and tested, or the rocket is not likely safe. So we would not use the DNA approach in building a rocket. Then again, not every task is like this. The different articles in an encyclopedia do not depend on each other in the same way as the parts of a rocket: mistakes in the art history articles do not ruin the usefulness of the articles about military history. Similarly with creating a multilingual dictionary, a database, or a museum catalogue; partial success gives partial utility, not zero utility.

We could say that the DNA approach works to create things that are organic. In practice, organic means:

* Modular: a failure of a part does not mean a failure of the whole
* Visible in quality: it is possible to evaluate the quality of a part, independently from the whole

Open up an encyclopedia, database or educational materials to the public (the “crowd”) for editing and people may contribute, whether to demonstrate a skill, promote altruistic goals, to educate themselves, or for other reasons. It will also invite vandalism, hoaxes and other misbehaviour.

What makes crowdsourcing worth it is the net change over time. In a truly open system, it is not feasible to prevent vandalism entirely, but it is possible to structure it so that the negative contributions are outweighed by improvements. Achieving this is the challenge of successful crowdsourcing.

== Summing up ==
It is not the best way to do everything, but crowdsourcing offers huge efficiency gains for certain kinds of large, complex tasks. Managing it requires a different way of thinking that accepts unpredictability, imperfection and diminished control. Crowdsourced effort is hard to control, but the absence of central control gives it its efficiency and strength.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Imagine I’ve enlisted three people to write a handbook. Amy has an advantage over the others in finding and summarising research but doesn’t write the most elegant English; Ben is best at sourcing, adapting, and captioning images; and Chris, a grammar pedant, is strongest on copy-editing. A natural way to organise them is to divide them into different roles: Amy the writer and Ben the illustrator will pass drafts on to Chris the copy-editor.

Rather than labelling the workers, an alternative – more in the spirit of the DNA computer – is to label the work. The pages of the draft get tags to suggest &quot;This needs updating&quot;, &quot;This needs illustrating&quot;, &quot;This seems finished: needs review,&quot; and so on. Tagged pages go into a queue, so for example Chris tracks what needs doing by looking at the &quot;in need of a copy-edit&quot; queue. Pages with no tags go into a &quot;This needs a tag&quot; queue. Rather than working after each other in sequence, each person works, when they have time, on the next appropriate item.

Let us also introduce microattribution: each page is labelled with who has worked on it and what they have changed. On paper, this could be done with different coloured pens: in the digital sphere this could be a database of contributions. Not only will it be clear that each finished page was worked on by Amy, Ben, and Chris, but each can demonstrate what they added and none has to worry about others taking credit for their work.

This approach is more responsive than rigorous planning. Chris has a comparative advantage at copy-editing over Ben the illustrator, but Ben is still quite good at it. So if the copy-editing takes longer than expected, the relevant queue becomes backlogged, and the workers notice that Ben can vary his work to reduce that queue. He knows that his work will be credited, not assumed to have all been done by Chris. Sometimes the workers will be in a mood to use their special skills, and at other times they might want to work on something more simple and repetitive: they just have to change the queue they work on.

To extend the metaphor, we could invite strangers into this workplace to see the drafts and their tags, track what they do and add tags if their contributions are problematic. Pedants who cannot stand to see misplaced apostrophes might correct some errors in the drafts, and even if the crowd’s contributions are low-value like this, the job still gets done more quickly. Crowdsourcing does not mean that all the work is done by the &quot;crowd&quot;. Crowdsourcing can include engaging a wider public to collaborate with professionals or to add a particular value to work they are already doing.

This is the way of working enabled by a wiki. While by definition a wiki is a site that can be edited quickly and easily (&quot;wiki&quot; being a Hawaiian word for &quot;quickly&quot;), it is perhaps better seen as a technology for organising work, simplifying what would rapidly get out of hand if done with post-its and coloured pens. Tags, categories, queues, backlogs, and user contribution records all help to break down a high-level task (&quot;create a handbook of publishable quality&quot;) into small steps, to distribute effort across those steps, and to track progress.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wikipedia has become one of the top ten most popular websites on a tiny fraction of the staffing or budget of the others. It has created more than 30 million articles in 13 years, across more than 280 languages, harnessing hundreds of millions of person-hours of work. Clay Shirky estimated in 2010 that around 100 million person hours of volunteer effort had gone into making Wikipedia. Collectively, the Wikimedia sites have around 80,000 active volunteer contributors (defined as those making at least five edits per month) and in 13 years have reached more than two billion edits.

A large proportion of changes made to Wikipedia are reversions of other changes: this is not a failure but a consequence of how easy it is to edit, just as it was integral to the DNA computer that most of its steps are reversals of past steps. A huge number of person-hours have gone into heated-but-pointless discussions, but given how controversy is inevitable in topics like Abortion, 2003 invasion of Iraq, or Capital punishment, contributors’ disagreements have not stopped them creating detailed, extensively referenced articles. Wikipedia has an internal bureaucracy that can be arcane and frustrating for users, but when compared to the scale of bureaucracy required for similarly complex tasks, such as running a university, it could be seen as remarkably un-bureaucratic.

Wikipedia is just the best known of eleven multilingual, freely reusable, volunteer-led projects hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation. These include Wikidata, Wiktionary, and others that will be considered later. &quot;Wikimedia&quot; is the umbrella term encompassing these projects, their communities, national and regional non-profit organisations and related activities such as outreach, research and software development.

The [http://www.jiscinfonet.ac.uk/infokits/change-management/culture/organisational-cultures/ change management infoKit] distinguishes four kinds of organisational culture: Collegiate, Bureaucratic, Innovative, and Enterprise. By being very individualistic, consensual, focused on freedom, driven by local cultures rather than global coordination, and focused on the long term, Wikimedia strongly maps onto the Collegiate culture, which also happens to be the culture of old, research-focused universities.

Wikimedia projects have glaring imbalances and biases in their output, reflecting that:

# The things needed to contribute – including broadband internet, access to sources, IT skills, free time, and confidence – are not evenly distributed through the world’s population. For example the density of articles, mapped geographically, corresponds strongly to the availability of broadband internet.
# Contributors’ effort goes into writing about what they are interested in.

Several projects that are very similar to Wikipedia have nothing like the same success (Mako-Hill, 2012). Citizendium is almost exactly like Wikipedia except that contributors have to be credentialed experts. Google Knol shared some features with Wikipedia but allowed individual authors to take ownership of articles. So to learn from Wikipedia’s success it is essential to look at its distinctive recipe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the ways an encyclopedia is an ideal project for crowdsourcing is that it is strongly modular: it can be broken down into many individual pieces of work which do not depend on each other. It may seem, though, that the whole process depends on detailed planning to create a structure in which crowdsourcing will be successful. In particular, it might seem that the policies and guidelines that define good work have to exist before people start the work.

In fact, Wikipedia did not turn out like this. Policies and guidelines are created by the same process as the articles: public editing and discussion to consensus, often seeded by a very short statement. These policies and standards have evolved with the articles.

In the course of writing the best content, or handling the most contentious disputes, the community has reached consensus on points of style, scope, user conduct and so on. This consensus can then be cited in similar debates or written up as a policy or guideline. Once an article is badged as a “Featured Article”, representing the community’s best work, it can be used as a model for the development of related articles. So the role of good content in shaping policy is as important as policy’s role in shaping content.

Wikimedia has as its vision statement:

{{quote|a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.}}

This statement, which reflects both the long-term focus of the project and the moving target it is aimed at, is known by all active contributors and cited as a guiding principle in on-wiki discussions.

Wikipedia’s role is to be a general-audience encyclopedia in the same sense as Britannica. This goal is literally tangible for those generations who grew up with print encyclopedias. Having an &quot;old-fashioned&quot; goal is a plus: projects with too novel a goal restrict their own growth because not enough people can grasp the goal and decide whether it is being achieved (Mako-Hill, 2012). The Wikimedia and Wikipedia goals are made more concrete for contributors when they hear of people benefiting who were previously information-poor, such as the recipients of the One Laptop Per Child project or the use of Wikipedia by schoolchildren in the townships of South Africa.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Whereas the tagline “the free encyclopedia anyone can edit” suggests anarchy, newcomers can be surprised by how constrained and rule-bound the project is. The tagline is correct, but does not convey the evolutionary process that Wikipedia actually employs, preserving encyclopaedic contributions while resisting promotional, crank, or other undesirable influences.

A lot of the activity on Wikipedia is behind the scenes, not part of the encyclopedia itself. This includes policies, style guidelines, noticeboards, discussion pages about improving individual articles, “wikiprojects” to improve a topic area, and discussions about user behaviour. A lot of this is geared towards assessing articles on a detailed quality scale, including processes of informal and formal review. An article’s quality rating, if it has one, is visible on clicking “Talk” at the top of the page on the desktop version of Wikipedia.

;The Wikipedia quality scale

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Class	!!Criteria
|-
|FA	||The article has attained featured article status. Detailed community review process.
|-
|GA	||The article has attained good article status. Specific review  process.
|-
|B	||The article is mostly complete and without major issues, but requires some further work to reach good article standards.
|-
|C	||The article is substantial, but is still missing important content or contains a lot of irrelevant material. The article should have references to reliable sources, but may still have significant issues or require substantial cleanup.
|-
|Start	||The article has a usable amount of good content but is weak in many areas. Quality of the prose may be distinctly unencyclopedic; but the article should satisfy fundamental content policies such as notability, and provide sources to establish verifiability.
|-
|Stub	||The article is either a very short article or a rough collection of information that will need much work to become a meaningful article. It is usually very short, but if the material is irrelevant or incomprehensible, an article of any length falls into this category.

[[File:Featured_article_star.svg|thumb|right|Featured Article symbol]]
Review of a Wikipedia article is different from peer-review of an original research paper for a journal. Someone who “reviews a paper” is also reviewing the research that it reports. It takes expert knowledge to infer, from the paper, how the research was conducted, whether it used the best available methods, and hence whether the research is reliable and significant.

By contrast, a Wikipedia article is not a proxy for something else. The article itself, and its relation to its sources, are the target of the review. The reviewer does not have to infer things that happened away from Wikipedia. The reliability of the article comes from its citations (which is why Open Access research, verifiable by a wider audience, is of more use in improving Wikipedia than paywalled research). So while it is useful for reviewers to be aware of the relevant literature and able to use relevant research tools, it is not essential that all reviewing is done by experts.

Whereas a poorly-written paper reporting significant research might be accepted by a journal and then copy-edited, the reviews on Wikipedia examine the wording and layout in fine detail. Every sentence and citation can potentially be challenged. On the way to Featured Article status, an article typically goes through three review processes, involving at least eight reviewers. While Peer Review and Good Article involve one reviewer (or more if the review is contentious), the Featured Article review is a community process typically involving five or six reviewers. Another contributor reviews the FA discussion to assess whether it has reached consensus.

Whether it involves formal review or not, a quality scale is important in helping contributors work together, rather than against each other. The scale has to be flexible enough to adapt to different subjects, since a summary of knowledge about a battleship is different from a summary of knowledge about an art form. At the same time, the scale has to be cashed out in enough detail to guide individual decisions about progress. Tangible models (other encyclopedias in the case of Wikipedia) make this easier.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[:wikipedia:Stone soup|a common European folk tale]], a cook is tricked into boiling a &quot;magic&quot; stone in water to make &quot;stone soup&quot;. The taste is unappetising, so the cook adds some potatoes to &quot;bring out&quot; the flavour. Other cooks, still unsatisfied, add different herbs and vegetables in the hope of tasting stone soup at its finest. Eventually they all enjoy a delicious, nutritious soup. The stone was not magic, but it was essential to the successful outcome: it was there to create a soup that people would find inadequate and hence would want to improve.

Good articles on Wikipedia usually come from a similar process. They may have begun as a simple definition such as &quot;Cancer is a disease of unrestricted cell growth&quot;. Some of the readers, finding that inadequate, might supply details about symptoms of cancer. Others will have found it incomplete or inaccurate in other ways, and added text and references about treatments, diagnosis, biology and so on. Thus, over thousands of edits, a short definition evolves into a detailed and comprehensive article.

This process is only possible because of Wikipedia's unconventional publication process:

* It was technically possible for users to edit the live version of the site
* Users needed no permission to edit
* No lawyers or managers had to sign off on changes
* The owners of the site were prepared to bear the risk of articles being inadequate or even unreliable, for a long time
* Each change was recorded, viewable to the public, and reversible. So the merit of each change could be discussed at any point after it was made

This illustrates the centrality of openness (in its various forms) to the success of the Wikimedia sites. In a technical sense, the wiki was built in an open way to enable public contributions. In a legal sense, Wikipedia is an open resource whose users are free to alter it. The process of development is open in that it is public and auditable.

The concept of “ready for publication” does not apply in Wikipedia or the other projects. Just as the cooks started tasting soup when it only included the stone, it is essential that articles and their flaws are on public display so that people can improve them. The distinction between “published article” and “unpublished drafts” is replaced by tags or badges to show that content has problems or alternatively that it has passed a review. This puts some burden on the reader to take notice of tags and be appropriately critical, rather than assuming that something is true because it is published.

      <text xml:space="preserve">By default, full copyright applies to new creative works: there is very little that the end user can do in terms of copying or altering them without permission from the owner. Creative Commons licences give a spectrum of different options in which the copyright owner still legally owns the material, but retains more or fewer rights in it, giving advance permission for copies, remixes and derivative works.

The copyright status of the material sets the balance of power between the hosting organisation and the contributors. Hosting organisations might be tempted to use copyright to keep a high degree of control over their content, if not with full copyright then reserving exclusive rights to commercial exploitation. This might seem a desirable move, but it has further effects.

If someone is asked to work in their spare time for the commercial benefit of an organisation, that is less compelling than working in their spare time for the cause of free global education or the advance of knowledge. As well as being a more noble goal, the latter option gives the contributor an assurance they are going to be able to keep and use what they have worked on.

There is a point in this spectrum of rights which defines what are known as free cultural works: text, media, or other works that anyone can use for any purpose, including adapting for their own use and distributing the adapted versions. This mirrors how the word “free” is used in the free software movement. All the contents of the Wikimedia sites (with small exceptions) are free cultural works by this definition.

If Wikipedia were fully copyrighted, improvement of articles would be impossible. Editing and translation of an article creates derivative works in the terms of copyright law. If that required permission of the previous authors, there would be no quick editing.

[[File:Pedia-still-9.jpg|thumb|right|Printed books created from Wikipedia content]]

If the licence were for noncommercial use only, some intended forms of distribution would not be possible, including distribution on a cost-recovery basis. The Wikimedia Foundation have a relationship with a for-profit print-on-demand publisher, PediaPress, which allows users to compile articles into books and to access these or community-created books digitally or in hard copy. This is already being used in universities to create tailored reference works for courses (Wane, 2012). This would not be a viable tool if PediaPress’s printing and selling of a book awaited permission of the Wikipedia contributors.

The choice faced by Wikipedia is not between more or less control of its content. In practice, the choice has been full control of nothing versus hosting and curation of the largest encyclopedia ever written.

The ShareAlike (SA) clause in the default Wikipedia licence stipulates that any derivative work must be given the same licence as the original. Whereas the attribution clause prevents others from taking your work and presenting it as their own, the SA clause prevents others from taking your work, adapting it, and giving the adapted version a more restrictive licence that restricts commercial exploitation to themselves. This, then, is another way to reassure contributors that they are working for a public commons, not private commercial benefit.

The content, policies, digital media and underlying software of Wikimedia projects are freely and openly available. It is technically possible to take them lock, stock and barrel (without private data like user logins) to another hosting organisation. This possibility gives the hosting organisation an incentive to respect the wishes of contributors, which in turn gives people the confidence to contribute. The same applies to Open Source software projects which build up large communities of contributors. Those contributors know that if they are unhappy with the project’s direction they can take an earlier version of the software and build from that (known as “forking”).

That an entire project can fork is not just a theoretical possibility. The crowdsourced travel guide Wikitravel was hosted by the commercial company Internet Brands, until in 2012 the contributors, complaining of insufficient updates and excessive advertising, forked the site to make WikiVoyage, which is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation. This is a rare event but it illustrates how free cultural works maintain the balance of power between host and contributors. It also illustrates that it is the good will of the community, not rights in the content, that keeps the project viable (Benkler, 2012).

Where social media sites ask for exclusive commercial rights, contributors have to question whether the service they get from the site is unique and valuable enough to justify giving up some of their rights to their own content. In 2012 the photo sharing site Instagram retracted proposed new legal terms after a backlash from users. The new terms would have given the site a permanent exclusive licence to sell or licence users’ photos.

Wikimedia’s status as a charity without commercial influences is one factor in getting contributions from the public, but it is not a necessary factor. There are commercial entities using wikis and Creative Commons-licensed content to crowdsource reference sites, some of which use the free MediaWiki software that underlies Wikimedia. WikiHow develops tutorials, Wikia hosts thousands of how-to sites and fan sites, and Internet Brands’ original hosting of Wikitravel is another example.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[http://xkcd.com/214/ Randall Munroe’s cartoon] illustrates what seems to be a common user experience of Wikipedia: its web-like structure, linking all kinds of subjects, draws casual readers in to learn about things they would not have anticipated.

Less obvious, but essential to note, is that this effect works for creation as well as consumption. Anyone who learns how to edit articles about bridges also learns how to edit articles about US Presidents, Batman, or clothing, because all articles are in one software platform. Similarly, anyone who learns how to edit articles on Wikipedia also learns how to edit travel guides on Wikivoyage, news articles in Wikinews, and so on. The immediacy of wiki editing (just press &quot;Edit&quot;, make a change, then press &quot;Save&quot;) means that once someone has a taste for making changes, they can keep doing it whenever they find something they can improve.

There are processes in Wikipedia that require a previously uninvolved editor to review an article and confirm that it meets certain standards, for example Good Article Review. This is usually done on a pay-it-forward basis: a contributor who wants a review of their own article is usually expected to review someone else's contribution, and so on. Hence someone who is fixated on improving one article will, at some point, have to look at other content and decide what improvements it needs.

Contributors come with different intentions. Some want to improve articles about a topic such as their locality, their hobby or a subject they've studied. Others feel best able to contribute in ways that cut across topics: articles in British English, articles with vector diagrams, or articles with embedded geographical data, for example. These different contributors benefit from different categories and navigational tools. Here, the above-mentioned queues (such as &quot;articles with promotional text&quot;, &quot;articles awaiting Good Article review&quot;, or &quot;articles with broken external links&quot;) are valuable tools for helping people find where they can usefully contribute.

Users looking to improve articles of a particular kind use the same navigational tools as users who have come to find that kind of article. So anything that might be used to help readers with navigation can also be used to encourage contributions. Conversely, anything that segments and separates content will discourage some contributions. Separating the collection of articles by topic would make little difference to the topic-focused contributors but would obstruct, and get much less value from, the other kinds of contributor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If the users of a resource are also expected to be contributors, then whatever makes things easier for the readers will indirectly benefit the resource by making it easier to contribute. For this reason, the hosting organisation needs to attend to the balance of power between it and the contributors. Restricting reuse of the content may well lead to there being no content, just as people are less likely to buy from a shop that has no money-back guarantee. Walls around content may keep some contributors in but they keep a larger number of potential contributors from improving it.

Are you free to park anywhere you like? There is a sense in which nothing prevents you from parking your car anywhere that can be reached from the road. You are not physically prevented from parking on your neighbour’s lawn or across the middle of the high street, but this does not mean you are free to do it. Drivers know they can only park in certain places. Elsewhere, they risk getting fined or towed away. So in a physical sense, you can park on people’s lawns, but in a more important cultural sense that actually shapes people’s behaviour, you can’t.

Wikipedia and similar communities have that same distinction between what is technically possible and what is culturally allowable. Technical possibility is determined by the software, but what is culturally allowable is decided in policy, values and community consensus. There is scope for interpretation and for human judgement in deciding what contributors are free to do, just as there is scope for a court to decide if someone’s actions count as murder.

It is technically possible to delete all the text from Wikipedia’s Featured Article, replace journal citations with tabloid newspapers, or to copy articles from a blatantly promotional site. This doesn’t mean that Wikipedia regards you as free to do these things, in fact they would be disastrous, even just as an experiment. For vandals, there are consequences: the edits can be undone and the accounts warned, blocked or banned.

So creating a community-driven site involves establishing and enforcing cultural norms and procedures. These answer such questions as:

* How does the community resolve disputes?
* What distinguishes constructive from unconstructive contributions?
* How do you distinguish good-faith but unconstructive contributions (which require educating or nudging the contributor) from intentional disruption (which requires minimising the future damage they can do)?
* How are disruptive contributions punished? How are constructive contributions rewarded?
* What changes are new users trusted to make, and how can they earn greater trust, or have trust withdrawn?

The transparency and perceived fairness of the answers to these and other questions will affect people’s experience of the community and their willingness to contribute.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wikipedia’s core principles are summed up in [[:wikipedia:WP:5P|&quot;five pillars&quot;]] which all new users are encouraged to learn. A quick summary is:

* Wikipedia is an encyclopedia
* Wikipedia is neutral
* Wikipedia is free
* Users interact in a civil and respectful manner
* Wikipedia does not work on fixed rules

Which of the pillars is the crucial one for getting people to work together productively, and to discuss each other’s work constructively? The fourth pillar may stand out as the obvious answer because it directly tells users to be civil. However, such rules do not guarantee civil behaviour, or the problems with trolling and abuse in online communities could be solved instantly.

More important is the first pillar, “Wikipedia is an encyclopedia”. This specifies a very constrained kind of literature; an encyclopedia is a summary of already-published knowledge. New users who add personal opinions, personal experience or speculation are told that this is inadmissible irrespective of whether they are right or wrong, because those things are not in scope of an encyclopedia.

If the goal of an article about abortion were to decide “the truth” about abortion, the debate would be unproductive and interminable. In practice, this would not be a shared goal because people would work against each other. Deciding what reputable sources say about abortion, and what opinions are held about abortion by different cultures and groups, is more achievable. There is scope for disagreement, but it is a goal that people with widely different opinions can share.

The drive for quality requires that articles are written in a balanced way, and writing a balanced article usually requires multiple sources and points of view to be represented. This incentivises contributors to write about perspectives that they don’t personally agree with. Paradoxically, the focus on verifiable sources can give the impression that Wikipedia is not interested in or directed towards truth, but this focus actually promotes reliability by directing contributors to reliable sources rather than their subjective responses to the topic.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is another sense in which Wikipedia’s goal of creating a free encyclopedia seems to occupy a “sweet spot”. Explaining this involves looking at two other Wikimedia projects.

[[File:Wikisource-logo-en.png|thumb|right|The Wikisource logo]]
Wikisource is a library of free-content texts, including works of literature, reference works, and historically or politically significant documents. It uses crowdsourced effort to upload scans, correct character-recognition errors and proofread. The end product is electronic text that is faithful to the original text of the document or book, organised in a way that makes it useful and findable. Slowly but steadily it has built up hundreds of thousands of documents, many coming from cultural partners such as the British Library or the US National Archives.

Where Wikipedia has to be an original literary work, Wikisource is about replicating texts that already exist. This means that there is a clear measure of progress and fewer possibilities for disagreement. The downside is that there is less scope for creative expression. Contributors do not have the same opportunity to make a personal mark as Wikipedians do when they decide the phrasing or structure for an article.

[[File:Wikiversity-logo-en.svg|thumb|124px|right|The Wikiversity logo]]
Wikiversity aims to be a space where people can “mutually cooperate in an active effort to learn”. This includes creating open educational resources, carrying out educational activities (for any educational context or level) and carrying out original research projects. Its tens of thousands of resources cover the whole spectrum of quality. A group of economists at the University of Exeter have shared [[wikiversity:Economic Classroom Experiments|a handbook of classroom economic experiments]] through the site, benefiting from textual improvements by the community. This is an example of the site’s very best content: there is a lot more of dubious utility, including fringe points of view.

Wikiversity’s scope is very much less constrained than Wikipedia’s; it accepts a lot of material that would be deleted outright from Wikipedia. It is harder to argue that anything should be deleted, since almost any online materials could have some use in education or research. A project similar to Wikipedia but less constrained might sound like it would attract many more contributions and become a greater success. This is the reverse of what happened. One possible reason is reputation: people are prouder of getting their material onto a platform that rejects a lot of contributions. Another is that there may simply be more demand for didactic encyclopedic text than for other types of educational resource. Another is that contributors need the confidence that their actions will improve the site, and that this requires a tightly-defined scope.

Wikipedia, Wikiversity, and Wikisource’s goals are all laudable, and the differences in their success are due to multiple factors that are technical, historical and social. However, the community’s goal plays a part, and Wikipedia’s much greater contributor base and audience result at least partly from the mix of creativity and constraint.

      <text xml:space="preserve">While there are some &quot;do’s&quot; and &quot;don’ts&quot;, the success of Wikipedia is not an easily replicable model, and may even be unique. So in most cases it makes sense not to beat them but to join them. Creating a new volunteer community is hard, but moving digital content into a space where an existing community can work on it is easier (Masum et al, 2013).

Wiki software is used by many different sites for different purposes, not all of which become successful crowdsourcing projects. The site has to function as a community that makes positive contributors feel welcome and destructive contributors unwelcome. It has to encourage people with different interests and opinions to build on each other’s work. The direction taken with this design can make or break the success of the project.

For the crowd to improve content, it needs to be technically and legally possible for them to make changes. So crowdsourcing is impossible without at least some commitment to openness and to the rights of the end user. This section explores some factors that have made Wikimedia successful at attracting a large number of contributions, and some ways in which crowdsourcing can be ruined by too much control.

Wikipedia and its sister projects differ from a conventionally-managed project in the same way the previous section’s DNA computer differs from a microprocessor. This section introduces some of those differences.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wikipedia and its sister sites have not come about by planning the expenditure of effort, but by describing in detail the work to be done, labelling it and giving people a variety of ways to contribute, depending on their knowledge, time, skills and confidence. A crucial part of this success comes from a goal which is appealing, attainable in steps, flexible and tangible enough to be understood by, and inspire, a wide audience. If people are to work for free, they need confidence that their work advances a goal that they admire, and that their involvement will have some visible effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FUN-top|xrefs2=both}}
The '''config.txt''' file is the central descriptor for a Trainz content item. Every content item has a single {{wp|INI file|configuration INI file}} and in Trainz its always named config.txt and will appear in the {{TA|Trainz assets}} folder when the asset is {{TG|O|open for edit}}. The configuration data will determines the name, {{TR|K|=kind}} and {{TG|K|unique ID}} (KUID) of the item, as well as various kind-specific details. All other files used by the asset build of the content item are located ''via references in the config.txt file''. Assets which are used as components but configured to be standalone, will reference by a KUID, 

The config.txt file is stored in the {{TR|formats|ACS Text Format}}. When hand-editing the file, care must be taken to use correct syntax or the meaning of parts or the entirety of the file may become permanently lost. When content is installed into Trainz, or when it is archived (in {{TR|formats|CDP Format}} or similar) the config.txt file is stored in a machine-optimised binary format. If the content is later extracted using {{TL|Content Manager}}, the config.txt file is converted back to text format, however any custom formatting or erroneous syntax is already lost and cannot be restored.


==Standard Tags==
A variety of tags are available to all Trainz content items, regardless of the specific asset type. These tags are inherited from the {{TL|KIND TrainzBaseSpec}} base asset type, and are described there.


==Localisation==
As the {{TR|formats|ACS Text Format}} uses UTF-8 encoding, non-english text entries may occur within any string field in the config.txt file. To allow for multiple locale support and to avoid confusion, the standard string tags which require localisation allow multiple entries and use the following conventon:

* ''username'' - The content's human-readable name, in American English. The English name for the asset must be present.
* ''username-de'' - The content's human-readable name, in German.
* ''username-cz'' - The content's human-readable name, in Czech.
* etc.

The following standard tags support this form of localization:

* {{TR|tags|Username tag}}
* {{TR|tags|Description tag}}
* {{TR|containers|String-table container}}

==Common Containers==
* {{TR|containers|attached-track container}}
* {{TR|containers|extensions container}}
* {{TR|containers|kuid-table container}}
* {{TR|containers|mesh-table container|p=Mesh-table container}}
* {{TR|containers|obsolete-table container}}
* {{TR|containers|string-table container}}
* {{TR|containers|textures container}}
* {{TR|containers|thumbnails container}}
* ...

==Related Links==

&lt;big&gt;

Whether you're a participant who has already done the early labs dozens of times or an instructor who's teaching a session that focuses on a later lab, it is often useful to skip earlier labs and focus on later labs in the RAC Attack curriculum.  Code to automate the RAC Attack labs is currently being developed and tested.


This page will contain instructions for automatically building a standard RAC Attack environment.

{{Info|These steps are being tested on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX}}

== Quick Start ==

{{Warning|you need a lot of memory and free disk space for this. See {{RA/A|RAC_Attack_12c/Hardware_Requirements}}. For these automation labs, 8GB memory can be a stretch if you have other programs running and 40GB disk might be pushing it too. This is still under development!}}

At this point in time, we're working to automate the third and fourth labs - [[../RAC Attack 12c/Create VirtualBox VM|Install Linux]] and [[../RAC_Attack_12c/Create_Virtualbox_Shared_Storage|Create Cluster]].

# Complete the first three labs: [[../RAC_Attack_12c/Hardware_Requirements|Hardware Requirements]], [[../RAC Attack 12c/Software Components|Software Components]] and [[../RAC Attack 12c/VirtualBox Setup|Prepare Host]].  Don't download Oracle Linux; just the database and cluster software.
# Download and install Vagrant 1.5.1
# Download and unzip http://racattack.org/vagrantfile.zip (note that this file changes frequently as we work on it)
# Open a command prompt and change into the directory where you unzipped vagrantfile.zip
# &lt;code&gt;cd vagrantfile-master\OracleLinux\racattack12cR1&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;vagrant ssh collabn1&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;sudo su - oracle -c vncserver&lt;/code&gt;
# Run the vnc client of your choice and connect to vnc://192.168.78.51:1
# discuss issues at http://racattack.org/list or https://github.com/racattack/vagrantfile/issues

{{Info|typing &lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt; for the first time on your laptop will trigger an 808MB download.  to just download the file without provisioning your VM (e.g. while you sleep) you can type &lt;code&gt;vagrant box add racattack/oracle65&lt;/code&gt;.}}

{{Info|even without the download, running &lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt; will take a long time - especially creating 20GB of &quot;shared disk&quot; before starting the first VM.}}

You can now skip to [[RAC_Attack_-_Oracle_Cluster_Database_at_Home/RAC_Attack_Automation#Connecting_to_the_virtual_machine|Connectting to the virtual machine]]

== Credits ==

This project came to you by [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=RAC_Attack_-_Oracle_Cluster_Database_at_Home/Team the RAC Attack Team]


Initial version: [mailto:alvaro@kikitux.net Alvaro Miranda] 14/04


== Getting started ==


For this implementation, we will be using Vagrant, to manage VirtualBox and automate the deployment.

=== Software used in this implementation ===

Besides the software listed in {{RA/A|RAC_Attack_12c/Software_Components}} for SSH, VNC and Grid and Database component, the following software have been used and tested in this implementation.

* [http://vagrantup.com vagrant] 1.5.1
* [http://packer.io packer] 0.5.2

=== OS that are know to work ===

This implementation have been tested in the following operating system:

* Windows 7 Professional 64 bit
* OracleLinux 6.5 64 bit
* Apple OSX OS X 10.9.2

=== OS used in the guest machine ===

The OS used in the guest machine is Oracle Linux 6.5 + updates.

The version of the box used reflect the day when the box was created and updated:

&lt;code&gt;
alvaros-mini:oracle65 alvarom$ vagrant box outdated --global

* 'racattack/oracle65' (v14.03.29) is up to date

alvaros-mini:oracle65 alvarom$ 
&lt;/code&gt;

This version of &lt;code&gt;racattack/oracle65&lt;code&gt; was created and updated to 14.03.29

{{Info|In the future, if new boxes are released, the version will match the day when the box was created}}


===  Hardware requirement ===


# Please review {{RA/A|RAC_Attack_12c/Hardware_Requirements}} and check you met the minimum hardware requirement.


=== Software Components ===


# Go to {{RA/A|RAC_Attack_12c/Software_Components}} and ensure you have all the Software Components listed there.


{{Info| We will use a Vagrant Box that have the OS and all the RPM requirement installed. Oracle Linux ISO are not required for this task}}


=== Vagrant ===

For this lab, you need vagrant, go to [http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html] , download and install vagrant software.

{{Info|This has been tested with Vagrant 1.5.1}}

== Introduction to Vagrant - Vagrant 101 ==


On this lab, we will use vagrant, however is left to the reader visit the [http://docs.vagrantup.com/ Vagrant documentation] in order to learn what other features can be useful outside this lab.


From [http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/why-vagrant/index.html why-vagrant] page:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Vagrant provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments built on top of industry-standard technology and controlled by a single consistent workflow to help maximize the productivity and flexibility of you and your team.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Once the software is installed, a normal deployment goes like this:


# Download a [http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes.html vagrant box]
# Create a [http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/vagrantfile/index.html Vagrantfile]


{{Info|Vagrant is a command line tool, if you are on Windows, open a command line window }}


Let's execute some commands with vagrant:


 &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;alvaros-mini:~ alvarom$ vagrant --help
 Usage: vagrant [options] &lt;command&gt; [&lt;args&gt;]
 -v, --version Print the version and exit.
 -h, --help Print this help.

alvaros-mini:~ alvarom$ vagrant --version
Vagrant 1.5.1

alvaros-mini:~ alvarom$ vagrant box list

alvaros-mini:~ alvarom$ 

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


=== vagrant box ===


A vagrant box is a virtual machine template, with configurations made specifically for vagrant. In order to create box, you need to follow the steps listed at [http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes/base.html base box documentation]

The box used in the lab, have been created using [http://packer.io packer] version 0.5.2

Since vagrant 1.5.x you can download boxes from internet with a simple command:


 &lt;code&gt;vagrant box add racattack/oracle65&lt;/code&gt;


This will download the base box used for this lab.


At this point, the box racattack/oracle65 is in your system, and you can use it.


=== Vagrantfile ===


Vagrant file is where the automation starts, it will include information about what box to use, from where get it, and will execute the customization listed in the Vagrantfile

According to [http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/vagrantfile/index.html vagrantfile documentation], Vagrantfile is:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;The primary function of the Vagrantfile is to describe the type of machine required for a project, and how to configure and provision these machines. Vagrantfiles are called Vagrantfiles because the actual literal filename for the file is Vagrantfile (casing doesn't matter).

Vagrant is meant to run with one Vagrantfile per project, and the Vagrantfile is supposed to be committed to version control. This allows other developers involved in the project to check out the code, run vagrant up, and be on their way. Vagrantfiles are portable across every platform Vagrant supports.

The syntax of Vagrantfiles is Ruby, but knowledge of the Ruby programming language is not necessary to make modifications to the Vagrantfile, since it is mostly simple variable assignment. In fact, Ruby isn't even the most popular community Vagrant is used within, which should help show you that despite not having Ruby knowledge, people are very successful with Vagrant.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To create a new Vagrantfile, you can :


 &lt;code&gt;vagrant init racattack/oracle65&lt;/code&gt;


This will create a simple Vagrantfile on the directory where we are executing this command.


Let's enumerate what we have learn so far:


To download a vagrant box
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant box add racattack/oracle65&lt;/code&gt;


To list the boxes in our system
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant box list&lt;/code&gt;


To create an initial Vagrantfile
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant init racattack/oracle65&lt;/code&gt;


Other commands that we will be using are:


To start/create a new vm
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt;

To connect to a vm
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant ssh&lt;/code&gt;

To reboot a vm
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant reload&lt;/code&gt;


To stop a vm
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant halt&lt;/code&gt;

To check status of a vm
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant status&lt;/code&gt;


{{Info|This command will ask for confirmation}}


To delete a vm
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant destroy&lt;/code&gt;


== lab: create test1 vm ==


In this lab, we will create a simple test1 vm.


*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant box add racattack/oracle65&lt;/code&gt;
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant box list&lt;/code&gt;
*  &lt;code&gt;mkdir test1&lt;/code&gt;
*  &lt;code&gt;cd test1&lt;/code&gt;
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant init racattack/oracle65&lt;/code&gt;
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt;
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant reload&lt;/code&gt;
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant halt&lt;/code&gt;
*  &lt;code&gt;vagrant destroy&lt;/code&gt;

Below the output on my test machine:

 &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;

Congratulations, you created and detroy your first virtual machine with Vagrant.

== RAC Attack Automation ==

=== Architecture ===

At this point, in the [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RA_Architecture_12c.png RAC Attack Architecture] we are in the first step.

[[File:RA Architecture 12c.png|800px|RAC Attack 12c architecture]]

Our Architecture Diagram looks like this:



=== Code ===

The code for this automation implementation can be found at [[http://racattack.org/code racattack.org/code]]

From the code, we are interested in [https://github.com/racattack/vagrantfile racattack/vagrantfile] repo

To download the code are 2 ways:

# Download the zip file
# Using git

{{Info|Please bear in mind that the links can change in the future, so bookmark this webpage and visit [http://racattack.org racattack.org] for latest updates.}}

==== Download the zip file ====


A zip file with all the files required for this project can be downloaded as: https://github.com/racattack/vagrantfile/archive/master.zip

Download,
Unzip
{{Info|Unzip the files in a directory with enough space to hold the virtual disks used when creating the virtual machines.}}
You are done.

==== Using git ====

If you are familiar with git, you can download a copy of this repo as:

&lt;code&gt; git clone https://github.com/racattack/vagrantfile&lt;/code&gt;

If you have github software installed, then you can [[github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/racattack/vagrantfile|click on this link]]

=== reviewing racattack/vagrantfile ===

After downloading the repo locally to your computer, you will end with a structure similar to this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
.
|-- OracleLinux
| |-- README.md
| `-- racattack12cR1


&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

go to the OracleLinux/racattack12cR1 directory

&lt;code&gt;cd OracleLinux/racattack12cR1 &lt;/code&gt;

And the structure will be something like this:

 &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
.
|-- 12cR1
| |-- &lt;scripts&gt;
| `-- readme.txt
|-- Vagrantfile
`-- stagefiles
| |-- &lt;scripts&gt;
` `-- readme.txt
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Before we create our first cluster  ==

Now everything is in place, we can check the status of our cluster:


&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;




alvaros-mini:racattack12cR1 alvarom$ vagrant status

collabn2 eth1 lanip :192.168.78.52
collabn2 eth2 privip :172.16.100.52
collabn2 dns server role is slave
on first boot shared disks will be created, this will take some time

collabn1 eth1 lanip :192.168.78.51
collabn1 eth2 privip :172.16.100.51
collabn1 dns server role is master
Current machine states:
collabn2 not created (virtualbox)
collabn1 not created (virtualbox)
This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
above with their current state. For more information about a specific
VM, run `vagrant status NAME`.
alvaros-mini:racattack12cR1 alvarom$ 

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

What this out put tell us?

It show are 2 nodes:

 collabn2 not created (virtualbox)
 collabn1 not created (virtualbox)

It show we will be able to access them over the following network detail:

 collabn2 eth1 lanip :192.168.78.52
 collabn2 eth2 privip :172.16.100.52
 collabn1 eth1 lanip :192.168.78.51
 collabn1 eth2 privip :172.16.100.51

This mean, we will move from single node, to 2 node.

This also mean, we are one step closer in the RAC Attack Architecture.

[[File:RA Arquitecture step2.png|800x|RAC attack architecture step2]]

The scripts provided in &lt;code&gt;stagefiles/*.sh&lt;/code&gt; will do all the configuration required for a Oracle RAC Cluster.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;

racattack12cR1
`-- stagefiles
| `-- &lt;scripts&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

If we review the output of &lt;code&gt;vagrant status&lt;/code&gt;, we also have:

 collabn2 dns server role is slave
 collabn1 dns server role is master

This mean, when we provision our lab, &lt;code&gt;collabn1&lt;/code&gt; will be a dns server master and &lt;code&gt;collabn2&lt;/code&gt; will be a dns server slave.

Other piece of information is:
 on first boot shared disks will be created, this will take some time

This is, on the first execution of &lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt; Vagrant, using our Vagrantfile will setup everything we need to have for a correct installation of an Oracle RAC 12cR1.

At this point you can do &lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt; to create your very first 2 node rac cluster using this project.

== vagrant up  ==

&lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt; command, will read Vagrantfile and will create what is in this file.

This project Vagrantfile have been tested, and improved, and does all the OS requirement to have an Oracle RAC 12cR1 installation, free of issues.

=== Order matters ===
Vagrant execute the scripts and create the machines top to bottom, so for advances uses, we may end installing software, or doing some tasks after the provisioning, so for that, we need all the nodes up and running, so we will be doing  collabn2 first, then collabn1. In this way, once collabn1 is up and running, we can be sure all is up and ready.

=== Review of vagrant up output ===

Let's review the output.

A [https://github.com/racattack/vagrantfile/blob/master/OracleLinux/vagrant-up.log sample vagrant up log] can be found on the project page at https://github.com/racattack/vagrantfile/blob/master/OracleLinux/vagrant-up.log in case you want to review, before executing your own run.

{{Info|Not all the output will be reviewed. We will highlight the important bits}}

At this stage, the base box is imported.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
==&gt; collabn2: Importing base box 'kikitux/oracle65-racattack'...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


At this stage, the box is being renamed from the template, into a name suitable for us.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
==&gt; collabn2: Setting the name of the VM: collabn2.1404011431
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Vagrant magic:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
==&gt; collabn2: Clearing any previously set network interfaces...
==&gt; collabn2: Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Here, in the &lt;code&gt;pre-boot&lt;/code&gt; section, is where the shared disk are created. We will review this later.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
==&gt; collabn2: Running 'pre-boot' VM customizations...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Booting the virtual machine, and setting hostname
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
==&gt; collabn2: Booting VM...
==&gt; collabn2: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...
==&gt; collabn2: Setting hostname...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt; 

Mounting shared folder
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
==&gt; collabn2: Mounting shared folders...
collabn2: /vagrant =&gt; /Users/alvarom/racattack12cR1
collabn2: /media/sf_12cR1 =&gt; /Users/alvarom/racattack12cR1/12cR1
collabn2: /media/stagefiles =&gt; /Users/alvarom/racattack12cR1/stagefiles
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Executing scripts
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
==&gt; collabn2: Running provisioner: shell...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt; 

=== Shared disk ===
In order to be closer to the RAC Attack 12cR1 Architecture, we need to have shared disks.


This implementation, performs automatically on the first boot the [[RAC_Attack_-_Oracle_Cluster_Database_at_Home/RAC_Attack_12c/Create_Virtualbox_Shared_Storage|RacAttack Create_Virtualbox_Shared_Storage steps]]

Let's check collabn1

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
alvaros-mini:racattack12cR1 alvarom$ vagrant status
collabn2 running (virtualbox)
collabn1 running (virtualbox)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt; 

Let's connect to &lt;code&gt;collabn1&lt;/code&gt; and become root

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
alvaros-mini:racattack12cR1 alvarom$ vagrant ssh collabn1 
[vagrant@collabn1 ~]$ sudo su -  
[root@collabn1 ~]#
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Let's check the disks.

* udev disk

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
[root@collabn1 ~]# ls -al /dev/asm* /dev/sd*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Apr 1 01:35 /dev/asmdisk1 -&gt; sdc1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Apr 1 01:35 /dev/asmdisk2 -&gt; sdd1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Apr 1 01:35 /dev/asmdisk3 -&gt; sde1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Apr 1 01:35 /dev/asmdisk4 -&gt; sdf1
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 0 Apr 1 01:35 /dev/sda

brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 64 Apr 1 01:35 /dev/sde
brw-rw---- 1 grid asmadmin 8, 65 Apr 1 01:35 /dev/sde1
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 80 Apr 1 01:35 /dev/sdf
brw-rw---- 1 grid asmadmin 8, 81 Apr 1 01:35 /dev/sdf1
[root@collabn1 ~]#
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt; 

We have 4 shared disks, sdc,sdd,sde,sdf
We have persistent aliases


* OracleASM disks

{{Info|oracleasm-tools have been used to setup the /dev/oracleasm/disks alias device}}

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=bash&gt;
[root@collabn1 ~]# ls -al /dev/oracleasm/disks/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 Apr 1 01:35 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 0 Apr 1 01:35 ..
brw-rw---- 1 grid asmadmin 8, 33 Apr 1 01:35 ASMDISK1
brw-rw---- 1 grid asmadmin 8, 49 Apr 1 01:35 ASMDISK2
brw-rw---- 1 grid asmadmin 8, 65 Apr 1 01:35 ASMDISK3
brw-rw---- 1 grid asmadmin 8, 81 Apr 1 01:35 ASMDISK4
[root@collabn1 ~]#
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

{{Info|[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/linux/asmlib/ol6-1709075.html oracleasmlib is included in the Oracle UEK Kernel]. This machines use UEKR3}}

Shared disk created, permission set. Ready to use.

Once again, this mean we are one step closer to the RAC Attack 12cR1 Architecture:

[[File:RA Arquitecture step3.png|800x|RAC_ATTACK Architecture step3]]

=== What came included by default ===

On top the detailed description already provided, this Automation script does:

* Create the required groups, for role separation per Oracle RAC Manual
* Create user grid
* Update groups of user oracle
* Initialize sdb disk for oracle binaries, mount it as /u01
* Setup DNS Settings for Master node (collabn1) slave (collabn2)
* Setup ulimit for grid user, for role separation

=== Default users and password ===

* User   root, password   root
* User   grid, password   grid
* User oracle, password oracle

== Connecting to the virtual machine ==

At this moment, you have 2 ways how to connect to the virtual machines

* &lt;code&gt;vagrant ssh collabn1&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;sudo su -&lt;/code&gt; to become root.

 You can became grid   user as  &lt;code&gt;sudo su - grid&lt;/code&gt; from vagrant
 You can became oracle user as  &lt;code&gt;sudo su - oracle&lt;/code&gt; from vagrant

* ssh/putty to the ip

You laptop computer is connected to both networks, lan 192.168.78 and priv 172.16.100.51.

So you can ssh directly to the machines.

&lt;code&gt;
collabn2 eth1 lanip :192.168.78.52
collabn2 eth2 privip :172.16.100.52

collabn1 eth1 lanip :192.168.78.51
collabn1 eth2 privip :172.16.100.51
&lt;/code&gt;

== Congratulations ==

At this point, you have a 2 node cluster, all ready to work.

This mean, we are 100% with the RAC Attack 12cR1 Architecture, congratulations.

[[File:RA Architecture 12c.png|800px|RAC Attack 12c architecture]]

== What's next ==

Place your downloaded zip oracle binaries in racattack12cR1/12cR1:

 &lt;code&gt;
 12cR1/linuxamd64_12c_grid_1of2.zip
 12cR1/linuxamd64_12c_grid_2of2.zip 
 12cR1/linuxamd64_12c_database_1of2.zip
 12cR1/linuxamd64_12c_database_2of2.zip
 &lt;/code&gt;

Configure VNC session, or use X11, from: [[RAC_Attack_-_Oracle_Cluster_Database_at_Home/RAC_Attack_12c/VNC_Server_Setup|RAC_Attack_12c/VNC_Server_Setup]]

Configure VNC Server with the oracle account (passwords won't be displayed):

 [root@collabn1 ~]# '''su - oracle'''
 [oracle@collabn1 ~]$ '''vncserver :1'''
 
 You will require a password to access your desktops.
 
 Password: '''racattack'''
 Verify: '''racattack'''
 xauth:  creating new authority file /home/oracle/.Xauthority
 
 New 'collabn1.racattack:1 (oracle)' desktop is collabn1.racattack:1
 
 Creating default startup script /home/oracle/.vnc/xstartup
 Starting applications specified in /home/oracle/.vnc/xstartup
 Log file is /home/oracle/.vnc/collabn1.racattack:1.log

Open a vncviewer on your laptop and fill the ip address of '''collabn1''' followed by :'''1'''.

{{Info|On OS X and Linux you can use X11 forwarding instead of VNC. To do that, use the -X flag with your ssh command as in '''ssh -X -l oracle 192.168.78.51'''. If you are using Mountain Lion or later, you may have to install XQuartz first as described at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5293}}


[[File:RA-VNCViewer-Connect form.PNG|RA-VNCViewer-Connect form]]

Enter the password '''racattack''' when prompted:

[[File:RA-VNCViewer-Password form.PNG|RA-VNCViewer-Password form]]

The graphical interface is ready for the Grid Infrastructure Installation.

[[File:RA-VNCViewer-Connected.PNG|800px|RA-VNCViewer-Connected]]


{{Info| Due the nature of Vagrant, the interfaces are eth1: LAN eth2: Interconnect }}

When you get to the interface setup of Grid Infrastructure, please have in mind that the interfaces, due Vagrant requirement are different than the 12cR1 book:

When ready to configure the networks, you need to:

Click on '''Identify Network Interfaces...'''&lt;/li&gt;

Check that the correct addresses are set:

* &lt;big&gt;'''eth0''' is marked as '''Do Not Use'''

* &lt;big&gt;'''eth1''' is marked as '''Public'''

* &lt;big&gt;'''eth2''' is marked as '''Private'''

Click '''OK''' to close the '''Identify Network Interfaces''' window.

Finally, click '''Next'''

Now you can go to the RAC Attack 12cR1 book, and start from [[RAC_Attack_-_Oracle_Cluster_Database_at_Home/RAC_Attack_12c/Prepare_for_GI_install|RAC_Attack_12c/Prepare_for_GI_install]]

== Update base box ==

As today, the version of &lt;code&gt;racattack/oracle65&lt;/code&gt; is 14.03.29

This is the base box, the box used to create new guest machines.

When a new guest machine is created, that is on the first time you run &lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt;, or when you want to recreate your system after running &lt;code&gt;vagrant detroy &lt;/code&gt;

{{Info|In the future, if new boxes are released, the version will match the day when the box was created}}

In order to validate if you are in the latest version available, use command &lt;code&gt;vagrant box outdated --global&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;
alvaros-mini:racattack12cR1 alvarom$ vagrant box outdated --global
* 'racattack/oracle65' (v14.03.29) is up to date
alvaros-mini:racattack12cR1 alvarom$ 
&lt;code&gt;

This will check the version of the base box installed.


When a new version came out, the command to update the base box is &lt;code&gt;vagrant box update&lt;/code&gt;

Example output:

&lt;code&gt;
alvaros-mini:racattack12cR1 alvarom$ vagrant box update
==&gt; default: Checking for updates to 'racattack/oracle65'
default: Version constraints: &gt;= 0
default: Provider: virtualbox
==&gt; default: Box 'racattack/oracle65' (v14.03.29) is running the latest version.
&lt;/code&gt;

== Update OS  ==

If you require to update the OS of the guest machines, the machines are configured to use [http://public-yum.oracle.com public-yum] from oracle.

This mean you can update executing &lt;code&gt;yum update&lt;/code&gt;

For more information [http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E37355/html/ol_about_yum.html about yum] please visit http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E37355/html/ol_about_yum.html

{{Documentation subpage}}
&lt;!-- Please add categories to the bottom of this page, and add interwikis to Wikidata. --&gt;
{{ORP-top}} &lt;/div&gt;
;The above is the top of page corresponding template with default output shown.
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;!-- 
{{Lorem}}

{{Lorem}} 
---&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/div&gt;
;Purpose
:: 1) This template is used with {{Tl|ORP-top}} to set off Wiki reference pages, ''and especially those'' that are based on or adapted from the portions of freeware (Public Domain) assets used as examples or from the N3V TrainzOnline Wiki which need an attribution to the {{plain link|https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/us/|CC-BY-SA 2.0 License}}. Use of this template will assert those message properly on the page bottoms of reference pages.

:: 2) Auto-categorize the page, with consistent easy 'switch' parameters to change modes and mixes of categories, which switching is consistent among the various bottom templates in the divisions of the Wikibook.

=== Usage ===
:* Use after {{tl|ORP-top}} for any page copied or largely derived from the TrainzOnline Wiki you must use {{Tl|ORP-bot}} to do the same auto-category &amp;mdash; and more importantly acknowledge CC-by-SA-2.5 licensing for materials quoting the N3V wiki '''AND''' link the url of the source page using url=FULLPATH captured using {{kp|CTRL|A|CTRL-C}} on your address bar. 
:* Be sure to test any and every off-site url, including Wikipedia links.
;Use on pages that are
# augmented Trainz Online Wiki sourced pages, and for
# general reference pages to be listed in {{TR|p=References TOC}} page.
# This includes ''especially' the'' 'dated' ''pages classed as appendixes by subpages, and things that are not directly parts of Trainz modeling, such as articles on file types (e.g. {{TR|R|texture.txt file}}s).

==Parameters and their effects==
When these parameters are defined, they have the described effect:
&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|1= or |something&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (evaluate as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;) acts as a pipetrick for categories linked in by the template.
# both - adds auto-category 'Trainz references' and 'Trainz reference pages', the one also getting appendix pages.
## both - also adds Hidden auto-category 'Both Trainz fundamentals &amp; refs' '''iff FUN is defined'''.
# cat1, cat2, cat3 - add optional categories, not normally in the auto-categories.
# AM&amp;C - adds auto-category 'Trainz AM&amp;C'
# FUN  - adds auto-category 'Trainz Fundamentals'
# inhibit suppresses the reference auto-categories 
# IT   - adds auto-category 'Introductory Trainz'
# nomsg -  suppresses the auto-footer CC-by-SA message box AND negates any input via  parameter '''|url='''.
# nourl -  suppresses auto-categorization to a trapping list category, listing pages without the link to source parameter '''|url='''.
# refs2- same as both for ONLY this template, it's native function in the other Footer templates (is to express the references categories) which are {{Tl|AM&amp;C-bot}}, {{Tl|TRScc-bot}}, {{Tl|FUN-bot}}, {{Tl|PI-bot}}, {{Tl|IT-bot}}, {{Tl|TUT-bot}}.
# TBKR - adds and identifies pages Fundamenal to all intermediate and basic Trainz Knowledge.
# '''url''' - must be defined for pages sourced in whole or in part from the TrainzOnline wiki. It should also be used for source materials used from Third Party fansites used with permission and adapted to the wiki.

All the footer templates will also always auto-categorize the hidden categories:
#*    All Trainz sub-pages
#*    All Trainz pages

&lt;/tt&gt;
----
;this page auto-includes the below template box message as the page footer.
 
{{TRS-ref-page|nourl=1}}

* it will pass the link parameter URL=weblink or url=weblink to the footer template which then looks like this:
{{TRS-ref-page|URL=http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/Download_Station}}
* The above mode (with url linked to the source page on the TrainzOnline Wiki) '''''must be used''' if the page is adapted from the ''''N3V Wiki'''''.
----
* The parameter AM&amp;C if defined will auto-categorize the page to [[:category:Trainz AM&amp;C]] as well as the default auto-category: [[:category:Trainz reference pages]]

* The parameter IT if defined will auto-categorize the page to [[:category:Introductory Trainz]] as well.

* It will also auto-categorize the page to the [[:category:Trainz references]] a category name shared with the Trainz Wiki (for ease of page portability and consistency).

* It can be given the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; default parameter to alter the sort order of the reference page as listed in that category. (see example below)

==Options==
# Defining &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{nomsg|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Will do no message box footer when it's not needed.
# Defining &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{nourl}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Will suppress the auto-categorization 'trap' listing the page as having no URL.
# Defining &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{noautocat|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Will suppress all auto-categories, including the All pages and All Trainz subpages lists. This is strictly for tags on Category pages
# Defining &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{inhibit|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Will do no [[:category:Trainz reference pages]] and  [[:category:Trainz references]] auto-categories but does list the pages in {{lc|All Trainz pages}} and {{lc|All Trainz sub-pages}}
# define '''&lt;nowiki&gt;'| cat1=', '| cat2=', or '|cat3='&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''some-cat-names''''' to add those categories to the page '''''without either''''' &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;Category:&quot; namespace, nor '[[' or ']]' allowed&lt;/nowiki&gt;. (their provided free of charge along with the default pipe tricking to the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{SUBPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; (See: [[mw:Help:Magic words|Magic word]]).
&lt;hr&gt;
* Lastly, this template closes a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div style=&quot; ...&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; HTML block initiated by {{Tl|ORP-top}}. They should be used together as a pair top and bottom of each page.

# &lt;nowiki&gt; {{ORP-bot|inhibit=1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on {{TR|KD|KIND Engine}} ''will not auto-categorize the page at all'', allowing parameters cat1, cat2, cat3 to override normal categorization.
## &lt;nowiki&gt; {{ORP-bot|Engine}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on {{TR|KD|KIND Steam-engine}} will alphabetize the article under ''''Engine'''', while
## &lt;nowiki&gt; {{ORP-bot|KIND Engine}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on {{TR|KD|KIND Enginesound}} will alphabetize the article under ''''KIND''''&amp;mdash;&lt;code&gt;a form to be &lt;u&gt;avoided&lt;/u&gt; with'' &lt;/u&gt;KINDs pages&lt;/u&gt;'' {{BullR
}}which ought have alphabetization under their 'kind-name' of 'KIND kind-name' {{TN|N|NAMCON}} forms.&lt;!--
--&gt;
## &lt;nowiki&gt; {{ORP-bot|Engine}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on {{TR|KD|KIND Engine}} will alphabetize the article under ''''Engine''''. In the given example, Engine has ''no 'different' effect'', so the same result as case 2.
#  &lt;nowiki&gt; {{ORP-bot|cat1=category-name|Engine}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on [[KIND Engine]] will alphabetize the article under '''Engine''' to the secondary category, just as a normal 2nd &lt;nowiki&gt;[[category:category-name|Engine]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; long form would do, as well as the normal default [[:category:Trainz references]]. ''Inhibit affects only the default if defined,'' so up to three alternative categories (cat1=, cat2= &amp; cat3=) can be specified for odd categorizations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Edwards' Dodo.jpg|thumbnail|right|Edward's Dodo]]
The '''[[w:Dodo|Dodo]]''' (Raphus cucullatus) is a flightless, extinct bird which inhabited the island of [[w:Maritius Island|Maritius]], and island 1,200 miles down the [[w:African subcontinent|African Subcontinent]]. Nothing is much known about this bird since the only things we have left of the Dodo is pictures and fossils of the bird's bones. 
== How was the Dodo found? ==
It is believed, by ''Extinct Birds'', that the Dodo was found by a Dutch Sailor in 1598 in the island of Mauritius. The name, Dodo, means &quot;Ugly, Disgusting Bird&quot;. It was named that because of the appearance. Many believe, however, that the Dodo only habitat was in the island of Mauritius, so Dutch explorers may have been going through the African subcontinent 1,000 miles below.

== How is the Dodo extinct? ==
[[File:Jacht op dodo's door Willem van West-Zanen uit 1602.jpg|thumbnail|right|The process of the killing of Dodos, which led to there extinction]]

[[File:Dodo head and leg.jpg|thumbnail|Dodo head and leg]]
The main reason why the Dodo is extinct is because it was a real target for food. Not only alive were they killed, but some of their eggs were eaten. Usual Dodo eggs were main food for vultures and coyotes. Which led up to the big extinction. It is to be believed that the last dodo was spotted, or seen, in around the 1660s or the early 1670s. There have also been various other animals that are extinct from Maritius
=== What were the main predators? ===
[[File:View of the Mauritius roadstead - engraving.jpg|thumbnail|right]]
The main predators are mankind. Hence the fact that they are extinct, the dodos became extinct because of Dutch sailors hunting them for food, and as mentioned above that the Dodo eggs are usual prey to many birds or other land animals who were on Mauritius, preventing more dodos from hatching. The dodos became prey of which many of the Dutch sailor's animals, such as pigs, monkeys, and rats.

;Summary:
The famous extinct Dodo, which has a pitiful reputation as a stupendously overweight idiot of a bird that couldn't even fly, has DNA related to the [[w:pigeon|Pigeon]]. Which DNA examinations show.
;Quotes
Island taxa such as the dodo and solitaire often represent extreme examples of evolution—and if we want to examine how we, or the life around us, evolved then such animals are very educational, By examining island birds we can investigate how evolution works—because extreme examples are often the best views of how something works --Alan Cooper, a zoologist at the University of Oxford and one of the co-authors of the study.

=== Preserves of Dodos ===
The only thing we have which traces the Dodo's history is pictures of the bird and bones of the bird, which is preserved mostly in museums. More are come to find, but and most will be carefully examined by special scientists.

==Trainz-build tag number==
The '''trainz-build tag''' number indicates the minimum '''{{TR|R|Trainz build versions|p=Trainz Code Version}}''' required to use the asset. Trainz will not attempt to load an asset which has a trainz-build tag that is newer than it's own version number, but unfortunately {{TA|Content Manager}} will continue to report there are updates, even when they are entirely inappropriate. One can also import inappropriate {{TBS|trainz-build}} assets from other versions of Trainz or a library collection (say of fixed assets saved before committing after Faults cleanup&amp;mdash;a 'handy habit' for those of us running more than one Trainz {{TN|install}}), so one need be aware of that.

This tag is also an indication of the age of the asset, and the general technical configuration and standards to which it is built. The values will range up from the oldest {{TL|Trainz 1.3|Trainz 1.0}} release (2001) with three {{wp|service pack|Service Packs}} making the version commonly referred to as Trainz V-1.3, or {{BL|Trainz 1.3}}.  Assets with old Trainz-build numbers are not built to take advantage of new Trainz features that did not exist in the version of Trainz that the asset was built for, and the oldest used approaches which have been entirely abandoned. The trainz-build tag itself was totally unknown until {{TL|Trainz UTC}} and many CC's of that era and for a few years into even the TRS2004 era never assigned a TB code. {{TL|TRS2006}}'s fancy-schmancy {{TL|CMP}} advance didn't even list them in one of it's data columns!  Newer Trainz releases do their best to translate these older technologies into the newer releases standards (data organization and graphical tech) but some small percentage of assets cannot be converted. 
&amp;nbsp;
{{UserTip|The word ''version'' is used in Trainz to refer to three different concepts. There is the '''Trainz Retail Version''', the '''Trainz Version''' and the '''Trainz Build Number'''.
The '''Trainz Retail Version''' is a text string for a product release, such as ''Trainz Simulator 2009''.
The '''Trainz version''' is a numeric code (e.g ''2.4'' or ''3.6'') which is incremented for each major release. This code is updated whenever a significant change to Trainz is made. Most service packs (which introduce significant functionality changes) will have a new ''Trainz Version'', but hotfixes (which do not introduce significant functionality changes) do not see a ''Trainz version'' number change. Different language versions of the same product will also generally share the same ''Trainz Version''.
The '''Trainz Build Number''' is a unique number (e.g. ''44653'' or ''58414'') that identifies an individual Trainz release. All releases (including minor changes and language translations) have a different ''Trainz Build Number''.
The '''Trainz-build''' tag uses the ''Trainz Version'' numeric code.

Other legacy versions of Trainz will also import 'Version unidentified' trainz content.&lt;br&gt; 
 
* '''For the new Trainz users:'''' the moral of this story is to examine trainz-build tags (versions) ASAP after importing new content into CM and provide human intelligence as to whether to delete, keep the asset, or set it aside; seek advice before trying to use, or risk breaking Trainz for while.&lt;br&gt; 
* Some content can be retrograded to work in earlier Trainz releases. More recently published Routes and Sessions cannot. ]]

==Asset compatibility==
It is important for an asset to list the correct Trainz-build in the {{TR|R|config.txt file}}. It specifies the version of Trainz the asset was intended to be used with. An earlier version of Trainz will refuse to load the asset. A later version of Trainz will enable appropriate backwards compatibility workarounds (e.g. using different validation requirements) as required.
&amp;nbsp;

A correctly-constructed asset built for an older version will usually function in a newer version of Trainz. However, while Trainz content validation has improved over time, and newer versions of Trainz detect errors that older versions did not pick up on, many errors are useless make work caused by callous and rapacious programmer and management practices. Often, content may be detected as 'faulty' in a current Trainz version that was missed in the version it was originally created for, but the most frequent issues are missing thumbnail images which have nothing to do with the functionality of the asset, or obsoleted tag names. 

Or that is the official party line per N3V, which ignores the fact there are errors they could just fix in parsing, such as ignoring legacy tag names like {{TBS|type}}, {{TBS|region}}, {{TBS|asset-filename}}, or {{TBS|name-xx}}, etc. and similarly could convert in situ older forms to newer container forms of data, then test for faults. They do neither putting the time cost of their unprofessionalism onto the customers who must one by one correct errors their software should be handling.
&amp;nbsp;

It should be noted that content that is uploaded to the {{TL|Download Station}} is validated for faults by the most recent version of Trainz&amp;mdash;and may be rejected if an more stringent newer fault or error test has been put in place.&lt;ref name=&quot;badpractices&quot;&gt;{{plain link|http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showthread.php?111423-Can-a-new-tag-be-made-for-Trainz&amp;p=1289419#post1289419|Can-a-new-tag-be-made-for-Trainz}}, ZecMurphy, Auran Community Assistant, May 11th, 2014, 09:02 PM &lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|''This depends on the version of Trainz that you are running, and if we've updated the DLS error checking. I can make content that shows no errors in TS2009, but will be rejected from the DLS under the current error checking due to issues that TS2009 could not detect. This is essentially the same here. The DLS error checking is updated regularly, and may be more strict than the error checking in TS12 SP1. OTOH, TS:Mac2 is a newer release and will have most of the updates to the error checking. 

We have stated many, many, many, many, many, times over the last 12 months that the error checking on the DLS is generally ahead of that in Trainz. Hence, if you are given a rejection notice with actual errors in it, you'll need to correct these.''&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;N3V spokesman '''ZecMurphy''' at &lt;nowiki&gt;forums.auran.com/trainz#&lt;/nowiki&gt;post1289419, May 11th, 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;badpractices&quot;/&gt;}} Assets generated under a perfectly valid currently supported version of Trains, using the validation compatibility for the trainz-build specified by the asset, may still be rejected by the Download Station Software.
&amp;nbsp;

If {{TA|Content Creator Plus}} {{TL|CCP}} is used to modify an asset, it will automatically update the trainz-build version in the config.txt file to the current Trainz version it came with. ''This is problematic and contrary to the greatest interests of the most members in the Trainz community, as the lowest trainz-build code is desired from the standpoint of giving the asset the most Trainz users access to the new product (asset). Prior to V3.2, such codes could then be manually back-dated to a lower trainz-build, but the error checking in versions since requires exporting the asset-open-for-edit by copying the folder, reverting it, deleting it, editing the trainz-build code change in the copy, then re-importing it&amp;mdash;a discourteous number of extra steps-in-the-dance for content creators, and yet another friction point with Trainz programmers. If Using CCP to fault fix and update, often this version with the invincibility of naive programmers forcing others to toe their line and if the asset specs have changed significantly, many other changes to the config.txt file will probably be required, as CCP wants to promote the asset to the current Trainz-build version.
{{TrainzTip|If you don't want to spend all of your Trainz time patching assets with the user unfriendly interface of CCP and it's demands on your entries, learn to master manually editing and committing to keep the edits down to only those actually necessary.}}
Assets which are manually edited will need the appropriate version entered. If the line is omitted entirely, the lowest possible version is assumed. This is currently ''Trainz-build 1.3''.{{TRS-check}}
&amp;nbsp;

==Obsolete Versions==
Trainz-build numbers up to and including 2.8 are considered obsolete as of September 2012 and can no longer be uploaded to the {{TL|Download Station}}. See the {{TR|R|Trainz Life-Cycle Policy}} for additional details.

Hey. I agree, I think having subheadings will make the page look more organised and professional. I think that we should start with a detailed description of the actual idea of Always-On Culture and then move on to Turkle and Boyd's ideas, each under their own subheading. What does everyone think? Also, is there something obvious I have missed?

Should we change the main concepts to be more a section for each thinker than each concepts, or just add each of the main thinkers at the end or start of the section ?

Hi guys. I wanted to put in something about the fact that teenagers are more associated with &quot;always-on culture&quot; than any other group of people. Any suggestions of where, under which sub-heading, I should put it? Thanks!

''''reduced context cues'''' why the double bold here and not elsewhere? Try to be consistent with formatting :o) [[User:GregXenon01|GregXenon01]] ([[User talk:GregXenon01|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GregXenon01|contribs]]) 15:07, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Sorry about the double bold on social context cues it was a mistake on my part when making the sub heading and i didn't notice the error till today, however I've fixed it now and will check more carefully next time. As for teenagers being more associated with 'always on culture' you could work it into the idea of being part of a network as they would presumably be the largest part of said network and the implications of that ?

We should be sure to remain consistent with danah boyd's name. Some people are capitalising it when she is known for having it in lower case (even her Wikipedia page has it in lower case). (If anyone is dead against lower case just say here so everyone knows to put it like that). Thanks!

Should we capitalize boyd's name when it is in the beginning of the sentence? --[[User:Kelly.marvel|Kelly.marvel]] ([[User talk:Kelly.marvel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelly.marvel|contribs]]) 17:55, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

Good idea about putting the idea about teenagers being more associated with always on in the networking section. Thanks. I think if her name is lower case even on her Wikipedia page that we should keep it lower case throughout.

I've noticed that there are several different ways that we are saying &quot;Always-On Culture&quot;. Some have upper and lower case, some all upper case, some all lower case and some are in and some are out of quotations. I think they should all be the same, with perhaps the exception of the first time it should be in upper case. Do you think it should have &quot;&quot; quotations or ''? [[User:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|KathrynHairUpAndGlasses]] ([[User talk:KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/KathrynHairUpAndGlasses|contribs]]) 18:33, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

I agree Kathryn that we need to be a bit more consistent in the formatting of the words &quot;Always On Culture&quot;. In the module handbook and all our other course material the topic is refered to as 'Always On' Culture - with the culture aspect being titled as 'Always On' not an entire clause phrase and capitalising the C in 'Culture'. I hope that's helpful, what do others think? [[User:LittleBlondeLottie|LittleBlondeLottie]] ([[User talk:LittleBlondeLottie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/LittleBlondeLottie|contribs]])

I think we should go with what the handbook says. Also, are we putting the references in alphabetical order? Do you think it would look better or do you think they should be in line with where they are in the text? As in, if the reference comes first in the text should it come first in the reference list?

Hey guys, I was wondering for referencing, if we were to use the ref tags or not? https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/RefCodeHandout.pdf [[User:Amandajayner|Amandajayner]] ([[User talk:Amandajayner|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amandajayner|contribs]]) 19:16, 31 March 2014 (UTC)</text>

When I'm not hacking away at this Wikibook, I spend most of my days lazing around playing guitar. I used to sing as well, but it caused many people considerable pain and distress so I've had to stop that.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first comprehensive book to uniquely combine the three fields of systems architecting/engineering, operations/production systems, and multiple criteria decision making/optimization

Systems architecting is the art and science of designing, engineering, and building complex systems—combining art, science, management, and engineering disciplines. Operations and Production Systems with Multiple Objectives covers all classical topics of operations and production systems as well as new topics not seen in any similiar textbooks before: small-scale design of cellular systems, large-scale design of complex systems, clustering, productivity and efficiency measurements, and energy systems.
Filled with completely new perspectives, paradigms, and robust methods of solving classic and modern problems, the book includes numerous examples and sample spreadsheets for solving each problem, a solutions manual, and a book companion site complete with worked examples and supplemental articles.
Operations and Production Systems with Multiple Objectives will teach readers:
# How operations and production systems are designed and planned
# How operations and production systems are engineered and optimized
# How to formulate and solve manufacturing systems problems
# How to model and solve interdisciplinary and systems engineering problems
# How to solve decision problems with multiple and conflicting objectives

Spirituality in India is not just an esoteric philosophy or practice, it has found its place in the most commonplace routines and daily lives of India's people. Looking at how spirituality fits in this context can give us a better perspective of the roots and future of Indian culture. Besides, it also helps us understand the unique nature of spiritual pursuit in India, which is found in various forms: as ascetic practices, the study of scriptures, devotion or bhakti, pilgrimages and temples. This book focuses on indigenously developed spiritual traditions, which include Hinduism and its offshoots, Christianity of the Malabar Coast and Indian branches of the Sufi tradition.

&lt;/source&gt;

== Description ==

&lt;code&gt;MediaWiki::API2&lt;/code&gt; provides a Perl interface to the [[mw:API:Main page|MediaWiki API]].  It’s heavily based on MediaWiki::API by Jools Wills (it’s estimated that around 70% of the code come from there), and the interface is intended to be mostly compatible with it.

There’re, however, a few significant differences between MediaWiki::API2 and MediaWiki::API interfaces:
* MediaWiki::API2 provides a “safe” interface; that is, the class methods generally only return when they succeed; otherwise, an exception (of the &lt;code&gt;[[../MediaWiki::API2::Exception|MediaWiki::API2::Exception]]&lt;/code&gt; class) is raised;
* MediaWiki::API2 supports the MediaWiki API [[mw:API:Query#Continuing queries|“continue”]] facility by the means of an additional &lt;code&gt;query_merge&lt;/code&gt; method;
* several MediaWiki::API methods are not provided by MediaWiki::API2, namely: &lt;code&gt;get_page&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; (convenience); &lt;code&gt;upload&lt;/code&gt; (deprecated); and &lt;code&gt;download&lt;/code&gt;.

== Interface ==
&lt;!-- NB: [[w:Man page]]s are not unknown to have whole paragraphs contained within description lists; as MediaWiki markup does not seem to provide a way to express such a structure, plain HTML is used below instead --&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $mw = MediaWiki::API2-&gt;new (\%options);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create and return a new MediaWiki::API2 object.  The following options are available:&lt;/p&gt;
; &lt;code&gt;api_uri&lt;/code&gt;
: Specifies the [[w:Uniform resource identifier|URI]] of the MediaWiki instance’s [[mw:API:Main page|API]] ''endpoint'' (example: &lt;code&gt;https:{{SERVER}}/w/api.php&lt;/code&gt;.)  ''Note that this option is currently mandatory.''  There is no default.
; &lt;code&gt;api_url&lt;/code&gt;
: This option is an alias for &lt;code&gt;api_uri&lt;/code&gt;, provided for compatibility with [//metacpan.org/pod/MediaWiki::API MediaWiki::API].
; &lt;code&gt;max_lag&lt;/code&gt;
: The query will fail if server reports lag over this number of seconds (an integer.)  This is done by setting the [[mw:API:Mainmodule#Parameters|&lt;code&gt;maxlag&lt;/code&gt;]] parameter in the query.  The default is &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt;, which means that this module will not set the &lt;code&gt;maxlag&lt;/code&gt; parameter by itself.
; &lt;code&gt;max_lag_delay&lt;/code&gt;
: Before retrying the query failed due to the &lt;code&gt;maxlag&lt;/code&gt; condition, the module will wait for this number of seconds.  This number is passed to the &lt;code&gt;sleep&lt;/code&gt; built-in Perl function and should be an integer.  The default is 5.
; &lt;code&gt;max_lag_retries&lt;/code&gt;
: Every time the &lt;code&gt;maxlag&lt;/code&gt; condition is raised, this module will reset the retry counter back to the &lt;code&gt;retries&lt;/code&gt; option’s value.  This option specifies the maximum number of such resets to perform before finally giving up.  The default is 4.
; &lt;code&gt;no_proxy&lt;/code&gt;
: Normally, this module will call the &lt;code&gt;env_proxy&lt;/code&gt; method on the implicitly created [//metacpan.org/pod/LWP::UserAgent LWP::UserAgent] object in order to initialize the proxy settings according to the current environment (see the &lt;code&gt;https_proxy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;http_proxy&lt;/code&gt; environment variables.)  If this option is set to a true value, however, the &lt;code&gt;env_proxy&lt;/code&gt; method will not be called.  The default is false.
; &lt;code&gt;retries&lt;/code&gt;
: If positive, the module will retry the failing query up to this number of times, not counting the first.  It’s an error for this option to be a negative number.  The default is zero.
; &lt;code&gt;retry_delay&lt;/code&gt;
: Before retrying the failed query the module will wait for this number of seconds.  This number is passed to the &lt;code&gt;sleep&lt;/code&gt; built-in Perl function and should be an integer.  The default is zero.
; &lt;code&gt;use_http_get&lt;/code&gt;
: If set to a true value, the module will use the [[w:Hypertext Transfer Protocol#Request methods|&lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; HTTP method]] to perform certain actions (which currently are: &lt;code&gt;query&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;logout&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;purge&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;paraminfo&lt;/code&gt;.)  Otherwise (and for all the other actions) the &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; method will be used.  The default is false.
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $result = $mw-&gt;api (\%query);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $result = $mw-&gt;api (\%query, { });&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perform a query upon the MediaWiki instance associated with the &lt;code&gt;$mw&lt;/code&gt; MediaWiki::API2 object.  See the [[mw:API:Main page|MediaWiki API documentation]].  This is the primary entry point to this module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method currently accepts no options.  To ensure forward compatibility, the second argument should be either an empty hash, or omitted entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $result = $mw-&gt;edit (\%query);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $result = $mw-&gt;edit (\%query, { });&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perform an action upon the MediaWiki instance, acquiring an [[mw:API:Tokens|edit token]] as necessary.  The actions with specific support in the code are &lt;code&gt;edit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;move&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;patrol&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rollback&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;protect&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unblock&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;watch&lt;/code&gt; actions are also expected to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;emailuser&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;upload&lt;/code&gt; “pseudo-actions” are mapped to &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;edit&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.&lt;!-- FIXME: document the details --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method currently accepts no options.  To ensure forward compatibility, the second argument should be either an empty hash, or omitted entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $result = $mw-&gt;login (\%query);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;[[mw:API:Login|Log into]] the MediaWiki instance, acquiring the login token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;%query&lt;/code&gt; hash should contain the user’s name and password under the &lt;code&gt;lgname&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lgpassword&lt;/code&gt; keys, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $result = $mw-&gt;logout ();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;[[mw:API:Logout|Log out]] of the MediaWiki instance, discarding all the stored MediaWiki tokens and [[w:HTTP cookie|HTTP cookies]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $pages_ref = $mw-&gt;query_merge (\%query);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $pages_ref = $mw-&gt;query_merge (\%query, \%pages);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;my $pages_ref = $mw-&gt;query_merge (\%query, \%pages, \%state);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Query the MediaWiki instance and ''merge'' the pages’ metadata returned (within the &lt;code&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt; subsection of the &lt;code&gt;query&lt;/code&gt; section of the query result) into the &lt;code&gt;%pages&lt;/code&gt; hash, if given, or a newly created one.  Return the reference to the hash containing the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pages whose respective entries in the &lt;code&gt;%pages&lt;/code&gt; hash exist but have &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt; as their values will not be updated.  (See also the [[#fits-p|&lt;code&gt;fits-p&lt;/code&gt;]] state entry below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this method both uses the “continue” keys within &lt;code&gt;%query&lt;/code&gt; (if any) ''and updates them'' each time a query finishes successfully.  If such an update is not desired, the caller may pass a reference to a ''copy'' of &lt;code&gt;%query&lt;/code&gt;, e. g., by using the &lt;code&gt;{ %query }&lt;/code&gt; form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;%state&lt;/code&gt; hash may contain entries having the following keys, which, if given (and except for &lt;code&gt;fits-p&lt;/code&gt;), ''will also be updated'' before this method returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code id=&quot;fits-p&quot; &gt;fits-p&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifies a reference to a Perl function to call as soon as new information about a page is obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function will be passed a reference to the hash containing such information.  Should it return a false value, the respective &lt;code&gt;%pages&lt;/code&gt; entry will be set to &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt; and no further metadata will be considered for the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the hash passed to this function may sometimes end up being ''incomplete.''  Hence, this function should only return false when no additional information can change the end result of the tests performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;pages-left&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this number of page entries is updated, no further queries will be considered, irrespective of the &lt;code&gt;queries-left&lt;/code&gt; setting.  The default is &lt;code&gt;undef&lt;/code&gt;, which means that no limit is set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;queries-left&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maximum number of queries to perform, should the result be deemed too large by the server to be returned as a single response.  The default is 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that by updating all of the &lt;code&gt;%query&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%pages&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;%state&lt;/code&gt; hashes passed, this method allows for additional query results to be fetched simply by repeating the calls to this method, passing the same references on each call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

and production systems as well as new topics not seen in any similiar textbooks before: 
small-scale design of cellular systems, large-scale design of complex systems, clustering, 
productivity and efficiency measurements, and energy systems.
Filled with completely new perspectives, paradigms, and robust methods of solving classic 
and modern problems, the book includes numerous examples and sample spreadsheets 
for solving each problem, a solutions manual, and a book companion site complete with 
worked examples and supplemental articles.
Operations and Production Systems with Multiple Objectives will teach readers:
# How operations and production systems are designed and planned 
# How operations and production systems are engineered and optimized 
# How to formulate and solve manufacturing systems problems 
# How to model and solve interdisciplinary and systems engineering problems 
# How to solve decision problems with multiple and conflicting objectives 
This book is ideal for senior undergraduate, MS, and PhD graduate students in all fields of 
engineering, business, and management as well as practitioners and researchers in systems 
engineering, operations, production, and manufacturing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The roots of Indian spirituality and religion stretch back into the stone age. As early as the Paleolithic, we find traces of it in forms that still resonate on the Indian subcontinent today. During the Upper Paleolithic, from 10,000 to 20,000 years before present (BP), there was fire worship and mother goddess worhsip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=World Heritage Monuments and Related Edifices in India |last=Ali |first=Javid |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Algora |location= |isbn=9780875864846 |page=18 |pages= |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=54XBlIF9LFgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;vq=bhimbekta&amp;dq=worship%20india%20stone%20age&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q=mother%20goddess%20worship&amp;f=false |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Baghor, in Madhya Pradesh, the feminine was worship 11,000 years BP using a triangle as a representation. A triangular stone was found incised with triangles, marked in red ochre, at an altar for a goddess. This practice continues even today in villages of the area, where similar stones, smeared in red and incised with triangles are offered to village deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Archaeology and World Religion |last=Insoll |first=Timothy |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location= |isbn=9780203463673 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the rest of India too, the triangular shape is the basis for creating yantras,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.ishafoundation.org/lifestyle/navaratri-2013-flowering-feminine/ |title=Navaratri Celebrations 2013 – Flowering of the Feminine |author= |date=7 October 2013 |work= |publisher=Isha Blog |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are used for the worship of various deities. Archaeologists who excavated the site state that when the area's villagers saw the excavation, they told the archaeologists, “That’s one of our shrines. You must look after it properly.” After the archaeologists left, the villagers began worshipping at the shrine again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Archaeologist at Work in African Prehistory and Early Human Studies: Teamwork and Insight |last=Clark |first=Desmond |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=University of California Press|location= |isbn=|page=248 |pages= |url=http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt3f59n89f;NAAN=13030&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=d0e11490&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e11202&amp;brand=calisphere |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Harappan civilization (also sometimes called the Indus Valley civilization), more defined modes of worship turn up. Worship of the mother goddess is present alongside phallic worship and worship of a male god. One particular seal, termed the Pashupati seal by archaeologists is of interest. It depicts a horned figure, seated in what seems to be a yogic posture or asana, surrounded by an elephant, a buffalo, a tiger and a rhino. It is accepted by some scholar but disputed by others that this horned figure represents a &quot;proto-Shiva&quot;, an early representation of Shiva, the Hindu God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Handbook of Ancient Religions |last=Hinnells|first=|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location= |isbn=9781139461986|page=436-457 |pages= |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FIYiil96ZXAC&amp;lpg=PA435&amp;dq=indus%20phallic%20worship&amp;pg=PA436#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even today, in yogic lore, Shiva is considered the lord of yoga, and the first yogi and guru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.ishafoundation.org/yoga-meditation/history-of-yoga/who-is-shiva-meaning/ |title=Who Is Shiva: Man, Myth or Divine? |author= |date=6 February 2014 |work= |publisher=Isha Blog |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaktism is also found in Harappa, as is the symbol of the swastika, another predominant presence in Hinduism today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Mathematics Extension 1, higher-order inequalities are introduced. I have written down the steps that need to be taken in order to solve these challenging problems. 

When you have a rational function as an inequality (e.g. f(x)/g(x)&gt;a), 
g(x) might be negative, so you cannot simply multiply g(x) by both sides and cancel out. 

Best Method to use is to subtract 'a' to both sides so that you get (f(x)/g(x))-a&gt;0

Rearrange the expression so that there is a common denominator and a single rational function. 

After you rearrange the expression, multiply the denominator by the numerator. This would be your 'sign graph'. Using your polynomial skills learnt from Year 10 Advanced Mathematics, perform a rough sketch of the function. Be sure to write down the 'regions' in which the polynomial is greater than 0 (or less than 0, depending on the question). These would be the solutions to your inequality. 

You would also have to be careful with the original rational function's denominator and see when the function is undefined. For example if the denominator is x+1, -1 should not be in the solution set of the inequality, because the function will be undefined (i.e. it would be a vertical asymptote if you sketch the function). 

Hope this helps!</text>

An '''autorack''', also known as an '''auto carrier''', is a specialized piece of [[railroad]] [[rolling stock]] used to transport unladen [[automobile]]s (unladen in this context refers to automobiles ''without passengers'').

It is widely used to carry new [[automobiles]] and light trucks from the factories to automotive distributors. It is also used for [[Auto Train]] service in the [[United States]].

In the early part of the 20th century, when automobiles were still new technology, their production levels were low enough that they could be shipped in sufficient quantities in [[boxcar]]s. Two to four automobiles would usually fit into one boxcar. But as automobiles grew in size, railroads found that they needed to modify the boxcars for more efficient loading. Some modifications included longer boxcars, larger sliding double side doors located near one end of the boxcar, or doors located on the boxcar ends.

These modifications helped, but the demand for new automobiles outpaced the railroads' abilities to build and modify boxcars in which to ship them. In 1923, the [[Grand Trunk Western Railroad]] experimented with modifying a group of 61-foot-long wood-frame [[flat car]]s to increase their capacity by adding collapsible frames to allow for double-deck operation. The concept was not perfected and therefore failed to gain acceptance. In the 1940s and 1950s, some railroads experimented with automobile loading assemblies that would lift one or more automobile above others within a boxcar for more efficient use of space within the cars. The success of these assemblies was limited due to their special use and specific size; it proved uneconomical to maintain a fleet of these assemblies that could only be loaded into boxcars from the ends of the cars.

By this time, in the United States, most circuses still traveled by rail. Circuses were major haulers of wheeled vehicles, carrying all of their vehicles on [[flat car]]s, usually behind their own [[passenger car (rail)|passenger cars]] or in separate sections of their trains (basically, one train would haul the performers and employees while a second train would haul the vehicles and freight). The circus solution to loading vehicles was to use a string of flat cars. A temporary ramp was placed at the end of the flat cars and temporary bridge plates spanned the gaps between adjacent flat cars; the road vehicles were driven or towed up onto one car and then driven or towed down the train. This type of vehicle loading became known as &quot;circus style&quot; due to its frequent use by circuses.

It wasn't until the 1960s that the majority of railroads took the clue from circuses and started loading their own flat cars in this manner. But, loading even up to six automobiles onto one flat car left a large amount of space above the vehicles that was unused. The natural solution was to take the temporary assemblies that were used to stack and load vehicles within boxcars and permanently attach them to the flat cars. The assemblies, also called racks, created two levels on which automobiles could be loaded. To complete the flat car, foldaway bridges were added to the ends of the flat car decks to allow the vehicles to be driven the entire length of a train for loading. Building flat cars in this manner, the railroads no longer needed specialized equipment to load and unload the racks in boxcars. All they needed now was a ramp at the right height.

In the 1950s, in [[Germany]], [[VW Beetle]] production was increasing beyond the capacity of highway trucks. [[Volkswagen]] engineers worked with German railroads to design a railroad car that was basically an extra long version of a vehicle hauling trailer. The design they came up with was able to carry 10 vehicles on one car. VW's two-level flatcar design effectively became the first autorack.

In late 1957, [[Canadian National Railway|Canadian National]] Railroad (CN) introduced a group of auto carriers which represented a new innovation. The CN bi-level auto-rack cars had ''end-doors.'' They were huge by the standards of the time; the cars were 75 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (23 [[metre|m]]) long and could carry 8 vehicles. These cars were a big success and helped lead to the development of today's enclosed auto racks.

Autoracks quickly lengthened to around 80 ft (24 m) to increase their loading capacity. This made them about as long as the average passenger car of the time; if the cars were much longer, they wouldn't be able to operate in interchange service due to clearance issues on curves. Yet, the railroads could still do better. It didn't take long for the first three-level autoracks to appear on American rails.

During the 1960s, specially built auto carriers took over rail transportation of newly manufactured automobiles in North America. They carried more cars in the same space and were easier to load and unload than the boxcars used earlier. [[Arthur Crookshank]] of the [[New York Central Railroad]] is credited with having the first set of cars manufactured for use in the late 1950s.{{citation needed}} Ever-larger auto carriers and specialized terminals were developed by [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] (N&amp;W) and other carriers. Also in this decade, autoracks were built in three-level configurations so railroads could haul more of the smaller vehicles of the era; two-level autoracks were still in use for [[van]]s and light [[Pickup truck|trucks]].

The only problem left was that the new autorack cars did not provide any protection from flying debris or from the weather. In the manner CN had developed in the 1950s, in the 1970s other North American railroads began refining their autorack cars. They began installing side sheathing to protect the vehicles from impact. Roofs were added to most autoracks in the 1980s, and end doors were added in the latter portion of the decade (both to prevent damage and to deter people from boarding the cars and riding the train within the vehicles loaded in them).

Although railroads were just beginning to see the advantages that autoracks delivered in the 1960s, most North American railroads were reluctant to invest in such specially built equipment. The [[Trailer Train Company]], organized by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and the [[Norfolk &amp; Western]] in 1955, stepped in to ease the railroads' financial burden a bit. Trailer Train purchased the flat cars from the rail car manufacturers, and the railroads that wanted to operate autoracks purchased the racks that were installed on those flat cars. Such cars were easily spotted at trackside due to the reporting marks identifying Trailer Train on the flat car portion of the car and the railroad's logo (usually much larger) in the upper portion of the rack.

[[Image:Autoracks in LA 3-22-99.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Autoracks wait to be unloaded in a [[BNSF Railway]] facility in [[Los Angeles, California]].]]

This arrangement worked so well that nearly every autorack operating in the US was so owned. Trailer Train became [[TTX Corporation]] in 1991; since then many railroads have themselves purchased the flat cars on which the racks were installed and TTX has itself expanded into purchasing and leasing out other railroad [[rolling stock]]. The development of enclosed autoracks also helped make several other innovative services work well.

===New designs and current usage===
Railroads of today are still grappling with the problem of loading more and larger vehicles onto autoracks. One popular solution is to create a double-length car that is articulated over a single middle truck ([[bogie]]) so that each half of the car is about the same length as a conventional autorack. These cars, which can be seen in operation on many of the railroads of the western US, are brand named ''AutoMax'' cars. These cars, built by [[Gunderson]] (a subsidiary of [[The Greenbrier Companies]]) measure 145 ft 4 [[inch|in]] (44.3 m) long and 20 ft 2 in (6 m) tall; they feature adjustable interior decks to carry up to 22 light trucks and minivans.

The railroads became the primary long-distance transporter of completed automobiles, one of few commodities where the industry has been able to overcome trucking in competition. Using the enclosed tri-level autoracks, they were able to provide ''both'' lower costs ''and'' greater protection from in-transit damage (such as that which may occur due to [[weather]] and [[traffic]] conditions on unenclosed [[truck]] [[trailer (vehicle)|trailers]]).

===Latest innovations===
In 2004, [[Canadian National Railway|Canadian National]] was as the forefront of autorack technology again, as it had been in the 1950s by using a more light-weight material, [[aluminium|aluminum]]. The new cars, built by [[Johnstown America Corporation]] beginning in December 2004, are brand named ''AVC'', an acronym for ''Aluminum Vehicle Carrier''. 200 new aluminum autoracks promise a softer ride, a wider interior, superior door-edge protection, and a rust-free interior from older steel versions. [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] has ordered 375 of these new cars as well. The new cars built for [[Amtrak]] [[Auto Train (Amtrak)|Auto Train]] service differ from those built for CN and CP; the Amtrak cars are three inches shorter in height, and use solid side panels instead of the perforated panels operated in freight service.

==Auto Train: combining autoracks and passenger cars==
===Auto-Train Corp: a privately funded innovation===

On [[December 6]], [[1971]] [[Auto-Train Corporation]] introduced a new and innovative rail transportation service for ''both'' passengers ''and'' their automobiles in the United States, operating scheduled service between [[Lorton, Virginia]] (near [[Washington, D.C.]]) and [[Sanford, Florida]], near [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].

The [[Auto-Train Corporation|Auto Train]] offered an alternative to motorists who would otherwise drive their automobiles the 855-[[mile]] (1375 [[kilometer|km]]) distance along the east coast of the U.S. For vacationers with destinations at one or more of the many popular tourist attractions of Florida, the [[Auto-Train Corporation|Auto Train]] service offered dual features:

 &lt;font color=magenta&gt;A numbered list (using # at the beginning of the line)
   ↓↓&lt;/font&gt;
|}
# avoid the long automobile ride on busy [[Interstate 95]] in [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Florida]]
# have the convenience of use of their own automobile upon arrival.

From the beginning in 1971 (the same year [[Amtrak]] began service on purely passenger routes in the US), a key feature of [[Auto-Train Corporation|Auto-Train]]'s new service was the use of autoracks, which were former [[Canadian National Railway|Canadian National]] bi-level autorack cars acquired used. These were augmented by new tri-level auto-racks in 1976.

The privately owned service became very popular, but after 10 years of operation, and some costly attempts to expand the service elsewhere (such as a schedule between Florida and [[Chicago, Illinois]]), Auto-Train Corporation entered bankruptcy, and service ended in April 1981.

===''Amtrak's Auto Train: federally sponsored service''===
Auto Train service between Virginia and Florida was resumed by [[Amtrak]] in 1983. Amtrak, a federally chartered corporation which operates most intercity passenger trains in the United States, continued to use Auto-Train's autoracks as an important portion of its service.

In current operation of Amtrak's [[Auto Train (Amtrak)|Auto Train]], there are two trains in operation simultaneously. The autoracks normally run on the rear of Auto Train [[consist]]s, which stretch over a quarter-mile, and are a familiar sight on [[CSX Transportation|CSX]] trackage along the east coast.

Today, Amtrak's Auto Train carries about 200,000 passengers and generates around $50 million in revenue annually. It is considered Amtrak's best-paying train in terms of income in comparison with operating expenses.

==Alaska Railroad: Service through a long one-lane tunnel==
An Auto Train type of service utilizing autoracks and [[passenger car (rail)|passenger cars]] was operated in Alaska at the [[Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel]] through [[Maynard Mountain]] near [[Whittier, Alaska]], which is part of the [[Portage Glacier Highway]].
Completed in 1943, with a length of 13,300 feet (4054 [[m]]), it is the longest [[highway]] [[tunnel]] and longest combined rail and highway tunnel in [[North America]].

In the mid-1960s, the [[Alaska Railroad]] began offering a shuttle service through the tunnel which allowed vehicles to drive onto auto carrier cars to be transported between Whittier and the former town of Portage. As traffic to Whittier increased, the shuttle became insufficient, leading to a project to convert the existing railroad tunnel into a one-lane, combination highway and railway tunnel which was opened to traffic on [[June 7]], [[2000]].

'''Trainz Stations''' are interactive 'Industry class' assets that use people, albeit digital people, as products. Passenger Cars are the complementary rolling stock assets which transport that product. The implementation of such products in Trainz depends on hidden smoke and mirrors of TrainzScript, and properly designed assets with a sufficiency of mesh {{TG|A|attachment point}}s.

There are a wide variety of Train Station assets on the DLS and available through third party software vendors. Moreover, there is a wide variety of so-called invisible platforms which with suitable detailing allow most any building to be made into an interactive station. Trains stations inside a session like other interactive industries need be told what to do, so this page will deal with that bit of programming in the game. 
----
==Module Goals==
By working through this material, the student will learn:
# Station Industries, glitz and glitter aside as like any other interactive {{TL|Industries|Trainz Industries}}.
# Optional asset selection approaches and technologies for setting up Station Industries.
# Gain an understanding of Interactive Stations
# Gather an understanding of Dummy Stations,
## and how to upgrade them when modifying an older gem of a route using invisible platforms.
## Some tricks to substitute or mask or combine components of several technologies to get an desired 3D model. 
# Master programming of Interactive Stations, when to do that in what layer, and so forth.

==Dummy Station Components==
In the beginner, before the Lord created the heaven's and the Earth...
Stations in Trainz had the same humble beginning as dummy industries of any kind. Content Creators put together a set of likely looking scenery items, built up some splines objects of various appearances to act as platforms (each adroitly side stepped having stairs or steps by using ramps) and with the use of a few {{TG|T|Trackmarks}} the primitive AI programability that was added into the {{TG|S|Scenarios}} technology (Trainz UTC, v1.5) a scenario designer/writer could generate traffic for a human operator to sometimes interact with. Compared to what is possible with the much more highly evolved Trainz of today, there wasn't a lot of capabilities to exploit.
# Likely looking building
# Track with signalling
# Track mark on Tracks to interact with AI drivers and triggers for sensing control
# Station platform, either of the {{kp|F3}} tools ''''O'''bjects': {{kp|F3}},{{kp|O}}  or ''''S'''pline scenery assets': {{kp|F3}},{{kp|S}} groups.

      <comment>/* Freebase API Key */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You would like a standardized set of tools for getting a list of all collections and resources and for resources that match specific patterns or have specific mime-types.

There are several functions that allow you to do a fast scan utility functions for each resource (file or collection) or just collections.  Each of these functions have two arguments, one for the starting collection and the other is a callback function that can be used to filter out unwanted matches.

   dbutil:scan(xs:anyURI($collection as xs:anyURI, $func as function($collection-path as xs:anyURI, $full-file-path as xs:anyURI?)) as item()*)
   dbutil:scan-resources($collection as xs:anyURI, $func as function(xs:anyURI) as item()*)
   dbutil:scan-collections($collection as xs:anyURI), $func as function(xs:anyURI) as item()*)
   dbutil:find-by-mimetype($collection as xs:anyURI, $mimeType as xs:string)
   dbutil:find-by-mimetype($collection as xs:anyURI, $mimeType as xs:string, $func as function(xs:anyURI)

These are all small XQuery functions and can be found at:

$EXIST_HOME/webapp/WEB-INF/data/expathrepo/shared-0.3.1/content/dbutils.xql

== Example of Scan ==
The following example uses the scan() function to get a list of all the resources in the collection that end with the suffix 'xunit.xq' - which is a script that returns the results in XUnit test result format.

=== Sample Code ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
import module namespace dbutil=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/dbutil&quot;;

let $root-collection := '/db'
let $file-suffix := 'xunit.xq'

let $find-file-path :=
  (: This function MUST have two parameters, the first is the collection path, the second is the FULL path to a resource.
     Note that the second parameter must be able to be optional.  :)
  function($collection as xs:anyURI, $full-path-to-resource as xs:anyURI?) {
    if (ends-with($full-path-to-resource, $file-suffix))
        then
          $full-path-to-resource
        else ()
     }
     
  return
  &lt;results&gt;
      {for $resource in dbutil:scan(xs:anyURI($root-collection), $find-file-path)
      return
         &lt;resource&gt;{$resource}&lt;/resource&gt;
       }
  &lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Sample Results ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;resource&gt;/db/apps/myapp/unit-tests/scan-xunit.xq&lt;/resource&gt;
   &lt;resource&gt;/db/apps/myapp/unit-tests/scan-collection-xunit.xq&lt;/resource&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example of Scan Collection ==
The following example uses the scan-collection() function to get a list of all collection paths
that end with the string &quot;/unit-tests&quot;.

=== Source Code ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

import module namespace dbutil=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/dbutil&quot;;

let $root-collection := '/db'
let $leaf-collection-to-find := '/unit-tests'

let $find-leaf-function :=
  function($root-collection as xs:anyURI) {
  if (ends-with($root-collection, $leaf-collection-to-find))
   then
     $root-collection
   else ()
}
  return
  &lt;results&gt;
      {for $collection in dbutil:scan-collections(xs:anyURI($root-collection), $find-leaf-function)
      return
         &lt;collection&gt;{$collection}&lt;/collection&gt;
       }
  &lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Results ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;collection&gt;/db/apps/skos/unit-tests&lt;/collection&gt;
   &lt;collection&gt;/db/apps/graph2svg/unit-tests&lt;/collection&gt;
   &lt;collection&gt;/db/apps/eco-meta/unit-tests&lt;/collection&gt;
   &lt;collection&gt;/db/nosql/unit-tests&lt;/collection&gt;
   &lt;collection&gt;/db/nosql/apps/make-docx/unit-tests&lt;/collection&gt;
   &lt;collection&gt;/db/nosql/apps/docbook-to-docx/unit-tests&lt;/collection&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Other Followup Notes ==
Again it illustrates how to obtain information from Freebase via it's
MQL language (it predated Sparql).

The previous query was taken from

 https://developers.google.com/freebase/v1/mql-overview

and it limits the data that results from the call to the Freebase API.
You can see a limit parameter being set to 3 below in the API call.

 https://www.googleapis.com/freebase/v1/mqlread?query=[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;/music/album&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:null,&quot;artist&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;/en/bob_dylan&quot;},&quot;limit&quot;:3}]&amp;cursor

If you do not specify a limit with your API call, Freebase will impose
a limit of 100 records on your query. This message addresses the
question of how to get everything.

The key to doing this is dangling at the end of the above API call,
it's the cursor parameter and it's usage is discussed with an example
here

   https://developers.google.com/freebase/v1/mql-overview#querying-with-cursor-paging-results

To summarise you ask for a cursor (see the example API call above for
the form of the initial request) to be returned with your query
results which acts as a link to the next set of query results. You
obtain that next set by supplying the value of the cursor returned
from the previous invocation. Along with that next set you get another
cursor that points to the set after that. When the final set of
results are retrieved the cursor returns a string value of false (the
Freebase overview has this in upper case but my code  used lower case
'false' and that works).

The overview has sample Python code which I have not tried or parsed
in anger but which I believe invokes libraries that take care of all
the cursor handling for you.

   https://developers.google.com/freebase/v1/mql-overview#looping-through-cursor-results

However the same thing can easily be achieved from XQuery with a
little bit of tail recursion.

We will use as an example a MQL query that returns all films with
their netflix_id's.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
[{
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;/film/film&quot;,
  &quot;name&quot;: null,
  &quot;netflix_id&quot;: []
}]
&lt;/source&gt;

A few brief comments about MQL. You ask for something by giving the
field name and a value null. Null gets replaced by the actual value.
However if the field can have multiple values MQL will return an array
and cause your null query to error. This may happen even when you are
expecting a singular value so you can avoid this problem by using the
symbol for an empty array instead of null as in the query above.

You can paste the query above into

   http://www.freebase.com/query

to see the results (we will take care of the cursor in the code example).

Now to the code, which assumes XQuery 3.0

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;3.0&quot;;

import module namespace xqjson=&quot;http://xqilla.sourceforge.net/lib/xqjson&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Freebase returns JSON but we want to store this in an xml db so we use
the above package for json to XML conversion. From eXist you can
install the package by just clicking it on the eXist Package Manager
which you can get to from the eXist Dashboard.

We declare a variable for our query.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare variable $mqlQuery {'[{
   &quot;type&quot;: &quot;/film/film&quot;,
  &quot;name&quot;: null,
  &quot;netflix_id&quot;: []
}]'};

declare variable $freebase {'https://www.googleapis.com/freebase/v1/mqlread'};
declare variable $key {obtain an API key from freebase and puts it's
value here'};
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Power circuits and hazards: hazardous voltages; fuses and circuit breakers; grounding; lightning protection; battery safety; electrical code compliance'''

Amateur Radio Operators occasionally need to handle items that are energized with high voltages or have enormous amounts of energy stored in them.  Such powerful sources must always be handled with care to prevent serious accidents from occurring.

'''Human Health.'''  There is a misconception that &quot;voltage kills&quot;, but this is actually untrue considering that we may become charged with tens of thousands of volts simply by handling a latex balloon while wearing a woolen sweater.  We must rely on the truth that &quot;current kills&quot;.  It only takes between 10-100ma to trigger muscle spasms, disrupt cellular activity or cause the burning of flesh do to Ohmic heating.  Always assume that we are at earth potential of zero volts and that all higher voltages will induce a current through us.

'''AC Power Sources.'''  North American electrical service in a modern structure has three wires delivered to your receptacle.  Inside this receptacle, these three conductors are a green wire for Ground, a white wire for Neutral and a wire of a different color for the Hot.  Traditionally Hot is a black wire, but that isn't a requirement.  The Hot should never be a white or green wire as those are reserved exclusively for Neutral or Ground.  It is always worthwhile to test that your house is wired and grounded correctly before setting up your ham shack or lab bench.

AC sources provide a maximum current that is determined by the cross-sectional dimension of the wire.  Because the conductors have a resistance, current flow would cause heat to be released.  Typically the heat is released in junctions where wires are fastened together as those regions have the highest resistance.  The NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) has done extensive research to create an elegant set of rules for correct dimensioning and insulation of conductors.  Overcurrent conditions that can cause heating of the conductor are mitigated with a circuit breaker (or fuses for pre-1960 installations).

The circuit breakers, or fuses, primarily serve the goal of preventing fires, but our additional green ground wire provides a human safety benefit.  Lets say the Hot wire comes loose inside your appliance and the metal frame becomes energized, it is a shock hazard.  A grounded appliance will bleed this voltage to ground potential of zero volts.  This typically results in an over current where a circuit breaker trips or a fuse blows.

When a circuit breaker trips or a fuse burns out, interpret that as a warning.  You have just prevented a fire or electrocution by a safety feature being activated.  When you defeat these systems by installing an over-dimensioned breaker or fuse, you are defeating safety features that solely exist to protect life and limb.  Always determine the cause of an incident.  If you don't have an exact replacement, it is acceptable to use a smaller dimensioned protection at the risk of a nuisance tripping that rapidly reduces the life of a breaker.

Current flow in an AC system is between two conductors, the Hot and Neutral.  The Hot alternates between a high positive potential and a high negative potential and the Neutral is the return path for the electron flow.  There are a number of high quality technologies that provide greater protection for the user.  Arc-Fault breakers contain an embedded system that measures current flow and disables the current flow if it detects what appears to be arcing in the load.  GFCI breakers, are Ground Fault Current Interrupting where if more that 20ma is unaccounted for in the flow between Hot and Neutral, the current flow is shut off.  Some companies, such as E-T-A, even produce circuit breakers that are drop in replacements for fuses and will fit in the existing holders.

'''Battery Sources.'''  These are particularly dangerous as they can deliver much higher currents that AC electrical service.  A lead-acid battery from a car can easily deliver hundreds of amperes of current.  This enormous current capability means that an incredible amount of heating can occur during a short circuit.  There are instances of screwdrivers melting after being sec upon the terminals of the batter.  The same current that passes through the short circuit also passes through the battery and ohmic heating can rapidly overheat the battery.  Treat the battery with the same amount of care as you would a fuel canister.  The same energy that can power your transmitter over the course of an afternoon can also start a fire within seconds.

I am guilty of short circuiting a car battery on one occasion.  In this case a solar cell was charging the battery.  While unplugging the solar cell, the terminals landed on each other.  Immediately, the entire wire turned to a very beautiful smoke cloud that rose straight up (and very uniformly) across the entire length of wire.  Each loop the wires made across the floor made perfect smoke rings as well.

Some components such as inductors, transformers and certain electric motors must never be attached to batteries as they will quickly become short circuited once the magnetic fields are created.

When batteries overheat, either through overcharging or over current, the water in the battery will separate into molecular oxygen and hydrogen.  These gases are violently explosive in their mutual presence, not to mention, already heated due to current flow.  An outgassing battery is an explosion hazard, especially if it's outgassing faster than pressure can be released.  Disconnect a noisy battery and ventilate the room to dissipate the gases.

==The Question Pool==
===Question 1===
;Which of the following is a safety hazard of a 12-volt storage battery?
:A. Touching both terminals with the hands can cause electrical shock
:B. Shorting the terminals can cause burns, fire, or an explosion
:C. RF emissions from the battery
:D. All of these choices are correct
&lt;br&gt;
The voltage is harmless, but the short circuit current can be enormous.  Ohm's Law tells us that heat released is proportional to the current squared.  Each time the current doubles, the power output multiplies by four.  '''The correct answer is B.'''
===Question 2===
;How does current flowing through the body cause a health hazard?
:A. By heating tissue
:B. It disrupts the electrical functions of cells
:C. It causes involuntary muscle contractions
:D. All of these choices are correct
&lt;br&gt;
All these things can happen.  Ohmic heating of tissue and involuntary muscular contractions are often associated with electrical injuries.  Cellular damage can also occur due to a potential difference across the cell.  '''The correct answer is D.'''
===Question 3===
;What is connected to the green wire in a three-wire electrical AC plug?
:A. Neutral
:B. Hot
:C. Safety ground
:D. The white wire
&lt;br&gt;
Green is a reserved color for ground.  Don't ever use it for any other purpose.  The ground is a return path for current in case a wiring fault makes an appliance hot, so that the breaker may trip if it draws enough current.  '''The correct answer is C.'''
===Question 4===
;What is the purpose of a fuse in an electrical circuit?
:A. To prevent power supply ripple from damaging a circuit
:B. To interrupt power in case of overload
:C. To limit current to prevent shocks
:D. All of these choices are correct
&lt;br&gt;
The fuse is equivalent in application as a circuit breakers as the protect from over-current situations.  They prevent fires, not shocks.  '''The correct answer is B.'''
===Question 5===
;Why is it unwise to install a 20-ampere fuse in the place of a 5-ampere fuse?
:A. The larger fuse would be likely to blow because it is rated for higher current
:B. The power supply ripple would greatly increase
:C. Excessive current could cause a fire
:D. All of these choices are correct
&lt;br&gt;
The components and wiring and specified for a 5 ampere fuse.  If you exceed that current, you will have excessive heating which would be a fire hazard.  In this case, the current is allowed to flow four times the specified max, which means ohmic losses will be squared, sixteen times as much heat will be dissipated.  '''The correct answer is C.'''
===Question 6===
;What is a good way to guard against electrical shock at your station?
:A. Use three-wire cords and plugs for all AC powered equipment
:B. Connect all AC powered station equipment to a common safety ground
:C. Use a circuit protected by a ground-fault interrupter
:D. All of these choices are correct
&lt;br&gt;
Ground Fault Breakers save lives.  Rumor has it you still feel the shock, but they interrupt before harm is done.  Properly grounded equipment ensures the potential of the housing is at earth potential of zero volts.  All grounds should be connected to each other to prevent potential difference between grounds.  '''The correct answer is D.'''
===Question 7===
;Which of these precautions should be taken when installing devices for lightning protection in a coaxial cable feed line?
:A. Include a parallel bypass switch for each protector so that it can be switched out of the circuit when running high power
:B. Include a series switch in the ground line of each protector to prevent RF overload from inadvertently damaging the protector
:C. Keep the ground wires from each protector separate and connected to station ground
:D. Ground all of the protectors to a common plate which is in turn connected to an external ground
&lt;br&gt;
Keep all your ground conductors connected.  Lightning strikes have enormous voltages and can deliver enormous currents.  In most cases, the grounds may have a small voltage across them, but during a lightning strike, these voltages can reach into the thousands of volts and that is a fire hazard.  Even if the strike isn't direct, it's possible for the ground wires to act as antennas and become highly charged. Keep your grounds connected.  '''The correct answer is D.'''
===Question 8===
;What safety equipment should always be included in home-built equipment that is powered from 120V AC power circuits?
:A. A fuse or circuit breaker in series with the AC hot conductor
:B. An AC voltmeter across the incoming power source
:C. An inductor in series with the AC power source
:D. A capacitor across the AC power source
&lt;br&gt;
Circuit breakers will restrict over-currents to the smaller components that could otherwise combust during a runaway failure.  '''The correct answer is A.'''
===Question 9===
;What kind of hazard is presented by a conventional 12-volt storage battery?
:A. It emits ozone which can be harmful to the atmosphere
:B. Shock hazard due to high voltage
:C. Explosive gas can collect if not properly vented
:D. All of these choices are correct
&lt;br&gt;
Hydrogen and Oxygen are both released from the water in a battery.  Two dangerous gases in a heated, sealed container.  '''The correct answer is C.'''
===Question 10===
;What can happen if a lead-acid storage battery is charged or discharged too quickly?
:A. The battery could overheat and give off flammable gas or explode
:B. The voltage can become reversed
:C. The memory effect will reduce the capacity of the battery
:D. All of these choices are correct
&lt;br&gt;
The excessive current will heat the battery rapidly.  The same current that is being delivered is also flowing through the battery.  '''The correct answer is A.'''
===Question 11===
;What kind of hazard might exist in a power supply when it is turned off and disconnected?
:A. Static electricity could damage the grounding system
:B. Circulating currents inside the transformer might cause damage
:C. The fuse might blow if you remove the cover
:D. You might receive an electric shock from the charged stored in large capacitors
&lt;br&gt;
Some of the components can store energy long after the appliance is disconnected from power.  Observe the voltage rating on the capacitors to get a hint on if the voltage is one you feel is dangerous.  Remember, some metal capacitors may have energized cans around them.  Typically these have plastic sleeves, but they also fall off or disappear.  Glass or foil capacitors may have a very long self discharge time.  Be careful discharging these because they can provide enormous currents; always use a resistor to discharge.  '''The correct answer is D.'''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''RE GAMING''' Hey! I'm aware you have been working on a gaming section for the WikiBook. I'm working on the Dishinibition effect specifically and breaking it down into smaller contributory factors - I've come across the contributory factor of &quot;dissociative imagination&quot; which comes into play within Gaming. Would you link up our ideas? I could post an internal term link to &quot;gaming&quot; in the section directing to your section when you have finished writing it and posted it and you could mention the dissociative imagination I have written about in the gaming section. Linking our similar ideas would really make the page flow well together! Drop me a line on my page!

Hi Elizabeth! One person from our group just created another user page like the one we all have (ie. mine is BobblehatImara; yours is ButtonsElizabeth) and named it after the group. We all post on the discussion page of that, like I am posting on your discussion page now. Just make sure that the creator of the page logs off of that and back on to their individual user page, or else Greg will not be able to track their posts on the page. Hope this helps!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Mutual Recursion==
I would not connect mutual recursion in this way with

happen with single recursion. Its rather the case
that sometimes, in bigger projects, mutual recursion
naturally comes up.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lots of presentation discussion to be had! [[User:WikiLeaksGroup|WikiLeaksGroup]] ([[User talk:WikiLeaksGroup|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/WikiLeaksGroup|contribs]]) 20:38, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

==Facebook==
Discussion Copied from Facebook, 18th March-24th of March:

Claire Porter: If you's meet the keep me up to date and I'll try by some miracle to contribute from ny x

Kasia Peel: sorry i completely didn't realise i'd been added to this group! but i think by the looks of things we are contributing on a sort of individual basis for the wiki and discussing it with the other group on the wiki discussion page. my page it RedGebsKasia, so since we get marked for our contributions we could always chat on their as me and elizabeth have been. then i think its more the presentation stuff that we will have to be meeting up for since we actually do that together 

Kasia Peel: i should be able to still meet up also, on monday i have a break between 1 and 2?

Elizabeth Ross: I can do between 1 and 2 too, but we should definitely try and meet up. Is there a different time that would suit on Monday, maybe after 4pm?

Caroline Grace Malcolm: I can do after 4

Debbie Morrison: Yes, great idea! Where….? x

Elizabeth Ross: Shall we meet in social study? Kasia and I might be a bit late due to the film screening, but not too much.

Elizabeth Ross:  I was looking at the topics covered so far and I don't think anyone is really covering the sense of belonging one can get through online groups and communities. Do you think we should look at this? I already have a few notes.
Obviously we can talk about it more tomorrow but just something to think about.

Discussion Copied from Facebook, 31st of March:

Claire Porter: Booked a group study room for 12 on thursday, should all get an email sent to you about it. 

Caroline Grace Malcolm: I will get there at about 12:15 and need to leave at 1:45 because of classes but that should be ok

Claire Porter: Also its room 10 by the way

== Presentations ==

Just some stuff to maybe think about ahead of us meeting up tomorrow. I wrote a good chunk of the SNSs section and so was maybe thinking we could do a group exercise on their Facebook or social media usage, getting everyone to discuss how they are affected by impression management, blurred boundaries ect and maybe see if they have examples to share. We could get the ball rolling by doing it ourselves first, or at least one of us.

I also think we should try and link in as much of our real life experience as possible to make the presentation as engaging and interesting as possible. [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 20:55, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

And this might be a good video to start the whole presentation with- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10K137WU9gw [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 21:10, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xua1JXd5pK0. I think this one we could reflect on just how big a deal online identity is if there are web blogs and videos giving advice. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGFF8lJM8mk. And I thought this one highlights really well a lot of the points that have been brought up throughout the whole page, not just SNSs [[User:ButtonsElizabeth|ButtonsElizabeth]] ([[User talk:ButtonsElizabeth|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ButtonsElizabeth|contribs]]) 21:22, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

We should brainstorm using the topics we have covered and (I agree) personal experience. Then we can decide which ideas will work best given the time frame and environment. [[User:Debsi91|Debsi91]] ([[User talk:Debsi91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Debsi91|contribs]]) 10:11, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Was really happy with our meeting today, lots of progress made! Just to confirm on time allocation for each person in the belonging section it was two minutes yeah, before I start writing my part on fan culture? [[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 15:38, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I am having an issue with this section that when I post something it wont save or appear [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 15:39, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Two minutes is perfect. I think I have finished with my section, I am worried it is a little on the short side but I don't want to waffle. Any feedback would be appreciated if you can think of anything positive/negative. Presentations ahoy! [[User:Debsi91|Debsi91]] ([[User talk:Debsi91|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Debsi91|contribs]]) 23:58, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

Ok I just managed to save something. I think today went really well and our content is good. I think come Monday it will be more clear because we can start creating the official presentation and practice our deliverance. I also think it is really important that we ensure that the presentation is well organised and set out in a logical way that is purposeful in order that it does not look messy. But I think come Monday we can make sure that happens as we pull together all the work and create the final piece. [[User:Caroline Malcolm|Caroline Malcolm]] ([[User talk:Caroline Malcolm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Caroline Malcolm|contribs]]) 15:42, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I agree, once we have all of our own content prepared for the presentation I think it should fit together nicely. [[User:Clairepporter|Clairepporter]] ([[User talk:Clairepporter|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Clairepporter|contribs]]) 15:44, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

I think roughly two minutes will be good. Our mock run through on Monday will help though. Is everyone happy with what they have to write, or shall I put up the rough order sheet document we were working on today?

__TOC__
&lt;/div&gt;


The ALTER TABLE command modifies column definitions and table constraints 'on the fly'. This means existing definitions are extended, changed or deleted or existing data is casted to a different type or existing data is evaluated against the new definitions.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot; style=&quot;background:LightGreen&quot;&gt;
-- change column definitions
ALTER TABLE &lt;table_name&gt; { ADD | ALTER } [ COLUMN ] &lt;column_name&gt; &lt;column_definition&gt;;
ALTER TABLE &lt;table_name&gt; { DROP        } [ COLUMN ] &lt;column_name&gt;;

-- change table constraints
ALTER TABLE &lt;table_name&gt; { ADD | ALTER } CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint_name&gt; &lt;constraint_definition&gt;;
ALTER TABLE &lt;table_name&gt; { DROP        } CONSTRAINT &lt;constraint_name&gt;;
&lt;/source&gt;

The following examples are based on the test table ''t1''.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE t1 (
  id         NUMERIC  PRIMARY KEY,
  col_1      CHAR(4)
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Columns ==
The syntax of the ADD COLUMN and ALTER COLUMN phrases are similar to the one shown in the [[Structured_Query_Language/Create_Table#Column_Definition|create table page]].

=== Add a Column ===
Existing tables can be extended by additional columns with the ADD COLUMN phrase. Within this phrase all options of the original Create Table statement are available: data type, default value, NOT NULL, Primary Key, Unique, Foreign Key, Check.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
-- add a new column with any characteristic
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN col_2 VARCHAR(100) CHECK (length(col_2) &gt; 5);  -- Oracle: The key word 'COLUMN' is not allowed.
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Alter the Characteristic of a Column ===
With the ALTER COLUMN phrase some characteristics of an existing column can be changed
:*data type
:*DEFAULT clause
:*NOT NULL clause.
The new definitions must be compatible with the old existing data. If you change for example the data type from VARCHAR to NUMERIC this action can only be successful if it is possible to cast '''all''' existing VARCHAR data to NUMERIC - the casting of 'xyz' will fail. Casting in the direction from NUMERIC to VARCHAR will be successful as long as the width of the VARCHAR is large enought to store the result.

Hint: Concerning the change of the characteristics of columns some implementations ignore the syntax of the SQL standard and use other keywords like 'MODIFY'.

==== Change the Data Type ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER COLUMN col_1 SET DATA TYPE NUMERIC;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Change the DEFAULT Clause ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER COLUMN col_1 SET DEFAULT 'n/a';
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Change the NOT NULL Clause ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER COLUMN col_1 SET  NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER COLUMN col_1 DROP NOT NULL;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Drop a Column ===
Columns can be dropped from existing tables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE t1 DROP COLUMN col_2;    -- Oracle: The key word 'COLUMN' is mandatory.
&lt;/source&gt;

Hint: As an extention to the SQL standard some implementations offer a RENAME or SET INVISIBLE command.

== Table Constraints ==
Table constraints can be added, modified or dropped. The syntax is similar to that shown on the [[Structured_Query_Language/Create_Table#Table_Constraint|create table page]].

=== Add a Table Constraint ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD CONSTRAINT t1_col_1_unique UNIQUE (col_1);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Alter a Table Constraint ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE t1 ALTER CONSTRAINT t1_col_1_unique UNIQUE (col_1);
&lt;/source&gt;

Hint: Concerning the change of table constraints some implementations ignore the syntax of the SQL standard and use other keywords like 'MODIFY'.

=== Drop a Table Constraint ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE t1 DROP CONSTRAINT t1_col_1_unique;  -- MySQL: Not supported. There is only a 'DROP FOREIGN KEY'.
&lt;/source&gt;

Hint: As an extention to the SQL standard some implementations offer an ENABLE / DISABLE command for constraints.

== Exercises ==

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Add a column 'col_3' to the table 't1': numeric, not null.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN col_3 NUMERIC NOT NULL;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

&lt;div style=background:gold&gt;
Add a Foreign Key from table 't1' column 'col_3' to table 'person' column 'id'.
&lt;/div&gt;
{{ExerciseSolution|width=100%|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD CONSTRAINT t1_col_3_fk FOREIGN KEY (col_3) REFERENCES person (id);
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The DROP TABLE command removes the definition and all data of the named table from the database.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot; style=&quot;background:LightGreen&quot;&gt;
DROP TABLE &lt;t1&gt;;
&lt;/source&gt;

The command handles the table as a whole. It will not fire any trigger. But it considers [[Structured_Query_Language/Foreign_Key#DROP_TABLE_.2F_TRUNCATE_TABLE|Foreign Key definitions]]. If any other table referes to the table to be dropped, the DROP TABLE command will fail. The Foreign Key definition must be [[Structured_Query_Language/Alter_Table#Drop_a_Table_Constraint|dropped]] first.

As the DROP TABLE command handles the table as a whole, it is very fast.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= The Live-CD =
The GNU Health Demo Database is available as Live-CD. This gives interested users the option to run GNU Health on their own PC, and, if desired, install the GNU Health demo database directly from the CD.&lt;br /&gt;
Similar as the demo database, the live-CD is an ongoing project and it will be adapting to the each new GNU Health version. The clinical history will also grow with time.

== Download the Live-CD ==
The Live-CD was built on [https://susestudio.com/ SUSEStudio], and is currently available with the following flavours:
* openSUSE 13.1 / KDE4 / 32bit: [https://susestudio.com/appliance/edit/1083253 GNU Health 2.4.1]
* openSUSE 13.1 / KDE4 / 32bit: [https://susestudio.com/a/7hReQg/gnu-health-2-6-kde-4-32bit GNU Health 2.6]

Unlike the full version of openSUSE, the Live-CD contains only packages that are required to run GNU Health. Feel free to add required programs later on from the openSUSE repositories

== Install the Live-CD ==
In order to use the Live-CD, you have to install it on a CD or a USB stick. 

=== USB-Stick / Hard Disk Image ===
The hard disk image comes as packed raw format. After download, first unpack the *.tar.gz file

* On Linux/Mac-OS, use your favorite archiving program, or use 'tar -xvzf *tar.gz' from the command line
* On Windows, use an advanced packer like 7-Zip

After unpacking, you have to install the RAW-file to a stick. [http://en.opensuse.org/Live_USB_stick See instructions].

Note: When booting the first time from the USB-Stick, the boot process takes a bit longer, as the stick is being optimized (data and swap space creation). Second boot will be much quicker.

=== ISO-Image / CD ===
If you have downloaded the ISO image to burn a CD, you can find the relevant instructions [http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Download_help#Burn_the_ISO_image.28s.29 here].

== Install the Live-CD to your hard drive ==
The Live-CD offers the option to install the system and the GNU Health Demo-DB to your hard drive. The relevant program can be found in the 'My Computer' Section of the start menu (the little green button on the lower left corner of the screen).

= Virtual Machine Images =
The live-CD is available in various container formats that allow easy integration into a virtual environment. Currently the following formats are published:

* Xen Guest (.img)
* OVF Virtual Machine / ESXI (.ovf)
* VMware Workstation / VirtualBox (.vmdk)
* SUSE Cloud / OpenStack / KVM (.qcow2)
* Hyper-V Virtual Hard Disk (.vhd)

== Running the Virtual Machine as Server ==
Several times the question came up 'How can I access my Live-CD from another desktop'? This should not be too difficult if you consider some points. The following example bases on Virtualbox, but should be similar on other virtual environments:
* When setting up the network, make sure you select 'Bridged Network'. In this case the virtual box will receive the IP-Address from your DHCP-Server, not from the host-machine
* Make sure the network-name of your virtual box is updated to your DDNS-Server. Even better, you may assign a fix network address to your virtual box, say 192.168.2.100
* Try to ping the box from an external client on the network: open a console and type: ping 192.168.2.100
* If this works, and your GNUHealth server is running, check if you can access the server from outside: telnet 192.168.2.100 8000 &lt;br /&gt; If this works, everything is good.&lt;br /&gt;If not, its time to check the firewall settings of your box. From the Start Menu, select System -&gt; Administration -&gt; YaST. Enter the password for 'root': tryton , and go to 'firewall Settings'. Check the external zone (right interface name?) or even add an exception for the 192.168.2.100/24 network

== Adjustmends==
*   You may want to change the language and keyboard to your preferred setting. From the Start Menu, select System -&gt; Administration -&gt; YaST. Enter the password for 'root': tryton . You have reached the administration settings. From the 'System' Section select 'Language' to change the primary language.
*  You may want to run an online update. From the Start Menu, select System -&gt; Administration -&gt; YaST. Enter the password for 'root': tryton . You have reached the administration settings. From the 'Software' Section select 'Online-Update'.
*  You may want to install additional software. From the Start Menu, select System -&gt; Administration -&gt; YaST. Enter the password for 'root': tryton . You have reached the administration settings. From the 'Software' Section select 'Software Management'.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">David Lappa was a long-term employee at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory], a nuclear weapons lab primarily funded by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy Department of Energy (DOE)]. Lappa blew the whistle on deliberate mishandling of plutonium at the facility. The subsequent retaliation from his colleagues became so severe that he eventually left the lab. David Lappa's experience is similar to the mistreatment of other whistleblowers at DOE facilities. These cases are symptoms of the culture at DOE, but they also share common elements with whistleblowing cases in all organizations.

[[File:LLNL Aerial View.jpg|thumb|left|border|Aerial View of the Lawrence Livermore National Labratory]]David Lappa worked as an engineer at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)] at the University of California for 19 years. In the summer of 1997, he was appointed to an Internal Investigation Committee that examined the safe handling of nuclear materials at the facility.  He was investigating the storage of plutonium, one of the most toxic substances on Earth.  Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh calculated that a single pound of plutonium could kill 2 million people if spread in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/chapter13.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lappa was surprised to find that lab employees were storing excessive amounts of plutonium in closed handling platforms called glove boxes.  This created a danger of a criticality event, in which the plutonium would spontaneously explode and release lethal amounts of radiation.  Lappa wrote a report detailing his findings and recommended that immediate action be taken to correct the problem.  When Lappa sent this to his superiors, he discovered that the safety violations were intentional.  He was told to ignore them and to sign off on a report stating that no violations occurred. When Lappa refused to sign, he was subjected to coercion, intimidation, and open discrimination at the lab.  He was secretly given negative job performance feedback, had his pay reduced, and was denied a transfer. He was also placed in an assignment with no prospects for advancement, was later moved to a windowless office formerly used as a storage closet. Finally, his supervisor told him that management was working to fire him.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Marylia (1998). U.S.A.: Whistle Blower Wins. World Information Service on Energy&lt;/ref&gt;  That same supervisor was caught removing Lappa’s name with white-out from the report he refused to sign, saying “I’ll be damned if there’s going to be a blank signature line on the cover of this thing.”  Lappa eventually filed a discrimination complaint with the Department of Labor, which began a three year legal battle.  This ended in 2000, when Lappa quit his job out of stress and exhaustion and immigrated to Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;senate&quot; /&gt;

Throughout this episode, DOE failed to fulfill its responsibilities to Lappa.  First, DOE deliberately neglected to investigate any of Lappa's claims about mishandling of plutonium for several months.  Secondly, once DOE confirmed that Lappa's claims were correct, it waived $153,000 in safety violation fines that it should have levied against LLNL. Third, it systematically resisted Lappa’s requests to gain access to public documents and to DOE investigators, which hindered his civil action suit and forced him to sue.  Finally, DOE spent over $300,000 of taxpayer money on legal fees against Lappa.&lt;ref name=&quot;senate&quot; /&gt;

Lappa's case is not unique in DOE, and DOE administration is aware of the problem. Two years before Lappa joined the Investigation Committee, in the summer of 1995, Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary enacted a series of reforms she called the &quot;Whistleblower Initiatives.&quot;  These were meant to enforce a “zero tolerance policy for reprisal” against whistleblowers.  Specifically, they prevented employers from revoking a whistleblower's security clearance, placed a limit on DOE payment of litigation fees against whistleblowers, and established an &quot;employee concerns&quot; program to help ensure employee complaints would receive full attention from supervisors.&lt;ref name=&quot;senate&quot; /&gt;  While these reforms were well-intentioned, cases like Lappa's show that they have failed to reduce hostility towards whistleblowers.

On May 23rd, 2000, the Senate Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Committee on Commerce held a a congressional hearing on whistleblowing in DOE. During the hearing, Lappa's case was used as a prime example of the dysfunction of the Whistleblower Initiatives.  The Subcommittee concluded that the DOE has a clear conflict of interest by independently enforcing its zero tolerance policies and acting as a willing co-defendant against an internal  whistleblower.&lt;ref name=&quot;senate&quot; /&gt; The DOE consistently ignored its own policies and demonstrated that it is unable to self-regulate.

== Other Whistle-blowers at DOE==
[[File:US_Department_of_Energy_seal.png|thumb|right|border|Department of Energy Seal]]There have been many whistleblowers in DOE nuclear waste and energy labs. The security lapses identified by these whistleblowers often endanger public and national safety, but most of the informers still experience retaliation. Below are five recent examples of severe whistleblower retaliation at DOE.   

===== [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Levernier Richard Levernier] =====
''Nuclear Security Professional''
&lt;br /&gt;
Levernier reported weaknesses in DOE's plans to protect U.S. nuclear facilities after 9/11. DOE revoked his security clearance and demoted him to clerical work.

===== David Ridenour =====
''Director of Safeguards and Security at Rocky Flats Plant''
&lt;br /&gt;
Ridenour noticed that contractors were not handling secret information properly at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Flats_Plant Rocky Flats Plant], a nuclear weapons production facility.&lt;ref&gt;http://openjurist.org/397/f3d/925/ridenour-v-kaiser-hill-company-llc-a-eg-and-g-ct&lt;/ref&gt; His superiors harassed and intimidated him in an attempt to end his interference with the contractors. Ridenour later quit his job. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.aclu.org/national-security/national-security-whistleblowers&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Matt Zipoli =====
''Security Officer at Lawrence Livermore National Labs''
&lt;br /&gt;
Zipoli noticed a lack of protection for security officers at LLNL in the event of a terrorist attack. He also claimed that the training for security officers to help prevent such an attack was insufficient. He was fired. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fas.org/news/usa/2002/nuclearsafety/zipoli012302.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Ed McCallum =====
''Special Forces Colonel Employed at DOE''
&lt;br /&gt;
McCallum raised concerns to his superiors about security standards in nuclear waste environments. He was placed on administrative leave and investigated. &lt;ref name=&quot;mccallum&quot;&gt;http://alamo-girl.com/02722.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Mark Graf =====
''Program Manager of Alarm Station Operations at Rocky Flats''
&lt;br /&gt;
Graf reported that plutonium was stored in insecure locations and in rooms that were not up to code at Rocky Flats Plant. He was subsequently moved to the night shift and had his work load doubled. This prevented him from adequately performing his job, and he was eventually fired. &lt;ref name=&quot;graf&quot;&gt;http://www.fas.org/news/usa/2002/nuclearsafety/graf012302.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture at DOE==
The amount of retaliation against whistleblowers at DOE suggests that the Whistleblower Initiatives set in place in 1995 are simply band-aid fixes. Whistleblowers perform an important role in protecting public safety. The Initiatives need to be revised to foster a more supportive environment for these individuals. Many of the initiatives are reactive, because they provide support for the whistleblower only after the retaliation has occurred. This results in multi-year court cases which damage the image of DOE and ruin professional relationships.&lt;ref name=&quot;mccallum&quot; /&gt; Whistle-blowers need protection that will proactively eliminate retaliation. 

===== DOE Supporting Retaliation =====
In a Senate hearing in 2000, a lawyer for the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Accountability_Project Government Accountability Project], revealed that Rocky Flats Plant's law firm, Kaiser Hill, billed DOE for all fees associated with the Mark Graf court case. DOE also reimbursed all the expenses that the University of California's incurred from David Lappa's case.&lt;ref name=&quot;senate&quot;&gt;http://mspbwatch.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/whistleblowers-at-department-of-energy-facilities-is-there-really-zero-tolerance-for-contractor-retaliation-s-hrg-106-135.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture regulatory capture]. DOE is working to protect the interests of its contractors, not the public. By paying these litigation fees, DOE implicitly supports retaliation against whistleblowers.

===== Whistle-Blowers Who Were Right =====
Many of the whistleblowers's concerns, once investigated, are found to be serious threats to public safety. DOE eventually instituted new security measures in response to the complaints of both David Lappa and Mark Graf. Rocky Flats Plant  updated its policies to reflect many of Graf's complaints.&lt;ref name=&quot;graf&quot; /&gt; The DOE Investigator General examined Lappa's claims long after he reported them, and found that LLNL had violated DOE's Quality Assurance Rule.&lt;ref&gt;http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/04/f0/ea200012R01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; DOE forced LLNL to adjust their falling safety standards. These cases show that whistleblowers are valuable safeguards against [[Professionalism/Diane_Vaughan_and_the_normalization_of_deviance|normalization of deviance]], and that continuation of the hostile environment towards these individuals could lead to accidents.

==Generalizables==
We can use the case of David Lappa and other informers in the DOE to make general conclusions about whistleblowing.

===What is Whistleblowing?===
The term &quot;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower whistleblower]&quot; was coined by journalists in the case of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Otepka Otto Otepka], who reported misconduct in the State Department to the Senate in 1963. Otepka's case is no longer well-known, but the term stuck. It is often associated with politically-motivated informers, such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ellsberg Daniel Ellsberg] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden Edward Snowden], but whistleblowers like David Lappa are motivated by safety or public health concerns. The term itself simply means reporting illegal or immoral activity to a higher authority.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologyandsociety.org/__assets/__original/2013/04/4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes that authority is internal to an organization, and sometimes external, like a regulatory agency. Other similar terms include &quot;ethical resistor&quot;  or informer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glazer&quot;&gt;Glazer, Myron Peretz and Glazer, Penina Migdal. ''The Whistleblowers: Exposing Corruption in
Government and Industry.'' New York: Basic Books, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

In almost all cases, whistleblowing is a devisive act which leads to public scrutiny of the organization or individuals who were accused. The colleagues of the whistleblower feel betrayed, and often respond with personal retaliation against the individual. These cases are highly emotional and are frequently highlighted by the media. Movies such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Brockovich_(film) Erin Brokovich], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Whistleblower The Whistleblower], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Insider_(film) The Insider], and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silkwood Silkwood] portray how whistleblowers are threatened and intimidated by former colleagues and friends.

===The Components of a Whistleblowing Case===
Several common components are evident throughout whistleblowing cases, including those at the DOE. The first component is a work environment in which employees are conscious of wrongdoing in the organization, but refuse to report it. The illegal or immoral activity may be perpetrated by management, in which case employees are cowed into silence. Some employees may feel that it is not their responsibility to report the activity, or don't feel that their actions will make a difference. These are all examples of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect Bystander Effect].

Secondly, the informer feels that he or she has only two options: silence, or blowing the whistle. Two Australian lawyers identified this phenomenon in an article in the Journal of Business Ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Teo, H., &amp; Caspersz, D. (2011). Dissenting Discourse: Exploring Alternatives to the Whistleblowing/Silence Dichotomy. Journal of Business Ethics, 237-249. Retrieved from Journal of Business Ethics&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs when the organization provides no viable options to resolve the problem internally, or when management is hostile to complaints. In a 1989 study of American whistleblowers, social scientists Glazer and Glazer found that ethical resistors are often successful employees who believed strongly in the ideals of their organization. They feel shocked and betrayed when they find no internal avenues to resolve grievances or are told to ignore the issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glazer&quot; /&gt;

Finally, the whistleblower's former colleagues and friends retaliate.  This is a form groupthink, a term that Irving Janis coined in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Janis, I. (1972). ''Victims of groupthink : a psychological study of foreign-policy decisions and fiascoes.'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of groupthink include collective rationalization of assumptions, belief in the morality of the group, and pressure on dissenters. In response to the stressful situation following the accusation, members of the group draw closer together by rejecting the whistleblower. They defend the innocence of the group instead of working to discover if there is truth in the accusation.

In a 2010 study of nurse whistleblowers, one former informant was reported as saying “I keep my mouth shut these days. I’m a different person now… In hindsight I wouldn’t have said anything… it wasn’t worth it really, emotionally”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20626488&lt;/ref&gt; She reported an inappropriate sexual relationship between a doctor and a patient. Another study of whistleblowing retaliation in 1986 found that 17% of informants lost their homes, 15% divorced after the incident, and 10% attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Vinten, G. (1994). ''Whistleblowing : subversion or corporate citizenship?'' New York: St Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professionalism===
This analysis suggests an addition to the definition of professionalism. We contend that an important attribute of a professional is the ability to admit one's mistakes. In a whistleblowing case, this means rejecting groupthink, objectively reflecting on the morality of one's past actions, and being able to admit fault. It also means being able to forgive the person who made the accusation. Everyone, even professionals, will occasionally commit errors in judgement. It takes a great deal of courage and self knowledge to admit that error and to not shoot the messenger who publicly accused you of it. It is much harder for individuals to reject groupthink in an organization where management implicitly approves of retaliation, such as DOE. Reforming the Whistleblower Initiatives may encourage individual employees to act as professionals and end hostility towards whistleblowers.

Regarding your post on [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Technical Assistance]], I'd recommend reading [[Using Wikibooks/Wiki-Markup]].  In addition selecting ''Browse'' or ''Random book'' on the menu on the left of the screen and just investigating other books will help.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:06, 11 April 2014 (UTC)

== Importer Flag ==

I'm attempting to get rights to import content from English Wikipedia. If I should get the flag I would like some guidance on how to, because I'm unsure based on the page [[wikibooks:importers]]
:You'll see that I have changed it so that you now have importer rights.  [[Special:Import]] is the page to go to.  Make sure you select the correct project (''w'' for Wikipedia).  Then enter the correct title of the Wikipedia page.  Ensure the first check box is checked.  To transfer to a new page in your book choose ''(Main)'' from the drop-down box.  Enter your reasons for the import in the ''Comments'' field.  Finally enter ''Topology'' in the ''Destination root page'' field.  This will import the page from Wikipedia (let's call it ''Blob'') to Topology/Blob.  Sometimes there can be problems especially if it's a big page or a page with hundreds of revisions - in that case leave a message in the [[Wikibooks:Reading_room]] and someone will try to help.  Hope this all makes sense.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:36, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

Thank you! I'll try it out tonight. [[User:Knittedbees|Knittedbees]] ([[User talk:Knittedbees|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Knittedbees|contribs]]) 00:42, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
:I just noticed your first attempt.  It is possible to import directly to your book if you select ''Main'' from the drop-down box instead of ''Transwiki''.  I think the import didn't work because the actual page on Wikipedia is ''Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms'' with the long hyphen.  --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 01:04, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
:I have succeeded in importing that page now - [[Topology/Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms]].  I'll delete the other attempts.  I don't even have the long hyphen (–) on my keyboard (only the short (-) so I had to copy and paste from Wikipedia.  I should also add that imported pages will often be full of red links which you'll have to remove or change the links within the book.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 01:10, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
:I see you managed this time.  I had just imported it also so it looks strange when you click on ''History'' as there are now 3 different entries for each past edit because it has been imported 3 times - I don't think it matters.  I'll leave you to it and if you have any further problems hopefully someone will be around to help out - I'm off to bed.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 01:16, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
Great, thanks for setting me up, I'll just have to watch my punctuation. I can tell this will take some effort to get into wikibook style but still a lot easier than working from scratch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''normed vector space''' &lt;math&gt;(V,|\cdot|)&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space ''V'' with a function &lt;math&gt;|\cdot|:V\times V\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; that represents the length of a vector, called a norm. 

==Definition==

We know the vector space defintion, so we need to define the norm function. &lt;math&gt;|\cdot|&lt;/math&gt; is a norm if these three conditions hold.

1. Only the zero vector has zero length, with all others being positive. &lt;math&gt;|v|\geq 0, |v|=0\iff v=0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;v\in V&lt;/math&gt;.

2. For &lt;math&gt;a\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v\in V&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;|av|=|a||v|&lt;/math&gt;.

3. The triangle inequality holds: &lt;math&gt;|v+w|\leq |v|+|w|&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;v,w\in V&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example==

For a given &lt;math&gt;n\in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; we know that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space and its norm can be defined to be &lt;math&gt;|v-w|=d(v,w)&lt;/math&gt; ie. &lt;math&gt;|v|=d(v,0)&lt;/math&gt;. This is not unusual, in fact we say that a norm '''induces''' a metric with the first equation. So normed vector spaces are always metric spaces. Let's prove this.

==Theorem==

Normed vector spaces are metric spaces.

Proof

It suffices to show that &lt;math&gt;d(v,w)=|v-w|&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the metric axioms. Let &lt;math&gt;u,v,w\in V&lt;/math&gt;

1. &lt;math&gt;d(v,w)=|v-w|\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; holds by definition and &lt;math&gt;d(v,w)=|v-w|=0\iff v-w=0 \iff v=w&lt;/math&gt; as required.

2. &lt;math&gt;d(v,w)=|v-w|=|-1||w-v|=|w-v|=d(w,v)&lt;/math&gt;

3. &lt;math&gt;d(u,v)+d(v,w)=|u-v|+|v-w|\geq |u-v+v-w|=d(u,w)&lt;/math&gt; so the triangle inequality translates correctly.

Since the axioms hold, we conclude that ''V'' is a metric space.

== Book structure ==

Hello, books here are built as a main page with sub pages nested beneath them. You need to create them with names like [[Manga Study Guide: Barefoot Gen/Page 1]] and not as [[Page 1]]. I have deleted all the stubs that you created in the wrong place and amended your main page so new pages are created correctly. Please let me know if this isn't clear.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A fascinating aspect of Indian spirituality, specifically in the context of Hinduism, is its durability across hundreds and even thousands of years. As mentioned in the previous chapter, yoga as a practice seems to have been known in the Harappan civilization 5000 years ago. Similarly, the association of the triangle with feminine worship seems to have been present 11,000 years ago. This chapter will look at a few more examples of such nature.

== Sanskrit ==
Sanskrit is one of the more well known examples. Sanskrit is among the oldest languages of the Indo–European group of languages. Though no longer a widely spoken language, it is still extremely important as the classical language of Indian culture and the sacred language of Hinduism. Sanskrit, in its oldest known form entered North-West India during the second half of the second millennium BC, at which time it was similar in nature to its relative Avestan. Later, it spread into North India and came to be the preferred language of communication in cultural and religious aspects. The language evolved during the Vedic period until it was standardized by the grammarian Panini around the fourth century BC. Thereafter, his grammatical rules were generally followed with exactness, to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics |last=Brown |first=Keith |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1993|publisher=Elsevier|location= |isbn=978-0-08-044854-1 |page=9188 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Harappan civilization ==
A continuity between the Harappan civilization and several practices found in the region inpresent times has been proposed by some scholars. For example, the units of measurement for length and weight are said to be similar. A similarity of housing plans has also been shown between houses in Mohenjodaro and modern Gujarat. Similarities have also been found in construction techniques. Structural similarities, namely the ratio between the breadth and length of a structure have been shown between the building of the Harrapan civilization and the later Mauryan period. This ratio is also found in the sacrificial altars of vedic rites which are practiced in modern India. Parallels have also been drawn between Vedic Soma sacrifices and Harrapan fire altars.&lt;ref namə&quot;Danino&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Lost River |last=Danino |first=Michel|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books|location= |isbn=9780143068648 |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8yc7-OirxKEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=danino%20saraswati&amp;pg=PA196#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that a sculpture of a male, called the &quot;Priest King,&quot; found in Mohenjodaro may represent a yogi pose, with his eyes focused on the tip of his nose, half closed in concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Handbook of Ancient Religions |last=Hinnells|first=|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location= |isbn=9781139461986|page=450 |pages= |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FIYiil96ZXAC&amp;lpg=PA450&amp;dq=priest%20king%20yogi&amp;pg=PA450#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historicity of festivals ==
=== Navratri and Dussehra ===
There is evidence that the slaying of the buffalo demon by the goddess Durga was present as early as 1st Century BC. However, the DUrga cult could possibly date further back into prehistoric times. Towards the end of the Gupta period in North India and the Chola period in South India, the worship of Durga took the form of a ten-day festival associated with war. Besides martial rites, fertility rites and kingship rites associated with wealth were also present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mysore Royal Dasara |last=Sivapriyanand|first=Swami|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1995 |publisher=Abhinav Publications|location= |isbn=9781139461986 |pages= |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=DVkyFvZL_qMC&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=history%20of%20navaratri&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the present day, these three factors are still found, represented as Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati, each allocated three of the nine days of Navratri, with the tenth day being Vijayadashami or the day of victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.ishafoundation.org/lifestyle/dussehra-vijayadashami/ |title=Dussehra or Vijayadashami – Why Do We Celebrate It? |author= |date=14 October 2013 |work= |publisher=Isha Blog |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
When administrator starts working by himself with Autodesk Vault, he runs into quite unusual client-server logic. For programmers it's even more hard to understand how API really works. Autodesk, no offense.
&lt;br /&gt;
But after a little time later all becomes much clear and easy. Remembering those days, I tried to comprehend Vault, at now I'd like to make easy way for others to start working with Vault.
&lt;br /&gt;
I beg your pardon, but I'll be using PowerShell language mainly, for some reasons:
# This is .Net language, so code could be easy translated to any other .NET language: C#, C++ VB.NET, JScript .NET, etc., or even one code could be embedded to other.
# The code is extremely short - you can get very illustrative wonderful program in just several lines of code.
# PS is interpreted language, you just store it in text and can easy change to create fork.
# PS is command line language and you can build object conveyors - this benefits could be useful in administration.
All code available on [https://github.com/miwaniza/Autodesk_Vault_Programmers_Cookbook.git GitHub].
So, let's start! Approximate TOC you can see below. Links to articles will be continuously updated.

A '''vector space''' &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is formed by scalar multiples of vectors. The scalars are most commonly real numbers but can also be complex, or from any field.

==Definition==

A vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; on a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; with two binary operations, commonly vector addition on elements of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and scalar multiplication, by elements of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, of elements of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. These operations are subject to 8 axioms ('''u''','''v''', and '''w''' are vectors &lt;math&gt;\in V&lt;/math&gt; and a and b are scalars &lt;math&gt;\in F&lt;/math&gt;):

1. Associativity (addition): ('''u'''+'''v''')+'''w''' = '''u'''+('''v'''+'''w''').

2. Associativity (scalar and field multiplication): a(b'''u''') = (ab)'''u'''

3. Distributivity (field addition): (a+b)'''u''' = a'''u'''+b'''u'''

4. Distributivity (vector addition): a('''u'''+'''v''') = a'''u'''+a'''v'''

5. Identity element (addition): &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; '''0''' &lt;math&gt;\in V&lt;/math&gt; such that '''u'''+'''0''' = '''u''' &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; '''u''' &lt;math&gt;\in V&lt;/math&gt;

6. Identity element (scalar multiplication): 1'''u''' = '''u'''

7. Commutativity: '''u'''+'''v''' = '''v'''+'''u'''

8. Inverse element: &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; -'''u''' &lt;math&gt;\in V&lt;/math&gt; such that '''u'''+(-'''u''') = '''0''' &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; '''u''' &lt;math&gt;\in V&lt;/math&gt;

A simplicial complex is a union of spaces known as simplicies, that are convex hulls of points in general position. In Euclidean space they can be thought of as a generalisation of the triangle. For the first few dimensions they are: the point, the line segment, the triangle and the tetrahedron.

==Definition of a simplex==

Given n+1 points &lt;math&gt;\{a_0,a_1,\dots,a_n\}&lt;/math&gt;, in a space with dimension of at least n, such that no three points are colinear, the set

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}=\{t_0a_0+t_1a_1+\dots+t_na_n:\sum_{i=1}^n t_i = 1\text{ with }t_i\in [0,1]\}&lt;/math&gt;

is a simplex, and more specifically an n-simplex since it has n+1 verticies.

==The standard n-simplex==

For ease we will sometimes need a standardised co-ordinate system for a simplex. The standard n-simplex, a subset of Euclidean (n+1)-space, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, is

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_n=\{(t_0,t_1,\dots,t_n)\in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}: t_i\geq 0\text{ and }\sum^n_{i=0} t_i=1\}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the set is expressed in a very similar manner, but the co-ordinates are fixed in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:2D-simplex.svg|150px|thumb|right|A diagram of the standard n-simplex in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, with n=2]]

==Face of a Simplex==

A face of an n-simplex &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is any (n-1)-simplex formed by an n-1 element subset of the verticies of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Defintion of a simplicial complex==

A simplicial complex is a union of simplicies such that the intersection of any two simplicies is a simplex. Alternatively if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a simplicial complex then

1. Every face of a simplex in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a simplex in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

2. The intersection of two simplicies &lt;math&gt;A, B \in \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a face of both of A and B.

==Example==

The triangulation of a polygon in the plane is a simplcial complex. In fact it hints at the existance of simplicial complexes existing for all polytopes, e.g. every polyhedron can be expressed as tetrahedrons meeting full face to full face.

==Exercises==

In general, a ''morphism'' refers to a function mapping from one space to another that preserves structure. In terms of vector spaces the natural morphism is a ''linear map''.

==Linear maps==
{{TextBox|1=
;Definition of Linear Map:
A ''linear map'' is a function &lt;math&gt;f:V\to W&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V, W&lt;/math&gt; are vector spaces over a field F. Such that for all &lt;math&gt;v,w\in V&lt;/math&gt;

1. &lt;math&gt;f(v+w)=f(v)+f(w)&lt;/math&gt;

2. &lt;math&gt;f(\alpha v)=\alpha f(v)&lt;/math&gt;

}}

The image of a linear map is a subspace of the domain. The kernel of a linear map is a subspace of the codomain.

==The Importance of Kernels and Images==

{{TextBox|1=
;Definition of Rank:
The ''rank'' of a linear map is the dimension of the image of the map &lt;math&gt;dim(Im(f))&lt;/math&gt;. It also can be found using row reduction on the corresponding matrix.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Definition of Nullity:
The ''nullity'' of a linear map, or matrix, is the dimension of the kernel of the map &lt;math&gt;dim(Ker(f))&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;The Rank-Nullity Theorem:
For any linear map &lt;math&gt;f:V\to W&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dim(Ker(f))+dim(Im(f))=dim(V)&lt;/math&gt;
}}

GENERAL COMMENTS																				* GEN00.0	Consistant with the philosophy of &quot;If-we-break-it, it's-our-job-to-really-fix-it&quot; patches to update all CM's from TS2006-SP0 should be issued for all EXE or DLL re-issue fixable mode suggested hereinafter. 
* This is a moral obligation heretofore overlooked and ignored by N3V. People that are comfortable with a Trainz release should not have to suffer from a bad change inserted by coding changes or N3V's practices and data models. Realizing they are desiring to sell newer versions, breaking older status-quo ante behaviour is never ethical. You want sales, provide added value, not broken historic behavior.
** A prime example of this is CMP's original formulation to NOT report trainz-build tag values, as later CM's have and the concurrent BUG overlooked in each since, that of mishandling &quot;Update available&quot; by not discriminating with respect to Trainz-build tag values. This is a bona-fide BUG and N3V has a moral obligation to fix it.
** Similarly, KUID and KUID2 handling is mismanaged. Internally all the CMs ought be treating KUIDS as KUID2:xxx:yyy:0 as they indeed are evaluated. In practice, in operating CM, the two forms are not equal in searching, to the discomfiture of the customers. This means things are confusing, missed, overlooked and vexing. Having to 'Show Versions' to see alternative KUIDs is plainly deliterious to efficient user time investment and so forth. Searching &lt;kuid:xxx:yyy&gt; should expand to include all the &lt;KUID2:xxx:yyy:nn&gt; forms in the list resulting. Then OBSOLETE icons have context, the user can eliminate such. 
** Related is the mishandling of the reports of updated kuids. MISSING DEPENDENCIES should not be showing obsoleted versions as a Missing dependency. THey aren't necessary so must not be shown as missing for it devalues the validity and utility of searching dependencies status icon (The yellow puzzle piece) ineffect trashing the users local database with FALSE and unhelpful information.

* GEN01.0 	Programmers totally insensitive to aging problems. In particular eyesight. 
																		
* GEN01.a 	Ability to change skin and text color away from default is highly needed. 
																		
* GEN01.b	An ability to modify skin+font size+font color+font face in CM, and font stuff in Surveyor would be REALLY REALLY valuable upgrade for us older and the visually impaired. Monitor+vid card configurations, dependent settings and such vary so much customer to customer that NOT having the flexibility means we tens-of-thousands're forced to make do with proofed displays vetted by the unaged and less debilitated.
																		
* GEN01.c 	Particularly bad is the font size and coloration in TS12 Surveyor, especially SESSION EDIT WINDOW and the Mini Map gradiants' TS12 change from previous green to white font. (The latter clutters the screen with illegibility when labels are also on.
																		
* GEN01.d 	Another color for trackside versus Scenery/Industry labels would be a nice option as well. Each of these should be customer settable for his own situation. 'Restore to Default' and Save Themes highly suggested accompanying changes... don't want disappearing print after all if someone misapplies an option.
																										
* GEN02.0 	Particularly bad is Session rules color schema. Black on current colors would be fine. Some idiot put white lettering on mostly grey backgrounds making text 'LOW CONTRAST' all-but-illegible with accompanied by the other stupid change... reducing the font sizes to ANT PRINT. 
																		
* GEN02.a	RESTORE TRS2006 LOOK SEE AND FEEL. 
																		
* GEN02.b	Trash any ant print in the programs. 
																		
* GEN02.c	DEFAULT Min 'printers font size' (1 pt = 1/72nd inch) should be 10pt to 12pr for your actual user base AFTER monitor scaling. If the tools menu grows to take up the whole left margin, so be it. Straining to see/read something necessary is very frustrating and counter-productive and very deliterious to an enjoyable experience. 
																		
* GEN02.d	Kids eyes can read large text fine, post 45 year-old eyes have adjustment issues young programmers need to be sensitive too. With a customization ability, the kids can select a smaller font at need.
																		
* GEN02.e	Regardless of settings, search window 'current line' should wrap to show whole titles of 'Username' data field. 
																													
* GEN03. 	Surveyor and Driver MAPS had nice legible green GRADIENT DATA... White in TS12 makes them blend into other data types messing with peoples' time who are trying to smooth terrain and appearance. 
																													
* GEN04. 	Loose a lot of time because Screen zooms or begins to zoom to medium elevation pseudo-flying-looking-down mode. THAT FOCAL TRIGGER ca 500-1000m too soon. Raise at least 300 meters. Current switch point is just about where one wants to tour a panarama of fixed layout.
																													
* GEN05. 	Back in TRS2006... Elimination of TYPE and REGION tags manifesting in Surveyor tools was counterproductive. Breaking selectable sub-groups is opposite to the needs of users trying to remember how to find an single asset name to plop down. Pick list doesn't cut it with Category-Class filtering alone -- Dataset should allow user understanding to subcategorize such groupings. WHAT IS NEEDED is ability to allow USERS to override AUTHORS and edit those tags in both Surveyor, viewer and pick APPS and at the very least from CM--without a need to manually open config.txt and edit... CM should allow various adjustments in other words using popup APIs while maintaining CURRENT SEARCH.

* GEN06.  History of Current Search and last selections too short in real life error fixing. Consider some specific search which then shows assets with missing dependancies. Now need to change screen to  display for  assets to see the missing asssets  (second screen)  so can evaluate versions and/or reported errors and warnings and so forth. Any one asset examination may lead to another search, so third is used. Resolving that, usually means importing or DLS machinations... usually involving a fourth screen. The ORIGINAL TASK you were about is now almost always gone... so if you didn't manually save that search you are screwed again by the programmers doing coding on the cheap and convenient for  them, not software crafted to the users common needs.
																													
* GEN07. 	KUID2 version assets should not generate a missing dependancy puzzle piece when the prior assets are not present. If five failed and the sixth trial works, ':5' version is all that matters INCLUDING WHENEVER something else is referencing an earlier version. (Logically, the CM data base may want to track the substitute, but CM should not be written  to bother humans about an earlier missing version, unless parts of it are needed by reference. In that case, Trainz should create a whole corrected asset and kill the earlier versions itself. 
																						
* GEN08. 	BADLY need data search range and especially a date range abilty in CM, we humans work in spurts, recall by association, and frequently work past one days end (MIDNIGHT... during scarce and valuable 'HOBBY TIME') and the beginning of the next... or over several groups of days, our highly constrained time permitting. Selecting individual days with ANDs is tedious to say the least, and worst, cannot be saved. (the dates aren't saved but normalise to 'today'.) 

* GEN08b.	Allow dates in search pane as saved criteria in CM, and it's seatrch tabs

* GEN08c. 	Some wildcarding in search parameters would be greatly appreciated. Especially at least a two field search with wilddards in between. Tektronics or possibly DEC once had a beautiful command line search which would be good. '/tag1/*/tag2/' was better than a regex for finding variable length terms. Some regex could be built in as well. '//Ctag1Ctag2C*' (or '//Ctag1CC*tag2C' as an alternive to the first example) would enable the delimiter to subst so that character would be the new escaped delimiter... what ever the character might be. 

* GEN08d-1. 	DOUBLE escape after a space following a valid find string would have the last part be a substitution string. THAT required a second escape character which was usually the '$' IIRC. Thus '/tag1/*/$tag2$/ /$replacement$/' would replace 'tag2' and similarly, '/tag1/*/$*$//tag2/ /$insert_this$/ would split and insert the term. Also used were # for a digit, ? for a single char and '^nn' to repeat a type so ?^15 would count fifteen anycharacters, whilst #^(2-7) allowed for variable number digit sequences, which would include both decimal points, scientific notation (-1.5408E-04) and signs if necessary in such. 

* GEN08d2.	Given such tooling, would like to have RENAMING on the fly inside CM, even Surveyor... some way to locally change the term string of an asset (username). Could be implemented as an alias term CM inserts into the config.

* GEN09. 	Along similar lines, adding a revisions and notes tag in the config would be very welcome the revisions field would display as an header prefixing the asset description data and the notes as an addendum suffixing the asset description data. 

* GEN10.	Those three and the trainz-build codes need be viewable in an auxillary window in surveyor... Said content display window would change when the selected item is accessed in the surveyor tools tabs. The user would toggle it open and closed with a hotkey toggle and/or close button.
																		
* GEN09.a	Need to self-identify which asset is list of errors and warnings in titlebars
																		
* GEN09.b 	IMPORT .cdp and Content... 'TASK COMPLETED' 'DETAILS' messages should pair both asset names and kuids (ALWAYS ACTUALLY) This was unhelpful results:
Message: Will install content package &quot;F:\CDP files\All_TS12_CDPs\Scenery Trainz.cdp&quot;
Message: Will install content package &quot;F:\CDP files\All_TS12_CDPs\TransDEM Ground Textures V3.cdp&quot;
Message: Will install content package &quot;F:\CDP files\All_TS12_CDPs\US&amp;S Style B Semaphore Pack.cdp&quot;

... 

* GEN09c) Would actually be quite handy to have these screens have a kuid stream output, a comma separated list of the kuids listed in the message. Something we can paste in (including unknown location Kuids) into the search window or capture to a text file to later pursue missing assets. As is, we have to go through several other screens to capture dependencies which are unknown location (missing, not on DLS nor local).
																		
09d)	Several different output arrangements by click box selection would be nice
																		
09e) 	[CTRL]-[A] + [CTRL]-[C} needs to work on all these message boxs and APIs. Default should then list both kuids and names with messages. Excepting error and warnings report... which should have those indentifiers in the tit6le bar... solutions sometimes take a while to research... other things demand attention, so having pairing with folders open for edit and a results window... is far more efficient than guessing!
																		
10. 	Programmers need to use unique names for executables Windows finds out about. The overuse of Trainz.exe (one in bin one as launcher from installation's root) is confusing at best. Worse still is no distinction between versions in name for those who operate multiple Trainz legacy varieties too. Poor practice in any event given stand-alone nature of evolving product.	

* GEN11.0	Task complete message windows, and all popup windows in general: assaying extent of errors frequently has 3-5 open at once to see where same error by same author is occuring. Need to self-identify which asset is list of errors and warnings in titlebars. Further, if possible a different icon in Windows 'open processes' (Taskbars tabs) would be valuable, at LEAST one different from CM and another different for TADdaemon (if visible).


Main Menu wishlist
01a. 	Author column of Routes and Sessions
																		
01b.	Title bar show folder pathspec and trainz-build 
																													
02a.	Columns listing Last ALTERED date and last access date
																		
02b.	and kuids (All optional toggle or click box or drop down selectable)
																													
03. 	MAIN MENU -- RESUME historic behavior of positioning list menu to last loaded route and session,	or at least display what it was. (Prefer the TS2009-TRS2004 historic menu overall)
																													
04. 	MAIN MENU -- 'Navigation Action buttons' at or near top (Like browsers), not down at screen bottom nor any at right and left... launch interface frankly sucks.
																													
COM05.0 CM+SUR -- Desire Two run-time EDITABLE USER 'AUX-DESCRIPTIONs fields' that individual users can add and edit in both CM and Surveyor, adding that capability to viewer mode asset browsers like Railyard and  the proposed 'Trackside&quot; (or what ever name is given the general asset viewer(s). These should be click-box activated or disabled to see only the description (default) or any combo of the three.

COM05.a New Tag &quot;Aux-description1&quot; would prefix in CM and any in surveyor pop-up description view (Suggested else where in detail). 

COM05.b Whilst tag &quot;Aux-description2&quot; or &quot;Revisions-record&quot; would append to current string when things display, if enabled. (I'd use this to display a change record, of modified assets. (e.g. Date, installed newer data structures and thumbnails, deleted obsolescent tags 'region', 'type' 'asset-filename', [Or whatever] and advanced Kuid to Kuid2 and trainz-build to V2.6 ,[Or whatever]. This latter could and should be handled in a remarks header block as a file header ID.																			
																				
06.  Ability to search keywords or string in both CM and Surveyor DESCRIPTION FIELDS... including proposed 'Aux-description' augmentations. [Like all good coding, where necessary legacy Trainz releases should have a Patch to ignore such new data and data formats. The same patch project should be used to fix the various CMs so that they all (TRS2006, TC1&amp;2, TC3...) ignore versions currently listed as AVAILABLE UPDATES when in fact those are in data formats incompatible with earlier Trainz. (i.e. BUG IN CM programming: Assets to build v3.7 should NOT be reported as available in TS10 etc. Assets to 3.0  should not be reported as Out of Date in TC3, and its predecessors.)

SURVEYOR NEEDS and shortcomings...
* SUR01.	NEW TOOL BUTTON==Need ability to set numeric height and rotation on F3-O scenery objects; sometimes things manifest with slight offset angle that cannot be eliminated, ditto elevation differential making it impossible to blend two or more into one displayed entity/virtual object.

* SUR02.	NEW TOOL BUTTON==Need ability to set a fixed (default) angle of F3-O scenery items in put down. (e.g. all the houses in a row development parrallel to a street oriented at compass 323 or 45 or 165 degrees...) THis means the auto-rotation setting in OPTIONS needs local override toggle and data input. USE THE SPACE wasted currently by &quot;Advanced Tools&quot; (WHAT A CROCK OF...) expanders... 

* SUR03.	Pick list needs to respond to tool activated so only F3 items are in when tool active, so only F4-Y objects (trackside) show when that tool selected, etc.

* SUR04.	Need to be able to save and import nn+1 pick list(s) -- users names and options (...\Settings\picks\*.txt suggested)

* SUR05.	Get tools inconsistent -- all should stay in get mode until A for Add hotkey pressed.
 
* SUR06. 	TEXTURE TOOL needs overhauled so selected texture name/title of texture appears in edit line.

* SUR07.	Elevation back away 'zoom to map mode' needs switching-point trigger capability to be set by user or raised at least 1000 feet above current trigger point, and THAT VALUE should be the default for user set point when fixed. [High priority--this is costing lots of lost time in undesired focal shifts.]

* SUR08. 	BADLY NEED hot key for 'View errors and warnings'.

* SUR09. 	Changing of perspective by slight zoom back to see wider panorama/view is very annoying -- 3x out of four imposes a long delay... [suspect presumably because of LOD meshes???] 
																		
* SUR10. 	Would like a hotkey to set angle of view relative to horizon when viewing obliquely downwards and 'flying' above terrain. Mounse rolls too far, too frequently stopping on either side of best angle as wanted.

* SUR11.a  Eliminating Objects subgrouping type control in surveyor a bad mistake. Industries vs buildings etc. had a filtering and location ability that was very useful. Far more useful than huge list format now in TS12.

* SUR11.b	New Feature very much desired: HOTKEY ability to toggle widening of tool menu displays so can read the whole title of items.

* SUR12. 	Wanted: Global GET TOOL - Press hotkey then clickon whatever, gives the proper tool tab, then KUID under mouse tool tip.

* SUR13. 	If tab is active, any get key should open tab and display the get... not waste users time.

* SUR14. 	Railyard spinoff-allow viewing of F3-O objects and preferrably also F3-S, F4-Y, F2 textures, ideally in popup from in CM like viewing the config.txt file.

* SUR15. 	TOOL API's and Pick List, etc... popup items using up screen space including mini-map should be dragable to second or third head monitors AND ALSO RESIZABLE! 

* SUR16. 	CLICK BUTTON IN SURVEYOR AND CM to 'UNFAVORITE' an asset... i.e. NEVER SHOW ME THIS ITEM AGAIN in Surveyor (e.g. Flip Trees in a Speedtreed route, BR rollng stock in US etc.) Whether this is same as disabling the item in CM or archiving it, or some third mode, don't care. Disabling seems about right, but in CM would LOVE TO HIDE THOSE THINGS TOO! 

* SUR17. 	WANT A 'PICK LIST OF (adjustment) TOOL BUTTONS' w/data seeting input fields, perhaps on F8? 
																		
* SUR18. 	GET TOOLS MUST STOP DEFAULTING to ADD. I can hit the 'A' hotkey myself.
																		
* SUR19. 	Surveyor ability to toggle sounds on and off whilst working an area would be nice. Got a wolf right where I need to do a lot more development ... that really annoys the wife and me!

* SUR20. 	Compass rose added in the Trainz Classics in the exactly worst place on the minimap for those of us using one monitor more often than not. THAT MODE requires a small mini map extended off the screen lower left corner... making the compass rose overtop some very valuable views... near center screen, where the mouse moves the screen/angle and keys rotate the view.

* SUR21. 	'Circumstansial Selectable Pick groups' ... Seperate Pick List both by type and some user definable groups activated by 'click buttons'... trying to just pick textures they are mixed with other things really slowing down the utility of Pick list. IF &quot;Bookmarks buttons&quot; had a second row coresponding to other pick lists, all savable and transportable route to route, etc. (Export should be an external and EDITABLE comma delimited multiline TXT file enabling users to copy, edit, or archive! 'Input' and 'save as' and 'merge with' file at some path specified too. Extracting a portion ('Export Part As...' and saving as would be nice but not necessary feature.)

* SUR22. 	LIST ABILITY of Asset type X &quot;In this Route&quot;... for example... list all textures on ground used so far on this route and put them in a pick list type display applett.

* SUR23. 	Asset choosing tools should allow description in Surveyor mode in an optional pop-up screen. Popup concieved to be an extension of current tool set and applies solely to selected asset. Scrolling through those scrolls the descritions in the new popup enhanced. 

content manager punchlist 
																			* CMn0.0	[partial repeat-see whole in General comments] Consistant with the philosophy of &quot;If-we-break-it, it's-our-job-to-really-fix-it&quot; patches to update all CM's from TS2006-SP0 should be issued for all EXE or DLL re-issue fixable mode suggested hereinafter. A prime example of this is CMP's original formulation to NOT report trainz-build tag values, as later CM's have and the concurrent BUG overlooked in each since, that of mishandling &quot;Update available&quot; by not discriminating with respect to Trainz-build tag values.
																					
* CMn01.	Errors are so prevalent, need View Errors and Warnings API in title bar to give title of asset being reported. In the real world, we have no choice but to chase more than one error at a time now and then. [Very High Priority]

* CMn02. 	&lt;kuid:-10:197&gt; 

* CMn03. 	CM BADLY NEEDS WEB type interface so pervasive nowadays to backspace to previous search, and such searches as are kept in que, needs much longer length. Four just isn't enough and eight might not be either. 16 would be more than enough in any circumstance I could keep straight. Bumping off listed items in searches list would be a good feature to have, suggest drag and toss feature. 

* CMn04. 	DUP 14 above: Railyard spinoff-allow viewing of F3-O objects and preferrably also F3-S, F4-Y, F2 textures, ideally in popup from in CM like viewing the config.txt file.

* CMn05. 	Ability to save download que, set it aside and prioritize a different DLS list first. reboot Trainz or computer or in any event return to it or any other saved list at a later time more convenient to the user.

* CMn06. 	Listing ability of stuff in Download helper

* CMn07. 	Expand codes for category region to indlude continental expanses, e.g. Mexico, US+ Canada find much in the way of identical rolling stock types.

* CMn08. 	Capture current search/main list to savable kuid list (Text file will do fine, best if search then allowe import of same. Manual cut and paste fine too for me.)

* CMn09. 	Asset Description to be 1st item, then screenshot in ASSET DETAILS pane
* CMn10. 	CLICK BOX on SEARCH PANE to disable including DLS and Local and Built In items selectively. Setting three criteria (Name_+AND NOT+ON DOWNLOAD STN is time disrespectful. NEED TOO OFTEN.

* CMn11. 	Boolean search params... move to top of list, or preferably loose and replace with click-box implementation where the clickbox applies to the next search field following. Rearranging search to a top bar would be advisable--the left panes are overly busy and overworked.

* CMn12. 	Along the same lines revising the 'Asset Details' pane to a relocatable resizable window format [or this older (option selectable) placement] would be good. Description and screenshot are most important, so current placement as bottom items is contraindicated. 

* CMn13. 	Finding a list of KUIDs comes up as obsoletes, when should default to showing current kuid installed and active if that's suplanting it. CHANGE THE FONT COLOR AT LEAST SHOWING the little OBSOLETE iconography means the asset is coming up obsolete when it's the only version still to be found. (May be a circumstance with new kuid obsoleting an updated one. Seen in SS Log Dump Diesel, misstated: &lt;kuid2:86661:144048:2&gt; (replacement) vs. &lt;kuid:86661:144012&gt;, the first has the 2nd in obsolete table. BOTH were in data base. Having the disposihle one come up in red font would let people know is deletable asset. Generated errors in newer Trainz apparently. Part of Northbay County routes. 
) 

* CMn14.0 	Need a right Click Copy KUIDS ONLY for CM Main Display items. Sometimes want just a comma separated list, for example to search another Trainz's CM for said assets.

* CMn15.0 	CURRENT SEARCH 'Tab' should return user to the prior search selected by the main search tool in the left CM/CMP Pane -- not OVERRIGHT THAT with the results of clicking &quot;VIEW IN MAIN LIST&quot;, or any of it's derived subsequent Show Dependencies applets. 

* CMn15.a 	THIS IS AN URGENT CHANGE NEED that would greatly aid user productivity and experiences with Trainz--downloading many assets, especially routes and sessions, often returns a large &quot;PUNCH LIST&quot; of further items that need to be downloaded. 

* CMn15.b 	The ONLY way to currently capture and enter these into the Download Helper pane is to SHOW IN MAIN LIST... then drag and drop -- messing up a larger work process and interfering with ongoing project tasks (INTERUPTIONS SUCK). VERY VEXING.
																		
* CMn15.c Recommend:	Adding clidk box &quot;ADD Updates and missing dependencies to the Show Dependencies applet. One click adds any updated or missing dependency available on the DLS to the CM DOWNLOAD HELPER PANE. 
																		
* CMn15.d Further, missing dependencies NOT ON THE DLS ought to append a log file as follows:
** ''Timestamp, Datestamp, TRAINZ ASSET: 
:::  'JRPX 20800 gal tank car', &lt;kuid2:45324:300008:2&gt;  missing the following non-DLS assets:
:::  Unknown Location: &lt;kuid2:45324:28900:1&gt;
:::  Unknown Location: &lt;kuid2:45324:50203:1&gt;
:::  Unknown Location: &lt;kuid2:45324:555200:1&gt;
:::: &lt;kuid2:45324:300008:2&gt; needs: &lt;kuid2:45324:28900:1&gt;,&lt;kuid2:45324:50203:1&gt;,&lt;kuid2:45324:555200:1&gt;

:: END: 'JRPX 20800 gal tank car' 
																		
* CMn16.0 	HOTKEY and/or menubar toggle between Large and Small Icons.
	- Really need a Medium size, small icons can't be made out, but that's best for maximizing data listed seen. LARGE for figuring out the status. A blend of the two would be greatly appreciated. Hence a rotating toggle would work.
 
																		
* CMn17.0	CMs occasionally get display all bolloxed up, so Settings click box to reinitialize display (as when starting up) would cut down on the quitting our and relaunching (and reduce frustration because of interupted thought process, work in prograss.)
																		
* CMn18.0	IMPORTING CDPs... The Task COmplete popup needs the STANDARD show in 'Main View' option button even for case when ALL ASSETS SKIPPED because already present. And the default behavior should be to show all in the CDP when so viewing a mixed bag of imports and skipped. AT THE LEAST this would help us better organize and label collected CDPs without resorting to pasting the names in and then one by one searching what the heck was there and came in (or was present in the cdp). 
 
																		
* CMn19.0	CDP Preview read and display needed, not a base import, but data to decide if import is GOOD... Kuids list, Names, Trainz-build at a mininum. Option to VIEW in MAIN SCREEN and if there, check the lot for updates on the DLS (Versions listed for each, in other words)
																		
* CMn20.0	Importing CDPs or otherwise, View in Main List needs to display the UNKNOWN KUIDs in the same list so we can at least get the picture of how much we're screwed by downloading that route or session... If CM could manage a running list of missing assets we can get as a text report file, that would be a great time saving feature.
																		
* CMn21.0	Selecting a batch (Screenful) of assets and lauching view Versions, needs allow a cut and paste save at least for missing (ny definintion UNKNOWN to the DLS) assets.
																		
* CMn22.0	Task Complete popups universally need report which version in reporting CM output results, with TADdaemon running 3 CMs at once and cross loading assets has been a frequent experience this past week.
																		
* CMn23.0	Having the registry entry for CPS track various installations and ask which Trainz to launch/load them into would be a nice safeguard. An accidental click had TRS2006 importing TS09--TS12 data yesterday... 
																		
* CMn24.0	INSTALL A THUMNAIL AUTOMATICALLY feature. A) adapt Railyard to show any asset. The software ia already present in surveyor ot generate the rotating images... adapt so 
** CMn24.a	Scenery ([f3]-[O] selections and many [f4]-[Y] assets can be viewed in a standard Trainz board with some default setups of terrain based on size of the asset generated geometry (tiny, small, medium, large corresponding to a road sign/trackside small footprint asset, house size, commercial building size, Factory/Level Bridges assets with ample lengths). Each of those can be placed in a locus a fixed radial distance from the (focal length) virtual camera, the object virtually rotated to maximize width aspect, and if rectangular camera position automatically precessed around (i.e. to show two building faces) and canted (move camera up to tree top height) to establish a perspective view. SNAP SNAP. AUTO EDIT the configs.
	
* CMn25.0	Task complete message windows, and all popup windows in general: assaying extent of errors frequently has 3-5 open at once to see where same error by same author is occuring. Need to self-identify which asset is list of errors and warnings in titlebars. Further, if possible a different icon in Windows 'open processes' (Taskbars tabs) would be valuable, at LEAST one different from CM and another different for TADdaemon (if visible).

* CMn26.0 	Ordering of items in Search drop down needs refactored to place those needed most often up the top, AND and OR, NAME, AUTHOR, KUID, immediately come to mind as do local, DLS and installed. Category should be just after booleans.

* CMn27.0 	Displaying a list of assets in such and such should not loose the current search. Further, especially should have search combo's in search pane listed over list of kuids. Even going one page past, measn guessing on what resulted 3-30 minutes ago. Mostly I miss finding my way back. More history would be best, preferrably like a Broswer history of at least 16 items in drop down form, most recent top to bottom. Date installed, Date modified, era, region at bottom. Alternatively this order and alphabetical with click box toggle.

DRIVER SHORTCOMINGS
* DVR01.	Font size on Driver Map is about 2 pt too small for older viewers. Desire a menu option to select larger sizes from this default as the new minimum of a set of selectable font scales.
* DVR02. 	Repeat above for default font size in HTML pop-up Windows

* DVR03. 	TS12 switch to white on other white lettering Gradients data is HIGHLY problematic. GIVE US GREEN AGAIN Please. Having another text color for some frequent assets would also be handy-suggest yellow for junction names and a seperate toggle to hide those labels or the Red-Green controls which can overwhelm accessing the data one actually needs when trying to get an overview of upcoming tracks and yards. Need to process junctions follows after getting a sense of what is needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Cantor space is a generalisation of the Cantor set, which can be seen as any element as the homeomorphism class of the Cantor set defined below.

==Definition of the Cantor set==

The Cantor set is the limit of an infinite process of removing subsets of the unit interval depicted here.
[[Image:Cantor set in seven iterations.svg|729px|Cantor ternary set, in seven iterations]]

So at any given step we remove the middle thirds of the unit interval, let &lt;math&gt;C_0=[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; so at the n-th step we have:

:&lt;math&gt;C_n=\frac{C_{n-1}}{3}\cup \big(\frac{2}{3}+\frac{C_{n-1}}{3}\big)&lt;/math&gt;

So the effect is scaling the previous step down by a third and putting two copies next to each other. Then the Cantor set is

:&lt;math&gt;C=\bigcap_{i=0}^{\infty} C_i&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition of the Cantor space==

A Cantor space is any space homeomorphically equivalent to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; defined above. The value of this defintion is elucidated by the following theorem.

==Brouwer's Theorem==

An equivalent form of Brouwer's original theorem is: &quot;A topological space is a Cantor space if and only if it is non-empty, perfect, compact, totally disconnected, and metrizable.&quot; 

To understand this let's fill in the definition not yet covered. 

1. Clearly, non-empty means it is not the empty set. 

2. Perfect means the space has no isolated points (no points that are contained in an open set in the ambient space).

3. Compactness has been covered.

4. Totally disconnected means the connected components (the maximal connected subsets) of the space are all points.

5. Metrisable means there exists a metric for this space.

Thus the theorem states that the combination of these conditions leaves a space homeomorphic to the Cantor set.

==Example==

Consider the map from the set of infinite binary codes &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; often written &lt;math&gt;2^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; to the Cantor set defined above: &lt;math&gt;f:2^\mathbb{N}\to C&lt;/math&gt; defined as for a sequence &lt;math&gt;a=(a_i)_{i=0}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(a)=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\frac{2a_i}{3^{i+1}}&lt;/math&gt;

Then f is a homeomorphism of metric spaces, meaning that all the properties above hold for the space &lt;math&gt;2^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.</text>

=Becker's Defence=
The idea of Becker's Defence 3...h6 is to play 4...g5 without having to fear 5.h4, which would simply be answered with 5...Bg7.

&lt;big&gt;That difficult word order...&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==Issues==

Word order in Dutch is not easy for speakers of English or one of the Romance languages. We have already seen a number of issues above that may well drive Anglophone learners of Dutch a little crazy. The three main ones are:

#Inversion: reversing the order of the subject and the finite verb (See [[Dutch/Lesson 11|Lesson 11]])
#Subjunction: a different word order in a dependent clause (See [[Dutch/Lesson 11|Lesson 11]])
#Separability:  separable verbs can split and combine (See [[Dutch/Lesson 18|Lesson 18]])

These three issues are mainly concerned with the verbs in the sentence.

However, pronominal adverbs are also separable (See [[Dutch/Lesson 8|Lesson 8]]) and this is part of a more general, fourth issue: the position of other parts of the sentence, like adverbial expressions or objects. It is also different from English. 

Obviously in a Dutch sentence these four issues may very well combine and interfere with each other.

This lesson will try to tie the issues together a bit and expand on the fourth issue.

===Two poles===

In English a sentence typically has a basic &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;V&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;O&lt;/font&gt; structure: &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;subject&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;verb&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;object&lt;/font&gt;

:E.g.: &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;The farmer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;plows&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;the field&lt;/font&gt;

Dutch has the same order in this case

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;ploegt&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt;

But this resemblance is a bit deceptive. This becomes clear when we have a compound verb in the sentence.
In English &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;V&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;O&lt;/font&gt; continues to hold for the perfect tense for example:

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;The farmer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;has plowed&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;the field&lt;/font&gt;

But in Dutch this is ''not'' the case. The finite part of the verb 'has' - 'heeft' remains in the same position, but the participle 'geploegd' moves to end of the sentence, forming a second verbal pole:

: &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;heeft&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd&lt;/font&gt;

That means that Dutch is not really an &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;V&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;O&lt;/font&gt; language. We could say that the Dutch structure has two verbal poles: &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;O&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

The second pole does not just attract past participles, but also infinitives, e.g. in the future tense

: &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;zal&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;ploegen&lt;/font&gt;

Also the adverbial prefix of a separable verb, like omhakken, moves to the second pole:

: &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;hakt&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;de boom&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;om&lt;/font&gt;

In a dependent clause the role of the second pole even becomes dominant, because even the finite verb moves to &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;: 

: Ik zeg dat &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;de boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd heeft&lt;/font&gt;
: Ik zeg dat &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;de boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;heeft geploegd&lt;/font&gt;

(Both versions occur: Dutch word order is less uniform than the English one).
In either case the order is &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;O&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;V&lt;/font&gt;!

In English the order simply remains &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;V&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;O&lt;/font&gt;:

:I say that &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;the farmer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;has plowed&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;the field&lt;/font&gt;

==Adverbs==
Adverbial expressions typically end up ''between'' the two poles.

E.g. ''gisteren'' - ''yesterday''

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;ploegde&lt;/font&gt; -'''gisteren''' - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;heeft&lt;/font&gt; -'''gisteren''' - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd&lt;/font&gt; 
:Ik weet dat &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;de boer&lt;/font&gt;  -'''gisteren''' - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd heeft&lt;/font&gt; 

Notice that in Dutch the adverbial expression typically comes ''before'' the object. It is possible to swap the object and the adverbial expression, -which resembles English word order more-, but this tends to put emphasis on the adverb:

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;heeft&lt;/font&gt;  - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; -'''gísteren''' -&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd&lt;/font&gt; (niet: vandaag)

It also possible to put the adverbial expression up front, but then it triggers inversion of the subject and the finite verb:

:'''Gisteren''' - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;heeft&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;de boer&lt;/font&gt;   - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt;  -&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd&lt;/font&gt; 

In the front position there is a mild emphasis on the adverb, but often it is just a way to accommodate more than one adverbial expression. Compare:

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;heeft&lt;/font&gt; -'''gisteren''' - '''met de tractor'''- &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd&lt;/font&gt; 

:'''Gisteren''' - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;heeft&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;de boer&lt;/font&gt; - '''met de tractor'''  - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt;  -&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd&lt;/font&gt; 

The order of the adverbial expressions in usually   '''when''' - '''how''' - '''where''':
:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Ik&lt;/font&gt;- &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;ben&lt;/font&gt; -'''gisteren''' - '''met de trein'''- '''naar Brussel'''  - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gereisd&lt;/font&gt; 

===niet===
Negation in Dutch is done by adding the adverb ''niet''. It gets its own position:

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;ploegde&lt;/font&gt; -'''gisteren''' - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - '''niet'''
:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;De boer&lt;/font&gt; - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;heeft&lt;/font&gt; -'''gisteren''' - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - '''niet''' - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd&lt;/font&gt; 
:Ik weet dat &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;de boer&lt;/font&gt;  -'''gisteren''' - &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het veld&lt;/font&gt; - '''niet''' - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;geploegd heeft&lt;/font&gt; 

We could put it before ''gisteren'', but that changes the meaning to: not yesterday (but today). 

Sometimes, however, the negation is put between the adverbs, after the time expression:

The order of the adverbial expressions in usually   '''when''' - '''how''' - '''where''':
:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Ik&lt;/font&gt;- &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;ben&lt;/font&gt; -'''gisteren''' - '''niet''' - '''met de trein'''- '''naar Brussel'''  - &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gereisd&lt;/font&gt;

==Objects: direct, indirect and prepositional==
In Dutch the indirect object can be expression either with or without the preposition ''aan''. This is comparable to the situation in English:

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;He&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gave&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;cyan&quot;&gt;me&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;the book&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;He&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gave&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;the book&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;cyan&quot;&gt;to me&lt;/font&gt;

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Hij&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gaf&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;cyan&quot;&gt;mij&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het boek&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Hij&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gaf&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het boek&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;cyan&quot;&gt;aan mij&lt;/font&gt;

Notice that in both languages the real indirect object and its prepositional stand in have a different position in the sentence. This becomes clearer if we add some adverbial expressions to the Dutch sentences

:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Hij&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gaf&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;cyan&quot;&gt;mij&lt;/font&gt; '''gisteren''' '''op straat''' &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het boek&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Hij&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gaf&lt;/font&gt; '''gisteren''' '''op straat''' &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het boek&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;cyan&quot;&gt;aan mij&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Hij&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;heeft&lt;/font&gt; '''gisteren''' '''op straat''' &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;het boek&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;cyan&quot;&gt;aan mij&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;gegeven&lt;/font&gt;

Notice that the direct object gravitates towards the first pole. The prepositional version goes to the second.

We can swap most of the items in the sentence for emphasis, but not the indirect object one. Since Dutch has lost its case endings around 1600 in the spoken language there is only the word order to mark ''me'' as an indirect object.

In the written language there is exactly one exception: the third person plural (''them'') has two forms: hun for indirect objects and hen for direct and prepositional ones:

: Ik gaf hun het boek
: Ik gaf het boek aan hen

However, this distinction was artificially created in the 1630's by a grammarian and despite four centuries of schoolmasters hammering it in, the artificial word 'hen' will seldom be heard in the spoken language.

==Prepositional objects and pronominal adverbs==

There are more prepositional objects in Dutch besides the one with 'aan'. Many verbs show fixed combination with certain prepositions, e.g.:

:Meewerken met iets
:Deelnemen aan iets
:Gebrand zijn op iets

:E.g.: Hij heeft &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;aan deze wedstrijd&lt;/font&gt; deelgenomen

When the noun 'wedstrijd' is to replaced by a pronoun, Dutch turns the prepositional object into a pronominal adverb:

: Hij heeft &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;hieraan&lt;/font&gt; deelgenomen

However, pronominal adverbs are separable and the locative part (er, hier, daar, waar) tends towards the first pole, whereas the prepositional one tends towards the second. This becomes apparent when we add adverbial expressions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Fool's Gold Loaf is a rather unusual sandwich, consisting of a whole french loaf filled with margarine, bacon, peanut butter and jelly. It is famous for being a favorite of Elvis Presley

== Ingredients ==
* 2 T [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 1 loaf French white [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
* 1 lb / 450 g [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] slices
* 1 jar of smooth [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]]
* 1 jar of grape jelly (US), jam (UK)

== Procedure ==
# Preheat the oven to 350F/180C. Spread the margarine generously all over all sides of the loaf. Place it on a baking sheet in the oven.
# Meanwhile, fry the bacon in a bit of oil until it is crisp and drain it thoroughly on paper towels.
# Remove the loaf from the oven when it is evenly browned, after approximately 15 minutes. Slice the loaf lengthwise and hollow out the interior, leaving as much bread along the walls as desired. Slather a thick layer of peanut butter in the cavity of the loaf and follow with another thick layer of grape jelly. Use lots of both.
# Arrange the bacon slices inside the cavity, or, if desired, layer the bacon slivers between the peanut butter and jelly. Close the loaf, slice and eat.
Serves 8-10 for most people.

==Fixing the DLS, soonest!==
This is a proposal to fix the issues with bad content on the DLS, which is not the bad data itself, but the bad data when downloaded. The solution is like exterminating other vermin, the quickest way is to remove their food supply, so to here I propose we remove the errors with automatic computer data shuffling. 

Here's the base N3V survival problem. The new user knows squat about fixing errors, or the perils of downloading a route. The secondary issue, is that those of us who do know that minefield still get stuck with the time-sink of fixing errors when assaying a new route. Since Many routes have dependencies with issues OR, those which have missing dependencies (''as bad to my thinking''), the goal is to deal with such ASAP as a community, and a corporate partner... 
{{TOCright}}
So the strategy is to isolate those with issues, isolate the supporting cast of assets with issues, and isolate those which may have issues... leaving a set of clean problem free assets and routes on the new skinnier DLS that can be safely downloaded by even a third grader without much ado. 

THAT resultant will become the new default DLS on a diet. The other stages are user accessible web pages where one can shop and download knowing you may face a risk. In general, new users won't find out about those until they've been around long enough to not get discouraged. 

Lastly, I've a number of proposed methods for curing the new backlog, the assets with problems, the missing assets, and so forth. Again, I invoke computer automation with a little software assist from N3V. It's their mess, they benefit most from the attractiveness of the DLS. It's time they supported a system of expedited fixes.

==What are those==
What are those other websites you ask, how will that work. Some may wonder if it will be expensive. (Compared to alienating customers? Just the opposite.) Well, simple, they're clones of [https://www.auran.com/TRS2004/DLS.php This TRS2004/DLS.php] website, just like a page such as [https://www.auran.com/TRS2004/DLS_viewasset.php?AssetID=193416 this snoop page] can be accessed. I presume they'd reside in another harddrive, possibly might need a separate computer, but we aren't talking a large outlay here, a few thousands in equipments should cover it with room to spare. The key difference is they will have a different URL, perhaps TRS2004/DLS-1.php, TRS2004/DLS-2.php, TRS2004/DLS-3.php or some more clever link namings. Whether they are organized as a sub-page, a permanent url, or whatnot I leave to the preferences of N3Vs webmaster and management. The point is there is little hardware and little software needed, there already exists a pipeline into the DLS for vetted and approved assets conformal to V2.9 or above. There already exists an link to the shopping carts in Simulator Central, and capacity to have that shopping cart trigger a download. 
 
Our only requirements in this specification are that
# they duplicate the search capabilities of the TRS2004 DLS
# They too can feed the shopping cart for download enqueuing
## --preferentially with a different background color to minimize confusion
## --they can transfer data to and fro to the other cloned DLS variants at need, 
## or most importantly, via a channel with filtering supplied by the N3V programmers as discussed below.

==Homage==
This 'naming' is a homage, a tribute to daytime children's programming when CABLE TV hadn't yet been invented. Don't know how international the [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;search=Three+Stooges&amp;go=Go Three Stooges reruns] were, but the FIVE-to-SEVEN stooges (They had some cast turn over in 45 years) were a vaudeville act gone to Movie Shorts and then Television shorts/programs and ran over four decades as a popular USA entertainment act. 'Larry' was wild haired and 'Curly' was Bald, while 'Moe' had a trademark bowl-snipped hairdo and sometimes sported a Hitleresque mustache but was always the boss except when they debuted in film with Shemp as the principal actor. Their skits relied heavily on abusing the others with eye-pokes and rump kicks, head-knocks and other slapstick comic stuff before society went over soft to the Nanny State motif. Their names are somewhat symbolic of stages in a process aimed to  cleaning up the mess on the DLS... ''quickly''

==Shemp==
&lt;b&gt;Shemp&lt;/b&gt; had an successful independent Hollywood and stage career and seen chronologically in their shorts output was a Curly replacement. (Actually Curly replaced Shemp initially&amp;mdash;but he returned to the act over a decade later when brother Curly had a series of career and life-ending strokes) so because he's disorderly&amp;mdash;with a hairdo from hell&amp;mdash;we'll let him represent a &lt;b&gt;clone of the current DLS&lt;b&gt;, warts and all&amp;mdash;with one important change:
# '''SHEMP will not know what ''a 'simple KUID'''''' is but input the DLS as it is now&amp;mdash;but as all as ALL KUID2 formats&lt;big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;... with any luck the software gurus will sense the obvious next nicety, a wildcard capability! &lt;!--
---&gt;
# Shemp normally talks only to Curly, except for two highly constrained specific cases:
## unless Larry asks for something,
## or Moe tells him what to do. 
# Shemp will not output Class Y category-class assets, Maps, Scenarios, Sessions, except to Larry, but then if and only if Larry asks. 
# When told by Moe, Shemp will delete a map, session, or scenario. Moe does that only because he's received all the assets on the route, session, or scenario from Larry. {{bullR}}Signifies a complete ready to run session and route! Yea, team!{{bullR}}For those of you following, I sense you sensing that Moe will be holding the new DLS when this all works through.
# When asked, Shemp will pass other assets to Curly, beginning with simplest most likely to be building block assets, then progressively higher organized kinds of assets.
# then delete them when Curly says they're received and error checked.
# Curly will not tell Shemp to delete assets with errors.
Like sand running through an hour=glass, the implication here, good assets, once vetted (and the method assumes this will likely take some time) or repaired leave Curly and Shemp, and in the end, Shemp will end holding only routes with faulty content, Curly only faulty assets.
{{text-box|
:&lt;big&gt;*&lt;/big&gt; Simple kuid's have outlived their usefulness, particularly as they confuse string searching. Since &lt;kuid:WWWXXX:YYYZZZ&gt; can be specified  &lt;kuid2:WWWXXX:YYYZZZ:0&gt;, both are redundant. Ironically, once everything is coded for kuid2 formats, I'd advocate (now that the statisticaly population is everything) converting all back to kuids, the 2 then being redundant.
}}

==Curly==
# Assume the next '''Curly''' is a website you can also stimulate into adding items into a shopping cart, which you can then download. Make the same assumption for each of the others... that downloading of a cart is already in place, n'est pas? Everyone thinking that five pages adding to same cart would overwhelm N3Vs technical capacity, please raise your hand.  OK, Shane, you stay after school. &lt;G&gt;&lt;!--
---&gt;
## Curly can not get any Sessions, scenarios, or Routes from Shemp, and when Shemp passes the assets on, he must delete them when curly tells him the Kuid2 is OKAY, leaving him holding only Sessions, Routes, and Scenarios--and assets with Errors... (like my CM!) &lt;!--
---&gt;
# Meanwhile Curly tests the component assets in a prioritized scheme, based on category-class tags and KINDs from simplest to most complicated. More or less, I'd initially think to  prioritize searching and input by:  &lt;!--
---&gt;
## { G= Ground, E= Environment, J= Textures, H= meshes, I= Product, F= Foliage, O= Organisms, V= Vehicles, Z= Train Parts, M=Maintenance Of Way, W= Wayside, T=Track, S= Splines, B= Buildings, A= Motive Power, and rolling stock C,D,L,P,R,X } with a deliberate hold on Y= Maps and scenarios, sessions. &lt;!--
---&gt;
## All assets of '''{the set''': {{bullR
}}'''Class &quot;A&quot;        Motive Power''', Class &quot;B&quot;        Buildings and Structure, {{Col
|Class &quot;C&quot;        Cabees,|blue}}{{bullR

|Class &quot;Y&quot;        Maps and Scenario,|blue}}{{bullR
}} '''Class &quot;Z&quot;        Train Parts &lt;br/&gt;}'''  &lt;!--
---&gt;
# Those which pass testing for TRS2006-SP1 (upto TC3--higher formats later by Larry) are copied and passed onto LARRY then...
## Curly then auto-modifies these substituting an annotation at the end of the description text ''&quot;This asset auto-updated by DLS automation bot CURLY on 2014-0415, Happy Tax Day!'' and promoting the KUID2 to the next vacant level. That will usually be '+:1'  so &lt;KUID2:WWW:XXX:1&gt; for oldest assets (&lt;KUID2:WWW:XXX:0&gt; is the same as &lt;KUID:WWW:XXX&gt;, lowest numbers most often, trainz-build tag to 2.6. Then passes those also onto Larry.
## That leaves Curly Holding a bag full of broken assets
## and assets with missing KUIDS (unbroken assets with missing dependencies)... Curly holds onto these until Larry asks for them.

==Larry==
;gets pre-vetted assets needing more TLC
Larry is more clever than Curly as every fan knows. He's going to run the list of KUID2s from Curly and edit the files and folders of v2.6 to v2.8, translating data structures and tags, auto-annotating the description records ... making them TS2009 compliant (v2.9). &lt;!--
---&gt;
 
Note, that if N4V wants to raise that v2.9 import threshold in the future, this facility will be in place. A little code tweak, and TANE compliant assets could in theory be produced sans our time being spent like our minutes are as cheap as raindrops in the Amazon during a thunderstorm. &lt;!--
---&gt;
# The software for this is straight forward, for every migration N3V has made in the SIMPLER, OLDER data structures, they've made a more generalized more flexible analog, usually (ALMOST ALWAYS) using containers and/or texture.txt file expansions--EACH OF WHICH extended the flexibility and capabilities of optional asset behaviors. &lt;!--
---&gt;
# Most of these can be defaulted by Larry as they do and have done for over a decade in their run time (read-in) code now. &lt;!--
---&gt;
## Since this is a pipeline translation, one approach would be to write filters, say five or six a day, old format to new (You know and I know they'll steal code from existing source files, so five a day isn't going to take very much of a chunk out of their schedules.), and run those against this DB until you've nothing left to convert. &lt;!--
---&gt;
### Filters for those unfamiliar with the concept are short programs using standard I/O facilities which can be 'piped' input to the previous output, and so on in a chain. 
### Filters have been at the heart of Unix, sysix, linux, C, and even DOS and Window since the IBM PC debut stabilized the home computer market and overnight practically killed off most the operating systems competing with MSDOS (and eventually Windoze).
### Since you can chain them, you can also batch them, so bundle a set inside a batch file, selecting apropos sequences of filters to process this KIND of asset or that.  
## Converted files are promoted with another KUID2 bump up and passed onto Moe, lucky bossy loud, Moe! &lt;!--
---&gt;
### One key to this is Moe continues the current vetting of assets to V2.9, whereas in this schema, the current DLS's clone )(SHEMP) would be able to resume accepting upgrades to assets by their own content creators to versions v2.6-v2.8; he passes them onto Curly, and an intermediate KUID (v2.0--V2.8) can resume being entered into the system. Thus partially updated assets can be pulled from our CMs and be fed to the rest of the community. Curly will need to read &amp; run an CMP/TrainzUtil extract to vett for TRS2006-TC3 errors.
### Another asset upgrade schema in this thinking is a two way automatic data flow. LARRY requests an asset from his source Curly, but the asset Curly has, has a (potentially insoluable) problem (needing human intervention); meanwhile N3V sets it up so people volunteer and sign up and those accepting get a small add-on utility or patch from N3V which allows N3V to query for a locally modified kuid/asset. Curly initiates this process for &lt;KUID whatever&gt; when our volunteer's CM logs into the site and finds 3-5 users with the asset 'Locally Repaired' (and faultless!). 
### The system reads three to five such from it's community partners via the tweaked TrainzUtil or whatnot program and compares the 3-5 excluding text babble lines to find three that are matches in the important data definition fields and subfolders. They don't even have to match in username tags--obsolescent tags are trimmed, Photos excluded, as are descriptions, licensing, and the other verbose text tags in the TrainzBaseSpec. A binary comparison finds three matches from community donors, and the asset is replace by the winner under the original name and description, licenses, company, et. al. In the event there is a disagreement (say a texture.txt file on one has an AlphaMask= set to a different state, the program would refer these 'fixed assets' to a human for selection of the best. &lt;!--
---&gt;
# '''''Folks my brain is fried tonight''''', so this is the draft promised, albeit unfinished and lacking polish. You should get the gist by now. I'll see if I can finish this by tomorrow afternoon. N3V's in their weekend schedule so a day more won't slow anything down. // [[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 06:30, 5 April 2014 (UTC) &lt;!--
---&gt;
## When Larry's done with basic assets, the only thing left will be things he can't convert, so the humans will go back to write more filters. '''''Very futuristic''', eh... Men working for the computer taskmaster!'' &lt;G&gt; &lt;!--
---&gt;
# At some point though, the computer will be taken to task by the human slaves and told to start requesting routes from Shemp by starting with scenarios, then sessions, and working on dependent routes.  &lt;!--
---&gt;
## Assets all accounted for, get passed to Moe as happy faces. &lt;!--
---&gt;
## Assets with errors get sent to CURLY! (He was feeling left out of the sessions and routes biz) &lt;!--
---&gt;
## Assets with missing dependencies make Larry Sad. He holds onto those, and from time to time checks against the input stream to see if there's news of a missing asset. &lt;!--
---&gt;

==MOE ==


==Costs==
Now for the price of a few url pages, and a few hard drives, this should be feasible using N3V's servers alone. The general scheme is to divide, conquer, and quarantine. Then update and userfy working content to new standards with apropos kuid advancements.

Some 'asset validation' software will need to be customized by Windwalkr and company, but that should be mostly extracts from prior Trainz released make file resources (source code), and they'll have to work out piping data from server to server (I/O). 

Designate Curly to get Content with bad content (errors). 
Designate MOE to get all vetted and approved ERROR FREE content without missing dependencies

==End==

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is about OpenMP, a language extension to C (and C++) that allows for easy parallel programming. To understand what OpenMP makes possible, it is first important to know what parallel programming is and what it isn't.

''[[:w:en:Parallel computing|Parallel programming]]'' means writing software that operates on several compute devices at the same time. For the purpose of this book, a &quot;compute device&quot; is primarily a processor (CPU) or a processor core within a multicore CPU, which is the focus of OpenMP 3. In other settings, a compute device may mean a full-blown computer within a cluster of computers, or a different type of device such as a graphic processing unit (GPU). An extension of OpenMP to cluster computing has been devised by Intel, and OpenMP 4 adds supports for executing code on non-CPU devices, but these are outside the scope of this book.

Parallel programming is mainly done to speed up computations that have to be fast. Ideally, if you have ''n'' compute devices (cores) to run a program, you'd want the program to be ''n'' times as fast as when it runs on a single device. This ideal situation never occurs in practice because the compute devices need to communicate with each other, sending and waiting for messages such as &quot;give me the result of your computation&quot;. Still, parallel programming can speed up many applications.

Parallel programming should be distinguished from ''[[:w:en:Concurrent computing|concurrent programming]]'', which means breaking down a program into processes that conceptually run at the same time. There is considerable overlap between parallel and concurrent programs: both involve decomposing a task into distinct subtasks that can be executed separately, and concurrent programs can benefit from having their tasks run on multiple compute devices in parallel. However, full concurrent programming is a different art from that of parallel programming in that usually, different types of communication occur between concurrent tasks than between parallel tasks.
&lt;!-- example of concurrent programming needed --&gt;

OpenMP adds support for parallel programming to C in a very clean way. Unlike thread libraries, little change is needed to existing programs to have them run on multiple processors in parallel. In fact, the basic constructs of OpenMP are so non-intrusive that programs using them but compiled by a compiler that doesn't support OpenMP will still work (although sequentially, of course). To see what that means, consider the following C function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void broadcast_sin(double *a, size_t n)
{
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        a[i] = sin(a[i]);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This function &quot;broadcasts&quot; the sine function over an array, storing its results back into that same array. When OpenMP is enabled in the compiler, it will in fact do so using multiple threads, but without OpenMP, it will still function and produce the exact same effect.

[[Image:Fork join.svg|thumb|right|400px|Illustration of the fork–join model: the program splits (&quot;forks&quot;) into sections that are executed in parallel and join into a sequential section when done. This occurs multiple times over the lifetime of the program.]]
OpenMP programs work according to a so-called [[:w:en:Fork–join model|fork–join model]], illustrated on the right. The OpenMP runtime maintains a thread pool, and every time a parallel section is encountered, it distributes work over the threads in the pool. When all threads are done, sequential execution is resumed.</text>

      <comment>/* A parallel way of summing */ dot product exercise</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Summing floating point numbers==
For our first parallel program, we turn to an age-old problem: summing an array of floating point numbers. The basic algorithm to solve this problem is so simple that it allows us to focus on OpenMP features rather than algorithmic details, but we'll see in a bit that the problem is actually less trivial than it appears at first.

Without further ado, here's a sequential algorithm to sum a list of floating point numbers:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;  // for size_t

float sum(const float *a, size_t n)
{
    float total;
    size_t i;

    for (i = 0, total = 0.; i &lt; N; i++) {
        total += a[i];
    }
    return total;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

As far as algorithms go, this one is as simple as it gets. Put the definition above in a file &lt;code&gt;isum.c&lt;/code&gt; (iterative sum).

:If you have experience dealing with floating point numbers, you might be tempted to make &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt; a &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; instead of a &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; for added precision. Don't do that just yet, as we'll solve the precision issue in a different way in a bit.

To test our algorithm, we need a driver program, which we'll put in a file &lt;code&gt;main.c&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

float sum(const float *, size_t);

#define N 1000000  // we'll sum this many numbers

int main()
{
    float *a = malloc(N * sizeof(float));
    if (a == NULL) {
        perror(&quot;malloc&quot;);
        return 1;
    }

    // fill the array a
    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        a[i] = .000001;
    }

    printf(&quot;%f\n&quot;, sum(a, N));
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

And finally we need some way to build this program. On Linux/Unix/OS X, the following &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; should do the job. It assumes you're using GCC.

&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
# C99 extensions are not necessary for OpenMP, but very convenient
CFLAGS = -fopenmp -Wall -std=c99
LDFLAGS = -fopenmp

OBJS = main.o isum.o

# when copy-pasting the following, be aware that the indent must be a tab, not spaces
sum: $(OBJS)
        $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o sum $(OBJS)
&lt;/source&gt;

Now compile the program with &lt;code&gt;make sum&lt;/code&gt;, run it and see how fast it is with a tool such as &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt;. If it's too fast to measure, consider changing &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; to a larger number, or run &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; in a loop instead of just once.

===A parallel way of summing===
We had to go through a bit of setup, but now we're ready to make a parallel sum algorithm for floating point numbers. Here it is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;  // for size_t

float sum(const float *a, size_t n)
{
    float total = 0.;

    #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:total)
    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        total += a[i];
    }
    return total;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;#pragma omp parallel for&lt;/code&gt; turns the loop into a ''parallel loop''. If you have two cores, OpenMP will (probably) use two threads that each run half of the loop. The &lt;code&gt;reduction(+:total)&lt;/code&gt; declares that we're [[:w:en:Fold (higher-order function)|reducing]] the input array by summing into the variable &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt;, so after the partial loops are done, their results must be summed into this variable.

Put this in &lt;code&gt;isum.c&lt;/code&gt; and recompile. Now run the program. Do you get the same output as before?

:''Exercise'': run the program with various settings for the environment variable &lt;code&gt;OMP_NUM_THREADS&lt;/code&gt;, which controls the size of the thread pool that OpenMP uses. Try 1, 2, 4 and 8. Do you see the same results for each setting? Now try absurdly large number of threads, e.g. 16000. How does this affect performance?

:''Exercise'': the [[:w:en:Dot product|dot product]] of two vectors is the sum of products of their respective entries, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i&lt;/math&gt;. Adapt the &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; function to a &lt;code&gt;dot&lt;/code&gt; function for computing dot products in parallel.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Setting up your compiler==

To do any useful OpenMP programming, you will need a compiler that supports it.

* The [http://gcc.gnu.org/ GNU C Compiler] (GCC) has OpenMP 3.1 support since version 4.7. This compiler comes with practically any Linux system; for instance, on Ubuntu you can install it (and a set of related tools) with &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install build-essential&lt;/code&gt;. To find out the version of GCC that you have installed, issue &lt;code&gt;gcc --version&lt;/code&gt; on the command line.
* The Intel C Compiler supports OpenMP.
* The Clang compiler, [https://trac.macports.org/wiki/UsingTheRightCompiler shipped with Apple's Xcode], does not support OpenMP as of April 2014, but an [http://clang-omp.github.io/ experimental version by Intel] does.
* Microsoft Visual C++ apparently has limited support for OpenMP, depending on the version.
* The LLVM-GCC compiler, shipped with older versions of Apple's Xcode, does not support OpenMP.

The [http://openmp.org/wp/openmp-compilers/ OpenMP website] has a more complete list of compilers with OpenMP support.

Apart from a compiler, we'll also be using the &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; tool in this book. You can do without if you want to use a different build system.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:AMD Opteron Six Cores.jpg|thumb|right|A six-core AMD processor. OpenMP programs can run on all six cores simultaneously.]]
Welcome to the Wikibook ''Parallel Programming with OpenMP''! This short book serves as a tutorial for the [[:w:en:OpenMP|OpenMP]] framework for parallel programming, using the C programming language. It discusses how to easily create parallel programs in C, or add parallel constructs to existing sequential code to make it run faster on multiprocessor and multicore machines.

* This book assumes you are already familiar with either C or C++. While the examples are in C, OpenMP works very similarly in C++ and the techniques discussed usually carry over to C++ with few modifications. We won't discuss OpenMP support in Fortran.
* The examples in this book are mostly numerical algorithms, but it is not too heavy on the math. OpenMP is popular in the scientific computing world, but it can just as easily be employed in games, server programs, or any other program that has to do a lot of computation.
* The emphasis in this book is on the OpenMP 3 standard and programming for multicore CPUs. While OpenMP 4 adds interesting new features including support for vector instructions, GPUs and accelerators, OpenMP 3 is better supported by current C and C++ compilers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Tajikistan=
&lt;br&gt;
* &lt;font size=3&gt;Tajikistan was a region of the former Soviet Union which became independent in 1991. Meter stamps with former Soviet Union markings (“CCCP”, hammer and sickle logo, etc) continued to be used after independence. Although it is probable meter stamps inscribed Tadzhikistan are in use, examples are not known to us.
&lt;/font&gt;

      <comment>speed it up (forgot the pragma omp single)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">If you followed along with the [[../Reductions|previous chapter]] and did the exercises, you'll have discovered that the sum function we developed was quite unstable. (To be fair, we set up the data to show the instability.) In fact, the naive way of summing has &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; round-off error: the error is proportional to the number of elements we sum. We can fix this by changing the summation algorithm. There are three candidates for a stable sum algorithm:

* Sort the number from small to large, then sum them as before. Problem: this changes the complexity of the problem from linear to &lt;math&gt;O(n \log n)&lt;/math&gt;.
* Use [[:w:en:Kahan summation algorithm|Kahan's algorithm]]. While this algorithm takes linear time and is very stable, it is quite slow in practice and harder to parallelize then our third alternative, which is
* [[:w:en:Divide and conquer algorithms|divide-and-conquer]] recursion. The round-off error for such an algorithm is &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. proportional to the logarithm of the number of elements.

The basic divide and conquer summation is very easy to express in C:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
float sum(const float *a, size_t n)
{
    // base cases
    if (n == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    else if (n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }

    // recursive case
    size_t half = n / 2;
    return sum(a, half) + sum(a + half, n - half);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If you use this definition of &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; in the program we developed for the previous chapter, you'll see that it produces exactly the expected result. But this algorithm doesn't have a loop, so how do we make a parallel version using OpenMP?

We'll use the tasks construct in OpenMP, treating the problem as task-parallel instead of data parallel. In a first version, the task-recursive version of &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; looks like

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
float sum(const float *a, size_t n)
{
    // base cases
    if (n == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    else if (n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }

    // recursive case
    size_t half = n / 2;
    float x, y;

    #pragma omp parallel
    #pragma omp single nowait
    {
        #pragma omp task shared(x)
        x = sum(a, half);
        #pragma omp task shared(x)
        y = sum(a + half, n - half);
        #pragma omp taskwait
        x += y;
    }
    return x;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

We introduced two tasks, each of which sets a variable that is declared &lt;code&gt;shared&lt;/code&gt; with the other task. If we did not declare the variables shared, each task would set its own local variable, then throw away the results. We then wait for the tasks to complete with &lt;code&gt;#pragma omp taskwait&lt;/code&gt; and combine the recursive results.

You may be surprised by the &lt;code&gt;#pragma omp parallel&lt;/code&gt; followed immediately by &lt;code&gt;#pragma omp single nowait&lt;/code&gt;. The thing is that the first pragma causes all of the threads in the pool to execute the next block of code. The &lt;code&gt;single&lt;/code&gt; directive causes all threads but one (usually the first to encounter the block) to not execute it, while the &lt;code&gt;nowait&lt;/code&gt; turns off the barrier on the single; there's already a barrier on the enclosing &lt;code&gt;parallel&lt;/code&gt; region, to which the other threads will rush.

Unfortunately, if you actually try to run this code, you'll find that it's still not extremely fast. The reason is that the tasks are much too fine-grained: near the bottom of the recursion tree, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{n}{2}&lt;/math&gt; invocations are splitting two-element arrays into subtasks that process one element each. We can solve this problem by introducing, apart from the base and recursive cases, an &quot;intermediate case&quot; for the recursion which is recursive, but does not involve setting up parallel tasks: if the recursion hits a prespecified cutoff, it will no longer try to set up tasks for the OpenMP thread pool, but will just do the recursive sum itself.

:''Exercise'': introduce the additional case in the recursion and measure how fast the program is. Don't peek ahead to the next program, because it contains the solution to this exercise.

Now we effectively have two recursions rolled into one: one with a parallel recursive case, and a serial one. We can disentangle the two to get better performance, by doing less checks at each level. We also separate the parallel setup code to a driver function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;

#define CUTOFF 100  // arbitrary

static float parallel_sum(const float *, size_t);
static float serial_sum(const float *, size_t);

float sum(const float *a, size_t n)
{
    float r;

    #pragma omp parallel
    #pragma omp single nowait
    r = parallel_sum(a, n);
    return r;
}

static float parallel_sum(const float *a, size_t n)
{
    // base case
    if (n &lt;= CUTOFF) {
        return serial_sum(a, n);
    }

    // recursive case
    float x, y;
    size_t half = n / 2;

    #pragma omp task shared(x)
    x = parallel_sum(a, half);
    #pragma omp task shared(y)
    y = parallel_sum(a + half, n - half);
    #pragma omp taskwait
    x += y;

    return x;
}

static float serial_sum(const float *a, size_t n)
{
    // base cases
    if (n == 0) {
        return 0.;
    }
    else if (n == 1) {
        return a[0];
    }

    // recursive case
    size_t half = n / 2;
    return serial_sum(a, half) + serial_sum(a + half, n - half);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This technique works better when the code inside the parallel tasks spends more time computing and less time doing memory accesses, because those may need to be synchronized between processors.

There's one big downside to the above code: it has an ugly magic constant called &lt;code&gt;CUTOFF&lt;/code&gt; that we need to tune by hand. We can prevent this by stopping the parallel recursion not at a fixed cutoff, but when we're using all threads. So, we ask OpenMP how many threads it has in the driver, and split the parallel work until we find we're running code serially.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;omp.h&gt;
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;

static float parallel_sum(const float *, size_t, int);
static float serial_sum(const float *, size_t);

float sum(const float *a, size_t n)
{
    float r;
    int n_threads = omp_get_num_threads();

    #pragma omp parallel
    #pragma omp single nowait
    r = parallel_sum(a, n, n_threads);
    return r;
}

static float parallel_sum(const float *a, size_t n, int n_threads)
{
    // base case
    if (n_threads &lt;= 1) {
        return serial_sum(a, n);
    }

    // recursive case
    float x, y;
    int half_threads = n_threads / 2;
    size_t half = n / 2;

    #pragma omp task shared(x)
    x = parallel_sum(a, half, half_threads);
    #pragma omp task shared(y)
    y = parallel_sum(a + half, n - half, n_threads - half_threads);
    #pragma omp taskwait
    x += y;

    return x;
}

static float serial_sum(const float *a, size_t n)
{
    // as before
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This way, we lose the ability to compile the exact same code without OpenMP support, but fortunately the OpenMP standard gives us the preprocessor macro &lt;code&gt;_OPENMP&lt;/code&gt;, so with two small changes...

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#ifdef _OPENMP
#include &lt;omp.h&gt;
#endif
&lt;/source&gt;

and

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#ifdef _OPENMP
int n_threads = omp_get_num_threads();
#else
int n_threads = 1;
#endif
&lt;/source&gt;

our code no longer depends on OpenMP.</text>

[[Image:Locrio de Pollo (Dominicano).jpg|right|200px]]
A Locrio is a common Dominican dish, similar to paella. Like Paella, there are many variations. The main point is to have a little tomato sauce/paste for coloring, and some caramelized sugar. In that way it is similar to the Trinidadian Pilau.

Like Paella, the rice at the bottom should be toasted or browned, but not burnt. This browned rice is called &quot;concon&quot;. You're not considered a good cook until you can do this. 

== Ingredients ==
* 4 lbs (1.8kg) [[Cookbook:Chicken|Chicken]] cut up, alternatively one can use guineafowl, rabbit, Dominican salami, pork chops, or other meat, cut in pieces. 
* ½ [[Cookbook:Cup|C]] Olives (pitted, preferably) or Capers.
* ¼ C Oil for frying
* 2 Tbsp Oil, used later when rice is almost done
* 1 Tbsp sugar
===Liquids and rice===
* 4 C [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* 5¼ C Chicken [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]] or water
* ¼ C tomato paste (mix it in the water/stock until smooth)
===The Sofrito===
* ½ C finely diced [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
* ½ C finely diced [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 2 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], chopped.
===Seasonings===
* 1 tsp salt or to taste
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]
* ½ tsp Oregano (if desired)
* 1 tsp ground black pepper

== Procedure ==
This recipe is in three steps: first caramelize the sugar, fry the meat / vegetables, then cook it with the rice. 

===Caramelizing the sugar===
#Put the oil in the pot, and heat on high heat
#Put in the tablespoon of sugar.
#It will melt, then turn brown.

Note: pay close attention and don't let the sugar burn. Adding the chicken brings the temperature down. Also don't use plastic utensils to stir the sugar, since it will be at around 400F (200C), which will melt plastic. Use wooden or metal utensils, but the sugar may stick to it.
 
===Frying the meat===
#Add the meat (chicken, guineafowl, rabbit, etc.) and let it brown on both sides.
#Remove the meat
#Fry the garlic, onions, and celery

===Cooking rice===
#Add rice, meat, and all liquid
#Add the salt, pepper, and thyme
#Add olives or capers. 
#Although it is not authentic, you can add 1 tsp Ajinomoto (味の素). Some Dominicans add &quot;Sazón Completo&quot; which has MSG in it anyways. 
#Check the seasoning. If the salt is good, add an extra ½ tsp of salt. This is because the rice will absorb some of the salt, and it will come out a bit flat in the end. 
#On high heat, bring to a boil, and let it boil, stirring occasionally until the water is absorbed. (Note: the high heat is needed to bring the rice temperature up so that it cooks. If you lower the flame at this point, the rice might not cook all the way). 
#Cover, lower the heat, and let it cook 15 minutes.
#Uncover, sprinkle 2 Tbsp oil on top, and stir so that the uncooked rice on top goes to the bottom
#Give another 5 minutes.
#If rice still not cooked, give it another stir and another 5 minutes.
#Turn heat on high for a couple of minutes to brown (toast) the rice on bottom (sometimes it does this by itself during the main cooking so you don't have to do this. Experience will tell. 
#Serve.

== Notes ==
#If the rice doesn't cook, but all the water was absorbed, you can separate the rice from the meat, and put it in a bowl, and give it 5 minutes on high in the microwave. Often there wasn't enough heat to cook the rice.
#It is also helpful to put a sheet or two of aluminium foil over the pot before putting the lid on. That helps seal the lid and keep the heat / steam from escaping. Rice often comes out better. 
#Dominicans tend to cook the rice on the dry side: rice will be cooked through, but not too watery. The ratio should be 4 C rice to 5½ C liquid (some locrio recipes ask for 7 or 8 cups of liquid, which makes things mushy). If you have tomato sauce instead of tomato paste, you can use that also, as long as the ratios are the same (e.g. 1 C tomato sauce to 4½ C water/stock; which makes a total of 5½ C liquid). 
#Some people deep fry the meat separately, remove the excess oil, and then caramelize the sugar.
#The ingredients of the sofrito vary, and can be made in advance. Some add cilantro, bell peppers, culantro (''Eryngium foetidum'' a.k.a. recao, culantro coyote, etc.) and other aromatics to it.
#Other vegetables such as 1 cup of cubed auyama (squash) sometimes are added with the rice.
#Almost any meat can be used. Pork chops (smoked), cubed Dominican Salami, cubed ham or spam, Arrenque (smoked dried herring, pre-soaked in warm water to remove some salt, but cut the amount of salt you use), canned sardines, Vienna Sausages, shellfish (mariscos) and if in desperation, ground beef, meatballs, hot dogs, etc. can also be used. One can use 2 lbs of chicken gizzards also, but gizzards need to be boiled (or pressure cooked) until tender first. 
#Some people use Sazón Completo for the seasoning.
#One can take the skin off the chicken before frying it.
#Instead of chicken stock, some people throw in a bullion cube (sopapilla).

* &lt;font size=3&gt;The first postage meters were used in 1952.
* All stamps are inscribed “THAILAND”.
* Essays from 1928 with the country’s former name, “SIAM”, exist.

* The stamps are grouped according to appearance and usage:
:: A – Franks with outer frame line and separate town mark
:: B – Digital stamps with 2D barcode
:: PO – Stamps generated only by special Post Office machines
:: PV – Variable rate stamps generated by self-service vending machines

'''PO3'''. Unidentified local manufacturer (digital), 2008. 
: As PO2D but value figures are different, narrower and thicker, and with a wide space between the &quot;&lt;font size=3&gt;≋&lt;/font&gt;&quot; and the first digit.
: V/F: [[File:MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|12px]] &lt;font size=3&gt;≋&lt;/font&gt; 0.00 to &lt;font size=3&gt;≋&lt;/font&gt; 0,000.00 (maximum 99,999.00) 

:::::::::::::: '''a'''. Value figures without &quot;&lt;font size=3&gt;≋&lt;/font&gt;&quot;











'''NOTE''': Many minor variations of Types PO2 and PO3 can be found. The differences are in the font and font size and also in the image of the elephants. It is probable that Thai Post tweaks the operating system in these machines frequently.

&lt;font size=3&gt;&lt;font color=green&gt;The Hasler &quot;Mailmaster&quot; stamp shown below is inscribed entirely in Thai except for the town name at the bottom of the town mark. The status of the stamp is uncertain, but it may be a design used for local mail only.

&lt;font size=3&gt;* This island became a semi-independent nation in 2010 upon the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles. Adhesive postage stamps inscribed &quot;SINT MAARTIN&quot; have been issued, but meter stamps have not yet been reported to or seen by us. We assume they do exist.

      <comment>terminology regarding pickling brine</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Description of Brine ==
The article says &quot;[p]ickling brine is a moderately strong acid,&quot; but traditional pickling usually starts with a saltwater brine, often with spices added. The acidification is a result of lactic acid produced by the naturally present bacteria. Fresh pack pickling (what one will often see used by large companies) involves the pouring of a hot, spiced vinegar solution over cucumbers, but that isn't the traditional method. It's the salt in the brine that initially prevents microbial growth. Thus, I think this could be reworded to adhere to the typical definition of &quot;pickling.&quot; ([[User:Pcwendland|Pcwendland]] ([[User talk:Pcwendland|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pcwendland|contribs]]) 13:29, 6 April 2014 (UTC))</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Tristan Da Cunha=
&lt;br&gt;

* &lt;font size=3&gt;Tristan da Cunha is part of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. It has a population of only about 300 permanent inhabitants and so has little need for postage meters. Although it does issue traditional postage stamps - mainly for the philatelic trade - no meter stamp has ever been generated on this South Atlantic island.
