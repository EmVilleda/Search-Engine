      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How should personnel be evaluated?}}

It is common knowledge that by becoming a teacher your work, dedication, and your ability will somehow be evaluated. Even though every teacher must be evaluated in some form it is hard to decide exactly how to evaluate teachers. Should it be through peer evaluation or by interviews and observations of the administration? There are many ways to evaluate teachers and it is important to create a simple but effective system of evaluation that can be understood not only by principals and superintendents but by parents as well. It is important that we first take a look at exactly what an evaluation does and it “builds a written record for the performance of duties outlined in the job description. They should also be a reaffirmation of the skills and strengths the employee brings to the job, and may include a positive plan for personal improvement.”(National Education Association) This outline is the basis for what most administrators should be looking for when deciding on how to evaluate. 

==Types of Evaluation==
There are two types of evaluation that we as teachers should be concerned about. The first is the formative method of evaluation and the second is the summative form of evaluation.

=== Formative ===
Formative evaluation is the method of judging the worth of a program while the program activities are forming or happening. (SIL International, 1999) This definition translates into constant evaluation through out the marking period, semester, or trimester. Its benefits are that through constant evaluation your teachers could possibly have more control over their classroom be more adept to the performance of their students and have better rapport with the administration. The problem with this type of evaluation is that it does not allow for new teachers to be come comfortable with their teaching style and how it works without being judged right in the beginning of their new job.

=== Summative ===
Summative evaluation is the method of judging the worth of a program at the end of program activities. The focus is on the outcome. (SIL International, 1999) While using a summative type of evaluation the teacher is allowed a little more time to find out which way the students learn without having to have the pressure of a constant evaluation system on his/her hands judging and marking them right off the bat. It allows for new teachers to become comfortable in their environments without having to be pressured by early and constant evaluations. The downside to this type is that without constant evaluation it allows for bad teachers to be able to still have jobs even though they are under performing. Another downside is that as long as the teacher’s students have good grades at the end of the term the administration cannot tell if he/she is doing a bad job.

== How to Evaluate Personnel ==
There are many types of evaluations that can be used to get a better understanding of how teachers are progressing and if they are doing their job correctly. These include observations, third party evaluations, interviews, and surveys and questionnaires all of these add their own different points on how well a teacher is teaching.  

=== Observations ===
When talking about observations it is important to realize that the majority of school districts in the U.S. only use observations of 1-3 times a year as their main evaluation process. (England) These observations are usually done by the main administrator and by no one else. This is an out of date technique considering that teaching methods and teaching styles have changed dramatically within the last two decades. With the improvement of technology in the classroom as well as the understanding of different types of learning by students it is important to the school district as a whole to have more then one person do all the evaluating and more then 1-3 times a year. In fact a article found in the National Education Association website by a psychology professor and education researcher James Stigler we see a new innovative way to make observations happen more efficiently and often just by using a new video taping software. “Teachers have videotaped lessons for a long time, but the Lesson Lab software has taken this to a new level. Because the lessons are digitized and time coded, teachers can talk about specific incidents and watch them again without spending time getting to the right place on a tape. The software lets a teacher-observer watch someone else's lesson after school or at home, make notes on specific incidents, and share those notes with other people, either remotely or face-to-face.”(National Education Association)Whether or not this new innovation gets used around the world is not our concern but with this creation we are seeing a more effective way of evaluating teachers and also a new way of allowing more people to become involved in the evaluation system which is a very important aspect that gets pushed to the side to often. While doing the actual observations the observer should be looking for “organizational skills, communication ability, classroom product in the form of student achievement, ability to instigate meaningful and focused work in the classroom, and use of those affective components which reinforce teaching effectiveness.”(Lewy) The observer whether it is a principal or another teacher should also be aware of how the students are responding to the teacher’s style of education and write down constructive criticism or positive enforcement accordingly. I emphasize using observations more then three times a year because by going into the classroom and observing teachers it is easier for the school system as a whole to determine if a teacher is doing their job properly. Also by using more then just the administrator as the main evaluator you allow the opportunity to have more observations of more teachers in a shorter time period as well as a check on the observers that they are not being bias in any way at all.

===Interviews===
Interviewers “should be counsel from principals and other administrators and parents.”(Boyd) Interviews are the first step of evaluation when becoming a teacher and should be used more then that one time alone. In order to be hired as a teacher in a school district it is important to make a good first impression upon your future employers and we do this by interview. “Interviews can be used and should be used at least twice throughout the year and these should be done by administrators and by parents.”(England) Whether it is an administrator or a parents doing the interview they should have the same questions just in different contexts. While the parent only wants to know about their child the administrator should be concerned with the class as a whole. Interviews can give a inside look on how the teacher feels about their job and if they still have the same enthusiasm as they did when they had the first interview that lead to them getting the job. These inside looks from the parent’s perspective as well as the administrators should be looked at together in deciding not only how the interview went but if the goals and concerns are on track between the school system and the parent community. By evaluating through interviews the school district and parents get a sense of just how the teacher is teaching and if they are making accommodations for special circumstances such as learning disabilities.

=== Questionnaires and Surveys ===
Another important form of evaluation is questionnaires and surveys. By using these items we as teachers can keep a constant filing system or record of how our students perceive our teaching methods. Also by using these kinds of records the administration can take a look of how exactly the students feel about the way teachers teach.  These surveys and questionnaires can be given out by the teacher to their students as well as by the administrator to the parents. The surveys should be a more detailed approach of how the child’s educational growth has increased or decreased since coming into the teachers class.(Peterson) When using questionnaires towards students the teacher can get back numerous 1st hand accounts of the effectiveness of their own teaching styles. If these surveys are given out consistently through out the school year the teacher can find it easier to have the majority of their students succeed in the classroom. Also by doing this Administrators can look at what the students think of their teachers and make decisions upon a different kind of peer evaluation without causing conflict between teachers and the administration. By keeping conflict between the administration and teachers out of the equation the school district can see a better form of education and cooperation in the school. 

=== Student Performance ===
When evaluating by performance of the student on tests it becomes easier for the administration as well as the parents to track a child’s progress. The downside to this of course is the fact that some students who are exceptionally smart can have problems on standardized testing. “It is absolutely wrong to use only post-instruction test scores, such as grade level tests or state benchmark test scores, for any kind of teacher evaluation.
Because of the wide variability of student responsiveness to teaching, it is essential to adjust observed achievement in students according to information about students prior to the teacher effects of interest.”(Sanders) So even though it is a proper form of evaluation it does not take into account the actual ability for a student to learn. If used properly though together with all the other forms of evaluation it can become a very effective part of the evaluation system. So student performance can be an effective way to evaluate a teacher when used in compilation with other forms of evaluation.
     
== Conclusion ==
When asking the question how personnel should be evaluated? It is important to remember that evaluation should be looked at as a multi step process in which performance flexibility of the teacher and structure and ability need to be taken into account. If all these measures are not involved in the process the evaluation system as a whole will be inaccurate.  So by using questionnaires, surveys, observations, and interviews as well as picking a timely form of evaluation the administration as well as the parents can get an accurate view of how teachers are performing at the amazing task of shaping our youths future.

{{question-answer|question=Is student performance an accurate way of evaluating teachers? Why or why not?
|answer=Student performance itself is not an accurate way of evaluating teachers because it only looks at test scores and does not concentrate on the individual student. If an evaluation system only uses student performance as the only type of evaluation you are short changing the teacher and the student together. It is important for the evaluation system to be a process and not just a look at test scores. Evaluation should start with observations of the teacher then move into interviews, then questionnaires and surveys, and the finally student performance. Although student performance should be used in the evaluation process it should be the last step in the evaluation system because it is the overall outlook of how the student has progressed in the teachers classroom that is being evaluated.
----
Student performance is not an accurate way to evaluate teachers.  Each child is different, and even if a child is gaining from teachings, they could be a bad test taker. Therefore, just because a child does poorly, doesn’t mean they have a bad teacher.  There are much better ways to evaluate teachers.  These include observing, interviews, surveys, questionnaires, and third party evaluations are all great examples on how to evaluate a teacher.  There are two different types of evaluations.  One is summative, and the other is formative.  Formative would be evaluating an instructor while the lessons, or teachings are happening.  An observation would be an example of formative evaluation.  Summative evaluation is evaluating after the fact.  This means the judging takes place after the activities or lessons.  Although judging or evaluating a teacher can be hard, the best way is to experience what the students are experiencing.  This is why observation works so well.  The administrator watches the class, to see if the teacher performance is creditable. &amp;mdash;Katie Lauer}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What are the pros and cons of technology in the classroom?}}	

Imagine it is your daughter’s first day of work after her high school graduation.  She is working at a local company doing secretarial work to pay her way through college. Her new boss comes in and asks her to type the agenda for tomorrow’s meeting and email it to the staff by noon. When her boss walks away she just sits there wondering how she is going to complete this task in ample amount of time because she has no idea how to use the computer.  Is it her fault that she did not learn how to use the computer? Her teachers did not have time to allow her to use the computer much; they had to prepare her for all her SOLs in the spring.  At the same time, her school district had limited access to computers.  She attended a school that had one computer lab that was rarely used. Her teachers would tell the students that they did not have time to “play” on the computer they had to complete the curriculum.  

This is the reality of many high school graduates. They are not prepared with the necessary skills for the workplace.  However, the bigger problem is, it is not their fault for some reason they were not taught to use the computer in school. There are many reasons why teachers do not use the computers as a learning resource in their classroom. Some do not favor the use of computers, others do not have the time, and some simply do not have the funding to allow the use of computers as part of their curriculum.  Before we can begin discussing the use of technology in the classroom we must understand how it is integrated. 

==What is technology integration in the classroom?==	
Many people ask the question: What is technology integration and how is it possible?  First, technology integration is not using the computers for twenty minutes one day instead of teaching the history of China. It is using the computers for twenty minutes a day to teach the history of China (Dockstader, 1999). Technology integration is not using computer software for unrelated purposes. According to Dockstrader (1999) technology integration is defined as “using computers effectively and efficiently in the general content areas to allow students to learn how to apply computer skills in meaningful ways” (p. 1). Secondly, technology integration is something that takes time and patience on the behalf of the teachers.  This is where many people begin to disagree about technology integration in the classroom. Let the debate begin!

==Pros of Technology== 
There are numerous benefits for the use of technology in all curricula in today’s education.  Many educators have recognized these benefits and have begun to implement technology as part of their curriculum. Some educators even ask the question: Why not implement technology into the curriculum? Educators want it, parents want it, and employers want it. With our changing society today, it is important to prepare our children with the proper framework and standards to perform in the workplace.  Traditional educational practices can no longer provide students with all the necessary skills (NETSP, 1-2).  

The use of the computers can break up the monotony of lecture and note taking in the classroom. The use of some lecture and note taking is necessary to understand the material. However, teachers can use the computers to enhance their curriculum.  The computer can be used to introduce a new topic, apply it, or review it for a test or quiz. Teachers can use video websites, websites with self-assessments, and other databases filled with information to enrich a student’s education.  Websites that offer self-assessment can serve as a tutor for the teachers.  According to a report entitled Computer Advantages: Tutoring Individuals, “with computers as tutors, no student will be overwhelmed because he or she is missing fundamentals, the computer will repeat material until each lesson has been sufficiently mastered” (as cited in the Journal of Educational Policy).  This can be very beneficial in a classroom, because it allows the students to learn more at their own pace without feeling as if they are being held back or left behind due to the progress of the majority of the class. Technology integration can also make lessons fun and more interesting. 

Teachers can integrate games via SMART Board to engage the students in interactive learning. According to The Virginia Pilot, some Virginia teachers use the SMART Board instead of flash cards or paper because it allows the student to see pictures and pause on information until it is understood (Bower, 1999). 

Technology can be integrated into the curriculum early in a student's school career.  The elementary school in Surry County has implemented a new computer based program called Breakthrough Literacy.  It is a program that helps kindergarten students learn to read using a classroom mascot and the computer. The students must learn about the computer and the different parts of the computer before they start to use it.  Soon they learn how to log in on and log off on their own.  The students use headphones to follow directions through activities to help them begin to learn how to read.  They spend twenty to thirty minutes a day on the computer in the lab working on their reading curriculum.  Booklets and other worksheets are worked on in the classroom that goes with the theme of the week.  Work is also sent home for the students to share with their parents.  Integrating technology early in the school years makes it easier for the later years.

Overall the use of technology in the classroom can offer an abundance of benefits.  It prepares our students with the necessary skills for the workplace, it offers a diverse learning environment, and it makes the learning environment fun and interesting.

30% of what we see,
50% of what we both see and hear,
70% of what we discuss with others,
80% of what we experience personally,
95% of what we teach to someone else.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==Cons of Technology== 
Technology integration seems fun and easy to do. However, is it really that easy to integrate technology into a curriculum? Do all students perform and complete tasks like they are asked to while using the computers?  The answer to both questions is, no.  This is why some people oppose using technology in the classroom. First, it is hard to integrate technology as part of a curriculum if the teacher does not even know how to use all the software on the computer. Second, some educators believe that the students do not have enough basic skills and background information to use the computers. Third, some educators argue that it can interfere with the teacher-student contact. Finally, funding can be an obstacle- some schools simply can not afford to provide computers for all the students or enable them to receive proper training. 

Some teachers have taught for twenty-five plus years and when they began to teach, technology was not an option in their classroom. However, now twenty some years later we as a society expect them to use technology in their classroom. Some of these teachers are not even familiar with computers and all the software available on a computer, but yet we expect them to teach our students to use the computer to learn the material. Some educators fear if they begin to integrate technology in their curriculum they will be embarrassed because the students will know more about the computers than they do. How can we expect teachers to teach our students and maintain the respect in their classroom when the students might be teaching their own teachers about computers?  

Many teachers use the computers for students to do research. However, it is important that the students know some background information when researching on the Internet. “There are four things that need to be looked at to evaluate a site quickly before the resource is further considered: the author of the work, the URL, the currency of the information as well as the actual information that is provided” (Lampkins, 2007). These four things are important for students to know prior to researching on the Internet.  Many educators argue that they have to first explain all this information to the students and then spend the rest of the time monitoring the research to ensure that the students are doing proper research. It would be easier to research in the library where the sources are more trustworthy. 

Another argument against technology use in the classroom is that it could interfere with the teacher-student relationship. They do not want the computers to interfere with the student’s need for human support.  Some argue that if the computer can act as a tutor and solve the problems for the student, then there will be no need for the teacher to interact with the students (Gulley, 2003). The students have emotional needs and the teacher must take into account these needs despite the advances in technology.

Lastly, many schools can not afford to provide computer labs and individual computers in each classroom and continue to upgrade them every few years. This automatically puts these students at a disadvantage because they do not have the resources to be exposed to advanced technology.  The Title 1 schools are just trying to make ends meet.  They do not have the extra money to fund technology projects even if they desired to.  Whereas, charter schools receive grants which allows them to fund project such as upgrading technology.  Obviously there is a clear disadvantage in our educational system that must be worked out. Dr. Dwight Allen and Dr. William Cosby in their book, ''American Schools: The 100 Billion Dollar Challenge'', propose that as a society we make a commitment to allocate the financial resources to provide every child with the proper technology.

==Conclusion==
There are some advantages and disadvantages to integrating technology into the curricula. However, in order to provide our students with the proper education we as a society must agree on what we want them to be accountable for. There are clearly some obstacles that we need to overcome in order to make technology use available for everyone. However, these obstacles can be overcome with staff development for teachers who are not comfortable with the software, training for the students to learn proper Internet use, and funding to provide equal opportunities for all students. The advantages of technology use outweigh the disadvantages.  Technology integration can be seen as a bridge to the gap between traditional education and technological education.

{{question-answer|question=Explain several advantages and disadvantages to the use of technology in the classroom. 
|answer=Some people disagree about the advantages and disadvantages of technology use in the classroom.  However, it is important to know all the arguments before one can make a decision. Thirdly, some educators argue that it can interfere with the teacher-student contact. They believe that if the teachers rely on the computers to serve as tutor then the students will lose that student-teacher contact. Finally, funding, some schools simply cannot afford to provide computers for all the students to enable them to receive proper training. This problem varies from state to state and district to district.

Some of the advantages of technology integration are the skills that it provides our students with for the workplace. Many jobs are requiring that all employees have some basic computer skills and it is beneficial for the students to receive these skills in school. Secondly, it offers a diverse classroom setting. Some lecture and note taking is necessary; however a little change every once in awhile is helpful.  Thirdly, the computers can serve as tutors for the students. They no longer have to feel as if they must keep up with the majority of the class. If a student does not understand a topic the computer can repeat the material as much as needed.  

There are clear advantages and disadvantages to technology use in the classroom. This is a debate that will continue because many teachers have their own personal interest in their classroom. 
----
There are several ways to use technology in the classroom.  People often disagree on technology integration and how effective or useful it is.  There are many advantages to integrating technology into the classroom such as preparing students for the workforce and it presents instruction on a different medium.  Employers are expecting potential employees to know how to use technology and understand it.  If technology is not presented in school, then the student may be unprepared for the workforce.  Technology also helps to enrich as student’s education by teaching through another method instead of only lecture.  Technology can reach visual learners better than lecture and it brings excitement to the lesson.  Another advantage to using technology is students can learn at their pace.  If they are working at a computer on a lesson, they can repeat the lesson as often as needed instead of holding the entire class back.  There are also disadvantages people who are opposed to integrating technology recognize.  The first disadvantage to requiring technology in the classroom is not all teachers are competent when it comes to technology.  Some teachers do not know how to use a computer or may not know how to use the software available to them.  This makes it harder for these teachers to use technology in their classroom.  The same applies to students because the students are also at different levels of technology competency.  Teachers may think students do not have the background or skills to use a computer so why bother?  Two other important issues are the amount of funding a school receives for technology and the teacher-student contact.  There is a shortage of funding for schools that does not enable them to have adequate technology to meet their students’ needs.  The last argument is technology will interfere with teacher-student contact.  People fear the computers will not provide the human support students need.  Although there are disadvantages as well as advantages to using technology in the classroom, it is clear technology is important and will continue to hold a place in the lives of educators, employers and employees.  This is why it is so important students should be educated on how to use technology in the most effective way. &amp;mdash;Shannon Compton

Incorporating computers into the classroom has its advantages and disadvantages.  Some people believe that computers limit a student’s ability to do their assignments properly, however; they can expand their knowledge of the topic.  Computer technology can also help the student to be more creative and analyze information in a wider range than if they did not have new insights on the subject.  They can help students to do job searches when they are ready to graduate or find an apartment upon the dismissal of home life.  Students have the opportunity to learn how to do any basic or advanced living skill to help them survive in the real world.
Even with all of the advantages of computers there are disadvantages.  Teachers are still teaching a curriculum that has been used for years instead of teaching in the present more advanced way using computers to advance the students knowledge.  In other words, teachers are basing all of their teaching on the textbooks instead of using the computer to their advantage. Computers are still being used for the basic, common tasks that have been used for years.   Teachers are afraid that computers will take over their job.  This is one of the prime reasons that technology has not been used properly in the advancement that it should be used for.  
There are advantages and disadvantages, but should we keep our students from learning all that they can learn?  I would hope that teachers, parents and students would want to have every advantage that they can have from life, even if it means jumping a few obstacles. &amp;mdash;Tina Osborne

Using technology in the classroom gives the students practice and preparation for the real world.  Technology is not going anywhere and students today need to start as early as possible to get to know technology.  The more they use it the more acceptive they will be to changes that are always occurring in the technology world.  The use of technology in the classroom can make lessons more interesting and can help keep the students engaged in the lesson.

Yes there can be disadvantages to the use of technology in the classroom.  Students can abuse the computer privileges they are given.  They can visit sites that are not approved for the lesson or for them to visit in the first place.  Computers are not the only technology students can abuse.  They can also abuse the school camera with taking inappropriate pictures.  Teachers can even say that using technology in the classroom can be time consuming.

One must first look at their comfort level with technology before they decide on the use of technology in the classroom.  There are always advantages and disadvantages to everything in life, technology is no different. &amp;mdash;Marilyn Russo
----
There are many advantages and disadvantages of technology integrated in today’s classrooms. Some advantages are computers can break up the amount of lecturing a teacher has to do and how much a student has to listen too. It also helps decrease the amount of note taking a student must do.  The computer can help students understand the information needed by taking practice quizzes or tests from their classroom.  They many also use the internet to research more about the topic they are studying to participate in a class discussion.  Videos from United Streaming and other websites are a great way to enhance the curriculum for the students. They seem to enjoy watching movies because it is less note taking and less interaction they must take place in.  Although, there are many disadvantages to having computers in the classroom too, for example, the teachers of the last generation are unfamiliar with computers and would have to be taught how to use the computer making it harder for the students to learn when the teacher does not even know how to use the computer him or herself.  In addition, it is said that the relationship between the students and the teachers are lost because there is less interaction between them.  The biggest disadvantage though is the cost of integrating computers into the classroom, computers are very expensive and having them in every classroom can get outrageous. Technology is slowing creeping into the classroom; soon every classroom will have at least one computer in their room, despite the advantages and the disadvantages we are in a technology world. &amp;mdash;Jennifer Slaughter

Technology and the internet could be considered a necessary evil.  Technology has its perks.  It definitely is convenient and a time saver.  Teachers no longer have to write their entire lectures on the blackboard for each class.  Thanks to Power Point, they can now present the material with the click of a button.  Along with Power Point, teachers can use online tutorials, quizzes, pictures, and educational pictures to reinforce the lecture.  Technology benefits all learning styles, not just oral and visual learners.  Teachers can’t possibly teach students everything, but they should teach students how to find information.  Thanks to the internet, students have access to researching their questions.  

Technology can benefit students outside the classroom as well.  Many jobs require computer and technological skills.  Even sales clerks, servers, and gas attendants have to use computers and machines to do their jobs.  By exposing children to technology early, it will benefit them in the long run.

On the other hand, technology can make students lazy.  They no longer have to go to the library and use books for research.  They can just type in their topic in a search engine and have thousands of web sites pop up.

Technology like cell phones, iPods, and instant messaging have changed communication and personal relationships.  People don’t even have to call a person and actually have voice contact with them.  They can text message or send an instant message.  Sometimes technology can make life too easy. &amp;mdash;Kim Walsh}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How should the Internet be integrated into the classroom?}}
[[File:Computerkids.jpg|350px|right|border]]

The Internet, as defined by Concept to Classroom, is a collection of computers connected in a worldwide network.  This means that knowledge can be shared quickly and worldwide with just the click of a button.  Does the Internet have a place in the classroom?  Yes!  The Internet is not going anywhere; its power is only increasing.  Teachers need to be able to harness that power and use it to better prepare our children for the “real world”.  By integrating this technology into our classrooms one can only imagine the exposure and information our children will be able to gain.  Also it makes you think where education will go in the future.

==Why Use the Internet?==
The Internet is a great tool for every subject.  It not only answers questions about assigned work but helps children to formulate their own questions and find those answers as well.  It can enhance the impact of a lesson, increase communication, and make presentations easy and fun.  If used properly the Internet can engage today’s learner.  Integrating technology does not mean using it as a reward for good behavior or a babysitter while you grade papers.  [http://www.cln.org/integrating.html Integrating technology] means using it as a means of enhancing the lessons you are already teaching.  It helps students “move beyond knowledge and comprehension to application and analysis of information” (Dockstader 1999).  Today’s learners are fast paced and easily bored; thus, the use of computers helps to keep them focused, engaged, and excited about what they are learning.  Computer skills should be taught in conjunction with core content (Dockstader 1999).  Students acquire many computer skills just by giving them the chance to explore and create through the learning process (Dockstader 1999).   
The teaching profession is changing along with the digital age.  

According to Don Tapscott, there are eight major shifts:
*Shifting from linear to hypermedia learning
*Shifting from instruction to construction and discovery
*Shifting from teacher-centered to learner-centered education
*Shifting from absorbing material to learning how to navigate and how to learn
*Shifting from school to lifelong learning
*Shifting from one-size-fits-all to customized learning
*Shifting from learning as torture to learning as fun
*Shifting from the teacher as transmitter to the teacher as facilitator

These shifts are a huge evolution and teachers need to be better trained to assist this new style of learning (Tapscott 1999).  

===Home Use===
{{Rquote|right|The Internet is just a world passing around notes in a classroom.|Jon Stewart}}

Domine did a study on children who have access to at least one computer, and use it on a regular basis.  She found that students use the Internet at home to look up sport information, chat with friends, download music, watch videos and sometimes to do their homework.  The students she interviewed claimed to be “clueless about computers” or “not to be a computer person”; when really their lives revolved around the computer.  Although at home, they are pulling from their parents for direction and that guides what they do and how they are exposed to the Internet.  These children are digital natives and while they may not be experts on programming they can easily find any information on any topic they are looking for(Domine 2006).

===School Use===
{{Rquote|right|Advances in computer technology and the Internet have changed the way America works, learns, and communicates.  The Internet has become an integral part of America's economic, political, and social life.|Bill Clinton}}

If students are getting exposure to the Internet at home, why integrate it into the classroom?  The job of the teacher in a classroom is evolving with technology.  It is our job as teachers to guide children to the “good” information on the Internet and teach them how to discern credible information from non-credible information.  Kids themselves realize what a good tool it is, “…the perfect tool for education”, says Junior from Domine’s study.  It is also the job of the teacher to connect how the children use the Internet at home to how they use it at school.  When used properly it can play an important position in making the curriculum come alive to all students (Domine 2006).

==Benefits of Technology Integration==
{{Rquote|right|We have technology, finally, that for the first time in human history allows people to really maintain rich connections with much larger numbers of people.|Pierre Omidyar}}

Using the Internet in the classroom has an infinite number of benefits.  The four main areas in which the Internet is useful in the classroom are communication and collaboration, research, data collection, and web publishing (NTTI 2006).  Students can have access to peers around the world, experts in any field, and information on any topic.  When using real-time Internet, students can really see the connection between what they are studying and the real world applications (NTTI 2006).  Web publishing is advanced for most teachers but when children get a chance to display their work to the world, they put more effort into what they are learning and are more enthusiastic about projects, as their efforts will show (NTTI 2006).  

The Internet expands the up to date resources available to every child.  It also gives meaning and depth to what the children are learning from their texts.  It can also reduce time and location dependency (Concept to Classroom 2004).  For example, if you are teaching a lesson on archeology, after learning background information, students can go to the Internet and participate on a dig or talk with a real archeologist.  It helps to bring printed information to life!  Schools are dynamic, ever changing places and the Internet is a great tool but as always in teaching, it is up to the teacher to decide what is the best resource to use for any given lesson (Concept to Classroom 2004). 

==Disadvantages of Technology Integration==
One big disadvantage that schools are faced with is cost.  Surprise! Technology isn’t cheap!   In addition to just buying the computers/laptops, schools need chairs that prevent back injury, they need wireless connections in every classroom, and they need ways to protect the expensive equipment they buy (Kennedy 2007).  Schools are already complaining about tight budgets and now we are asking them to contribute thousands or millions of dollars to bring our schools into the high tech world.  Will that money take away from buying updated textbooks?

Another worry is that Internet in schools will distract or replace teaching basic skills(Concept to Classroom 2004).  This worry can be lessened by having productive training and in-services for teachers who are already in the classroom and good basic instruction for those studying to go into today’s classrooms.  Again the Internet should not replace any instruction only add to its value. 
 
Another concern is access to inappropriate and distracting information.  We now have fairly strong filtering systems in place to prevent most access to information such as pornography or online (non-educational) games.  Also most schools have an Acceptable Use Policy that outlines the rules for appropriate use and consequences for using the Internet inappropriately (Concept to Classroom 2004).

A big concern of teachers is that they don’t have the time or resources to facilitate productive use of the Internet.  The school days are already jam-packed and we are asking them to update their plans to include technology they don’t know how to use (Norm L. 2005).  And what happens when the technology isn’t reliable??  More support staff and in-services are required to make the most of what tools we have…but again up creeps the money issue.

==Best Practices and Helpful Hints==
The goal is to integrate technology so that it is adding to our educational value.  The skills we are teaching must relate to the content area, the classroom, and they need to be assisting the traditional method of instruction (Dockstader 1999).  Teachers need to be comfortable with the media before giving access to the students.  Here are seven steps that the Jerome School District used when trying to integrate technology:
*Choose a core area (just one to start)
*Decide what technology skill you want to teach or could be taught in this area
*Choose one lesson that could be enhanced or taught through the computer (start easy!)
**[http://courseweb.unt.edu/rhondac/classrm.html Try one of these sites!]
*Develop that one lesson in a software package you know very well
*Use it!
*Evaluate how it went, what needs to change for next time
*Refine the lesson and repeat the process with another lesson or core area (Dockstader 1999).

There are so many websites available to teachers for technological support.  Use them!!  If you have a problem don’t be afraid to ask for help.  Use your colleagues as a resource.   Most school systems have at least one technology support staff to assist you in learning a new program or executing a new, improved lesson!  We, as teachers, need to model that we don’t know everything but we know how to find the answers or help when needed.

==Conclusion==
As far as technology in our schools is concerned we have come a long way.  However, there is still a long way yet to go.  We need better-trained teachers who appreciate what an amazing resource the Internet can be in a classroom.  We need the money to help all schools have the same opportunities.  Most importantly, we, as teachers, need patience and the desire to grow and evolve with the path of education.

{{question-answer|question=As a future teacher, how would you plan to incorporate technology and the Internet into your curriculum?
|answer=I plan to have a classroom where the environment is stimulating and exciting.  I want to keep children engaged with the material I have to teach them.  I plan to incorporate new technologies where ever and whenever I can.  I will use it to reinforce the standards of learning set out before me.  I want the children to cultivate a love of learning and be able to teach them how to distinguish good material from bad material.  As they grow and mature this is going to be an extremely important proficiency to have.  There are also tons of teacher resources on the Internet that I plan to take advantage of.  There are websites that you can type the material that you are teaching and it gives you a specific worksheet to emphasize those topics.  These websites and magazines include Ed-Helper, Mailbox, and Teacher’s Helper.  I plan to continue to be a learner throughout my career because I am very excited to learn all the new ways to teach today's children.  It is always important to stay at the forefront of your career path in order to make the most of what you do, ESPECIALLY when children are involved.  I am truly excited to get into a classroom and experience/try out these theories on education and technology.

As a future teacher, I plan to use technology as often as possible in my classroom. I want my classroom to be interactive so that the students will always be interested in what they are learning. In order to make my classroom interactive I hope to use SMART BOARDS and PowerPoint presentations in my classroom. I hope to be able to use a SMART BOARD to create interactive games that I can play with my students to help them better understand subjects that we are learning in class. I also plan to use PowerPoint presentation to present lessons and information that the students need to learn. Standing in front of the class and writing on a white board would probably bore the students so I plan to find ways, like using PowerPoint, to keep them interested.  I also plan to use the internet at every opportunity that I have. I plan to have lesson that will require the students to use the Internet to search for information or to play games that will reiterate and review what we are learning or have learned in class. The Internet will only be used in my classroom for educational purposes. It will not be used as a way just to keep the students busy or to simply give them something to do. Technology is already and will continue to revolutionize and change the classroom. I plan to keep up with the changing technology and use it to the best advantage of both me and my students. &amp;mdash;Charlis Harvey
----
Technology in the classroom has many purposes.  One purpose of technology in the classroom is to provide students with a different way to learn.  An interactive way of studying the same subjects.  I plan to use the internet to allow my students to take virtual field trips and as a way of researching for projects and assignments.  Not only will this be a different, interactive approach, it will also help students with their computer skills, which will be vital to their success in the future job market.  Using computer based testing and reading programs will provide students with another alternative to pencil and paper based testing and maybe lessen test anxiety since they aren't trying to finish the paper test faster than their peers.  I also plan to utilize some resources that I have found on the web that can be tailored to power point lessons, and even Jeopardy games for different learning modules.  I recently created a Jeopardy game for second grade social studies and then asked my second grader to play with me.  I wanted to judge his response to learning the material in a different manner and was pleasantly surprised to see his excitement at this activity.  I think that the use of PowerPoints, and even short video clips can greatly enhance students educational experience and I plan to integrate it into my lesson plans as much as possible.  As a substitute teacher, I have been exposed to many different teaching styles and many different tools.  I think that technology integration, used in the proper manner, with the proper safeguards can only enhance the futures of students. &amp;mdash;Tammy Bartlett

Let’s face it: students today have grown in a world full of technology. Most children spend their leisure time on the computer, their mp3 player, or on some other type of technology device. So for the most part I think it is safe to say that children enjoy the digital world they are in. Teachers need to meet in the middle and incorporate some of these technology advances within their classroom to grab the attention of their students.

There are many inventive and creative ways to incorporate technology. Some may include using blogs, the internet, podcast, and smart boards. Teachers can educate and guide students to use these forms of technology in an more educational way. For instance; teachers and students can use blogging in the classroom. Blogging can be used like a discussion board. The teacher can post an article on a blog then the class can discuss and evaluate the article online. The internet can be used more for more then researching a topic. There are tons of educational games out there that can fit into the school’s curriculum. Using the form of a game allows the students to learn while having fun. Podcast could be very beneficial for homebound and sick students. If the student missed a class they would have the lecture to listen. Another thing that could be very beneficial in the classroom is a smart board. This tool allows students to learn more hands on. 

There are many forms of technology that can be incorporated within the classroom. The main thing is for teachers to take advantages of these resources. If students do not then they could be disabling students of this age to learn at the best of their capabilities. &amp;mdash;Krystal Bell}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|Can teachers be replaced by computers?}}

Education is not replacing the human teacher, but rather replacing the location of that teacher.  Rather than having a teacher stand in front of you in a traditional classroom setting, students will have access to their teachers and lessons through computers. With the rise of continuing education and distance learning programs offered at community, public, and private colleges, the idea of having these same programs to benefit students in elementary and secondary education is now here. Technology today is going to make school easier for the teachers and the students. The No Child Left Behind Act is using virtual school to help students that are unable to transfer to high performance schools due to overcrowding or lack of transportation, an option of online learning.  It will also bring relief to students because they will not be limited to the information in their classroom, but have the option of going beyond what they have learned in the classroom and receive credit for it from their home school. So what does this say for our aspiring and veteran teachers?  Take as many computer courses as you can because it will greatly benefit you and your students.

==How does this work?==
Well, for starters, instead of having a teacher standing in front of a chalkboard or beside an overhead projector writing down the class work and homework for the day, students will access their lessons by a computer or watch their instructor televised live from another location.  “In February 2004, the U.S. Department of Education issued guidance specifically defining virtual schools as a legally acceptable way to create additional capacity for students wishing to transfer… as long as the virtual school is a public elementary or secondary school and has not been identified for school improvement, corrective action, or restructuring.” (B.S. Hassel, M Terrell 2004).  The NCLB Act has three options for students.  The first option is an off-site virtual school where students will access their lessons, homework, etc from the site of their choosing.  The second option is a “school- within a school where students will eat lunch with peers, have music and art classes, etc. but the core academic instruction would be provided online in a different room or structure located on the school site” (B.S. Hassel, M Terrell 2004).  The third option is an “offsite facility in conjunction with a nonprofit organization, such as a community center.  A teacher or administrator would be onsite to help monitor students; however, most instruction would be online” (B.S. Hassel, M Terrell 2004).  With the growing number of virtual schools, teachers are not being replaced in fact; they are in high demand for highly qualified teachers.

==Virtual Dissection vs. the Lab==
Dissections have been done in schools for many years. They provide a way for students to learn about the internal and external anatomical structures of animals. By taking a hands-on learning approach, students can get a real sense of the relationships between the structures of organisms.

There are some students who are disturbed by dissection. Online (virtual) dissections provide the means to experience actual dissections without the mess. There are online video dissections where the student just watches the video of a dissection, and there are other virtual dissections that provide the student visual images and step-by-step instructions on how to conduct their own dissection. Other online dissections provide diagrams and pictures that display certain anatomical structures (firstmonday.org).

Traditional dissections, done in traditional classrooms, are a very social activity. Students generally work together in groups during dissections. Doing dissections in groups means that the students must learn how to work collaboratively. This requires a degree of teamwork allowing students to share in the responsibility of conducting a dissection. Students working in groups in the traditional lab are often encouraged to examine the other specimens in the class to observe the differences in sex, differences in muscle tissue, organs in different places and so much more. There are considerable differences in the social atmosphere between physical and virtual dissections.         

There are many differences between actual and virtual dissection. For instance, when students take part in a virtual dissection there is usually 
no teamwork involved. Virtual dissections usually focus on the student – computer interaction rather than the human to human interaction.   Virtual dissections provide an alternative exercise for students as well as provide review material for students prior to test.                      

Although dissection simulations may provide the capability of examining both male and female specimens, at least for study of the reproductive system, they do not typically allow users to explore other types of variation. Virtual dissections replace everything including the specimen, the textbooks, dissection manual, and maybe even the teacher. In contrast to a real frog, the virtual frog can be taken apart in any sequence. The student can start with the digestive system and then put back together again.  This new “digital” frog requires no scalpels, probes or offensive smelling gases. It just requires a computer. The three-dimensional simulation is a valuable tool in the teaching of basic anatomy and physiology. The “digital” frog can also be rotated and viewed from any angle. These virtual alternatives to dissection are less expensive than the real thing because software and three-dimensional models, unlike the animals, are a reusable resource.

There has always been a controversy over the dissection of animals.  There are some students who are refusing to dissect for humanitarian reasons.  Some say they will not participate in dissection due to their religious beliefs. At least eight states now have policies allowing students to opt out of dissection, according to the Humane Society of the United States. They include Florida, California, Illinois, Louisiana, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Maine.  Such policies, in the form of state law, allow students to learn anatomy and physiology by other means, without a penalty. In a recent survey of 5,000 biology teachers conducted by the Humane Society of the United States, two-thirds of those polled indicated they support student choice on the issue of dissection (lists.envirolink.org).Virtual dissection may be the best alternative for these students who find it offensive, uncomfortable or too disturbing.

Over the past decade, interactive software and online simulations have made it possible to study the inner workings of animals without actually cutting them up. These virtual dissections are cleaner than the actual in lab dissections and require less materials, tools, textbooks and time. Changing the classroom from one where students dissect with a scalpel to one where students dissect with a computer mouse requires nothing more than an available computer, a CD-ROM or downloadable software, and, of course, the computer mouse itself. What it offers, however, is the promise of an exciting, innovative, and stimulating educational experience. 

Students using virtual dissection programs can still work together in groups. They can take turns clicking on different parts of the anatomy and can share in reading the corresponding text to learn about each of these parts and their functions. Studies show that students learning frog anatomy just by using the virtual dissection programs did just as well, if not better, on their exams in comparison to their peers who learned frog anatomy by doing actual physical dissections.

There is a wonderful Museum in Newport News, Va. that has a Virtual Frog dissection station where visitors can learn about the anatomy of a frog via a touch screen computer. Children are fascinated by this.They are thrilled to learn about the inner workings of a frog via this computer program. When a student experiences the actual in-lab dissections, they smell the formaldehyde, and possibly get an animal’s insides squirt all over them when they use the scalpel. For some students it may not always be a pleasant class in high school, nor might it be any better in college. Nonetheless, it is something that the student will never forget. The whole experience of actually learning in the lab will stay with the student  for years to come. 

Virtual dissection should not be the sole method of learning about the anatomy of an animal, however it is an effective supplement to it. The whole experience of working together with your classmates, the pungent smell that hits you when you carefully peel back the wrapping on the specimen and the squirmy feeling of touching and consequently cutting through an organ is valuable. Using both methods in conjunction would prove beneficial to the student and would most definitely enhance their learning experience.

==More Teachers?==
Virtual schools are actually in need of highly qualified teachers.  Aspiring and veteran teachers that want to become an online instructor must complete “an approved professional development curriculum ensuring their competency as online instructors. They should demonstrate design and implementation knowledge necessary to deliver quality instruction to students in the new school. Also, personnel policies need administrators of virtual schools to have a specific skill set and professional development training which includes; leading a teaching staff that may itself be completely virtual” (B.S. Hassel, M Terrell 2004).  Retired teachers’ can also become online instructors because they will not have to move to another county or state to do their job.  However, teachers are going to be required to complete extensive computer training if they have not already done so, to become highly qualified teachers for virtual schools.  

==Teacher/Student Communication==
There are many communication devices that are used for virtual schools such as discussion boards, e-mails, online presentations, microphones at off-site facilities and more. Yet, one thing that virtual schools cannot replace is the one-on-one attention given in the traditional classrooms.  This type of interaction helps students to understand their teacher’s personality and teaching styles as well for the teacher to observe their students in the classroom and understand their personality and learning styles.  

==Conclusion==

As you can see, there is no need to panic.  Students will still interact with their teachers, just not in a traditional setting.  The NCLB Act has even set guidelines to ensure that schools meet specific requirements in order to host virtual schools.   Since there are a growing number of virtual schools, more teachers are in demand as online instructors. Aspiring and veteran teachers must be highly qualified to become an online instructor by going through extensive computer training to show competency in online education. Although there are many communication devices, it will never take the place of one-on-one attention that is in a traditional class setting.

{{question-answer|question=Communication between virtual teachers and students are not as personal as traditional class settings.  Would posting an online learning style assessment be beneficial to all students? What can teachers do to understand their virtual students learning styles?
|answer=There are different ways to communicate to the students to find out there learning styles.  Teachers can obtain a class roster and send a letter or an email to each of the students asking them to tell them a little bit about them selves and their learning style.  Just placing an online assessment about learning styles will not be completely beneficial to students because online assessments may not include all of the details in the questions to help understand the students. Another suggestion would be to have students meet at a site and have live televised interaction between the students and the instructor.  By having all the students meet at a site, they could develop a student support group. You may find that some students may speak different languages and may need their assignments translated into their language.  Most bilingual students would like to choose which language they want to work with. Not all students that have just begun taking virtual classes may be able to buy computers or update their hardware or software right away.  Just by using, a simple means of communication shows the students that the teacher cares about the students and if they pass or fail there class.

Virtual classrooms are an attractive alternative to in-class lecture sessions. Virtual classes are becoming more and more popular with students all over the world. Virtual classes are so convenient. Though it is true that virtual classes do not offer the personal aspect of getting to know one's teacher, peers, or students there are still a few options available to us when it comes to getting to know one another. For instance, an instructor/teacher could offer online assessments through which students could respond to various questions. They could allow for a portion of that assessment to be in an essay format where the students could write freely about themselves and their learning styles, likes , dislikes, etc. Another alternative to that which I have found to be beneficial to me is the web-conference. There are online web-conferencing programs that students can download through which they can communicate with their instructors/teachers at a set time. Some web-conference programs are video enabled so that the students and teachers can actually see each other during the conference.  They also offer sound where the instructors and students communicate through their built in microphones in their computers. If students don't have that capability, they can type in there responses to questions or can contribute to the discussion taking place. It is amazing at what can be done now thanks to technology. Even though we may not be physically in the classroom with the instructor there are still opportunities to make our virtual experience a more personal one. We can literally bridge the distance gap between teachers and their students. For a student that is traveling during a virtual class, web conferencing can make the difference in being counted absent or present. There are some classes that are considered hybrid classes which mean that they may be virtual but also offer in class (on campus) sessions and offer the web conferencing option. All of these options make it so much easier to be a part of the class. As technology develops it is certain that there will be new innovations when it comes to virtual classes. &amp;mdash;M.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|Should students have the ability to use computers in the classroom?}}

Should students have the ability to use computers in the classroom?  Should computer use in the classroom be a part of the educational day?  How should computers be used in the classroom?  These are all questions that are bounced around among teachers, staff and parents.  Let’s look into the use of computers in the classroom by students.

==Students Should Be Allowed To Use Computers in the Classroom==
Teachers allowing students to use the computers in the classroom often becomes a big issue in schools.  Younger, newer teachers want to expose students to computers as much as possible because that is what awaits them after graduation.  Kathryn Tighe, a third grade teacher at Surry Elementary School states that, “Computers are a good thing for students to use in the classroom.”  Older teachers often feel that students’ minds are being drained of potential knowledge if they sit in front of a computer.  This way of thinking is due to the lack of staff development in the area of technology.  

When should students be allowed to use the computers in the classroom?  Different views are given to when and why students should use the classroom computer.  The technology director will want the students using the computers so the department will continue to receive funding for more technology.  Teachers want the computers to be used for reasons ranging from a babysitter to preparation for the real world.  Administrators want the computers being used because they often feel that technology helps boost these wonderful Standards of Learning Test (SOL) scores.  Students want to use the computers because it is fun as well as educational.  

Why should students be allowed to use the computers in the classroom?  All reasons stated previously are valid reasons to allow students to use classroom computers except for as a babysitter.  The computers in the classroom are wonderful tools to enhance a lesson and the students’ knowledge of the computer world.  There are many reasons for using computers in the classroom.  Computer use can “increase basic skills in math, reading and writing” (Sadker) as well as other content areas.  Sadker list other useful purposes of computer use in the classroom to include student motivation, the promotion of higher order thinking, increasing the use of academic resources, reaching different learning styles, and preparing students for the workplace.  Computer use in the classroom by students enhances the ability to teach problem based learning.  The computer can help a teacher “guide students in real-world problem solving” (Sadker) and still cover the curriculum for No Child Left Behind.

==Computer Use: Part of the Educational Day==           
Many teachers love implementing computer usage into their lesson plans and then there are teachers who dread the thought of the students needing to get on the computer.  Computer use can be a very vital part of the educational day for the teacher and students.  Computers can help engage students in the lesson that is being taught.  Computers can often be incorporated into any lesson and students like the change of pace (Tighe).   Using computers as part of their educational day, students can become engaged in “problem solving” (McKenzie).  Cooperative learning can also become a productive outcome by use of the computer when working on a class project.  Children like to use computers in groups which encourages cooperative learning.

Middle school and high school students across Virginia are now taking their Standards of Learning Tests on computers.  Preparing students to use the computer is an important part of their education since it is now becoming an increasing part of their vital testing sessions.  Students like taking the VA SOLs online versus pencil and paper.  “I don’t get so confused with a bubble sheet when I take my SOL online,” claims a fifth grader at Luther Porter Jackson Middle School.  The student also likes the highlighting marker and calculator that can be used on the computer during the SOL tests.  “I really like it when we get to use the laptops instead of the computer lab,” the student states.

==How Computers Should Be Used In the Classroom==
Many teachers use computers in the classroom in many different ways. What is the most beneficial use of computers for the students?  Using computers as a babysitter is not helping students prepare themselves for the technological world that they will one day enter.  The younger the students are when they begin to properly use the computer to benefit their education the better off they will be when they no longer have their teacher’s hand to hold.

The kindergarten students in an elementary school in Surry County have started a new program this year that requires the students to use the computer on a daily basis.  The program is designed to help students begin to read.  Before the students can use the program they must learn the different parts of the computer and how to use it properly.  Some people my claim that this age is too young to understand how to use a computer, but there are preschool systems that start children at a much younger age.  This program also helps the teacher work with twenty or more children that are all working at different paces.  The teacher is able to give more attention to those who need more help without holding back those that can move on.

==Ways To Use The Computer In The Classroom==
The computer can be used for many different things in a classroom.  It can be used for educational and learning purposes or it can be used to play games and explore the World Wide Web.  The computer is not just a teaching tool for the teacher, but it is a learning tool that students can use as well.  The most common applications used on a computer are usually a word processing program or the internet.  Some teachers may even teach by presenting a PowerPoint presentation.  The Florida Center for Instructional Technology lists the following ways in which computers can be used in your classroom: presentation tools, learning centers, development stations, or a combination of configurations.  The Center also says that computers with internet access allow students and teachers to search for answers to questions immediately.  Computers can be used in project-based activities if there are not enough computers for individual projects.  Teachers can also schedule times when students can do individual work on the computers.  Teachers should explore the different ways to incorporate computers into their daily lessons.  

'''Rules for Caring for Your Computer'''
* No food or drinks near a computer 
* Press, don't pound on keys or mouse buttons 
* Keep fingers away from monitor (Keep screen clean) 
* Unplug modem and computer during thunderstorm
* Use computer only with clean hands 
* Do not install new programs without proper training or approval from network administrator 
* Do not delete files without permission 
* Do not plug or unplug cables without approval or proper training 
* Do not attempt to move a computer without adult assistance 
* Comply with copyright legislation 
* Follow acceptable use rules of your school 
* Load floppies and CDs in the proper manner 
* Do not touch media surface of CDs and floppies
* Do not turn a computer on or off without permission [http://www.lethsd.ab.ca/mmh/technology/grade1tech/takingcare.htm]

==Students Should Be Taught How To Use The Computer==
If a teacher chooses to allow her students to use a computer in the classroom, there are some basic rules students should be taught when using the computer and the internet.  First, the teacher should go over the school’s computer use policy as it relates to students.  The teacher should also explain the proper care of a computer.  The sidebar titled “Rules for Caring for Your Computer” lists some typical rules to present to students about the care of a computer.  They must know that a computer is not something to play with or a toy.  Before any type of activity is started, the teacher should give a brief lesson on how to use the computer and the appropriate applications that will be used in the activity or lesson.  A study conducted by the National Center for Educational Statistics titled “Computer and Internet Use by Students in 2003” showed that 91% of children surveyed between the ages of 5 and 17 used computers in 2003 and only 62% of the same children used the internet.  This shows that although most children have been around a computer at some point, they may not know how to use the computer or the applications on the computer, especially the internet.  Teachers should make sure all students are at the same level when using a particular program or feature that some may not be familiar with.  One important feature to instruct students on how to use properly is the internet.  Students must comply with the school policy on using the internet as well as viewing age appropriate and content related material.  The best way to use the internet is for students to only view websites that has prior approval from the teacher.  Since teachers cannot be at several computers at the same time, students should be taught ways to evaluate websites independently.  Kathy Schrock provides many evaluation surveys and resources on ways to evaluate a website at [http://school.discovery.com/schrockguide/eval.html Critical Evaluation Information].  

==Conclusion==
There will always be teachers that do not like technology but there is a growing number of teachers entering education who embrace technology and what it has to offer their students.  Computer use in the classroom by students can not be based on personal preference.  Teachers should not keep their students from working with computers just because they do not like them and do not want to learn more about them.  The teachers and the school system must put the education of the students first and realize that it is a necessary part of the curriculum.  Technology will only increase and students need to be prepared for it.  The younger the supervised use in the classroom is started the better adapted the students will become as technology is an ever changing world of its own.

{{question-answer|question=How would you use your classroom computers in your students' daily activities?
|answer=I would use my classroom computers in different ways for my students during daily activities.  In the morning and during Drop Everything And Read (D.E.A.R) I would encourage my students to read a book and take Accelerated Reading (AR) tests on the computer.  Depending of the lesson of the day the computer might be incorporated into the lesson plan.  The students need to know how to use the computer in all its varying ways and I want to be the one to help.  Hopefully their curiosity about the many wonders of the computer will encourage them to explore it in more depth during their free time.  Supervised games would be allowed only during free time and as a reward for a productive day.

Computers are of extreme importance to today’s generation. Most people use computers every day for work, school, and/or play. It is important for children to learn how to use computers so that they will be prepared for their future. Almost any job a student will consider uses a computer of some sort.  The learning should begin at a young age. I feel it is important to integrate computers into the education of students. There are many computer programs that can enhance the learning of students. 

I would like to provide time at least once a week where students are able to do a computer activity. These activities would enhance what I have been teaching this week. There are many important skills that can be learned using a computer. I believe one of the most important things I would like to teach my students is how to evaluate online sources. I think it is important for teachers to teach their student’s these skills and then give them a project evaluating sources that they find online. 

I also believe that children should be given free time on computers as a privilege. There are many educational games that children enjoy playing that can help them with math, science, reading, etc. I would like to provide time to my students to be able to play these games. There are many ways that computers can be integrated into a child’s learning. It is important to use technology as it’s role in our every day life continues to grow. &amp;mdash;Britney Kirby

There are numerous ways to use the computers in daily activities for students. As a current high school Spanish teacher, I have thought of several ways that it would be beneficial for my students to use the computers while practicing Spanish. 

One of the most effective activities that I have found on the Internet for my students is the self-paced quizzes. These quizzes give my students the chance to work at their own pace and see immediately their mistakes. My classroom only has about five or six computers; therefore making it difficult for all students to use the computers at once. I try to plan two or three separate activities for my students to do and we rotate them. I assign one group the computer self-pace quizzes, another a written assignment, and another an oral assignment. All three activities are covering the same material but in a different way. This is how I keep my students interested because they rotate from group to group and have a chance to experience all activities. 

Another effective way for students to use the computers is to have them complete group projects that require the use of the computer. Normally, I assign my students to groups and then assign them a project to complete together. I always allow room for the students to be creative; most students will get involved in a project especially on the computer if they know they can add there own personal touch to it. As for all my projects there are certain activities that they must complete on the computer so that I know their basic computer skills. 

Finally, I let my students use the computers to practice their listening skills. I believe that in order for them to understand Spanish they need to hear it from someone besides myself. I assign each student to a specific day of the week and that day they are allowed to get on the computer and search for a website or go to a site that I have assigned and complete a listening activity. 

In conclusion, there are various ways that you as a teacher can use the computers in your daily activities. A lot of what you do and allow the students to do depends on their grade level and the subject. In teaching Spanish, I have found that I have to be creative in order to plan activities that will be beneficial and interesting for my students. &amp;mdash;Amanda Esparza}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What technology should a teacher use in the classroom?}}

In today’s society, there is a growing need for technology in the classroom. Some teachers are at the cutting edge of incorporating new technology into their daily lesson plans. Also, since there is so much technology out there, what should teachers be using in the classroom? Let’s take a look at some of the more recent technology that is being used in today’s modern classroom.

==Basic Programs==
Before a teacher can use recent technology effectively however, he needs to be able to use basic computer programs to enhance his teaching.  One basic program with a number of applications is power point.  According to Jamye Swinford in an ''Education World'' article on technology, power point can be used for many more things than just presentations.  For example, one could make a Jeopardy style game to do a review.  Excel is another program that can have huge benefits in the classroom.  You can use it to collect data for science experiments.  You can then make graphs and charts out of the data which you can teach students to interpret.  Perhaps the most basic computer program is a word processing program which can be used in a nearly infinite number of ways, from simply typing up handouts for the class to anything you can think of.  You could use it to have students create a newspaper from a time period they are studying.  Or, more traditionally to write papers.  You can have your students create fliers about a cause they are arguing to learn to use other media to persuade.  Depending on the age and ability level of your students basic computer applications can be used to do almost anything to enhance the learning experience.

==LiveText==
LiveText is a new emerging technology that allows students to create electronic portfolios online. The students will then share their projects with their teachers via LiveText. By sharing the documents with the teachers, it gives the opportunity for the teachers to assess the project without turning in a paper copy. By turning in projects online, this allows students to build an electronic portfolio which will give them the opportunity to look back and reflect upon their previous assignments. Live text provides three things for students: (1) demonstrate learning competencies, (2) display competencies, (3) a maintenance tool to document ongoing development (Banister et. al, 2006). Another important tool that LiveText comes with is unlimited storage space. Students can then upload as many documents as they need to the electronic database where they will be stored for as long as they are needed. For teachers, there is a template already built into LiveText for lesson plans. This will cut down the time that is needed to setup a lesson plan, which will allow more time to spend on other projects and grading assignments. There is, however, a downside to LiveText. Students must purchase a one time only subscription code that will give them unlimited access to the online software.

LiveText was originally designed to provide a secure, structured storage in cyberspace for use by elementary school students' work products.  The idea was to show that students could understand and use technology.  Founded in 1997, by undergraduate students at Illinois State University Department of Computer Science, LiveText was developed in the early days of the world wide web.  The founders worked with professors under a grant from the Sloan Foundation to develop and deliver the first generation of web based classes.(Illinois State University)  

LiveText is priced at eighty-nine dollars for a student addition that is valid until one year after you graduate your program.  This seems a fair price considering the price of textbooks.  Also, you can renew your subscription on a yearly basis after that.  You also have the capability of allowing a visitor to view your files by giving them a password.  With the password, your guest simply logs into LiveText using the password and can then review your files.  This could be a very valuable tool for submitting your portfolio to prospective employers upon graduation. 

==Blackboard==	
Anyone in college has had at least some interaction with Blackboard. For students in high school, there is almost none. In my own high school experience, I had no idea what Blackboard was. I thought that Blackboard was what teachers write on in the classroom! This needs to change. We need to begin to expose students to Blackboard at a much younger age so that they can become familiar with it. Blackboard can be an effective tool when teaching. Students can basically “drop off” their assignments into the respective link. Also, students can take quizzes, post on discussion boards, and have active chats with their teacher and other students. By having all of this available online, the students have virtually unlimited access to their teachers and course materials. Blackboard also makes things a little easier on teachers. With online quizzes and assignments, they are automatically graded by the software and are posted in an online grade book. Instead of grading, teachers can now spend more time developing lesson plans, and devoting more of their time to their students. There is exciting news in Blackboard technology. Blackboard has just released a version designed specifically for students in K-12 schools. There are some advantages for this newer version, it “enables school districts to: 

* Easily provide classroom materials online with students (without having to know HTML)
* Engage parents by allowing them to view student progress
* Enable 24/7 access to learning materials in a secure environment
* Offer innovative testing methods and self-assessments for individualized learning paths” (2006).

These things maybe great for teachers, students and parents but what does it all mean? It means that Blackboard is an effective tool that can be utilized by everyone being affected by the education process. 

==Inspiration==	
There is another effective tool in the modern repertoire of teachers. Inspiration software is more of a study tool than it is anything else. Inspiration software “is a tool that helps organize thoughts--for teachers as well as for students” (Kurtz, 2003). Basically, Inspiration consists of bubble-maps that are created by the students or class as a whole. The teacher can then print out copies of the bubble-map for the whole class for use as study material. For quick brainstorming, rapid fire tool allows for ideas to get put down in writing quickly (Kurtz, 2003). Also, “the new version of Inspiration comes with more than 50 templates for use in language arts, social studies, and science” (Kurtz, 2003). By having plenty of templates to choose from, students and teachers both have the ability to generate ideas and plug them in to the blank areas on the template. The software “is wonderful for students who have a difficult time organizing their writing and research” (Kurtz, 2003). Inspiration software can be used by every area of teaching including special education, “with the added audio component that allows text to be read aloud, this program meets the needs of students within a broader developmental range” (Kurtz, 2003). Inspiration software is an important tool that can be utilized by any student or teacher for creating in class study materials. By using this interactive software, students can improve their grades significantly because they are actually participating in the learning process.

==Unitedstreaming==	
Unitedstreaming is a emerging technology that has impacted my life in a great way and it has influenced my own way of looking at teaching with technology. Unitedstreaming is an online service available to most schools that has thousands of videos, pictures, and songs that are all standards based, which means that all of the videos meet or exceed the Standards of Learning. Through Unitedstreaming, “teachers are learning to prepare lesson plans and student activities in print, graphic, sound and video formats to give teachers and students multiple paths for understanding and retaining content” (Reed, 2003). The videos on Unitedstreaming can be picked and then edited through Windows Movie Maker.

As a student using Unitedstreaming, it is easy to use, extremely addicting and most importantly, fun to use. Searching for videos on there can be a task but it is quite an experience once you have found the perfect one. After you find the videos, you can then edit them to make one continuous clip. This is a great idea for teachers who want to make a video about their subject matter. Also, it would be a great student activity/project for them to generate and get their hands dirty doing something creative. There are however some downsides to using Unitedstreaming in school. Streaming the videos takes up massive amounts of bandwidth and essentially locks up the school's Internet system. So just remember, it is always better to download your videos!

==TeacherTube==
One of the newest technologies to emerge in the past year is TeacherTube, an online database of instructional videos.  Modeled after the popular video website, YouTube, TeacherTube allows educators to “upload, tag, and share videos worldwide.”   These videos range in subject from those instructing teachers how to use new classroom software or how to teach a certain type of lesson to movies that can actually be used in the classroom to help elaborate upon the subject matter.   Not only can educators find videos to supplement their lessons, but those who upload their videos often include access to lesson plans, notes, and activities.  The fact that this website is fully interactive means other educators and even students can comment on the videos and information and provide constructive criticism, leading to the material on the site constantly being upgraded and improved.  This also helps to keep inappropriate videos at bay, by allowing users to flag ones they do not find suitable.  Though new, TeacherTube contains a plethora of information for educators new and old.

==Conclusion==	
There are so many new and emerging technologies in the teaching field that it makes it very easy to become overwhelmed with the deluge of information. There is a great quote about teaching that comes from the Chinese philosopher Confucius. He said. “Acquire new knowledge whilst thinking over the old, and you may become a teacher of others” (2000). There is a lot we can take away from this quote and actually apply it to the subject matter that I have been discussing. What Confucius is saying is that you must learn the new ways while retaining the old, then and only then, will you be a teacher.

==Essay Question==

{{question-answer|question=How would you use technology in your classroom?
|answer=I would use technology at least once a day in my classroom. Students would do projects where they would create and edit their own informative videos based on the topic that they have chosen. They will then take their videos and upload them into LiveText where they can share the videos with the whole class. They would also share the videos with me and I could grade them on it and then post the grades into Blackboard where their parents can see a continual chart of their child’s progress. I really think the idea of creating videos and sharing them with the class is a excellent idea because then it allows other students to see the interests of others in their own social network. Also, the idea of posting the grades in Blackboard and allowing their parents to see the grades as they progress throughout the semester is an important tool to keeping the parents involved in their child’s lives. The Inspiration software is also an important tool that I would utilize because it allows students and teachers to interact to create their own study guide for quizzes and tests. By creating their own study guides, students are more than likely to retain the information that they put in it.
----
I would use technology frequently in my classroom, but not to the degree that it takes the place of me as the teacher.  I believe that technology should be an to learning, rather than the way to learn.  I will teach my lesson and give the opportunity to use the technology in there projects.  I like the idea of blackboard, because it is a good communication toll.   I used blackboard in high school and in college and the students seem to like it in both.  As a teacher it will help with keeping in contact with the students.  It will provide away for students to look up assignments and other things that are going on in the classroom, if they were absent for the day.  And it will allow the student to see their grades daily.  I also like the idea of Unitedstreamming.  By allowing the students to use Unitedstreaming it gives them a new modern look of an idea.  This could allow the material being taught come alive to the student.  I however do not think that using technology should be the sole source of learning.  I will teach my students in a traditional class setting, alongside with using technology to expand on a topic.  I believe a student should no be in front of a computer all day.  They need to be out and about, so I will take my lessons outside on nice days, so they can appreciate the aesthetic views of the world along with the technological age that we are currently in. &amp;mdash;[[User:Salty|Salty]]
----
I see technology being used in my room on a daily basis.  It is possible to use technology to teach aspects of every subject.  I hope to have a Smartboard to teach the curriculum in an interesting way.  For example, probability can be taught by using the Dice application on the Smartboard and the die are big enough that everyone in the class can see it.  There is also the possibility for creating interactive activities for the kids to use on the Smartboard.  

I also hope that my students will have access to computers so they may use them for such things as Webquests and collaborative group projects.  Stemming from projects involving a computer, integrating technologies like web-cams and digital cameras could be possible.  Possible projects could include not only Social Studies, like becoming a Historian on the Industrial Revolution and creating a webpage about it, but also involve writing to bring Language Arts curriculum to the project as well through creation of a journal.  Science can also be done on the web through either a Webquest or even a virtual dissection.  

I do not want technology used as a &quot;virtual babysitter&quot; by sitting my students in front of a computer program (i.e.. Successmaker, etc.).  Technology is supposed to be integrated in a classroom.  This means that it needs to be used to help in teaching the curriculum not to teach students how to use specific software because it is mandatory for students to use technology in the classroom.
----
I would use technology in the classroom as a tool to engage the students in their learning.  I currently use computers to assist students in both their reading and writing.  We spend time in our school computer lab as well as use our classroom computers.  There are a lot of software programs to help students learn how to read and the students enjoy using them.  I would also use technology in the classroom as a visual tool.  I currently use a smartboard, and have found that students are better engaged in the material because they can come up to the board and manipulate the material.  Fun graphics and pictures also keep the students interested and motivated to learn about a given subject.  I have also had students create theri own WebQuest and have found that it is a fun way to have students learn problem-solving strategies as well as learning how to use the internet.  It is useful to use technology in the class as a means of active learning.  It would be a waste of time and resources if students were just given a computer and said play some games. &amp;mdash;Michael Torres
----
Technology is an important element that I will implement into my classroom. It can help my class stay engaged and make them want to participate in the lesson. I plan to use computers and the like to enhance my lesson plans and make learning fun for my students. My students can use language software programs like Oscar Lake to practice their Spanish and they can get instant feedback on the exercises they complete. They can use PowerPoint to create slideshows and go over their vocabulary words- this will also cut back on wasting paper and index cards. I can play audio files for my students so they can hear how the language is supposed to sound. Since technology is not always reliable, I will always have a back up in case there is a glitch. I don’t want them permanently glued to the computer screen, as many children today already are. I will use technology as a supplement to the curriculum, not the sole means through which my students will learn. I enjoy the different options available to teachers that can make the classroom more interesting and I look forward to using whatever may come out next, but there should still be a balance between traditional and modern educational tools. &amp;mdash;Lauren Spindle}}

Also, we prefer to organize our material into &quot;books&quot; not simply &quot;pages&quot;. There is a preexisting book, [[Electrodynamics]] that might be a good home for these books of yours. If you would like to move your pages into that book, let me know and I can help you do it. Also, if you want some help taking out all the red links, I have a bot that can help with the formatting.

If you have any questions, or if you need any help, don't hesitate to ask me [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my user talk page]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 21:22, 23 May 2007 (UTC)

== Wikibooks v. Wikipedia ==

It is my opinion that wikibooks has strong potential to be a powerful tool. In fact, I would even say that given the same amount of notoriety, wikibooks would better serve the world than wikipedia could. A wikipedia article can list any number of facts and figures, but only a book, written with the target audience in mind, can really be used to teach a subject to people who don't already know it. Wikipedia might be a great resource for collecting all the worlds information, but wikibooks will be the best resource for disseminating that information to the people who need it most.

== Drama and Nonsense ==

Wikibooks is a place where people go for whatever reason. Some people treat it more like a job, some people treat it more like a hobby, and some people treat it like it's a socializing venue. Regardless of our individual motives for coming here, the ultimate aim of wikibooks is to volunteer our collective time and expertise to author textbooks. I don't think anybody comes here to deal with warring, bickering, in-fighting, or legal/political bullshit. Such bullshit is unnecessary and completely unwelcome.

== What Wikibooks Needs ==

There are several things that wikibooks needs. I am going to list them here, in no particular order. 

*Wikibooks needs to attract more new contributors, and keep old contributors active and motivated.
*Wikibooks needs to prepare an infrastructure for a large community. We cannot view ourselves as a small project forever, and we need to prepare for an influx of helpers.
*Wikibooks has some good books, and needs to advertise and distribute them.
*Wikibooks has many many decent books. We need to improve them and make them good.
*Wikibooks needs to appreciate it's passionate members more. Not everybody has the drive to improve this place, and the people who do have that drive should be valued.

== Videogame Manuals ==

My current stance on the subject of videogame guides can be summarized in the following points:
#Videogame guides are not textbooks and they do not belong here on Wikibooks for any reason.
#Videogame guides that are old and have been here for some time should be given the opportunity to be transwikied to a more appropriate location.
#New videogame manuals should be deleted on sight, and the authors should be informed of the fact that videogame guides are not textbooks.
#Books about videogames, including critical reviews or discussions about how to write or program videogames are acceptable here, as they are textbooks.

== Inclusionism vs Deletionism ==

Wikipedia is breaking into partisian politics, with the &quot;inclusionists&quot; fighting the &quot;deletionists&quot; on every issue. It is sadder still that these political differentiations are being felt here on wikibooks as well. I am inclined to say that most things on wikibooks can stay on wikibooks, assuming it can be made part of an acceptable book in the future. Too often, however, material sits around forever and never becomes anything more then a stub artical.</text>

==Example of glossary link==

&lt;span id=&quot;g-esphagus&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Espohagus - a tube made of muscle that goes from the mouth to the stomach; food that is swallowed goes down this tube


&lt;span id=&quot;drone&quot;&gt;'''drone''' ''(noun)'' &amp;ndash; a continuous low-pitched humming sound&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span id=&quot;grimace&quot;&gt;'''grimace''' ''(verb)'' &amp;ndash; to make a face in pain&lt;/span&gt;

==What are the parts of the stomach?==

At the top of the stomach is a tube where food comes in from the [[User:Kfasimpaur/sandbox2#g-esphagus | esophagus]]. When you swallow, this tube opens so food can go in the stomach.

The stomach is made of muscle. These muscles help to break down food by mashing it into smaller pieces. The muscles also make waves pushing the food further down the digestive track. This is called peristalsis and happens from the esophagus all the way to the large intestine.

The stomach is lined with glands. These special cells make a liquid that is released into the stomach. This liquid is called gastric juice. The gastric juice has acid in it and helps break down or digest food.

The bottom part of the stomach is called the pyloric area. At the bottom of the stomach is another opening. This leads to the small intestine.</text>

This is a brief description (proposal) for how book stages should be used:

;0:Book is a stub, contains little or no contents. Main page consists of either a paragraph or an outline with red links.
;1:Book is expanding. New pages are being created, the TOC is being expanded and reordered. Many pages are stubs or contain very little content.
;2:The basic TOC has been finalized, although more new chapters are added occasionaly. Many pages contain significant text content, or image content, but are not integrated. Pages frequently are not properly formatted.
;3:Book pages contain significant content, including images and other media, proper formatting, and templates. Some book-specific templates are being designed and implemented, including inter-page navigation. Book has a printable version, and possibly a PDF version. 
;4:Book pages contain good content, including multimedia, example problems, explanations, etc. Book has a printable version and a PDF version, and possibly sub-versions of each. Book has significant meta pages including LMOS and support pages for new contributors. Book has a cover page, listings of resources, and proper notices of GFDL content.</text>

== Glossaries ==

I agree that Wikijunior glossaries are a mess (I think you used the word inconsistent.) We need someone with a knowledge of the subject, interest, and a vision for how they should be to come along and propose a standard that makes sense. All of the books either need glossaries badly, or need to have their glossaries filled out so if you wanted to pick a few modules in a book and create something as a mock up, I expect your ideas would be well received. 

One place we might be able to get some prefab content to build glossaries is [[wikt:Main Page|Wiktionary]]. We just need to make sure and credit them if we use their definitions.

If you would like my help with anything just ask. I'll do whatever I can. Glossaries are something that has been on my to-do list for a while. I invite you to be bold, and encourage you to help us improve the books. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:28, 29 May 2007 (UTC)

Sorry for the lack of reply. I have been very busy in RL. One thing that could be done to make the glossary links distinctive is to simply italicize them. I'm not sure if what you have described regarding treating glossary items like references could be done with templates, java script and css, or would require and extension to the Mediawiki software. 

I guess the [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge/Technical_Chat|technical chat]] page would be the place to ask. 

I think I would like to see whatever method we use make it easy to print out a glossary where the definitions could all be found in a single section so that when we created the book, we could easily create a printed glossary as well. 

Have a look at my [[User:Xixtas/Sandbox/Glossary_Test|Glossary Test]] to see if you think something like that would work.

Does that make sense to you? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:43, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

::The protocol is &quot;be bold&quot;. If you would like to solicit input, the [[Talk:Wikijunior|Wikijunior Talk Page]] would be a good place to do it. You do not need to ask permission to make improvements, though. You should do what you think is right. I think the idea is great! but I expect it will be refined over time. If you would like to add a section on glossaries to the [[Wikijunior:Style_Guide|Wikijunior style guide]] (or make any other changes to that document) please do so.  People will see the changes you have made and if they have concerns, they will bring them up.

I love it! You don't need to keep repeating my name in the credits though. I didn't actually take any of the photos, just added the letters and cropped/resized/filled.

== Would Like Your Opinion ==

Hi Karen, 

Can you take a look at a book that I'm working on? I'd appreciate your input on it including any ideas as to how to make it better. You are also welcome to dig in and make any changes you think appropriate. I will probably move it out of my user space once I get around 15 pages built.  The intended audience is first or second graders. [[User:Xixtas/World_at_work|The World at Work]]

Thanks, 
Randy

: Thanks for the feedback, I appreciate the complements. Regarding the relationship of the photos to the country, they are not supposed to be iconic. They are mainly based on what is available as much as anything else. I selected the Kenya Zookeeper photo  because there was so little to choose from in east Africa. Two places that I've really had trouble finding good pictures are Scandinavia and East Africa. I will continue to look for photos that represent the country better. 

:Regarding Wikijunior, I would like to see more people too, particularly primary school teachers. I agree 100% with everything you have said. Our reading level is generally way too high. Another thing I would like is to see some class project books start up in the fall. Perhaps a High school class would be interested in writing a non-fiction book for 3rd graders. I'm happy that you are giving Wikijunior some exposure in these communities. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:45, 1 July 2007 (UTC)

::Those are wonderful photos. My concern is that with many of them the expression on the face isn't as clear as I would like it to be. Do you have the negatives? Perhaps scanning the negatives themselves would result in a clearer picture. Particularly the picture of the spice merchant would be great if the face was a little clearer. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:41, 15 July 2007 (UTC)

::P.S. Also take a peak at my current project Wikijunior [[User:Xixtas/Class_Projects|help for class projects]]. Any help you can offer in getting this going would be greatly appreciated. -- [[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:48, 15 July 2007 (UTC)

== Photos ==

I love the photos. They are really wonderful. They do a great job of capturing the feeling of life there. I have never been to Africa, but I lived in Honduras and Colombia for a little while. The photos of open air markets remind me of that. I think a book on life in Africa would be great! If I can help in any way let me know. I have put aside the World at Work book for the time being. I'm currently working offline on a baby animal counting book. ;-) --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:56, 25 September 2007 (UTC)

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Israel|Israel]] | [[Cookbook:Palestinian Cuisine|Palestine]]
[[Image:Kibbeh.jpg|right|thumb|Kibbeh]]

==Ingredients==
* Half kilo (500 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) of thin [[Cookbook:Bulgur|Bulgur]]
* Half kilo of thick Bulgur
* 2-2.5 cups of [[Cookbook:Semolina|semolina]]
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]] as needed

===For the filling===
* 1 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]] of [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]]
* 6-7 cut fried [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]] (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Pine Nut|pine nuts]] (optional)
* spicy [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]] or [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili]] (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Turmeric|Turmeric]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]

==Procedure==
# Add the meat to the onion and fry, adding 1 spoon of flavor to the cutlets of Bulgur that to the meat.
# Put both types of the Bulgur together, fill with warm water that will cover the Bulgur in several centimeters, and leave it for about an hour until part of the water is absorbed into the Bulgur.
# Take every time a handful and squeeze properly and put it in a different bowls until everything is finished, then pour off all the remaining water and return all the squeezed wheatgroats into the big bowl.
# Put 2 glasses of semolina, one teaspoon of Turmeric, a replete spoon of salt, and one egg, and massage everything together with your hands, including closing the hand fists until the dough gets a little like chewing gum. If semolina is missing, it is possible to add a little more to it according to the need, until we would get a sticky dough. 
# Create big balls of dough and put them aside. 
# Open every ball of dough and insert a full spoon of the meat and close. 
# Boil water in a pot with a little salt and Turmeric. When the water has boiled up, flatten every ball in the meat that we got in a somewhat shape of a flat full moon in the size of little plate. Put it gently in the boiling water until the Kibbeh will float, and this will be the sign that it is ready.

Kibbeh can be eaten immediately as it gets ready, or [[Cookbook:Pan Frying|pan fried]] on both sides. 

''Absolutely delicious.''

== My teaching philosophy ==

My name is Cyril Mechkov. For the last 20 years I have been teaching analog circuitry at the Technical University of Sofia. My teaching philosophy (see my last [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my_work/conferences/ewme_2006/paper.htm paper] to know more about it) is simple:

[[Image:At_the_whitebord_1000.jpg|right|thumb|500px|&lt;center&gt;A discussion about biasing idea (at the whiteboard in the lecture hall).&lt;/center&gt;]]

1. Electronic circuits are based on clear and simple basic ideas, which may be derived from our routine.

2. In order to really understand electronic circuits, we - human beings - have first to reveal these basic ideas.

3. In order to successfully present circuits to students, we teachers have to build them according to the basic ideas revealed.

4. In order to make students create new circuits, we teachers have to (re)invent the existing circuits according to the basic ideas behind them.

I just believe that we - human beings - can really understand abstract electronic circuits by using human, non-electrical means. Basic ideas behind circuits are &quot;non-electrical&quot;. So, they do not depend on the specific implementation (tube, transistor, op-amp etc.); they are eternal!

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Wikipedia contributions ==

I joined Wikipedia in 2006 creating a few stories about [[w:Negative resistance|negative resistance]], [[w:Virtual ground|virtual ground]], [[w:Voltage-to-current converter|voltage-to-current converter]] and [[w:Current-to-voltage converter|current-to-voltage converter]]. Only, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia where everyone can publish separate ideas, which are not connected to each other. Wikibooks is more adequate for creative people that have a chain of ideas; in a wikibook, they can expose their ideas in a set of pages that are hierarchically connected to each other.

== [[Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]] wikibook ==

I have established [[Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]] in 2007, in order to show how to reveal the ideas behind circuits. The main purpose of this e-book is to reveal once and for all the true, pure and real fundamental ideas behind circuits. It establishes new human-friendly circuit [[Circuit Idea/Philosophy|philosophy]] as an alternative to the classical formal &quot;robot-friendly&quot; approach:) This philosophy relies more on human imagination than on logical reasoning. It considers analog circuitry more as art than science and the creation of electronic circuits as a result of human fantasy, imagination and enthusiasm. If you have an interesting story about amazing circuit phenomenon, contribute to the novel book!

== Joining students to Circuit idea ==

In the beginning of March, 2008 I decided to [[Circuit Idea/Technical University of Sofia|join  my students]] to ''Circuit idea''. I started this initiative &quot;in sport&quot; but it turned out so successful and exciting that now I am entirely absorbed in this new web undertaking. I have told how it has begun in the [[Talk:Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film|discussion]] of the first completely finished page that my students and I have dedicated to the famous [[Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film|Ohm's experiment]].

You can imagine how powerful this approach is where students and their teacher, all together, work on the same common project! They add, edit and continuously refine it; they learn how to present what they have done to other, how to contribute a wiki project, how to communicate with people, etc. Furthermore, any web visitors (including other students and their teachers) through the world can join and enrich this open project! If you are a teacher, student or you just like education, join our web initiative! Here are links to my student groups:

&lt;center&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Group 64a|Group 64a]] • [[Circuit Idea/Group 65a|Group 65a]] • [[Circuit Idea/Group 66a|Group 66a]] • [[Circuit Idea/Group 67a|Group 67a]] • [[Circuit Idea/Group 68a|Group 68a]] • [[Circuit Idea/Group 64b|Group 64b]] • [[Circuit Idea/Group 65b|Group 65b]] • [[Circuit Idea/Group 66b|Group 66b]] • [[Circuit Idea/Group 67b|Group 67b]] • [[Circuit Idea/Group 68b|Group 68b]]&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Equivalence and Normal Forms==
Until now, we only discussed single formulae and their semantical
properties. In this section we start investigating whether formulae
can be transformed into another form, without changing their
semantics. For this we introduce the concept of ''logical
equivalence'', which can be used to investigate the transformation of
a given formula into its ''normal form''.
==Definition 6==

The formulae &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are called (semantically) equivalent, iff for all assignments &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}(F)= \mathcal{A}(G)&lt;/math&gt;. We write &lt;math&gt;F \equiv G&lt;/math&gt;.

Formulae containing different subformulae can be equivalent, e.g. all
tautologies are equivalent.
More interesting is the following theorem:

==Theorem 3 (Substituitivity)==

Let &lt;math&gt;F \equiv G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; a formula which contains at least one
occurrence of the subformula &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Then it holds &lt;math&gt;H \equiv H'&lt;/math&gt;, where
&lt;math&gt;H'&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; by substituting any occurrence of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:''' The proof is by induction over the structure of the
subformula &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;: 

Assume for the induction start, that &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is atomic, hence &lt;math&gt;H=F&lt;/math&gt;
holds, and the result of substituting the only occurrence of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; by
&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; results in &lt;math&gt;H' =G&lt;/math&gt; and because &lt;math&gt;F \equiv G&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;H \equiv
H'&lt;/math&gt;.
Assume the theorem holds for all proper subformulae of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;: If &lt;math&gt;F =
H&lt;/math&gt; we have the same argumentation as above in the start of the
induction. If &lt;math&gt;F \neq H&lt;/math&gt; we have three cases:
  
*&lt;math&gt;H = \lnot h_1&lt;/math&gt;: Because &lt;math&gt;h_1&lt;/math&gt; is a subformula of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; we can   conclude that &lt;math&gt;h_1 \equiv  h_1'&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;h_1'&lt;/math&gt; is constructed by substituting any occurrence  of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. From the definition   of the semantics of &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; we conclude that &lt;math&gt;\lnot h_1 \equiv  \lnot h_1'&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;H \equiv  H_1'&lt;/math&gt;. Where H_1 is equivalent formula constructed by replacing F in H by G, resulting in H_1
* &lt;math&gt;H = (h_1 \lor h_2)&lt;/math&gt;: Assume without loss of generality, that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; occurs in &lt;math&gt;h_1&lt;/math&gt;. Then, again we can conclude from the   induction assumption, that &lt;math&gt;h_1 \equiv h_1'&lt;/math&gt; and from the definition of the semantics of &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; we conclude, that &lt;math&gt;(h_1 \lor h_2) = (h_1' \lor   h_2)&lt;/math&gt;. 
*&lt;math&gt;H = (h_1 \land h_2)&lt;/math&gt; is similar.

==Theorem 4==

The following equivalences hold:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(F \land F)&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;  

&lt;math&gt;(F \lor F)&lt;/math&gt;    &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;   (Idempotence) 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(F \land G)&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;(G \land F)&lt;/math&gt;  

&lt;math&gt;(F \lor G)&lt;/math&gt;    &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;(G \lor F)&lt;/math&gt;  (Commutativity)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;((F \land G) \land H)&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(F \land (G \land
       H))&lt;/math&gt; 
 
&lt;math&gt;((F \lor G) \lor H)&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(F \lor (G \lor H))&lt;/math&gt;
(Associativity) 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(F \land (F \lor G))&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;  

&lt;math&gt;(F \lor (F \land G))&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;   (Absorption)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(F \land (G \lor H))&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;((F \land G) \lor (F
       \land H))&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(F \lor (G \land H))&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;((F \lor G) \land (F
\lor H))&lt;/math&gt;  (Distributivity)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\lnot ~\lnot F&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;   (Double negation) 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\lnot(F \land G)&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(\lnot F \lor \lnot G)&lt;/math&gt;  

&lt;math&gt;\lnot(F \lor G)&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;(\lnot F \land \lnot G)&lt;/math&gt;  (deMorgan's rule)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(F \lor G)&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, if  &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a tautology 

&lt;math&gt;(F \land G)&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, if  &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a tautology (Rule of Tautology)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(F \lor G)&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, if  &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;  is unsatisfiable  

&lt;math&gt;(F \land G)&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, if  &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;  is unsatisfiable  (Rule of Unsatisfiability)



'''Proof:''' All equivalences can be proved by truth tables. This is
done here for the second rule of absorption:
{|border =&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;8&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
!&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; 
!&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;  
!(&lt;math&gt;F\land G&lt;/math&gt;)  
!(&lt;math&gt;F \lor (F \land G&lt;/math&gt;))
|-
|false  
|false  
|&lt;center&gt;false&lt;/center&gt;  
|&lt;center&gt;false&lt;/center&gt; 
|-
|false 
|true  
|&lt;center&gt;false&lt;/center&gt; 
|&lt;center&gt;false&lt;/center&gt; 
|-
|true 
|false 
|&lt;center&gt;false&lt;/center&gt; 
|&lt;center&gt;true&lt;/center&gt;  
|-
|true   
|true  
|&lt;center&gt;true&lt;/center&gt;    
|&lt;center&gt;true&lt;/center&gt;  
|-
|}

Let us now use these equivalences together with the theorem of
substituitivity (TS) to prove the following equivalence:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
((A\lor (B\lor C)) \land (C \lor \lnot A))\equiv  ((B \land \lnot A) \lor C)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;((A \lor (B \lor C)) \land (C \lor \lnot A))&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;((A \lor B) \lor C) \land (C \lor \lnot A))&lt;/math&gt; Associativity  and  TS 
 
&lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;((C \lor (A \lor B)) \land ((C \lor \lnot A))&lt;/math&gt; Commutativity and TS  
 
&lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;(C \lor ((A \lor B) \land \lnot A))&lt;/math&gt;      Distributivity
 
&lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(C \lor (\lnot A \land (A \lor B)))&lt;/math&gt;      Commutativity and TS 

&lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(C \lor ((\lnot A \land A) \lor (\lnot A \land B))&lt;/math&gt;      Distributivity and TS 

&lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;(C \lor (\lnot A \land B))&lt;/math&gt;      Unsatisfiability and TS

&lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;(C \lor (B \land \lnot A))&lt;/math&gt;      Commutativity and TS 
 
&lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;((B \land \lnot A) \lor C)&lt;/math&gt;      Commutativity and TS

==Definition 7 (Normal Forms)==

A literal is an atomic formula or the negation of an
atomic formula (positive or negative, resp.)
A formula  &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is in conjunctive normalform (CNF) iff


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;F = (\bigwedge^n_{i=1} (\bigvee^{m_i}_{j=1}  L_{i,j}))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;L_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is a literal.


A formula  &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is in disjunctive  normalform (DNF) iff
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;F = (\bigvee^n_{i=1} (\bigwedge^{m_i}_{j=1} L_{i,j}))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;L_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is a literal

==Theorem 5==

For every formula  &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; there is an equivalent formula which is in DNF
and an equivalent formula which is in CNF.

Let us  formulate an algorithm to transform a given formula F into
an equivalent  normalform:

'''Given:''' '''A formula &lt;math&gt;F &lt;/math&gt;'''

   
1. Substitute  in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; every subformula of the form &lt;center&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;\lnot ~\lnot ~G \text{ by }  G&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;\lnot ~(G ~\land ~H)   \text{ by }   (\lnot ~G ~\lor ~\lnot ~H)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;\lnot ~(G ~\lor ~H) \text{ by }  (\lnot ~G ~\land ~\lnot ~H) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 
until there is no subformula of this kind.&lt;br&gt; 
2. Substitute in the result from the above step   every subformula of the form &lt;center&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;(F ~\lor ~(G~\land~H))   \text{ by }   ((F~\lor~G) ~\land ~(F~\lor~H))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;  
                                     
::&lt;math&gt;((F~\land~G) ~\lor ~H) \text{ by } ((F~\lor~H) ~\land ~(G~\lor~H))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
until there is no subformula of this kind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''Result: An equivalent formula in CNF'''

Until now, we investigate the transformation of a propositional formula into an
equivalent normal form. Another problem in the context of normal forms is, to
construct a normal form formula from a given truth table; i.e. the formula
itself is not known, but its behaviour is given by a truth table. 
Let's  read a  normalform formula from a truth table: Assume a formula &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, which is given by the following
truthtable.

In order to construct a formula in DNF, which is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;,
we have to take into account, that every line of the table which
yields the  truthvalue &lt;math&gt;true&lt;/math&gt; gives one conjunction: if the
assignment of the literal
&lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;true&lt;/math&gt; it is included as &lt;math&gt; \ldots \land A_i \land  \ldots&lt;/math&gt;, if  is
&lt;math&gt;false&lt;/math&gt; we include &lt;math&gt;\ldots \land \lnot A_i \ldots \land \ldots&lt;/math&gt;. For the above example
we get as a DNF: 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(\lnot A  \land  \lnot  B\land  \lnot C )  \lor &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;( A  \land  \lnot  B\land  \lnot C )   \lor    &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;( A  \land  \lnot  B\land      C ) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;          
&lt;/center&gt;


If we change in the above procedure the roles of &lt;math&gt;true&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;false&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; we arrive at a CNF: 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;( A \lor B \lor\lnot C)  \land &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(A\lor\lnot B\lor C) \land &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;  

&lt;math&gt;(A \lor  \lnot B \lor \lnot C) \land &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;( \lnot A \lor \lnot B \lor C) \land &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(\lnot A \lor \lnot B \lor \lnot C) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


We introduce a special representation  for formulae in  
normalform. In our circuit-example (circuit) from the introduction
we already used a very special form of normalforms, namely the
implication form for formulae in CNF: every subformula &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; of a
conjunction &lt;math&gt;F_1, \cdots , F_l&lt;/math&gt; is written as: 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
A_1 \land  \cdots \land A_n \to B_1 \lor \cdots \lor B_m
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
It is easy to see, that this implication is logically equivalent to a
disjunction &lt;math&gt;\lnot A_1 \lor \cdots \lor  \lnot A_n \lor B_1 \lor \cdots \lor B_m&lt;/math&gt;. Sometimes
the implication is written as 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
A_1,  \cdots , A_n \to B_1; \cdots ; B_m
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Even the following ambiguous notation is used in some cases, where the
comma in the premiss stands for a conjunction and the comma in the
conclusion for a disjunction:
 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
A_1,  \cdots , A_n \to B_1, \cdots , B_m
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
For some important procedures for  logical reasoning it is
mandatory to represent the formulae not only in one of the above
notations for a normalform, moreover, it is necessary to use the
so-called clause-form from the following definition.


==Definition 8 ==

If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a formula in CNF, i.e.  
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; F = (L_{1,1} \lor \ldots \lor L_{1,{n_1}}) \land
\ldots \land (L_{k,1} \lor \ldots \lor L_{k,{n_k}}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 
then its corresponding representation in clause form is given as
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; F = \{ \{L_{1,1}, \ldots, L_{1,{n_1}}\}, 
\ldots , \{L_{k,1}, \ldots, L_{k,{n_k}}\} \} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The sets &lt;math&gt;\{L_{i,1}, \ldots, L_{i,{n_i}}\}&lt;/math&gt; are called
clauses.

This representation as sets of literals has the  advantage that
literals occur in no special order and that multiple occurrences of a 
literal in a disjunction are &quot;merged&quot; in its clause form.
Note that as a consequence we have built in associativity,
commutativity and Idempotence into the representation.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; ( (A_1 \lor \lnot A_2) \land (A_3 \land A_3) )&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\{\{A_1, \lnot A_2\}, \{A_3\}\} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(A_3 \land (\lnot A_2 \lor A_1)) &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==Problems==
====Problem 15 (Propositional)====
Create formulae in (a) conjunctive or (b) disjuncive normal form which are equivalent to:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; A \stackrel{\cdot} \vee B \stackrel{\cdot} \vee C &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\stackrel{\cdot} \vee&lt;/math&gt; denotes exclusive or.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

====Problem 16 (Propositional)====

The theorem prover OTTER uses the following optimization rules for clause sets:

'''Subsumption:''' If the literals of a clause &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are a subset of an another clause &lt;math&gt;K'&lt;/math&gt; remove &lt;math&gt;K'&lt;/math&gt; from the set of clauses.&lt;br&gt;
'''Deleting by unit clause:''' If the set of clauses contains a unit clause &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; -here &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is single literal unit-clause- every occurrence of a complementary literal &lt;math&gt;\overline{L}&lt;/math&gt; in a clause is deleted.

Which laws of the logic justify these procedures?

&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

====Problem 17 (Propositional)====

Generate truth tables for the following formulae.
Give the conjunctive and disjunctive normal forms of the
formulae. Which one of the relations &lt;math&gt;F \models G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G \models F&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F \equiv G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F = G&lt;/math&gt; holds?
          
#&lt;math&gt;F = (A \land \lnot (B \lor C)) \stackrel{\cdot} \vee ((A \to B) \lor (A \to C),)&lt;/math&gt; whereas &lt;math&gt;F \stackrel{\cdot} \vee G = F \leftrightarrow (\lnot G)&lt;/math&gt; applies. 
#&lt;math&gt;G = ((A \lor (B \land A)) \to \lnot A) \lor C&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

====Problem 18 (Propositional)====

Generate a CNF and a DNF form the following truth table for the formula &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

{|border = &quot;1&quot;   cellspacing = &quot;0&quot; cellpadding= &quot;10&quot;

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: pronounciation → pronunciation using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Consonant Assimilation==

There are occasions when voiced consonants are pronounced like their surd mates (e.g. ''п'' instead of ''б'') and vice versa (''б'' instead of ''п'').

Voiced consonants being at the end of a word, before a surd or assimilated voiced consonant are pronounced as surd sounds.

'''го́рад''' &quot;horat&quot; a town (final ''д'' pronounced as ''т'')

'''мар́оз''' &quot;maros&quot; frost (final ''з'' pronounced as ''с'')

'''Пары́ж''' &quot;Parysh&quot; Paris (final ''ж'' pronounced as ''ш'')

'''адка́з''' &quot;atkas&quot; an answer (final ''з'' pronounced as ''с''; ''д'' before ''к'' pronounced as ''т'')

'''дождж''' &quot;doshch&quot; rain (final ''дж'' pronounced as ''ч''; ''ж'' before assimilated ''дж'' pronounced as ''ш'')

This process causes a number of homophones, i.e. words having different spelling but the same pronunciation.

'''кот''' a cat - '''код''' a code

'''ка́зка''' a tale - '''ка́ска''' a helmet

The opposite phenomenon takes place when a surd consonant occurs after a vowel before a voiced (and not assimilated) consonant. Then it is pronounced as a voiced consonant itself.

'''футбо́л''' &quot;fudbol&quot; football (''т'' after ''у'' and before ''б'' pronounced as ''д'')

'''вакза́л''' &quot;vagzal&quot; a railway station (''к'' after ''а'' and  before ''з'' pronounced as English ''g'')

This process does not take place before ''в'', ''л'', ''м'', ''н'' and ''р'' sounds though they are voiced.

'''патрэ́бны''' &quot;patrebny&quot; necessary (''т'' not assimilated to ''д'')

==Noun Gender==

Each noun belongs to one of the three genders. The &quot;theoretical&quot; rule for noun gender is the following.

* nouns ending by ''а'' or ''я'' are feminine: '''вада́''' water, '''Ірла́ндыя''' Ireland
* nouns ending by ''о'', ''ё''; ''э'' or ''е'' are neuter: '''вакно́''' a window, '''ра́дыё''' radio
* nouns ending by a consonant are masculine '''кот''' a cat, '''го́рад''' a town

In practice, however, the things are far not so simple. First of all, with neuter nouns, final unstressed ''о'' or ''э'' due to akannie transform into ''а'' to get an ending typical for feminine nouns.

'''мо́ра''' a sea (''а'' is used instead of unstressed ''э'')

'''ко́ла''' a wheel (''а'' is used instead of unstressed ''о'')

There is a large number of nouns ending by a consonant but belonging to the feminine gender.

'''мыш''' a mouse

'''ноч''' a night

Finally, there exist a number of nouns ending by ''а'' or ''я'' but being masculine.

'''мужчы́на''' a man

'''саба́ка''' a dog

'''чарапа́ха''' a turtle

==Plural Nouns==

Plural nouns usually end by ''ы''.

With feminine and neuter nouns, the plural ending is never stressed. If a feminine noun has a stressed ending in singular, it becomes unstressed in plural.

'''вада́''' - '''во́ды''' water (waters)

'''акно́''' - '''во́кны''' a window (windows) ('''в''' here appears only before o, because  native Belarusian words can't begin with '''o-''')

'''гара́''' - '''го́ры''' a mountain (mountains)

'''каза́''' - '''ко́зы''' a goat (goats)

'''цана́''' - '''цэ́ны''' a price (prices)

'''царква́''' - '''цэ́рквы''' a church (churches)

With feminine and neuter nouns having unstressed endings, the stress remains unshifted.

'''варо́на''' - '''варо́ны''' a crow (crows)

'''дрэ́ва''' (neuter) - '''дрэ́вы''' a tree (trees)

'''жа́ба''' - '''жа́бы''' a toad (toads)

'''жанчы́на''' - '''жанчы́ны''' a woman (women)

'''каро́ва''' - '''каро́вы''' a cow (cows)

'''ко́ла''' (neuter) - '''ко́лы''' a wheel (wheels)

'''краiна''' - '''краiны''' a country (countries)

'''кра́ма''' - '''кра́мы''' a shop (shops)

'''мо́ра''' (neuter) - '''мо́ры''' a sea (seas)

'''мыш''' - '''мы́шы''' a mouse (mice)

'''ноч''' - '''но́чы''' a night (nights)

'''фа́ра''' - '''фа́ры''' a headlight (headlights)

'''ха́та''' - '''ха́ты''' a house (houses)

'''шко́ла''' - '''шко́лы''' a school (schools)

Masculine nouns may have either stressed or unstressed ending in plural. The first case applies to most monosyllabic nouns. But there is no strict rule to determine the stress position in plural for masculine nouns.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Stressed plural ''ы''
! Unstressed plural ''ы''
|-
|'''кот'''-'''каты́''' a cat (cats)&lt;br&gt;
'''го́лас'''-'''галасы́''' a voice (voices)&lt;br&gt;
'''го́рад'''-'''гарады́''' a town (towns)&lt;br&gt;
'''дождж'''-'''дажджы́''' rain (rains)&lt;br&gt;
'''маро́з'''-'''маразы́''' frost (frosts)&lt;br&gt;
'''па́шпарт'''-'''пашпарты́''' a passport (passports)&lt;br&gt;
'''сакрата́р'''-'''сакратары́''' a secretary (secretaries)&lt;br&gt;
'''слон'''-'''сланы́''' an elephant (elephants)&lt;br&gt;
|'''адка́з'''-'''адка́зы''' an answer (answers)&lt;br&gt;
'''бара́н'''-'''бара́ны''' a sheep (sheep)&lt;br&gt;
'''вакза́л'''-'''вакза́лы''' a railway station (railway stations)&lt;br&gt;
'''дырэ́ктар'''-'''дырэ́ктары''' a manager (managers)&lt;br&gt;
'''пала́ц'''-'''пала́цы''' a palace (palaces)&lt;br&gt;
'''партыза́н'''-'''партыза́ны''' a guerrilla (guerrillas)&lt;br&gt;
'''студэ́нт'''-'''студэ́нты''' a student (students)&lt;br&gt;
'''туры́ст'''-'''туры́сты''' a tourist (tourists)&lt;br&gt;
'''тэа́тр'''-'''тэа́тры''' a theatre (theatres)&lt;br&gt;
|}

Notice the last word, ''тэатр''. The ''э'' letter here violates the rule of akannie - a situation which is common with borrowed words.

|Text marked like this is used to discuss an R-specific point. The basics of R can be learned by reading these sections in the order they appear in the book. There will also be commands that can be entered directly into R; you should be able to copy-and-paste them directly into your R session&lt;ref&gt;Depending on how you are viewing this book, may see a &quot;&gt;&quot; character in front of each command. This is not part of the command to type: it is produced by R itself to prompt you to type something. This character should be automatically omitted if you are copying and pasting from the online version of this book, but if you are reading the paper or pdf version, you should omit the &quot;&amp;gt;&quot; prompt when typing into R.&lt;/ref&gt;. Try the following to see how to use R as a simple calculator
|100+2/3
|&gt; 100+2/3
[1] 100.6667
|In the absence of any instructions of what to do with the output of a command, R usually prints the result to the screen. For the time being, ignore the [1] before the answer: we will see that this is useful when R outputs many numbers at once. Note that R respects the standard mathematical rules of carrying out multiplication and division before addition and subtraction: it divides 2 by 3 before adding 100.

{{Code:Interpreted

|R commands can sometimes be rather difficult to follow, so occasionally it can be useful to annotate them with comments. This can be done by typing a hash (#) character: any further text on the same line is ignored by R. This will be used extensively in the R examples in this wikibook, e.g.
|#this is a comment: R will ignore it
(100+2)/3    #You can use round brackets to group operations so that they are carried out first
5*10^2       #The symbol * means multiply, and ^ means &quot;to the power&quot;, so this gives 5 times (10 squared), i.e. 500
1/0          #R knows about infinity (and minus infinity)
0/0          #undefined results take the value NaN (&quot;not a number&quot;)
(0i-9)^(1/2) #for the mathematically inclined, you can force R to use complex numbers
|&gt; #this is a comment: R will ignore it
&gt; (100+2)/3    #You can use round brackets to group operations so that they are carried out first
[1] 34
&gt; 5*10^2       #The symbol * means multiply, and ^ means &quot;to the power&quot;, so this is 5 times (10 squared)
[1] 500

[1] Inf
&gt; 0/0          #undefined results take the value NaN (&quot;not a number&quot;)
[1] NaN
&gt; (0i-9)^(1/2) #for the mathematically inclined, you can force R to use complex numbers
[1] 0+3i
|* If you don't know anything about complex numbers, don't worry: they are not important here. 
* Note that you can't use curly brackets {} or square brackets [] to group operations together }}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Developing Social Learning Skills ==
In the opening sections of Marc Segar's book, he explains that always looking for new things to think about is something he has found to be a successful technique.  This seems to be related to the repetition of thought thing he mentions.  This triggered memories of ending up in closed logic loops and having to develop techniques for getting out of them.  Just thinking about other things never actually solved the problem, so returning to them with new approaches was necessary, and in that respect, I disagree with Marc Segar.  This is followed up by other useful tricks for self development I have had to use.  JWM.
* In all likelihood, you may be your own best teacher.
* To get the best out of your self education, it is probably necessary to adopt certain attitudes and behaviours that best enable you to research and study better ways to deal with the world.
* The habit of spending time thinking things through is often quite useful, but it's easy to waste that time trapped in logic loops.
* If you realise that you are trapped in such a loop, then questioning and testing the logic can help.  You can learn a LOT from doing this.
* If it is not possible to test the logic, then finding something else to think about for a while is probably better than wasting your time.
* The basic method behind developing anything such as an invention, a product, an idea or a recipe for a really great cup of coffee is to repeat through the different phases of a Development Cycle.
** The phases of the development cycle are: design -&gt; build -&gt; test -&gt; post-mortem.
** To make a recipe for a really great cup of coffee start by making or obtaining a basic one (design), then make a cup (build), taste it (test), then find something that isn't really great about it (post mortem).  Change the recipe to make it better (design) and repeat until you have a really great cup of coffee.  The recipe should now be for a really great cup of coffee.
** These steps may seem rather obvious, but it is very easy to lose track of where you are in this cycle when developing more complex things such as rules to live life by.  Skipping steps in the cycle or not doing them properly often ends up in wasting lots of time.  Also, shortening the time taken for a step while still performing it properly allows development to occur at a faster pace.
** The &quot;scientific method&quot; is very similar to the development cycle, but where the development cycle applies to practical things, the scientific method applies to theories.  The scientific method is better described in other places and is therefore beyond of this book.
* The &quot;reduction algorithm&quot;:
** Having figured something out, it is often possible to learn even more by eliminating the irrelevant from what you have learned and dissecting the rest to its simplest possible components.
** Those smaller components are often more applicable to radically different aspects of life, and are also much easier to explain and to prove to other people.
** Knowing a few broadly applicable rules in life is much easier than knowing lots of complex ones.
** Putting up with things you don't have to put up with usually wastes yet more time.
* It's fair to say that &quot;hyperfocusing&quot; on solving social interaction problems is destructive to the process of learning about social interactions.  Example follows:  XXX
* Taking the perspective that &quot;nobody ever does anything without a reason&quot; helps a great deal when trying to understand people.
* Running away from threats can mean surviving, but possibly running forever.
* Running into threats can mean suffering serious loss.
* Keeping a safe distance from threats can mean gaining the opportunity to study them.
* Take pains to find and fix your mistakes. Apologise for errors with a straightforward, unashamed manner without apologising for yourself. You are not your mistakes.
* Accept criticism with sincere thanks, regardless of how it is offered. 
* Gratitude is your best weapon against sarcastic comments and rudeness. 
* When you criticize incorporate a compliment into your statement with optional humor. This is better than lying or being evasive. Example, &quot;You have a wonderful sense of musical phrasing. I didn't even notice that you kicked me twice. Can we dance again?&quot;
* Show interest in a calm way.
* Cultivate an easy manner.
* Do not pretend to be all-knowing. If you don't know what they're talking about and want to talk to them, your ignorance is valuable. Admit you don't know what the conversation is about, but you are curious.
* Trying to memorise rules and remember them later is probably not the best thing to do.  A way that seems to work better is to try to reason on them and leave it till a later date for them to show their worth.
* If life isn't like falling off a log, you're probably doing something wrong.

== Documentation ==
This template is designed to act as a &quot;box&quot; in the style of separate information boxes as seen in textbooks (often labelled Box 1.1, etc.). It is assumed that the content of the box is saved on a separate page. The name of the page is passed to this template and it is automatically [[transcluded]] as the contents of the box. When writing a book, this separates the contents of each information box from the main text: usually a desirable feature.

=== Titles ===
A minimal use of the template can be seen by providing a single unnamed argument, which is interpreted as the path to the page to be transcluded into the box. This can be useful for title-less boxed, or if you want to have the title of the box in the transcluded file itself. However, this means that you cannot take advantage of the  collapsible box mechanism, detailed below.

If two unnamed arguments are provided, the first argument is treated as the box title, and the second as the path to the page to be transcluded. 

=== Collapsible boxes ===
You can use the &quot;collapsible&quot; parameter to turn long boxes, which may distract a reader from the main text, into drop-down boxes. Use &quot;collapsible=hidden&quot; to have the contents hidden by default. This cannot be used on title-less boxes (there has to be a titlebar to contain the drop-arrow when the box is hidden).

=== Extra functionality ===
To provide a link to allow editing of the transcluded page, a self-styled &quot;edit&quot; link is provided. This uses #rel2abs, so assumes that the link is a relative one (as is likely to be the case in a book with text boxes collected in one place. This is, however, a slight hack. Improvements are welcome!

The &quot;head&quot; of the box (i.e. the title) can be tweaked using the headType parameter, which can (if required) be set to the header levels h2, h3, h4, etc. This means that the box will appear in the TOC listing for the page. The headAlign parameter allows the head to be shifted to the right or left, as opposed the the default centred title.

The box can be further adjuested by using the &quot;color, &quot;float&quot; and &quot;width&quot; and parameters. Examples are provided below, mostly using the &quot;Lorem&quot; template

=== Examples ===
One argument (a simple box)
&lt;pre&gt;{{Code:Transclude|Lorem}}&lt;/pre&gt;
{{Code:Transclude|Lorem}}

Two arguments (a box with a title)
&lt;pre&gt;{{Code:Transclude|Box 1.2|Lorem}}&lt;/pre&gt;
{{Code:Transclude|Box 1.2|Lorem}}

A collapsible box 
&lt;pre&gt;{{Code:Transclude|Box 1.3|Lorem|collapsible= collapsible}}&lt;/pre&gt;
{{Code:Transclude|Box 1.3|Lorem|collapsible= collapsible}}

A collapsible box, hidden by default, with a left-aligned title of heading level 4
&lt;pre&gt;{{Code:Transclude|Box 1.4|Lorem|collapsible=hidden|headType=h4|headAlign=left}}&lt;/pre&gt;
{{Code:Transclude|Box 1.4|Lorem|collapsible=hidden|headType=h4|headAlign=left}}


The most complicated (and most realistic)
{{Code:Transclude|Box 1.5|Lorem
|collapsible=true
|color=#778899
|float=right
|width=25%
|headType=h5}} 
A collapsible box at the side, in a different colour
&lt;pre&gt;{{Code:Transclude|Box 1.5|Lorem
|collapsible=true
|color=#778899
|float=right
|width=25%
|headType=h5}}&lt;/pre&gt;

|Apart from numbers, perhaps the most useful named objects in R are '''functions'''. Nearly everything useful that you will do in R is carried out using a function, and many are available in R by default. You can use (or &quot;call&quot;) a function by typing its name followed by a pair of round brackets. For instance, the start up text mentions the following function, which you might find useful if you want to reference R in published work:
|citation()
|&lt;nowiki&gt;&gt; citation()

To cite R in publications use:

  Computing, Vienna, Austria. ISBN 3-900051-07-0, URL http://www.R-project.org.

{{Code:Interpreted
|lang={{:Statistical_Analysis:_an_Introduction_using_R/R/Syntax}}
|Many R functions can produce results which differ depending on '''arguments''' that you provide to them. Arguments are placed inside the round brackets, separated by commas. Many functions have one or more ''optional'' arguments: that is, you can choose whether or not to provide them. An example of this is the &lt;code&gt;citation()&lt;/code&gt; function. It can take an optional argument giving the name of an [[../R/Packages|R add-on package]]. If you do not provide an optional argument, there is usually an assumed default value (in the case of &lt;code&gt;citation()&lt;/code&gt;, this default value is &lt;code&gt;&quot;base&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. provide the citation reference for the base package: the package which provides most of the foundations of the R language).
Most arguments to a function are ''named''. For example, the first argument of the citation function is named ''package''. To provide extra clarity, when using a function you can provide arguments in the longer form ''name{{=}}value''. Thus
 citation(&quot;base&quot;)
does the same as
 citation(package{{=}}&quot;base&quot;)
If a function can take more than one argument, using the long form also allows you to change the order of arguments, as shown in the example code below.
|citation(&quot;base&quot;)      #Does the same as citation(), because the default for the first argument is &quot;base&quot;
                      #Note: quotation marks are needed in this particular case (see discussion below)
citation(&quot;datasets&quot;)  #Find the citation for another package (in this case, the result is very similar)
sqrt(25)              #A different function: &quot;sqrt&quot; takes a single argument, returning its square root.
sqrt(25-9)            #An argument can contain arithmetic and so forth
sqrt(25-9)+100        #The result of a function can be used as part of a further analysis
max(-10, 0.2, 4.5)    #This function returns the maximum value of all its arguments
sqrt(2 * max(-10, 0.2, 4.5))             #You can use results of functions as arguments to other functions
x &lt;- sqrt(2 * max(-10, 0.2, 4.5)) + 100  #... and you can store the results of any of these calculations
x
log(100)              #This function returns the logarithm of its first argument
log(2.718282)         #By default this is the natural logarithm (base &quot;e&quot;)
log(100, base{{=}}10)     #But you can change the base of the logarithm using the &quot;base&quot; argument
log(100, 10)          #This does the same, because &quot;base&quot; is the second argument of the log function
log(base{{=}}10, 100)     #To have the base as the first argument, you have to use the form name{{=}}value

|Note that when typing normal text (as in the name of a package), it needs to be surrounded by quotation marks&lt;ref&gt;you can use either single (') or double (&quot;) quotes to delimit text strings, as long as the start and end quotes match&lt;/ref&gt;, to avoid confusion with the names of objects. In other words, in R
 citation
refers to a function, whereas 
 &quot;citation&quot;
is a &quot;string&quot; of text. This is useful, for example when providing titles for plots, etc.
You will probably find that one of the trickiest aspects of getting to know R is knowing which function to use in a particular situation. Fortunately, R not only provides documentation for all its functions, but also ways of searching through the documentation, as well as other ways of getting help.

I cannot properly see this module in Firefox. The list of packages don't wrap and mess up with the table of contents. How can it be solved?

Why this chapter is not put earlier in the book?

It seems like some important packages are missing (eg multicol). Is there an explicit reason for this?

|To quit R, you can use either the function &lt;code&gt;quit()&lt;/code&gt; or its identical shortcut, &lt;code&gt;q()&lt;/code&gt;, which do not require any arguments. Alternatively, if your version of R has a menu bar, you can select &quot;quit&quot; or &quot;exit&quot; with the mouse.
|q()
|Either way, you will be asked if you want to save the workspace image. This will save all the work you have done so far, and load it up when you next start R. Although this sounds like a good idea, if you answer &quot;yes&quot;, you will soon find yourself loading up lots of irrelevant past analyses every time you start R. So answer &quot;no&quot; if you want to quit cleanly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|Is being different bad?}}

One may realize very early in life that everyone is different. For most of us as little children, our very first day of school was scary. We saw children of different gender, color, and ethnicity just to name a few.  This was just the beginning. Once we sat in class we realized that other children talked and even laughed differently than us. At a very young age we realize how different we all are. As we grow older we realize that these same differences that once scared us are the very same differences that help us coexist.

== Respecting Students who are &quot;Different&quot; ==
In the world of education, the biggest difference arises through cultural or racial differences. “Problems can occur when teachers—most of whom are white and English speakers—expect minority and limited English-language students to act and learn in a way that does not mesh with their cultures”(www.edweek.org). A Caucasian teacher may have more difficulty relating to an Asian student then she would to another Caucasian student.  For example, Susan Black writes in her article &quot;Respecting Differences,&quot; &quot;A third-grade teacher informed Mexican immigrants that their daughter was 'insecure and overly dependent.' The teacher didn't realize the parents taught their little girl to be quiet and obedient and to seek approval while working on her assignments.&quot; This is only one example of how ethnicity can be a barrier in the classroom if the teacher does not know how to keep an open-mind and respect his or her students' differences. These are serious issues because they block learning on most levels. If a teacher cannot relate to his or her students the children are less likely to take anything away from the lecture, especially if they feel the teacher is looking down on them or scolding them for things they cannot help or do not understand. When teachers step into the classroom they need to be prepared to deal with students who do not think, look, act, or speak like they do. They need to keep an open mind, and be willing to learn about their students and their differences. All students deserve to be treated with an equal amount of respect. If teachers understand their students and their differences, many barriers will be crossed and learning will be a lot more enjoyable and effective for everyone involved. 

== Respecting Teachers who are &quot;Different&quot; ==
The difference between a foreign teacher and students is, in my opinion, much greater. While, according to the article &quot;Respecting Differences&quot; teachers are &quot;overwhelmingly white and English speaking,&quot; there are some classes that are taught by a foreign teacher. The same rules apply to teachers that are ethnically different that apply to students: Respect, understanding, and open-mindedness is key. When you have a teacher who does not understand a culture and a language you have a much greater degree of difficulty. For example, a foreign teacher trying to teach Civics would more than likely be a daunting task. It is almost impossible for a teacher who has never been in the country to teach a topic such as civics. As a society, we put ourselves in a difficult position by doing such things. I will say, however, that it is not the teachers fault, since they weren’t necessarily the ones who put themselves in that particular position. However, this is a difference that, though easy to respect, is not necessarily easy to overcome.

== How Self Esteem Helps Children Respect Differences ==
Differences among the students can also take away from a student’s education. Most importantly, this process of helping students deal with each other starts from within. “When children respect themselves and others, they feel good about who they are. When children learn to value people who are different from themselves, they are better prepared to live peacefully in a diverse world.”[http://www.pbs.org] Kids who have no self worth or esteem want no part in respecting differences. It is logical to think that children who are uncomfortable with themselves are very uncomfortable with being different. However, it is also noted that those obvious differences could be an escape or a way of connecting with others.  When a child sees another who is a different race or a different ethnicity, he or she could see this as an opportunity, or a chance of making a connection with another student who, in his or her eyes, is different too. However, is it good for those children see this as a way out of their discomfort? In most peoples eyes' the answer is no.

== Special Education ==
Another major difference in education is special education. IEP’s and 504’s give some students special attention, which creates a distinct difference between students. These kids get special treatment and most of the time it is rightfully so. However, these kids are less likely to want to succeed when they have a teacher reading them a test in the classroom, or if they are wearing headphones to listen to a recorded test. What makes the situation even more frustrating is that sometimes it does not help the student. This could be because of the negativity the student may feel from the other kids, or it could be from lack of support at home. “When I ask parents how their child’s progress toward goals and objectives is being monitored and reported to them, most often the response is ‘I’m not sure’ or ‘I don’t know’”.[http://www.schwablearning.org] This is sad because we are creating many differences among children, yet we are not utilizing the choice we are making.I believe that the 504 plans are very helpful, “The concept and practice of &quot;inclusion&quot; has resulted in new challenges for teachers, administration, and parents to provide effective educational experiences for students”.[http://www.adprima.com] In doing my observation I found that one of the students was on the 504 plan and she was very embarrassed by it.  I feel that we as teachers need to stress the fact that the students are as smart as everyone, they just need a little more assistance.  The young girl felt as if she was not as smart as the rest of the class, but she was very intelligent.  Not only is it useful to the students, but to the teacher as well because it makes it easier to teach that student knowing that particular child need more attention.  If they did not have this plan, then the teacher would be holding up the rest of the class trying to make sure that that one student gets the material, but with the 504 plan it is already established when they go into that classroom.

== Conclusion ==
Differences throughout the world are prevalent, but none more so than in education. Whether it be race, gender, or education levels and capabilities, these differences remain. Differences are two fold, mainly because they could help children in so many ways yet hurt or cause them stress in  others. If we can be successful in helping today’s children understand that being different is acceptable, then we could help them see that once they appreciate themselves then we, as teachers, would be helping countless kids everyday.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Predicate Logic==

When we introduced propositional logic we argued in treating the
electrical circuit example (circuit), that a string like
&lt;math&gt;high(inv1, o)&lt;/math&gt; can be read intuitively as &quot;the output of inverter
1 is high&quot;, but then we abstracted from this internal structure of
the proposition  and further on we represented the proposition by a
simple string like  &quot;the_output_of_inverter_1_ is_high&quot;. In
the formal parts of the calculus we even assumed more abstract just a
given countable set of propositions &lt;math&gt;\{ P_1, \cdots, P_i, \cdots \}&lt;/math&gt; . Until
now, we investigated a logical language that was able to deal with
connecting these propositions,
In this section we will have a closer look into the structure of
propositions. We will be able to explicitly refer to ''objects'' like
the inverter &lt;math&gt;inv1&lt;/math&gt; or its output &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; in the sentences of our
language,. Besides this ''domain'', we will introduce the new concept
of a ''variable'', which stands for an arbitrary object of our domain.
Hence, we will be able to write e.g. &lt;math&gt;high(x, o)&lt;/math&gt; to denote the fact
that the output of a &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is high.  As a consequence of this concept
we will have ''quantifiers'', which allow for sentences like &lt;math&gt;\exists x
\; high(x,o)&lt;/math&gt;, with an intended meaning that there exists an
object &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, whose output &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; is high, or &lt;math&gt;\forall x \; high(x,o)&lt;/math&gt;
with an intended meaning that for all objects &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; output &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; is
high,

Together with these new concepts it will be possible to express rather
abstract properties of elements from the domain. Assume, e.g. that we
want to introduce the concept of elements in a circuit to be
connected. We could say &lt;math&gt; connected(inv1, inv2)&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;connected(inv2, inv3)&lt;/math&gt;. Now, with the intended meaning of being
connected, we can assume, that &lt;math&gt;inv1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;inv3&lt;/math&gt; are connected as
well. Of course, we could introduce the new sentence &lt;math&gt;connected(inv1,
inv3)&lt;/math&gt; to express this; but the disadvantage is obvious: this have to
be done for all objects from our domain. In predicate logic this
property of transitivity of connectedness can be expressed without
referring to explicit objects by the following sentence:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 
\forall x \forall y \forall z  ((connected(x,y) \land connected(y,z) ) \to
connected(x,z)) 
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Syntax==
==Definition 1 (Syntax of predicate logic - Terms)==

Assume a 
  
*countable set of function symbols &lt;math&gt;\{ f{_i}^k \mid i,k =1,2,3,\cdots \}&lt;/math&gt;    
*a countable set of &lt;math&gt;\{ x_i \mid i = 1,2,3, \cdots\}&lt;/math&gt;  
The set of terms is defined by the following induction:
  
*Variables &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are terms. 
*If &lt;math&gt;t_1, \cdots, t_k&lt;/math&gt; are terms and &lt;math&gt;f_i^k&lt;/math&gt; is a function symbol,  then &lt;math&gt;f_i^k(t_1, \cdots, t_k)&lt;/math&gt; is a term. 

Terms of type &lt;math&gt;f_i^0()&lt;/math&gt; are special ones, they are called constants. In this case we omit the braces and denote them 
as &lt;math&gt;f_i^0&lt;/math&gt;.

Terms are the syntactic counterpart of the above mentioned objects. 
Constants will denote the elements of the domain and function symbols
will denote a way to refer to such objects.

The following definition introduces the formulae.

==Definition 2 (Syntax of predicate logic - Formulae)==

Assume a countable set of predicate symbols&lt;math&gt; \{ p_i^k \mid i =
1,2,3, \cdots\} &lt;/math&gt;. 
The set of (well-formed) formulae is
defined by the following induction:
  
*If &lt;math&gt;t_1,\cdots, t_k&lt;/math&gt; are terms and &lt;math&gt;P_i^k&lt;/math&gt;  is a predicate   symbol, then  &lt;math&gt;P_i^k(t_1, \cdots, t_k)&lt;/math&gt; is a formula. 
*If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are formulae, then &lt;math&gt;(F\land G)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(F\lor G)&lt;/math&gt;   are formulae. 
*If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a formula, then &lt;math&gt;\lnot F&lt;/math&gt; is a formula. 
*If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a variable and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; a formula, then &lt;math&gt;\forall x F&lt;/math&gt; and    &lt;math&gt;\exists x F&lt;/math&gt; are formulae. 
Formulae of type  &lt;math&gt;P_i^k(t_1, \cdots, t_k)&lt;/math&gt; are called atoms
or atomic formulae.

Note that the concept  of subformulae applies exactly like in the
propositional case ([[Logic for Computer Scientists/Propositional Logic/Syntax|Syntax (Propositional Logic)]]).

We introduce the following abbreviations, which will be used with
indices as well:

{|
!
!
!
!
!
|-
|&lt;math&gt; u,v,w,x,z,  &lt;/math&gt; 
|||          
|for variables
|-
|&lt;math&gt; a,b,c, \cdots&lt;/math&gt;            
|||
|for constants
|-
|&lt;math&gt;f,g,h, \cdots &lt;/math&gt;            
|||
|for function symbols 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;p,q,r, \cdots&lt;/math&gt;             
|||
|for predicate symbols
|}
&lt;br&gt;
Note the the arity of function and predicate symbols is ommited in
these abbreviations; we assume that it will be obvious from the
context.

'''Example:''' Assume we want to represent the following equation, which holds for
arbitrary elements in a field:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
x * (y + z) = x*y +x*z
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The two operators &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; are represented in a predicate logic
formula as binary function symbols &lt;math&gt;f_1^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_2^2&lt;/math&gt;, the three
variables are &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt;, and the equality relation &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; is
the binary predicate symbol &lt;math&gt;P_1^2&lt;/math&gt;. Altogether we have the
following formula in predicate logic:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\forall x_1 \forall x_2 \forall x_3 (P_1^2(f_2^2(x_1, f_1^2(x_2,x_3)),
f_1^2(f_2^2(x_1,x_2), f_2^2(x_1,x_3))))
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In the following we will use the obvious and more liberal notation as
in the propositional case.

==Definition 3==
An occurrence of a variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in a formula &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is called bound, if it  occurs in a subformula of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; which is of
the form &lt;math&gt;\exists x \;G&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \forall x\;G&lt;/math&gt;. Otherwise we call the occurrence free.

A formula, which does not contain a free occurrence of a variable is
called closed.

'''Example:''' The following formula contains both free and bound occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\forall z(Q(z) \land \forall x(P(x,y)) \lor \exists y(P(x, y)))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

* The silence is suddenly broken by a hush.
* The Jackson twins were seen riding to town alone in their car, with Phil in the middle.
* If something is beautiful, it is also valuable.
* Some birds do not build nest.(Myers, R.E., Torrance, E.P., 1970, p.19-21)
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Are these statements reasonable or unreasonable? That question was asked of each student in Mrs. Platt’s fifth grade classroom, followed by a moderated group discussion about the topics.  Having an open discussion required the students to see things from different points of view.  Getting her troublesome student, Gertrude, to stand up front and moderate the conversation, helped get Gertrude engaged in the classroom and made her gain a new respect for the teacher (Myers, R.E., Torrance, E.P., 1970).  Is it important for students to learn creativity, and working with abstract ideas, like Mrs. Platt tried to do? What are the benefits of this type of learning, and if any, how do we test it?
  
==Importance of Creativity and Teamwork==
{{Rquote|right|Thank goodness I was never sent to school; it would have rubbed off some of the originality.|Beatrix Potter}}

It is of course hoped that experiences in creative thinking at their own level will help students develop a characteristic way of looking at things that will, for some individuals, ultimately result in the creation of ideas and products that are truly original and useful for the culture at large (Osborn, 1963, Cited: Ford, B.G, Renzulli, M.J., 1976).  In life, being creative and looking at abstracts from numerous perspectives is imperative.  Not only does working creatively with teams help children maneuver through life, but it will be a tool needed in many of the areas they choose to work after high school and in college. 
===Preparation===
{{Rquote|right|The starting point of all science and all inquires is, 'I wonder why...'|(Egan, K., 2005, p.80)}}
In countless professions, such as marketing, entertainment, science, engineering, and entrepreneurship, thinking “Outside of the box” is necessary for success.  There is a good deal of research evidence which shows that persons who have engaged in systematic creativity training exercises can be expected to increase their capacity for creative thinking in a variety of fields (Osborn, 1963, Cited: Ford, B.G, Renzulli, M.J.,1976). There have been special teachers throughout the years, that we (Generation X, Y, and M) can remember, that used creative projects and student-centered work to teach our classes. But at one time student-centered work was rare, and teacher lead direct style teaching was dominant in the schools. You will still find direct style teaching within the classroom today.  This can be a classroom mangagement or control issue.  If a lesson is well thought out, the teacher can incorporate creative group work and still be able to maintain classroom control. The extra time spent to prepare equipment and special lessons are worth the effort.  Studies have shown students retained more of what they learned when they were actively involved in assignments. This suggest Student-centered and hands-on lessons can be more productive than teacher-centered lessons.  Rob Sternberg, a Yale Psychology professor, came up with the “Rainbow Project” which provided a supplementary test of analytical, practical, and creative skills to augment the SAT in predicting validity for college GPA relative to high school GPA and the SAT and decreased ethnic-group disparities in test scores (Cavanagn, S., 2003).  His premise is the belief that the SAT, measures primarily memory and analytical ability, rather than creative or practical skills.  He has also come up with the “Aurora Project” that uses creativity and problem solving to identify gifted students. WIC, acronym for Wisdom, Intelligence, and Creativity- which was also designed for college admissions offices to use to assess a student in a way that is beyond just academics.  WIC suggest attributes like good citizenship and positive leadership should be considered along side grades and test scores (Sternberg, R.J., 2007).  Since college admissions incorporate creative, practical, and elaborative thinking, shouldn’t we as teachers at primary levels, teach and prepare our students with those skills?

===Equalization===
One study called “Effects of Cooperative Learning and Perceived status of Male and Female Pupils” found varying results, depending on if the students were put in groups with or without having designated roles for each student.  When put into groups to work on a problem solving project with no assigned duties for each team member, the male students tended to dominant the team overtime and the female students played less of a role in the decisions of the team. But once teams were divided and each person had a part to contribute to the team, an equalizing effect occurred.  When the students had to cooperate to accomplish the task, overtime there were no significant differences between female and male group members in achievement, verbal participation, perceived leadership, and status(Peterson, R.P., p.717-735).  This study proves, that teamwork with individual accountability is crucial for developing critical thinking and problem solving skills among boys and girls.  Another study, called PACER, done among a 6th grade Physical Education classroom, found when working in teams low skilled students performed as well as their average and highly skilled counterparts. The study also found that cooperative efforts resulted in higher achievement on higher level learning task, than individualistic efforts did. As well, engaging in and receiving verbal comments are significantly related with achievement (Barrett, T., 2005).

===Peer Acceptance===
Besides bridging gender boundaries and higher achievement, teamwork and cooperative learning can also facilitate peer acceptance of students with disabilities.  Studies have shown problem solving and group work create confidence among diverse types of students. That is why a set of alternative instructional methods, called CL, were developed.  CL stands for Cooperative Learning.  With CL, students, in general and special education settings, work in small groups to help one another learn academic material (Johnson, 1981; Kagan, 1992; Slavin, 1995).  CL has demonstrated academic gains.  For instance, it increased student achievement and social gains, such as improved inter group relations, acceptance of academically handicapped classmates, and increased self esteem (Johnson et al, 1981).  So as we can see, creative and collaborative learning not only help students learn, but can also help with social acceptance issues, and confidence.

==Lesson Plans==
{{Rquote|right|Good teaching is more a giving of right questions than a giving of right answers.|Josef Albers}}

Incorporating creative and abstract thinking into lesson plans engages the students.  It can change:

*Troublesome behavior into outstanding performance 
*Apathy to enthusiasm about learning 
*Lack of self expression to creative self expression
*Non-reader to average or superior reader (Myers, R.E., Torrance, E.P., 1970)

Since we now know creativity, working with abstracts, and teams are essential to a well rounded student; how should we create lesson plans and test to incorporate it into the classroom?  In order for students to reap the benefits of thinking abstract, teachers must be creative themselves while making up their lesson plans, quizzes, and test. Lesson plans should work up to the test. For teachers the creative process should start when brainstorming and writing lesson plans and exams. Some suggest writing your final exam first, then writing the lesson plans to incorporate everything that you want your students to retain from the semester(Bartel, Marvin, 2006). Think about what your objectives for the class are, then add the imaginative formats for teaching them. Adding versatility in your lesson plans by using technology, skits, and team projects, keeps the students attentive. There are no longer any excuses to have pupils just sitting listening to a boring lectures everyday!

==Testing==
One format for testing abstract thinking can be open ended questions, which are questions with no real definite answer. You can give higher grades for less ordinary answers.  These questions can allow the student to elaborate.  In the “Rainbow Project” students were asked to write 2 stories, taking 15 minutes each, based on a list of fictitious titles.  A team of judges rated those stories on originality, evocativeness, complexity, and descriptiveness.  In another section, the students were given cartoons from the New Yorker and were asked to write captions for them (Cavanagn, S.,2003).  
Various categories you can test are logical reasoning, ideational fluency, spontaneous flexibility, originality, elaboration, redefinition, sensitivity to problems, and judgment (Myers, R.E., Torrance, E.P., 2007). Torrance's Tests of Creative Thinking, is highly recommended in the educational field. You can use these pre-formatted test as a guide, or you can be clever and invent your own.  See [http://www.goshen.edu/~marvinpb/arted/testing/drawtest.html goshen.edu] for ideas.

One benefit of making up your own test, is you can formulate team test. On example of assessing cohesiveness, &amp; problem solving skills within teams could be: a class projects which requires each team member to find a piece of a puzzle in order to find the final answer. This could be used in a history class with historical facts on each piece or in English with different quotes on each section from one author.  Then when the teams fit together the completed puzzles, they would reveal a shape or picture of something representing a major event in time or the outline of something representing the author. Then the students can guess, which event the picture, along with all the cumulatively individual facts on each piece represents. The teams that put the puzzles together and come up with the answer in the fastest time bracket get As, and second fastest bracket Bs, and so on down. You can make the clues more difficult for higher grade levels. Determining standards for each grade will be decided beforehand, providing the teacher with a guide to grade upon.  The students should also know in advance the requirements and how the project will be graded.  In addition, teachers can calculate in participation points for each individual’s contribution within the group.

==Conclusion==
With so many resources available to teachers today, the sky is not the limit for creativity in the classroom.  I challenge you to expand your student’s minds. Press them to see perspectives bigger than themselves.  Being creative might take more time to plan, but the end product will be well worth it.  Who knows you might grow and learn something new yourself.

{{question-answer|question=What is one bad, and one good example of including creativity and imagination into lesson plans within your field of teaching?
|answer=My field of study is Physical Education. Unfortunately, my field sometimes has a bad reputation, because of unoriginal teachers.  Tragically, we can all probably remember our P.E. teachers giving us a ball and saying just practice shooting for the today, and giving no further instruction.  When you have done that the last five classes, it is not exciting, unless you just love shooting hoops.  Even still, that would not be a new or challenging lesson to learn.  Instead the teacher should add some flare to awaken their students!  For example, put the students into a multi-skill level group of three.  Have them dribble and pass with their group on the way up to the basket and shoot.  The groups should work on designing inventive passing and shooting sequences.  They can add props to dribble around (a chair) or jump over (a short cardboard box), if they would like.  Remind them to be safe.  Let everyone know, what they come up with will be presented toward the end of class, and their peers will score each group 1-10 for creative style points.  1 being the least original, and 10 being the most imaginative. Having the students present this to the class will motivated the them to work hard to succeed. Participation, final product, and style points will all be factored in for a quiz grade. &amp;mdash;Barrett
----
Project based learning is an excellent way to encourage children to use creativity, imagination and communication skills while learning concepts in a meaningful manner. Instead of the traditional lesson style where teachers lecture from the board and students memorize exact facts, which are quickly forgotten, projects are created that allow students to explore and learn about a topic. In project based learning a team is given specific guidelines about the project and group roles are assigned. For example in a second grade lesson on magnets students may perform different experiments in small groups. Team members are assigned roles of leader, experimenter, recorder and materials coordinator. Each job has specific responsibilities, one person collects the needed materials, another does the experiment and the recorder writes down the data. Then as a group the children discuss their findings and present them to class. In this way children learn that magnets have north and south poles, what objects magnets are attracted to and ways to increase and decrease the strength of a magnet. Students have learned the information in a more fun and meaningful manner; this translates into higher test scores and an ability to apply their knowledge later. &amp;mdash;Shirley}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What is the role of Advanced Placement and the International Baccalaureate in creating national standards?}}

National standards play a critical role in today’s educational community. These standards shape what is taught to students, and how teachers teach. When developing national standards it is necessary to examine every view of education. This includes advanced programs including Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate.

==National Standards Ideals==
In today’s education world there is a constant battle to decide what should be taught to students. Each different branch of education has a customized way of forming ideals upon which to focus teaching. Among the top programs in the American school system are the Advanced Placement program, and the International Baccalaureate program. When creating national standards these programs must be held in high regard. Not only do the highest high school students participate in this program, the teachers, with considerable extra training, show a true display of care for the students. Once these programs are looked upon intently national standards can be formed which challenge both teacher and student, and ultimately advanced education on a national basis.

==International Baccalaureate Standpoint==
The IBO states that educational standards are a key part in the development of sound students and teachers(IBO.org). In this regard IB provides an excellent base for national standards. The standard IB student completes a rigorous program, and is constantly challenged on every level. While the students travel through the program they are forced to meet objectives and solve problems accordingly. Within the IB program students reach above and beyond what is typically expected. Students learn on various levels, and are challenged accordingly in each area. As students advance in the program areas begin to overlap, and students are given the opportunity to understand how each subject area affects the others. With this overlap students understand how the learning system s not separate parts, but one giant unit. National standards which require students to be challenged, and reach above in beyond are constantly being discussed in America’s various educational communities.

Chris Fischer states “the International Baccalaureate Theory of Knowledge program provides students a complete view of education.” In this class students have the chance to examine each area of education. Students begin to realize that while learning is different for each area, the basic methods used are the same. While students learn of each area they begin to realize that the standards affecting each intertwine. They are also given the chance to examine the various ways of knowing. In examining the various ways of knowing students maintain an understanding of education as a whole. In this way students are pushed to understand how each content area interacts. Within each way of knowing is an intermittent part of the others. Each area in and of itself directly affects the others. Once students understand the standards of how these ways of knowing work they achieve a better understanding of their learning experience. These standards which can be transferred directly to the national system enhance the learning experience. In this portion of the program students begin to breakdown the walls that divide learning, and view the educational instrument as a whole. Through this portion of the International Baccalaureate program students understand that each standard directly affects the others.

==Advanced Placement Standpoint==
Looking upon the other side of the spectrum the Advanced Placement program also provides students an excellent chance to develop themselves on a higher level. In this aspect students once again are given the chance to develop standards which lead to their betterment. In the Advanced Placement program students are given college level work, and upon completion given the chance to receive college credit for their efforts. Since these advanced students are learning on a college level they are exposed to college-level material. Being that national standards must push the envelope in the world of education, it is pivotal for advanced placement to play a role in the creation of these standards. As students study in the AP program they are constantly forced to look outside the box, and approach problems full circle.  This skill proves to be vital in the forming of any type of national standard. When education is concerned students must be pushed from all sides to form a complete package. If they are allowed to only approach problems from the most obvious viewpoint they are denied the experience of seeing problems through. Also they do not gain the chance to observe these from different angles, and achieve solutions which shy away from the norm. More often than not educational problems can’t be solved with the most obvious solution. By taking the Advanced Placement outlook students see problems in different way, and thus find more complete solutions.

National standards have always been a key part of education. In every educational community standards vary, and students learn slightly differently. However this strategy proves to be incomplete, and leads to varying educational levels across the country. In viewing this problem it is easily understood that some national standards need to be established in order to give a more complete educational plan. With both the International Baccalaureate and Advanced Placement programs students are challenged to be better than they currently are. Within this view we can see that national standards should be shaped around these programs. Not in that each student will be of the caliber of advanced students, but that students should be challenged in order to form complete views and ideals. When standards are made that require students to reach inside themselves, the ultimate result is students that are better than before. These standards create students who not only solve problems, but understand the issues surrounding the problems.

==Conclusion==
In the creation of national standards teachers and students must understand that these advanced programs provide a brilliant base upon which to build any educational program. Students who are taught with these standards develop as complete packages in the world’s eye. Teachers who teach with these standards not only better students, but better themselves. In teaching on a higher level, in reference to advanced programs, teachers inspire students, and provide a much needed advancement in the national educational standard. Students pushed to be better themselves ultimately become people who push for a better tomorrow. In establishing a national standard largely influenced by advanced programs there can only be an improvement in education as a whole. With teachers and students constantly pushed to better themselves the entire nation will improve.

{{question-answer|question=What are some similarities and differences between the Advanced Placement program and the I.B. program?
|answer=The AP and IB programs share a few similarities, but for the most part differ greatly. In terms of similarities, both programs ask a lot of the participants. There is a lot of information absorbed in one term of each course. Also teach course culminates in final examinations prepared by a board of educators. Each exam can warrant college credit for high enough scores. However, AP classes are simply a string of classes that a student has the freedom to pick and choose from. One can take AP Spanish and AP biology, but opt to take regular United States History. There is no particular track to follow. Also The student has the option to withhold AP grades from being sent to the various colleges to which he or she may apply. The IB program is quite a different animal. It is a strictly structured diploma program that (in the U.S.) begins in the freshman year of high school and delineates all of the courses that the student will attend. There are specific course requirements to fulfill the diploma. There are also specialty requirements such as a mind-expansive course called “Theory of Knowledge.” The students of the Diploma program must pen a 4,000 or more word essay within one of their subjects. Also in regards to the IB tests, they are much longer than the AP tests. In conclusion, there are many differences between the two programs in terms of implementation and results. &amp;mdash;Andréa Gomez}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What are the different concepts of intelligence?}}

You are intelligent.  Doesn’t that make you feel good about yourself?  Intelligence is a highly valued quality that most people desire.  But what exactly is it?  Where does it come from?  How is it measured?  And most importantly for us, how does intelligence apply in the world of education?  This article will address all of these questions.

==What is Intelligence?==
===Definition===
Encarta Encyclopedia defines intelligence as a “term usually referring to a general mental capability to reason, solve problems, think abstractly, learn and understand new material, and profit from past experience(1).” Britannica Encyclopedia defines it as the “ability to adapt effectively to the environment, either by making a change in oneself or by changing the environment or finding a new one(2).”  Even these definitions, found in widely accepted encyclopedias, are different from each other.  Even if we suggest that the general American public would agree on the definition of intelligence, many scholars and researchers have differing opinions.  As of yet, experts have not fully agreed on one particular definition of intelligence.  Many questions remain as to the qualities, origins, and measurements of intelligence so a consensus is difficult and unlikely.  

===Cultural Considerations===
At a fundamental level, many disagree as to whether intelligence is a general mental ability or if it varies between cultures.  We know that different cultures value different things as representing intelligence (1).  North American society values mathematical and verbal skills as intelligence markers while some seafaring cultures in the South Pacific value spatial and navigational skills(1).  This article will not focus on cultural issues in intelligence, but it is worth noting that differences between cultures do exist and should be considered when assessing intelligence and intelligence tests.

==How is Intelligence Measured?==
===Galton===
Interest and research on intelligence began in the late 1800’s with the work of Sir Francis Galton who began to test people on qualities such as fame, awards, reaction time, and body proportions (1).  James Cattell soon followed Galton’s ideas and developed over 50 tests that were intended to measure basic mental ability (1).

===Stanford-Binet Test===
The first intelligence measurement to predict school success was spurred on by the French government, looking for an objective way to determine which students were capable of formal schooling and which classified as mentally retarded and would need remedial help.  As a result, French psychologists, Binet and Simon, developed a test measuring practical knowledge, memory, reasoning, vocabulary, and problem solving (1).  Binet’s test was revised by Stanford psychologist, Lewis Terman and published in the United States as the Stanford-Binet test(1).  

===IQ===
Terman first coined the term Intelligence Quotient (IQ) as one score which was a function of mental age divided by chronological age.  While the term IQ is still used, it does not refer to the same equation.  Modern IQ tests determine a person’s score based on the standard deviation (difference from the average person of that age) (1,2,6).

Currently used IQ tests include the Stanford-Binet, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (Kaufman-ABC) (1).  Individual IQ tests are expensive and time-consuming, and they can only be administered by specially trained psychologists.  Group IQ tests, such as the Otis-Lennon School Ability Test and the Cognitive Abilities Test are more cost-effective and consequently are often used in schools (6).

==Different Theories on Intelligence==
===The “g factor”===
Charles Spearman developed an early intelligence theory that involved a general factor, often referred to as the “g factor”.  The g factor was considered to be the underlying mental ability that would influence performance on any intelligence test (1).  

===Primary Mental Abilities===
As the g factor was questioned, the next idea was a theory of primary mental abilities, specific to different areas of ability, including verbal comprehension, verbal fluency, number, spatial visualization, inductive reasoning, memory, and perceptual speed (2).

===Fluid Intelligence and Crystallized Intelligence===
Fluid intelligence is the biological basis of intelligence, involving reasoning ability, memory capacity, and speed of information processing (1,6).  Crystallized intelligence involves the knowledge and skills gained through learning (1,6).  Since crystallized and fluid intelligence are both measured on most intelligence tests, they are correlated with each other.  Consequently, some see this theory as supportive of Spearman’s g factor.

===Multiple Intelligences===
{{Rquote|right|It’s not how smart you are, it’s how you’re smart!|(4)}}

Recently, there has been an increased focus on the idea of different areas of intelligence(6).  In 1983, Howard Gardner proposed a concept of intelligence that includes eight separate intelligences: logical-mathematical, linguistic, musical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalist.  This theory of Multiple Intelligences was not focused on IQ tests but rather on explaining the wide range of abilities that people display(6).  

The many critics of Gardner’s theory point to his lack of formal measurements for the separate intelligences, little supporting scientific data, and a negligence of the previous, well-established research suggesting the presence of a g factor(1,5,6,7).  Despite all the criticism, the theory of Multiple Intelligences was widely accepted among educators because it gave a new perspective on the way school should be done(5).  Perhaps the “slow”, low-achieving students simply weren’t given the right opportunities to display their intelligence in areas other than the subjects traditionally emphasized in school.  This expanded the concept of intelligence and suggested the possibility that the traditional curriculum was much too limited.  Some schools have attempted to design and implement curricula that assess and develop all eight of Gardner’s multiple intelligences (1).

Some teachers have assessed the effectiveness of their own classroom activities by analyzing how many of the multiple intelligences are addressed in each activity (3).  If an activity involves linguistic, spatial, and bodily-kinesthetic intelligences, then it would be considered more effective than an activity that only measures logical-mathematical intelligence.

===Triarchic Theory===
The triarchic theory is a demonstration of the cognitive perspective of intelligence, focusing on how people use their intelligence (6).  Developed by Robert Sternberg, the triarchic theory of human intelligence suggests three types of intelligence: analytical, practical, and creative (6).

===Emotional Intelligence===
Emotional intelligence “consists of the ability to perceive and express emotion, assimilate emotion in thought, understand and reason with emotion, and regulate emotion (6).”  The concept of emotional intelligence was developed in 1990 by Salovey and Mayer, and popularized in 1995 when Daniel Goleman wrote a best-seller entitled Emotional Intelligence. Goreman credited EQ for being 80% responsible for the amount of success an individual will have in their lifetime, with the remaining 20% being dependent upon IQ.  Professor Chan Chieh has defined the five major qualities of EQ as being “self awareness, mood management, self-motivation, impulse control and interpersonal skills”.  The Multifactor Emotional Intelligence Scale (MEIS) is the most empirically supported of many emotional intelligence tests (6).

EQ and IQ are not dependent upon one another.  They also differ in the fact that an individual’s EQ can be “nurtured and significantly strengthen and it is never too late for students to improve.” (Chieh)  The challenge as a teacher is to foster that development in a traditional classroom. One option is to have allotted periods or courses that concentrate on self-study or personal awareness.  Another option, that is far easier to implement within existing curriculum, is group work.  Group is especially effective in EQ development when it is designed to promote creative thinking and intuition.
 
==Origins of Intelligence: Nature vs. Nurture==
The debate as to whether genetic factors or environmental factors are responsible for intelligence has gone on for many years(1,2).  Many studies, particularly twin studies, point to the influence of genetics while many other studies, including adoption studies, environmental deprivation and enrichment studies, and home environment studies point to the influence of environment on intelligence (6).  Both nature and nurture have been scientifically established to have a significant impact on intelligence.  The exact percentages of influence can be estimated, but it is clearly a complex formula involving both genetic influences and environmental influences.

==Why is Intelligence Important to the Field of Education?==
{{Rquote|right|While the debate goes on in specialized and scholarly publications, there is little doubt that the idea of Multiple Intelligences has become part of the way educators and ordinary folks see the world.|(5)}}

As educators, we must be aware of the different theories on intelligence because they influence the way we see, teach, and test our students.  That’s not to mention the fact that intelligence theories can influence the entire school system, as we have seen with Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences.  As teachers and administrators, we must acknowledge the influence of both nature and nurture so that we can be sensitive to children’s biological capability and also determined to teach them well and push them to their highest potential.  It is not necessary that we all agree on which theory of intelligence to adopt, but we must remain open to different concepts of how children’s minds work.  We all desire to teach well and to positively influence our students.  Being aware of intelligence theories can help us do that effectively so that we know how we might reach our students and tap into their potential.

{{question-answer|question=How should teachers use their knowledge of intelligence theories in the classroom?
|answer=Teachers should use intelligence theories to improve their teaching and testing through trial and error.  Since there is so much debate of the official definition of what intelligence is and how it should be measured, teachers should use the theories as platforms to try different methods.  For example, a teacher exploring the use of Multiple Intelligences in his classroom might attempt to assign tasks that would tap into several of Gardner’s eight intelligences.  The teacher might especially look to try out tasks that involve the intelligences that have not traditionally been tested in schools (all those other than logical-mathematical and linguistic).  If, after trying that out for a good period of time, the teacher finds that it is not making a difference, perhaps he would try a different approach.  In another instance, research might point to the value of group intelligence tests at the beginning of a school year.  Administrators and teachers might try this out one year to help them better know the students’ abilities in order to teach more effectively.  However, if it caused more problems or was of no benefit, they might not do it again the next year.  The most important thing is that teachers and administrators are willing to use whatever information they have in order to effectively reach the students.  Intelligence research can be a spring board for teachers to try various methods of teaching and testing.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What is the case for home schooling?}}

Given the enormous benefits and relatively inconsequential sacrifices of home schooling, one could reasonably argue that there more needs to be a case for public schooling than home schooling. However, America has had an historical propensity to question and resist anything that involves change, or that does not comply with the societal norm. Compulsory attendance laws, while initially passed with the intent of making sure every child was afforded an education, have had the effect of qualifying the institution of public school as the norm, thereby making anything other than public schooling “abnormal.” This is reinforced by the fact that any student not attending public school, including those enrolled in private schools, must by law notify their public school district of their choice to pursue an “alternative education program.” (Code of VA § 22.1-254) The monolith that is the National Education Association also propagates the sophomoric notion that public school is the only proper way to educate, and espouses these ideals in the tenets of its Code of Ethics, which states in Principle II: Commitment to the Profession that “In the belief that the quality of the services of the education profession directly influences the nation and its citizens, the educator shall exert every effort …to assist in preventing the practice of the profession by unqualified persons. In fulfillment of the obligation to the profession, the educator--5. Shall not assist a noneducator in the unauthorized practice of teaching.”   (NEA, 1975) Thanks to NCLB, the only “noneducators” that are currently engaged in the practice of teaching are uncertified parents who have chosen to homeschool. 

==Parental Rights: Father Knows Best vs. Big Brother is Watching== 

Central to the homeschooling debate is the inherent question, “Who knows what is best for each American student; their parent(s) or the public school system?” Any good parent will tell you that they know what is best for their own child, which is actually counter to the thinking among many public school officials who think they know what is best for the child: after all, public school officials have been “trained.” Author Jennifer Kaufield (2002, p.10) encourages parents, “No matter what your reasons are for wishing to homeschool your children, if they center on what’s best for your family right now, then your reasons are valid and worth pursuing. Home education is all about meeting your child’s needs.”     

===Education in America: A Historical Perspective===
{{Rquote|right|The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not the mere creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.|Supreme Court Justice McReynolds, Opinion of the Court, ''Pierce v Society of Sisters, 1925''}}

The debate surrounding homeschooling is filled with irony, literally from beginning to end. In early America, almost every child was educated due to the colonists’ desire for their children to be able to read the Scriptures, and parents saw it as their responsibility, not that of the government, to provide education. In fact, The Boston Latin School, the first school established outside the home in 1636, was formed for disadvantaged children and orphans who had no parents to educate them. (Beliles &amp; McDowell, 1989, p.102-103) This line of thinking has now been reversed, with the majority of parents placing the burden of educating their children squarely on the government.

Homeschooling was the prevalent means of formal education until the advent of compulsory public school attendance in the 1870s. (Beliles &amp; McDowell, 1989, p.102-103 and Scheuer, 2004). In 1925, the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in ''Pierce v Society of Sisters'' essentially struck down compulsory attendance laws which required ALL children to attend ONLY public schools, and guaranteed a parents right to choose their children’s form of education; be it public or private, or by modern extension, home schooled. (''Pierce v Society of Sisters'', 1925).

Homeschooling was still illegal in about half the states during much of the 20th century, but today it is legal nationwide. The current, modern wave of homeschooling is primarily associated with and driven by conservative evangelical Christians, who since the 1980s are increasingly choosing to home school their children in response to what they see as an increasingly secular, anti-Christian public school system. However, the modern home school movement was actually rejuvenated in the 1960s by Liberal parents and the anti-establishment counterculture movement, which rejected the rigid structure and conservative nature of schools at the time. One of its early proponents and pioneers was John Holt, an influential critic of mainstream education, who also happened to be...an atheist. (Scheuer, 2004) Recently, the home school pendulum has begun to swing back to the left. Although most homeschool parents define themselves as Christian, that is not necessarily the primary reason for homeschooling. According to the US Census Bureau and other sources, in 2000 only 33 percent of homeschooling parents cited religion as a reason for homeschooling (and many of these parents cited other reasons as well). On the other hand, 50.8 percent cited a belief that their children could get a better education through homeschooling, while 29.8 percent stated that school offers a poor learning environment, and 11.5 percent said that their children were not being challenged in school. (Gathercole, 2005)

===No Child Left Behind vs. My Child as a Guinea Pig===
By all accounts, the public school system is in need of major repair and overhaul. The most lauded and concurrently disdained issue in public schools today is the No Child Left Behind act. While noble in its aspirations of accountability, NCLB has now created an entirely new dynamic of problems. Passing the SOL test and meeting AYP has now become the focus of public schools because a school’s future and the livelihood of its employees literally depend on it. Many public school teachers are now out of necessity and self preservation “teaching the test.” 

“The Principle Approach” established by Noah Webster as the standard method of education using the principles of research, reasoning, relating, and recording (the “4-Rs”) has been all but forgotten in modern public schools. Until the 1920s, essays were the primary method of testing; now, most modern tests are fill-in-the-blank, multiple choice, matching, or True-False. Students can take and pass these tests for years without truly learning how to reason and think and be prepared for life after completion of school. (Beliles &amp; McDowell, p.98-100)
The truest test of knowledge is application, and all we can ascertain from NCLB is that public school students can pass a standardized test, and life, as we all know, is not standardized. With a child’s future in the balance, is it not reasonable for a parent to remove their child from this admittedly flawed system rather than sending them in and “hoping for the best?” In the past two decades the growth rate of homeschooling has increased enormously. Disillusioned parents have been pulling their children out of the secular and in many instances substandard public education system, taking education into their own hands. (Scheuer, 2004)

===Religious Freedom=== 
{{Rquote|right|Once a child has been submitted to the public schools for his education, parents lose all ability to control the course of instruction.|Michael Farris}}

In 1987, a seminal case in the arena of parental rights, ''Mozert v. Hawkins County Public Schools'', was argued before the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The case was brought by the parents of several students who were expelled because they refused to read a series of reading books that violated their religious beliefs. The suit sought to have the students re-instated and allowed an alternative reading assignment. The central issue in the case was: Do parents and children who have sincere religious objections to public school curriculum have the right to alternative instruction for the objectionable material? The answer given by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals was clear: Parents have no such right. Once a child has been submitted to the public schools for his education, parents lose all ability to control the course of instruction. (Farris, 2006)

America began as a country whose oldest and greatest institutions of higher learning, among them Harvard 1638, William &amp; Mary 1693, Yale 1701, Princeton 1746, and Rutgers 1766, were founded with the sole purpose of keeping God as the centerpiece of education. (Beliles &amp; McDowell, 1989, p.111) America has since become a country who has removed public school prayer and through the ever broadening interpretation of the “Separation of Church and State,” become increasingly secular and anti-religion. If, as a parent, you support this direction, that is your right. However, the ONLY recourse for a conscientious parent who objects to curriculum for religious reasons is to withdraw their child from public school, and if a private school alternative does not exist, the only reasonable option is homeschooling.

==Socialization==
Among veteran homeschooling circles, the issue of socialization is referred to simply as “The Question;” as in, have you been asked “The Question” yet: What about your child’s ''socialization''? Before answering this question, the term “socialization” must first be defined: is this an inquiry into a student’s ''social outlets'', or into the more abstract concept of  ''assimilation into society''? (Kaufield, 2002, p 29)

===Social Outlets: Homeschoolers Aren’t Locked in the Dungeon!===
Contrary to popular belief, homeschoolers are often engaged in MORE social outlets than their peers. In part because they receive individualized instruction, they often complete and master their school work in a fraction of the time required in public school. In addition, their often flexible schedule allows for more extracurricular activities. The number of clubs, activities, and social outlets is so numerous, that parents of homeschoolers often need to be reminded not to over-schedule their children to fulfill some nay-sayers delusion that their children aren’t being “socialized.” (Kaufield 2002, p 30, and Gathercole, 2005)

===Assimilation into Society===
{{Rquote|right|Go to your local public school, walk down the hallways and see what behaviors you would want your child to emulate.|Manfred Zysk}}

According to Manfred Zysk (1999), “One of the silliest and most annoying comments made to homeschooling parents is, &quot;Aren't you concerned about how your child will be able to socialize with others?&quot; What is being implied here is that the homeschooled child is some kind of introverted misfit who cannot relate to other people, children, and the outside world. In reality, most of the homeschooled children that I have known and met are not only outgoing, but polite and respectful, too. This is a sharp contrast to the public school children that I have known, who can't relate to adults and whose behavior is rude and inconsiderate…in public school, children are segregated by age, and have very little interaction with other adults, except their teacher(s). This environment only promotes alienation from different age groups, especially adults. This is beginning to look like the real socialization problem…homeschooling parents choose to homeschool for a variety of reasons, but I have never heard any homeschooling parent say that the reason they want to homeschool is to isolate their child from all of society. But, it probably wouldn't be a bad idea for homeschooled children to stay away from public school administrators, the NEA members, sociologists, and others who cannot properly &quot;socialize&quot; with children. From all of the research gathered for this article, this rather terse response sums up the general feeling of frustration felt by the majority of home school parents on the subject of socialization.  Quite simply, home schooled students are generally ''better'' adapted and socialized to society than their public school peers. (Kaufeld, 2002, p33)

==The Educational Experience==
===Athletic Clubs vs. Interscholastic Athletics===
Although many professional educators disapprove of homeschooling and claim that it limits children's exposure to peers or people of different cultures, current laws in 16 states allow homeschoolers &quot;equal access&quot; to activities like music and interscholastic sports at local public high schools. (Scheuer, 2004)  In Virginia, the Virginia High School League which governs public school athletics &amp; the Virginia Independent School Athletic Association which governs private school athletics effectively deny homeschoolers the right to participate in interscholastic sports. (personal correspondence, Zimorski, 2007, and VISAA.org, 2007) In Virginia, this is a legitimate sacrifice that homeschoolers must weigh in their decision to homeschool. If one is pursuing an athletic career, this door of opportunity is essentially closed in Virginia. However, these are not the only opportunities for an athletic career in Virginia. Certain athletic clubs more than welcome homeschoolers and in some instances their devotion to the sport requires it. Figure skating is a case in point. A home school co-op group meets at the Hampton Roads Iceplex in Yorktown, VA for figure skaters whose dreams of pursuing Olympic glory require inordinate amounts of time at the rink, which also includes classical ballet training. (personal interview, Caldwell, 2004) Other “club” sports such as ice hockey and soccer have college and professional scouts in attendance at many elite level tournaments. (personal interview, Tucker, 2007, and personal interview, Scrofani, 2004)   
Home schooling associations are growing to the point where athletic opportunities inside the national home school community are growing as well. The National Christian Homeschool Basketball Championship drew over 200 teams from 25 states to its 2003 tournament. (Scheuer, 2004) As these nationwide tournaments grow, it is only logical that more college and pro scouts will be in attendance.

===Co-ops vs. The Classroom===
Cooperatives allow groups of homeschoolers to unite and pool their resources. Often, classes will be taught by experts, professors, and/or licensed teachers for subjects ranging from science to woodshop. The classes are usually dynamic, with a focus on learning the subject matter rather than just passing the test. (homeschoolrichmond.com, 2007) 
The Commonwealth of Virginia is arguably the most historically rich state in the Union. All but forgotten in today’s NCLB/SOL crush are field trips to enhance the learning experience of public school students. Many classes are allowed only one or two field trips per year, and many more never leave the confines of the school building. Conversely, the experiential learning opportunities for homeschoolers through field trips and Co-ops are boundless. ('''''VA is for Field Trips,''''' 2007)

===Technology: The Great Equalizer===
{{Rquote|right|As cyberspace breaks down boundaries, learning no longer is confined to a desk-filled classroom with a teacher presiding in front of a blackboard.|Adam Scheuer|The Harvard Political Review, July 19, 2004}}

One of the greatest perceived hindrances to the homeschool movement is its lack of “qualified” parents fulfilling the teacher’s role. With modern technology, homeschoolers are often enrolling in college classes at a very early age.  After all, where does a child go after they have completed calculus at 12 years old? (Kaufield, 2002, p14) Cyberspace offers online courses, chat-rooms, and websites devoted to homeschooling. The teacher standing in front of the blackboard is no longer the only acceptable method of teaching. With the tremendous and varied amount of online resources available, parents are finding it easier than ever to make the decision to home school.(Scheuer, 2004) This very wikibook is a testament to the advances in technology and changes to the standard methodology used in education. Logically, one can deduce that it is much easier for a home schooled student receiving individualized and personalized instruction to access these opportunities than those limited by the classroom methodology of public schools.

===University Admissions===
Another misconception applied to homeschooling is that most colleges and universities will not accept home schooled students. That is just flat wrong. Homeschoolers are now just as likely as other students to attend college. Increasing numbers of homeschooled students are entering even the most elite universities. Harvard's acceptance rate for homeschooled applicants is about 10 percent; the same rate of acceptance as for traditionally schooled applicants. (Scheuer, 2004) In the fall of 1999, Stanford accepted 27% of homeschool applicants, nearly double the rate of traditional students. (Goldman, 2000) Higher admission rates are due in part to new, more accepting attitudes toward homeschooled applicants in college admissions offices. A January 2003 report by the National Association of College Admission Counselors in Alexandria, Virginia showed that 74 percent of colleges surveyed had formal policies to judge homeschool credentials, up from 52 percent in 2000 (Scheuer, 2004) .

In 2006, the overwhelming majority of colleges and universities now have either a dedicated homeschool admissions officer or a homeschool admissions policy. In fact, since many colleges have experienced the quality of homeschoolers they often actively pursue homeschooled students (''Homeschool Enrollment in Colleges and Universities'', 2006). The Home School Legal Defense Association has instituted a tier ratings scale for colleges and universities based on their admission policies regarding home schooled students, with Tier 1 being basically equal to the requirements impressed upon public/private school students, Tier 2 requiring a GED in lieu of a high school diploma, and Tier 3 requiring higher standards (i.e. extra testing (SAT II) or higher scores on standardized tests) for home schooled students than traditional students. The vast majority of colleges and universities in the US are rated at Tier 1, while only  Five Towns College in Dix Hills, New York, flatly denies admission to home school students (''Rating Colleges &amp; Universities by their Home School Admission Policies'', 2007)

==Conclusion==
In conclusion, making the case for homeschooling is fairly easy. It is, without a doubt, a legitimate, and more often than not, superior alternative to public school. Home schooled students consistently outperform their public schooled peers in EVERY academic area. (''Home Schooling Statistics'', 2007)  Public schooling follows the fatal flaw of credentialism; that only “certified” teachers have the ability to teach. Homeschooling’s individualized, personalized, and usually multi-faceted strategy of education simply outperforms the current methodology used by the public school system.

{{question-answer|question=What aspects of homeschooling do you see as the most beneficial?
|answer=The most important aspects of homeschooling for me would be the ability to monitor and influence what my child was taught, the ability to have my child engage in experiential learning, and the ability for my child to work at their own pace. I personally love history, but public schools have become so secularized that many of the Judeo-Christian roots of the country are ignored in modern textbooks and history lessons. There is no Christian private school that is close to where I live, so if I want to instill these facts in my child, I would have to do it myself. The prospects of experiential learning through actually visiting the historical sites would be a tremendous tool. Even though I am grown, the things I remember the most were the field trips to the local Indian reservations, Jamestown, Williamsburg, and Washington, D.C. Finally, my child is an individual, not a number. I want my child to receive all the attention they need and deserve in their education. How is a teacher with 20 plus kids the room supposed to supply individual attention, assessment, and feedback. It would be a difficult task at best. I also like the idea of my child interacting with culturally diverse people through co-ops and outside classes. I think this would help them adjust well to society in general and better prepare them for &quot;the real world.&quot;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What is the case against home schooling?}}

Tommy and Sara are both second graders and they both live in the same neighborhood. They get up every morning and attend school; however, they do not go to the same school. Tommy attends an elementary school nearby. He sits in a class with his fellow classmates, eats lunch with his friends, and plays on the swings during recess. When he comes home, he tells his parents about what he learned and how his day went. Sara, on the other hand, is learning at home. She gets up, attends a teaching session with her mom, eats lunch with her family, and plays on the computer in her room. Why did her parents choose to teach Sara at home?

According to the Webster's dictionary, home schooling is the act of learning in your own home, not at an institute. Instead of riding a bus to school and being taught by a teacher, you are taught at home with the rules and regulations created by your parent. Usually the parent is the teacher, and they choose the curriculum, pace, and instruction of the child’s learning. 

Home schooling is a rapidly growing process in the U.S. The population of K-12 students has grown from 850,000 in 1993 to 1.1 million 
in 2003 (Green 2007). The movement was developed in the 1960s and 70s in order to ?despise? public school systems, and encourage parents to seek control over their children’s education and future (Collom 2005). Though the idea began in the 60s and 70s, home schooling was not legal in all 50 states until 1993 (Green 2007). The movement has pushed more and more parents to teach their children at home, instead of at school.  

==Why Choose Home School?==
===Ideologues===
Parents in this category believe that the school system is not teaching what needs to be taught, for lack of better words. Today, the school system is trying to steer away from religious acts because of the growing diversity in the classroom. While most parents support this, others are outraged because they are not teaching religious values and character development. There becomes further difficulty with the teaching of such things as evolution or even dinosaurs because it goes against the beliefs of certain religions. A family has certain beliefs, values, and skills that they believe their children should learn. The religious belief seems to be the most influential problem when taking a child out of school and into their own home. &quot;75% of homeschool educators are conservative Christians who stress Biblical values and doctrine for their children and tend to believe that public schools are not able to teach the values they want their children to learn.&quot; (Green 2007) The school system does not practice or emphasize their certain beliefs; therefore, home schooling allows the parent to teach their religious views to their children. Also, the children may practice religion throughout the day without getting in trouble or being criticized. 

===Pedagogues===
Contrary to the ideologues, parents are not concerned with what is taught, but how the information is presented. In other words, “they believe that whatever public schools teach, they teach ineptly”(Romanowski, 2005). Pedagogues also include parents of special needs children that were not receiving what they consider to be appropriate care and education for their children. Pedagogy and special needs are the growing motivator for parents to begin home schooling (Green 2007).Teachers in the school systems are not able to look at their particular child and teach them the unique teaching style that would suit them the best. In result, home schooling will allow the parent to focus on what the child’s best learning strategy is and focus on their needs. This also gives the parent the freedom to create the curriculum and pace throughout the day.

===The Dangers===
Parents would rather teach their children at home in order to keep them safe. Who wouldn’t? These dangers include: bomb threats, drugs, large classrooms, cliques, peer pressure, bullies, etc. Keeping your child at home will not only reduce the risk, but keep them away from the exposure as well. This is home schooling motivated by fear.

==The Case Against Home School==

===Qualification===
An argument against homeschooling is the qualification of the teacher. First of all, is the parent even qualified to teach children? According to Romanowski (2001), ten states require that a parent who teaches their child have a high school diploma or equivalent. Does that mean that some parents do not have to have a high school diploma? This creates many question regarding professionalism, organization, and the teaching skills to teach their children properly and efficiently(Romanowsk, 2005). Teaching is a big responsibility and children deserve the best.

===Socialization===
Social concerns are one of the main disadvantages. A child needs to develop social skills and interact with their peers in order to succeed in life and be prepared for the real world. By being at home all the time, the child is “sheltered” from the real world and are not presented with opportunities for question, debate, or a maybe even an alternate viewpoint. The classroom offers a chance to hear different ideas, questions, interaction, and discussions(Romanowski, 2005). When being home schooled, the child can only hear the views of their parents. There are online courses the child can take, but they will never be able to experience a heated discussion. These are qualities that cannot be obtained at home. 

===Diversity===
Along with the socialization, the child does not encounter diversity. A child does not interact with diversity in their home, unless they are on a computer. Classrooms have diversity from gender, race, sex, to ethnicity. A student needs to be exposed to different beliefs and backgrounds in order to create his own original self. Even though home school children do 

===Cost===
Naturally, if one of the parents is teaching a child all day, they are not employed. Instead of making an income and paying for school, the parent is only spending money to provide the adequate education and resources. These are only a few of the items: software, videos, books, record books, paper, supplies, field trips, etc. Another cost other than money, is the cost of time. Many families lack the time to put in full responsibility and effort into the child’s education. Distractions will occur throughout the day such as:  phones ringing, baby’s crying, siblings fighting, unexpected visitors, emergencies, etc. Dodging distraction becomes a task in itself.
 
===Knowledge===
This follows up on the qualification of the parent. Does the parent know enough about a subject in order to teach it? What if both the child and the parent do not understand the subject? Or what if the child had the opportunity to excel, but the parent could not teach any further? These questions are very important to consider, because if the problem arises, then the parent will be its own bias. The parent will then be limiting their own child from furthering their education. 

==Conclusion==
In today’s world, every parent has to decide what is best for their child. Once the child is born, a common question is, where should my child go to school? An alternate option is to home school their child. With growing technology and resources, it is now becoming easier and more convenient to pick this option. It is important for parents to know the biases and especially the limitations in order to make a correct judgment on whether or not it will be best.

{{question-answer|question=The idea of Home schooling is getting better and better as technology increases. Explain to a parent why you think their child should be home schooled or be put in the school system.
|answer=Education. This is the most important word in your mind as your child develops. You want your child to be provided with the best and most efficient education there is to offer. I believe that you should place your child into the best school system that best fits him/her. There are many different schools, with different styles and techniques, to make your decision a little easier. Now keep in mind, that just like humans, no school system is going to be perfect. Each one will have factors that are misleading or frustrating, but I believe that it only makes the student stronger. Keeping your child in a school system and surrounding them with peers will only make them stronger. In order to grow, a child must learn how to solve problem, even outside of learning. Your child will see first hand what diversity is when he sits besides a classmate that is of a different ethnicity or religion. Not only will your child be able to eat lunch with their friends, but talk about what happened in class that day or how cool it was to dissect a frog!
There are many reasons why you should not teach your child at home. Not only will you have to put the time and effort in teaching, but you will also have to make sure you do everything right and at the right pace. Today, technology is catching up to us and replacing teachers at home. Instead of learning from their parents, the students will take online classes. While this is efficient, do you want your child to be stuck on a computer all day? Your child will never experience group work, or any kind of interaction with his/her peers. The main thing is preparing your child for the future, right? In order to get your child ready for the real world, they have to grow up in the real world. Pick the right school system.

Homeschooling is in my opinion only needed for extreme circumstances. If a child cannot attend public school for health reasons, or if the family is traveling etc. then homeschooling makes sense. As far as parents taking their kids out of public schools and placing them in a homeschool environment i do not support that. Yes there are problems with our school systems today but I feel that the benefits greatly outweigh the problems. Students who attend public schools are taught by professionals people who have devoted themselves to nothing other than teaching children. They have had proper training and know how to reach students. Socially students should be in the classroom. Having children interact with other children at every age is crucial. Some parents worry about their children being in that setting however when they graduate they will be dealing with those same people. I think that having a student in the public school system will make him or her a stronger individual in the long run and a more open minded individual.
----
I think that the parent should keep their child in the school system rather than have them home schooled. It would be better overall for the child and the parents.  Teachers get paid to teach students, parents do not.  I believe that the teaching should be left in the hands of professionals.  I could be a little biased because I am going to be a teacher but I would not home school my own children.  The parent’s job is to raise the child and provide food, clothes, and other necessities.  If the parent home schools their child, he or she would not have the time to work as much and concentrate on providing for the family.  Students would have a greater social life in school then at home.  They would not be as shy and they would not fear change in different situations.  Now that new teaching styles are now be implemented in the classroom of the education system, the better it is for the student to learn.  I strongly believe that the public and private education system has been placed for a reason, and I believe that if more people were home schooled then this would take more jobs away from teachers.  It would be more important to also hear what the child wants.  The parent alone should not make up his or her mind on whether or not to home school their child.  The child should have some choice on home schooling or to see his friends in public school. Home schooling is not as good as everyone makes it out to be in my opinion. &amp;mdash;Bryan Vannoy}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What is the case against vouchers?}}

Vouchers are defined as “an entitlement extended to an individual by government permitting that individual to receive educational services up to the maximum dollar amount specified. The holder can normally redeem the voucher according to the preference at any institution or enterprise approved by the granting agency.”(Swanson and King, Good) School vouchers, also known as scholarships, redirect the flow of education funding, channeling it directly to individual families rather than to school districts. This allows families to select the public or private schools of their choice and have all or part of the tuition paid (Coulson).

Vouchers have been seen throughout history in various forms like the GI Bill, food stamps, and programs like Medicare and Medicaid.(Good) Milton Friedman is considered the “grandfather” of vouchers. He first proposed vouchers but was met with political opposition. At the time public views were pro government and over time that began to change as people became suspicious of government and the role of vouchers got backing by people. “Voucher plans were frequently discussed in the 1960’s, 1970’s, and 1980’s but they never became an actual point of policy.”(Good) In the 1980s consideration for school choice became policy when Ronald Reagan became President. Attempts failed, however, with a lack of congressional support, but because of the public attention, “it had become acceptable to talk about vouchers as public policy”(Good) and in some places became actual policy.  Indeed the case of vouchers is a hot topic as some of the arguments against vouchers will be brought out. 

==Constitutionality==
The legal heart of the matter is whether the program violates the U.S. Constitution's &quot;Establishment Clause&quot; which mandates the separation of church and state and prohibits government endorsement of religion.(Miner) “Historically, public funds have not been allowed to support the cost of private education. Recent legislation and landmark court decisions have started to erode this historic barrier.”(Good) The Wisconsin Supreme Court case in June 1998 in Wisconsin ruled that the use of public funds to support private parochial schools was not unconstitutional because the court took the position that “the voucher money went to parents, not schools and thus its purpose with regard to religion, was neutral.”(Good) The United States Supreme Court refused to hear the case, letting the ruling stand. Similar cases happened in Cleveland.  Opponents of Vouchers argue that Government run voucher programs that give these funds to private schools that teach religion is a violation of the separation of church and state. “Americans must ask themselves if they feel it is right for citizens to be forced to subsidize religious education which may conflict with their beliefs” (Coulman).

==Privatization==
Vouchers are a way to provide opportunity for low-income students, in particular students of color. At the heart of the voucher movement, however, is a conservative agenda that seeks to privatize public education and funnel tax money into private schools, including religious schools. (Charney) The idea of privatization is to make schools part of the private sector and no longer government run. This was a part of Friedman’s plan. The argument is that government controlled schools are a monopoly and that if schools were to run themselves as consumer based, they would compete with eachother for higher achievement. “It is argued that because schools are legislated as a basic monopoly, they have no external incentives to be competitive. Hence, choice advocates suggest that schools will improve only if market forces are applied.”(Good) However, Henry Levin notes that competition can result in what he calls “cream skimming, or the tendency of schools to choose students from more desirable backgrounds (less poor, higher prior achievement, etc.)” He goes on to say that there is concern that “they will fail to respond to the greater needs of disadvantaged and disabled students, and that they will lead to less expensive but not more effective education for poor children.”(Levin) Also most advocates of privatization, and competition in education “are not interested in public education per se, but are simply advocates of the private sector (i.e., they want to reduce the role of government in all aspects of society).”(Good) As Levin brings out, “it is not clear how much of this interest in finding answers to difficult questions and how much is simply directed at sustaining the debate.”(Levin) Milton Friedman himself, “dismissed the notion that vouchers could help low-income families, saying &quot;it is essential that no conditions be attached to the acceptance of vouchers that interfere with the freedom of private enterprises to experiment.&quot; Vouchers were not designed to help low-income children.”(NEA) “Despite desperate efforts to make the voucher debate about &quot;school choice&quot; and improving opportunities for low-income students, vouchers remain an elitist strategy. From Milton Friedman's first proposals, through the tuition tax credit proposals of Ronald Reagan, through the voucher proposals on ballots in California, Colorado, and elsewhere, privatization strategies are about subsidizing tuition for students in private schools, not expanding opportunities for low-income children.”(NEA) 

==Results==
{{Rquote|right|We have studies of dubious relevance, focusing on outcomes we might not care much about, under conditions we do not fully understand and so from which we cannot generalize, leading to results where the interpretation depends more upon the proclivities of the analysts that the strength of the patterns of data.”|Henry M. Levin}}

Continuous research shows that studies fail to draw a comparison on the improvement in achievement when comparing voucher schools to public schools. “At present there is limited research evidence in America to support the value of vouchers improving students’ academic success in school.”(Good) The research that is there shows varied results. “those studies that showed a positive relationship between student achievement and school choice, the impact of school choice was minor, and other variables appeared to be more strongly associated with student achievement” (Good).  Even in Milwaukee, “these advocates of choice indicated that there were sufficient numbers of missing cases that one cannot craw conclusions with complete certainty. There is no dependable research evidence available in the Milwaukee data to conclude that choice has had favorable impact on student achievement.”(Good) Current programs suggest that only a very small portion of eligible families apply for available tuition vouchers. Voucher opponents cite this as evidence that dissatisfaction with public schools is not widespread, and they are probably at least partially correct. In Milwaukee, fewer than 7% of eligible families apply for the voucher program, and in Cleveland the percentage is slightly smaller and has decreased in the three years of the program. Neither voucher program has produced the mass exodus from public schools that was forecast.(Metcalf and Tait) 

==Costs==
&quot;Vouchers would further limit already tight financing that causes districts to use outdated textbooks, computers and other equipment, to increase class sizes and to scrimp on teachers.&quot; Minnesota Education Association (An NEA affiliate). Andrew Coulson believes otherwise saying “the overwhelming majority of public schools are not underfunded, including those in depressed, inner-city areas. While there are some poorly funded districts scattered around the country, low funding is not the chief cause of decaying facilities and moribund materials.”(Coulson) He does not acknowledge that part of the money that is directed towards public school is set aside for vouchers, thereby limiting the financing for school districts. Mary Zapala, a principal from Milwaukee “claimed that the public schools in Milwaukee lost millions of dollars for students who were already in parochial schools.”(Good) She goes on to say “I like competition if it is fair. What seems to be wrong with this is that the playing field is not level. We have unionized teachers, licensing rules, required assessments they don’t. We have to take everyone. They can take a kid, get the money, and if there is any misbehavior, they can send him back to us mid-year.” The 'choice' remains with the private schools that will continue to pick and choose the students they wish to accept and reject. (Coulman) In Milwaukee, “special education spending accounted for 38 percent of net new K-12 spending from 1967 to 1991. The ability of voucher schools in Milwaukee to reject students with exceptional educational needs not only enables the private schools to focus on regular education; it also requires the Milwaukee Public Schools to spend a higher share of funds on special education.”(Molnar)

==Conclusion==
The focus of Vouchers is to sidestep the real issue of making public schools better for children. Given the research, Vouchers can have its benefits and detriments. The detriments outweigh the benefits and there are no current studies to show that vouchers are working. The methods for vouchers like lottery based vouchers, laissez-faire or first come – first admitted voucher plans are a ridiculous way of administering them. They are not evenhanded because they are not given to the most deserving student. 
A 1992 Carnegie Foundation report evaluated choice programs around the country and reached the following conclusions: (1) To the extent that choice programs benefit children at all, they benefit the children of better educated parents. (2) Choice programs require additional money to operate. (3) Choice programs have the potential to widen the gap between rich and poor school districts. (4) School choice does not necessarily improve student achievement.(Molnar) Voucher programs are intended to help the poor. However, they are being misused to further a debate about “school choice” and the underlying agenda of privatizing education.

{{question-answer|question=What are the disadvantages of vouchers and do you support them?
|answer=There are many disadvantages to vouchers. They are the inequalities in which they are administered. A lottery system is not fair to low income students. This means that only few lucky students get the &quot;choice&quot; to go to another school and have their tuition paid. A laissez faire approach is not fair either. It would undermine the whole idea of vouchers because the ones that would be able to come first would be those able to apply. This would not be a fair representation. Who pays for the vouchers are the taxpayers. The same people that pay into the budget for public schools. Money for vouchers is set aside from this money so essentially taxpayers are supporting the voucher programs. With Voucher programs, students or families of the student, are given the choice to go to another school and most often that school is a private school that teaches religion. Some feel that this is a violation of the Establishment Clause because the money relegated to vouchers is supporting religion. This leaves the connotation that my tax dollars that should go  to supporting the public school system is instead supporting some other schools &quot;private&quot; religious education. For some this may violate their beliefs and in many an opinion violates the constitution. Proponents of Vouchers received backing because vouchers are partly about privatization, limiting government. It takes away from the main purpose of Vouchers which was to provide low income families with the opportunity to get a better education. I believe the focus should remain where the problems lie, Public Schools. Instead of using vouchers to enable a select few to pursue their own education at a private school, the money should be used to better the public schools. Tuition costs are high for private schools. If parents choose to take their child out of public school to send them to a private school, they should solely bare the burden of finding the financial means to do it.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What role do charter schools play in education?}}
{{Rquote|right|It is wrong to think of charter schools as a monolith.  There are schools for dropouts, schools for students who've been expelled, schools serving the most economically disadvantaged families.  Charters are as diverse as the children they educate.&quot;|Rod Paige|Former U.S. Secretary of Education}}

As future teachers, we must be prepared for all of the changes that are constantly occurring in our schools.  One major change over the last two decades is the introduction of Charter Schools.  These schools of choice are becoming more common all over the United States and many teachers are needed to fill positions in them.  But what are charter schools?  Do they work?  Will they change the face of the American school system?

==Definition==
Charter Schools are defined by the National Education Association as “publicly funded elementary or secondary schools that have been freed from some of the rules, regulations, and statutes that apply to other public schools, in exchange for some type of accountability for producing certain results, which are set forth in each charter school’s charter” (NEA.org).  This charter is a contract which outlines the school’s overall mission, including everything from the goals of their programs to the way they will assess success.  Charter schools allow students more flexibility and options than traditional public schools, a benefit that appeals to both parents and community leaders.  According to the National Study of Charter Schools, the three most common reasons for establishing a charter school are to “realize an educational vision, gain autonomy, [and] serve a special population” (uscharterschools.org).  These schools operate like traditional public schools in many ways, especially in that they cannot charge a tuition fee or levy taxes.  Their funding primarily comes from the school district and state or federal grants, although they also receive money from private sectors, such as nonprofit organizations or philanthropists.  They are also required to meet the accountability requirements of the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB).  If schools do not meet these requirements or the ones outlined in their charter they could risk being shut down by their authorizing bodies

==History of Charter Schools==
It is uncertain where exactly the idea of charter schools began.  The term could have originated in New England in the 1970s when it was proposed that teachers be given contracts or “charters” to explore new educational approaches. The nation’s first true charter school, City Academy High School, opened in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1992 after the state passed the first charter school law.  Four years later, eighteen more states had passes charter school laws and school choice was serving an extensive range of income and minority groups.  Federal support for charter schools started in 1995 with the adoption of the Public Charter Schools Program (PCSP).  According to the most recent reports, over one million students in forty states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia attend one of over 3600 charter schools.  

==Establishment of Charter Schools==
Charters are usually established “by individuals or groups based in both public and private sectors” (Vergari, 19).  When it is decided to found a charter school, several steps must be taken.  First is the exploration stage.  During this period, state laws and policies should be examined and a core founding group should be assembled.  A comprehensive school plan should also be designed.  Next, a charter should be drafted asserting the mission statement, program objectives, the financial plan and any other major details necessary.  At this point the proposal should be submitted.  If they charter is approved, there are still many steps to take.  The school must then finalize their formal operating plans and begin to recruit students and staff, including teachers and support.  Once the school has opened its doors, the job is not done.  Charter schools must continually “collect and interpret student performance data” to see how their teaching styles should be modified (uscharterschools.org).   The work of those establishing a charter school is never done, as each charter school should successfully grow and evolve.

==Benefits of Charter Schools==
One of the major benefits of charter schools, in the opinion of many, is the way that they “counteract the effects of income level on educational opportunity by establishing expanded options for lower income families that are typically available only to wealthier families who are able to buy or rent homes in neighborhoods with more desirable schools” (Okala, 314).  Charter schools are considered a voluntary alternative to court-ordered busing as a way to promote racial balance.  Due to this, charter schools serve a higher percentage of low-income and minority students than traditional public schools (although special education students are less likely to attend).  During the 2001-02 school year, approximately two-thirds of children in charter schools were minorities.    According to a study conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, about 41 percent of charter school students were of African-American or Hispanic descent, while public schools only enrolled about 32 percent of students from these groups.  In addition, charter schools enrolled 5 percent more students who received free or reduced lunches.

Next, charter schools give parents and students a much larger selection of options that they would not usually be privy to in the public school system.  These options include more choices when it comes to the curriculum, budget, and the overall philosophy held by educators, as well as input involving the teaching staff.  This can often result in more teacher and community involvement than in traditional public schools.

Charter schools are also considered ideal over traditional public schools by many of their proponents because of their system of accountability.  Charter schools operate in an almost competition like atmosphere, where their performance can influence their ability to get and keep students, receive funding from public and private ventures and can even determine whether or not they will be allowed to remain open. 
 
Many proponents endorse the innovative nature of many charter schools.  The best of charter schools “serve as laboratories for educational experimentation and innovation” (ECS.org).  Without the regulations of traditional public schools to hold them back, educators and administrators can create and put into practice new teaching and learning tactics.  

==Weaknesses of Charter Schools==
Because the concept of charter schools has been around for nearly two decades now, there has been ample time for people to realize their shortcomings.  One argument is that the opportunity for choice in education could result in the “best” students and teachers being pulled from traditional public schools (Okala, 314).  This argument is contradicted however, by an even larger negative – according to the National Education Association website, charter schools are fifty percent more likely to hire inexperienced and unqualified teachers.  In fact, while 92 percent of teachers in traditional public schools held certification, only 79 percent of those in charter schools could boast this same qualification.  

Charter schools as a whole are also not faring as well in terms of academic achievement as traditional public schools.  A case study by the United States Department of Education revealed that out of five charter schools, all five were less likely to meet state performance standards.  While over fifty percent of charter schools were meeting state standards in the 2001-02 school year, traditional public schools were slightly more successful.  A study also revealed that students from charter schools “made considerably smaller achievement gains than they would have in traditional schools” (NEA.org).  

==Beyond Charter Schools==
Although charter schools are the most prevalent of alternative schooling options, there are several other choices for those parents and students who want to learn in a different way.  One example of this is the concept of magnet schools.  A magnets school is a “public school that caters to students who are interested in certain academic subjects or who are interested in the arts” (Families.com).  Unlike charter schools, many magnet schools require certain qualifications to enroll – this includes entrance exams, some of which are extremely difficult or minimum grade-point-average requirements.  Oftentimes there are not enough spots for students in magnet schools, so those allowed in are chosen by a lottery.  For example, The School of International Studies at Meadowbrook in Norfolk, Virginia, places their curriculum on the study of world cultures, languages, and military science.  When a student enrolls, they choose one theme on which to focus, much like one would do in a college environment.  Among the many requirements for enrollment at Meadowbrook, students must pass all of their fifth grade Standards of Learning exams and have at least a C+ average, plus must endure a sometimes lengthy lottery process.  

Another choice for those wishing for alternative schooling options is homeschooling.  Though homeschooling is quite controversial, it is a popular method.  According to Homeschool.com, it is the “most flexible and diverse educational optional available today.”   The advantages of homeschooling are strengthened family bonds and the flexibility that students are allowed.  Disadvantages include the loss of income, as one parent must stay home to educate the children and a lack of confidence in their ability to teach or how well their children are learning.  While homeschooling has its advantages and disadvantages it is one of the most popular methods of alternative schooling.

==Conclusion==
Charter schools are still in the somewhat early stages of their development, so it is far too early to decide whether or not they are a great idea or just another fleeting moment in American education.   The academic results of them are widely varied and the topic sparks debate nearly any time it is brought up.  While it may be a long time before we know whether or not charter schools are here to stay, we as future teachers must be aware of what they are and how they can have an impact on us and the students we will one day teach.

{{question-answer|question=As a future educator, does teaching in a charter school appeal to you?  Why or why not?
|answer=As a future educator, I would be very interested in teaching in a charter school.  My primary reason is that I believe that being in a charter school, I would be able to more easily implement the different teaching methods I learned about in college.  It seems that in traditional public schools, teachers are expected to stick to tried-and-true methods of teaching, while charter schools allow a greater variety in the way you can teach your class.  I think that as a college student I am being exposed to ideas and technologies that veteran teachers may not have been exposed to or may be hesitant to use because they are unfamiliar with them.  Another reason I would like to teach in a charter school would be the idea of accountability.  I feel that knowing that your school’s success hinges on the success of each class would make both students more eager to learn and teachers more likely to try whatever they can to help their students.  Personally, I would be embarrassed if my school was closed down due to low achievement and ebullient if my school was commended as an example of great education.  For these reasons I think teaching in a charter school would be a rewarding and exciting opportunity.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can we construct effective measurements, including exams?}}

Ask any high school student what his or her goals regarding school are, and the answer will most likely have something to do with grades; these answers will vary from “I just want to pass” to “I want to make an A” to the most ambitious “I want to be valedictorian.”  All of these replies point to this one simple truth in high school, that it is all about the grades, and this, in turn, means that it is all about the assessment.  The problem is, school should be about learning, not having fantastic test-taking skills or a stellar ability to perform well on homework assignments, so the tricky part is left up to teachers: how to construct effective measurements of student abilities and learning.

==Use a Variety of Measurements and Accommodate All Learners==
I asked Dr. Chris Mason, the principal at the private boarding high school where I teach, what kinds of assessments he thinks teachers should use in their classrooms.  He listed, “observations of students, verbal assessments, written assignments, (and) portfolios” (C. Mason, personal communication, September 21, 2007).  It is crucial to use a variety of methods because students all have different learning styles, and it would be unfair to design just a certain type of measurement that would work well with only a certain type of learner.  

Again, measurements should accommodate all learners, whether it is allowing for different learning styles, or considering students who may have learning disabilities or have other disabilities such as ADHD.  Therefore, design all assignments and assessments with these students in mind.  School guidance counselor, Joy Groves, advises to not create tests and assignment documents that appear disorganized or cluttered (having too-little white space) and if a test is very long, to divide it into sections (J. Groves, personal communication, September 22, 2007).  Another thing to do is to make sure every student has plenty of time to complete in-class assignments and exams.  Dr. Mason encourages making accommodations for students with different ability levels, as long as the accommodations are “reasonable and doable” (C. Mason, personal communication, September 21, 2007).

==Make Homework Meaningful==
The value of homework is currently a hot debate in education, and positions on whether or not it should be given vary greatly.  If you, as a teacher, choose to give homework, you need to at least be sure that the homework is meaningful.  It should not be just “busy work” (Rademacher, 2000).  

Not only must a teacher make sure homework is meaningful, but the teacher must make sure students understand why they are doing the assignment.  There must be a purpose, and it must be apparent.  Acceptable purposes include: gathering background information in preparation for a new lesson or unit; practice; checking for understanding (Checkley, 2003) (with remediation to follow if the teacher finds understanding is lacking); or review (NEA, 2006).

Finally, make sure the homework is actually worth the students’ time.  If you give a lengthy homework assignment, such as a week-long project, make sure it involves higher-level thinking (Checkley, 2003) and covers multiple topics or fully a major theme.

==Create Effective Exams==
Regarding effective exams, Mrs. Groves again uses that word, “variety.”  If using the common type questions (multiple-choice, true/false, matching, and fill-in-the-blank type), she reasserts the idea of varying which types of questions appear.  “Teachers could also, over time, develop enough different types of questions that they could create an extra section on their tests, and students could choose what sections they want to answer.”  She explains how this allows students to be tested in the ways in which they are most comfortable, and the test itself therefore cannot “weaken what students have to tell you” (J. Groves, personal communication, September 22, 2007).

More effective than these common types of questions are those that require more critical thinking, typically short-answer responses.  Dr. Mason prefers his staff to create tests that “require use of higher order thinking skills” and that call for identifying and solving problems (C. Mason, personal communication, September 21, 2007).  Though they may be more cumbersome for teachers to grade, the short answer and even essay responses give the greatest opportunity for students to show what they really know, whereas in other question types, such as multiple-choice, they can simply guess.  Mrs. Groves offered, “I do think it would be great to see writing prompts more prevalent on tests in all courses, including science and math, because that is shown as a national weakness, and you see colleges focusing on it.”  She also mentions the new focus on writing by the re-designed SAT (J. Groves, personal communication, September 22, 2007).

==Consider Alternative Assessments==
A new trend in education is alternative assessments.  Dr. Mason says, “I like them for students with learning differences” and Mrs. Groves says, “I definitely think alternative assessments are great ideas, whether it’s writing, group presentations, group projects” (C. Mason, personal communication, September 21, 2007, &amp; J. Groves, personal communication, September 22, 2007). The North Central Regional Educational Laboratory defines alternative assessment as “any type of assessment in which students create a response to a question or task” in contrast to “traditional assessments,” where “students choose a response from a given list, such as multiple-choice, true/false, or matching” (NCREL, 2007).

The best kinds of alternative assessments are those that are closely related to real-world events  (CCCOE, 2003).  For example, in a business class, students may have to go through a mock process of purchasing a car, renting a house, and establishing a household budget.  One specific assignment I’ve used in the past is a writing project designed to replace a more traditional test on the book, To Kill a Mockingbird.  The assignment gives students four separate options, such as a critique option, a “what if?” creative writing option regarding a key character, and an option to compare and contrast a major plot point with how it’s presented in the book versus how it’s presented in the film.  Each prompt requires critical understanding of the text, and students get to choose which options suits them best.  Additionally, just the mere fact of being able choose sets the students at ease, because they often can feel overwhelmed with how much they are told to do and how little they feel they can choose to do.

==Assess Frequently==
You should assess students constantly in order to properly monitor their progress, and also to have the opportunity for interventions before students get too far behind (Many, 2006).  A crucial step in the teaching process is tutoring after an exam (C. Mason, personal communication, September 21, 2007).  Frequent assessment is also a way for you to know if you are teaching effectively.  If assessments clearly show that students are not learning, you may need to alter your means of instruction

==Keep it Simple==
No matter how inventive your assessments may be, make sure to never make them too confusing.  Write clear questions.  Give clear instructions on assignments.  Don’t give them “trick questions.”   Remember the goal is not to “win” in a game, but to give the student a chance (and a comfortable chance) to express what he or she has learned or can do.

For example, the following assignment is a challenge in itself just to understand what the teacher is looking for:

&lt;font color=blue&gt;Write 6 sentences using the verb, “to be” in present tense.  Write 6 sentences using 6 different action verbs in the present tense.  Use 12 different subjects, intermixing nouns and pronouns.&lt;/font&gt;

The purpose of this assignment is to make sure students can correctly form verbs in the present tense, so a more effective way of presenting this would be to create a worksheet something like:

&lt;font color=blue&gt;Complete the following sentences using the verb “to be” in present tense.

I _______________________________________________________.

My uncle _______________________________________________________.

The dogs _______________________________________________________.

They _______________________________________________________.

These books _______________________________________________________.

She _______________________________________________________.


Complete the following sentences using action verbs in present tense.  Don’t use the same verb more than once.

He _______________________________________________________.

The basketball team _______________________________________________________.

Your teacher _______________________________________________________.

You _______________________________________________________.

We _______________________________________________________.

That dog _______________________________________________________.&lt;/font&gt;


Give your students every opportunity to be successful.

==Give Students a Chance to Think==
Life is just one big series of problems that need solutions, and the best way to get young people ready for the real world is to train them in solving problems.  Whenever possible, give students assignments that make them think and figure, or, as Dr. Mason says, “require diagnosis and providing a plan to address a problem” (C. Mason, personal communication, September 21, 2007).  Remember that education should not be all memorizing and regurgitation.  Education is not merely about what students are to take in, but it is also about what students are able to put out.

Examples of this strategy in action:

;History class: Rather than merely summarizing events and plotting them on a timeline, analyze a situation considering problem/solution.  What was the problem?  How was it solved?  How might it have been solved instead?  Strategies of the Confederacy during the Civil War would be interesting to analyze like this.
;Math class: Show a fully-worked algebra problem that is solved incorrectly, and ask the student to identify the place where the mistake was made and to then correctly solve the problem.
;English class: Discuss a character in literature with a significant flaw, such as Torvald in Henrik Ibsen’s play, A Doll’s House.  How did Torvald’s actions lead up to an unsatisfying ending for him (his wife leaves him), and how might he have changed to prevent his dismal outcome?

==Conclusion==
In the American school, assessment is the measure of all education, and this is critical to the point where it can seem like it is all education is.  Assessment must be created carefully, and conscientious to needs of the student, both directly, and indirectly, in the case that it must provide adequate information to you, the teacher, so that you can, in turn, further help the student.  Remember the importance of variety, incorporate higher-level thinking and writing as much as possible, and consider alternatives to common types of assessment while keeping in mind that your goal is not just to teach state standards, but also to prepare young adults for the rest of their lives.

{{question-answer|question=Consider the subject area you teach or plan to teach and also consider what you’ve learned regarding alternative assessment.  Discuss an alternative assessment assignment you might give in your subject area and explain why the assignment would be more effective than a traditional test.
|answer=Alternative assessment is getting to be a trend in American education, and for good reason.  It offers students a better chance of showing what they have actually learned and what they actually can do, rather than what they can memorize.  An excellent place to use alternative assessment would be in a theatre arts class as a final assessment on ''Oedipus Rex''.

To create an alternative assessment for ''Oedipus Rex'', I would design several assignment options, each requiring a critical understanding of the play, yet each appealing to different styles of learning.  A couple of the assignment options I’d present are as follows.

One assignment option would be to choose a critical moment in the play and rewrite a monologue in a way that a modern teenager would speak.  The student must then act out the monologue with the same passion and emotion the character in ''Oedipus Rex'' would be feeling, but with a modern twist to the dialogue.  This assignment would require an understanding of the text itself, and of the subtext involving the emotions of the principal characters.

Another assignment option would be to write a short story based on “what if?”  The “what if?” would be asking what if a major plot point had happened differently.  This assignment would require creativity and a solid understanding of the cause and effect within the play, and also an understanding of the characters and their motivations, because the student would have to know them well enough to write fresh text true to what has already been established.

This assessment would be effective because it would give students a chance to choose an assignment they are most comfortable with and therefore a greater feeling of confidence in their work.  It is also better than a more typical assessment that would involve recalling facts, because it focuses on the actual learning, rather than memorization.  It focuses on theme and characters and understanding subtext.}}

|One of the most fundamental objects in R is the ''vector'', used to store multiple measurements of the same type (e.g. data variables). There are several different sorts of data that can be stored in a vector. Most common is the '''numeric vector''', in which each element of the vector is simply a number. Other commonly used types of vector are '''character vectors''' (where each element is a piece of text) and '''logical vectors''' (where each element is either &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These are special words in R, and cannot be used as names for objects. The objects &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt; are temporary shortcuts for &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;, but if you use them, watch out: since T and F are just normal object names you can change their meaning by overwriting them.&lt;/ref&gt;). In this topic we will use some example vectors provided by the &quot;datasets&quot; package, containing data on States of the USA (see &lt;code&gt;?state&lt;/code&gt;).

R is an inherently vector-based program; in fact the numbers we have been using in previous calculations are just treated as vectors with a single element. This means that most basic functions in R will behave sensibly when given a vector as a argument, as shown below.
|state.area                #a NUMERIC vector giving the area of US states, in square miles
state.name                #a CHARACTER vector (note the quote marks) of state names 
sq.km &lt;- state.area*2.59  #Arithmetic works on numeric vectors, e.g. convert sq miles to sq km
sq.km                     #... the new vector has the calculation applied to each element in turn
sqrt(sq.km)               #Many mathematical functions also apply to each element in turn 
range(state.area)         #But some functions return different length vectors (here, just the max &amp; min).
length(state.area)        #and some, like this useful one, just return a single value.

|Note that the first part of your output may look slightly different to that above. Depending on the width of your screen, the number of elements printed on each line of output may differ. This is the reason for the numbers in square brackets, which are produced when vectors are printed to the screen. These bracketed numbers give the position of the first element on that line, which is a useful visual aid. For instance, looking at the printout of state.name, and counting across from the second line, we can tell that the eighth state is Delaware.}}

|You may occasionally need to create your own vectors from scratch (although most vectors are obtained from processing data in already-existing files). The most commonly used function for constructing vectors is &lt;code&gt;c()&lt;/code&gt;, so named because it &lt;u&gt;c&lt;/u&gt;oncatenates objects together. However, if you wish to create vectors consisting of regular sequences of numbers (e.g. 2,4,6,8,10,12, or 1,1,2,2,1,1,2,2) there are several alternative functions you can use, including &lt;code&gt;seq()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rep()&lt;/code&gt;, and the &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; operator.

{{Code:Interactive
|code=RCode
|From the help page, we have seen that the sample function can take a number of different arguments. ''x'' must be a vector of items, ''size'' must be a number. Since 1:6 gives a vector of the numbers from 1 to 6, we can set x&amp;#61;1:6 and size&amp;#61;5. Here are 5 examples (note that the first 4 are equivalent, although the actual result will differ due to chance effects when sampling&lt;ref&gt;call set.seed(1) before each chapter to get exactly the same results&lt;/ref&gt;). 
|&lt;pre&gt;###The next 4 lines are equivalent, 5 numbers are selected from a list of 1..6
sample(x=1:6, size=5, replace=FALSE) #when sampling WITHOUT replacement, each number only appears once
sample(replace=FALSE, size=5, x=1:6) #you can change the order of the arguments
sample(x=1:6, size=5)                #the same, because replace=FALSE by default
sample(1:6, 5)        #we don't need x= and size= if arguments are in the same order as in the help file
### The next line is a different model
sample(1:6, 5, TRUE)                 #sampling WITH replacement (the same number can appear twice)
###The next 4 lines are equivalent, 5 numbers are selected from a list of 1..6
sample(x=1:6, size=5, replace=FALSE) #when sampling WITHOUT replacement, each number only appears once
[1] 1 5 4 3 6
sample(replace=FALSE, size=5, x=1:6) #you can change the order of the arguments
[1] 5 6 4 2 1
sample(x=1:6, size=5)                #the same, because replace=FALSE by default
[1] 2 3 4 6 5
sample(1:6, 5)        #we don't need x= and size= if arguments are in the same order as in the help file
[1] 1 6 3 5 4
### Now simulate a different model
sample(1:6, 5, TRUE)                 #sampling WITH replacement (the same number can appear twice)
[1] 3 6 2 1 3&lt;/pre&gt;
|As noted, our &quot;fair die&quot; model is one of sampling with replacement: the same number can appear twice (and indeed does in our data). So our simulation model in R is simply &lt;pre&gt;sample(1:6, 5, TRUE) &lt;/pre&gt;}}

|There are a number of ways to get help in R, and there is also a wide variety of online information. Most installations of R come with a reasonably detailed help file called &quot;An Introduction to R&quot;, but this can be rather technical for first-time users of a statistics package. Almost all functions and other objects that are automatically provided in R have a help page which gives intricate details about how to use them. These help pages usually also contain examples, which can be particularly helpful for new users. However, if you don't know the name of what you are looking for, then finding help may not be so easy, although it is possible to search for keywords and concepts that are associated with objects.
Some versions of R give easy access to help files without having to type in commands (for example, versions which provide menu bars usually have a &quot;help&quot; menu, and the Macintosh interface also has a help box in the top right hand corner). However, this functionality can always be accessed by typing in the appropriate commands. You might like to type some or all of the following into an R session (no output is listed here because the result will depend on your R system).
|help.start()            #A web-based set of help pages (try the link to &quot;An Introduction to R&quot;)
help(sqrt)              #Show details of the &quot;sqrt&quot; and similar functions
?sqrt                   #A shortcut to do the same thing
example(sqrt)           #run the examples on the bottom of the help page for &quot;sqrt&quot;
help.search(&quot;maximum&quot;)  #gives a list of functions involving the word &quot;maximum&quot;, but oddly, &quot;max&quot; is not in there!
### The next line is commented out to reduce internet load. To try it, remove the first # sign.
#RSiteSearch(&quot;maximum&quot;)  #search the R web site for anything to do with &quot;maximum&quot;. Probably overkill here! 
|The last but one command illustrates a problem you may come across with using the R help functions. The searching facility for help files is sometimes a bit hit-and-miss. If you can't find exactly what you are looking for, it is often useful to look at the &quot;See also&quot; section of any help files that sound vaguely similar or relevant. In this case, you might probably eventually find the &lt;code&gt;max()&lt;/code&gt; function by looking at the &quot;See also&quot; section of the help file for &lt;code&gt;which.max()&lt;/code&gt;. Not ideal!.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This textbook is intended to teach fundamental [[w:project management|project management]] skills for the '''Project+ certification''' offered by CompTIA, the [[w:Computing Technology Industry Association|Computing Technology Industry Association]], a non-profit, vendor-neutral trade association. Project+ shows that one has the knowledge needed to manage projects. It provides validation of fundamental project management skills. The certification covers the life cycle of a project from initiation and planning through execution, acceptance, support and closure.

There are no prerequisites, and candidates are not required to submit an application or complete additional hours of continuing education.

Project+ divides project management into the following distinct phases:
*[[/Initiating/]]
*[[/Planning/]]
*[[/Executing/]]
*[[/Controlling and Monitoring/]]
*[[/Closing/]]

These are templates used in my user namespace, but won't likely be useful anywhere else. Some templates that create direct edit links to pages in my user space, or templates which contain my signature, have been protected against transclusion into other pages besides my user space. Other templates may be used in other places, if needed. I will revert any changes made to these templates: if changes need to be made to suit them for a particular application, please copy the code to a new location and edit it there.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What are the Benefits of Nasal Irrigation?

===Simple Nose Washing===
It is simple learning to wash your nose and nasal passages using only a bathroom sink. If the procedure is unpleasant, you're doing it wrong. First, learn to blow your nose into the sink instead of a tissue or handkerchief. Second, learn to push water into your nostrils/nasal passages by brushing wet hands along the sides of your nose. Use warm water. Afterwards, you may wait 10 seconds at first, blow your nose into the sink. Lastly, you can learn to get water further into your nasal passages by wetting your nose and tilting back your head. 
[[Image:Neti_pot.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A Himalayan Institute neti pot.]]

===Saline Nasal Wash===
This remedy is used to treat any symptoms of mucus build-up in the nasal passages, caused by the common cold or chronic sinusitis. It consists of warm water (not too hot or it will burn your nose!) mixed with regular table salt. It can be applied through the nose using either a little spray bottle, or using a neti pot. A neti pot (often made of porcelain) resembles a tea pot that is used for nasal irrigation. It is used often in [[Ethnomedicine/Ethnomedicine_by_Culture_Group#Indian_Culture|South Asian Culture]] and is known as '''Jala Neti''', but is starting to be used more and more in Western Culture. To use this, one mixes the salt and water in the pot and sticks the spout through one nostril, head tilted slightly forward so the water may enter the nose, and the salt water is poured through one nostril and out the other nostril. Repeat on the other side, and make sure to gently blow your nose after using to get rid of excess water and mucus in the nasal passages. This method may be used as often as needed, up to about four times a day when you are sick. Some risks associated with using this remedy are not adequately draining all of the water out, which may lead to breathing problems later, or irritation of the lining of the nasal cavity.

See also: Wikipedia article on [[Wikipedia:nasal irrigation|nasal irrigation]].

==Steps==

=== Prepare isotonic saline solution ===

Please Note:  The Mayo Clinic web site, in the directions for nasal irrigation, specifies using 1/4 tsp. salt to 2 cups (about 1/2 litre) of water - an isotonic solution.  This is significantly less salt than is contained in the directions below.  One of the mixtures is not an isotonic solution.

Prepare isotonic saline solution. This solution matches the concentration of salt found in the blood and natural tears. A warm saline solution is prepared to a 0.9% salinity (9g of salt (about 1 1/2 teaspoons) per litre of water).  Non-iodized salt is better. The water should feel slightly warm to the touch. It is important to stir the mixture thoroughly in order to dissolve all the salt.  The following are the stages of the ancient Jala Neti:

The salt is sometimes replaced with half salt and half sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). According to [http://www.doctorhoffman.com/ydouche.htm http://www.doctorhoffman.com/], sodium bicarbonate improves the mucus-solvent properties of the solution.

Many people only practice stage one of Jala neti. This stage should always be performed whether it is the only stage you do or if you plan to do any of the more advanced stages. Each stage should eventually use about 1/4 litre (8 US fluid ounces) per nostril though a person may have to work up to this.

* Lean over a sink and tilt your head to the side and slightly down toward the sink.  Ideally, the chin and the forehead should be level with each other.
* Place the spout of the neti pot in the upper nostril creating a complete seal and allow the saline solution to flow into that nostril, through the nasal passages, and out the other nostril.
* Continue to breathe deeply through the mouth.  This allows the water to flow from one nostril and out the other.
* When the pot is empty, refill it and repeat on the other side. Beginners may prefer to use only half a pot on each side.
* If the water seems to be blocking, switching back and forth several times may be needed.
* If you will be doing only Stage One, follow the instructions under &quot;After Stages are completed&quot; to clear the nasal passages of remaining water.

If you are doing this for the first time, try to keep your soft palate closed. To find what this feels like, imitate how a congested person with a cold talks. They might say, &quot;I cad't say adythig dorbally because by dose is codgested&quot; instead of &quot;I can't say anything normally because my nose is congested.&quot; Intentionally breathing only through your mouth, and not through your nose, also causes you to keep the soft palate closed. If you can keep the soft palate closed during stage one, this will prevent the irrigation solution from getting into your nose or throat.

=== Stage two ===
Since stage two washes the deepest parts of the nasal passage, it should only be performed after a round of stage one.  If infections or large obstructions are present in the outer nasal cavity and not cleared by stage one, they could be driven deeper into the nasal cavity.

Beginners should use only stage one for the first few weeks to make sure they are comfortable with the process and to make sure that major blockages are clear.

Stage two involves lightly sniffing the water through each nostril and spitting it out the mouth.  It is important not to swallow the water.

Though this stage is more difficult, it has a much deeper effect.  People with chronic sinus infections may not see major improvement until this method is used.

=== Stage three ===
Before this stage, a round of both stage one and two is performed.  It involves actually taking the water in the mouth and directing it out the nose.

=== After stages are completed ===
Once jala neti has been performed, it is important to eliminate any remaining water from the nose.  The techniques may vary but it usually involves bending over from the waist to let the remaining saline solution drain out, breathing quick breaths out the nose in quick repetition, and gently blowing the nose.  It is important not to close off one nostril or squeeze the nose in any way as this may cause water to be forced into areas that do not dry easily. A tissue may be used but is just held lightly surrounding the nose.

== Pulsating nasal irrigation ==
Several medical reports indicate pulsatile nasal irrigation with a water pik type device is more effective than non-pulsating nasal wash products like bulb syringes, neti pots and squeeze bottles which rely simply on gravity and conventional flow at breaking down biofilm, general cleansing and removing bacteria.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is  laparoscopic surgery ?==

                                
''Laparoscopic surgery'' is unique and also interesting such in a way that a video cam (''laparoscope'') and some microscopic surgical instruments are used to perform an operation. There are many types of laparoscopic surgery, the most successful of which are laparoscopic surgery of the pancreas, liver, and bile duct. It is also known as ''minimally invasive surgery'' (MIS).

==How is it done?==
  
Let's take this as an example: laparoscopic surgery on the abdomen. To perform this intricate procedure, a surgeon will initially make a few tiny incisions on the part of the body. Tube-like instruments will then be inserted, and some type of gas - which, of course, is not hazardous - will fill the abdomen. This is to allow the surgeon to have a clear view of what is being carried out.

==Why perform laparoscopic surgery?==
This type of surgery is the next best thing to plastic surgery. Normal operations usually require large openings to gain access to the organs. These large opening can leave large scars. Since tiny surgical instruments are used in laparoscopic surgery, smaller openings are required; therefore, it results in smaller scars.

==What is its function?==



==How does it help the body?==
Laproscopic surgery can help the body like any other kind of surgery can, with the added benefit of using a small incision rather than something larger that would require more stitches. Smaller incisions heal faster and run a lower risk of developing infections.

==How can you prevent yourself from undergoing this surgery?==



== The benefits of laparoscopic surgery ==



== The future of laparoscopic surgery ==
It will only be around for about 10 more years due to the rapidly developing nanotechnology field.

{{Code:Interpreted
|lang={{:Statistical_Analysis:_an_Introduction_using_R/R/Syntax}}
|R is what is known as an &quot;object-oriented&quot; program. Everything (including the numbers you have just typed) is a type of object. Later we will see why this concept is so useful. For the time being, you need only note that you can give a name to an object, which has the effect of storing it for later use. Names can be assigned by using the arrow-like signs &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as demonstrated in the exercise below. Which sign you use depends on whether you prefer putting the name first or last (it may be helpful to think of &lt;code&gt;-&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as &quot;put into&quot; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt; as &quot;set to&quot;).

Unlike many statistical packages, R does not usually display the results of analyses you perform. Instead, analyses usually end up by producing an object which can be stored. Results can then be obtained from the object at leisure. For this reason, when doing statistics in R, you will often find yourself naming and storing objects. The name you choose should consist of letters, numbers, and the &quot;.&quot; character&lt;ref&gt;If you are familiar with computer programming languages, you may be used to using the underscore (&quot;_&quot;) character in names. In R, &quot;.&quot; is usually used in its place.&lt;/ref&gt;, and should not start with a number.

|0.001 -&gt; small.num                #Store the number 0.0001 under the name &quot;small.num&quot; (i.e. put 0.0001 into small.num)
big.num &lt;- 10 * 100               #You can put the name first if you reverse the arrow (set big.num to 10000).
big.num+small.num+1               #Now you can treat big.num and small.num as numbers, and use them in calculations
my.result &lt;- big.num+small.num+2  #And you can store the result of any calculation
my.result                         #To look at the stored object, just type its name
pi                                #There are some named objects that R provides for you
|&gt; 0.001 -&gt; small.num                #Store the number 0.0001 under the name &quot;small.num&quot; (i.e. put 0.0001 into small.num)
&gt; big.num &lt;- 10 * 100               #You can put the name first if you reverse the arrow (set big.num to 10000).
&gt; big.num+small.num+1               #Now you can treat big.num and small.num as numbers, and use them in calculations

&gt; my.result &lt;- big.num+small.num+2  #And you can store the result of any calculation

|Note that when the end result of a command is to store (assign) an object, as on input lines 1, 2, and 4, R doesn't print anything to the screen.

It will talk about that which is commonly called Fermat’s last theorem, the subject will be confronted from a principally historic point of view, the concepts and the theorems behind the proof being too complex even for the greater part of professional mathematicians. The book will follow a time based logic starting from the beginnings of mathematics up to arrival in our times, as a matter of fact having nevertheless been enunciated in 1637, the theorem has profound implications for many branches of mathematics and the premises that give birth to it begin right in the primordial days of mathematics.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:130%&quot;&gt; '''''(Reinventing the Op-amp Inverting Voltage-to-Current Converter)'''''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:100%; color:#FF0000&quot;&gt;'''Circuit idea:''' ''The op-amp compensates the external losses caused by the load adding as much voltage to the input voltage source as it loses across the load.''&lt;/span&gt;

   
[[Image:Active_v-to-i_how_to_convert_450.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1. How do we transform the imperfect passive voltage-to-current converter into a perfect op-amp one?&lt;/center&gt;]]

== Speculation: ''The active version is just an improved passive one'' ==

In this story, we begin revealing the secret of ''active voltage-to-current converters'' alias ''voltage-controlled current sources'' (VCCSs) or ''transconductance amplifiers''. Let us start with the simplest and most intuitive ''op-amp inverting voltage-to-current converter''.

Look first at the [[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter|&quot;bad&quot; passive version]] (the top of Fig. 1) and then, at the &quot;good&quot; active version (the bottom of Fig. 1) of a voltage-to-current converter. It is not absolutely necessary to be clever:), in order to see that the active version contains the passive one + an op-amp connected in accordance with some powerful idea:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:130%; color:#999999&quot;&gt;'''''Active V-to-I converter = passive V-to-I converter + op-amp + great idea ?''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

It seems that there is a close interrelation between the two circuits: maybe, the active version comes from the passive one or maybe the active version is just an improved passive version? If it is, how has the passive circuit transmuted into an active one? What is the idea of this connection?  What does the op-amp do in this circuit? Let's try to answer these questions by following the evolution of the [[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter|passive circuit]] into an active one.

== Problem: ''The real load affects the current'' ==

[[Image:Passive_v-to-i_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2. The real load affects the current in the passive voltage-to-current converter (go to Stage 2 in the interactive [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/pnfb-builder.html builder] to explore the circuit).&lt;/center&gt;]]

We already knew why the [[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter|simple voltage to-current converter]] (as well as all the passive circuits) is an imperfect circuit - because ''its output current depends on the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; across the load'' (Fig. 2). In this arrangement, the effective voltage difference V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; determines the current I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; instead of only the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;; .As a result, the current decreases. You can explore the circuit operation in a more attractive way, if you click ''Exploring'' button in the interactive flash [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/circuit-collection/circuits/old-circuits/v-to-i-old.html movie] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/circuit-collection/circuits/old-circuits/v-to-i-old.html Passive voltage-to-current converter] is an animated ''Flash'' tutorial revealing the philosophy of the passive version.&lt;/ref&gt; or if you go to ''Stage 2'' in the interactive flash [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/pnfb-builder.html builder].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/pnfb-builder.html Op-amp circuit builder] ([http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my_work/conferences/et_2003/builder/builder.pdf movie philosophy]) is an interactive ''Flash'' tutorial that shows how to transform any passive converter into an active one. Choose the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the library on the right side to build an active voltage-to-current converter.&lt;/ref&gt;

We can look at the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; from two contrary viewpoints. From the point of view of the input voltage source, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is harmful; so, the input source &quot;would like&quot; this voltage not to exist. Contrarily, from the point of view of the load, V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is useful voltage drop as it usually serves as an output quantity; so, the load &quot;would like&quot; this voltage to exist and even it to be as much as possible high.

Obviously, there is a contradiction here - the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; has to exist and, at the same time, not to exist. How do we solve this contradiction?

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Basic non-electrical idea: ''Removing a disturbance by an &quot;antidisturbance&quot;'' ==

Remember what we do in real life when we solve some problem but a disturbance '''caused by others''' stands in our way. The classical remedy is to ''remove the cause of the disturbance''. Only, it is not always possible to do that; then, we use another exotic solution - we ''remove the disturbance by an equivalent &quot;antidisturbance&quot;''. For this purpose, we use an additional power source (energy), which &quot;helps&quot; us (the main source) by compensating only the local losses caused by the undesired '''external''' quantity. This technique is associated with continuous wasting of additional energy but the result is zero ([http://circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/virtual_ground/virtual_ground.htm virtual ground] &lt;ref&gt;[http://circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/virtual_ground/virtual_ground.htm How do we create a virtual ground?] reveals the secret of the great circuit phenomenon on which the op-amp inverting voltage-to-current converter is based.&lt;/ref&gt;); so, we prefer to use it when we are rich and, at the same time, lazy enough:). Here are some funny examples.

If someone has broken our window in winter, we may turn on a heater (instead of just repairing the broken window); in summer, we turn on an air-conditioner. If the windows become dirty, we may switch on additional lamps inside the room to &quot;help&quot; the sun (instead of just cleaning the windows). When a car has come into collision with our car, the insurance company compensates the damages caused by the else's car (instead of just preventing the crash). If someone (e.g., our wife or a husband) is spending money from our account, we might begin depositing money into the account to restore the sum (instead of just scolding her/him:) When we go to a mountain, we stock with food, water, medicine, etc. to use them, if there is a future need (instead of just not going to the mountain:). In all these cases,

''we have prepared (just in case) &quot;standby&quot; resources to use them, if there is a need to compensate eventual external losses''.

== Basic electrical idea: ''Removing voltage by an &quot;antivoltage&quot;'' ==

=== Building the electric circuit ===

[[Image:Active_v-to-i_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3. Active V-to-I converter = passive V-to-I converter + &quot;helping&quot; voltage source (go to Stage 3 in the interactive [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/pnfb-builder.html builder] to explore the circuit).&lt;/center&gt;]]

Now, let us put this powerful idea into practice. The voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; across the resistor R is harmful; so, following the recipe above, we have to remove it by an &quot;antivoltage&quot; -V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. In other words, we have to add so much voltage to the input (excitation) voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;, as much as it loses across the load L

&lt;center&gt;''Active V-to-I converter = passive V-to-I converter + &quot;helping&quot; voltage source''&lt;/center&gt;

The best way to understand what real electronic components do is just to do their work. So, let us first build a &quot;man-controlled&quot; active circuit, in which a man (I might do this donkeywork:) produces the &quot;anti-voltage&quot; while you change the input voltage. For this purpose, I first place an additional supplementary battery B&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; in series to the load L (Fig. 3). Then, in order to compare the two voltages, I connect a zero indicator in point A, which shows the result of comparison V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. See how simple it is:

''Add an adjustable battery in series with the load and make its voltage equal to the voltage drop across the load!''

=== Exploring the electric circuit ===

In the beginning, imagine that there is not input excitation voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; (see again Fig. 3 above). As a result, there are not any voltage drops and currents in the circuit; the needle of the zero indicator points to zero position. I am happy because there is nothing to do:)

If you increase the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;, a current begins flowing through the load. As a result, a voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; appears across the load and the point A begins rising its potential V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (figuratively speaking, the input source &quot;pulls&quot; the point A up toward the positive voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;). Only, I observe to my great displeasure:( that the needle deflects to the right and immediately react by decreasing the compensating voltage V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;. Now, it &quot;pulls&quot; the point A down toward the negative voltage -V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; until it manages to zero the potential V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (the [[Wikipedia:Virtual ground|virtual ground]]). Note that the two voltage sources are connected in series, in one and the same direction (- V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; +, - V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; +) so that their voltages are added (let us assume that we traverse the loops clockwise). Regarding to the ground, they have opposite polarities.

In this way, the input voltage source is &quot;helped&quot;; its voltage increases so much (V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) as it loses across the load. As a result, the &quot;harmful&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; disappears; the point A has zero voltage; it behaves as a [[Wikipedia:Virtual ground|virtual ground]]. The passive voltage-to-current converter is &quot;fooled&quot;: it has the illusion that there is not a load connected; it &quot;thinks&quot; that its output is shorted.

You can imagine what happens when you decrease the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; under the ground. As above, I will adjust the battery voltage looking at the needle of the zero indicator, so that always V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = -V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. In electronics, in technics and in our world, this action is referred to as [[Wikipedia:Negative feedback|negative feedback]] (it is a great phenomenon).

== Op-amp inverting voltage-to-current converter ==

=== Building the electronic circuit ===

Let us now try to make some electronic device do this donkeywork; an op-amp seems to be a good choice. For this purpose, we connect the op-amp's output in the place of the helping voltage source and the op-amp's input to point A so that the op-amp to &quot;help&quot; the input source (the op-amp's output voltage and the input voltage to be summed).

&lt;center&gt;''Op-amp V-to-I converter = passive V-to-I converter + &quot;helping&quot; op-amp''&lt;/center&gt;

=== Exploring the electronic circuit ===

In the beginning, imagine as [[#Exploring the electric circuit|above]] that there is not an input excitation voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, there are not any voltage drops and currents in the circuit. There is almost not a voltage difference between the inverting and non-inverting input of the op-amp; now, it is &quot;happy&quot; because there is nothing to do:)

[[Image:Op-amp_inv_v-to-i_pos_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4. Op-amp V-to-I converter = passive V-to-I converter + &quot;helping&quot; op-amp (driven by a positive input voltage). Go to Stage 4 in the interactive [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/tools/pnfb-builder.html builder].&lt;/center&gt;]]

==== Positive input voltage ====

If the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; increases, an output current I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; begins flowing through the load L. As a result, a voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; appears across the load L and the point A begins rising its potential V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (the input source &quot;pulls&quot; the point A up toward the positive voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;). Only, the op-amp &quot;observes&quot; that to his great displeasure:( and immediately reacts: it decreases its output voltage &quot;sucking&quot; the current I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; until it manages to zero the potential V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. Figuratively speaking, the op-amp &quot;pulls&quot; the point A down toward the negative voltage -V to establish a virtual ground. It does this magic by connecting a part of the voltage produced by the negative power supply -V in series with the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. As [[#Exploring the electric circuit|above]], the two voltage sources are connected in series, in one and the same direction (- V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; +, - V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; +) so that their voltages are added. Only, regarding to the ground, they have opposite polarities.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Op-amp_inv_v-to-i_neg_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5. Op-amp V-to-I converter = passive V-to-I converter + &quot;helping&quot; op-amp (driven by a negative input voltage).&lt;/center&gt;]]

==== Negative input voltage ====

If the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; decreases under the ground, an input current I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; begins flowing through the load L in opposite direction. As a result, a voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; appears across the load L and the point A begins dropping its potential V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (now, the input source &quot;pulls&quot; the point A down toward the negative voltage -V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;). Only, the op-amp &quot;observes&quot;' that and immediately reacts: it increases its output voltage &quot;pushing out&quot; the current I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; until it manages to zero the potential V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (now, the op-amp &quot;pulls&quot; the point A up toward the positive voltage +V, in order to establish a virtual ground). It does this magic by connecting a part of the voltage produced by the positive power supply +V in series with the input voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. The two voltage sources are connected in series again, in one and the same direction (+ V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; -, + V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; -) so that their voltages are added. Regarding to the ground, they have opposite polarities as above.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

'''Conclusion.''' ''In the circuit of an op-amp voltage-to-current converter, the op-amp adds as much voltage to the voltage of the input source as it loses across the external load. The op-amp compensates the local losses caused by this '''external load''' (conversely, in the opposite [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter|op-amp inverting current-to-voltage converter]], the op-amp compensates the losses caused by the '''internal resistor''').''

== Applications of the op-amp V-to-I converter ==

Once we created a perfect voltage-to-current converter, we may use it as a building block to build more complex compound circuits. For this purpose, we have only to connect consecutively the separate building blocks.

[[Image:Op-amp_inv_current_source_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6. Op-amp inverting current source = voltage source + op-amp V-to-I converter&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Staying after the circuit output ===

First, we may connect the op-amp voltage-to-current converter after circuits having voltage output; thus we make them produce current. For example, we have known how to build a simple current source

''Simple current source = voltage source + passive V-to-I converter''

Now, we can build a perfect op-amp constant current source (Fig. 6)

''Op-amp current source = Voltage source + op-amp V-to-I converter''

Its output current does not depend on the load resistance (more generally, on the voltage drop across the load). 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Op-amp_inv_integrator_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7. Op-amp inverting integrator = op-amp V-to-I converter + I-to-V C integrator&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Staying before the circuit input ===

Then, we may connect the op-amp voltage-to-current converter before circuits having current input; thus we make them perceive voltage. By applying this technique, we may assemble the famous active circuits of capacitive integrator (Fig. 7), inductive differentiator, diode logarithmic converter, etc.

''Op-amp RC integrator = op-amp V-to-I converter + I-to-V C integrator''

''Op-amp RL differentiator = op-amp V-to-I converter + I-to-V L differentiator''

''Op-amp RD log converter = op-amp V-to-I converter + I-to-V D log converter''

In all these circuits, the voltage drop across the respective I-to-V converters does not introduce an error (precisely speaking, it introduces an error but the op-amp removes it). 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Acting as a transconductance amplifier ===

[[Image:V-to-i inv ampl 1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 8. Op-amp inverting amplifier = op-amp V-to-I converter + I-to-V converter&lt;/center&gt;]]

The op-amp V-to-I converter is an active circuit; so, we may expect it to amplify. Really, it acts as a linear circuit with transfer ratio k = I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; [mA/V] or [[Wikipedia:Siemens|millisiemens]] having dimension of conductivity. That is why, they frequently name it [[Wikipedia:Transconductance amplifier|transconductance amplifier]] (transconductance is a contraction of &quot;transfer conductance&quot;). Nevertheless, let us try to answer the question, &quot;Is the op-amp V-to-I converter an amplifier?&quot;

To answer this question, let's assemble the famous op-amp inverting amplifier by connecting  consecutively an op-amp voltage-to-current converter (R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and OA) and a bare resistor R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acting as a simple current-to-voltage converter (Fig. 8)

''Op-amp inverting amplifier = op-amp V-to-I converter + I-to-V converter''

Note that the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; serves here as the load L from Fig. 5). This circuit will amplify power, if the output power is greater than the input one. So, the output voltage has to be higher than the input one because the current is the same.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Comparison between the passive and active version ==

[[Image:Active_v-to-i_in_res_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 9. The input resistance is only R.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Let us finally compare the two versions beginning by investigating the input and output resistances (for concreteness, let us assume a bare resistive load R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;). 

'''Input resistance.''' First, connect an ammeter ''in series with'' and a voltmeter ''in parallel to'' the converter's input; then vary the input voltage to investigate the input resistance. Maybe you remember that in the passive version, looking from the side of the input source we were seeing two resistors connected in series; so, the input resistance was R&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = R + R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. Now, we see only the resistor R because the op-amp has &quot;neutralized&quot; the load resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.

It is wonderful, the load has disappeared! As a result, the input resistance is R&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = R and what is more interesting, it does not depend on the load resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;! In this case, the op-amp &quot;helps&quot; the input voltage in its striving to change the current.

[[Image:Active_v-to-i_out_res_1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 10. The output resistance tends to infinite.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Output resistance.'''  Now, connect a voltmeter ''in parallel to'' and an ammeter ''in series with'' the converter's output; then, vary the load resistance (voltage) and observe the current to investigate the output resistance. Remember that in the passive version, looking from the side of the load, we were seeing only the resistor R; so, the output resistance was R&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = R. Now, the situation is quite more interesting: when we vary the load voltage the current stays steady! But why?

In this case, the op-amp &quot;opposes&quot; the load in its striving to change the current. As a result, the voltage varies (even significantly) while the current stays unchanged; so, the output differential resistance tends to infinite.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

'''Operating range.''' The op-amp does all these &quot;magics&quot; until it can change its output voltage (i.e., until it is within the active region). When it reaches the supply rail, the op-amp saturates, the magic ceases and the almost ideal active circuit becomes again an imperfect passive one:(. They name the maximum voltage drop across the load [http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;aq=t&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGIH,GGIH:2006-52,GGIH:en&amp;q=%22compliance+voltage+%22 compliance voltage]. Note that the passive version does not have such a problem; it is always imperfect.

'''Ground connection.''' In the passive version, the load is connected to the (real) ground while, in the active one, the load is &quot;flying&quot;. More precisely speaking, it is connected to a ground but this is a ''virtual ground''. In some cases it is sufficient but not in others.

== Comparison with other techniques ==

The inverting configuration is not the only possible active voltage-to-current converter. There are other techniques, which excel, in some respect, the idea considered. Let's now consider briefly these techniques; then, we will dedicate special circuit stories to them.

'''Negative feedback.''' Exactly speaking, there is a negative feedback in the inverting configuration discussed here. Only, the negative feedback does not serve to keep up the output current; it serves only to keep up the compensating &quot;antivoltage&quot;. In this arrangement, the op-amp is not actually interested in the current magnitude; it is interested only in the virtual ground magnitude. In the popular implementation - the ''non-inverting configuration'', the op-amp (not the input voltage source) creates the output current, which passes through a constant resistor. Then, the op-amp keeps up the &quot;copy&quot; voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; across the resistor R equal to the &quot;original&quot; input voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. Simply speaking, the op-amp increases its output voltage by the value of the voltage across the load thus compensating it. As a result, the output current depends only on the V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and R; it does not depend on all sorts disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/current_source/current_source_philosophy/current_source_philosophy.htm#step8 Keeping a constant current by negative feedback] shows how to produce a constant curent by applying a negative feedback.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://apex.cirrus.com/en/pubs/appNote/Apex_AN13U_D.pdf Voltage to current conversion - App Note 13] - considers a variety of voltage-controlled current sources.&lt;/ref&gt; By adding an external transistor or by using the internal op-amp output transistors&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edn.com/index.asp?layout=article&amp;articleid=CA6309110&amp;spacedesc=DesignIdeas&amp;taxid=10536&amp;industryid=44217 Op amp can source or sink current] exploits a powerful idea - to use the op-amp supply leads as input/output terminals.&lt;/ref&gt; these circuits can drive grounded loads. Only, the negative feedback configurations have two big errors: the first is caused by the finite op-amp gain; the second - by the common-mode gain.

'''Bootstrapping.''' The famous Baron Munchhausen's idea can help us to achieve the same (and even better) result without using negative feedback. The according circuit implementation is referred to as ''improved Howland current source''; no one knows why ''Motorola'' named it ''current source with feedback''&lt;ref name=&quot;Motorola&quot; /&gt; in 1973?!? The idea is as simple as above: the op-amp increases its output voltage by the value of the voltage drop across the load thus compensating it (compare with the inverting configuration where the op-amp produces an output voltage equal to the voltage drop across the load and adds it to the input voltage). Only, it does this magic &quot;blindly&quot; without using a negative feedback.

'''Negative resistance.'''  The famous circuit of ''Howland current source'' exploits this idea &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philbrickarchive.org/1964-1_v12_no1_the_lightning_empiricist.htm Impedance &amp; admittance transformations using op-amps] - mentions, maybe for the first time, the Howland circuit (great material!)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/understanding_circuits/current_source/howland_current_source/howland_current_source.htm Howland current source for grounded load] reveals the basic idea behind the famous circuit.&lt;/ref&gt;; ''Motorola'' named it a ''differential input op-amp current source''&lt;ref name=&quot;Motorola&quot;&gt;[http://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/AN587-D.PDF Analysis and design of the op-amp current source] is an extremely formal and dull presentation of the Howland current source (it is renamed there as a ''differential input op-amp current source'').&lt;/ref&gt; in 1973. From one viewpoint, it consists of a negative resistor -R connected in parallel to the positive resistor R acting as a [[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter|passive voltage-to-current converter]]. The result of this connection is that the negative resistor &quot;neutralizes&quot; (absorbs) the positive one and the effective differential resistance (the internal source's resistance) is infinite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/ArticleID/1633/1633.html Consider the &quot;Deboo&quot; integrator for unipolar noninverting designs] (see the comments after the article).&lt;/ref&gt; The voltage-to-current converter behaves as a perfect current source, which drives a grounded load. Only, these circuits are not as stable as these exploiting a negative feedback.

The op-amp inverting voltage-to-current converter is not so much popular circuit as the related [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Non-inverting Voltage-to-Current Converter|op-amp non-inverting voltage-to-current converter]] and the opposite [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter|op-amp inverting current-to-voltage converter]]. Actually, it exists in almost every electronics book on op-amp circuits but they do not discern it. As a result, there are few sources where it is presented rather implicitly than manifestly. Here are some of them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The origins of numbers is sometimes thought to be lost in the meanders of human history. As a matter of fact since ancient times man has studied numbers and their properties. In the beginning the study was dictated by practical necessity (measures geometrical, astronomical, economical, etc.) but subsequently some humans began to interest themselves in the properties of numbers and sought to understand not only how to solve problems but also why certain formulae or methods always gave the correct result. This desire of abstraction, desire of exploring the more intimate nature of numbers and of their properties saw one of its greatest exponents in Pythagoras.&lt;/p&gt;

==Pythagoras==
{{SideBox|float=left|'''Pythagoras''' (575 B.C. - 490 B.C.) - mathematician, philosopher, scientist.}}
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;During his life Pythagoras passed the years of his youth navigating the length and breadth of the Mediterranean in search of knowledge. During his travels he learnt practically all the ideas in the field of mathematics possessed by the Egyptians and by the Babylonians but, while these peoples were interested principally in the practical applications, Pythagoras wanted to understand the why of mathematics and more generally of things. After some trials and tribulations he succeeded in founding a school of philosophy, this school differently to modern centres of instruction resembled more a sect where numbers were venerated like divine entities. He who entered the school had to divest himself of all his worldly goods which went into the common purse. An obligation of absolute secrecy with respect to the uninitiated was in force and many myths and legends arose around the school.&lt;/p&gt;

==The theorem of Pythagoras==
Pythagoras is universally famous for his theorem.

Given '''a''' and '''b''' two sides of a right-angled triangle and '''c''' its hypotenuse one has:

::&lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;In reality this equation was known by many other mathematicians of the era but Pythagoras became the father of it since he was the first to furnish a generic proof of the equation. He produced by means of a combination of logic and elementary geometry a proof for every right angled triangle. He then passed from an empirical proof for a finite number of cases to a proof as we currently understand it, that is a proof that it is always true for fixed preconditions. Proofs are those which differentiate mathematics from all other sciences. In sciences such as physics, chemistry, etc., the theories are based on theoretical considerations and on experimental trials but they are never considered definitive, they can always be overtaken by the evolution of knowledge. Instead in mathematics once a theorem has been proved, its veracity can no longer be open to discussion. The theorem of Pythagoras was true two thousand years ago and it will be true even in two thousand years from now. The link between Pythagoras’ theorem and Fermat’s last theorem is obvious, it is enough to substitute the power 2 with a generic power n in order to obtain Fermat’s theorem. In fact the theorem of Pythagoras is a particular case of Fermat’s theorem. Fermat was in fact studying the properties of the pythagorean triads (the solutions of the theorem of Pythagoras) when he enunciated his theorem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pierre de Fermat==
[[Image:Pierre de Fermat.jpg|thumb|130px|Pierre de Fermat]]
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;'''Pierre de Fermat''' (1601 - 1665) - French Magistrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Although his work as a magistrate was very demanding, Fermat found the time to dedicate himself in a most profitable way to the study of '''Mathematics'''. Even though he was not a professional mathematician by training Fermat made important contributions in the study of functions and of the theory of numbers. Fermat conducted an intimate correspondence with various mathematicians of the era, but his natural reserve together with a notable reluctance in making known his discoveries resulted in his genius being discovered a long time after his death, when his son decided to collect his father’s papers and make them public. The famous enigma was idealised by Fermat while he was studying the ''Arithmetica'' of '''Diophantus of Alexandria''', mathematician 212 A.D. to 298 A.D. Diophantus’ book collected together many elegant proofs of complete solutions to problems that mathematicians had faced over the course of centuries; reading the part concerning the Pythagorean triads, one supposes that Fermat may have had the idea of extending the power of 2 to a generic n. Fermat wrote in note in the book the enunciation of his famous theorem and then added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
[[Image:Fermat last teorem.jpg|600px|centre]]

{{quote|Cuius rei demonstrationem mirabilem sane detexi hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet.}}
:&lt;b&gt;[I have discovered a truly marvellous proof of this, which however the margin is not large enough to contain.]&lt;/b&gt;

==The unresolved theorem==
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Fermat was accustomed to annotating his books: many theorems were found in their margins, generally without proof. The proof of these theorems was in some cases simple while in other cases it required hard work. The last theorem in fact takes its name from the fact of being the last of Fermat’s theorems to be proved, not from the fact of having been the last to be enunciated. To be precise, rather, its name was incorrect: until 1994 when it was proved, rather than a theorem it was strictly speaking a conjecture. The majority of mathematicians however used this name: in fact they held it true though not being able to prove it, given that the majority of the affirmations of Fermat had proved themselves true. It goes without saying that these facts are not sufficient to render a conjecture a theorem, but the majority of mathematicians in this particular case passed over this detail without too many problems.&lt;/p&gt;

[[File:Leonhard_Euler.jpeg|thumb|213px|Leonhard Euler]]
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;he publication of Fermat’s writings had generated opposing opinions among mathematicians. The majority of them recognised the usefulness but the fact that the greater part of the theorems were without proof or with incomplete proofs obviously reduced the immediate usefulness of them even if some mathematicians took the theorems as challenges to face and win. Many were faced and resolved but that which subsequently would be called the last theorem resisted all attempted assaults. Leonhard Euler obtained the first results a century after Fermat. Euler was a Swiss mathematician born in 1707 in Basel and died in 1783 in St. Petersburg. Initially Euler was to have become a theologian but Johann Bernoulli became aware of the extraordinary ability of the young man and convinced his father to let Leonhard become a mathematician. This was an enormous good fortune for mathematics given that Euler’s contributions range over so many areas of mathematics and are so profound as to render Euler one of the greatest mathematicians of the XVIII century if not rightly the greatest. Euler analysing the notes written by Fermat found an outline proof of the case n=4. Fermat had written this proof within another proof. In order to prove that case Fermat made use of a technique called infinite descent, Euler sought to utilise this technique for the other cases in such a way as to find a proof for all values of n. Initially he confronted the case n=3. He succeeded in resolving this case but had to make use of complex numbers, in reality other mathematicians had sought to adapt infinite descent to the case n=3 but it took a creative person such as Euler in order to understand that complex numbers were necessary in order to obtain a valid proof. Euler also sought to resolve n=5 but without results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sophie Germain==

&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;After Euler's progress, for around fifty years there were no improvements notwithstanding the fact that the last theorem had become the most famous problem in the theory of numbers. This situation changed radically thanks to Sophie Germain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Sophie Germain was born in 1776 and died in 1831 and for all her life she had to fight against prejudice. In her society it was unthinkable that a lady of good standing dedicated herself to subjects such as mathematics, but Germain when small had read a book on the history of mathematics and remained fascinated by the death of Archimedes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The legend recounts that when a roman soldier went to call Archimedes in order to conduct him in front of the centurion Archimedes refused to follow him being occupied with a geometric problem, for this reason the soldier ran him through. Germain was so struck by the fact that a man could have lost his life for mathematics that she decided to study it. Initially her decision was much opposed by her father, but with the passing of the years he had to resign himself to the wishes of his daughter deciding to support her. Germain found it very difficult to acquire modern mathematical techniques given that her tutors did not intend to teach them to her and she, being a woman, could not attend the university where courses in advanced mathematics were held. Germain then used the stratagem of passing herself off as a monsieur Le Blanc, a student who had withdrawn from the Ecole Polytecnique. Obviously she was not able to attend lessons but utilising this false identity she succeeded in getting herself the printed notes and the problems for the students attending that she solved and presented always under the same pseudonym. In the beginning the trick worked until the course professor, the great mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange, wanted to know the student who furnished those so ingenious solutions. Lagrange meeting Germain was surprised but pleased by the young woman and decided to help her in her study of the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Germain worked for years on the theory of numbers and also interested herself in Fermat's theorem. She obtained a result that she held to be very important but wanting confirmations on the validity of her discovery she decided to contact the then greatest authority, that is to say Carl Friedrich Gauss. Gauss had not interested himself in Fermat's theorem holding the enunciation in itself without interest, but when he received the letter from Germain he remained so impressed by her result as to dedicate himself to the problem and to confirm to Germain the validity of her method. Germain's idea was based on the use of a particular typology of prime numbers that were subsequently called Sophie Germain's prime numbers. For these prime numbers Germain succeeded in demonstrating that solutions of Fermat's theorem probably did not exist. Probably it meant that these eventual solutions would have had some properties so particular as to render the existence of these numbers difficult. Some of her colleagues analysing the problems defined by these prime numbers succeeded in proving that solutions did not exist for some of them, such as 5 or 7. Subsequently Gauss abandoned the theory of numbers in order to dedicate himself to applied mathematics and Germain without further support in the field of mathematics decided to concentrate on physics, where she made important contributions in the study of elastic vibrations.&lt;/p&gt;

==Andrew Wiles==
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;'''Andrew Wiles''' was born in the UK, the 11th of April 1953. From a young age he demonstrated a strong interest in mathematical enigmas and problems. When he was still a small child he loved to go into public libraries in search of books containing problems and enigmas. At the age of 10 years he found in a library the book ''The Last Problem'' by Eric Temple Bell. In this book the author described what came to be known as Fermat's Last Theorem from the Greeks up to the discoveries at the end of the 1800s. The young Wiles remained fascinated by the problem. An equation so simple to enunciate had eluded some of the most able mathematicians of the world and the boy then began to fantasise hoping to find the elementary proof that had eluded the others. Wiles hypothesised that Fermat did not have a knowledge in the mathematical field superior to his own and he therefore sought a proof with his limited knowledge. Obviously he was not able to find it, he would pursue Fermat’s Last Theorem for a good part of his life. Wiles became a professional mathematician and had to temporarily abandon his quest since finding a proof was thought to be too difficult for a young mathematician and that he didn’t hold that it could produce interesting mathematics in the immediate future. Wiles’ dissertation advisor was John Coates, and he directed Wiles in the study of elliptic curves. That was Wiles’ good fortune, since Wiles' was able to use his knowledge of elliptic curves to the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem.&lt;/p&gt;

==Elliptic curves and modular arithmetic==
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Specifically Wiles analysed some elliptic curves in modular arithmetic. 
While classic arithmetic deals with an infinite number of numbers, in modular arithmetic one utilises only a subset of values. Modular arithmetic was also called clock arithmetic, given that this utilised a modular arithmetic with modulo equal to 24. Everyone knows that if it is 18 hundred and one waits for 8 hours one does not find oneself at 26 hundred but at 2 hundred, given that when the clock arrives at 24 it starts to count again from 0. Modular arithmetic is a complete arithmetic like that classic, only that the numbers utilised are limited. Modular arithmetic furthermore has at its disposal some very interesting properties that render it particularly useful in some fields of mathematics. When a mathematician analyses an elliptic curve with modular arithmetic he extracts a series of solutions that are called L-series. Wiles worked much on elliptic curves and on their L-series accumulating experience that would become useful to him in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

==The Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture==
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Towards the end of the 1950s the Japanese mathematicians Yutaka Taniyama and Goro Shimura formulated a conjecture known as the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. This conjecture stated that every L-series of an elliptic curve could be associated with a specific M-series of a modular form. In substance this conjecture asserted that every modular form could be put in bi-unequivocal correspondence with an elliptic curve or, given in other terms, the modular forms and the elliptic curves were the same mathematical object seen from different points of view. This conjecture from the point of view of a mathematician is very important, in fact, if it were proved true, it would have meant that problems of elliptic curves centuries old would be able to be transferred into their modular forms and tackled with new mathematical tools. Obviously the converse would also be valid.&lt;/p&gt;

==The convention of 1984==
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;In 1984 a event happened that revolutionised the life of Wiles: during a convention in Germany Gerhard Frey demonstrated that whoever proved the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture would also automatically have proved Fermat's last theorem. Frey showed with a series of not too complex steps that in a hypothetical counterexample to Fermat's theorem (that is a valid solution of the equation a&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;+b&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;=c&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;) one would be able to write it as an elliptic curve so particular and atypical as not to be able to be associated to any M-series of a modular form. Therefore proving the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture proved that this degenerate equation did not exist and that therefore Fermat's theorem was true. In reality almost everything tied to Fermat's theorem is not as simple as it seems, so much so that the development of a proof that tied Fermat's Last Theorem in an indissoluble manner to the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture caused the mathematicians of half the world to struggle for more than two years, and in fact Frey's initial proof was incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;

==The secret work==
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;In 1986 Wiles came to know that the link between the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture and Fermat's Last Theorem had been demonstrated. This seemed to Wiles a golden opportunity to use advanced mathematics (seeking to prove the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture) to attain the mathematical ambition of his life (proving Fermat's Last Theorem). Wiles decided to work in absolute secrecy, contrary to the prevailing ethos. While in many disciplines it is common when working on a project to maintain strict secrecy, in order to protect patent rights, in mathematics one follows the opposite approach. Mathematicians talked among themselves constantly, successive comparison is an optimum method for facing problems that seem insoluble and in theoretical mathematics the problem of the industrial secret practically does not exist.  Wiles prepared himself carefully, he abandoned all his non-obligatory duties, took an impressive research that he was about to publish, divided it into a good number of articles in such a way as to be able to furnish a constant flux of works while he was working on the conjecture and sought to assimilate as much as possible on modular forms and elliptic curves. Wiles revealed the secret of his work only to his wife. In the first two years of work Wiles made progress utilising the group theory of Galois, although he was still a long way from the solution. The 8th of March 1988 Wiles was stunned to read in the Washington Post that the Japanese mathematician Yoichi Miyaoka had proved Fermat’s conjecture. In reality Miyaoka had not produced a complete proof but utilising differential geometry, a new branch of geometry he had put forward some optimum bases for the definitive solution. Unfortunately for Miyaoka his proof had a gap that although at the beginning did not appear grave, subsequently proved itself to be catastrophic and rendered it impossible to carry out a proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem using that technique. Finally Wiles, utilising a method called Kolyvagin-Flach, succeeded in associating a particular elliptic curve to its modular form. The problem for Wiles was that the method could not be extended to all elliptic curves. Wiles then classified all the elliptic curves into families and modified the method in such a way as to adapt it to single families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Wiles, in order to utilise the Kolyvagin-Flach method, had to profoundly expand his knowledge of algebraic geometry and not being very expert decided in the end to confide himself to a trusted mathematical expert in the sector. Therefore Wiles contacted Nick Katz, a mathematician in his department. Given that the proof was very complex and voluminous an informal discussion in Katz’s study would not have been sufficient in order to sort out all the doubts, the two decided therefore to disguise their meetings as some post graduate lessons. Wiles would have given the lessons while Katz would have participated among the public. Wiles presented the lessons in a very technical and boring manner in such a way as to eventually discourage students. In fact after a few weeks only Katz remained of the class. Wiles thanks to the help of Katz went over his proof again which effectively seemed correct. Finally Wiles working speedily eliminated the remaining families and finally in May of 1993 Wiles finished the proof laying low even the final recalcitrant family.&lt;/p&gt;

==The Cambridge conference==
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;At the end of June at Cambridge a conference was held on L-functions and their arithmetic. In this context, surrounded by some of the most brilliant mathematicians of the planet Wiles presented his proof in a series of three conferences. The 23rd of June the third and final conference took place and a lengthy applause concluded Wiles’ final conference. Fermat’s Last Theorem had been proved. All the world’s papers spoke of the event and in an afternoon Wiles became the most famous mathematician on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

==An error and its resolution==
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Wiles sent the proof to a journal in such a way that the editor of the journal could subject the proof to verification by a qualified commission. The editor of the journal, given the importance and complexity of the proof, subdivided the sheaf into six parts and entrusted them to as many commissioners. These analysed the manuscript piece by piece and contacted Wiles in order to obtain clarifications on unclear passages and presumed errors. One of the commissioners was Katz, the same mathematician that Wiles had contacted in order to verify the correct application of the Kolyvagin-Flach method. Unfortunately for Wiles, Katz identified an error.

Initially it seemed one of the many errors of little account that stud a complex proof. These errors are comparable to oversights and usually they are corrected in the space of a few hours but that error even if very subtle was also very insidious, in fact Wiles did not succeed in eliminating it. With the passage of time ever more persistent news of the gap spread within the mathematical community and also in the general papers such as the New York Times. Finally Wiles by means of e-mail communicated to the mathematical community that effectively there was a gap in the proof but that he expected to be able sort it out in a few weeks. After months of not being able to do so, and on the advice of a friend he decided to get help from an expert on the Kolyvagin-Flach method and he therefore contacted Richard Taylor. Taylor was one of the reviewers of the proof and was an ex-student of Wiles. They worked on the problem for many months, and towards the end of summer Wiles was demoralised to such a point as to propose to Taylor publicly declaring defeat, but Taylor convinced him to persevere at least until the end of September.

The 19th of September Wiles was analysing the Kolyvagin-Flach method seeking to understand why the method failed when he became aware that, although the method was insufficient in order to obtain a proof, it permitted a method called Iwasawa’s method to function. Iwasawa’s method had initially been utilised by Wiles for the proof but had been abandoned as insufficient. The same method, instead, utilised in conjunction with the Kolyvagin-Flach method, furnished a valid proof.&lt;/p&gt;

==The proof==
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The 25th of October Wiles gave two manuscripts to the press, in the first there was the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem and it carried his signature. The second manuscript specified some properties of some elliptic curves and was signed by Wiles and Taylor. The second manuscript served to prove a fundamental passage of the first manuscript. The publication of the manuscripts put an end to one of the most complex and difficult proofs that mathematics had ever developed.

Wiles and Taylor did not totally prove the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, in fact the proof for all the cases arrived in 1999 by Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad, Fred Diamond, and the same Taylor, that starting from the work of Wiles incrementally proved the remaining cases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ronald Reagan, a Republican, took over the American presidency in 1981, from the Democrat Jimmy Carter. He believed that the USA had a special, God-ordained position in the world - that of an ambassador for freedom. Because of this, he immediately went on the offensive against world Communism, saying, in 1984 in Berlin:

{{cquote|Mr. Gorbachev, tear this wall down.}}

==Central America==
One way by which he seeked to accomplish this was by combatting the advance of Communism in Central America. In 1983, when Cuban-backed forces staged a coup on the small island of Grenada, Reagan diverted a troop carrier of marines, on their way to Israel, to invade the island. The invasion was a straight-forward success. Reagan also covertly backed rebels against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua for most of his presidency, despite opposition from both Congress and the Senate.

==SDI==
Reagan also went on the offensive in the Arms Race, instigating the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) in 1983. This was an attempt to develop a space-based missile defense system, which would allow the USA to shoot down any incoming missiles using lasers. It never succeeded, but it did bring the USSR to the bargaining table, as they could not afford to keep up with the Arms Race. Together with the Soviet financial problems, SDI ended the Cold War.

Is this incapability a feature of the XForms specification?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Bibliography==
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The development of this short book is based principally on the book: ''Fermat’s last theorem'' by Simon Singh ISBN 88-17-11291-7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The book is an explanatory text that, like this small volume, retraces the history of the theorem. The book studies in depth the history of the scientists who encountered Fermat’s theorem even in an indirect way and studies in depth in a clear manner the fundamental mathematical aspects without becoming excessively technical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;For the realization of this book pages from Wikipedia were also used as reference regarding Fermat’s Theorem, the bibliographies of the scientists listed in the book and the mathematical subjects discussed in the book. The appendix is based almost entirely on articles from Wikipedia. In particular the articles on Pythagoras Theorem, the Principle of Induction, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic and the article on Modular Arithmetic were used to realize the chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This appendix collects some proofs and studies in depth some mathematical concepts that can be interesting in order to examine in depth some aspects of the book. It seeks to maintain a simple approach but the proofs being correct, in some cases however it was necessary to make recourse to some non immediate concepts and passages that have been specified and clarified where possible.

==Pythagoras’ theorem==
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Being one of the most noted theorems in the history of mathematics, many proofs exist, the work of astronomers, stockbrokers, and even one by Leonardo da Vinci. Probably, together with quadratic reciprocity, it contends for the prize for the theorem with the most absolute proofs. It will be proved in a graphical manner utilising only the concepts of elementary geometry. Pythagoras’ proof will not be quoted being very complex and not immediate.&lt;/p&gt;

[[File:Pythagorean proof.png|centre]]
 
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The proof is very simple, as one sees from the graphic one constructs first a square formed by four triangles and by two squares, one of side '''a''' and the second of side '''b'''. The area of a square is calculated multiplying the side by itself or in modern notation the area is the side raised to the power two. The area of the large square is therefore the sum of the areas of the squares values ''a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' plus the sum of the four triangles. In the second square we have again four triangles and a square of area ''c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. The four triangles being present both to the left of the equality and to the right can be eliminated. Therefore remaining in the equation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;''a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;As one wished to prove. It is to be noted that the proof is generic and effectively covers every possible right angled triangle given that numbers are not utilised in the proof but only generic segments length '''a''', '''b''' and '''c'''. The proof depends solely on the fact that the triangles are right angled and on the fact that one is utilising Euclidean geometry.
This is a small gallery of some geometrical proofs of the theorem even if as was said above there are very many proofs and in fact there are also purely algebraic proofs, proofs that utilise complex numbers and even proofs written in the form of sonnets.&lt;/p&gt;

==Fundamental theory of arithmetic==
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The fundamental theory of arithmetic states that every natural number that is not 1 admits one and only one factorisation in prime numbers not taking account of the order of the factors. (The exclusion of 1 is due to the fact that it does not have prime factors.) This theorem was the basis of the proofs of Gabriel Lamé and Augustin Luis Cauchy and as was said in general is not valid for complex numbers therefore it cannot be utilised for Fermat’s theorem but given its importance it was decided however to include the proof in the appendix.
The statement is easily verifiable for “small” natural numbers: it is easy to discover that 70 is equal to ''2 &amp;times; 5 &amp;times; 7'' while 100 equates to ''2 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; 5 &amp;times; 5'' or ''2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', and furthermore it is easy to verify that for these numbers other decompositions into prime factors cannot exist. Conversely the general proof is rather longer: Here is an extract of it. It deals with a proof for absurd: that is it starts from the hypothesis contrary to that of the statement in order to be able to prove it unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;One supposes that there exist some number reducible into prime factors in more than one way, and one calls the smallest ''m''. Firstly one proves that, given two factorisations of ''m'', the prime numbers that present themselves in the first factorisation are all distinct from those in the second factorisation. They are in fact two different factorisations:&lt;/p&gt;

{{eqn|1}}
:&lt;math&gt;m = p_1 p_2 p_3 \dots p_s&lt;/math&gt; 

{{eqn|2}}
:&lt;math&gt;m = q_1 q_2 q_3 \dots q_t&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''q&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' are prime. ('''Note:''' within a single factorisation there can be repeated factors, naturally: for example, ''100 = 2 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; 5 &amp;times; 5''). Were there to be an identical factor ''p&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; = q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', we could divide ''m'' by such a factor and obtain a number ''m' '', less than ''m'', that would also itself have two distinct factorisations.
At this point we know that ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is different from ''q&lt;/sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''; without loss of generality we can suppose that ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''. We put then

{{eqn|3}}
:&lt;math&gt; n = (q_1-p_1)q_2 q_3\dots q_t &lt;/math&gt; 

Evidently, ''n &lt; m'', given that '''[3]''' can be written as:

{{eqn|4}}
:&lt;math&gt;n = q_1 q_2 q_3 \dots q_t - p_1 q_2 q_3 \dots q_t = m - p_1 q_2 q_3 \dots q_t\;\!&lt;/math&gt;. 

We now demonstrate that ''n'' admits at least two distinct factorisations.
We begin by considering if the first factor of ''n'', ''q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', can or cannot be prime; in the case that it was not, we suppose factorising it. The factorisation of ''n'' thus obtained does not admit ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' among its factors. In fact, from the first part of the proof, we know that ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is different from ''q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, q&lt;/sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,  q&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''; but it cannot none the less appear in the eventual factorisation of ''q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  - p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''. If in fact it happened that would mean that

:&lt;math&gt;q_1-p_1= p1\cdot b \Rightarrow q_1 = p_1(1+b) &lt;/math&gt;
 
and therefore ''q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' would be divisible by ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', which is not possible in as much as ''q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a prime number.
Taking now the final equality '''[4]''' and substituting for ''m'' the value from '''[1]''', we obtain:

{{eqn|5}}
:&lt;math&gt;n= p_1p_2p_3\dots p_s-p_1q_2q_3\dots q_t \rightarrow  n = p_1(p_2p_3\dots p_s- q_2q_3\dots q_t)&lt;/math&gt; 

In whatever way the second factor in '''[5]''', may be factorised, we will have obtained a factorisation of ''n'' that contains ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', and that therefore is different from that in '''[3]''', contrary to the hypothesis that ''m'' was the smallest number that admitted more than one factorisation.
The theorem is therefore proved.

== Principle of Induction ==
The Principle of induction states that 
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt; of natural numbers that satisfy the following two properties:
* &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;,
* every time that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; contains a number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; contains also the successive number &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt;,
then &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; coincides with all of the set of natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is found in general within the axioms of Peano and furnishes a potent instrument for proofs in all sectors of mathematics. In the book it is recalled at times given that many mathematicians have sought to prove a base case of Fermat's theorem and then of generalising the solution in order to be able include therein the successive cases by means of this principle.

=== Proof by induction ===
In order to prove that a certain assertion &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; in which appears a natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; valid for whatver &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb N&lt;/math&gt; one must apply the principle of induction in the following way:

One puts &lt;math&gt;U=\{n\in \mathbb N: \mbox{vale } P(n)\}&lt;/math&gt;,
# one proves &lt;math&gt;P(0)&lt;/math&gt; as valid, that is that &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is in the set of natural numbers &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is valid;
# one assumes as a hypothesis that the assertion &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; may be valid for a generic  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and from such an assumption one also proves that &lt;math&gt;P(n+1)&lt;/math&gt; (that is that &lt;math&gt;n\in U \Rightarrow n+1\in U&lt;/math&gt;)
and therefore one concludes that the set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of numbers for which &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is valid is valid coincides with all the set of natural numbers.
Point 1 is generally called '''base of the induction''', point 2 '''the inductive step'''.

The following is an intuitive mode in which one can look at this type of proof: if we have available a proof of the ''base'' &lt;math&gt;P(0)&lt;/math&gt; of the ''inductive step'' &lt;math&gt;P(n) \Rightarrow P(n+1)&lt;/math&gt; then clearly we can make use of these proofs in order to prove &lt;math&gt;P(1)&lt;/math&gt; using the logical rule modus ponens on &lt;math&gt;P(0)&lt;/math&gt; (the base) and &lt;math&gt;P(0) \Rightarrow P(1)&lt;/math&gt; (which is a particular case of the inductive step for  &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt;), then we can prove &lt;math&gt;P(2)&lt;/math&gt; since now we are using the modus ponens on &lt;math&gt;P(1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(1) \Rightarrow P(2)&lt;/math&gt;, thus for &lt;math&gt;P(3)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P(4)&lt;/math&gt;, etcetera... it is clear at this point that we can produce a proof in a finite number of steps (eventually very lengthy) of &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; for whatever natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, from which we deduce that &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is true for every  &lt;math&gt;n \in \N&lt;/math&gt;.

===An example===
We will prove that the following formula is valid:
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
: For every &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;0+1+2+3+4+...+n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this case we have &lt;math&gt;P(n) \quad \equiv \quad 0+1+2+3+4+...+n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.
* ''Base base of the induction'': we have to prove the assertion &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is true for &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt;, and so, substituting, that &lt;math&gt;0=\frac{0\cdot 1}2&lt;/math&gt;, and in effect there is very little work, one is talking of an elementary calculation;
* ''Inductive step'': we must show that for every ''n'' the implication &lt;math&gt;P(n)\Rightarrow P(n+1)&lt;/math&gt; is valid, that is, substituting:
:&lt;math&gt;0+1+2+3+4+...+n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 0+1+2+3+4+...+n+(n+1)=\frac{(n+1)((n+1)+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore we must assume as true 
:&lt;math&gt;P(n) \quad \equiv \quad 0+1+2+3+4+...+n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, 
working on this equality and concluding with the analogous equality for &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt;:
We could for example add &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; to both sides of the equality ''P(n)'':
:&lt;math&gt;0+1+2+3+4+...+n+(n+1)=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}+(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;, 
then we make some simple algebraic steps:
:&lt;math&gt;0+1+2+3+4+...+n+(n+1)=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}+\frac{2(n+1)}2&lt;/math&gt;, 
:&lt;math&gt;0+1+2+3+4+...+n+(n+1)=\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;0+1+2+3+4+...+n+(n+1)=\frac{(n+1)((n+1)+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt; 
and this final equality is exactly &lt;math&gt;P(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;. This concludes the proof of the ''inductive step''.

Having therefore proved the base of the induction and the inductive step we can conclude (from the principle of induction) that &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; must be true for every &lt;math&gt;n\in \mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

==Modular Arithmetic==
Modular arithmetic (sometimes called clock arithmetic since the calculation of the hours in cycles of 12 or 24 is based on such principle) represents an important branch of mathematics. It finds applications in cryptography, in the theory of numbers (in particular in the research of prime numbers), and it is the basis of many of the most common arithmetical and algebraic operations.
It deals with a system of integer arithmetic, in which the numbers &quot;wrap round on themselves &quot; every time that they reach multiples of a specific number ''n'', called the modulo. Modular arithmetic was formally introduced by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his treatise Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, published in 1801.
Modular arithmetic is based on the concept of '''congruence modulo ''n'' '''. Given three whole numbers ''a'', ''b'', ''n'', with ''n''≠0, we say that ''a'' and ''b'' are congruent modulo ''n'' if their difference (''a−b'') is a multiple of ''n''. In this case we write

:&lt;math&gt; a \equiv b \pmod{n} &lt;/math&gt;

and we say that ''a'' is ''congruent'' to ''b'' modulo ''n''. For example, we can write

:&lt;math&gt; 38 \equiv 14 \pmod{12} &lt;/math&gt;
 
since 38 − 14 = 24, which is a multiple of 12.
In the case that both numbers are positive, one can also say that ''a'' and ''b'' are congruent modulo ''n'' if they have the same remainder from division by ''n''. Therefore we can also say that 38 is congruent 14 modulo 12 since both 38 and 14 have remainder 2 after division by 12.

===Properties of congruence===
Congruence is a relationship of equivalence between integer numbers as one sees from the following properties:
*'''Reflexive property:''' every number is congruent to itself modulo ''n'', for every ''n'' different from fixed 0.

::&lt;math&gt; a \equiv a \pmod{n} \qquad \forall a \in \mathbb{N},\forall n \in \mathbb{N}_0 &lt;/math&gt;
 
::''Proof'': one has ''a - a'' = 0. But as is noted, every non-zero integer is a divisor of 0. Therefore ''n'' divides ''(a - a)''

*'''Symmetrical property:''' if ''a'' is congruent to ''b'' modulo ''n'' then ''b'' is congruent to ''a'' modulo ''n''

::&lt;math&gt; a \equiv b \pmod{n} \Rightarrow b \equiv a \pmod{n} \qquad \forall a,b \in \mathbb{N},\forall n \in \mathbb{N}_0 &lt;/math&gt;
 
::''Proof'': if ''n'' divides (''a - b''), then ''n'' also divides the opposite (''b - a'') = - (''a - b''

*'''Transitive property:''' if ''a'' is congruent to ''b'' modulo ''n'' and ''b'' is congruent to ''c'' modulo ''n'' then also ''a'' is congruent to ''c'' modulo ''n''.

::&lt;math&gt; a \equiv b \pmod{n} \quad\land\quad b \equiv c \pmod{n} \Rightarrow a \equiv c \pmod{n} \qquad \forall a,b,c \in \mathbb{N},\forall n \in \mathbb{N}_0 &lt;/math&gt;
 
::''Proof'': if ''n'' divides (''a - b'') and ''n'' divides (''a - c'') then, because of the distributive property of the division with respect to the subtraction, ''n'' also divides ''[(a - c) - (a - b)]=[a - c - a + b] = (b - c)''.

===Invariance with respect to arithmetical operations===
Another important characteristic of the relationship of congruence is the fact of being preserved by the usual arithmetical operations between integers:

*'''Invariance by addition''': increasing or reducing two numbers congruent modulo ''n'' by the same quantity, the new numbers obtained are still congruent between themselves modulo ''n''. More synthetically 

::&lt;math&gt; a \equiv b \pmod{n} \Leftrightarrow (a + c ) \equiv (b + c) \pmod{n} \qquad \forall a,b,c \in \mathbb{N},\forall n \in \mathbb{N}_0 &lt;/math&gt;
 
::''Proof'': we write ''(a - b)'' = ''(a - b + c - c) = ''(a + c) - (b + c)

*'''Invariance by multiplication''': multiplying two numbers congruent modulo ''n'' by the same quantity, the new numbers obtained are still congruent between themselves modulo ''n''.

::&lt;math&gt; a \equiv b \pmod{n} \Rightarrow a\cdot c \equiv b \cdot c \pmod{n} \qquad \forall a,b,c \in \mathbb{N},\forall n \in \mathbb{N}_0 &lt;/math&gt;
 
::''Proof'': if ''n'' divides ''(a - b)'' then ''n'' divides ''(a - b)×c'' 
::''Note'': One can only invert this property if ''n'' does not divide ''c'', that is if ''c'' is not congruent to 0 (modulo ''n'').
 
*'''Invariance with respect to raising to a power''': raising two numbers congruent modulo ''n'' to the same power ''k'', the numbers obtained are still congruent between themselves modulo ''n''.

::&lt;math&gt; a \equiv b \pmod{n} \Rightarrow a^{k} \equiv b^{k} \pmod{n} \qquad \forall a,b,c \in \mathbb{N},\forall k \in \mathbb{N},\forall n \in \mathbb{N}_0 &lt;/math&gt;
 
::''Proof'': if ''a ≡ b ≡ 0 (mod n)'' the proposition is banal. If ''a ≡ b (mod n)'' is non null, we suppose to know that &lt;math&gt;a^{k-1}\equiv b^{k-1} \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Multiplying both the terms by ''a'' thanks to invariance by multiplication, we will have &lt;math&gt;a^{k}\equiv b^{k-1}\cdot a \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt;. We start now from the congruence ''a ≡ b (mod n)'' and we multiply both the members by &lt;math&gt; b^{k-1} \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt;, thanks always to invariance by multiplication. We obtain:&lt;math&gt;a\cdot b^{k-1}\equiv b^{k} \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Comparing the two expressions, and utilising the symmetrical and transitive properties, one deduces that &lt;math&gt;a^{k}\equiv b^{k} \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the proposition is true for ''k = 1'' and the fact that it may be true for ''k-1'' implies that it is true for ''k'', by the principle of induction the proposition is true for every ''k''.

:: '''Note''': This property can be inverted only if ''k'' is not 0.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Description ==
Calibration of the camera system with a second order linear system.
The non-linear transformation from image pixels to world coordinates is approximated by a second-order, non-symmetric polynomial of the form

&lt;math&gt;x = a_{11}u+a_{12}v+a_{13}+a_{14}u^2+a_{15}v^2+a_{16}uv&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y = a_{21}u+a_{22}v+a_{23}+a_{24}u^2+a_{25}v^2+a_{26}uv&lt;/math&gt;

with u, v the image pixels, and x, y the coordinates in world space (meters).
The twelve parameters of this-very simple model-are estimated in a least-square fashion from a 
sufficiently large number of coordinate pairs. Thus, the software has to be provided with a number 
of image points which positions in the real world are known -- for instance by using a pattern of known 
dimensions. Hereby, increasing the number of pairs used in the estimation process over the minimum of six moderates the effect of noisy measurements during calibration.

Also, one observes that the precision of the approximation and hence the precision of the prediction 
is higher in the neighborhood of the training points. By that, we are able to bias the region within 
the camera frame where we want to minimize the prediction area.

== Input ==

Particles.

== Output ==

Particles.

== Parameters ==

=== Calib. Points ===

Path the XML file containing the calibration points. The file must have the following format:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;pointlist&gt;
  &lt;points&gt;
    &lt;point&gt;
      &lt;xworld&gt;0.3&lt;/xworld&gt;
      &lt;yworld&gt;0.9&lt;/yworld&gt;
      &lt;ximage&gt;9.8&lt;/ximage&gt;
      &lt;yimage&gt;10.3&lt;/yimage&gt;
    &lt;/point&gt;
    &lt;point&gt;
      &lt;xworld&gt;34.1&lt;/xworld&gt;
      &lt;yworld&gt;7.9&lt;/yworld&gt;
      &lt;ximage&gt;44.3&lt;/ximage&gt;
      &lt;yimage&gt;25.9&lt;/yimage&gt;
    &lt;/point&gt;
  &lt;/points&gt;
&lt;/pointlist&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

More points can be added like the the two in this example. A minimum of 6 non-collinear points is needed to compute the calibration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Paul Wolfskehl==
The works of Kummer on the factorisation of complex numbers threw a general mistrust on the possibility of finding a proof of Fermat’s theorem in a reasonable time. The researches also halted because of the birth of new branches of mathematics that drew the studious away from the theory of numbers. In 1908 Paul Wolfskehl gave a new impulse to the researches. Wolfskehl was a German industrialist from Darmstadt who came from a very rich family dedicated to patronage of the arts. Paul had studied at mathematical university and, although he had greater success in business than in mathematics, his contribution was decisive in reawakening interest in the theorem. Wolfskehl at that period was in love with a woman who refused his every attention. Driven by despondency Wolfskehl had decided to commit suicide at the stroke of midnight, but being a meticulous and precise person he had planned everything and had provided an adequate arrangement of his affairs and a salutation of his closest friends by means of letters. Wolfskehl had finished the preparations before midnight and in order to pass the time began to thumb through some texts on mathematics. In particular thumbing through the work of Kummer he noted an unproved assumption. If that assumption revealed itself in reality false perhaps it would have reopened the possibility of proving Fermat’s theorem with the method of Lamé or of Cauchy. Wolfskehl worked all night and finally succeeded in proving that the assumption was true and therefore the proof was correct. This was bad news for the mathematician but Wolfskehl was so happy to have been able to correct the great Kummer that he regained faith in himself. He abandoned the proposal of suicide and instead wrote a second will according to which he would have left a good part of his patrimony to whoever was able to prove Fermat’s theorem. The will became operative in 1908 and the Royal Society of Science of Göttingen became the organisation proposed for the verification of proofs that aspired to the prize. The prize was announced by all the European mathematical publications and thousands of aspiring mathematicians choked the university of Göttingen with presumed proofs of Fermat’s theorem. Unfortunately the prize did not attract many serious mathematicians, given that these were well aware of the extreme difficulty of the problem and therefore it did not produce a real turn-about in the field of mathematics, but it had the merit of rendering the problem of Fermat’s last theorem famous to the public at large.

[[Image:Augustin_Louis_Cauchy.JPG|thumb|200px|Picture of Cauchy]]
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Sophie Germain’s results appeared to many to be the turning point, and that the definitive solution of the enigma was close. The French Academy of Science offered a series of prizes to whoever succeeded in proving Fermat’s last theorem. In that epoch the offer of prizes for the solution of mathematical enigmas was a common practice followed by many academies, given that one was thus able to direct the research of many scientists into specific areas of knowledge. These prizes were used whether for research into the solutions of practical problems or for the solution of theoretical problems such as Fermat’s theorem. The mathematicians Gabriel Lamé and Augustin Luis Cauchy announced being on the point of proving the theorem utilising similar techniques. These mathematicians set the Parisian salons on fire with statements and extracts of their respective proofs but without ever publishing the complete proofs. This situation dragged on for the whole of the month of April 1847 until the mathematician Joseph Lionville read to the academy of science a letter from the mathematician Ernst Eduard Kummer. Kummer analysing the few pieces of evidence on the proofs of Cauchy and Lamé had become aware that the proofs followed the same reasoning and that they contained a logical error that rendered them fallacious. Kummer had become aware that the two mathematicians had based their proof on a property known as unique factorisation. This stated in substance that every integer number could be broken down into a single series of prime numbers. Known since the times of Euclid (fourth century B.C.) it was used in very many proofs and is so important that the theorem that enunciated it is called the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. The problem was that the proof of Cauchy and Lamé utilised complex numbers and, in the field of complex numbers, this property is not necessarily true. The lack of unique factorisation could have been worked round with some techniques but however there remained some recalcitrant numbers. These numbers could in theory have been faced singly, but being infinite that would not have resolved the problem. Lamé became aware of the impossibility of finding a general solution, while Cauchy held his implementation not so dependent on factorisation and worked for several weeks on the subject before giving up. Finally, in 1856, seeing that no correct solution had been presented to the academy, it decided to withdraw the prize. It still in fact lacked 138 years to the final solution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Semantics==
==Definition 4 (Semantics of predicate logic - Interpretation)==
An interpretation is a pair &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} = (U_\mathcal{I}, A_\mathcal{I})&lt;/math&gt;, where
  
*&lt;math&gt;U_\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary nonempty set, called domain, or universe. 
*&lt;math&gt;A_\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; is a mapping which associates to        
**a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-ary predicate symbol, a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-ary predicate over &lt;math&gt;U_\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;,   
**a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-ary function symbol, a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-ary function over &lt;math&gt;U_\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;, and    
**a variable an element from the domain.   
*: 

Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a formula and  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} = (U_\mathcal{I}, A_\mathcal{I})&lt;/math&gt; be an
interpretation. We call &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; an interpretation for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, if
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; is defined for every predicate and function symbol, and for
every variable, that occurs free in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; .


Example: Let &lt;math&gt;F= \forall x p(x,f(x)) \land q(g(a,z))&lt;/math&gt; and
assume the varieties of the  symbols as written down. In the following
we give two interpretations for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;:
  
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_1 = (N_0,A_1)&lt;/math&gt;, such that        
**&lt;math&gt;A_1(p) = \{ (m,n) \mid m,n \in N_0 \text{ and } m &lt; n\}&lt;/math&gt; 
**&lt;math&gt;A_1(q) = \{ n \in N_0 \mid n \text{ is prime} \}&lt;/math&gt;   
**&lt;math&gt;A_1(f)(n) = n+1 \; \forall n \in N_0&lt;/math&gt; 
**&lt;math&gt;A_1(g)(m,n) = m+n \; \forall n,m \in N_0&lt;/math&gt;   
**&lt;math&gt;A_1(a) = 2&lt;/math&gt; 
**&lt;math&gt;A_1(z) = 3&lt;/math&gt;   
*:  Under this interpretation the formula &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; can be read as &quot; Every natural number is smaller than its successor and the sum of &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; is a prime number.&quot; 
*  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}_2 = (U_2,A_2)&lt;/math&gt;, such that       
**&lt;math&gt;U_2= \{a, f(a), g(a,a), f(g(a,a)), g(f(a),f(a)), \cdots \}&lt;/math&gt; 
**&lt;math&gt;A_2(f)(t) = f(t)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t \in U_2&lt;/math&gt;   
**&lt;math&gt;A_2(g)(t_1,t_2) = g(t_1,t_2)&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;t_1,t_2 \in U_2&lt;/math&gt;

For a given interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}= (U,A)&lt;/math&gt; we write in the following
&lt;math&gt;p^\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;A(p)&lt;/math&gt;; the same abbreviation will be used for
the assignments for function symbols and variables.

==Definition 5 (Semantics of predicate logic - Evaluation of Formulae)==

Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a formula and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; an interpretation for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. For terms &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;
which can be composed with symbols from &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; the value &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is given
by 
  
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(x)= x^\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; 
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(f(t_1, \cdots , t_k)) = f^\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{I}(t_1), \cdots , \mathcal{I}(t_k))&lt;/math&gt;, if  &lt;math&gt;t_1, \cdots, t_k&lt;/math&gt; are terms and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-ary function symbol. (This    holds for the case &lt;math&gt;k=0&lt;/math&gt; as well.) 
The value &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(F)&lt;/math&gt; of a formula &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is given by
  
*&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{I}(p(t_1, \cdots, t_k)) =  
\begin{cases} 
\;\;\,true &amp; \text{ if }  (\mathcal{I}(t_1), \cdots, \mathcal{I}(t_k))\in p^\mathcal{I} \\
\;\;\,false &amp; \; otherwise  
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

 
*&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{I}(F\land G)) =  
\begin{cases} 
\;\;\,true &amp; \text { if } \mathcal{I}(F) = true { and }  \mathcal{I}(G) = true \\
\;\;\,false&amp;  otherwise  
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;  
*&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{I}((F\lor G)) =  
\begin{cases} 
\;\;\,true &amp; \text { if } \mathcal{I}(F) = true { or }  \mathcal{I}(G) = true \\
\;\;\, false&amp; otherwise  
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{I}(\lnot F) =  \begin{cases} 
\;\;\,true &amp; \text { if } \mathcal{I}(F) = false \\
\;\;\, false&amp; otherwise  \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt; 
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(\forall G) =  \begin{cases} 
\;\;\,true &amp; \text{ if for every } d\in U\; : \; \mathcal{I}_{[x/d]}(G) = true \\
\;\;\, false&amp; otherwise  \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;  
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(\exists G) =  \begin{cases} 
\;\;\,true &amp; \text{ if there is  a }    d\in U\; : \; \mathcal{I}_{[x/d]}(G) = true \\
\;\;\, false&amp; otherwise  \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt; 

where, &lt;math&gt;  f_{[x/d]}(y) =  
\begin{cases}
\;\;\, f(y)&amp; \text{ if  }  x \neq y \\
\;\;\, d   &amp;  otherwise \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
The notions of satisfiable, valid, and &lt;math&gt;\models &lt;/math&gt;  are defined
according to the propositional case ([[Logic for Computer Scientists/Propositional Logic/Semantics|Semantic (Propositional logic)]]).


Note that, predicate calculus is an extension of propositional
calculus: Assume only &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;-ary predicate symbols and a formula which
contains no variable, i.e. there can be no terms and no quantifier in
a well-formed formula.

On the other hand, predicate calculus can be extended: If one allows
for quantifications over predicate and function symbols, we arrive at
a second order predicate calculus. E.g. 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \forall p \exists f \; p(f(x))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 
Another example for a second order formula of is the induction principle from [[Logic for Computer Scientists/Induction|Induction]].

==Problems==
====Problem 1 (Predicate)====

The interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} = \text{ is given } (U_\mathcal{I}, A_\mathcal{I}) &lt;/math&gt; as follows:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
U_\mathcal{I}  =  \N  
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;
p^\mathcal{I}  = { (m,n) \mid m &lt; n } 
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;
f^\mathcal{I}(m,n)  =  m+n 
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;
x^\mathcal{I} = 5  ;  y^\mathcal{I} = 7
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Determine the value of following terms and formulae:
                      
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(f(f(x,x),y))&lt;/math&gt; 
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(\forall x \forall y (p(x,y) \lor p(y,x))&lt;/math&gt;             
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(p(x,x) \to p(y,x))&lt;/math&gt; 
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(\exists x  p(y,x))&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

====Problem 2 (Predicate)====


The interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} = \text{ is  given } (U_\mathcal{I},A_\mathcal{I})&lt;/math&gt; as follows:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 
U_\mathcal{I}  =  \R &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
P^\mathcal{I}  =  { z \mid z \geq 0 } &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;math&gt;
f^\mathcal{I}(z)  =  z^2  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
x^\mathcal{I}  = \sqrt{2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
E^\mathcal{I}  =  { (x,y) \mid x=y } &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
g^\mathcal{I}(x,y)  =  x+y  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
y^\mathcal{I}  =  -1 
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Determine the value of following terms and formulae:

&lt;math&gt; 
1. \mathcal{I}(g(f(x),f(y)))&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;
2. \mathcal{I}(\forall x\,P(f(x)))&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3. \mathcal{I}(\exists z \forall x \forall y\,E(g(x,y),z)) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; 4.  \mathcal{I}(\forall y (E(f(x),y) \to P(g(x,y)))) &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

====Problem 3 (Predicate)====

The following formula is given:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; F= \forall x \forall y \forall z\,R(h(h(x,y),z),h(x,h(y,z)))
    \ \land\ \exists x \exists y\,\lnot R(h(x,y),h(y,x)) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Indicate a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt;, which is a model for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and
a structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; which is no model for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;!
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

== Permanent Block ==

You have been permanently blocked from editing Wikibooks for apparent vandalism.  There have been many cases of vandalism within the past hour and I believe you were a part of it but it's difficult to see at the moment from your edits if this is correct.  Once all vandalism has been reverted and deleted I will fully check your contributions and unblock you if I believe I have made a mistake.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[wikipedia:en:Same-sex marriage|Same-sex marriage]] is a controversy that is part of the family values issue, and is related to homosexuality and marriage disputes.

''Supporters:'' Those who believe that legal authorities should recognize the validity of marriages between two men or two women.  

''Opponents:'' Those who believe that legal authorities should only recognize the validity of marriages between one man and one woman.

==Opinions==

===Unfair discrimination===

===Religion===

'''Opponents:''' God has created the institution of marriage for the purpose of procreation.  Same-sex couples are incapable of procreating.
:''This argument relies on the premise that God created marriage for the purpose of procreation.
''This argument relies on the premise that God exists''

'''Supporters:''' Not all couples procreate, some by choice and others because they are infertile.  Nobody argues that infertile couples should not be allowed to marry.

'''Supporters:''' God desires that all people lead romantically and sexually fulfilling lives.  The best way to do so is by committing to a monogamous relationship with a compatible person.  For homosexuals, the most sexually and romantically compatible people are of the same sex. 
:''This argument is part of the nature vs. nurture debate.''

'''Supporters:''' Marriage is a religious institution defined by religious rules.  In a country where there is separation between church and state marriage should not be recognized as an institution in law whatsoever.

===Family Values===

'''Opponents:''' Allowing same-sex marriage will contribute to the breakdown of the family unit in society.  The end result will be more single-parent families and more instability in the lives of children.

:''This argument relies on claims regarding homosexuality and parenting.

'''Supporters:''' There is no evidence to indicate that same-sex couples are poorer parents then heterosexual couples.  In addition, marriage will make families headed by homosexual couples more stable, not less so, and will have no impact on the parenting abilities of heterosexual couples.

:''This argument relies on claims regarding homosexuality and parenting.

'''Supporters:''' If things that weaken the family unit in society must be illegal, then divorce should by the same token be illegal, and it's not.

:''This argument assumes that the existence of divorce is accepted by all.
:''This argument assumes that the existence of one anti-family feature of our law can justify another anti-family feature.

'''Opponents:''' Critical court decisions in support of parental rights have been based on the structure of the traditional family in common law. If the definition of marriage were to change, these court decisions would be in jeopardy.
:''This argument assumes that the said court decision should be upheld.''
:''This argument assumes that the said court decision could not be interpreted to include same-sex parents.''

'''Opponents:''' Much of this battle is about financial and legal advantages given to families. While childless couples do benefit, the advantages have been fairly successful in improving the lives of children. These advantages apply to all of us, because even homosexuals start life as children.

===Definition===

'''Opponents:''' Marriage traditionally has meant the union of one man and one woman. Homosexual unions can be classed more or less with polygamy, in that advocates want to change the definition. And if the definition can be changed for homosexuals, why would any other limits be different?

:''This argument ignores the fact that there are documentations of historic same-sex marriages in Ancient Rome and some African tribes.
:''This argument can be considered an example of a Slippery Slope argument.
:''This argument is based on the assumption that multiple legal marriages should not exist.

'''Supporters:''' Gay marriage is unrelated to polygamous relationships.  It is possible to logically examine the evidence and conclude that one is immoral and the other not.

:''This argument could well go either way. There are multiple cases of polygamy in the Bible. Thus, if we are to decide which type of marriage is immoral by examining evidence, we may conclude that same-sex marriage is immoral.''
::''There are only hinted biblical reference to homosexuality in the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.''
::''This con-argument assumes that the Bible is the one source from which moral laws should be taken.''

===Distinction===
There is a distinction to be made between religious marriage and the government institution of marriage. Some religious institutions forbid same-sex marriage and some allow them. The question is whether or not the state should or should not recognize same-sex marriages.

Some people would break away from both camps on this debate and argue that the state institution of marriage should not exist altogether. They would argue that regardless of whether same-sex marriages are recognize by the state, the state institution of marriage amounts to the government determining how people are to live their lives by providing social and economic incentives to organize a particular model of family unit.

There are plenty of ways of organizing a family unit other than a heteronormative couple that are already in existence, and not all of these are based around two adults who are sexually and romantically attracted to each other. For instance [[w:Intentional Community|collectives]] often raise children together. Regardless of whether the adult members are attracted to each other, this is a type of family unit that is held together by love. There is no reason, then, why members of a collective should be denied access to the privileges afforded heteronormative couples: for instance, hospital visitation rights.

&lt;hr&gt;

Iran forms a distinct parallelogram in the east part of the region most commonly known as the Middle East or West Asia. It is located between 32 00 N latitude and 53 00 E longitude. It has torrid plains, hot deserts and tall mountain peaks.Its history and culture is completely different from other countries of the Middle East, save Iraq which makes one wonder as to why it has been classified as a part of West Asia.

== Geography ==

&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Iran_BMNG.png|300px|right]]
&lt;/p&gt;

Most of the terrain is mountainous, with the Zagros chain extending from the north-west to the south-east and the Elburz Mountains extending all along the Caspian coastline in the north. Throughout history, the two mountain ranges have often acted as a physical barrier protecting the Iranian heartland from the marauding Turkish hordes of the north and the Arabs of the south. As a result, this region has been the one least affected by foreign invasions. Though Iran had been invaded by foreigners from time to time the evil effects of conquest were often felt only in the plains of the south while the north was relatively less influenced. The Elburz mountains have, in fact, sheltered innumerable revolutionaries, freedom-fighters and banditti and was a stronghold of a declining Zoroastrian religion well into the sixteenth century. 

The two mountain ranges meet at Tabriz, beside Lake Urmia in the Iranian portion of Azerbaijan. Lake Urmia,situated at the head of the Zagros Range, is asscoiated with numerous Persian legends and was a part of the original homeland of the Avestan people.

To the south of Azerbaijan, is the country of the Kurdish tribes (''Pers. Kordestan''). 

To the south of Kurdistan, the Zagros range curves to the right and runs parallel to the sea enclosing a narrow tract of land between the mountains and the coastline. This province known as Khuzestan with its capital at Ahvaz is the region where most of Iran's 1.5 million Arabs live.

Southern Iran, historically known as Persia, comprises roughly the areas of modern-day Khuzestan, Fars and Kirman. This is a region of great antiquity known for its culture and civilization. This was the centre of the Achaemenid and Sassanian Empires with the ruins of a magnificent Persepolis adorning its scorched terrain. Now, it seems difficult for us to imagine that this was once the centre of a mighty empire which ruled most of the known world. 

To the east of Fars, lies Hormuzgan province, which comprises the island of Hormuz or Qeshm and the adjacent coastline of southern Persia. This forms the easternmost limit of Persia proper.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Origins ==


The Elamites called their country ''Haltamti'' meaning 'highland' which the Akkadians rendered as Elam. Some people believe that the Elamites are the descendants of Elam, the eldest son of Shem of the Old Testament and hence the name.

== Proto-Elamite ==

The period  between 3200 and 2700BC when the Elamite civilization gradually evolved is known as proto-Elamite period. This was the period when the Jiroft and Zayandeh Rud civilizations flourished in Iran. Tappeh Sialk is one of the prominent monuments of this period.

The script of the proto-Elamite people is yet to be deciphered and bears a striking resemblance to the Indus script.


== The Old Elamite Period 2700 - 1600BC ==

The Old Elamite period began in about 2700BC when King Peli commenced the Awan Dynasty of Elam. However around 2600BC, Elam was conquered by the legendary king Enmebargesi of Kish of whom we know from the Epic of Gilgamesh. Later, however, the Elamites established their independence and under the later Awans even controlled Sumer. But, there were also intermittent periods when Elam was on the decline and Sumerian rulers like Eannatum and Lugal-Ale-Mundu established their sovereignty over Elam. 

The Sumerian king lists mention three successive kings who reigned collectively for a period of 356 years. In 2350BC, Sargon of Akkad inflicted a crushing defeat on the forces of the Avan king Luhi-Ishan and degraded them to the level of vassals. The capital city of Anshan was however not reached by the Akkadians and under Kutik-Inshushinak (or Puzur-Inshushinak) in 2240BC, the Awans not only regained their freedom but even established their control over Sumeria. Kutuk-Inshushinak is described as a blood thirsty monarch who destroyed 70 cities a day. However, he is also credited with having revived Elamite rule in Northern Mesapotamia, Sumer and Akkad, improved the administration of the Elamite kingdom and having extended a temple dedicated to Inshushinak.

A hundred years after the Awan restoration, Elam was attacked by Ur-Nammu and his son Shulgi of Ur who put an end to the Awan dynasty. However, Elam regained its freedom under the Shimashki Dynasty whose kings concluded marriage alliances with the rulers of Ur.  In 2004BC, the Elamites allied with Susa and attacked Ur putting an end to the Third dynasty.

The Shimashkis were succeeded by the Eparti dynasty. Notable rulers of this dynasty include Sirukhdukh (c.1850BC),Siwe-Palar-Khuppak who was addressed as &quot;Father&quot; by Mesapotamian kings and Kudur-Nahhunte.


== Middle Elamite Period 1500-1100BC ==

The Middle Elamite Period is characterized by the integration of Susa into the Elamite Empire and adoption of the Elamite language in place of Akkadian by Susiana.

During the Middle Elamite period, three dynasties ruled the kingdom one after the other. They are the Kidinuid,who used the titles 'King of Susa and Anshan' and 'servant of Kirwashir',the Igihalkid and Shutrukid dynasties. The Igihalkids intermarried with the Kassites. In around 1320BC, the Kassite king Kurigalzu II occupied Elam and the Elamite power wasnt restored until 1240BC when Khiddin-Kutran I of Elam repulsed the Kassites.

[[Image:Choghazanbil2.jpg|300px|right]]
Under the Shutrukids (1210–1100BC), the Elamite empire reached the height of its power. Shutruk-Nakhkhunte who ruled from 1185BC to 1155BC was the greatest monarch of the Shutrukid dynasty. His three sons, Kutir-Nakhkhunte II, Shilhak-In-Shushinak, and Khutelutush-In-Shushinak were capable of frequent military campaigns into Kassite Mesopotamia, and at the same time were exhibiting vigorous construction activity -- building and restoring luxurious temples in Susa and across their Empire.

However, Shutruk-Nakhkhunte is famous today for the famous tablet inscription that he caused to be inscribed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am Shutruk Nahunte, King of Anshand and Susa, Sovereign of the land of Elam. I destroyed Sippar, took the stele of Naram-Sin, and brought it back to Elam, where I erected it as an offering to my god. Shutruk Nahunte - 1158 B.C.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1158BC, Shutru-Nakhkhunte defeated the Kassites of Babylon, killing their king and breaking their power permanently. Following the death of Shurtu-Nakhkhunte's son, Kutir-Nakhkhunte, Lgihalkid power began to decline rapidly.

== The Neo-Elamite Period 1100 - 539 BC ==

The Neo-Elamite period is further subdivided into Neo-Elamite I(1100-770BC),Neo-Elamite II(770-646BC) and Neo-Elamite III periods (646-539BC)

Very little is known about the Neo-Elamite I period. During this period, there seems to have been constant wars between the Elamites and Babylonians on one side and the Assyrians on the other.


The Neo-Elamite II period witnessed the migration of the present-day Iranians into the Iranian plateau. The first historical references to the Medes (Mada) date to 835BC when they are mentioned in an inscription of ShalmanesserII, King of Assyria, who relates that after having subjugated the Zimri who held the Zagros Mountains he lead an expedition to Media and defeated the Medes. The Assyrian chronicles also mention the Parsu or the Persians living on the south-eastern shore of Lake Urmia in the year 844BC.    

[[Image:Susa-destruction.jpg|300px|right]]

In the late 8th century BC, the Elamites allied with the Babylonian king Merodach-baladan against the Assyrians but were defeated by Shutruk-Nakhkhunte II (716-699BC) in 710BC. In 700BC, the Assyrian ruler Sennacherib dethroned Merodach-baladan and installed his own son on the Babylonian throne. Another battle was fought between the Babylonians and the Assyrians at Halule in 691BC which ended without either side achieving victory.

There was continuous warfare betweent the Elamites and the Assyrians during the reigns of Elamite monarchs Khumma-Kaldash I and Khumma-Kaldash II. Urtaku (674-664BC) maintained friendly relations with the Assyrians but during the end of his reign, the Elamites launched an invasion of Mespotamia and the Assyrian ruler Ashurbanipal responded by counter-attacking Elam and killing Urtaku's successor in 653BC. In this same year the Mede state to the north fell to the Scythians, immediately displacing the Parsu tribe to Anshan, which their king Teispes captured that same year. Civil war broke out in Elam and the government was rendered unstable. Perceiving his chance, Assurbanipal launched a massive invasion of Elam in 646BC and destroyed Susa altogether.In a tablet unearthed in 1854 by Henry Austin Layard, Ashurbanipal boasts of the destruction he had wrought:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Susa, the great holy city, abode of their Gods, seat of their mysteries, I conquered. I entered its palaces, I opened their treasuries where silver and gold, goods and wealth were amassed...I destroyed the ziggurat of Susa. I smashed its shining copper horns. I reduced the temples of Elam to naught; their gods and goddesses I scattered to the winds. The tombs of their ancient and recent kings I devastated, I exposed to the sun, and I carried away their bones toward the land of Ashur. I devastated the provinces of Elam and on their lands I sowed salt.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the destruction wrought wasnt so great as Assurbanipal claims in this inscription of his. The Elamites revived and ruled Susa till its conquest by Cyrus the Great in 539BC. This last period, when Elam was ruled by a set of weak kings is known as the Neo-Elamite III period.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Little is known about Iran prior to the rise of the Elamite power. This is so because there remains a treasure-trove of pre-historic artifacts and long-buried cities yet to be recovered. Only recently are Stone Age sites in Iran being excavated and observed. Therefore our knowledge of pre-historic Iran is quite scarce and is almost entirely based on modern discoveries and findings of the last few decades.

== Persia before the Elamites ==

== Paleolithic Period ==

By pre-historic Iran, we refer to the part of Iranian history from the date of Iran's oldest archaeological site discovered in Northern Iran and believed to be 800,000 years old upto the rise of the Elamites in around 3200BC when Iran becomes historical. The first part of Iran's pre-history would cover the Paleolithic Period or Stone Age. The earliest known evidence of hominin presence in Iran consist of a number of occurrences with surface collection of lithic tools that fall within Oldowan and Acheulian stone tool traditions. These sites are Kashafrud (Khorasan), Ladiz (Sistan and Baluchistan), Ganj Par and Darband Cave (Gilan), Shiwatoo (Mahabad), and few other sites in western Iran such as Amar Merdeg, Pal Barik and Gakia. Among these sites only Darband cave is dated radiometrically which indicate that the site was used by Lower Paleolithic hominins before 200.000 years ago.  As recent as November 2006,a team of Iranian and Russian archaeologists excavating in northern provinces of Ardabil, Gilan, Mazenderan and Golestan discovered 50 pre-historic sites, 30 of them in Ardabil alone, which contained old Stone-Age implements dating to sometime between 800,000 and a million years ago. Another set of recent excavations by a joint Iranian-French team of archaeologists revealed Neanderthal sites in Iran, 40000 to 85000 years old. These recent discoveries have been made in Kermanshah province and in Mahabad in Western Azerbaijan as well as Niasar in Luristan province where caves inhabited by pre-historic Neanderthals were found. Remnants of Neolithic or New Stone Age settlements have been found at Ganj Dareh, Sarab, Mushki and tepe Chaxmaq. These have been dated to 7000 to 10,000BC.

== Neolithic Age or early village period==

The Neolithic Age is often associated with the growth of farming and irrigation as the temperature and rainfall of the time was found to be suitable for agriculture. The Neolithic Age in Iran began in about 8000BC and ended by about 5500BC. The Neolithic Age in Iran was characterized by the growth of small settlements having 50-100 inhabitants who lived either in houses built of unbaked brick or tents or brush-shelters.However excavations are yet to reveal the existence of class differences and temples or other special structures.

The Early Neolithic Period (8000-7300BC) preceded the use of pottery. The tools were mostly made up of flint,wood or fiber. Figurines of sheep,cattle,dogs, pigs and people made from clay have been found. With the introduction of agriculture and expansion of villages, people started uysing clay to make pottery. Bracelets and pendants were often worn by the inhabitants. Tools for harvesting crops, butchering, working hides, and other tasks were made from flint, while grinding stones, mortars, and pestles were made from limestone. Native pure copper from the central Iranian plateau was hammered into beads and pins. 

Hajji Firuz, Abdul Hosein, Ali Kosh, Chogha Sefid, and Chogha Bonut are some of the prominent Neolithic Age sites that have been excavated.

== The Rise of Mesopotamia ==

Iran was directly affected by the rise and evolution of city-states in neighbouring Mesopotamia as its South-Western provinces were under the Mesopotamian sphere of influence. Between 5300BC when the neolithic Eridu culture originated till 539BC when Cyrus the Great of Persia put an end to the last of the Mesapotamian kingdoms, the frontier regions of Khuzestan and Kordestan formed a part of the Greater Mesopotamian culture. In about 3200 BC, the Elamites, the first Iranian people of any significance, established a kingdom in south-western Iran and ruled this region, sometimes as vassals, for over two thousand years.

=== Uruk ===

The Samarra Culture first use irrigation in northern Mesopotamia at 5500BC. There was walls rounded the villages.
The Chalcolithic Ubaid/Obeid or Eridu culture thrived from 5300 BC to 4000BC and pioneered farming and irrigation and the use of copper. Slowly villages grew into cities and Eridu civilization extended into Northern Mesopotamia. On late this period there was temples and some type chiefdoms.
The Eridu period was followed by the Uruk period which extended from 4000 to 3100 BC. This period saw the rise of one of the world's oldest cities from which Mesopotamia's modern name Iraq could have originated. There was big cities in northern Mesopotamia before southern mesopotamia, tex. Tell Brak in Syria. Writing was invented and large temples was built. These city-states were remarkable for their excellent organization and governance. By 3000BC, the government of Uruk had become powerful enough to subdue other city-states and give rise to the Sumerian Empire.

=== Early dynastic Sumer ===

The Empire of Sumer began with the Dynasty of Kish in around 3000BC. At this time there were widespread conflicts between many city-states.
One city conquered others, but soon was overthrown by another city.
By 2700 BC, the focus seems to have shifted from Kish to Uruk.  The Uruk and the Ur dynasties ruled from 2700BC to around 2500 BC when overlordship passed on to Lagash. In 2334 BC, the last of the Sumerian kings was overthrown by Sargon I of Akkad.

=== Akkad ===

Semitic Akkad established its supremacy over Mesopotamia and ruled the lands from 2334BC to around 2100BC. One of the early rulers of Akkad, Lugal-Zage-Si is credited with having established Akkadian supremacy over the Elamite kingdom based in south-west Iran. Sargon I, the first ruled after the conquest of Mesopotamia, is regarded as the greatest monarch of his dynasty. It is definitely possible that he might have exercised his authority over Iran proper as clay tablets belonging to his period makes references to copper being brought from Magan which most scholars believe, is modern Makran. Sargon's grandson Naram-Sin is credited with having led an expedition into Magan and having taken its monarch captive.

=== Gutians and Neo-Sumer ===

At around 2200BC, the Gutians invaded Mesopotamia from the Zagros Mountains. The first Guti kings had a barbaric manner to govern Sumer. They didn't repair irrigation canals those brought water to fields.
Lagash rebelled and became independent. Gudea of Lagash was a strong king, but had only local significance. Gutians still ruled most of Sumer. But Utukhegal, the king of Uruk, 
drove the Gutians off, and Ur became overlord of Sumer under Ur-Nammu, who commenced the third dynasty of Ur. This dynasty ruled Mesopotamia over hundred years. Shulgi was most famous king of Ur III dynasty.
This is known as the &quot;Sumerian Renaissance&quot; or Neo-Sumer. Temples were built and trade flourished. There were problems due the Amorite tribes on west.

But in Sumer there was a rebellion in the city of Lagash, that became independent. Soon after this Elam attacked till Sumer at 2004BC, and captured last king of Ur, Ibbi-Sin.

In Isin Ishbi-Erra-named semitic took power and drove the Elamites out from Sumer. Semitic Amorite tribes came to Sumer, and took power in many city states of Mesopotamia.

=== Old Babylonia ===

There was power struggle between Isin and Larsa at Southern Mesopotamia ca. 2000-1750BC. At 1750 BC the king of Babylon Hammurabi conquered most of present-day Iraq and made empire, that began collapse soon after his death.

=== The Kassites ===

The Kassites were a mountain tribe from Luristan who are believed to have migrated to the region from an obscure homeland sometime between 4000 and 3000 BC. It has often been thought that they were Indo-Europeans. But recent researches have established beyond doubt that their language was not Indo-European thereby disproving the theory that they were Indo-Europeans. 

In 1595BC, they rose into prominence, taking hold of Northern Mesapotamia. Following their attendance to power, they ruled Babylon for four centuries. Some prominent Kassite rulers were Kurigalzu I (1400-1375 BC appx.), who built a town named after him called Dur-Kurigalzu, Kadashman Enlil I, and Burnaburiash II, who maintained correspondence with Amenhotep III and Akenaton (Amenhotep IV) of Egypt. The Kassites princes married Assyrian, Hittite and Elamite princesses. In the 12th century BC Kassite rule was brought to an end by the invasion  of the Elamites who conquered Babylon and took the last Kassite ruler, Anllil-nadin-akhe, prisoner to Susa where he died.

=== Mittani and the Hittites ===

Mittani was a feudal kingdom established in Northern Mesopotamia (present-day Syria and Turkey) in the 14th century BC by fierce warriors believed to be of Aryan descent. This is one of the earliest instances when we hear of the Indo-European people who later founded the Persian kingdom. The connection of the Mittani with Indo-Aryan people was first proposed in 18  when inscriptions founded at Boghazkoy in Turkey spoke of a marriage alliance between the Mittani and the Hittites and invokes Vedic Gods like Indra, Varuna, Mitra and the Nasatyas to pour blessings upon the couple.The Aryan-origin theory of the Mittani is further strengthened by the records of the Mittani which mentions monarchs with Indo-Aryan names such as Kirta,Sutarna,Barattarna,Parshatatar,Artatama,Artashumara and Tushratta.

Mittani power began to decline after the 13th century BC and they gradually became vassals of the Assyrians.

Like the Mittani, the Hittites were speakers of an Indo-Aryan language who ruled over Central Anatolia. They rose to power in the 18th century BC and gradually expanded their dominions over the Levant and West Asia conquering Syria and clashing with the Mittani on the borders of Mesopotamia. In 1274BC, they clashed with Egyptian forces at Kadesh in Syria. However, after many days the battle came to a standstill with neither side able to vanquish the other. The rise of Assyria in Mesopotamia forced the Hittites to sign a treaty of peace with the Egyptians in 1258BC. However, their power did not survive for long and ended when Kaskas, Bryges and Luwian tribes burnt the Hittite capital Hattusa in 1180BC. A few centuries from the sack of Hattusa, the Hittites had completely disappeared.

=== Assyria and Neo-Babylonia ===

Assyria in Northern Mesopotamia seems to have come into prominence in the first half of the second millenium BC and to have conquered most of Mesopotamia on the defeat of the Hittites. The Assyrian Empire extended its authority over the Levant and parts of Iranian Kurdistan by the end of the millennium. However, frequent rebellions in Egypt taxed its resources and left Assyria badly weakened. When new peoples, the Persians and the Medes, migrated into modern Iran, they were able to attack and destroy the Assyrian civilization.The Assyrians ruled over Mesopotamia until 602BC, when Asur-uballit, the last ruler of Assyrians defeated by the Babylonians. The New Babylonians ruled much of Mesopotamia under kings like Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar
until 539BC when Cyrus conquered Babylon and put an end to Mesopotamian independence.

== The Zayandeh-Rud Civilization ==

[[Image:Sialk1.jpg|300px|left]]

In the 5th millennium BC, just as city states were emerging in neighboring Mesopotamia the Zayendeh Rud civilization was flourishing along the banks of the river of the same name in Central Iran. Isfahan, Bakthiari and the Yazd provinces of the modern-day Iran lay at the heart of the Zayendeh-Rud civilization. Isfahan is, in many ways, regarded as one of the oldest cities in the world. Archaeological research has also revealed the remains of an ancient buried city, which according to local lore, were believed to have been destroyed by war and famine.

The site of Sialk or Sialk Tappeh in the central Iranian province of Isfahan is a typical example of Zayendeh-Rud settlement. Sialk also has the world's oldest Ziggurat, built by the successors of the Zayendeh-Rud people, the Elamites in about 2900BC.

The Cheshma culture of south-eastern Tehran and the Hesar culture are some other elements of the Zayendeh-Rud civilization.

In December 2006, pottery and other decorated elements were found near the city of Bam in central Iran with unique motifs  that bore a striking resemblance to those found in the artifacts found in Sialk Tappeh. This site which covers an area of over 300 hectares is believed to be the largest pre-historic archaeological site in Iran.

In conclusion, teenage drivers are dangerous after dark and should be
prohibited from taking the wheel at night. Too many pieces of evidence demonstrate
that their general recklessness presents real peril after the sun has set.

all of us. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Of all the crazy laws in our country, the one that says an eighteen year old
can die for the American flag but not have a beer in a bar before doing so is
the dumbest. Sure, people can argue about how the drinking age being set at
twenty-one has some advantages but all in all, if I were thinking about serving
my country, I&amp;#8217;d find it ridiculous that Uncle Sam will permit me to shoot
a man before sharing a glass of wine with him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

completing one&amp;#8217;s thoughts - and not leaving ideas or essays incomplete -

patterns of logic that require 26 sentences to explain. This makes it very
tough for them to finish the essay and opens the door up for them to make
avoidable mistakes like constructing run-on sentences, engaging in convoluted
logic or simply not finishing the essay because they have run out of time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'&gt;However, slang can

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'&gt;For Example: If you
are telling a story to make a certain point about how crime is rampant in your
own neighborhood, you might make reference to the time when a guy crept up

&amp;#8220;Dude, gimme your wallet.&amp;#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span lang=EN-US

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'&gt;This would be an
acceptable use of slang.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:

&lt;p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'&gt;However, when
writing an essay about how rampant crime is in your neighborhood, you should
not write a sentence that reads, &amp;#8220;There are a multitude of dudes who only
want me to give &amp;#8216;em my wallet which I ain&amp;#8217;t gonna do.&amp;#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'&gt;This is a poor use
of slang. Know the difference!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:

      <text xml:space="preserve">In 1945, the leaders of the three allies (the USA, Britain and the USSR) met twice to decide the fate of the Axis countries after the War. The first meeting was at Yalta, near the Crimea, in the USSR, in February, between Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill. It is important to notice that this was before the War was over. Hence, the subject of the conference was to decide what would would happen once Germany had been defeated, so plans were only in brief. The following things were decided at Yalta:

==Redivision of Land in Europe==
The allies agreed that post-War Germany would be divided into four zones, and that each of the allies would be given a zone to occupy. The remaining zone, it was agreed, would be given to France. Also, a portion of eastern Germany would be given to Poland, although a portion of eastern Poland would be given to the USSR. This created the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot;, splitting Europe in two, and increasing tension between the superpowers.

==Free Elections==
Stalin also agreed at Yalta that he would allow &quot;free elections&quot; in Soviet-occupied eastern Europe. However, the Soviet Union and the other allies appear to have been working to different definitions of the word &quot;free&quot;. The Soviet constitution officially allowed &quot;free elections&quot;. However, in the Soviet Union, to quote George Orwell,:

{{cquote|All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.}}

This definition of &quot;free&quot; was not acceptable to the West, and was the beginning of Cold War tensions between the superpowers. However, they were able to agree that &quot;free&quot; elections would be allowed in Eastern Europe.

==Japan==
The allies also agreed that, three months after VE Day, the USSR would declare war on Japan. This caused problems, once the Truman Doctrine had been instituted, because the USA was not willing to allow further expansion of Communism into Japan, and hence had to use the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in order to prevent Soviet involvement in the final stages of the War.

The allies met again at [[The_Cold_War/Potsdam|Potsdam]], later that year.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Haskell solution}}

== Choosing how to compare ==

{{Exercises | Write &lt;code&gt;insensitive&lt;/code&gt;, such that &lt;code&gt;quickSort insensitive dictionary&lt;/code&gt; gives &lt;code&gt;[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, &quot;have&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;Linux&quot;, &quot;thing&quot;]&lt;/code&gt;}}

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import Data.Char (toUpper)
insensitive string1 string2 = compare (map toUpper string1) (map toUpper string2)
&lt;/source&gt;

Instead of comparing the two strings directly, we compare the all uppercase version. The order of the original two strings is then based on the order of the uppercase versions.

== Higher-Order Functions and Types ==

{{Exercises|1=
''(Challenging)'' The following exercise combines what you have learned about higher order functions, recursion and I/O.  We are going to recreate what is known in imperative languages as a ''for loop''. Implement a function 
&lt;pre&gt;for :: a -&gt; (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; (a -&gt; a) -&gt; (a -&gt; IO ()) -&gt; IO ()
for i p f job = -- ???&lt;/pre&gt;
An example of how this function would be used might be
&lt;pre&gt;for 1 (&lt;10) (+1) print&lt;/pre&gt;
which prints the numbers 1 to 9 on the screen.

The desired behaviour of &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; is: starting from an initial value &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; executes &lt;code&gt;job i&lt;/code&gt;.  It then uses &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; to modify this value and checks to see if the modified value &lt;code&gt;f i&lt;/code&gt; satisfies some condition &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;.  If it doesn't, it stops; otherwise, the for loop continues, using the modified &lt;code&gt;f i&lt;/code&gt; in place of &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;.
# Implement the for loop in Haskell.
# The paragraph just above gives an imperative description of the for loop. Describe your implementation in more functional terms.

Some more challenging exercises you could try
# Consider a task like &quot;print the list of numbers from 1 to 10&quot;. Given that &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; is a function, and we an to apply it to a list of numbers, using &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; sounds like the natural thing to do. But would it actually work?
# Implement a function &lt;code&gt;sequenceIO :: [IO a] -&gt; IO [a]&lt;/code&gt;.  Given a list of actions, this function runs each of the actions in order and returns all their results as a list.
# Implement a function &lt;code&gt;mapIO :: (a -&gt; IO b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; IO [b]&lt;/code&gt; which given a function of type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; IO b&lt;/code&gt; and a list of type &lt;code&gt;[a]&lt;/code&gt;, runs that action on each item in the list, and returns the results.

This exercise was inspired from a blog post by osfameron.  No peeking!
}}

Part 1:

1. A for loop in Haskell:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
for :: a -&gt; (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; (a -&gt; a) -&gt; (a -&gt; IO ()) -&gt; IO ()
for i p f job =
    if p i
    then do
      job i
      for (f i) p f job
    else return ()
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
*Main&gt; for 0 (&lt;3) (+1) (print)
0
1
2

&lt;/pre&gt;

2. &lt;code&gt;for i p f job&lt;/code&gt; is an &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; action built recursively. At the beginning of each recursive step, the boolean &lt;code&gt;p i&lt;/code&gt; is checked. The base case, reached when &lt;code&gt;p i&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;, the result is the do-nothing action, &lt;code&gt;return ()&lt;/code&gt;. In the recursive case, the result is an action consisting of &lt;code&gt;job i&lt;/code&gt; followed by &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; called with &lt;code&gt;f i&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and with the same function arguments as before.

Part 2:

1. The naïve solution, {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;map print [1..10]&lt;/code&gt;}}, would not work. The type of {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;map print [1..10]&lt;/code&gt;}} is &lt;code&gt;[IO String]&lt;/code&gt;, a list of actions. There is nothing wrong with that ''per se'', as actions are Haskell values like any others. However, a list of actions is not an action, and so it cannot e.g. be put in an &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; do-block and executed through &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;.

2. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
sequenceIO :: [IO a] -&gt; IO [a]
sequenceIO [] = return []
sequenceIO (a:as) = do
    v &lt;- a              -- runs the first action; binds the result to v.
    vs &lt;- sequenceIO as -- recursive call; binds the other results to vs.
    return (v : vs)     -- returns all results.
&lt;/source&gt;

3. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
mapIO :: (a -&gt; IO b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; IO [b]
mapIO f [] = return []
mapIO f (x:xs) = do
    y &lt;- f x
    ys &lt;- mapIO f xs
    return (y : ys)
&lt;/source&gt;

Alternatively, &lt;code&gt;mapIO&lt;/code&gt; can be implemented in terms of &lt;code&gt;sequenceIO&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
mapIO :: (a -&gt; IO b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; IO [b]
mapIO f xs = sequenceIO (map f xs)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Function manipulation ==

{{Exercises|1=
# Write implementations for &lt;code&gt;curry&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;uncurry&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;.
# Describe what the following functions do without testing them:
#* &lt;code&gt;uncurry const&lt;/code&gt;
#* &lt;code&gt;curry fst&lt;/code&gt;
#* &lt;code&gt;curry swap&lt;/code&gt;, where {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;swap :: (a, b) -&gt; (b, a)&lt;/code&gt;}} swaps the elements of a pair. (&lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; can be found in &lt;code&gt;Data.Tuple&lt;/code&gt;.)
# ''(Very hard)'' Use &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; to implement &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt;. Hint: begin by reviewing the sections about &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt; in [[Haskell/List processing#foldr|List processing]]. There are two solutions; one is relatively boring and the other is truly interesting. For the interesting one, think carefully about how you would go about composing all functions in a list.
}}

1.
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
myUncurry :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; (a, b) -&gt; c
myUncurry f (x, y) = f x y

myCurry :: ((a, b) -&gt; c) -&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; c
myCurry f x y = f (x, y)

myConst :: a -&gt; b -&gt; a
myConst x _ = x 
&lt;/source&gt;

A stylistic alternative is using lambdas to emphasise that a function is being returned. If you ever get confused while trying to implement a function-returning function, doing that might make it easier to see what the implementation should be.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
myUncurry :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; ((a, b) -&gt; c)
myUncurry f = \(x, y) -&gt; f x y

myCurry :: ((a, b) -&gt; c) -&gt; (a -&gt; b -&gt; c)
myCurry f = \x y -&gt; f (x, y)

myConst :: a -&gt; (b -&gt; a)
myConst x = \_ -&gt; x 
&lt;/source&gt;


2.
* &lt;code&gt;uncurry const&lt;/code&gt; passes the elements of a pair to &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;, in order. As &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; always returns its first argument, &lt;code&gt;uncurry const&lt;/code&gt; returns the first element of the pair; in other words, it is &lt;code&gt;fst&lt;/code&gt; in disguise.
* &lt;code&gt;curry fst&lt;/code&gt; converts &lt;code&gt;fst&lt;/code&gt;, which returns the first element of a pair, into a function of two arguments which returns the first one; therefore, &lt;code&gt;curry fst&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;.
*: Alternatively, &lt;code&gt;curry&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;uncurry&lt;/code&gt; are inverses (that is, they undo each other; &lt;code&gt;curry . uncurry&lt;/code&gt; amounts to &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;), and so if &lt;code&gt;uncurry const&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;fst&lt;/code&gt; it is evident that &lt;code&gt;curry fst&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;.
*: A third approach is noting that, given the types of &lt;code&gt;curry&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fst&lt;/code&gt; type of &lt;code&gt;curry fst&lt;/code&gt; is an {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;a -&gt; b -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;}} function. The only possible function with this type is &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;; therefore, &lt;code&gt;curry fst&lt;/code&gt; must be equivalent to it.
* &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt;, given a pair, produces a pair with swapped elements. &lt;code&gt;curry swap&lt;/code&gt;, therefore, takes two arguments and pair them in swapped order; it is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;flip (,)&lt;/code&gt;.

All of the above answers can be rigorously checked by expanding and substituting definitions. Here is how it is done in the first case; we suggest you try it with the other two.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- For the sake of mind-numbing explicitness, we will expand all
-- definitions as functions of a single argument, using nested lambdas.
uncurry const
(\f -&gt; \(x, y) -&gt; f x y) const -- Definition of uncurry.
\(x, y) -&gt; const x y           -- Applying to const.
\(x, y) -&gt; (\x -&gt; \_ -&gt; x) x y -- Definition of const.
\(x, y) -&gt; (\_ -&gt; x) y         -- Applying to x.
\(x, y) -&gt; x                   -- Applying to y.
&lt;/source&gt;


3. ''What follows is a meticulous step-by-step explanation. If you are here because you gave up the exercise, you might still enjoy skipping to the end and trying to understand what the implementation is doing before returning and seeing how it was built.''

There are two key insights needed to pull off this trick. The first one is remembering that a left fold

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foldl f acc xs
-- To make things easier to see, we will make xs = [a, b, c]
-- wherever we need a concrete example. 
foldl f acc [a, b, c]
&lt;/source&gt;

can be expanded as

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f (f (f acc a) b) c)
&lt;/source&gt;

and then realising that if we flip &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and swap its arguments everywhere

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
flip f c (flip f b (flip f a acc)))
&lt;/source&gt;

we get an expression that associates to the right, just like a right fold!

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foldr g acc [x, y, z]
-- can be expanded as
g x (g y (g z acc)))
-- Now make g = flip f; y = c; b = y and a = z.
&lt;/source&gt;

The only problem is that the list elements in our right-associative expression are in the wrong order. The obvious way of fixing that is reversing the input list. That leads us to the first solution:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
boringFoldl :: (b -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b
boringFoldl f acc = foldr (flip f) acc . reverse
&lt;/source&gt;

Reversing the list, however, is rather inelegant and takes time proportional to the length of the list. At this point, the second insight comes into play. By looking at the expression with the nested &lt;code&gt;flip f&lt;/code&gt; and squinting a little

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
flip f c (flip f b (flip f a acc)))
&lt;/source&gt;

we can see we are actually taking &lt;code&gt;acc&lt;/code&gt; and applying several functions in sequence to it. We can make that transparent by rewriting the expression using &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
flip f c . flip f b . flip f a $ acc
&lt;/source&gt;

If we switch the &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt; to prefix notation

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(.) (flip f c) ((.) (flip f b) (flip f a)) $ acc
&lt;/source&gt;

it becomes clear that the function at the right of &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; can be written as a fold with &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foldr (.) id [flip f c, flip f b, flip f a] $ acc
&lt;/source&gt;

Another way of thinking about this step is recovering the intuition that &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; takes a list and replaces &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt; with the binary operator and &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; with the initial accumulator. In our case, &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, the do-nothing dummy function, is used as the initial accumulator. Next, we factor out the repeated &lt;code&gt;flip f&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foldr (.) id (map (flip f) [c, b, a]) $ acc
&lt;/source&gt;

Here we meet the same problem: the list elements are not in the order we would like them to be. The reversal is consistent with the fact that functions composed with &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt; are applied from right to left. However, this time we can, instead of reversing the list, simply flip &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foldr (flip (.)) id (map (flip f) [a, b, c]) $ acc
&lt;/source&gt;

Merely flipping the fold operator is not enough to turn &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;foldl&lt;/code&gt; because in the general case the operator arguments have different types, and so flipping causes a mismatch. Folding a list with &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt;, however, can only work if the list elements are {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;}} functions, and {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;a -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt;}} functions can be composed in both directions.

By abstracting from the concrete example we get the second solution:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
coolFoldl :: (b -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b
coolFoldl f acc xs = foldr (flip (.)) id (map (flip f) xs) acc
&lt;/source&gt;

If you find this final expression hard to grasp, making it more pointful by removing the &lt;code&gt;flip&lt;/code&gt;s may help:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
coolFoldl :: (b -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b
coolFoldl f acc xs = foldr (\g h -&gt; h . g) id (map step xs) acc
    where
    step x = \acc -&gt; f acc x
&lt;/source&gt;

Alternatively, we could make it even more pointfree, though that would be rather excessive.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
coolFoldl :: (b -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b
coolFoldl f acc = ($ acc) . foldr (flip (.)) id . map (flip f)
&lt;/source&gt;

Better yet, can someone brush up that last bit?  It's great to know something that can't be both actually funny and not based around humor, I mean here I was thinking you could do that but apparently I'm wrong.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Property of Elementary Equivalence==
FMT is about discrimination of structures.  So the basic question is &quot;Can I discriminate a structure from all different structures?&quot;, where different means not equal up to isomorphy.  This can be done for finite structures (but not for infinite ones). E.g. ...

==Properties for a finite Number of Structures==
So being of a certain structure can be seen as an elementary property, that discriminates a class of isomorphic structures from all others. Now we can think of properties that discriminate 2 different (nonisomorphic) structures from the rest.  They can also be descriminated by simply connecting the properties, like e.g. ...

This can be extended to properties for a finite number of structures, like e.g. ...

==Properties for an infinite Number of Structures==
Also properties that hold for an infinite number of structures can be thought of.  But these are not  discriminatable in the above way. E.g. ...

There are Logics that allow this sort of infinite disjunction, like ...

So, are there other ways to discriminate these structure in FO?  Sometimes, like in the case of ...

So we need a decision tool (method) that decides if structures with a certain property can be discriminated or not, i.e. responds either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; for all possible properties, i.e. is sound and complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Schrödinger's Equation can be used to find the electron distributions in a range of situations. The easiest to solve, theoretically, is the potential well. This is a region of space with a lower potential than neigbouring regions. The simplest case is where the well is infinitely deep, so electrons cannot ever escape. This is the '''Infinite Potential Well''':
*[[/1D Infinite Wells/]]
*[[/2D Infinite Wells/]]
*[[/3D Infinite Wells/]]

If you add more electrons to the box, the states are filled according to the Aufbau Principle:

*[[../The Aufbau Principle/]]

However, infinte wells don't exist and are just a convenient approximation. In real life, we deal with '''Finite Wells''':

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The 1D Infinite Well==

Often, it is convenient to consider an electron &quot;trapped&quot; in a closed space, for example in a pice of semiconductor with a large bandgap between it and its surroundings. This kind of electron trap is called a '''potential well''. The theoretically most striaghtforward case is the infinite potential well in one dimension, where an electron is confined completely and can never escape, as to do so would require an infinte amount of energy.

We will later expand this to more dimensions and the more realistic finite potential well, where the electron can escape.

[[Image:Infinite Potential Well.svg|right]]
For now, consider an electron trapped in an infintie potenital well, of width ''L'' (right). The potential of this systems is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;V\left( x \right) = \begin{cases}
                              \infty ,\quad x &lt; 0 \\
                              0, \quad \,\,\, 0 \le x \le L \\
                              \infty , \quad x &gt; L 
                            \end{cases}
  &lt;/math&gt;

The probability of finding an electron outside this region is zero. As the wavefunction of the electron in this well must be continuous according to the [[#Conditions on the Wavefunction|condtions on the wavefuction]], we are seeking a solution to ''&amp;psi;(x)'' that is zero at ''x=0'' and ''x=L''. if this were not true, we would have a discontinuity here.

==Solving for the Wavefunction==

We need to solve Schrödingers Equation to find ''&amp;psi;(x)'':

&lt;math&gt; - {\hbar^2  \over {2m}}{{d^2 \psi \left( x \right)} \over {dx^2 }} + V\left( x \right)\psi \left( x \right) = E\psi \left( x \right), \quad \quad 0 \le x \le L&lt;/math&gt;.

Since ''V(x)'' is zero on this inteval, we can write:

::&lt;math&gt; - {\hbar^2  \over {2m}}{{d^2 \psi \left( x \right)} \over {dx^2 }}= E\psi \left( x \right) \quad \quad 0 \le x \le L&lt;/math&gt;.

Rearranging,

::&lt;math&gt;{{d^2 \psi \left( x \right)} \over {dx^2 }} =  - {{2mE} \over \hbar^2 }\psi \left( x \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Recall that the energy is given by

::{|
|&lt;math&gt;E\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; = T\left( x \right) + V\left( x \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = {{\hbar ^2 k^2 } \over {2m}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Substituting for ''E'' in our differential equation gives:

::&lt;math&gt;{{d^2 \psi \left( x \right)} \over {dx^2 }} =  - k^2 \psi \left( x \right)&lt;/math&gt;

This is now a second-order differential equation with a standard form. The general solution is given by:
{{eqn|General Solution}}
::&lt;math&gt;\psi \left( x \right) = A \sin{kx} + B \cos{kx}&lt;/math&gt;

==Applying Boundary Conditions==

Applying the first boundary condition &lt;math&gt;\left( \psi \left( 0 \right) =0 \right)&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi \left( 0 \right) = A\sin \left( 0 \right) + B\cos \left( 0 \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, ''B''=0.

Applying the second boundary condition &lt;math&gt;\left( \psi \left( L \right) =0 \right)&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi \left( L \right) = A\sin \left( k L \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, ''kL'' must be a multiple of &amp;pi;:

::&lt;math&gt;kL=n \pi \quad n=\{ 0,1,2,\ldots \} &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;k=\frac{n \pi}{L} \quad n=\{ 0,1,2,\ldots \} &lt;/math&gt;

We call ''A'' the '''normalisation coefficient''', ''&amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''. This exists to ensure the probability of finding an electron in all of space is 1. Also, since when ''n=0'' the whole equation goes to zero, the proability of an electron existing is zero, and thus, the solutions to the Schrödinger Equation for a particle in a 1D box start at ''n=1'':

::&lt;math&gt;\psi _{n_x } \left( x \right) = \psi _0 \sin \left( {{{n_x \pi } \over L} }x \right), \quad n_x  = \left\{ {1,2,3, \ldots } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

Becasue we a working in the ''x''-direction, we have called our indexing number ''n&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''. This is called the '''wavenumber'''. The energies associated with the above solutions are given by:

::{|
|&lt;math&gt;E_{n_x }&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; = {{\hbar ^2 k^2 } \over {2m}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= {{\hbar ^2 n_x^2 \pi ^2 } \over {2mL^2 }}, \quad n_x  = \left\{ {1,2,3, \ldots } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

There are two thing to note here. 
*A wavefunction solving the Schrödinger Equation exists only for integer wavenumbers, ''n''.
*Each wavefunction (eigenfunction) has a specific energy (eigenvalue) associated with it. This is proportional to the square of the wavenumber and the energy of the wavefunction with ''n''=1, ''E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The diagram below shows the wavefunctions with wavenumbers 1, 2 and 3, plotted against the associated energy relative to ''E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'':

[[image:1D Wavefunctions with Energies.svg|centre]]

The probability densities can be found easily once the wavefunctions have been found - simply take the modulus (in the case of complex wavefunctions) and square. This results in proability densities as shown below:

[[image:1D Probability Density with Energies.svg|centre]]

==Normalisation Coefficient==

We can find the normalisation coefficient, ''&amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' using the knowlegde that the electron must be somewhere in the quantum well, and therefore the area under the proabability density function is one:

::&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_{ - \infty }^\infty  {\left| {\psi \left( x \right)} \right|^2 dx}  = \int\limits_0^L {\psi \left( x \right)^*\psi \left( x \right)}  dx  = 1&lt;/math&gt;

So, for our wavefunction, &lt;math&gt;\psi _{n_x } \left( x \right) = \psi _0 \sin \left( {{{n_x \pi } \over L} }x \right)&lt;/math&gt;,

::&lt;math&gt; \int\limits_0^L {\psi_0^2 \sin^2 \left(\frac{n_x \pi}{L}x \right) dx} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; \psi_0^2 \int\limits_0^L {\frac{1}{2} \left(1-\cos \left(\frac{2 n_x \pi}{L} \right)x \right) dx}  = 1&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_0^2 \left[ \int\limits_0^L {\frac{1}{2} dx} - \frac{1}{2}\int\limits_0^L {\cos \left(\frac{ 2 n_x \pi}{L} x \right) dx} \right] = 1&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_0^2 \left[\frac{L}{2} - \frac{L}{4 n_x \pi}\left[\sin \left(\frac{ 2 n_x \pi}{L} x\right) \right]_0^L \right]= 1&lt;/math&gt;

Because the area under the sine curve over a whole number of periods in zero, we have

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_0^2 \frac{L}{2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}&lt;/math&gt;

It turns out that this is independent of the wavenumber, so our normalised wavefunction for an electron in a 1-D infinite potential well is zero outside the well and given by the equation:
{{eqn|Wavefunction of Particle 1D Infinite Potential Well}}
:{|style=&quot; border: solid 2px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; 
|align=&quot;left&quot;|&lt;math&gt;\psi _{n_x } \left( x \right) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin \left( {{{n_x \pi } \over L}} x \right), \quad n_x  = \left\{ {1,2,3, \ldots } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Inside it, the associated energies are given by:
{{eqn|Associated Energies of Wavefunctions}}
:{|style=&quot; border: solid 2px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; 
|align=&quot;left&quot;|&lt;math&gt;E_{n_x} = {{\hbar ^2 \pi ^2 } \over {2mL^2 }}n_x^2, \quad n_x  = \left\{ {1,2,3, \ldots } \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

__NOTOC__
'''Æbleskiver''' (Danish meaning ''apple slices'' in English (singular: ''æbleskive'')) are traditional [[cookbook:Cuisine of Denmark|Danish]] [[cookbook:cake|cake]]s, somewhat similar in texture to [[cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American]] [[cookbook:Pancake|pancakes]]. Æbleskiver are cooked in a special æbleskive pan, a [[cookbook:Pots and Pans#Cast Iron|cast-iron pan]] with several hemispherical indentations in the bottom of the pan.

The English language spelling is usually '''ebleskiver''' or '''aebleskiver'''.

There are many recipes for æbleskiver. The following is offered as an example.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 [[cookbook:Egg White|egg white]]s 
* 2 cups (480 mL) all-purpose [[cookbook:flour|flour]] 
* 2 teaspoons (10 mL)[[cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]] 
* 1 tablespoon (15 mL) [[cookbook:white sugar|white sugar]]
* ½ teaspoon (5 mL) [[cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]] 
* ½ teaspoon (5 mL)[[cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 4 tablespoons (60 mL) [[cookbook:butter|butter]], melted 
* 2 cups (480 mL)[[cookbook:buttermilk|buttermilk]]
* 1 cup (240 mL) [[cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]], for [[cookbook:frying|frying]]

== Procedure ==
#Beat the whites until stiff.
#Mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, sugar, melted butter and buttermilk at one time and beat until smooth. Gently fold in the egg whites last. 
#Put about 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of vegetable oil in the bottom of each æbleskiver pan cup and heat until hot. Pour in about 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of the batter into each cup. 
#As soon as they get bubbly around the edge, turn them quickly. Alternatively, you can turn them halfway first, so that the baked crusts protruding from the pan will look like the [[w:Sydney Opera House|Sydney Opera House]]. And after a while you turn them the remaining 90°. This will give them a perfect ball-shape. (Danish cooks use a long knitting needle, but a fork will work). Continue cooking, turning the ball to keep it from burning.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*An æbleskiver pan is '''required''' to cook these properly.
*They were traditionally cooked with bits of [[cookbook:apple|apple]] (''æble'') or [[cookbook:applesauce|applesauce]] inside but these ingredients are not normally included in modern Danish forms of the dish. 
*Æbleskiver are not sweet themselves but are traditionally sprinkled with [[cookbook:Powdered Sugar|powdered sugar]], accompanied with [[cookbook:raspberry|raspberry]] or sometimes [[cookbook:strawberry|strawberry]] [[cookbook:jam|jam]], and served with ''gløgg''.

The set of '''Quaternions''' is an algebraic structure first studied by the Irish mathematician [[w:en:William Rowan Hamilton|William Rowan Hamilton]], in the hopes of constructing a generalization for complex numbers. When first discovered, quaternions generated a lot of excitement among mathematicians and physicists alike, for it was hoped that quaternions would provide a &quot;unified theory&quot; of mechanics and electromagnetism. Although these hopes proved to be unfounded, quaternions are still considered interesting as well as useful mathematical entities. 

==Definition==
A '''Quaternion''' is an ordered 4-tuple &lt;math&gt;q=(a,b,c,d)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. A quaternion is often denoted as &lt;math&gt;q=a+bi+cj+dk&lt;/math&gt; (Observe the analogy with complex numbers). The set of all quaternions is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt;. 

It is straightforward to define component-wise addition and scalar multiplication on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt;, making it a real vector space. 

The rule for multiplication was a product of Hamilton's ingenuity. He discovered what are known as the '''Bridge-stone Equations''':&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1&lt;/math&gt;

From the above equations alone, it is possible to derive rules for the pairwise multiplication of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; ij=k,  jk=i,  ki=j &lt;/math&gt; (positive cyclic permutations)

&lt;math&gt;ji=-k,  kj=-i,  ik=-j&lt;/math&gt; (negative cyclic permutations).

Using these, it is easy to define a general rule for multiplication of quaternions. Because quaternion multiplication is not commutative, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt; is not a field. However, every nonzero quaternion has a multiplicative inverse (see below), so the quaternions are an example of a non-commutative division ring. It is important to note that the non-commutative nature of quaternion multiplication makes it impossible to define the quotient &lt;math&gt;p/q&lt;/math&gt; of two quaternions &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; unambiguously, as the quantities &lt;math&gt;pq^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q^{-1}p&lt;/math&gt; are generally different.

Like the more familiar complex numbers, the quaternions have a conjugation, often denoted by a superscript star: &lt;math&gt;q^*&lt;/math&gt;. The conjugate of the quaternion &lt;math&gt;q=a+bi+cj+dk&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;q^*=a-bi-cj-dk&lt;/math&gt;. As is the case for the complex numbers, the product &lt;math&gt;qq^*&lt;/math&gt; is always a positive real number equal to the sum of the squares of the quaternion's components. Using this fact, it is fairly easy to show that the multiplicative inverse of a general quaternion &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is given by
 
&lt;math&gt;q^{-1}=\frac{q^*}{qq^*}&lt;/math&gt;

where division is defined since &lt;math&gt;qq^*&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar. Note that, unlike in the complex case, the conjugate &lt;math&gt;q^*&lt;/math&gt; of a quaternion &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a polynomial in &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;q^*=-\frac{1}{2}(q+iqi+jqj+kqk)&lt;/math&gt;.

The quaternions are isomorphic to the Clifford algebra ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') and the even subalgebra of ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''').

==Pauli Spin Matrices==
Quaternions are closely related to the Pauli spin matrices of Quantum Mechanics. The Pauli matrices are often denoted as&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sigma_1=\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\sigma_2=\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; -i \\ i &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\sigma_3=\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

(Where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the well known quantity &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; of complex numbers)

The 2×2 identity matrix is sometimes taken as &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt;. It can be shown that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, the real linear span of the matrices &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i\sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i\sigma_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i\sigma_3&lt;/math&gt;, is isomorphic to the set of all quaternions, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt;. For example, take the matrix product below:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}i &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -i\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 1 \\ -1 &amp; 0\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; i \\ i &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Or, equivalently:

&lt;math&gt;i\sigma_3 i\sigma_2 = i\sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;

All three of these matrices square to the negative of the identity matrix. If we take &lt;math&gt; 1=\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i=i\sigma_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j=i\sigma_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k=i\sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;, it is easy to see that the span of the these four matrices is &quot;the same as&quot; (that is, isomorphic to) the set of quaternions &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Exercise==
#Using the Bridge-stone equations, explicitly state the rule of multiplication for general quaternions, that is, given &lt;math&gt;q_1=a_1+b_1i+c_1j+d_1k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_2=a_2+b_2i+c_2j+d_2k&lt;/math&gt;, give the components of their product &lt;math&gt;q=q_1q_2&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What Are Real Numbers? ==
'''Real numbers''' are, most likely, all the numbers you can think of! They consist of zero (0), the positive and negative integers (-3, -1, 2, 4), and all the fractional and decimal values in between (0.4, 3.1415927, 1/2). Real numbers are divided into rational and irrational numbers. '''Rational numbers''' are numbers that can be expressed as a ratio (that is, a division) of two integers (2/3, 0.6, 3, -4.7, 0.11111...). If a number has a terminating decimal, or a decimal that ends (3.6, 5.263) or repeats (1.33333....), it is rational. '''Irrational numbers''' have decimal parts that do not terminate or repeat (2.71828..., 3.14159...). There are several other different &quot;sets&quot; of rational numbers.

'''Natural numbers''', also known as &quot;counting numbers&quot;, are the first numbers you learn. The natural numbers include all the positive whole numbers (1, 24, 6, 2, 357). Note that zero is not included.
'''Whole numbers''' are the natural numbers, plus zero.
'''Integers''' are all positive and negative numbers without a decimal part (3, -1, 15, -42).

== Properties Of Real Numbers ==
We begin this section with a review of the fundamental properties of arithmetic.  It may seem unusual to give so much emphasis to the few properties listed below, but there is a good reason.  '''Roughly speaking, all of algebra follows from the 7 properties listed in the table below'''.  In the table below, ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' can be any number unless stated otherwise.  So let's take a look:

'''Commutative'''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt; a + b = b + a &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  This doesn't work: &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt; a - b \ne b - a &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
  This does: &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt; a + (-b) = (-b) + a &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  
  &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt; a * b = b * a &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  This doesn't work: &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt; a/b \ne b/a &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
  This does: &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt; a * 1/b = 1/b * a &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

'''Associative'''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt; (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  This doesn't work: &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt; (a - b) - c \ne a - (b - c) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  This does: &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt; (a - b) - c = a - (b + c) = a + (- b - c) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt; (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  This doesn't work: &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt; (a/b)/c \ne a/(b/c)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
  This does: &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;(a/b)/c = a*1/b*1/c = a /(b*c) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

'''Identity'''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;a + 0 = a&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;a - 0 = a&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt; a*1= a&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt; a/1= a&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

'''Inverse'''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

   &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;a + - a = 0 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;a - a = 0 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;a * (1/a) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; &amp;nbsp; as long as a &amp;ne; 0.&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;a / a = 1 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; &amp;nbsp; as long as a &amp;ne; 0.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Distributive'''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 
   &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;a*(b + c) = a*b + a*c&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;a*(b - c) = a*b - a*c&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;(a + b)/c = a/c + b/c&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 
   But wait: &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;  a/(b + c) \ne a/b + a/c &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

But what does all this mean?
The '''commutative property''' is that you can exchange two numbers and still get the same answer.
The '''associative property''' is that you can change the grouping (i.e., change the position of the parenthesis) and still get the same answer.
The '''identity property''' is that there is a certain number that when operated with a number doesn't change it.
The '''inverse property''' is something that results to the identity number.
The '''distributive property''' means that you can distribute the operation.
Out of all of those properties, the distributive property is the one you'll probably use the most, because it is the only one that mentions both addition and multiplication at the same time. 
To give an example:  these properties even imply fundamental things such as: &quot;multiplication is repeated addition&quot;.  This book is not going to prove many things, but it would be useful for us to take a look at how this works. 

We apply the distributive property for a = 7, b = 1 and c = 1.

  {{Algebra/mult|7|1}} + {{Algebra/mult|7|1}} = 7 + 7

Though it may seem obvious, this is ''identity'' property for multiplication listed above. 
Now let's try to do the same thing with {{nowrap|{{Algebra/mult|7|3}}}}.  

  {{Algebra/mult|7|3}} = {{Algebra/mult|7|(1 + 1 + 1)}} 

Just like before, this is just the fact that 3 = 1 + 1 + 1 together with substitution.

  {{Algebra/mult|7|(1 + 1 + 1)}} = {{Algebra/mult|7|1}} + {{Algebra/mult|7|1}} + {{Algebra/mult|7|1}}

Once again, we apply the distributive property. Note that we can apply it to expressions with more than two numbers being added in parentheses. The proof is below.
While {{nowrap|1= 7 &amp;middot; (1 + 1 + 1) = 7 &amp;middot; 1 + 7 &amp;middot; 1 + 7 &amp;middot; 1}} is not covered by the distributive property alone, this problem is solved by grouping the last two 1s with parentheses.  Rather than writing this as {{nowrap|1= 7 &amp;middot; (1 + 1 + 1)}}, we could write it as {{nowrap|1= 7 &amp;middot; (1 + (1 + 1))}}, then used the distributive property with ''a'' = 7, ''b'' = 1 and ''c'' = (1 + 1). Then:
{{nowrap|1= 7 &amp;middot; (1 + (1 + 1)) = 7 &amp;middot; 1 + 7 &amp;middot; (1 + 1)}}.  Now we apply the distributive property just to the second (taking ''a'' = 7, ''b'' = 1, and ''c'' = ''1''.  Then (looking just at the second term) we have {{nowrap|1= 7 &amp;middot; (1 + 1) = 7 &amp;middot; 1 + 7 &amp;middot; 1}}.  Finally we can substitute this expression for the second term back into the equation to get: {{nowrap|1= 7 &amp;middot; (1 + 1 + 1) = 7 &amp;middot; 1 + 7 &amp;middot; 1 + 7 &amp;middot; 1}}.  

This looks like a lot of mindless parenthesis juggling, but the point is that the distributive property applies to arbitrarily long sums and products.  It is also true that 
:{{nowrap|1= {{Algebra/mult|''a''|(''b'' + ''c'' + ''d'' + ''e'')}} = {{Algebra/mult|''a''|''b''}} + {{Algebra/mult|''a''|''c''}} + {{Algebra/mult|''a''|''d''}} + {{Algebra/mult|''a''|''e''}}}}
Or we could make it even longer!  We could have as many terms in the sum as we like; as long as &quot;{{Algebra/mult|a|}}&quot; appears in front of each term on the right hand side we will have a true statement.  We will use this fact without justification (that is, without proof).
Let's remind ourselves what these properties tell us about arithmetic.  Commutativity and Associativity together imply that it doesn't matter what order we add things up in. 
Let's see why.  Associativity says that {{nowrap|1= ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}}. This should be thought of as a statement about the sum ''a'' + ''b'' + ''c''.  Why? Because usually addition is just defined between two things, so someone writes down something like {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b'' + ''c''}} some people may first add ''b'' and ''c'' first then add in ''a'', and other people might add ''a'' and ''b'' first and then add in ''c''. This property says (using a formula) that it doesn't matter which way you do it.
What about those people who add ''a'' and ''c'' together first?  Well, that is where commutativity comes in.  It tells us that we don't have add things up in exactly the order people write things down.  You can switch things around and still get the same answer.
Let's do one more example of using these properties to &quot;juggle parentheses&quot; to see that commutativity says you really can add ''a'' and ''c'' first and get the same answer.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|''b'' + ''c'' = ''c'' + ''b''
|This is the commutativity of addition applied to ''b'' + ''c''
|-
|''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = ''a'' + (''c'' + ''b'')
| This follows from substitution
|-
| ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' + ''c'') + ''b''
|This is just using associativity on the right side of the line above.
|}

Commutativity and associativity tell you that it doesn't matter in which order you add up {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b'' + ''c''}}. You will get the same answer regardless of order. The rule holds even if there are more than three terms: There may be 4, 12, or several thousand.  These properties would still tell us that it doesn't matter how we add things up.

The same properties for multiplication tell us it doesn't matter in what order we multiply things together.  We are free to change the order to anything that we find easier.  Does it ever really make things easier? Sure! For example if you were asked to calculate {{Algebra/mult|{{Algebra/mult|4|3}}|{{Algebra/mult|5|(1/4)}}}}, then I would personally think it would be easier to calculate {{Algebra/mult|{{Algebra/mult|4|(1/4)}}|{{Algebra/mult|3|5}}}}

The ''identity'' and ''inverse'' properties really capture what it means to say that &quot;addition and subtraction are opposites&quot; and &quot;multiplication and division are opposites, as long as it isn't zero that we multiply by.&quot; We shall leave it as an exercise to the interested reader to think about why this is.

You can often simplify expressions using the Distributive Property.  This is one of the reasons it is so important.  For example, consider the expression {{nowrap|2(''x'' &amp;minus; 7) + 14}}.  What happens if we use the distributive property on the first term in this expression?  Let's work it out. According to the Distributive Property
:{{nowrap|1= 2(''x'' &amp;minus; 7) = 2''x'' &amp;minus; {{Algebra/mult|2|7}} = 2''x'' &amp;minus; 14}}
Plugging this into the expression above we get {{nowrap|1= 2(''x'' &amp;minus; 7) + 14 = 2''x'' &amp;minus; 14 + 14 = 2''x''}}.  Clearly 2''x'' is a lot easier to evaluate than {{nowrap|2(''x'' &amp;minus; 7) + 14}}!

== Basic Laws In Algebra ==

There are several basic laws in algebra.  Understanding these will help you to manipulate and solve equations, and to understand algebraic relationships.

===  1. Commutative Law ===

In general, the order of the items can be changed without affecting the results.
 
For addition, &lt;math&gt;A + B = B + A&lt;/math&gt; indicates that changing the order of the items added does not affect the sum.
 
For multiplication, &lt;math&gt;X Y = Y X&lt;/math&gt; indicating that the changing of the order of the items multiplied does not affect the product.

Note that the commutative law does not apply to subtraction or division.

===  2. Associative Law === 

In general, the grouping of the items can be changed without affecting the results.  (Seems to be an extension of the commutative law).

For addition, &lt;math&gt;A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C&lt;/math&gt;  indicates that changing the grouping of the items added does not affect the sum.

For multiplication, &lt;math&gt;X ( Y  Z ) = ( X  Y ) Z&lt;/math&gt; indicates that changing the grouping of the items multiplied does not affect the product.

As with the commutative law, the associative law does not apply to subtraction or division.

===  3. Distributive Law === 

Indicates that common terms can be  factored, or that factors can be distributed.
'''(A + B) X = (A X) + (B X)'''   (The &quot;X&quot; terms on the right are combined into a factor on the left side; the factor &quot;X&quot; on the left is distributed on the right side).

Consider the substitution of  '''X = (Y + Z)''' into the above equation  yields
('''A + B) (Y + Z) = A (Y + Z) + B (Y + Z)'''.
Apply the distributive law to each term on the right yields '''A Y + A Z + B Y + B Z'''.
We can skip the intermediate step if we multiply the terms identified by “F O I L” in the following expression
'''(A + B) (Y + Z) ='''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Letter || Description || terms
|-
| F || First terms || '''A Y +'''
|-
|O || Outside terms || '''A Z +'''
|-
|I || Inside terms || '''B Y +'''
|-
|L || Last terms ||'''B Z'''
|}

=== 4. Law of Identity ===

For '''addition and subtraction''' the law of identity indicates that the addition '''and''' subtraction of a given term or quantity results in the zero, 0, the identity element for addition and subtraction.  Alternately, adding the identity element results in no change to the original value or quantity.

'''&lt;math&gt;A - A = 0&lt;/math&gt;'''

Adding A to both sides of the first equation we get '''(A - A) + A = 0 + A'''.  Re-arranging or substituting gives  '''0 + A = A'''

:Note the special case(s) where '''A = A + 0 = A + 0 + 0'''

For '''multiplication and division''' the law of identity indicates that the multiplication '''and''' division of a given term or quantity results in &quot;one,&quot; 1, the identity element for multiplication and division.  Alternately, multipling or dividing by the identity element results in no change to the original value or quantity.

&lt;math&gt; 1 = \frac{Y}{Y}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt; 1 = (\frac{Y}{1}) (\frac{1}{Y})&lt;/math&gt;

:Note that dividing 1 by a term or quantity gives the reciprocal of the term or quantity.  Multiplying by the reciprocal is the same as dividing by the term or quantity. In the above equation on the right '''(Y / 1), and (1 / Y)''' are reciprocals of each other
:Note the special case where &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1}{1}&lt;/math&gt;, Multiplying this equation by “1” gives  &lt;math&gt;1(1) = (1)( \frac{1}{1} )&lt;/math&gt;, and then dividing by one gives &lt;math&gt;\frac{1(1)}{1} = (1)(\frac{1}{1} ) = &lt;/math&gt;.
:Simplify this by substititing the first special case equation to get &lt;math&gt;1 = 1(1)&lt;/math&gt; , and &lt;math&gt;1 = 1(1)(1) &lt;/math&gt;,  '''. . .'''

By multiplying both sides of the first equation by '''“Y”''' we get  &lt;math&gt; (Y)(1) = (Y)(\frac{Y}{Y})&lt;/math&gt; , which simplifies and becomes ''' (Y) = (1) Y.'''

== Lesson Review ==

All numbers that we will be working with for the majority of Algebra are called Real Numbers. They consist of Rational and Irrational Numbers. Irrational Numbers are numbers that have infinite, non-repeating decimals, such as pi. Rational Numbers are all numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of integers, which include Natural Numbers, Whole Numbers, Integers, and Rational Numbers. For all Real Numbers, there are a few properties of addition and multiplication: Commutative, Associative, Identity, Inverse, and Distribution. The Distribution will come in handy for the rest of the course.

Challenge Questions:
#Yes, take two rational numbers &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{d}&lt;/math&gt; the product of those two numbers is &lt;math&gt;\frac{ac}{bd}&lt;/math&gt;, which is still rational (remember that a rational number is one that can be expressed as a ratio of two numbers). This is an example of the closure property for rational numbers.
#No, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is irrational, however, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2} = 2&lt;/math&gt; is an integer. 
#No, consider two numbers &lt;math&gt;1+\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1-\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; both of these numbers are irrational, however when you add them together, the irrational part &quot;cancels&quot; and you are left with a rational part. In other words, because you can always add a number and its negative to get 0 (which we consider to be rational), you can always get a rational number from an irrational number. 
#Yes, because if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; were irrational but &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; were equal to {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;a/b&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}} for some integers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; would be equal to the rational number {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;a^2/b^2&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}, contradicting the fact that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is irrational.
#Yes, the product of two rational numbers is rational (see the first challenge problem) similarly the sum of two rational numbers is also rational. If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is rational then &lt;math&gt;x+1&lt;/math&gt; is rational, then &lt;math&gt;x(x+1)&lt;/math&gt; must also be rational. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; must be irrational.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Brief History of Detecting Exoplanets==
Speculations about the existence of exoplanets have been ongoing since the time of Isaac Newton’s General Scholium (1713). Newton hinted that other stars had planets orbiting them just as our sun.
&lt;ref name = &quot;one&quot;&gt; Isaac Newton, The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, trans. Andrew Motte (London, 1729), pp. 387-93. &lt;/ref&gt; 
The first claims of a detection of an exoplanet were centered on 70 Ophiuchi. In 1855 Capt. W. S. Jacob claimed that the orbit of the binary system exhibited an anomaly. A third body, an exoplanet, was held responsible.
&lt;ref name = &quot;two&quot;&gt;Jacob, W. S. &quot;On certain Anomalies presented by the Binary Star 70 Ophiuchi.&quot; Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 15 (1855): 288-89. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1855MNRAS..15..228J&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1890’s, Thomas Jefferson Jackson See supported these claims based on orbital movement as well.
&lt;ref name = &quot;three&quot;&gt; Thomas Jefferson Jackson (1896). &quot;Researches on the Orbit of F.70 Ophiuchi, and on a Periodic Perturbation in the Motion of the System Arising from the Action of an Unseen Body&quot;. The Astronomical Journal 16: 17. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1896AJ.....16...17S&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1899, those claims were disproved by Forest Moulton who analyzed the triple system and demonstrated that such a system would be unstable under the orbital parameters put forth by Jackson.
&lt;ref name = &quot;four&quot;&gt;Sherrill, Thomas J. (1999). &quot;A Career of controversy: the anomaly OF T. J. J. See&quot; (PDF). Journal for the history of astronomy 30, http://www.shpltd.co.uk/jha.pdf. Retrieved on 27 August 2007. &lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1960’s Peter Van de Kamp claimed that Barnard's Star had an exoplanet.  He based this claim on an apparent wobble in the star’s motion.
&lt;ref name = &quot;six&quot;&gt;van de Kamp, Peter (August 1969). &quot;Alternate dynamical analysis of Barnard's star&quot;. The Astronomical Journal 74: 757–759. doi:10.1086/110852, http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1969AJ.....74..757V. Retrieved on 27 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  
Kamp spent 40 years studying the Barnard star.  Observations made by other telescopes were never able to replicate the date of the wobble.  It is believed that the wobble was an anomaly of equipment at Sproul Observatory.  There is still no conclusive evidences for or against a planet existing around Barnard’s Star.

The first detection to be later confirmed of an exoplanet was made in 1988 by Bruce Campbell, G.A.H. Walker and S. Yang. The star Gamma Cephei was tentatively proposed to have an exoplanet based on [[Astronomy/Extrasolar Planets#Detection Methods|radial velocity]] observations. It was given a tentative status because the observations were made at the very limit of the capability of the instruments at the time.
&lt;ref name = &quot;seven&quot;&gt;Campbell, B.; Walker, G. A. H.; Yang, S. (1988). &quot;A search for substellar companions to solar-type stars&quot;.

The claim was mistakenly retracted, for in 2002 Artie Hatzes and his collaborators were able to confirm the existence of the exoplanet.
&lt;ref name = &quot;eight&quot;&gt;Hatzes et al. (2003). &quot;A Planetary Companion to Gamma Cephei A&quot;. The Astrophysical Journal 599 (2): 1383 – 1394. doi:10.1086/379281, http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/379281&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Wolszczan and Frail proved there were two planets of 3.9 and 4.3 Earth masses orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12 at .46 and .36 AU respectively.
&lt;ref name = &quot;nine&quot;&gt;Wolszczan, A.; Frail, D. A. (1992). &quot;A planetary system around the millisecond pulsar PSR1257+12&quot;. Nature 355: 145 – 147. doi:10.1038/355145a0, http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v355/n6356/abs/355145a0.html&lt;/ref&gt;
A third planet was discovered later of .025 Earth masses orbiting at .19 AU. This discovery is considered to be the first definitive detection of an exoplanet, because the Cambell, Walker, and Yang discovery was not confirmed until 2003.  This was a rather strange discovery because it was revolving around a pulsar rather than a main sequence star like our sun. It is believed that the planets are the remains of a solar system after the star died.

The first discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a main sequence star, 51 Pegasi, was announced October 6, 1995 by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz.

When the distance and mass of the planet were determined they were found to be incompatible with theories of planetary formation at the time.

They used the [[Astronomy/Extrasolar Planets#Detection Methods|radial velocity]] method to detect the planet. This ushered in the modern era of exoplanet study. After their discovery numerous exoplanets have been detected as a result of improved telescopes with higher resolutions and more powerful computers.

As of August 19 2012, 777 exoplanets have been detected.

The rate of discovery has steadily increased due to improved technology and a greater interest in exoplanets, with 61 planets detected in 2007. Using the Spitzer Space Telescope, studies of the evolution of gas and dust around main sequence stars indicate that at least 20 percent, and possibly as many as 60 percent, of main sequence stars are candidates for forming rocky planets. The actual percentage is likely between these two extremes.

Most exoplanets detected have been massive Jupiter-like planets. Most likely this is due to the ease of detecting such in comparison to smaller terrestrial planets; this is known as a selection effect. Planets, labeled Super-Earths, have also been detected. They are about 5 to 10 Earth masses. One Earth mass would be the mass of the earth.

&lt;br&gt;

==Detection Methods==
There are six methods currently used to detect exoplanets: Astrometry, [[Astronomy/The Doppler Effect|Radial Velocity]], Pulsar timing, Transit method, Gravitational micro-lensing, Direct imaging. Three methods detect a dynamical perturbation of the star, or wobble of the star due to the planet’s gravitational force. Since the planet and the star revolve around a common center of mass the star will appear to wobble with the same period as the planet’s orbital period. From our point of view the wobble will be from side to side, towards and away, or some combination of the two.[[Image:Orbit3.gif|right|thumb|A top-down image showing how the star wobbles around a common center of mass with a planet.]]

The degree of a star’s wobble is determined by the mass of the star and the planet, and by the distance between them. The more massive a planet is in comparison to that of its star, the greater the wobble. The closer the planet’s orbit to the star the greater the degree of the wobble observed of the star. Any method that detects an exoplanet this way can give information about the planet’s mass, though a combination of methods is needed to find the true mass of a planet.

[[Image:Doppler shift caused by exoplanet.jpeg|left|thumb|Image of an observed [[w:Doppler Shift|Doppler Shift]] caused by a planet.]]
The three ways we detect this wobble are by [[Astronomy/The Doppler Effect|radial velocity]], astrometry, and pulsar timing. [[Astronomy/The Doppler Effect|Radial velocity]] measurements detect the blue and red shifts of a star as it moves toward and away from Earth, respectively. As the star moves toward Earth, the light shifts to blue. As the star moves away from Earth the light shifts to red. The [[Astronomy/The Doppler Effect|radial velocity]] can be deduced by studying the red and blue shifts in the spectroscopy of the star’s emission. Most exoplanets have been discovered by the [[Astronomy/The Doppler Effect|radial velocity]] method.
&lt;ref name = &quot;twentysix&quot;&gt;Henry, Gregory, Eric Ford, Chris McCarthy, Kevin Apps, Greg Laughlin, and Bernie Walp. California &amp; Carnegie Planet Search. Anglo-Australian. &lt;http://exoplanets.org/&gt;&lt;http://exoplanets.org/othermethframe.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The velocity of the star around the barycenter is much smaller than the planet’s velocity because the planet’s orbital distance from the center of mass is greater than the star’s. Current spectrometers can detect a velocity variation down to 1 m/s. 
&lt;ref name = &quot;twentytwo&quot;&gt;Wright, Jason T. &quot;Detecting Exoplanets with Precise Radial Velocities.&quot; &lt;/ref&gt;
The larger the velocity differences in the star, the easier it is to detect. Thus the [[Astronomy/The Doppler Effect|radial velocity]] method can more easily detect exoplanets that have a larger mass and are closer to their stars.
&lt;ref name = &quot;twentysix&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Astrometry Method is the oldest search method though it wasn’t the method used to discover the first exoplanet. The astrometry method looks for angular change in the position of a star. The more a star moves, the easier it is to detect. Since this method relies on the orbit around a center of mass it is dependent on the mass ratio of the planet and star.
&lt;ref name = &quot;twentysix&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, unlike the [[Astronomy/The Doppler Effect|radial velocity]], the angular change in position increases with greater distance between the star and the exoplanet. The further the planet is from the star, the further they are from their mutual center of mass. The greater a star’s distance from the center of mass, the greater the angle change between the star’s opposite ends of its orbit.
&lt;ref name = &quot;twentysix&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:White dwarf in AE Aquarii.jpg|left|thumb|An artists rendition of a White Dwarf orbiting another star courtesy of [[w:NASA|NASA]].]]In the Pulsar Timing Method, a pulsar emits radio waves in extremely regular time intervals as it rotates. Any anomalies in the time between radio waves are an indication that the pulsar is orbiting a center of mass. This method is very sensitive. Planets that are one-tenth Earth masses can be detected this way.&lt;ref name = &quot;twentysix&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Planetary transit.svg|right|thumb|Diagram of a Planetary Transit and the corresponding reduction in light received from the star as the planet blocks some of it.|290px ]]The Transit Method detects changes in the brightness of star as a planet moves across the star's face. The dimmer the star becomes, the larger the planet, thus the volume of a planet can be determined by this method. This method requires that the planet’s orbit passes directly between the star and earth, which is a rare alignment.&lt;ref name = &quot;twentysix&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;


The Gravitational Lensing Method measures an amplification of a star’s brightness. As light from a background star passes the planetary system, the light is bent towards a planet due to its[[Image:Gravitational micro rev.jpg|left|thumb|Using [[w:Gravitational Lensing|Gravitational Lensing]], the curvature of incoming light due to an object's gravity, to detect a planet orbiting a star.|280px]] gravity. The light is focused into a smaller area thus increasing its brightness. This method is capable of detecting low mass planets around dim stars at a great distance.&lt;ref name = &quot;twentyone&quot;&gt;Sackett, Dr. Penny D. &quot;Microlensing exoplanets.&quot; 5 Aug. 2008. Http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Microlensing_exoplanets.com&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The final method currently used to detect planets is to directly observe them. Usually a parent star's shine obscures a planet's emission. However, in certain cases the reflected light of a planet can be seen.  Such a method works best when the planet is more massive than Jupiter, less than a tenth the age of our solar system, more distant from its parent star than Jupiter and orbits a star less luminous than our sun. It is also possible to detect a planet’s light if we restrict ourselves to infrared radiation, which is the dominant emission wavelength of a planet. This is very difficult and few planets have been detected this way. &lt;ref name = &quot;fifteen&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Extrasolar Jovians==
Many gas giants have been discovered orbiting distant stars, many of larger than Jupiter. That is because big planets are massive enough to gravitationally affect the movement of their star sufficiently that the perturbation is detectable. Therefore the biggest extrasolar planets are the easiest and earliest to be found.

===The First Discovery===
The first extrasolar planet discovered was ''Gamma Cephei Ab'', a planet orbiting ''Gamma Cephei A'' with an orbital period of around 900 days at  a distance of around 1.7 - 2.5 [[w:Astronomical unit|AU]] from its parent. Its existence was suspected as early as in 1989, and evidence of it strengthened considerably in 2002 from observations at the McDonald Observatory. It is a Jovian-sized planet with a mass estimated to be above 1.59 times that of Jupiter's. The star it orbits is an orange sub-giant star part of the ''Gamma Cephei'' binary star system, with its companion ''Gamma Cephei B'' a red dwarf.

==Spectra of Hot Jupiters==
[[Image:SpectraFromExtraSolarPlanet.jpg‎ |right|thumb|An image representation of the method of determining the elemental composition of the atmosphere of extrasolar planets by the light reduction method.|400px]]
Astrophysicists have recently observed spectra from hot Jupiter sized planets in planetary systems many light years away. &lt;ref name = &quot;Sing&quot;&gt; Sing, D. 2008, Astrophysical Journal 686:658–666, 2008 October 10 &lt;/ref&gt; Since these planets are so distant, it’s not as simple as just looking at the planet and collecting data about the direct light from the planet. &lt;ref name = &quot;Thompson&quot;&gt; Thompson, T. 2007, NASA Press Release http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/news/spitzer-20070221-full.html &lt;/ref&gt; The planets are too distant for such techniques and they are too close to their parent stars (sometimes closer than Mercury is to our sun).  &lt;ref name = &quot;Thompson&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Instead astrophysicists collect data from the star and planet during different parts of the planets’ orbit and seperate the light from just the planet.  

First the spectrum from the planet and star is collected.  This is done when, as seen from earth, both planet and star are at their greatest separation. Then the spectrum of just the star is obtained.  This is done when the planet is either directly in front of the parent star (primary eclipse) or directly behind its parent star (secondary eclipse).  By subtracting the light of the star from the light of the star plus planet, the spectrum of the planet can be found.  &lt;ref name = &quot;Thompson&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PlanetDuringEclipse.jpg‎|left|thumb|Planet being eclipsed by the star it orbits from our perspective.|400px]]

===Spectroscopic Techniques: Primary and Secondary Eclipses===
The brightness of the parent stars of these planets is too high in comparison to the planets themselves in the optical range. Because of this, infrared light is detected to better differentiate the planet from the star.  &lt;ref name = &quot;Thompson&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The planet itself reflects very little optical light because the cloud layers prevent much of it from escaping.  The cloud layers emit much of the absorbed energy from its star as infrared light however, and so most it can be detected by the spectrometers of our telescopes (Spitzer and Hubble). Because the planet emits so much more radiation in the infrared range as compared to the reflected optical part of the spectrum, the differences in the two spectra are more exaggerated and the infrared part of the spectra is easier to use.

A secondary eclipse occurs when the hot Jupiter being observed passes behind its parent star, as viewed from Earth.  A primary eclipse, also known as a transit, happens when the planet passes in front of the star as viewed from Earth.  These eclipses are very rare because the planet, star and earth have to line up so that the planet completely eclipses. &lt;ref name = &quot;Thompson&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Only 54 of the 333 confirmed planets are transiting planets when viewed from Earth.  &lt;ref name = &quot;Schneider&quot;&gt; Schneider, J. 2008, Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia, http://exoplanets.eu &lt;/ref&gt;

===Spectroscopic results===
Spectra are used to identify molecules in the planetary atmospheres, and to determine relative abundances. If you know at what wavelengths an atom or molecule will emit or absorb light, you can examine the spectrum of light from a planet and determine if that molecule is present.  By looking at the full spectrum, scientists can decide which atoms or molecules specifically make up the planet and noting how much of that wavelength is emitted, the relative abundance of that atom or molecule can also be determined.  
[[Image:Blackbody.svg‎|center|thumb|Wikimedia Commons Image of Blackbody Radiation curves of stars by temperature.|400px]]
Many attempts are focusing on identifying water vapor on other planets. &lt;ref name = &quot;Thompson&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The two planets, HD 209458b and HD 189733b are the first two planets observed. &lt;ref name = &quot;Sing&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, they both seemed to be void of water vapor. &lt;ref name = &quot;Thompson&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the observational techniques weren’t sensitive enough to detect water vapor. By using new techniques, the evidence for these planets containing water vapor is growing. &lt;ref name = &quot;Barman&quot;&gt;Barman, T. 2007, ApJ, 661, L191&lt;/ref&gt; The first tests were done using a secondary eclipse of the star. &lt;ref name = &quot;Thompson&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the atmospheric composition of the planets, this technique could not see through the clouds on the planets.  The heat of the planet due to its closeness to the star also plays a part in the differences in results.  Because the planet is so close to the star, the side closest to the star will have less water than the side away from the star.  During a primary eclipse, the cooler and therefore wetter side will be facing towards earth. During a secondary eclipse, the dryer hotter side will be facing towards earth.  By using a primary eclipse&lt;ref name = &quot;Tinetti&gt;Tinetti, G. et al. 2007, Nature, 448, 7150, 169&lt;/ref&gt;, a team of scientists in France has found peaks in the light curve at 3.6 microns, 5.8 microns and 8 microns in such a pattern that they believe only water vapor could produce.  &lt;ref name = &quot;Sing&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The &quot;Aryan&quot; Migration Theory ==

During the second millennium BC, there were widespread migrations into Iran in waves from the north. These people, who had been commonly designated as Aryans, are believed to be the ancestors of the Iranians of today. Most historians feel that a majority of the Iranians of today are descended from nomadic pasture-dwellers from the north. However, recent discoveries and genetic studies have cast serious doubts on the Aryan theory. Even prominent historians like Sir Richard Frye have limited the use of the word &quot;Aryan&quot; while referring to Iran's ancient period. Recent genetic researches have revealed that the Aryans were actually a Middle-Eastern tribe closely related to the other peoples of the fertile crescent and were the descendants of the people who migrated to the Iranian plateau around 10,000 years ago, forming civilizations like the Elamite one. 

The acceptance of the concept of an Aryan race has been more widespread and greater in Iran than in other countries with an &quot;Aryan&quot; heritage as the United Kingdom, India or other modern Western European countries. This is because the very name &quot;Iran&quot; is derived from the name of a mythical land called &quot;Airyanem Vaego&quot; mentioned in the Avesta as one of the sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda.

== The Medes ==


The Medes were an ancient Indo-Aryan people. In the third millennium BC, they migrated from the North-west of Iran to the south and occupied the highlands of the Zagros chain. Starting with the 7th century BC, they organized a powerful Empire that fought against the Assyrians with considerable success and heralded the downfall of the Imperial Assyrian Empire of Mesapotamia. They exercised their power over much of modern-day Iran for a brief span of around 150 years. But their contributions, especially to Zoroastrian religion and philosophy and the modern Persian language have been immense.The Medes are closely related to the modern Kurds.

=== Origin ===

The origin of the Medes is shrouded in obscurity. They are believed by some to be the people of Madai mentioned in the Old Testament of the Bible. Modern scholars hold the universal opinion that they are the people of the Avesta.

It is widely presumed that their presence in Iran must date at least as far back as 1500BC. The Gathas, the sacred hymns of Zoroastrianism are believed to have been composed during this period. However, the first mention of Medes does not go beyond 835BC when they appear in the records of the Assyrian king Shalmenesser II. However, the Iranologist George Rawlinson gives evidence to the contrary. He says that the historian Kanosys of Carthion mentions the conquest of Babylon by Medes as far back as 2000BC. 

Rawlinson also says that the presence of Aryan influence amongst the &quot;seven Chaldean talons&quot; indicates Median presence in Northern Mesapotamia. He also says that the Medes were known to the Greeks and were referred to under the eponyms Medea and Andromeda. But most of these sources are uncertain and unreliable. We begin to get clear picture of the Medes only when they settle down in the country which is subsequently named after them and establish the Median Empire.

=== Kings ===

We first hear of Media during the time of Shalmanessar II of Assyria who speaks of having led an expedition to Media in the year 835BC. His son, Shamas-Vul boasts of having worsted the Medes in battle and ravaged their country. Following this invasion, the Medes appear to have become tributaries of Assyria and paid them regular tribute. However, a hundred years later, the Assyrians launched another invasion of Media and annexed the country of the Medes. Assyrian Emperors Sennacherib and Esar-haddon boast of having reduced Media into total submission.


Diyako or Deioces who united the seven Mede tribes is generally recognized as the first king of Media. However, both Herodotus and Ctesias claim that there were six Median &quot;monarchs&quot; prior to the rise of Deioces and gives their names as Arbaces, Maudaces, Sosarmus, Artycas, Arbianes and Artseus

==== Diyako (Deioces) 701 -665 BC ====

Deioces was the son of one Phraates and was a renowned judge in his part of Media. In 701BC, with dacoitry and lawlessness proving to be a headache, the seven tribes of Media came together and formed a kingdom. Deioces was the unanimous choice to be the king of  Media. He ruled the state with an iron hand until his death in 665 BC. His rise to power is described in detail in Herodotus' Histories. He is credited with having built a palace in the capital city,Ecbatana.

==== Kshatrita (Phraates) 665 - 633 BC ====

Fravartish or Phraates ''Old Pers. Kshatrita'' succeeded his father Deioces and  ruled Media from 665BC to 633BC.

Herodotus, in Line No.102 of his ''Histories''tells that Phraates was an extremely ambitious ruler and credits him with the subjugation of the Persians. In 634BC, with the assistance of his son, Cyaxares, Phraates launched an invasion of Assyria.  However, the invasion was an utter failure and in the battle fought at Adiabene, the Medes were worsted and their army, cut to pieces and Phraates, himself, killed.

==== Hvakshatra (Cyaxares) 633 - 585 BC ====

Following the death of his father Phraates in 633BC , Cyaxares retreated to Media and reorganized his army, till then under tribal chieftains, on a purely regimental basis. He then led a large army into Assyria and having defeated the Assyrians, pursued them to the gates of the Assyrian capital Nineveh. But Cyaxares did not launch a siege of Nineveh. Instead he was content to retreat with his soldiers back to Media. However, on his return to Media, the Median troops were confronted by bands of Scythians under their leader Madyes who inflicted a crushing defeat on them. Cyaxares surrendered and was compelled to pay a heavy tribute. 

The Scythian hegemony lasted eight years during which they earned a reputation for avarice through their repeated exactions. However, Scythians rarely interfered in the affairs of the inhabitants. Finally, in 625BC, eager to throw off the Scythian yoke, Cyaxares invited the Scythian chiefs to a traditional banquet and had them treacherously murdered. There were simultaneous eruptions all over Media resulting in a large scale destruction of the Scythians such that barely a semblance of their eight-year rule survived.

Having emerged victorious from his battle with the Scyths, Cyaxatres now desired to expand his dominions. He concluded a marriage alliance with Nabopolassar of Babylon by giving his daughter Amytis in marriage to Nabopolassar's son Nebuchadnezzar. He then launched a second invasion of Assyria in 612BC and put an end to the Assyrian Empire. '''This event is believed to have occurred during the reign of the third Achaemenid king Cyrus I and hence signifies a shift of power from the Assyrians to the Medes.''' 

Ctesias while describing the battle narrates how the combined forces of the Persians, the Arabs, the Medes and the Babylonians numbering four hundred thousand individuals were defeated in two pitched battles by  the Assyrians and how they rallied at the arrival of reinforcements from Bactira and surprising the Assyrian camp at night inflicted a crushing defeat upon them. Cyaxares proceeded to sack Nineveh and pulled it to the ground.

During the latter part of his reign, Cyaxares also invaded and conquered Armenia, Northern Mespotamia and Lydia. In 585BC, the Battle of Halys was fought between the Medians and the Lydians. The battle ended in a truce between the Medes and the Lydians. Cyaxares died soon after the battle.

==== Ishtovigu (Astyages) 585 - 549 BC ====

Astyages succeeded Cyaxares in 585BC. He is described by Herodotus as a vain incapable monarch given to luxury and comfort. Tradition says that he was remarkably handsome, cautious, and of an easy and generous temper. His reign is regarded as one of peace and few battles were fought. 

But Herodotus accuses him of excessive vanity. According to Greek accounts, he was always surrounded by eunuchs and women. Lavish feasts were held at the Great Palace of Ecbatana. The courtiers wore long flowing robes of many different colors, amongst which red and purple predominated, and adorned their necks with chains or collars of gold, and their wrists with bracelets of the same precious metal. Even the horses on which they rode had sometimes golden bits to their bridles. Astyages' chief pastime was hunting. The capital was surrounded by a park where the king hunted wild animals.

However, this period is especially remembered for the ascendancy of the Zoroastrian priestly class called the Magi.

All through this reign, there was one issue which bothered Astyages. His marriage with the principal queen, the Lydian princess Aryenis produced no male offspring nor did his affairs with any of his concubines. Legend says that he, however had a daughter Mandane who was married to Cambyses I of Persia. Their son Cyrus II would later wrest control of the state from his grandfather and become one of the greatest monarchs in history.  

Though historians barely assign any important wars to this period, it is widely believed that Astyages and not Cyaxares could have been the king who had actually fought the Lydians. At the fag end of his reign, the Armeians rose into revolt and were subdued by Astyages with an iron hand.

In 559BC, Astyages had to face the revolt of his own grandson, Cyrus of Persia. A battle was fought in which Cambyses I was killed. But Cyrus rallied the forces together and inflicted a crushing defeat on the Medes. The fleeing Median soldiers were pursued deep into their territory along with their king and commander Astyages. There were a couple of engagements between the Medes and the Persians. On conclusion of the first, the Medes had to flee as their camp was taken over and their royal insignia fell into the hands of the Persians. In the second engagement, Astyages was captured by the Persians. This brought an end to the war. Ecbatana surrendered and Media became a province of the fledgling Persian Empire.

== Zoroaster and the Birth of Zoroastrianism ==

Zoroaster also known as Zarathusra or Zardosht was born around this time. The religion which he founded, called Zoroastrianism originated  from an older polytheistic faith called Magism. This was the religion of the Medes and the Persians prior to the birth of Zoroastrianism and was the official state religion during the sovereignty of Media.

Media and Magism are closely related, so much so that the high priests of Magism, the Magi who give the religion its name were exclusively chosen from a Median tribe of the same name. The actual Persian name of the Magi seems to have been Magupat which gradually changed into Mobed with the passage of time. These Magi were the most supreme spiritual authority in the Empire. However, with the passage of time, the Dastur was elevated to a position  higher than that of the Magupat and the Magi themselves weren't picked ur from the Mede tribe.

The Iranians, prior to the birth of Zoroaster, worshipped natural forces. They were mostly Vedic divinites like Mithra, Varuna, Vayu, Agni, etc. One of the principal deities Yima Kshaeta (Jamshed in modern Persian) is believed to have originated from the Hindu Yama. Their pantheon also comprised other divinities like Anahita, Spenta Armaiti,Vohu-mano and Asha Vahishta. 

As Zoroastrianism expanded to every nook and corner of Persia, these divinities were incorporated into Zoroastrianism as angels and good spirits. For example, Vohu-mano, Asha Vahishta, Spenta Armaiti, Kshatra Vairya, Haurvatat and Ameretat became the six Amesha Spentas(arch-angels) of Zoroastrianism. Apart from the Amesha Spentas, there were the Fravashis (angels) and the Yazatas (Adorable ones) who were worshipped. 


=== Zoroaster: His Life and Philosophy ===

Zoroaster is believed to have born between 1400 and 1000BC in Northern Iran close to the Caspian coast. This is the land, which some people believe to be the paradise, Airyanem Vaego. His family name was ''Spitama'', a cognate of the Sanskreit ''Swetha'' meaning &quot;whiteness&quot;. His father was named Pourashaspa and his mother was Dugdhova. Little is known about his childhood except that he was an extremely pious boy. M.N.Dhalla in his History of Zoroastrianism (1938) describes Zoroaster's life in detail. However, this is an extremely biased account which gives credibility to legends and myths. Nevertheless, this is one among a few biographies of Zoroaster in existence.

Like the founder of each and every other religion, tales of Zoroaster's early life are often spiced and flavored with miracles. His birth had been prophesized prior to his arrival and was pre-destined to happen. Legend has it that Pourashaspa had longed for a child for a long, long time and prayed to Haoma to this effect. His prayers bore fruit with the birth of the Prophet. The ''Zarathusht-namah'' tells us that the angel ''Vohumanah'' entered the child's mind soon after his birth and the child laughed aloud immediately upon his birth which startled the people around. Tales also abound on how Porushaspa came under the influence of a wicked magician called Duasrobo and tried to kill the young child Zarathushtra on his insistence. However,  the young Zoroaster escaped miraculously each and every time in the end, killing Duasrobo himself. These tales bear a striking resemblance to the stories of Kamsa's attempts on the life of the young Krishna and those of Herod on the young Jesus.

M.N.Dhalla says that Zoroaster was disillusioned with his religion at a very early age. He questioned the need of sacrifices and elaborate rituals.  He stressed upon piety and goodness and was a sworn enemy of the Magian priests whom M.N.Dhalla calls Daivayasnians. However, the term Daivayasnians never existed and is purely an invention of the writer. Dhalla says that Zoroaster wanted to have a glimpse of the Great Lord Ahura Mazda but couldn't. However, he was suitably rewarded when his good thoughts, actions and conduct pleased Vohumanah who blessed him  with a vision of the Great Lord Ahura Mazda Himself. This is one of the most important events in the history of Zoroastrianism. Ahura Mazda dictated the holy scripture unto Zoroaster which he later revealed to the Iranian people. This has since been written down in the form of the various books of the Avesta. This was the Zoroastrian revelation.

After his conversation with Ahura Mazda, Zoroaster was sure that he was the chosen One of the Lord and went from place to place preaching his new religion. (His first convert was his cousin Maidhyoimangha). In some places, he provoked the open enmity of the Magian priests. Dhalla mentions two Magian priests Bendva and Grehma who were his sworn enemies. However, Zoroaster had the last laugh when he travelled to the Iranian court and converted the Shah of Iran to his new religion. Zoroastrianism was subsequently made the state religion and the people were ordered to convert to the new faith. It is believed that Zoroaster lived up to the age of seventy-seven.

Zoroaster stressed upon three main principles: Humata (good thoughts), Huktha (Good words) and Huvarashta (Good deed). This has been adopted by the present Islamic regime and has been incorporated as the motto of the Islamic Republic of Iran: pendar-i-nik, goftar-i-nik, kerdar-i-nik. At the focal point of the Zoroastrian pantheom lay Ahura Mazda or the Supreme Lord. Below him lay the six Amesha Spentas about whom we had already seen. These were the forces of goodness. However, later fire gained prominence and gradually displaced all others as the principle object of worship. Like Hindus, the early Zoroastrians considered cows to be holy and a recipe made of cow's urine was considered to be an instant purifier which could absolve a man of any kind of sin.

The forces of evil were led by Ahrimaan (the Old Persian Angra Mainyos) who was assisted by an army of demons (daevas). Chief amongst them was Indra who was the Avestan counterpart of Vedic God Indra. 

Zoroaster's marriage was arranged at a very early age . However, fables indicate, Zoroaster refused to marry the girl when she declined to remove her veil. Later, Zorosaster married three three times. His first wife bore him a son Isadvastra (whose son Ururvija was a prominent Zoroastrian missionary of later times) and three daughters -- Freni, Thriti and Pouruschita. His second wife was, allegedly, a widow and she bore him two sons -- Hvarechitra and Urvatnara.His third wife was Hvovi, daughter of Frashaoshtra, an important official in the court of Iran.

The name Zardosht is believed to have originated from either Zarat-ustra or Zarant-ustra.There are different theories with regard to the origin of his name:

Following *zarat-uštra- are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;moving camels&quot; or &quot;driving camels,&quot; and related to Avestan zarš- &quot;to drag&quot; (Bailey, 1953:40-42) 
&lt;li&gt;&quot;desiring camels&quot; or &quot;longing for camels&quot; and related to Vedic har- &quot;to like&quot; and perhaps (though ambiguous) also to Avestan zara-. (Mayrhofer, 42-43) 
&lt;/ul&gt;
Following *zarant-uštra- are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;with old/aging camels,&quot; related to Vedic járant- and similar to Ossetic zœrond. (Schlerath) 
&lt;li&gt;&quot;with yellow camels&quot; with a parallel to Younger Avestan zairi- (Werba, 1982:184ff) 
&lt;li&gt;&quot;with angry camels,&quot; from Avestan *zarant- &quot;angry, furious&quot; (Mayrhofer, 42-43) 
&lt;/ul&gt;

=== The Avesta ===

The Avesta is believed to have been compiled by the Prophet himself who dictated the 21 ''Nasks'' to his son-in-law Jamasp who inscribed the scripture in golden letters on cow hides. However, the cow hides have been lost to time. The Nasks themslves haven't survived in their entirety, except for one, the ''Vendidad'' which has been translated into English and most European languages.   

The Avesta, in its modern form, was written down between 78 and 300AD. Today, it is regarded as the most holy book of Zoroastrianism and like the holy books of other religions is believed to have been revealed by Ahura Mazda Himself.They comprise the Vendidad which is made of 22 Fargards, the Yasna comprising 72 sections, the Visperad comprising 23 Kord (or sections), the Yashts, the Khorda Avesta (Small Avesta) and the Gathas. The oldest of these books are the Gathas believed to have been composed around 1300BC. The language of the Gathas closely resembles Vedic Sanskrit and form one of the earliest extant works in the language called Old Avestan.

The Avesta, often prefixed by the word &quot;Zend&quot; and called Zend Avesta is derived from the Old Persian word &quot;A-vi-stak&quot;, the root word &quot;vi&quot; same as the root &quot;vi&quot; of the Vedas  meaning &quot;knowledge&quot;. The word &quot;Zend&quot; is derived from &quot;Zainti&quot;

[[Image:AvestanIran.jpg|thumb|right]]

The teachings of the Avesta appear highly-conservative even as per Zoroaster's standards. Ironically, for a man who spent a lifetime fighting superstition and rituals, the Avesta is filled with invocations to innumerable angels, black-magic, and prayers for the expiation of sins previously committed.These sins include introduction of any dead or impure matter into the holy fire, cremating or burying a corpse,etc. The Vendidad or Vi-daevodatem which means anti-demonaic law prescribes ways or purification of the impure. Pregnant women were regarded impure in Ancient Iran as they bore a grave in their wombs (in the form of a still-born child) and were to be confined to a corner of the house for nine-consecutive days and nights (known as Barashnum) far away from the holy fire. Similarly, a menstruating woman, corpse of a human being, etc. were all regarded as impure as they acted as carriers of the druj Nasu.Purity and chastity of an extreme kind were recommended.  People who did not adhere to these rules were either whipped in public or were asked to pay a huge sum as penalty. These were the laws as prescribed by the Avesta. However, it remains to be seen to which extent these laws were implemented. 

Apart from being a treasure in the eyes of a theologian, the Avestan books were also of immense historical interest. They were recited in a dialect of Old Persian which wasn't understood by the time they were written down (duri9ng the early Sassanian period). The Zand or the Zainti is believed to be a commentary in the Avesta which was essential for the religious text to be understood. The Avesta also gives a vivid description of the home of the Avestan people. Based on the Avesta, historians place the Avestan country in Northern Iran, roughly in the land known as Khorasan.

== The Achaemenid Dynasty ==

The Achaemenids were princes of the Persian race, who were an Indo-European people who migrated from the north of Iran. With the Median highlands being people by the tough and powerful Medes, the Persians were obliged to settle in a comparatively quiet and less occupied province of Pars in Southern Iran. During the 7th century BC, one Hakhamanisha rose to power and crowned himself the first King of Persia. His descendants overthrew the Medes and established the Achaemenid Dynasty. They ruled Persia for around 225 years until the fall of their last king Darius III in 331BC. During this period, they waged highly successful wars against Egypt, the Levant and the Greeks and expanded their kingdom to distant parts of the globe.


=== Origin ===


The first supposed mention of the Persians is in an inscription of the Assyrian king Shalmanesser II in    in which references are made to the Parsu of south-western Armenia. In the seventh century BC, a semi-mythical personality called Hakhamanish established a kingdom in Persia and ruled as a feudatory of the Assyrian monarch. He is known as Achaemenes to the Greek writers. He was succeeded by Teispes (Cispi), Cyrus I and Cambyses I. However, no evidence exists regarding the existence of these monarchs and stories of them are regarded as purely fictitious and concocted. In 612BC, however, the Mede Cyaxares inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Assyrians and occupied Nineveh. This resulted in a shift of balance of power as the Medes emerged as overlords of the Middle East and most of the known world. Cyrus I is believed to be the Persian monarch who immediately submitted to the emerging power. Median overlordship lasted until 559BC when Astyages was overthrown by Cyrus II or Cyrus the Great with whose reign Persia enters historical times. 


=== Cyrus II (Cyrus the Great) 549 - 529 BC ===

Cyrus ascended the throne of Persia in    His actual name in Old Persian happens to be Kurush. In his inscriptions, he extensively uses his royal title &quot;Vazraka&quot; which means &quot;the Great&quot;. In modern times, Cyrus referred to as &quot;Kurush-i-bozorg&quot; has become a symbol of Persian revival and is regarded as a hero by monarchists and right-wing nationalists alike. 

==== Early Life and Rise to Power ====

Cyrus II was born in 590 or 576 BC as per different versions, the son of the Persian Emperor Cambyses I and the daughter of Astyages of Media, Princess Mandane. There are a number of fantastical tales woven around the early life of Cyrus II including that he was brought up among a family of herdsmen. However, evidences of such an upbringing if at they are factual are yet to be found.

However, all the sources agree to the fact that Cyrus II was sent to the court of the Median ruler Astyages at Ecbatana at a very early age. The fact that Cyrus was a grandson of the Median ruler must be one possible reason. However, eyebrows are raised over the veracity of this claim. While Xenophon is the one who tells us that Cyrus was a grandson of Astyages, Nicolas and Ctesias say that Cyrus was in no way related to Astyages and his confinement at the court of Astyages was due to a strange personal attachment Astyages had towards him. However, Cyrus detested Ecbatana and the company of the vain old monarch who spent more of his time in merriment and conducting lavish feasts. He secretly desired to escape to his own country and lead a rebellion against Median yoke. But the royal priests and the Median astrologers had advised the monarch to keep Cyrus captive in Ecbatana for they said that if he ever allowed Cyrus to go back to Persia he would lose his kingdom forever. So, willing to preserve his kingdon, Astyages kept Cyrus under heavy-guard. But Cyrus managed to escape to Persia. The story of this escape is narrated in vivid detail by Rawlinson.



Desiring to leave for Persia, Cyrus petitioned Astyages requesting a leave of absence for five months reasoning that his father in Persia was ill. The first application was rejected. However, the second, made through the king's favorite eunuch was more successful. Astyages agreed and Cyrus set forth for Persia. But the next evening, as Astyages was enjoying a royal feast, one of the dancing-girls sang of &quot;a lion which had let a wild boar escape&quot;. Immediately, Astyages realized his folly and bade his soldiers set forth for the frontier and capture Cyrus either alive or dead. They caught up with Cyurus before he reached the border but the latter fooled the soldiers by inviting them for a drink and made good his escape taking advantage of their intoxication. By the time they caught up with Cyrus again, he had crossed into Persia and at the head of a Persian contingent now, he repulsed the soldiers who returned empty-handed to Ecbatana. Furious, Astyages led a huge army into Persia. The contingent consisted of a hundred chariots, fifty thousand horsemen, and three hundred thousand light-armed foot, who were drawn up in in front of a fortified town near the frontier. The battle lasted two days during which Cambyses I was killed and the Persians defeated. Astyages and his soldiers pursued the fleeing Persians to the hills where a second battle was fought. The Persians, taking advantage of their high-ground, charged furiously at the Medes and slew sixty thousand of them. Astyages immediately withdrew and later attacked the Persians at Pasargadae.A battle was fought which brought about an overwhelming victory to the Persians. All the insignia of Median royalty along with their treasures fell into the hands of the Persians. Cyrus followed Astyages into Media where a sixth battle was fought. The Medians were completely defeated and Astyages captured as a prisoner. Following the capture of Astyages, the whole of Media surrendered without the slightest resistance and Cyrus emerged as the absolute sovereign of the First Persian Empire.

The end of the Median dynasty came with the conquest of Ecbatana by Cyrus in the year 549BC. This was also the year when Cyrus conquered Media and made himself the master of Iran. Almost immediately after his victory over the Medes, Cyrus launched an invasion of Bactria (modern-day Afghanistan). The north-west was another region which had successfully resisted attempts at conquest. Cyrus led a large expedition to the north-western frontier and after occupying the outlying provinces with ease came to a face-to-face encounter with the kingdom of Lydia.

==== Conquest of Lydia ====

The Emperor of Lydia Croesus was a brother of the Mede Astyages and was greatly affected by his dethronement and the annexation of Media by Persia.He had a built a powerful Empire in Asia Minor conquering all the smaller states and this sudden rise was made possible mainly by the friendly relations he had with Media and non-interference by neighbouring countries.  During this period, Croesus earned perpetual fame for himself for the magnificent gold coins he minted. So, when Astyages was dethroned and his empire annexed by Cyrus he was worried about his own fate. This prompted him to ally with Greece and Babylonia. Cyrus, at once took an aggressive posture and invaded Asia Minor taking Diabekr, Malatiyah and Gurun. Croesus, at once declared war on Persia and crossing the Halys river attacked the city of Pteria in 547BC. This attack on Pteria has been immortalized by the famous legend involving the Oracle at Delphi. According to the legend, Croesus contacted the Oracle before his attack on Pteria. The Oracle suggested vaguely that, &quot;if King Croesus should cross the Halys River, a great empire would be destroyed.&quot; Croesus took these words with delight, instigating a war that would ironically and eventually end not the Persian Empire but terminate his own. 

The Lydian advance was  checked by Persian troops within the gates of Pteria and a terrible battle ensued.  Initially, the Lydians had the upper hand mainly due to the strength of their excellent cavalry.  But Cyrus  formed an advance brigade made of camelmen and charged at the Lydians forcing them to flee. However, soon, Cyrus gave up the charge allowing them to reach Lydia unmolested. When Croesus had reached his own palace and all fears of a Persian attack of Lydia had subsided, Cyrus saw his moment and gathered his army and attacked the Lydian capital taking Croesus by surprise. Croesus appealed to his allies for aid as the Lydian troops successfully defended the city for fourteen days. But on the fifteenth day, a Persian soldier discovered a secret passage into the city through its walls. The Persian soldiers capitalized on this discovery and enjacted a breach. Lydia was taken and absorbed into the Persian Empire. Croesus was captured and imprisoned but was later pardoned and ruled Lydia as a vassal of Persia.

Soon afterwards, Sardis became the scene of an insurrection. Pactyas, a Lydian, who had been entrusted with the duty of conveying the treasures of Croesus and his more wealthy subjects to Ecbatana, revolted against Tabalus, the Persian commandant of the town, and being joined by the native population and numerous mercenaries, principally Greeks, whom he hired with the treasure that was in his hands, made himself master of Sardis, and besieged Tabalus in the citadel. The news reached Cyrus while he was upon his march; but, estimating the degree of its importance aright, he did not suffer it to interfere with his plans. He judged it enough to send a general with a strong body of troops to put down the revolt, and continued his own journey eastward. Mazares, a Mede, was the officer selected for the service. On arriving before Sardis, he found that Pactyas had relinquished his enterprise and fled to the coast, and that the revolt was consequently at an end. It only remained to exact vengeance. The rebellious Lydians were disarmed. Pactyas was pursued with unrelenting hostility, and demanded, in succession, of the Cymaeans, the Mytilenseans, and the Chians, of whom the last-mentioned surrendered him.

==== Campaign Against the Greeks ====

Following the defeat of Pactyas, Cyrus dispatched Mazares to attack his Greek allies. The Greek cities of Priene and Magnesia in Asia Minor were attacked and subdued. Mazares was renowned for his cruelty and barbarism and on the conquest of Priene, he captured its entire populace and sold them as slaves. However, Mazares' successor Hapages was more lenient. The aggressive policy of Mazares was retained and more Greek cities were conquered. However, the inhabitants of these cities were treated well and retained a fair degree of independence. Miletus the most powerful and important of the Greek city-states made a determined resistance but was ultimately subdued and conquered. With this ended Cyrus' war in Asia Minor and when the last Greek city fell, he emerged as the undisputed master of West Asia stretching from Bactria to the Bosporus.  
This was the largest Empire till then to have ruled over the region. 
 
==== The First World Empire ====

Following the defeat of the Greeks, Hapages subdued the Carians, the Dorian Greeks, the Caunians, and the people of Lycia. One by one the cities fell into the hands of the Persians and Greek resistance was completely wiped out by 542BC. Next, Cyrus turned his attention to the east and attempted the conquest of Bactria. There are different versions as to how Cyrus conquered Bactria. Ctesias says that they submitted peacefully when Darius married a Median princess. However, this is seriously contested by historians who reject the possibility that this could have any effect on the Bactrians. Herodotus says that Cyrus subdued Bactria after a long drawn out war and this seems most probable.

Following the conquest of Bactria, Cyrus' next campaign was against the Sacae (probably the Sakas or Scythians) who resided in the east of Bactria. Herodotus and Ctesias do not record much on the eastern campaigns of Cyrus the Great. However, the historian Pliny relates that Cyrus destroyed the city of Kapisa in Afghanistan. He was assisted in his campaigns by the Ariaspse, a people of Drangiana (near Lake Hamun in modern-day Sistan). Cyrus then marched against the Indians and conquered Gedrosia (the district of Makran in the Baluchistan province of Pakistan; its memory has been preserved by the presence of a city called Gwadar close to the Pakistan-Iran frontier). Among other countries subdued by Cyrus in this neighborhood, are Hyrcania, Parthia, Chorasmia, Sogdiana, Aria (or Herat), Drangiana, Arachosia, Sattagydia, and Gandaria.

==== Conquest of Babylonia ====

In 539 BC, towards the end of September, Cyrus' armies, under the command of Gubaru, the governor of Gutium, attacked Opis on the Tigris river and defeated the Babylonians after a minor uprising. When Opis was occupied , the Persians took hold of the vast canal system of Babylonia.

On October 10, the city of Sippar was seized without a battle. Nabonidus, the ruler of Babylonia, who was staying in the city at the time, fled to the capital, Babylon.

On October 12, Gubaru's troops entered Babylon, without facing any resistance from the Babylonians. Herodotus explains that to accomplish this feat, the Persians diverted the Euphrates river into a canal so that the water level dropped &quot;to the height of the middle of a man's thigh,&quot; which allowed the invading forces to march directly through the river bed to enter at night.[20] On October 29, Cyrus himself entered the city of Babylon and arrested Nabonidus. He then assumed the titles of &quot;king of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the four sides of the world.&quot;

Prior to Cyrus' invasion of Babylon, the Neo-Babylonian Empire had conquered many kingdoms. In addition to Babylonia itself, Cyrus incorporated its subnational entities into his Empire, including Syria and Palestine.

Before leaving Babylon, Cyrus also freed the Israelites by allowing them to return to their native land, effectively ending the Babylonian captivity. The return of the exiles reinforced the Jewish population in their homeland, which had been waning since the start of the Babylonian rule.

According to the Behistun Inscription of Darius the Great, Cyrus' dominions must have comprised the largest empire the world had ever seen. At the end of Cyrus' rule, the Achaemenid Empire stretched from Asia Minor and Judah in the west to the Indus River in the east.

==== Death ====

From cuneiform sources, it has now become clear that Cyrus' reign came to an end in the summer of 530. Authors like Ctesias and Xenophon give different accounts of his death. According to Rawlinson, who uses Herodotus' version, Cyrus was engaged in subduing the Massagatse who inhabited the desert of Khwarezm. In the first battle against the Massagatse, Cyrus inflicted a crushing defeat on the Massagatse killing its ruler Spargapises. But in the second battle against the Massagatse, Cyrus was killed by Sparagapises' mother Queen Tornyris who dipped his head in blood and reportedly used his skull as a vessel to drink fine wine for a long time afterwards. However, the Persians won the battle and Cyrus' body was found and carried to Persia where it was buried in the city of Pasargadae.

According to Plutarch, his epitaph says,

&quot;O man, whoever you are and wherever you come from, for I know you will come, I am Cyrus who won the Persians their empire. Do not therefore grudge me this little earth that covers my body.&quot;

Cyrus was succeeded by son Khambujiya (Cambyses II).

==== Legacy ====

Cyrus was an excellent statesman and soldier and was the creator of the first world empire in history. His legacy remains alive and is greatly respected in modern Persia. He is also held favorably by the Jews and is the only Gentile to be designated as a messiah in the Tanakh (Isaiah 45:1-6). Some scholars believe that there are references to him in the Quran. Many believe that the Quranic figure of Zulqarnain is none other than Cyrus the Great though it has been seriously challenged by some.

One of his great legacies had to be the inscription of the Cyrus Cylinder described below.



[[Image:Cyrus_cilinder.jpg|300px|left]]

&lt;small&gt;''A section of the Cyrus cylinder''.&lt;/small&gt;

===== The Cyrus Cylinder =====

The Cyrus Cylinder, also known as the ‘Cyrus the Great Cylinder’, is an artifact of the Persian Empire, consisting of a declaration issued by the emperor Cyrus the Great inscribed in Babylonian (Akkadian) cuneiform on a clay cylinder.

It was discovered in 1879 by the Assyro-British archaeologist Hormuzd Rassam in the foundations of the Esagila (i.e., the Marduk temple of Babylon). This cylinder which composed of two broken pieces, now united in the British Museum, and comprises an account of Cyrus' capture of Babylon, a reference to the return of the captured statues of Mesopotamian gods, several topical remarks about the abolishment of unjust corvees, and a description of repairs to old buildings in Babylon. It was regarded as the Oldest Charter of Human Rights in the world by the government of Shah Mohamed Reza, a claim that has been subject to criticism from scholars, who point at the topical character of the document.

=== Cambyses II 529 - 522 BC ===

On the death of Cyrus II in 529BC, his son Cambyses II took hold the reins of power and continued his father's policy of conquest. His original Persian name might have been Kambujiya, which is of pure Indo-European origin and is synonymous with Kamboja. Cambyses II is represented as one of the most ambitious conquerors of the mould of Alexander and Khusro Parviz for like his Macedonian and Sassanian successors he aspired to expand his Empire into hitherto unexplored and unconquered parts of the globe.


Cambyses ascended the throne in the year 530 or 529BC and immediately after his accession murdered his brother Smerdis. 



==== Campaign Against Egypt ====

The ambitious Cyrus had always willed to take his armies into Egypt but died before he could realize his dream. Now with the successful conquest of Mesapotamia and the Middle East, the gates were open for an invasion of Egypt. 

In 529BC, soon after Cambyses had established himself on the throne, he demanded of Amasis, the Pharaoh of Egypt to send his daughter to him as a secondary wife. However, Amasis deceived Cambyses by sending a damsel named Nitesis instead of his own daughter. When he was acquainted of the fraud, Cambyses swore revenge. However, he waited for four years until the death of Amasis before launching an invasion of Egypt.

In 525BC, Amasis' son Psammetichus III became the Pharaoh of Egypt. Sensing an opportunity, Cambyses led an army of Persian soldiers and Arab mercenaries into Egypt. Amasis had always hoped that the Greeks would come to their aid in the case of a Persian invasion but the Greek Cypriots preferred to join with Cambyses. So assisted by the formidable Cypriot navy, Cambyses conquered Egypt.

Soon after the conquest of Egypt, the rulers of Libya and the Greeks of Barca and Cyrene sent rich tributes to the Persian Emperor. However, Cambyses intended to expand his empire further to the south and conquer the kingdom of Ammon in the North African desert.  He sent an army fifty thousand strong which perished in the middle of the African desert. An invasion of the Phoenician colony of Carthage was planned but the plan was abandoned when the Phoenicians in his navy refused to fight against their countrymen. Another force led by Cambyses to conquer Ethiopia had to return when faced with defeat and loss of supplies.

Almost Immediately after his return to Egypt, Cambyses had to tackle the rebellion of Psammetichus III. The priests declared him an incarnation of the sacred bull of Egyptian mythology Apis and the whole country rose into revolt in support of the disinherited king. Cambyses reacted by crushing this insurrection with an iron hand and killing Psammetichus III and the priests who supported him. He then retaliated by stabbing the sacred calf regarded as an incarnation of the sacred bull Apis, killed its priests and prohibited the festivals dedicated to Apis. He ordered the desecration of the tombs of long dead Egyptian monarchs  and showed blunt disregard and disrespect for the customs of the people.

At this juncture, there appeared disturbing news from Persia. A messenger informed him that an impostor had captured the thrown of Persia and claims to be Smerdis the deceased son of Cyrus the Great. 

==== Death ====

Cambyses, the sources tell us, did not live long after the appearance of this new claimant to the throne. But died in a extremely suspicious circumstances. Some say that he committed suicide. However, this appears highly improbable. Nevertheless, while the truth is being investigated, it would be enough for us to bluntly conclude that Cambyses did die in the year 522BC and was succeeded by the impostor Smerdis.

&lt;small&gt;Text excerpt is from [http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/syllabus_hsc/pdf_doc/physics_stg6_syl_03.pdf Physics Stage 6 Syllabus] &lt;/small&gt;

Scientists have drawn on advances in areas such as aeronautics, material science, robotics, electronics, medicine and energy production to develop viable spacecraft. Perhaps the most dangerous parts of any space mission are the launch, re-entry and landing. A huge force is required to propel the rocket a sufficient distance from the Earth so that it is able to either escape the Earth’s gravitational pull or maintain an orbit. Following a successful mission, re-entry through the Earth’s atmosphere provides further challenges to scientists if astronauts are to return to Earth safely.
Rapid advances in technologies over the past fifty years have allowed the exploration of not only the Moon, but the Solar System and, to an increasing extent, the Universe. Space exploration is becoming more viable. Information from research undertaken in space programs has impacted on society through the development of devices such as personal computers, advanced medical equipment and communication satellites, and has
enabled the accurate mapping of natural resources. Space research and exploration increases our
understanding of the Earth’s own environment, the Solar System and the Universe.
This module increases students’ understanding of the history, nature and practice of physics and the
implications of physics for society and the environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Finite Potential Well Symmetric.svg|right]]
We have seen the result of an [[Materials_in_Electronics/Confined_Particles/1D_Infinite_Wells|infinite potential well]], but this is not a situation that can exist in real life - a point cannot have infinte potential with respect to another. Let us consider the symmetric finite potential well, right. It is easier mathematically if the well is centred around the origin. As before, the potential in the well (between ''-L'' and ''L'') is 0, but outside the well, it is a finite value, V (equal on both sides):

::&lt;math&gt;V\left( x \right) = \begin{cases}
                              V,\quad x &lt; -L \\
                              0, \quad -L \le x \le L \\
                              V , \quad x &gt; L 
                            \end{cases}
  &lt;/math&gt;

Because the potential outside is finite, an electron ''could'' escape from the well even if it's potential was less than V (quantum tunnelling), so we expect to see a wavefunction which does not go to zero at the boundaries of the well.

Let's break up our wavefunction into 3 pieces, one on each side and one inside the well:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi\left( x \right) = \begin{cases} 
\psi_1\left( x \right), &amp; \quad x&lt;-L \\ 
\psi_2\left( x \right), &amp; \quad -L \le x \le L \\ 
\psi_3\left( x \right), &amp; \quad  x&gt;L 
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

We will solve each of the wavefunctions separately using Schrödinger's Equation:
{{eqn|1: 1D Time-Independent Schrödinger's Equation}}
::&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{d^2}{d x^2}\psi\left( x \right) + V(x) \psi = E \psi&lt;/math&gt;

==Inside the Well==

Inside the well, the potential is zero, so we can rewrite Schrödinger's Equation as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{d^2}{d x^2} \psi_2\left( x \right) = E \psi_2 &lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging,

::&lt;math&gt;{{d^2} \over {dx^2 }}\psi_2 \left( x \right) =  - {{2mE} \over \hbar^2 }\psi_2 \left( x \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Recall that the energy is given by

::{|
|&lt;math&gt;E\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; = T\left( x \right) + V\left( x \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = {{\hbar ^2 k^2 } \over {2m}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Substituting for ''E'' in our differential equation gives:

::&lt;math&gt;{{d^2 \psi_2 \left( x \right)} \over {dx^2 }} =  - k^2 \psi_2 \left( x \right)&lt;/math&gt;

This is now a second-order differential equation with a standard form. The general solution is given by:
{{eqn|General Solution for &amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_2 \left( x \right) = A \sin{kx} + B \cos{kx}&lt;/math&gt;

The energies here are

::&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{k^2 \hbar^2}{2m} &lt;/math&gt;

In this general solution, ''A'' and ''B'' can be any [[w:complex number|complex number]]s, and ''k'' can be any [[w:real number|real number]].

==Outside the Well==

We will now look at the region with the wavefunction &amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. to the left. The region to the right of the well will have an identical derivation. For the region outside of the box to the left, since the potential is constant, ''V''(''x'') = V our statement of Schrödinger's Equation becomes:

::&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{d^2}{d x^2}\psi_1\left( x \right) = (E - V) \psi_1 &lt;/math&gt;

There are two possible families of solutions, depending on whether ''E'' is less than ''V'' (the particle is bound in the potential well) or ''E'' is greater than ''V'' (the particle is free).

===Unbound State===

For a free particle, ''E'' &gt;'' V'', and letting
::&lt;math&gt;\kappa^2=\frac{2m(E - V)}{\hbar^2}&lt;/math&gt;
produces
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2}{d x^2} \psi_1 \left(x \right) = -\kappa^2 \psi_1 &lt;/math&gt;
with the same solution form as inside the well:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_1 = C \sin(\kappa x) + D \cos(\kappa x)\quad&lt;/math&gt;  

===Bound State===

This analysis will first focus on the bound state, where ''E''&lt;''V''. Letting
::&lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 = \frac{2m(V - E)}{\hbar^2}&lt;/math&gt; 
produces
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2}{d x^2} \psi_1\left(x \right) = \alpha^2 \psi_1\left(x \right) &lt;/math&gt;
where the general solution is exponential:
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_1\left(x \right) = Fe^{- \alpha x}+ Ge^{ \alpha x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for the other region outside the box:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_3\left(x \right) = He^{- \alpha x}+ Ie^{ \alpha x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Now in order to find the specific solution for the problem at hand, we must specify the appropriate boundary conditions and find the values for ''A'' , ''B'' , ''F'' , ''G'' , ''H'' and ''I'' that satisfy those conditions.

==Finding Wavefunctions for the Bound State==
Solutions to the Schrödinger Equation must be continuous, and continuously differentiable. These requirements are [[w:boundary condition|boundary condition]]s on the differential equations previously derived.

In this case, the finite potential well is symmetrical, so symmetry can be exploited to reduce the necessary calculations, by choosing wavefunctions of well defined parity.

Summarizing the previous sections:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi\left( x \right) = \begin{cases} 
\psi_1\left( x \right), &amp; \quad x&lt;-L \\ 
\psi_2\left( x \right), &amp; \quad -L \le x \le L \\ 
\psi_3\left( x \right), &amp; \quad  x&gt;L 
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where we found the wavefunctions for the bound state, &lt;math&gt;\psi_1, \psi_2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi_3 \,\!&lt;/math&gt; to be:
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_1 \left( x \right) = Fe^{- \alpha x} + Ge^{ \alpha x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_2 \left( x \right) = A \sin(kx)      + B \cos(kx)\quad&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_3 \left( x \right) = He^{- \alpha x} + Ie^{ \alpha x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where 

::&lt;math&gt;k=\frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{\sqrt{2m(V - E)}}{\hbar}&lt;/math&gt;

We see that as ''x'' goes to &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the ''F'' term goes to infinity. Likewise, as ''x'' goes to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the ''I'' term goes to infinity. As the wave function must be finite for all ''x'', this means we must set ''F'' = ''I'' = 0, and we have:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_1 \left( x \right) = G e^{  \alpha x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_2 \left( x \right) = A \sin(kx)      + B \cos(kx)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_3 \left( x \right) = H e^{- \alpha x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Next, we know that the overall &lt;math&gt;\psi \,\!&lt;/math&gt; function must be continuous and differentiable. In other words the values of the functions and their derivatives must match up at the dividing points:

::{| cellpadding=4
| &lt;math&gt;\psi_1(-L) = \psi_2(-L) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|width=75|
| &lt;math&gt;\psi_2(L) = \psi_3(L) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\psi_1}{dx}(-L) = \frac{d\psi_2}{dx}(-L) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\psi_2}{dx}(L) = \frac{d\psi_3}{dx}(L) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Firstly, we need to recall that there must exist wavefunction solutions with well defined [[Materials_in_Electronics/Confined_Particles/Parity|parity]], odd '''or''' even. Since the sine function is odd and the cosine function is even, we can search for a wavefunction solution in the well of the form of sine or cosine. We can now analyse the even and odd wavefunctions separately. It will be shown that for bound states, the even an odd solutions always have different energies. This means there is no degeneracy, and thus there are no bound eigen-states which are a linear combination of sine and cosine, and all bound states have well defined parity. Below is a diagram showing an even parity wavefunction against an odd parity wavefunction. These are illustrative only and do not necessarily relate to the given problem, they are meant to confer the symmetry of the wavefunctions only.

[[image:Even vs Odd Parity.svg|center]]

===Even Wavefunctions===

The wavefunction for the even solution has no odd (sine) components, so the three wavefunctions are now:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_1 \left( x \right) = G e^{  \alpha x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_2 \left( x \right) = B \cos(kx)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_3 \left( x \right) = H e^{- \alpha x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Let us now consider the conditions requiring continuity of the wavefunction at the two &quot;joining points&quot;:

::&lt;math&gt;G e^{-\alpha L}=B \cos(-kL)\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;H e^{-\alpha L}=B \cos( kL)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Since the cosine function is even, the two equations have the same right hand side. So we have

::&lt;math&gt;G e^{-\alpha L}=H e^{-\alpha L}\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;G = H \,&lt;/math&gt;

The conditions of continuity of the derivatives at the boundaries give us the following:

::&lt;math&gt;\alpha G e^{-\alpha L}=-kB \sin(-kL)\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\alpha H e^{-\alpha L}= kB \sin(kL)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Given the equality of G and H, we can now divide any equation from the second conditions by any from the first conditions. I will choose the first equations from each set:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha G e^{-\alpha L}}{G e^{-\alpha L}}=\frac{-kB \sin(-kL)}{B \cos(-kL)}&lt;/math&gt;

We now have an expression for ''&amp;alpha;'' (recall that the tan function is odd, so the negatives cancel):

::&lt;math&gt;\alpha = k \tan \left( kL \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where

::&lt;math&gt;k=\frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{\sqrt{2m(V - E)}}{\hbar}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be reduced to the following equations:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{k} = \tan \left( kL \right),&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{V-E}{E}}=\tan \left( \frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar}L \right)&lt;/math&gt;

An even parity wavefunction exists at the energies (E) that satify this equation. This equation is extremely difficult to solve analytically, but can readiliy be solved numerically or graphically. This will be done later. First, we will derive the odd parity wavefunctions.

===Odd Wavefunctions===

The wavefunction for the odd solution has no even (cosine) components, so the three wavefunctions are now:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_1 \left( x \right) = G e^{  \alpha x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_2 \left( x \right) = A \sin(kx)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_3 \left( x \right) = H e^{- \alpha x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Let us now consider the conditions requiring continuity of the wavefunction at the two &quot;joining points&quot;:

::&lt;math&gt;G e^{-\alpha L}=A \sin(-kL) \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;H e^{-\alpha L}=A \sin( kL) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Since sine is an odd function, we can see that

::&lt;math&gt;G e^{-\alpha L}=-H e^{-\alpha L} \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;G=-H \,&lt;/math&gt;

The conditions of continuity of the derivatives at the boundaries give us the following:

::&lt;math&gt;\alpha G e^{-\alpha L}=kA \cos(-kL) \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\alpha H e^{-\alpha L}=kA \cos(kL) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing the first equation from the second by the first equation from the first set (any combination would do), we get:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha G e^{-\alpha L}}{G e^{-\alpha L}}=\frac{kA \cos(-kL)}{A \sin(-kL)}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\alpha=k \cot \left( -kL \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

And because cot is an odd function,

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{k}=-\cot \left(kL \right)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{V-E}{E}}=-\cot \left( \frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar}L \right)&lt;/math&gt;

An odd parity wavefunction exists whenever the energy satisfies this condition. As with the even wavefunction, this is not a trival equation to solve analytically, but can be solved graphically or numerically.

==Graphical Solution for Energy Levels==

Let us quickly restate our objectives here. We wish to find the energies of the bound states of an electron in a finite square well. An energy level exists only when one of the following conditions is satisfied:

{{eqn|Condition for an Even Wavefunction to Exist}}
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{k}=\tan \left(kL \right)&lt;/math&gt;
{{eqn|Condition for an Odd Wavefunction to Exist}}
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{k}=-\cot \left(kL \right)&lt;/math&gt;

We can plot the three functions together on a graph against energy, ''E''. The conditions are satisfied at the crossing points as shown below. We therefore can find the allowed energy levels by reading the energy at the crossings. Before we can plot a graph, we need to choose some properties of our system. Let us set the width of the well to be 0.4nm in total (''L''=0.2nm) and set the potential barrier,''V'', to 75eV.

[[image:Finite Well Graphical Solution (75eV, 0.4nm).svg|center]]

We see that there are six permitted energy states: even wavefunctions at about 2, 17 and 46eV and odd wavefunctions at about 7.5, 30 and 64.5eV. This method provides an easy way to find out how many levels there are and approximately where they are located. While the graphical method is theoretically as accurate as any, it is possible to practically obtain much higher accuracy using purely numerical methods.

Also notice that however small the potential barrier, there will ''always'' be at least one even solution, corresponding to the first intersection. The existance of an odd solution depends on the value of V.

==Numerical Methods for Energy Levels==

There are many numerical methods that could be used to solve these equations. While the equations cannot be solved exactly, they ''can'' be differentiated. This means that we can use [[w:Newton-Raphson|Newton-Raphson]] Iterations, which are typically fast to converge. By using our graphical method to give us a rough idea of the locations of the roots, we can select suitable starting values for the iterations.

The two equations below are the equations to solve using the iteration (the Newton-Raphson method requires a function equal to zero).

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{k} - \tan \left(kL \right)=0&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{k} + \cot \left(kL \right)=0&lt;/math&gt;

The derivates of these equations are needed for the iteration (unless done automatically by a computer), and these are given below:

::&lt;math&gt;
\frac{ -V }
     {2E^2 \sqrt{\frac{V-E}{E}}}    -
\frac{Lm}
     {\hbar \sqrt{2m E}} \sec^2 \left( \frac{L \sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;
\frac{ -V }
     {2E^2 \sqrt{\frac{V-E}{E}}}   -
\frac{Lm}
     {\hbar \sqrt{2m E}} \csc^2 \left( \frac{L \sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The table below shows the six levels in this system, the starting value for the iteration, and the energy to 5 decimal places.

|}

Let's compare these to the first six energy levels for an infinite squre well, which we saw how to derive before:

[[Image:Finite vs Infinite Square Well Energies (75eV, 0.4nm).svg|center]]

As you can see, the energy levels are lower in the finite well than in the infinite well. This is due to the wavefunction extending beyond the well's boundaries, effectively resulting in a larger box. As a larger box results in lower energy levels, this makes sense.

==Finding the Numerical Wavefunctions==

We have found a way to evaluate the energy levels present in a finite potential well, which is usually the only information required, but we can also find the shape of the wavefunction. We already know the approximate shape - it is sinusoidal inside the well and decays exponentially to zero outside it.

===First Energy Level===

Let's start at the first (lowest) energy level, which is even. We already defined the wavefunction piecewise as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_1 \left( x \right) = G e^{  \alpha x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_2 \left( x \right) = B \cos(kx)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_3 \left( x \right) = H e^{- \alpha x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Now that we know the energy of the level, we can easily compute ''k'' and ''&amp;alpha;''. This means that we just have to find ''G'', ''B'' and ''H''. We have already shown that ''G=H''. Because we will have to normalise the wavefunction later anyway, we can manipulate the scaling of the functions at this point without consequence. Let us set the value of ''B'' to 1. This way we just have to find the value of ''G'' (=''H'') which satisfies the continuity bondary condition:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_3(L) = \psi_2(L) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;G e^{-\alpha L}= \cos(kL)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging,

::&lt;math&gt;G=\frac{\cos(kL)}{e^{-\alpha L}}&lt;/math&gt;

The values of ''k'' and ''&amp;alpha;'' and ''E'' at the first energy level

*''E'' = 1.89660eV = 3.03868 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; J
*''k'' = 7.05548 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;
*''&amp;alpha;''= 4.38034 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;

This gives

*''G'' = 1014.31

We can now plot the wavefunction against position. Note that we have not performed normalisation yet, so the units are arbitrary.

[[Image:1D Finite Well Wavefunction n=1 (0.4nm, 75eV).svg|center]]

We can see that the wavefunction extends visibly into the classically forbidden zone (blue). If the exact matching of the gradient is hard to fathom, remeber that it was this very condition that led to the definitions for ''k'' and ''&amp;alpha;''. However, as the calculations leading to this point apply only to valid energies, if you try to plot the wavefunctions for a non-valid energy, you will get a continuous (as the method of obtaining ''G'' enforces this) but not smooth graph, implying that the solution does not fit the physical system. 

Because we have no simple relationship between the energy and shape of the graph (notice that ''G'' changes as a reasonably complex function of ''E''), we can't find an easily expressible normalisation coefficient. However, by integrating the square of the wavefunction, we can still evaluate it:

::&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} | \psi(x) |^2 dx =1&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{-L} | \psi_1(x) |^2 dx+
\int_{-L}^{L} | \psi_2(x) |^2 dx+
\int_{L}^{\infty} | \psi_3(x) |^2 dx=1&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_0^2 \left[\int_{-\infty}^{-L} G^2 e^{2\alpha x} dx+
\int_{-L}^{L} \cos^2(kx) dx+
\int_{L}^{\infty} G^2 e^{-2\alpha x} dx \right]=1&lt;/math&gt;

This integral is quite simple, and yields the following normalisation coefficient:

*''&amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''=66990.6

Compare this with 70710.7 for an infinite well. Remember to account for the units (often nanometres cause problems) when doing this integral. It makes sense that the normalisation coeffiecient is lower here, as the wavefunction extends further, so has a higher area when the sinusoid is scaled to 1, meaning that it must be multiplied by a smaller number to give a unity probability of finding the particle somewhere.

===Second Energy Level===

Now let's consider the second energy level, which is odd. The wavefunction is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_1 \left( x \right) = G e^{  \alpha x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_2 \left( x \right) = A \sin(kx)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_3 \left( x \right) = H e^{- \alpha x} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' = ''-H''. Setting ''A=1'', and proceeding as above, we get the following:

*''E'' = 7.56592eV = 1.21219389 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-18&lt;/sup&gt; J
*''k'' = 1.40919 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;
*''&amp;alpha;''= 7.99293 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;

This gives a ''G'' of 1432.53 and leads to the graph below:

[[Image:1D Finite Well Wavefunction n=2 (0.4nm, 75eV).svg|center]]

To get the normalisation coeffiecient, we put

::&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} | \psi(x) |^2 dx =1&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{-L} | \psi_1(x) |^2 dx+
\int_{-L}^{L} | \psi_2(x) |^2 dx+
\int_{L}^{\infty} | \psi_3(x) |^2 dx=1&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_0^2 \left[\int_{-\infty}^{-L} G^2 e^{2\alpha x} dx+
\int_{-L}^{L} \sin^2(kx) dx+
\int_{L}^{\infty} G^2 e^{-2\alpha x} dx \right]=1&lt;/math&gt;

which gives a normalisation coefficent of 66849.7. This is marginally smaller than the coefficient for the first energy level. Since the wavefunction extends further into the potential barrier region (this is not clearly apparent in the graph, but it is just observable), this is to be expected. We can see this pattern continue through all six levels:

{| class=wikitable style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; align=center

!width=50|Parity
!width=50|G
!width=50|''&amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''

|1||Even||1014.31||66990.6

|}

==Unbound States==

There are also permitted energy levels for a particle above the energy of the top of the well, V. These are called ''unbound'' states as they do not decay to zero outside the well. However, they are certainly still affected by it. Unbound states are also called ''continuum'' states, because unlike the discrete ''bound'' states they have a solution for the continuous range of energies which fulfill
::&lt;math&gt;E &gt; V \,&lt;/math&gt;

Recall the definition for ''&amp;alpha;'':

::&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{\sqrt{2m(V - E)}}{\hbar}&lt;/math&gt;

In unbound states, this is imaginary, which means that we cannot use the same method as we could for bound states. If you look at the graphical solution, you can see that the line for ''&amp;alpha;/k'' ends at ''V'', meaning that there are no more valid bound state energy levels past this point.

We saw near the beginning of this page that the wavefunction for an unbound state outside the well is

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_1 \left( x \right) = C \sin(\kappa x) + D \cos(\kappa x)\quad&lt;/math&gt;  

where

::&lt;math&gt;\kappa=\sqrt{\frac{2m(E - V))}{\hbar^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The solution inside the well is the same as for the bound states:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_2 \left( x \right) = A \sin{kx} + B \cos{kx}&lt;/math&gt;

Becaue the potential is symmetric around the origin, there must be solutions of defined parity also for unbound states, so we will choose a basis of odd and even wavefunctions. As before, we know that the overall wavefunction must be continuous and differentiable. In other words the values of the functions and their derivatives must match up at the dividing points:

::{| cellpadding=4
| &lt;math&gt;\psi_1(-L) = \psi_2(-L) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|width=75|
| &lt;math&gt;\psi_1(L) = \psi_2(L) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\psi_1}{dx}(-L) = \frac{d\psi_2}{dx}(-L) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\psi_1}{dx}(L) = \frac{d\psi_2}{dx}(L) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Odd Wavefunctions===
For odd wavefunctions, we can ignore the cosine terms for &lt;math&gt;\psi_2&lt;/math&gt;, but not for &lt;math&gt;\psi_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi_3&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_2 \left( x \right) = A \sin{kx} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_1 \left( x \right) = C \sin{\kappa x} + D \cos{\kappa x}=C \sin{(\kappa x-\phi)}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_3 \left( x \right) = E \sin{\kappa x} + F \cos{\kappa x}=C \sin{(\kappa x+\phi)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\psi_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi_3&lt;/math&gt; are not odd functions on their own, but the general function &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; defined for all x is odd, noting that for any &lt;math&gt;x_0 &gt; L&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_1 \left( -x_{0} \right) = \psi_3 \left( x_{0} \right)&lt;/math&gt; 

Applying the boundary condition of continuity of the wavefunction, we get the same result at each boundary:

::&lt;math&gt;C \sin{(\kappa L + \phi)}= A \sin{kL}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

taking the derivative and requiring continuity at L, we get:

::&lt;math&gt;\kappa C \cos{(\kappa L + \phi)}= k A \cos{kL}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The choice of wavefunctions of a defined parity reduces the problem to tailoring the values of the wavefunction and its derivative only at one point (as the other yields identical equations). Thus we have two equations with three variables. We will choose C, the amplitude of the wavefunction outside the well to be unity. At the end we will normalize &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; to unity over the full 1D finite well.

Dividing the equation derived from continuity of the wavefunction by that of the continuity of the derivative:


::&lt;math&gt;\tan{(\kappa L + \phi)}=\frac{\kappa}{k} \tan {kL}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\phi=\arctan{(\frac{\kappa}{k} \tan {kL}}) - \kappa L&lt;/math&gt; 

Inserting the phase &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; into the equation of continuity at L, and taking C=1, we get:
::&lt;math&gt;A=\frac {\sin{(\kappa L + \phi)}} {\sin{kL}} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus we see that there is an odd wavefunction solution for any energy, well depth, and width. There is a resonance above the well when:

:: &lt;math&gt;\sin{kL}=0,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This is similar to the Fabri Perot resonances in optics.

===Even Wavefunctions===
In the same manner as for the odd wavefunctions, we can ignore the sine terms for &lt;math&gt;\psi_2&lt;/math&gt;, but not for &lt;math&gt;\psi_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi_3&lt;/math&gt; for the even wavefunctions:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi_2 \left( x \right) = B \cos{kx} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_1 \left( x \right) = C \sin{\kappa x} + D \cos{\kappa x}=D \cos{(\kappa x-\phi)}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\psi_3 \left( x \right) = E \sin{\kappa x} + F \cos{\kappa x}=C \cos{(\kappa x+\phi)}&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the boundary condition of continuity of the wavefunction, we get the same result at each boundary:

::&lt;math&gt;C \cos{(\kappa L + \phi)}= B \cos{kL}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

taking the derivative and requiring continuity at L, we get:

::&lt;math&gt;\kappa C \sin{(\kappa L + \phi)}= k A \sin{kL}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing the equation derived from continuity of the wavefunction by that of the continuity of the derivative:


::&lt;math&gt;\tan{(\kappa L + \phi)}=\frac {k} {\kappa} \tan {kL}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\phi=\arctan{(\frac {k} {\kappa} \tan {kL}}) - \kappa L&lt;/math&gt; 

Inserting the phase &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; into the equation of continuity at L, and taking C=1, we get:

::&lt;math&gt;A=\frac {\cos{(\kappa L + \phi)}} {\cos{kL}} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus we see that there is an even wavefunction solution for any energy, well depth, and width. There is a resonance above the well when:

::&lt;math&gt; \cos{kL}=0 ,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Welcome to the Scratch Wikibook ==

If you are reading this, you have done a pretty good job of navigating through this Wikibook.  The tone I'm trying to set for this Wikibook is one of being rather relaxed, and to try out some very new ideas for textbook development, but also allow traditional &quot;textbook-like&quot; content to be created.  Please help me in discussing your thoughts and criticisms about this Wikibook, and keep the goal in mind that we are here to help people learn about Scratch.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:17, 27 May 2007 (UTC)
The Wikibook is going through a major period of changes as it is updated to Scratch 1.4 By me Tanderson11, I am updating images and adding terminology as my current project now. --[[User:Tanderson11|Tanderson11]] ([[User talk:Tanderson11|talk]]) 23:20, 31 December 2009 (UTC)

I applaud the start of a tutorial on Scratch, but I don't know if I have time to develop any materials for it.
If you see anything in my Tech News (http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~karplus/tech_club/) that could be useful, let me know.
I'd have no problem including any of that in the wikibook.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Equivalence and Normal Forms==

Equivalence of formulae is defined as in the propositional case:

==Definition 6==


The formulae &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are called (semantically)
equivalent, if for all interpretations &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(F)= \mathcal{I}(G)&lt;/math&gt;. We write &lt;math&gt;F \equiv G&lt;/math&gt;.

The equivalences from  the propositional case in theorem [[Logic for Computer Scientists/Propositional Logic/Equivalence and Normal Forms|4]]
equivalences hold and in addition we have the following
cases for quantifiers.

==Theorem 1==

The following equivalences hold:

&lt;math&gt; \lnot \forall x F&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt; \equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt; \exists x  \lnot F&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \lnot \exists x F&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt; \forall x \lnot F&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; does not occur free in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; \forall x  F \land G&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt; \forall x ( F \land G)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \forall x  F \lor G&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt; \forall x ( F \lor G)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \exists x  F \land G&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt; \exists x ( F \land G)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \exists x  F \lor G&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt; \exists x ( F \lor G)&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\forall x F \land \forall x G&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \equiv&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \forall x  (F  \land G)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\exists  x F \lor \exists x G&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\exists x  (F \lor G)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y \; F&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \forall y \forall x F&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\exists x \exists y \; F&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \equiv&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\exists y \exists x F&lt;/math&gt;


'''Proof:''' We will prove only  the equivalence
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \forall x  F \land G \equiv \forall x ( F \land G) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has no free occurrence in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, as an example.
Assume an interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}= (U,\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; such that

:::&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{I}( \forall x  F \land G) = true &lt;/math&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\text{iff } \mathcal{I}(\forall x F)= true \text{ and } \mathcal{I}(G) = true &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\text{iff }  \text{ for all }  d \in U : \mathcal{I}_{[x/d]}(F) = true   \text{ and } 
\mathcal{I}(G) = true &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\text{iff } \text{ for all }  d \in U : \mathcal{I}_{[x/d]}(F) = true   \text{ and } 
\mathcal{I}_{[x/d]}(G) = true \text{ (x = does not occur free in = G)} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\text{iff }  \text{ for all }  d \in U : \mathcal{I}_{[x/d]}((F \land G))= true &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\text{iff } \mathcal{I}( \forall x ( F \land G)) = true.
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Note that the following symmetric cases do not hold:

&lt;math&gt;\forall  x F \lor \forall x G&lt;/math&gt;   is not equivalent to   &lt;math&gt;\forall x  (F \lor G)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\exists  x F \land \exists x G&lt;/math&gt;  is not equivalent to   &lt;math&gt;\exists x  (F \land G)&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem for substituitivity holds as in the propositional case.


'''Example:''' Let us transform the following formulae by means of
substituitivity and the equivalences from theorem 1:

:::&lt;math&gt;
 (\lnot ( \exists x  P(x,y) \lor \forall z Q(z)) \land \exists w  P(f(a,w)))&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;
\equiv ((\lnot  \exists x P(x,y) \land \lnot \forall z Q(z)) \land \exists w  P(f(a,w)))
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;
\equiv ((\forall x \lnot  P(x,y) \land \exists z \lnot Q(z)) \land \exists w  P(f(a,w)))
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;
\equiv ( \exists w  P(f(a,w)) \land (\forall x \lnot  P(x,y) \land \exists z \lnot Q(z)))
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;
\equiv \exists w ( P(f(a,w)) \land \forall x  (\lnot  P(x,y) \land \exists z \lnot Q(z)))
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;
\equiv \exists w ( \forall x  ( \exists z \lnot Q(z) \land \lnot  P(x,y)) \land  P(f(a,w)))
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;
\equiv  \exists w ( \forall x   \exists z (\lnot Q(z) \land \lnot  P(x,y)) \land  P(f(a,w)))
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;
\equiv  \exists w  \forall x   \exists z ((\lnot Q(z) \land \lnot  P(x,y)) \land  P(f(a,w)))
&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition 7==

Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a formula, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; a variable and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; a term. &lt;math&gt;F[x/t]&lt;/math&gt; is
obtained from &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; by substituting every free occurrence of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;Note, that this notion can be iterated: &lt;math&gt;F[x/t_1][y/t_2]&lt;/math&gt; and that
&lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; may contain free occurrences of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

==Lemma 1==
Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a formula, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; a variable and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; a term.
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(F[x/t]) = \mathcal{I}_{[x/\mathcal{I}(t)]}(F)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==Lemma 2 (Bounded Renaming)==
Let &lt;math&gt;F= Q x G&lt;/math&gt; be a formula, where &lt;math&gt;Q \in \{\forall, \exists\}&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; a variable without an occurrence in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;F \equiv Q y G[x/y]&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition 8==
A formula is called proper if there is no variable which
occurs bound and free and after every quantifier there is a distinct
variable.

==Lemma 3 (Proper Formula)==
For every formula &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; there is a formula &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; which is proper and
equivalent to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Proof:''' Follows immediately by bounded renaming.
&lt;br&gt;
Example: 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
F = \forall x \exists y\; p(x, f(y)) \land \forall x (q(x, y) \lor r(x))
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
has the eqiuvalent and proper formula
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
G=  \forall x \exists y\;( p(x, f(y))) \land \forall z(q(z, u) \lor r(z)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Definition 9 ==
A formula is called in prenex form if it has the form 
&lt;math&gt; Q_1 \cdots Q_n F&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Q_i \in \{\forall, \exists\}&lt;/math&gt; with no
occurrences of a quantifier in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;

==Theorem 2==
For every formula there is a proper formula in prenex form, which is
equivalent. 
&lt;br&gt;
Example:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\forall x \exists y\;( p(x, g(y, f(x))) \lor \lnot q(z))  \lor \lnot \forall x \;r(x,z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\forall x \exists y\;( p(x, g(y, f(x)) \lor \lnot q(z)) \lor \exists x \;  \lnot  r(x,z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\forall x \exists y\;( p(x, g(y, f(x)) \lor \lnot q(z)) \lor \exists v \lnot   r(v,z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\forall x \exists y \exists v\; ( p(x, g(y, f(x)) \lor \lnot q(z)) \lor  \lnot   r(v,z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

'''Proof:''' Induction over the the structure of the formula gives us
the theorem for an atomic formula immediately.
  
*&lt;math&gt;F = \lnot F_0&lt;/math&gt;: There is a &lt;math&gt;G_0 = Q_1 y_1 \cdots Q_n y_n G'&lt;/math&gt; with   &lt;math&gt;Q_i \in \{ \forall, \exists\} &lt;/math&gt;, which is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;F_0&lt;/math&gt;. Hence we have &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;F \equiv  \overline{Q_1} y_1 \cdots \overline{Q_n} y_n \lnot G' &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\overline{Q_i} = \begin{cases} 
\;\;\,\exists &amp; if Q_i = \forall \\
\;\;\, \forall &amp; if Q_i = \exists  
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;   
*&lt;math&gt;F = F_1 \circ F_2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\circ \in \{\land, \lor\} &lt;/math&gt;. There exists &lt;math&gt;G_1, G_2&lt;/math&gt; which are proper and in prenex form and &lt;math&gt;G_1 \equiv F_1&lt;/math&gt;   and &lt;math&gt;G_2 \equiv F_2&lt;/math&gt;. With bounded renaming we can construct 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; G_1 =   Q_1 y_1 \cdots Q_k y_k G_1' &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;G_2  =  Q_1' z_1 \cdots Q_l' z_l G_2' &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\{y_1, \cdots , y_n\} \cap \{z_1, \cdots , z_l\} = \emptyset &lt;/math&gt; and hence  &lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
F \equiv Q_1 y_1 \cdots Q_k y_k Q_1' z_1 \cdots Q_l' z_l ( G_1' \circ G_2') &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the following we call proper formulae in prenex form PP-formulae or PPF’s.

==Definition 10==
Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a PPF. While &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; contains a &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;-Quantifier, do the
following transformation:
 
&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; has the form 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \forall y_1, \cdots \forall y_n \exists z\; G&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;  is a PPF and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary function symbol, which does
not occur in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \forall y_1, \cdots \forall y_n\;  G[z/f(y_1, \cdots ,y_n)] &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

If there exists no more &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;-quantifier, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is  in
Skolem form.

==Theorem 3==
Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a PPF. &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable iff the Skolem form of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is
satisfiable.

'''Proof:''' Let &lt;math&gt;F = \forall y_1 \cdots \forall y_n \exists z\; G&lt;/math&gt;; after one
transformation according to the while-loop we have 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
F' =  \forall y_1 \cdots \forall y_n \; G [z/ f(y_1, \cdots , y_n)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a new function symbol.
We have to prove that this transformation is satisfiability
preserving:
Assume &lt;math&gt;F'&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable. than there exists a model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; for
&lt;math&gt;F'&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; is an interpretation for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. From the model
property we have for all &lt;math&gt;u_1, \cdots , u_n \in U_\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{I}_{[y_1/u_1] \cdots [y_n/u_n]}(G[z/f(y_1, \cdots , y_n)]) = true
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From Lemma 1 we conclude 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{I}_{[y_1/u_1] \cdots [y_n/u_n] [z/v]} (G) = true
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v = \mathcal{I}(f(u_1, \cdots , u_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence we have, that for all  &lt;math&gt;u_1,
\cdots , u_n \in U_\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; there is  a &lt;math&gt; v \in U_\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;, where 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{I}_{[y_1/u_1] \cdots [y_n/u_n] [z/v]} (G) = true
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
and hence we have, that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(\forall y_1 \cdots \forall y_n \exists z\; G) = true&lt;/math&gt;, which
means, that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; is a model for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

For the opposite direction of the theorem, assume that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; has a
model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have, that for all  &lt;math&gt;u_1, \cdots , u_n \in U_\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;,
there is  a &lt;math&gt; v \in U_\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;, where 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{I}_{[y_1/u_1] \cdots [y_n/u_n] [z/v]} (G) = true
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I'}&lt;/math&gt; be an interpretation, which deviates from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; only, by the
fact that it is defined for the function symbol &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; is
not defined. We assume that &lt;math&gt;f^{\mathcal{I}'}(u_1, \cdots, u_n) = v&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;
is chosen according to the above equation.

Hence we have that for all  &lt;math&gt;u_1, \cdots , u_n \in U_\mathcal{I}'&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{I}'_{[y_1/u_1] \cdots [y_n/u_n][z/f^{\mathcal{I}'}(u_1, \cdots, u_n)]}(G) = true
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
and from Lemma 1 we conclude that for all  &lt;math&gt;u_1, \cdots , u_n \in U_\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{I}'_{[y_1/u_1] \cdots [y_n/u_n]}(G[z/f^(y_1, \cdots, y_n)]) = true
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
which means, that  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}'(\forall y_1 \cdots \forall y_n \; G[z/f(y_1, \cdots , y_n)]) =
true&lt;/math&gt;, and hence  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}'&lt;/math&gt; is a model for &lt;math&gt;F'&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The above results can be used to transform a Formula into a set of
clauses, its clause normal form:


{{Box|&lt;center&gt;'''Transformation into Clause  Normal Form&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Given a first order formula &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.
  
*Transform &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; into an equivalent proper &lt;math&gt;F_1&lt;/math&gt; by bounded renaming. 
*Let &lt;math&gt;y_1, \cdots , y_k&lt;/math&gt; the free variables from &lt;math&gt;F_1&lt;/math&gt;. Transform    &lt;math&gt;F_1&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;F_2 = \exists y_1 \cdots \exists y_k \; F_1&lt;/math&gt; 
*Transform &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; into an equivalent prenex form &lt;math&gt;F_3&lt;/math&gt;.  
* Transform &lt;math&gt;F_3&lt;/math&gt; into its Skolemform &lt;math&gt;F_4 = \forall x_1 \cdots \forall x_l   \; G&lt;/math&gt;  
*  Transform &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; into its CNF &lt;math&gt;G\prime = (\bigwedge^n_{i=1} ~(\bigvee^m_{j=1} ~L_{i,j}))&lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;L_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is a literal. This results in    &lt;math&gt;F_5 =  \forall   x_1 \cdots \forall x_l   \; G\prime&lt;/math&gt; 
*Write &lt;math&gt;F_5&lt;/math&gt; as a set of clauses:  &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;F_6 =  \{C_1, \cdots , C_n\} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C_i = \{L_{i,1}, \cdots , L_{i,m}\} &lt;/math&gt;  &lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;}}


==Problems==
====Problem 6 (Predicate)====

Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be  a formula, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; a variable and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; a term. Then &lt;math&gt;F[x/t]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the formula which results from &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; by replacing  every free
occurrence of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;  by &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Give a formal definition of this three argument function  &lt;math&gt;F[x/t]&lt;/math&gt;,  by induction over  the structure of

#&lt;math&gt;\forall x (p(x) \to (q(x) \lor r(x))) \not\equiv \forall x (p(x) \to q(x)) \lor \forall x (p(x) \to r(x))&lt;/math&gt;

#&lt;math&gt;\forall x (F \lor G) \not\equiv \forall x F \lor \forall x G&lt;/math&gt; 
#If &lt;math&gt;G = F[x/t]&lt;/math&gt;, than  &lt;math&gt;G \models \exists x F&lt;/math&gt;.  
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Finding and Downloading Scratch ==

Scratch is available without cost from the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the [[w:MIT Media Lab|MIT Media Lab]] at the following URL:

http://scratch.mit.edu/download

It is available for the following Operating Systems:

*Windows 98/NT/2000/XP/Vista
*Mac OS X version 10.3 or later
*Linux - in various distribution flavors but it is currently experimental and an installer does not yet exist.

A minimum of 120 megabytes of hard drive space are requested to hold the Scratch basic multimedia pack and software.

Screen pixel size should be 1024 x 768 or larger, thousands or millions of colors (16-bit color or greater)

There are some aspects of Scratch where CPU performance can be an issue, but basic computers capable of running any of the above operating systems should work for most simple Scratch projects.  Scratch is likely to be on the default installation for the [[w:XO-1 (laptop)|XO-1]] computer, to give an example of the kind of computer capable of using this software.

===Linux Version===

A version of Scratch for Linux is available from the scratch website at http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Scratch_on_Linux

This is missing some features of the Windows and Mac versions of Scratch, but you are able to edit, create, and otherwise interact with Scratch using most of the blocks.

Forum threads about the Linux version of Scratch can be found here:

*http://scratch.mit.edu/forums/viewtopic.php?id=21
*http://scratch.mit.edu/forums/viewtopic.php?id=305

== Network (LAN) issues in a classroom ==

Scratch can be installed successfully on a shared network hard drive or other data sharing device that is commonly found in a classroom setting.  This can give your students and advantage of being able to share a larger variety of multi media resources, and perhaps even to share project ideas between students.  Specific details would have to be worked out with your district network technology specialist.

Several instructors and the Scratch development team have been successful at networking access to the Scratch software, both on a Mac as well as on a PC (Windows) architecture.  Some user management software may cause some additional problems, but somebody with some competence at dealing with networking issues ought to be able to resolve these issues.

Scratch forum threads dealing with this specific topic can be found at the following places:
*http://scratch.mit.edu/forums/viewtopic.php?id=194
*http://scratch.mit.edu/forums/viewtopic.php?id=210

It should be noted that the first version of Scratch (version 1.1) exhibited some buggy behavior in networking environments due to user permission management options.  These bugs can usually be worked around, and mainly deal with trying to load or save files when user permission has been denied.  The &quot;default&quot; directories for both loading and saving files are sub-directories of the software folder itself.  In this situation, you may want to encourage students to load and save through the documents folder. Most of these problems appear to have been fixed in v1.2.1.

== Embedding Scratch ==

A Java applet has been written for use with Scratch applications, allowing you to &quot;embed&quot; a Scratch project within a web page.  This applet is demonstrated on the main Scratch website, but you can also copy this applet to be used on your own website or blog.  If you have uploaded content to the Scratch website, you can click the embed link on the project page and copy the HTML to embed it.

Some information that goes into greater depth about hosting all of the files &quot;locally&quot; on your own web server can be found here:

*http://scratch.mit.edu/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=584
*http://scratch.mit.edu/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=763

== Scratch Projects on a &quot;Live CD-ROM&quot; ==

If you plan on sharing Scratch projects, you may want to include the Scratch software together with the project you created.  As Scratch is an interpreted language instead of something which is compiled, you must include the interpreter together with your projects.  
All of these files can be found in the installation directory of Scratch.

===Mac OS X===

In addition to the .sb files containing the projects you need

*Scratch.app
*Scratch.image
*license.txt (to make sure that the people who get Scratch know the terms of use of this software... a legal requirement)

The Help and locale subdirectories are probably also important 

===Windows===

The following are some critical files that must be kept together with your Scratch project if you don't want to install the complete edition of Scratch on somebody else's computer:

*Scratch.exe
*Scratch.image
*Scratch.ini
*ScratchPlugin.dll
*Mpeg3Plugin.dll
*license.txt (to make sure that the people who get Scratch know the terms of use of this software... a legal requirement)

While not a &quot;requirement&quot;, you have a couple of options to make it easier for somebody to start your project right away:

=====Create a &quot;batch file&quot; for your project=====

All you need to do here is to open a text editor like &quot;Notepad&quot; or &quot;Wordpad&quot; and type something like this line:

  Scratch.exe Scratch.image project.sb

Substitute the name of your project that you want to share with the name &quot;project.sb&quot;

Save this file with the name &quot;clickme.bat&quot; or some other name that also ends in &quot;.bat&quot;.  This creates a command line &quot;batch file&quot; which used to be common in MS-DOS, but is still used in Windows.

=====Create a Windows shortcut=====

Open Windows Explorer and create a new temporary folder where you are going to put all of these files before you put them on your CD-ROM.

Next, use the right mouse button and click in the folder space, selecting the option &quot;New&quot;, and the sub-option &quot;shortcut&quot;.

When it asks for the name of the file, type in the same information listed above that is inside the batch file.

Click on the &quot;Next&quot; button, and the shortcut file should be created by Windows.

Finally, type in what you want to call this shortcut.  Something simple like &quot;Click Me&quot; or &quot;My Cool Project&quot; is suggested.

== Overview ==

The '''''Bubble-Head Charm''''' makes a pocket of breathable air about the caster's head.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

This charm has been seen used in two places so far.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] use the Bubble-Head Charm in the Second Task. This charm allows them to survive underwater, giving them breathing air, for the time necessary to carry out their task.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] is appointed Headmaster, discipline at the school falls apart. Because she is afraid that the teachers might act to undermine her, Umbridge basically removes any authority they have, which leaves her and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]] the impossible task of maintaining discipline in a school of possibly 680 adolescent witches and wizards. While teachers can maintain order in their individual classrooms, nobody will take responsibility for the hallways, which become littered with &lt;!-- should we include [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dungbomb|dungbombs]] in Magic? they seem t be fully defined by their name --&gt;dungbombs, which Filch, being a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Squib|Squib]], is largely powerless to clean up. It becomes common practice for the students to use a Bubble-Head Charm on themselves between classes, because the hallways smell so bad.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Parity in 1 Dimension==

Parity is one dimension is essentially a statement of the wavefunction's &quot;evenness&quot; or &quot;oddness&quot;. This is how the wavefunction behaves when it is reflected about the point ''x''=0:


{|align=center
|&lt;math&gt;\psi\left(x \right)=\psi \left(-x \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|width=75|
|&lt;math&gt;\psi\left(x \right)=-\psi \left(-x \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;|'''Even Parity'''
|
|align=&quot;center&quot;|'''Odd Parity'''
|}


Parity is important in scenarios such as the [[Materials_in_Electronics/Confined_Particles/1D_Finite_Wells|1D finite square potential well]]. Because the well is symmetrical about its midpoint, it follows that the electron's proabability density is also symmetrical about the midpoint (i.e. ''even''). Recall that the probability density is given by the wavefunction multiplied by its conjugate. The statement of the evenness of the porobability is therefore:

::&lt;math&gt;\psi\left(x \right)^* \psi\left(x \right)=\psi\left(-x \right)^* \psi\left(-x \right)&lt;/math&gt;


The theory of [[w:even and odd functions|even and odd functions]] shows that either an odd or even function multiplied by itself yields an even function, but a linear compination will not. Therefore, this condition can only be fulfilled if the wavefunction parity is either even or odd. It cannot be fulfilled if the wavefunction parity is a linear combination of even and odd functions, as this kind of combination produces neither an even or odd function.

|Generally speaking, any wavefunction must have a definite parity with respect to the symmetry of the physical system

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Contextual Outline==

&lt;small&gt;Text excerpt is from [http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/syllabus_hsc/pdf_doc/physics_stg6_syl_03.pdf Physics Stage 6 Syllabus] &lt;/small&gt;

By the beginning of the twentieth century, many of the pieces of the physics puzzle seemed to be falling into place. The wave model of light had successfully explained interference and diffraction, and wavelengths at the extremes of the visible spectrum had been estimated. The invention of a pump that would evacuate tubes to 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;  atmospheres allowed the investigation of cathode rays. X-rays would soon be confirmed as electromagnetic radiation and patterns in the Periodic Table appeared to be nearly complete. The nature of cathode rays was resolved with the measurement of the charge on the electron soon to follow. There was a small number of experimental observations still unexplained but this, apparently complete, understanding of the world of the atom was about to be challenged.
The exploration of the atom was well and truly inward bound by this time and, as access to greater amounts of energy became available, the journey of physics moved further and further into the study of subatomic particles. Careful observation, analysis, imagination and creativity throughout the early part of the twentieth century developed a more complete picture of the nature of electromagnetic radiation and matter. The journey taken into the world of the atom has not remained isolated in laboratories. The phenomena discovered by physicists have, with increasing speed, been channelled into technologies, such as computers, to which society has ever-increasing access. These technologies have, in turn, often assisted physicists in their search for further knowledge and understanding of natural phenomena at the sub-atomic level. This module increases students’ understanding of the history, nature and practice of physics and the applications and uses of physics, the implications of physics for society and the environment, and the current issues, research and developments in physics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book has been started using the initial author's teaching notes from a defunct university postgraduate molecular modelling course and it is hoped it will evolve into something useful and disguise its roots as other authors hack at it.

It will hopefully differentiate itself from an encyclopedia by having a practical rather than reference standpoint and will include a collection of ''problems''.

===Introduction===
Computational chemistry covers a range of chemical applications such as quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics, molecular modelling, molecular mechanics and chemical informatics. Chemical informatics involves very large databases and information retrieval and data mining. Quantum chemistry is heavy computation and hard mathematics. Molecular dynamics is also heavy computation with hard but ''classical'' Newtonian mathematics!

Computational chemists cannot get enough computer time to try and simulate chemical reality as the variety of molecules is infinite and there are a lot of molecules in even a tiny drop of water. However making your simulation match reality requires a complex model and interpreting the data from hours of computer time to yield useful knowledge is difficult.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
'''Cathode rays''' are streams of electrons emitted in a evacuated tube known as a cathode ray tube or a discharge tube. The cathode rays flow from the cathode (negative electrode) to the anode (positive electrode). It is possible to deflect the path of the rays using electric and magnetic fields. This has lead to its use in many applications including the television and the computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Soft Consonants==

Most consonants in Belarusian have two modifications: hard and soft.

Consonants are pronounced softly before y-vowels, ''е'', ''ё'', ''і'', ''ю'' or ''я''. In such a position (after consonsants) these vowels loose their ''й'' and pronounced as ''э'', ''о'', ''і'', ''у'' or ''а'' respectively.

In English, something similar to &quot;hard-soft&quot; phenomenon also takes place. E.g., ''l'' in ''purple'' is more like Belarusian hard ''л'' while in ''please'' it is pronounced like soft ''л''. But in Belarusian these modifications are considered as different phonemes, i.e. their mispronounciation may result in misunderstanding and word confusion.

'''бэз''' &quot;bez&quot; - lilac; '''без''' &quot;biez&quot; - without

'''лук''' &quot;luk&quot; - a bow; '''люк''' &quot;liuk&quot; - a hatch

Soft consonants are pronounced with your tongue moved up and forward relative to its position when pronouncing the hard sound. It is something like pronouncing an extremely short ''і'' sound after the consonant.

'''Ве́на''' &quot;V(i)ena&quot; - Vienna

'''вёска''' &quot;v(i)oska&quot; - a village

'''лю́стра''' (neuter) &quot;l(i)ustra&quot; - a mirror

The consonants ''дж'', ''ч'', ''дз'', ''ц'', ''ж'', ''ш'' and ''р'' are always hard (зацвярдзе́лыя &quot;zatviardielyya&quot;). Consequently, ''дж'', ''ч'', ''ж'', ''ш'' and ''р'' can never be followed by ''е'', ''ё'', ''і'', ''ю'' or ''я''.

The sound ''й'' is a soft sound, and it has no hard mate. As was already mentioned before, it can never be followed by a vowel.

==L in Borrowings: Soft of Hard?==

There is a remarkable difference between tarashkievitsa and narkamauka in spelling and pronunciation of a number of borrowed words. Such words having an ''l''+vowel combination in the original language have hard ''л'' in narkamauka and soft ''л'' in tarashkievitsa.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Original
! Narkamauka
! Tarashkievitsa
|-
|club
|клуб
|клюб
|-
|plan
|план
|плян
|-
|colony
|кало́нія
|калёнія
|}

However, ''li'' and ''le'' are transliterated as ''лі'' and ''ле'' in both variants.

In some borrowings, especially German and French, ''л'' is soft in both variants: '''люк''' a hatch, '''лю́мпен''' a lumpen, a social outcast element, '''лю́стра''' a mirror.

The word '''пала́ц''' (a palace) is spelled the same in tarashkievitsa (though it might be spelled as ''паляц'' according to this rule).

==Soft Noun And Adjective Endings==

Nouns ending by ''я'' (usually feminine), ''е'' or ''ё'' (neuter) in plural end by ''і''.

'''до́ля''' a part, a share - '''до́лі'''

'''по́ле''' a field - '''палі'''

Note that neuter nouns ending by ''е'' can have a stressed ending in plural.

The plural ''і'' ending is also obtained by nouns ending by ''к'', ''ка'', ''г'', ''га'', ''х'', ''ха''.

'''рака́''' a river - '''рэ́кі'''

'''даро́га''' a road - '''даро́гі'''

'''кніга''' a book - '''кнігі'''

'''саба́ка''' a dog - '''саба́кі'''

'''вёска''' a village - '''вёскі'''

'''чарапа́ха''' a turtle - '''чарапа́хі'''

'''бык''' a bull - '''быкі'''

'''выкла́дчык''' a lecturer - '''выкла́дчыкі'''

Soft adjective endings are as follows.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Masculine
! Neuter
! Feminine
! Plural
|-
|'''і'''
|'''яе'''
|'''яя'''
|'''ія'''
|-
|cіні ''blue''
|cіняе
|cіняя
|cінія
|}

If the ending of an adjective is preceded by ''к'', ''г'' or ''х'', its flexions are as follows.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Masculine
! Neuter
! Feminine
! Plural
|-
|'''і'''
|'''ое'''&lt;br&gt;('''ае''' if unstressed)
|'''ая'''
|'''ія'''
|-
|шыро́кі ''broad''
|шыро́кае
|шыро́кая
|шыро́кія
|-
|ву́зкі ''narrow''
|ву́зкае
|ву́зкая
|ву́зкія
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Stress - Brief Introduction ==

&lt;b&gt;Q. Differentiation between Anxious and Stress.&lt;/b&gt;

It is not very grammatically correct to write in patients chart- &quot;Looks anxious&quot; and referring them to psychiatric ward/&lt;b&gt;PSY&lt;/b&gt;-consultation.
Stress is not an anxiety (anxiety disorder), they are not synonymous.

A general concept/understanding in Human-psychology/Psychiatry is beneficial. 

&lt;b&gt;Q. When is stress experienced?&lt;/b&gt;

A person typically is stressed when they experiences positive or negative temporarily strain or overwhelm adaptive capacities. 

In general - Stress can be physiological or pathological. A general concept/understanding in them is beneficial. 

&lt;/b&gt;Q. Who can get Stress?&lt;/b&gt;

Stress is highly individualized and depends on variables such as the novelty, rate, intensity, duration, or personal interpretation of the input, and genetic or experiential factors. 

&lt;b&gt;For an example &lt;/b&gt;
*Panic attacks are more frequent when the predisposed person is exposed to stressors. 

&lt;b&gt;Q. What to do if you encounter stressed person in surgical ward?&lt;/b&gt;

Ultimate refer place is psychiatric consultation, But... pre-&lt;b&gt;PSY&lt;/b&gt;-consultation, we can provide our little help.

&lt;b&gt;Q. Which stress remedies are in fashion?&lt;/b&gt;

*Stress-reduction strategies can be helpful to many stressed/anxious patients/sufferer.
**Unfortunately, many stressed/anxious persons cannot concentrate enough to use such strategies effectively for acute relief. 
**Most stress-reduction techniques have their greatest utility as elements of a prevention plan that attempts to raise one's threshold to anxiety-provoking experiences.

#&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;elaxation through techniques such as meditation, massage, breathing exercises, or imagery.
#&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;e-engagement through managed re-exposure and desensitization.

#Basic elements
#*A quiet environment
#*A comfortable posture
#*A mental device
#**A mental device (a meaningful word or phrase)
#*A passive attitude
#Instructions
#*In a quiet environment
#**In a quiet environment, sit in a comfortable position.
#Close your eyes
#*Deeply relax all your muscles
#**Deeply relax all your muscles, beginning at your feet and progressing up to your face (i.e., feet, calves, thighs, lower torso, chest, shoulders, neck, hand). Allow them to remain relaxed.
#*Breathe through your nose
#**Become aware of your breathing. While breathing out, say silently to yourself the word &quot;one&quot; (&quot;won&quot;) or some other word or short phrase that is meaningful to you (i.e., breathe in; breathe out, saying &quot;won&quot;; breathe in; breathe out, saying &quot;won&quot;).
#*Continue this way for 20 minutes
#**You may open your eyes periodically to check the time, but do not use an alarm. Do this once or twice daily and not within 2 hours after any meal.
#*When you finish each 20-minute exercise
#**When you finish each 20-minute exercise, sit quietly for a few minutes, first with your eyes shut and then with them open.
#*The goal is a passive attitude
#**Deep relaxation will not always occur, and distracting thoughts will come into your mind. When you become conscious of them, ignore them and sustain the breathing exercise.

&lt;b&gt; Defense mechanism &lt;/b&gt;

Behavior patterns primarily concerned with protecting ego. Presumably the process is unconscious and the aim is to fool oneself.
*It is intrapsychic processes serving  to provide relief from emotional conflict and anxiety.
* Conscious efforts are frequently  made for the same reasons, but true defense mechanisms are unconscious.
*Some of the common defense mechanisms are:
#Compensation
#Con-version
#Denial
#Displacement
#Dissociation
#Idealization
#Identification
#Incorporation
#Introjection
#Projection
#Rationalization
#Reaction formation
#Regression
#Sublimation
#Substitution
#Symbolization
#Undoing


====Repression/suppression    ====      
	&quot;One way to deal with emotional pain is to not think about what has happened.&quot;  
* We put it out of our mind. 
* We forget it. 
With practice, this becomes an automatic process, we really don't remember what we did or what happened. &lt;br&gt;
This is repression.

Unconscious (unintentional) blocking of thoughts and experiences is repression.
Voluntary blocking of thoughts and experiences is suppression.

====Displacement====
	&quot;Displacement is simply taking an emotion that belongs in one situation and displaying it in another.&quot;

The most common emotions which are displaced are:
#Anger. 
#Hostility.

Example of Displacement:
Imagine, for a moment, that you have had a rough day at work.

#Your boss has chewed you out, and you are angry about it. 
#It's not safe to take out your anger on your boss. You might be fired.
#So, when you get home, you yell at the kids and have a fight with your wife. 

That's displacement.

====Projection====
	&quot;Projection is the process of taking feelings we have about ourselves (usually painful feelings) and focusing them on other people.&quot; 

Examples of Projection:

#A person who fears he is drinking too much may point out another person who is drinking and put him down for being a drunk. 
#A man or woman who has been cheating on his/her spouse may accuse the spouse of being unfaithful.  

Types of Projection: &lt;br&gt;
Blame is a form of projection. &lt;br&gt;
Examples of blame:
#An individual, concerned about his drinking, may blame his parents for the way they raised him, or his wife for the way she treats him. 
#Eventually the alcoholic comes to hate himself, but he finds this emotional state too much to bear so he expresses this as hatred for those closest to him, usually his wife and children.

====Denial====
	&quot;Denial is the refusal to believe or accept the reality that certain events have happened (are happening) or will happen.&quot;

* To accept the reality would bring emotional pain, so the events are denied.  
* This is the single most common psychological symptom of chemical dependency.  

Co-Relation:
Related to denial is the defense called minimizing.
  
=====Minimizing:=====
Events are accepted, but only in a watered down version. 
Example:
Sure I drink once in a while. Everybody does. It's no big deal.  Once in a while I might get carried away, but it really isn't a problem.

====Withdrawal====
	&quot;Withdrawal is usually used when a person is afraid of rejection or afraid to fail.&quot;

* By withdrawing the person is attempting to avoid psychological pain. 
* The problem is it inevitably leads to strong feelings of loneliness, and it does nothing for the original fears.

Withdrawal takes several forms. &lt;br&gt;
Most common are:
#Silence.
#Running away.
But the use of drugs and excessive sleeping (can) also occur.

Co-Relation: &lt;br&gt;
Closely related to withdrawal are:
#Avoidance.
#Deflection.

NB!
Many co-alcoholics use avoidance extensively.
i.e., they won't talk about the problems at home and they stay away from others to avoid feelings of embarrassment, shame, etc.

====Deflection:====
	&quot;Deflection is a method of changing a subject that is or might be painful.&quot;

Commonest methods of deflection are: &lt;br&gt;
#Humor 
#Anger 
These are the two of the most common methods of deflecting people away from difficult subjects. 

Alcoholics frequently combine deflection and projection through the use of anger and hostility.

====Rationalization====
	&quot;Rationalization is to justify your behavior or to make excuses for your behavior.&quot; 

Examples:
# The alcoholic, arrested for impaired driving, may tell himself, and everybody else, that the RCMP are out to get him. 
#A person may fail to get a job he has applied for, and then tells people it was really a crummy job anyway and he didn't really want it.

====Fantasy====
	&quot;When the world of everyday life becomes too painful or difficult too bear, some people turn to the inner world of fantasy.&quot;  

* Day dreaming and wishful thinking replace action. 
* Combined with avoidance you get retreats into fiction via books and/or TV.

NB!
Alcoholics often combine rationalizing and fantasy. 
The result is:
&quot;IF ONLY... Syndrome&quot;

# If only I had money...
# If only I didn't have a wife and children...
# If only I could do what I want...
# If only people understood me...
# If only I were younger (older)...

====Intellectualization====
	&quot;In order to avoid experiencing his real feelings a person may discuss his problem(s) in an analytical, rational, intellectual way.&quot; 

Risk:
1. This is common among college educated people and alcoholism counsellors who have fallen off the wagon. 
2. This defense often frightens or repels other people leading to isolation and a strong sense of loneliness.  


====Procrastination====

	&quot;Procrastination is another way to avoid painful feelings by
convincing yourself that a problem can be dealt with later.&quot;

&quot;I'll look for work tomorrow.&quot;
&quot;I'll stop drinking tomorrow.&quot;
&quot;I'll get the car fixed after I get a job.&quot;

====Reaction-formation====

	&quot;This defense is simply faking your feelings or expressing the opposite of what you really feel.&quot;
*This process can become so automatic that you actually do not know what your true feelings are.

=== Summary ===

	The major function of these psychological defenses is to prevent the experiencing of painful emotions.  
*There are several major problems with their use.

====First:====
Many of these defenses create new problems that are as bad, or worse, than the emotional problems they mask. 
* Some are just plain destructive. 
*Example:
**Rejection literally destroys the relationships we care most about.

====Second:====
* These defenses distort our ability to perceive reality as it is.
* And this prevents us from dealing with our problems in a constructive way.

====Third:====
* These defenses do not rid us of the painful feelings we have. 
* In fact, by masking them so that we do not feel them, we effectively store them up within ourselves.  

* Emotions are discharged through expression, so by denying ourselves the chance to feel them, we also deny ourselves the ability to get rid of them.

====Fourth:====
* These defenses do not just screen out painful emotions. They are, in fact, defenses against all emotion.

* So the more effective our defenses become in protecting us from our
painful feelings, the less able we are to experience the joyful and happy feelings that make life worth living.

====Finally:====
* These defenses are not perfect. 

* As more and more hurt is stored away, a tension is developed. 
* We become increasingly anxious, nervous, and irritable. 
* We become emotionally unpredictable.

* And when our defenses weaken, as they will from time to time, we experience emotional explosions.

====Ultimately:====
* These defenses prevent us from knowing what is wrong, but they do not prevent us from feeling bad.

This chapter contains the change log of Usenet Explorer.

The primary source of information for this page is the [http://www.netwu.com/newspro/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=11647 Usenet Explorer Forums Release history].
&lt;!-- TODO: how to find out when the a version is released --&gt;
&lt;!-- http://www.watchthatpage.com/ --&gt;

==v2.2.1==
Released [[26 August]] [[2008]].

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #EEEEEE;&quot;
| &lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px; line-height:18px;&quot;&gt;
- if a removable drive which is the save destination has been disconnected - UE will suspend the save queue.

- unpack &quot;auto add&quot; entry has been removed from the main menu as too drastic option, it can now only be accessed through properties.

- as running quickpar autorepair concurrently is certainly not recommended and cannot be handled completely, if quickpar did autorename misnamed files - UE won't overwrite them, but rather will give a rename error.

- auto collection grouping has been improved by handling additional non-standard cases, those kinds of posts formerly separate now are included into a collection.

- for new installs the default &quot;save all&quot; and &quot;save queue&quot; every x min in properties-&gt;general has been changed from empty (option not in use) to 90 min and 30 min respectively.

- small unpack refinements. &lt;/div&gt;
|}

==v2.2==
Released [[18 July]] [[2008]].

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #EEEEEE;&quot;
| &lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px; line-height:18px;&quot;&gt;
- recent folders entry has been added to the unpack main menu, the toolbar and modified&amp;custom browse for folders dialogs.

- ssl code has been recomplied with zlib code to enable zlib compression for zlib aware servers which may increase header download speed. zlib aware ssl servers are shown with yellow lock and the rest with dark cyan lock on the server icon.

- article tasks now are optionally disengaged from disabled servers. the option is enabled by default, properties-&gt;tasks, disengage article tasks from disabled servers. it prevents stuck pending tasks waiting for disabled servers to become reenabled.

- when download becomes repairable and there are pending tasks on disabled servers or servers with maximal number of tasks set to zero - unpack will take over instead of waiting for the user-incapacitated servers.

- proper prompts are given when disabling a server will affect article tasks or when there are no active destination servers for the group so marking for download doesn't result in any action.

- compact binary groups are now much friendlier with threads enabled as to threaded binary (mal)posts (a weird posting mode in power post), when marking for download if an entry is moved into a thread - the thread is automatically expanded, so it doesn't look like the entry disappeared from the view.

- create folder prompt is now optional (edit menu-&gt;properties-&gt;general-&gt;miscellaneous).

- a number of other improvements. &lt;/div&gt;

==v2.1==
Released [[2 July]] [[2008]].

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #EEEEEE;&quot;
| &lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px; line-height:18px;&quot;&gt;
- par2 repair performance has been greatly increased, on average repair is now noticeably faster than quickpar and it is at least marginally faster than quickpar on any repair even without taking into account quickpar pre-repair stage.

- added option to associate UE with par2 files (properties-&gt;unpack-&gt;associate with par2 files).

- repair is now optionally multi-core, but because the optimized repair code is so fast and may saturate memory bus even with one core - press the question sign button near the option in properties-&gt;unpack-&gt;multi-core repair to learn how to check whether it is really needed.

- manual add files to unpack pane option has been refined (unpack context menu-&gt;add), in additon to former add files option - par2 files with related files can be added with or without scan for misnamed with optional forcing reload of already listed files for the case they were changed outside UE.

- reload exact files option in (unpack context menu-&gt;advanced) to e.g. reload par2 set and its data files as they are listed in the unpack pane without choosing par2 file through open file dialog in add option, useful when e.g. files were changed outside UE.

- added recent folders entry in the unpack context menu to show recent save / unrar folders with clear all option to clean up the menu, it allows to easily locate folders even after all files were cleared from the unpack pane.

- par2 menu has been added. par2 zero file can be now optionally downloaded first (checked by default), they can be downloaded with the highest priority (unchecked by default) and the rest of par2 files can be marked for download last (unchecked by default given their download is postponed anyway). when queue is sorted by date the download par2 zero files with the highest priority is recommended.

- unrar password can be now set almost anywhere, e.g for par2 set, it will propagate to rar files or rar set after they have been downloaded given the associated par2 set, which is useful along with the par2 download with highest priority option so unrar password can be set well in advance before downloading any rar files.

- collections both auto and forced with size previously displayed as &gt;4GB are now shown outright with the exact size (not only in properties) and can be sorted by it.

- when associated with .nzb files UE will now feature its own distinct .nzb icon, but you need to reassociate UE in properties-&gt;general, associate with nzb files for the change to take effect.

- other changes including a number of subtle refinements of unpack behaviour; links to forum/email support were added in the help menu.&lt;/div&gt;

==v2.02==
Released [[8 June]] [[2008]].

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #EEEEEE;&quot;
| &lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px; line-height:18px;&quot;&gt;
added &quot;open with&quot; and &quot;open in editor&quot; unpack context menu entries in the advanced submenu, &quot;show password&quot; for unrar password dialog is now perstistent as it was intended to be; introduced in v2.01 features needed small additional article tasks &lt;-&gt; unpack sync refinement.
&lt;/div&gt;
|}

==v2.01==
Released [[6 June]] [[2008]].

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #EEEEEE;&quot;
| &lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px; line-height:18px;&quot;&gt;
includes several organic refinements of unpack behaviour as postponing download of subsequent par2 files (instead of setting/relying on download queue order), applying save attachments settings when discarding download/save tasks (e.g. unneeded par2 files) instead of deleting bodies, plus a couple of fixes, almost all after constructive user feedback.&lt;/div&gt;
|}

==v2.0==
Released [[25 May]] [[2008]].

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #EEEEEE;&quot;
| &lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px; line-height:18px;&quot;&gt;
Unpack feature has been introduced which can handle par2 verifying / repair / joining of split files, unraring with subsequent cleanup with customizable degree of automation. No additional utilities are needed, the program is still contained in the single executable.

for details see http://www.netwu.com/ue/help/unpack.htm and the help button in edit menu-&gt;properties-&gt;save/unpack, the bottom help ( &quot;? &gt;&gt;&quot; )button in the middle of the properties pane.

by default full automation mode is activated, all can be customized in edit menu-&gt;properties-&gt;save/unpack.

several non-unpack related changes added to v2.0 like shell open/explore mode in properties-&gt;general; few small issues with pre-unpack code fixed e.g. not remembering the last current import group in the search service bar.

as to search service we may expect higher uptime after a module has been added to constantly monitor the server state and notify if a connection lost or a server computer went down.

Attention: please note that launching pre v2.0 versions will empty the v2.0 unpack pane in the task manager, since it is sharing string file with prior versions so the unpack related data in the file will be lost leading to discarding the rest of the unpack pane content.&lt;/div&gt;
|}

==v1.9.9.8==
Released (unknown).

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #EEEEEE;&quot;
| &lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px; line-height:18px;&quot;&gt;
the release accompanies the v2.0 release. it is based on pre-unpack code derived from v1.9.9.7 fixing few small issues with older releases like always reverting to the default import group in the search service bar on program restart instead of remembering the last one. &lt;/div&gt;
|}

==v1.9.9.7==
Released [[10 November]] [[2007]].

==v1.9.9==
Released [[1 September]] [[2007]].

&lt;/div&gt;
|}

==v1.9.8==
Released (unknown).

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #EEEEEE;&quot;
| &lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px; line-height:18px;&quot;&gt;
fixed bug accidentally introduced by missed nesting while adding forcing collections - related to importing corrupted nzb files (it appears only one site generates them like &lt;file poster=&quot;&quot; date=&quot;&quot; subject=&quot;&quot;&gt;, data contains empty fields probably because of their corrupted sql database.

fixed a glitch which had place until recently when during search service restart instead of &quot;service starting after maintenance&quot; notification search returned &quot;communication error&quot;. it was handled afterwards by patching the server side, but now the client has been rightly adjusted.

in addition one day before the release the search service configuration change had place - the search server retention has been increased to 150 days in the terms of the current usenet volume (i.e. it may vary depending on the usenet volume) except for the picture groups which are drawn from the old server in the meantime due to large volume of random spam there, the issue might be handled later if requested by the users. &lt;/div&gt;
|}

==v1.9.7==
Released [[23 July]] [[2007]].

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #EEEEEE;&quot;
| &lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px; line-height:18px;&quot;&gt;
this is a major upgrade addressing how the search service is organized.

the new scheme has improved scalability and given ordinary hardware it is able to provide unlimited retention without affecting search service performance.

first though we'll run it with the same retention as previously, then the retention will be bumped several times (the older data is available here) when additional hardware will be installed (it won't require software update). 
&lt;/div&gt;
|}

==v1.9.6==
Released [[14 July]] [[2007]].

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #EEEEEE;&quot;
| &lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px; line-height:18px;&quot;&gt;
in properties-&gt;newsgroups it is not possible any more to set initial filter for the newsgroup list view (filters created in the filter editor are not relevant for the newsgroup list). fixed a rare potential issue with crossposted articles which was handled by non-exact code workaround in prior versions. added more help messages to pinpoint problems after crashes caused by malfunctioning or disconnected hardware.
&lt;/div&gt;
|}

==v1.9.5==
Released [[17 June]] [[2007]].

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #EEEEEE;&quot;
| &lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px; line-height:18px;&quot;&gt;
when using the import folder - the destination directory is now always set correctly according to properties-&gt;newsgroups-&gt;save (when &quot;import&amp;download&amp;save&quot; is selected in properties-&gt;general); the default for new installs has been changed from &quot;import only&quot; to &quot;import&amp;download&amp;save&quot;). 
&lt;/div&gt;
|}

==v1.9.2==
Released [[17 June]] [[2007]].

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #EEEEEE;&quot;
| &lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px; line-height:18px;&quot;&gt;
the default for collections is changed from &quot;None&quot; to &quot;Custom&quot;.

when importing nzb or making a search with enabled collections the focused item will be the first selected item instead of unchanged since navigation and choosing default file name is based on the focused item.
&lt;/div&gt;
|}

==v1.9.1==
Released [[1 June]] [[2007]].

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #EEEEEE;&quot;
| &lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px; line-height:18px;&quot;&gt;
the version notes will be kept short so not to obstruct v1.9 release notes. most likely v1.9.1 finalizes the collection topic in the meantime. refined initial state of check boxes in the 'add to collection' dialog and dynamic changing newsgroup view state icons for files inside collections. added another level of settings protection - user manageable settings rollback when a problem is detected.&lt;/div&gt;
|}

==v1.9==
Released [[26 May]] [[2007]].

* Introduction of [[../Features#Custom Collections|Custom Collections]].

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #EEEEEE;&quot;
| &lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px; line-height:18px;&quot;&gt;- custom collections - a new major feature introduced. it is an option to group arbitrary headers into persistent static collections.

the feature can be employed through newsgroup context menu-&gt;custom collections, add to collection, delete from collection, rename collection and set as current collection (the latter to add to this collection headers without retyping collection subject and author).

in addition in properties-&gt;general-&gt;import/search there is now &quot;import as collection&quot; option checked by default. it means nzb and search results will enter into header views as custom collections.

prior collections has remained as &quot;auto collections&quot;. if a header from auto collection is being included into a custom collection in the state column there is a small left-downward arrow of the same color as custom collection icons to indicate that. operations on auto collections will do include headers belonging to custom collections (but the opposite is not true), if you intend to do something else just expand auto collection and select its files instead.

custom and auto collections can be enabled or disabled one by one or both in properties-&gt;general.

newsgroup view toolbar buttons (or threads menu-&gt;show auto collections/show custom collections) can hide or show collections one or both kinds or none as well.

custom collections can be operated with the same ease as auto collections. they can be used in both binary and text newsgroups.
&lt;/div&gt;
|}

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #EEEEEE;&quot;
| &lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px; line-height:18px;&quot;&gt;
- with the introduction of the increased collection capabilities newsgroup navigation code has been revised as to expanding/collapsing threads and collections with arrow or +/- keys and as to displaying search results and newly imported nzb files, the navigation is now much smoother than before.
&lt;/div&gt;
|}

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #EEEEEE;&quot;
| &lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px; line-height:18px;&quot;&gt;
- in the filter editor new filter options were added which allow to filter all collections or auto/custom collections. e.g. you can create a simple filter &quot;messages&quot; are &quot;custom collections&quot; to see all custom collections in the view filtering out the rest.
&lt;/div&gt;
|}

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #EEEEEE;&quot;
| &lt;div style=&quot;font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px; line-height:18px;&quot;&gt;
- improved some error messages, especially those indicating a problem with a third party buggy driver installed in the system.
&lt;/div&gt;
|}

==v1.8==
Released [[14 May 2007]].

&lt;pre&gt;
- search service protocol has been changed to address future needs

- quick filter &quot;find mode&quot; match cyan color oval sign now is shown in the newsgroup list as well

this release is the concluding conservative release in the series to secure last changes before proceeding with further development 
&lt;/pre&gt;

==v1.7.7==

&lt;pre&gt;
- fixed accidentally disabled dragging newsgroups between folders while refining multiple selection workspace view code.

- this completes the latest series of updates resolving all small issues and user requests as the development is now moving to larger onces.
&lt;/pre&gt;

==v1.7.6==

&lt;pre&gt;
- size left is shown along with time left in the status bar
&lt;/pre&gt;
enable the status bar using View &gt; Status bar

&lt;pre&gt;
- added right/left arrow keys shortcuts in addition to plus/minus sign to expand/collapse threads and collections in newsgroup views
&lt;/pre&gt;
to expand threads and collections in newsgroup view press [[Image:right arrow.gif|right arrow key]] or +, to collapse press &lt;- or -

&lt;pre&gt;
- further refined multiple selection code in vista plus now it is possible to select several areas like in newsgroup view using e.g. ctrl+mouse then shift+mouse

- fixed non-working context &quot;newsgroup list&quot; submenu from within newsgroup list view

- ssl access now can connect through a proxy server (edit menu-&gt;properties-&gt;proxies)
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Intro==
A Transistor is an electronic component created by joining two types of semiconductors. One type of semiconductor is &quot;P-type&quot; and the other is &quot;N-type&quot;.  The two types of bipolar-junction transistors (BJTs) that result are explained below.

1) A P-type region lies between 2 N-Typed Semi Conductors . This kind of configuration is called NPN Transistor.
[[image:NPN BJT.svg|400px]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[image:BJT symbol NPN.svg|75px]]


2) An N-type region lies between 2 P-Typed Semi Conductors . This kind of configuration is called PNP Transistor.

It is equivalent to two nose-to-nose diodes, but as before, just connecting two diodes will not work. Generally, a PNP diode is identical to an NPN diode, but with all currents reversed.


Bipolar transistors have 3 terminals : Base, Collector, Emitter

Transistors are commonly used in amplification , switching, and buffering signals or applied voltages.

==Operating Modes==

A bipolar transistor can be regarded as a current amplifier. The (small) base current is amplified by a factor (typically in the range of 10 to 500) to yield a proportionally larger collector current. But in order for a transistor to perform its task properly, there have to be voltages applied to make the transistor conduct current. These voltages are called bias voltages.

Depending on how the transistor is used, it can behave as a (relatively) linear amplifier or a switch.

A bipolar transistor has three terminals, base, emitter and collector, and two internal PN-junctions; the collector to base junction (CBJ) and the emitter to base junction (EBJ). A junction is conducting a significant amount of current in the forward direction (P to N) if the voltage across it is larger than a diode forward voltage drop (V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;), which is around 0.6 V in silicon. The operation of the transistor is largley affected by how the terminals are biased. The table below shows how to bias the base-emitter voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;be&lt;/sub&gt;) and the collector-emitter voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;ce&lt;/sub&gt;) to bring the transistor into the different modes. The table shows the voltages for a silicon NPN transistor:

|-
|'''Active'''||V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;||&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;cesat&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|'''Cut-Off'''||&lt;V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;||&gt;0V
|-
|'''Saturation'''||V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;||V&lt;sub&gt;cesat&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|'''Reverse-Active'''||V&lt;sub&gt;bc&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;||negative
|}

When a transistor operates in the active mode it will act as an amplifier meaning that a small change in base current will cause a proportional change in collector current. In the active mode, the EBJ is conducting and the collector to emitter voltage is bigger than the collector to emitter saturation voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;cesat&lt;/sub&gt;). Typically, V&lt;sub&gt;cesat&lt;/sub&gt; is around 0.2V.

When a transistor operates in the cut-off and saturation modes, it will act as a switch. In the cut-off mode, there is no base current and therefore no collector current. The collector voltage is not important as long as it is larger than the emitter voltage. In the saturation mode, the transistor is fully on, meaning that an increas in base current does not result in any significant increase in collector current.

The reverse active mode is normally not used. This mode occurs if the emitter and collector terminals are swapped for a transistor in the active mode so that emitter and collector change roles. Based on the descriptions of a transistor given so far, one might expect that a transistor is symmetrical and that it would work identically with collector and emitter swapped. However, the physical design of real transistors is such that the current amplification is much smaller in the reverse active mode compared to the forward active mode, although it is still typically larger than one. This can be useful knowledge when troubleshooting a prototype circuit. If it seems to act as if the gain of the transistor is too low, it might be due to swapped emitter and collector terminals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The large intestine is the final part of the digestive system. In the large intestine, digestion is finished, and nutrients continue to be absorbed. Finally, wastes get ready to leave the body.

__TOC__

==What does the large intestine look like?==

The large intestine is fatter and shorter than the small intestine. It is about 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) wide and 5 feet (1.5 meters) long. It wraps around the small intestine like an upside-down U.

==What are the parts of the large intestine?==

The large intestine is shaped like an upside-down horseshoe. The left side that goes up is called the ascending [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#colon|colon]]. The part that goes across the top is the transverse colon. The part that goes back down is the descending colon. At the end of this is the [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#rectum|rectum]]. This is the opening through which waste leaves the body.

==What is the function of the large intestine?==

The large intestine finishes digesting food. Food stays in the large intestine longer than any other part of the digestive system. Food can be there for up to a whole day or more. Any remaining nutrients are absorbed into the blood. Most of the rest of the liquid that enters the large intestine is water. Much of this is absorbed into the blood as well.

Whatever is left is waste, or feces. This passes out of the body when you go to the bathroom.

==How does the large intestine interact with other parts of the body?==

The large intestine is connected to the small intestine. Though not as long as the small intestine the large intestine plays more of an important role in the digestive system. Watery food comes from the small intestine into the large intestine.

Minerals and water are absorbed from the large intestine into the blood. Then they can be used by the rest of the body.

Attached to the large intestine is an organ called the [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#appendix|appendix]]. It doesn't do anything that we know of. Sometimes it gets infected though and must be removed before it bursts and kills you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The small intestine is a part of the digestive system. It is the most important organ for the digestion of food.

[[Image:Illu_small_intestine.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The small and large intestines]]

__TOC__


==What does the small intestine look like?==

The small intestine is a long, narrow tube that is all coiled up in the lower part of our abdomen (the part of our body we usually call our &quot;stomach&quot;). It is over 20 feet (6 meters) long! This is the largest part of the digestive system. The only way the small intestine can fit into our bodies is by curling and looping to fit in a small space.

==What are the parts of the small intestine?==

The first part of the small intestine is called the [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#duodenum|duodenum]]. The middle part is the [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#jejunum|jejunum]]. This is where most of the nutrients in food are absorbed into the blood. The last part of the small intestine is called the [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#ileum|ileum]]. This part connects to the large intestine.

The lining of the small intestine is covered with tiny finger-like projections called [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#villus|villi]]. They look almost like carpet. The villi help the nutrients in food to be absorbed into the blood.

[[Image:Gray1058.png|right|thumb|The villi are carpet-like fingers inside the small intestine that help absorb nutrients.]]

==What is the function of the small intestine?==

The small intestine is where most digestion takes place. Food is broken down into smaller and smaller particles. Finally, when the particles are small enough, they are absorbed into the blood. The blood carries the nutrients to all parts of the body.

==How does the small intestine interact with other parts of the body?==

The small intestine is connected to the stomach. Food that the stomach has begun to digest moves into the small intestine. After it moves through the small intestine, food moves on the large intestine. Like other organs, the small intestine gets oxygen from blood vessels. The blood in the small intestine also carries the nutrients from food to the rest of the body.

The small intestine gets [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#enzyme|enzymes]] from two important glands, called the liver and the pancreas. The liver is the largest organ in our bodies. It makes a liquid called [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#bile|bile]] that helps digest fat. The bile is stored in another organ called the gall bladder. The pancreas makes a juice that breaks down sugars and [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#starch|starches]].

[[Image:Stomach_diagram.gif]]

The stomach is a part of the digestive system. It is where food is stored and where digestion continues after food is chewed and swallowed.

==What does the stomach look like?==
Many people think the stomach is near the belly button. However, it is really higher up. The stomach is behind the lower part of the ribs.

The stomach is a bag or pouch made of muscle. It is about the size of a grapefruit. The stomach stretches when it is full of food.
It also has an exit and an entrance.

==What are the parts of the stomach?==
At the top of the stomach is a tube where food comes in from the [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#esophagus|esophagus]]. When you swallow, this tube opens so food can go in the stomach.

The stomach is made of muscle. These muscles help to break down food by mashing it into smaller pieces.  The muscles also make waves pushing the food further down the digestive track. This is called [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#peristalsis|peristalsis]] and happens from the esophagus all the way to the large intestine.

The stomach is lined with glands. These special cells make a liquid that is released into the stomach. This liquid is called gastric juice. The gastric juice has acid in it and helps break down or digest food.

The bottom part of the stomach is called the [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#pyloric|pyloric]] area. At the bottom of the stomach is another opening. This leads to the small intestine.

One of the most important parts of the stomach (and generally of the digestive system) is the bacterial fauna that populates it. Distinct to the specific environment, and part of a system that produces enzymes necessary to process some foods or optimize what can be extracted from what we ingest. A symbiotic (mutual beneficial) relation that is created and updated from birth, including the milk a baby gets from his mother.

==What is the function of the stomach?==
The stomach stores food and begins to digest it. It does this by using its muscles to crush food into smaller pieces. The stomach also uses chemicals such as acid to break down food.

==How does the stomach interact with other parts of the body?==
The stomach does its job without you thinking about it. It is controlled by the nervous system. The nerves help tell you when to feel hungry. They also tell your stomach when to start making more chemicals for digestion. 

The inner layer of the stomach has blood vessels in it. The blood supplies oxygen to the stomach so it can do its work.

Muscles in the stomach help move food through it. After the stomach has done its work, the food moves on to the small intestine.

==How can you keep your stomach healthy?==
Good digestion begins with chewing. Chewing food well and eating slowly is good for your stomach. 

Eat when you're hungry. Don't eat too much or too little food. Try to eat food that doesn't have too much fat or sugar. Include vegetables and fruit in your diet. If you eat something that often makes your stomach hurt or feel bad, avoid that food.

The United States (US) has traditionally been considered as having the best healthcare system in the world, both in terms of technical advances, healthcare quality, and overall health outcomes. The US currently spends more per capita on health care than any other developed country in the world. With increasing globalization and information sharing, many have begun to question the US leadership role in health care by challenging the value (outcomes/price) of the health care that is delivered. Shocking awareness of patient safety, clinical efficiency, and overall quality of the US healthcare system, along with concerns about spiraling costs, increasing uninsured population, and the questionable sustainability of the overall system have created a vigorous healthcare debate within the US. 

Currently within the US 6,000 and 7,000 physicians. 

The US is alone among developed nations with the notable absence of a universal healthcare system. The US system is primarily one of private insurance, with governmental insurance provided for citizens on the healthcare fringe. Insurance is provided by large risk bearing corporate entities, who organize health care delivery by negotiating pricing and services with provider (physicians and hospitals) organizations. Beginning with World War II, most insurance was paid for by employers who offer health care benefits as a form of compensation to attract employees.   However, with excessive inflation of healthcare costs (sometimes 2-3X consumer pricing index), many employers are being forced to reduce the health care related benefits. This has led to employees having to bear an increasing percentage of healthcare costs on their own. This has been a significant contributing factor in the rise of the people without health insurance in the US, currently estimated at 45 million or nearly 17% of the population. This has perpetuated a situation where those least able to pay actually pay more for their healthcare, thus perpetuating a vicious cycle of zero-sum cost shifting.

In addition to private health care, the US system has several public funded components:
* '''Medicare''' is a federally funded government program providing coverage for the elderly and disabled with a historical work record. Originally created in 1965 as part of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_%28United_States%29 Social Security Act], the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_%28United_States%29 Medicare program] consists of four parts, which provides for hospital, medical, and prescription drug benefits. The program is under heavy scrutiny, and heavily influencing the pricing of the private healthcare insurance program in the US.
* '''Medicaid''' is a joint federal and state program providing tax-financed coverage to low-income and disabled persons (indigents). The care in both Medicare and Medicaid is generally provided by privately owned hospitals or physicians in private practice, but public hospitals are common in older cities.
* '''Workers Compensation''' is a government mandated form of insurance to cover work related injuries. Wage replacement benefits vary considerably state-to-state and employers bear the cost of this insurance. Businesses with considerable risks, such as bridge-building, mining, or meat processing face far higher worker compensation insurance costs than do office based clerical businesses. This can create disequities and inefficiencies in the market place, with the ultimate cost of this program passed along to the consumer in the form of higher prices. 
* '''The Department of Veterans Affairs''' directly provides health care to injured U.S. military veterans and current servicemen and women through a nationwide network of government hospitals (non-injured veterans are often not covered). Using tax payer dollars, the US government built out the largest integrated network of hospitals and clinics in the country. The VA was also one of the first healthcare organizations to fully deploy an electronic health record system wide, complete with computerized physician order entry and bar code medications. These innovations have enabled the VA to become the leading provider of high quality care in the United States. 
* '''The Indian Health Service''' provides public funded care for Native Americans as part of the various settlements achieved in the early 20th century. With over 40 hospitals, and more 500 clinics conveniently located on or near reservations, the IHS serves a populations of nearly 3 million people. IHS is recognized throughout the healthcare industry as having developed some of the most innovative population based measurement and monitoring software that has improved health care outcomes. 

Many believe that the US private health system is on the verge of collapse. Data to support this can be found in the patient safety, clinical efficiency, spiraling costs, and healthcare quality issues that plague the system. A few alarming statistics:

* Nearly 100,000 people die each year from preventable medical disease. 
* 1 in 5 lab tests requested because prior results not available
* 1 in 6 hospitalizations complicated by medication errors
* 1 in 7 admissions because prior health history not accessible
* 1 in 8 physician orders not executed as written
* 1 in 20 outpatient prescriptions improperly processed
* Nearly every encounter exhibits variations from best practices
* Providers rewarded for reactive care not outcome-based care
* Patients, providers, and payers are increasingly dissatisfied

The cost of medicines is frequently not covered by insurances and it is common for U.S. citizens to travel to Canada and Mexico for drug purchases at prices far below those in their home areas.  The U. S. legal system, which has the highest number of attorneys per 100,000 population of any country in the world, is available to assist in proving liability and collecting the money for medical bills from such insurances.

There have been multiple reform proposals put forth in response to these challenges. Proposals for universal health coverage (mandated insurance for all), a single payer solution (all healthcare government financed), increased consumerism (consumers take a more active role in making healthcare decisions), and value-based competition on results (demanding increased transparency of pricing, quality, and outcome) have all been put forth as concepts to improve the current system. Several states have taken the lead by putting together comprehensive healthcare legislation that incorporates many of these ideas. The [http://www.kff.org/uninsured/upload/7494.pdf Massachusetts 2006 Health Reform Statute] and the [http://calhealthreform.org/ California 2007 Health Care Reform] are leading examples of comprehensive attempts to address cost, quality, and access issues. The Presidential election of 2008 will feature health care as a central issue for continuing to have our economy prosper.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Resources for Scratch Projects&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

There are a number of places that you can go to seek resources for use within Scratch projects that you can add to your projects.

Perhaps most useful is the resources that are automatically installed with Scratch.  For simply learning about Scratch, there is enough variety to create most of the basic projects that will be explained in this textbook.  Still, there may be some ideas for things that you would want to try which go beyond these basic examples.

== Scratch Resources ==

The Scratch Team has created [http://resources.scratchr.org/ Scratch Resources]. A site that allows scratch users to share their sprites, sounds, backgrounds and scripts with other scratch users.

Video Tutorials are available at http://learnscratch.org/.

== Image Files ==

The following are some suggested URLs that you can use to obtain images:

*http://commons.wikimedia.org/  '''Wikimedia Commons''' - Has more than 1.5 million images and media files and the source of images within Wikimedia projects like Wikibooks and Wikipedia.

=== Image Manipulation Software ===

There are several image manipulation tools available to help create images or perhaps to modify some content that you have found elsewhere.  These are some tools that you should consider on downloading or purchasing if you want to make some fine touch-ups on images before you import them into Scratch.

You should be aware that Scratch also has a simple image manipulation tool built into the design interface.  This tool isn't that elaborate, and lacks some features that you would find in a full featured image manipulation tool, but it will take care of 90% of the issues you will have to deal with, and nearly everything that a child would want to do with an image.

*http://www.gimp.org/ '''GNU Image Manipulation Program''' (aka ''the GIMP'') - Available for multiple operating systems and stable in nearly all of them, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS/X.  This is a &quot;professional&quot; level tool that would not be recommended for younger children, but it is a good tool to look at as an adult if you want to try some more bleeding edge image effects.

*http://www.inkscape.org/ '''Inkscape''' - A much easier tool that is designed more for image creation.  This is mainly for the development of images saved in the &quot;scaleable vector graphics&quot; (*.svg) file format, however it can export images into the PNG file format, which can be read by Scratch.  Again, this is a more professional tool, and can be used to make more &quot;polished&quot; styles of images than the default Scratch editor.

== Sound FX ==

*http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/index.php '''Free Sound Project''' - Sound effects that are available under the same Creative Commons license that Scratch uses.  You must become a &quot;member&quot; to download these sounds, but registration is free.

}}
{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.49}}

== Preliminaries ==
This is a version of &quot;Model a Silver Goblet&quot; but starting from a cylinder rather than a cube.

Start Blender or start a new scene ('''CTRL-XKEY''') and delete the default cube (in object mode, press '''XKey''').

Change to Top view ('''NUM7'''), make sure you're in Object mode and add a cylinder ('''SPACE''' Add &gt; Mesh &gt; Cylinder): in the popup menu, change the number of vertices from 32 to 16, the Radius from 1.000 to 1.800, the Depth from 2.000 to .100 and leave &quot;Cap Ends&quot; as it is.

Change to Front view ('''NUM1''').

== Description of the modeling steps ==
The steps in this tutorial are almost all made up of &quot;extrude&quot; and &quot;scale&quot;: so, to avoid repeating key sequences every time,

; extrude :  means
# make sure &quot;Limit selection to visible&quot; is off [[Image:limit-selection-to-visible.png|thumb|Shows &quot;Limit selection to visible&quot; icon]]
# box select the top vertices of the cylinder: press '''BKEY''', click and drag '''LMB''' to make a rectangle around the top vertices
# press '''EKEY''', select &quot;Region&quot; from the popup menu, press '''ZKEY''' and type in the amount of the extrusion and press '''ENTER'''; you can move the mouse instead but it is quicker and easier to type it in.
:''Newbie question: Why select &quot;Region&quot; and not &quot;Individual faces&quot;?'' If you use &quot;Region&quot;, the common edge between two neighboring faces will remain a single edge after extrusion. If you use &quot;Individual faces&quot;, the edge will become two edges sitting at the same location. This may create problems (black lines when rendering).
For example, the following keystroke sequence extrudes by 1.5:&lt;br&gt;
'''BKEY''', click and drag '''LMB''' to make a rectangle around the top vertices; '''EKEY''', select &quot;Region&quot;, '''ZKEY''', '''1KEY''', '''.KEY''', '''5KEY''', '''ENTER'''.
; scale :  scaling is by default restricted to the X-Y plane; although the numbers in the bottom left corner of the 3Dview show Z changing, in fact only X and Y change, and by equal amounts.  '''Noob Note:''' This does not seem to be true in later versions.  In 2.67 I have to press '''SHIFT''', '''ZKEY''' to limit scaling to X and Y directions, as in the previous tutorial.

# press '''SKEY''', type in the value and press '''ENTER''' &amp;mdash; you can use the mouse instead but it is quicker and easier to type in the number.

== Creating the Goblet ==
[[Image:goblet-lettered-lines.png|thumb|E-numbers and construction steps]] This diagram shows the connection between the E-numbers and the goblet construction.

*'''E1:''' Deselect all vertices ('''AKEY''') and extrude by 0.2: you may need to zoom in ('''SCROLL-MMB''') to do this as it's quite thin. Scale to 0.1.
*'''E2:''' Extrude by 0.2, scale by 2.
*'''E3:''' Extrude by 0.2, scale by 0.5 to make the lower knob.
*'''E4:''' Extrude by 4 to make the stem.
*'''E5:''' Extrude by 0.2, scale by 2.
*'''E6:''' Extrude by 0.2, scale by 0.5 to make the upper knob.
*'''E7:''' Extrude by 0.2, scale by 8 to make the base of the cup.
*'''E8:''' Extrude by 4, if you wish to make a flared cup, you can scale by 1.5.
*'''E9:''' Extrude by 0.0, scale by 0.9 to make the rim of the cup. (This will create a new ring of vertices and then move them in towards the centre.)
*:Now go into Wireframe mode ('''ZKEY''') so you can see inside to guide the next few steps.
*'''E10:''' Extrude by -3.9, that is, downwards. and scale by 0.69: you can do this last scaling with the mouse, if you like, to get the edges of the inside of the cup and the outside parallel.
*'''E11:''' Extrude by 0.0, scale by 0.0 to make the inside of the cup.

You now have a goblet, the base of the inside of the cup is the face of the last extrusion, is circular and flat as it derives from a cylinder.

If you haven't already saved your work-in-progress, now would be a good time.

== Subsurfing and smoothing the goblet ==
The last step is to subsurf and smooth: go into Object mode ('''TAB''') and enable Solid mode again ('''ZKEY''').

Select the Editing panel from the Buttons window ('''F9''') and, in the &quot;Modifiers&quot; panel, click on &quot;Add Modifier&quot;, select &quot;Subsurf&quot; from the popup menu and, in the Subsurf display, increase &quot;Levels&quot; from 1 to 2.

[[Image:editing-panel-modifiers-subsurf.png|thumb|Shows the Editing panel icon and the Modifier panel]]

At the bottom right of the &quot;Links and Materials&quot; panel, click on the &quot;Set Smooth&quot; button. At the bottom of the cup you will see fluting &amp;mdash; this is an artifact caused by smoothing and subsurfing triangles on a curved surface. Here it adds to the appearance, don't you think?

'''Noob Note:''' If your cup does not look smooth after using Subsurf and Set smooth like mine, you may have to delete all but two of center vertices (bottom vertex at base of cup and vertex at the bottom inside the cup - '''AKEY''' to select all vertices, '''WKEY''' and Remove Doubles).

== Flattening the base of the goblet ==
The base of the goblet is curved due to the subsurfing, so needs to be flattened.

Go into Edit mode, deselect all ('''AKEY'''), box-select the lowest set of vertices ('''BKEY'''), then crease (remove the subsurfing) by pressing '''SHIFT-EKEY''' and typing &quot;1&quot; followed by '''ENTER'''. 

The final result should look something like this:

[[Image:goblet-smoothed-sharpened-front.png|200px]] [[Image:goblet-smoothed-sharpened-top.png|200px]]

Save the scene for use in the lighting tutorial.  To jump to the relevant lighting section, go to [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Light a Silver Goblet]]

      <comment>/* Isotopes */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Hydrogen is the first element in the [[A-level Chemistry/OCR (Salters)/Periodic table|periodic table]].  The hydrogen nucleus contains one proton.

== Isotopes ==
Most hydrogen nuclei have no neutrons, and are called hydrogen-1 or protium, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H.  The two other isotopes are extremely rare: &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H (hydrogen-2, also known as deuterium, symbol D) accounts for 1 in every 6500 hydrogen nuclei and &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H (hydrogen-3, also known as tritium, symbol T) exists only in trace amounts.

== Electron configuration ==
The electron configuration of the neutral hydrogen atom, H, is

&lt;math&gt;1\mbox{s}^1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Dihydrogen ==
In its standard elemental state, hydrogen exists as diatomic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, sometimes referred to as ''dihydrogen''.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Dihydrogen-2D-dimensions.png|&lt;center&gt;length of the H−H single bond in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Dihydrogen-3D-vdW.png|&lt;center&gt;space-filling model of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Compounds ==
Hydrogen forms compounds with almost every other element in the periodic table.

=== Hydrides ===
In compounds with very electropositive elements, as in sodium hydride, NaH, hydrogen exists as the hydride ion, H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; does not exist in solution because it is exceptionally reactive. For example, if you try to dissolve NaH in water, the following reaction occurs:

:H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)

In compounds with elements whose electronegativity is similar to or greater than hydrogen, such as hydrogen fluoride, HF, hydrogen is covalently bonded to the other element.

=== Organic compounds ===
Hydrogen is present in the vast majority of organic compounds. In fact, some sources define organic compounds as those with C-H bonds, but this definition is controversial because there are some organic compounds, such as oxalic acid, which are behave exactly like other organic compounds, yet lack C-H bonds.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] remains unattached for the first three years of the series. He becomes infatuated with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]] when she arrives for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], but she does not reciprocate his feelings. He eventually falls for the advances of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]], with whom he has an intensely physical, but ultimately short-lived, relationship, punctuated by a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Love Potion|love-potion]] induced passion for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Romilda Vane|Romilda Vane]]. When the relationship with Lavender ends, he suddenly discovers his true feelings for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and by the end of the sixth book, they are somewhat more than &quot;sort of together,&quot; according to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]. Their relationship, though it is interrupted by Ron's departure near Christmas, matures over the course of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] and is further strengthened by his return.

== Event Details ==

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosophers' Stone]] ===

Ron is largely unattached through this book. He is impressed at times by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s abilities, and he and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] do join forces to rescue Hermione from a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Troll|mountain troll]], but there is no apparent romantic attachment.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

The Monster in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] is released periodically and is Petrifying students. When Hermione is Petrified, Ron is apparently more deeply affected by seeing her in the Hospital Wing than Harry is. The only thing that has a greater effect on Ron is when his sister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] is taken into the Chamber.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Ron does not seem to show any particular romantic attachment in this book; in fact, for a long stretch he is estranged from Hermione after Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|Firebolt]] is confiscated, and later because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]], his pet rat, has apparently been killed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Crookshanks|Crookshanks]], Hermione's cat.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Starting with the arrival of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]] students at the end of October, Ron finds himself infatuated with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]], a Beauxbatons student and shortly the Beauxbatons Champion in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. When she comes over to the Gryffindor table to ask if they want their bouillabaisse on their first night at Hogwarts, Ron is almost struck dumb. After she departs, Ron says that she must have some [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veela|Veela]] in her ancestry. Hermione is rather nettled by this, and says that nobody else is acting that silly about her, but Harry notices that many other students seem similarly struck by her.

There is also a spot of byplay going on with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]], who seems to appear in the library whenever Hermione is there. While this bothers both Ron and Hermione, it is not Viktor himself who is the problem, but the gaggle of girls who seem to follow him about, giggling and hoping for autographs. In fact, at this point, Viktor is still quite a hero to Ron, &quot;the best Seeker in the entire world!&quot;

Matters come to a head at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]]. Ron asks Fleur to the ball, but Fleur simply ignores him. Shattered, Ron returns to the Gryffindor common room. Harry tells him there that Fleur is one-quarter Veela, and likely had turned on the charm at that moment to snare [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Roger Davies|Roger Davies]], but Ron does not seem interested. It suddenly occurs to Ron that he can ask Hermione, but Hermione says that she has already accepted an invitation from someone else. Harry, acting more or less out of desperation, convinces [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Padma Patil|Padma Patil]] to accompany Ron to the ball.

This is not a success; at the ball, Ron largely ignores Padma, either trying to avoid Fleur or glowering at Hermione as she dances with Viktor Krum. When Hermione comes over to talk to Ron and Harry, Ron accuses her of &quot;consorting with the enemy&quot;. Hermione stalks off and is lost in the crowd. Ron and Harry then leave the dance floor to walk in the rose garden.

After the dance, Harry finds Ron and Hermione in a shouting match in the Gryffindor common room. Hermione tells Ron that if he does not like it then, &quot;The next time there's a Ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!&quot; Hermione storms off to her dormitory. Ron, stunned, tells Harry that Hermione is quite clearly missing the point.

Even though Ron himself does not see it, from this point in the story onwards he is quite plainly jealous of Krum, while still hoping to get attention from Fleur. He glowers at Krum, and tries to keep Hermione out of the library; this is often helped by Krum's admirers, who Hermione finds very irritating as they giggle at the sight of Krum.

In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]], the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Merpeople|merpeople]] are holding someone valuable to each of the Champions deep under the lake. When Ron and Harry return to the surface with Gabrielle, Fleur's sister, Fleur is overjoyed; she kisses Harry, and also Ron because he helped. Hermione is somewhat upset by this attention that Ron is getting, but is distracted by something Viktor says to her.

Shortly after this, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] writes a scurrilous article for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Witch Weekly|''Witch Weekly'']] that suggests Hermione is keeping both Harry and Viktor as lovers. Hermione remarks that she wonders how Rita had known that Viktor had invited her to visit over the summer; Ron becomes very upset at hearing about this invitation.

As the Beauxbatons carriage is getting ready to leave, Fleur comes over to say goodbye to Harry; Ron is once again almost completely tongue-tied in her presence, earning himself a vexed look from Hermione. Ron is still feeling ambivalent about Viktor Krum, but he unbends enough to ask Krum for his autograph before they part.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

While Ron does not appear to be involved in any particular relationship, he does seem quite annoyed when he finds, in mid-September, and then again near Christmas, Hermione writing long letters to Viktor Krum. Again, Hermione, Harry, and the readers can quite easily see Ron's jealousy, even though Ron appears quite unaware of it himself.

As Ron is leaving breakfast for the Quidditch pitch, on the morning of his first-ever Quidditch match, Hermione kisses him on the cheek. Ron seems bemused by this, rubbing the spot on his cheek as he leaves the Great Hall.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Ron is mildly miffed that Hermione, explaining to Harry that he is now once again something of a catch, does not seem to extend the same analysis to him. Ron is, however, a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|prefect]], which does make him more attractive, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]] does seem to be laughing excessively at his jokes at one point.

Harry and Ron, taking a short cut after Quidditch practice, run into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] snogging with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]] in the hall. Ron blows up at Dean, and Ginny accuses him of being jealous as he has only ever been kissed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Auntie Muriel]]. She says that Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho]] have been snogging, as have Hermione and Viktor Krum, and accuses Ron of being jealous because he's the only one who doesn't have anyone to snog with. Quite likely in reaction to this accusation, Ron starts responding to the advances of Lavender Brown. This is the start of an intensely physical relationship between Lavender and Ron. Harry at one point mentally compares the pair of them to a vertical wrestling match, and on another occasion wonders which of several hands he can see belongs to whom.

As intense as this relationship is, it is not without problems. At one point, Ron and Lavender seek an empty classroom to snog in. The room they find first is already occupied by Hermione, who had avoided the common room so she wouldn't have to see the two of them at it, and Harry, who wants to talk to her about it. Lavender immediately backs out, but Ron stays to speak with Hermione, and is rewarded by being attacked by a flock of birds Hermione has conjured.

At Christmas, Lavender sends Ron a necklace with gold letters that spells out &quot;My Sweetheart&quot;. Ron is revolted, and wonders how she could have ever thought he would like that.

Returning to the school after Christmas, Ron does not seem particularly pleased at the prospect of reuniting with Lavender. He is barely within the Common Room when she has greeted him with a cry of &quot;Won-won!&quot; and dragged him off to a corner. Hermione is wryly amused by this.

On his birthday, Ron finds a carton of chocolate cauldrons that had been given to Harry, and that Harry had set aside as being possibly spiked with love potion. Eating two of them, he becomes instantly infatuated with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Romilda Vane|Romilda Vane]]. Harry takes him off to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] to get the potion reversed, in the process brushing past Lavender. Ron tells Lavender with great excitement that Harry is taking him to meet Romilda. Having cured him of the potion, Slughorn opens a bottle of mead to offer a birthday toast; the mead is poisoned, and Ron, saved by fast action on Harry's part, ends up in the Hospital Wing. Hermione stays by his bedside for most of his first day there. It is noteworthy that, having been silent all day, she finally answers a question, and Ron immediately says her name, and settles into an apparently less troubled sleep.

As Ron's recovery proceeds, Harry and Hermione visit him on several occasions. Lavender corners Harry and asks if he knows why Ron always seems to be sleeping when Lavender visits him. When Harry later asks him about this, Ron admits to feigning sleep so that he won't have to resume his relationship with her. When Ron is released from the hospital wing, Lavender is upset that she had not been told, and that Ron is talking to Hermione.

Hermione, angry at Ron, had been refusing to help him with his homework. When she finally relents, as it seems Ron's spell-checking quill has started making bizarre misspellings, Ron, with a sigh of relief, says he loves her. Hermione says Ron had better not let Lavender hear that. Ron replies that maybe he should, he has been looking for an excuse to break up with Lavender.

Harry, meanwhile, has been thinking about the vial of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|Felix Felicis]] tucked away in his trunk. He has been considering using it in the hopes of getting a love interest better matched to Ron, as well as a girlfriend for himself. Finally, having been given a mission to retrieve a memory from Professor Slughorn, Harry uses the Felix Felicis potion to make himself lucky. He, Hermione, and Ron return to the Common Room, but as Harry is under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], Lavender can only see Hermione and Ron, and demands to know what the two of them have been doing up in the boys' dormitory.

This seems to be the precipitating incident that causes Lavender and Ron to break up. Ron, now no longer encumbered, notices Hermione, and over the next short while, they quietly become romantically entangled. There is something of a double date atmosphere about an episode with Ron, Hermione, Harry, and Ginny. And at Dumbledore's funeral, Harry notices that Ron and Hermione are sitting side by side, comforting each other.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] === 

On Harry's birthday, Ron gives him a book entitled ''Twelve Foolproof Ways to Charm Witches'', saying he had gotten a copy from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] earlier, and that Harry must keep it secret from Hermione. Watching Ron later, Harry comes to the conclusion that Ron is definitely using this book in his interactions with Hermione, and with his mother as well.

While Hermione and Ron do not seem much closer than they have been, there are a few tell-tale signs that they are romantically entangled. They dance together at Bill and Fleur's wedding and when they escape to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]], Hermione chooses to sleep beside Ron, and according to Harry, falls asleep holding his hand. After the escape from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]], Hermione is extremely worried about Ron, who has gotten [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Splinched]]. However, this is all fairly low-key until shortly before Christmas. Ron, fed up with the privations of living rough and suddenly becoming aware that Harry does not have a plan, leaves the group. With Harry's concurrence, Hermione does not shift the campsite until as late in the day as she can manage, and then, knowing that Ron now cannot find them, weeps helplessly while Harry sets the defensive spells and pitches the tent.

When Ron returns some weeks later, Harry gives him the job of destroying the locket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]] which Harry, with Ron's assistance, has retrieved from a frozen pond. In order to try and preserve itself, the Horcrux creates images of Harry and Hermione, and plays scenes of Harry and Hermione bad-mouthing Ron and kissing each other. Despite Harry's fear that Ron would turn on him, Ron instead destroys the Horcrux. When he and Harry then return to the tent, Hermione attacks Ron angrily, and refuses to listen to his story. He relates his story to Harry, however, and Hermione seems to accept it to a certain extent. Over the next while, Harry believes that Ron is quite deliberately taking Hermione's side in any disagreement.

When the Trio are trapped in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] singles out Hermione and tortures her to force her to reveal where she got the Sword of Gryffindor. While Hermione repeats that she had found it in the forest, Ron is almost sick with worry, screaming &quot;HERMIONE!&quot; repeatedly as he listens helplessly from the dungeons. It is perhaps worth mention that, as they escape, Ron carries Hermione to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]].

After arriving at Hogwarts, Ron and Hermione vanish. We find later that Ron, having memorized the sound that Harry made to open the locket Horcrux, has opened the Chamber of Secrets, and he and Hermione have retrieved several [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]] fangs. Hermione has used one of them to destroy the cup Horcrux. Ron now suggests that they should go to the kitchens and warn the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elves]] that a war is coming so that they can escape to safety. Dropping her Basilisk fangs on the floor, Hermione sweeps Ron into a fierce embrace and the two share their first kiss. 

Ron and Hermione fight side by side through the ensuing battles.

In the Epilogue, we see that Ron and Hermione have married, and now seem to have two children, Rose and Hugo.

== Notable Consequences ==

Ron's infatuation with Lavender causes an almost year-long estrangement between Ron and Hermione. Ron does not seem to completely understand why this is happening. Harry does understand it, and with his insight into how rocky the relationship between Ron and Lavender is, occasionally tries to smooth things over between Ron and Hermione. One notable attempt ends with Hermione sending a flock of conjured birds to attack Ron.

When Ron departs and cannot find his way back to Hermione, the experience seems to change him. When he does finally return, he seems more secure in himself, more self-assured, and much more aware of his own feelings. We see him making a conscious effort to placate Hermione. During his absence, he seems to have recognized, first that he truly misses Hermione when they are apart, though he may not yet be willing to accept that it is actually love that he feels for her; and second, that he has rather seriously wronged Hermione.

The eventual marriage of Ron and Hermione is, of course, a notable consequence as well.

== Analysis ==

In pretty much every way, Ron's romantic relationships develop along a very realistic path. He is clearly somewhat immature relative to Harry and Hermione, and this lack of maturity does frustrate both Hermione and Harry in the first few books of the series. It is only after Ron is forced to live apart from Hermione, with Hermione quite likely in danger, that Ron gains the maturity to be able to deal properly with the relationship. Until that point, it seems that Ron's romantic life had been purely driven by others, despite the underlying and unacknowledged affection for Hermione. In particular, his infatuation with Fleur Delacour is driven by her Veela ancestry, and the affair with Lavender, started by Lavender herself, is triggered by the quarrel with Ginny, and maintained by Lavender almost exclusively. It is perhaps apparent, particularly in her choice of Christmas present, that Lavender has created an image of Ron and is infatuated with that image, rather than with the actual person; Lavender has taken no time to learn what Ron likes and dislikes. It is only when that relationship is terminated that Ron finally starts a relationship on a more equal footing, though again it is not Ron, but Hermione who is doing most of the driving of the relationship at that point.

Despite Ron's becoming more mature in the latter half of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', one does question exactly how mature Ron is when we see in the Epilogue that he had to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Confundo|Confund]] a Muggle driving instructor in order to get his license. This use of magic to avoid consequences of one's actions does indicate a certain lack of maturity even almost twenty years after the end of the story. However, the happiness apparent in the epilogue, as he jokes numerous times with Hermione, his wife, shows that he is content with his relationship.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Key to the enjoyment of any piece of fiction is belief in its characters; without believable characters, one simply does not care about the story. The author had plotted out this story to cover a span of nearly seven years, in the lives of characters starting the series at age 11. Knowing that her characters were going to go through adolescence, she also chose to write their relationships as an integral part of the story, rather than simply ignoring them in favour of the main quest, as is common in heroic fiction. The depiction of Ron's romantic life, while possibly not totally realistic (as the end of the relationship with Lavender is simply too convenient to be fully believed), is key to making Ron a character that we can believe in, and one we can like, rather than a cardboard cutout that we could, perhaps, admire. This same attention to life outside the main quest is present in many characters, even those not key to our story; in particular, the romance between the two minor characters [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] is completely extraneous to the main story but is critical in making these two into characters that the reader can empathize with. The author's treatment of Ron's relationships is thus part of a larger pattern, where we are allowed to see not just how the plot unfolds, but how the people driving the plot, or driven by it, mature and change through the 7-year story arc.

[[w:Burpee|The Burpee]], also known as the squat thrust, is rumored to have developed in maximum security prisons. In such facilities, inmates are not allowed exercise equipment, and thus the burpee was developed by the prisoners to keep themselves in good physical condition.

==Steps==
# Stand straight up, with your hands at your sides.
# Bend your knees into a squat position, then fall forward, placing your hands on the ground, into the push-up position.
# Hop your feet backwards, and fall forward into a push-up position.
# Perform a push-up. At the highest point in the push-up, hop your feet back towards your hands and explode upwards in a jump, powered by your legs. Jump as high as possible.
# Clap your hands together over your head at the highest point in the jump.

The terms &quot;burpee&quot; and &quot;squat thrust&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably, however, squat thrusts lack the jumping component of burpees.

It should be noted that you don't have a &quot;private area&quot; of projects only you can see.  If you have uploaded something to the scratch website, it is available to everybody with an internet connection.  With thousands of Scratch projects which have been uploaded, you can have a small sense of anonymity, but somebody determined to look for everything can eventually find it.

There are other features of the website which will be covered in the next section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Parkour}}
'''A Muscle-Up''' is an excellent general conditioning exercise, which engages most of the arm, shoulder, back, and core musculature.

==Instructions==
[[File:Muscle-up.gif|right]]
# Find a horizontal bar or rail about a foot over your head.
# Grasp the rail, palms oriented away from you, and perform a pull-up
# At the highest extent of your pull-up, shift one of your arms up so that your palm is on top of the bar, facing downwards and your elbow is facing generally upwards.
# Shift your other arm into the same position, and straighten your arms.

==Notes==

*Step 3 is often the hardest to learn. One tip is to put your wrists further over the rail than normal before you start the movement. In a normal pull-up, the backs of your hands are facing you, but in this case you want them to face upwards at a 45 degree angle (approx.).
*Perform steps 2 and 3 as quickly as you can to gain and preserve momentum.
*Beginners should focus on grip strength, pull-ups, and dips before moving to muscle-ups.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==[[/Notation/]] {{stage short|50%}}==
This section is intended for those without any experience with Western music notation and associated practices.

Humans with the ability to hear, experience sound when delicate structures inside their ears detect waves of pressure traveling through the air (or any other medium to which they are mechanically coupled). When these waves are regular, and arrive at intervals that fall within a certain range, we recognize a tone, or note. Notes are the basic elements of Western music.

==[[/Pitch/]] {{stage short|25%}}==
When the waves causing a note are close together, and so cause more vibrations per second in our ears, we say that tones have a higher frequency or pitch. Pitch is measured in Hertz (Hz). When the waves are further apart we say they have a lower frequency or pitch. When we hear series of higher and lower notes either singly or in groups, themselves spaced out at different points in time and of different durations, and the variation in their frequencies, spacing, and lengths are patterned in ways that correspond to established rules, we recognize the sound as music.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Pitch ==

'''Pitch''' is an indication of a sound's perceived frequency, from low to high. In Western music, we name musical pitches with the first seven letters of the alphabet: A, B, C, D, E, F and G.

From A, if we continue increasing in pitch through all the letters to G, we start over again at A an octave higher.

The collection of all the pitches with the same name, say C and all of its octaves, both higher and lower, is called that pitch's '''pitch class'''.

The section below regarding the piano keyboard indicates where each of these seven pitch classes are located on the piano.

== The Keyboard and Basic Intervals ==

Interestingly, music theory may be taught without reference to any instrument or even to actual sounds and repertoire. Although it is possible to learn in this way, it is uninteresting and doesn't facilitate solid understanding of the concepts of rhythm, harmony, and counterpoint.

Understanding the piano keyboard's layout and design allows one to easily grasp even the most difficult musical concepts. This is as true for those without any instrumental training whatsoever as it is for those with training on wind, string or percussion instruments.

[[Image:Klaviatur-3-en.svg|300px]]

On a keyboard, the white keys represent A through G, and back to A again. However, there are also black keys, which play intermediate notes that are known as '''sharp''' or '''flat''' notes. It is important to note that the [[Music_Theory/Scales_and_Intervals|interval]] between two successive keys is always the same;  this distance is known a '''half-step'''.  Naturally, two half-steps make a '''whole-step'''. To illustrate the difference, look at the image of the keyboard and consider the following:

The '''F''' key is a '''whole-step''' apart from the '''G''' key.  This is readily apparent as there is another key residing between the two.

Conversely, the '''B''' and '''C''' keys are only a '''half-step''' apart, also apparent as there is no key between the two.

'''Half-steps''' and '''whole-steps''' may also be referred to as '''semitones''' and '''whole tones'''.  Their meanings are precisely the same.

== The Staff ==
[[Image:Music.a.550px staff 1.PNG]]

The '''staff''' provides us with a backdrop onto which we can place music and musical symbols.

It is made of five lines, which create four spaces within the outermost two lines.

Music is notated upon the staff in a very logical way. A note increases in pitch as it moves up the staff, and therefore decreases in pitch as it is moved down the staff. A staff of music is read in the same way a line of text is read; from left to right. Therefore, notes on the left are played before notes to the right of it.

This might be compared to a two-dimensional plane in mathematics. Pitch is determined by the Y-Axis, while time is placed on the X-Axis.

As it is, much printed music contains a variety of pitches, many that would go beyond the staff, either above or below.  When this happens, the pitch placed beyond the staff is marked with a horizontal line called a '''ledger line'''.  Ledger lines temporarily extend the vertical length of the staff to accommodate pitches that would go beyond it.

== Clefs ==

'''Clefs''' associate particular pitches with particular lines and spaces on a staff. It is always placed at the beginning of every line of music for this reason.

A note on a certain line in a staff (say, the middle line) will indicate an entirely different pitch if the clef is changed.

Though many exist and were used in the past, today only a few clefs are regularly used. These are:
[[Image:Music_ClefG.svg|39px|right]]
:; Treble or G Clef : This is usually used for those relatively medium to high pitched instruments. Ex. Trumpet, violin, flute, xylophone, upper range of piano, etc. The notes from bottom line to top are E, G, B, D, and F, with the other notes in between.
[[Image:Bass_clef.svg|39px|right]]
:; Bass or F Clef : This is usually used for those relatively medium to low pitched instruments. Ex. Tuba, Cello, Bassoon, Timpani, lower range of piano, etc. The notes from bottom line to top are G, B, D, F, and A
[[Image:Alto_clef.svg|39px|right]]
:; Alto or C Clef : This is usually used for those instruments which sound pitches in the middle range and is by far the rarest of the three clefs in use today. It is mostly used by the viola, but also sometimes for the cello and bassoon with an occasional appearance in piano and vocal music.

Another purpose of clefs is to reposition pitches within the staff so that excessive ledger lines don't clutter the music or confuse the reader.

The C Clef is especially versatile in this regard, although the other clefs may also be repositioned on the staff to associate a new line or space with the clef's defining pitch.

Exercise: name the eight notes shown.

==Accidentals (sharps and flats)==

[[Image:Klaviatur-3-en.svg|300px]]

Let us again take a look at the keyboard.  As was discussed earlier, the white keys represent A through G and starting again at A, while the black keys represent intermediate pitches.  But what name would you give these pitches?  How would you notate these pitches on a staff?  The answer lies with a notational device called an '''accidental'''.  An accidental can raise or lower the pitch of any given note.  The direction in which a pitch is changed, and by how much a pitch will change (in terms of half or whole-steps) depends on the accidental being used.

When an accidental is being employed, it is '''always''' placed immediately before the note whose pitch is intended to be changed.

The '''flat''' is an indicator that a pitch is to be ''lowered'' one half-step.  It looks a bit like a lowercase ''b''.
The '''sharp''' is an indicator that a pitch is to be ''raised'' one half-step.  It looks a bit like the &quot;pound sign&quot; ''#''.

Looking again at the keyboard, let's start with the '''G''' key.  The black key to the right of the G sounds a pitch that is a half-step higher than a G.  This pitch can be called a '''G-sharp'''.  Conversely, the black key to the left of G will sound a pitch a half-step lower than G, which can be called a '''G-flat'''.

Following this reasoning to its logical conclusion, you will see that a G-sharp could also be called an A-flat.  By which name should you rightfully call that key--G-sharp or A-flat? The answer is, ''either of them''.  In fact, all black keys have two note names assigned to them--they are the sharp of the key that precedes it and the flat of the key that follows it.  This concept in music theory is called '''enharmonics'''.  '''Enharmonic notes''' are simply two notes which are spelled differently but which have the exact same pitch.

Another way to think of it is to treat enharmonic notes like the American spellings of words versus their British counterparts--for example, American ''color'' versus the British ''colour''.  While the spelling differs, either spelling is accepted as &quot;correct&quot; and both words mean the exact same thing.

==Key Signature==
This shows which notes in the song are to be played sharp (the next higher note) or flat (the next lower note). When the sharp or flat symbol is directly to the left of a note, it only affects that note and all the rest of that pitch in that measure. Key signatures, like time signatures, can change throughout the song.

[[Image:Music-keysigflat.png|100px]]
[[Image:Music-keysigsharp.png|100px]]

If a note would usually be sharp or flat, but should be '''natural''' in a specific case, a natural sign can be put next to the note.[[Image:Music-natural.png|100px]]

== Rhythmic Values ==
Notes on a staff represent several things, among them pitch and the relative temporal position of that note. A musical note will also indicate its duration.

Included here are '''rests'''. Rests are the opposite of notes. When a note is notated, it indicates the performance of a certain pitch of a certain length at a certain time. When a ''rest'' is notated, it indicates silence of a certain length at a certain time.

There are quite a few symbols to indicate the length of a note. The system is quite simple. Every symbol is two times the length of the symbol that follows it and is one half the duration of the symbol preceding it.

| style=&quot;background:PaleGreen&quot; | Thirty-second
| [[Image:Music-thirtysecondnote.svg|50px]]
| [[Image:Music-thirtysecondrest.svg|50px]]
|}

The further shortening of durations may be continued to sixty-fouth notes/rests, 128th notes/rests, 256th notes/rests, etc. All that need be done is to add one more flag onto the note or rest for each successive shortening. The practicality of doing so might become a concern as the values become shorter, but it is theoretically possible to continue ad infinitum.

A shorthand exists for long periods of rests. The following picture shows 10 measures of rest.
[[Image:Music-measurerest.png|100px]]

Also, sometimes a note is followed by one or two dots, meaning that the note is 150% or 175% of its usual length.
[[Image:Music-dotnote.png|50px]]
The dotted quarter note shown, therefore, would be worth the value of a quarter note plus half that value, or an eighth note.

Or, the note may be a triplet, meaning it takes 2/3 of the normal length. The following picture shows three notes that take up two beats.
[[Image:Music-triplet.png|100px]]
Other &quot;tuplets&quot; may occur - duples represent two notes taking the span of three beats, for example.  Any number of notes can be forced to take up the space of any number of beats, and if this cannot be written with the standard set of notes, tuplet notation will be used.

== Musical Symbols ==
===Time Signatures===
Music is usually divided into '''measures''', usually containing between 2 and 8 '''beats'''. The time signature is written next to the clef, but can change throughout a song.

[[Image:Common time signatures.gif]]

The upper number shows how many beats are in a measure. The lower number determines what kind of note gets the beat (4 = quarter note, 8 = eighth note). Measures are separated by bar lines. A double bar line represents the end of a section, and an end bar line represents the end of a work of music.

[[Image:Music-bar.png|100px]][[Image:Music-bar.png|100px]][[Image:Music-doublebar.png|100px]][[Image:Music-bar.png|100px]][[Image:Music-endbar.png|100px]]

===Dynamics===
Dynamics show how loudly or quietly to play the notes.

*pp - pianissimo (very soft)
*p - piano (soft)
*mp - mezzo-piano (moderately soft)
*mf - mezzo-forte (moderately loud)
*f - forte (loud)
*ff - fortissimo (very loud)

There is no objective definition of &quot;what is 'loud'&quot;. It is up to interpretation by the musician.

===Other Dynamics===
*sfz - sforzando (a strong sudden accent)
*crescendo - gradually getting louder [[Image:Music-crescendo.png|40px]]
*decrescendo - gradually getting softer [[Image:Music-diminuendo.svg|40px]]

==Final Exercise==
Describe, using what you learned so far, the following excerpt from a piano piece.

[[Image:Wtk1-fugue2-page1-mm1-9.png]]

{{spoiler}}
This piece uses the treble and bass clef, and there are three flats by default, although a number of sharps and naturals are in the piece. There are 9 measures, 6 of which have whole rests on the bass clef. The length of notes ranges from quarter to sixteenth. As some notes extend past the staff, ledger lines are added for some notes.
{{endspoiler}}

===More Analysis===
Piano pieces nearly always use both the treble and bass clef, which are supposed to be played at the same time. Generally, the left hand plays the bass while the right hand plays the treble. Between the sixth and seventh measure, there is a line connecting two notes of the same pitch. This means that they are actually the same note, connected, creating a '''tie'''. When the notes are of different pitch, the notes are played smoothly, and it is called a '''slur'''.

      <comment>/* The Overtone Series */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The interactions of various pitches are what allow music to be meaningfully interpreted by the human ear.



== The Overtone Series ==
The pitch of sound is measured in Hz (Hertz), which is the number of vibrations per second. Young adults can generally hear from 20Hz-20,000Hz, while older people lose the top part of that range.

When instruments vibrate, they do so at specific intervals, usually at multiples of a whole number. For example, 55Hz, 110Hz, 165Hz, 220Hz, etc (which can be heard [http://www.music.sc.edu/fs/bain/atmi02/hs/playback/sweep/ here])

== Intervals ==
An interval is the measure of distance between two notes in pitch and in the '''chromatic scale'''. The chromatic scale is easy to play on the piano - just play every note, including black keys. It is best to print this page out so that the examples can be played on a piano or keyboard. Or, use the virtual keyboard at [http://www.bgfl.org/bgfl/custom/resources_ftp/client_ftp/ks2/music/piano/index.htm]

# '''Perfect Unison''' - two notes, equal in pitch (0 half steps apart).
# '''Minor Second''' - two notes, 1 '''half step''' apart. e.g. C and D flat/C sharp
# '''Major Second''' - two notes, 2 half steps apart. They are a '''whole step''' apart. e.g. C and D
# '''Minor Third''' - two notes, 3 half steps apart. e.g. C and E flat/D sharp
# '''Major Third''' - two notes, 4 half steps apart. e.g. C and E
# '''Perfect Fourth''' - two notes, 5 half steps apart. e.g. C and F
# '''Augmented Fourth/Diminished Fifth''' - two notes, 6 half steps apart. This interval is also known as a '''Tritone''' because the notes are also 3 whole-tones/steps apart. e.g. C and F sharp/G flat
# '''Perfect Fifth''' - two notes, 7 half steps apart. e.g. C and G
# '''Minor Sixth''' - two notes, 8 half steps apart. e.g. C and G sharp/A flat
# '''Major Sixth''' - two notes, 9 half steps apart. e.g. C and A
# '''Minor Seventh''' - two notes, 10 half steps apart. e.g. C and A sharp/B flat
# '''Major Seventh''' - two notes, 11 half steps apart. e.g. C and B
# '''Perfect Octave''' two notes, of the same pitch class, one octave apart (12 half steps apart). e.g. C and the next highest C

Note that there are 12 '''different''' pitch classes within an octave (the octave is generally not counted because it is the same pitch class as the pitch used as the base for interval measurement, 12 half steps below/above it). This is equivalent to saying that the chromatic scale has 12 pitches with the octave being a repeat of the starting pitch.

== Consonance/Dissonance ==
Consonance is a measure of harmony or lack thereof. There are many definitions, some of which are subjective. In historic Europe, the augmented fourth/diminished fifth was said to be the &quot;Devil in music&quot;! In general, consonant intervals include the octave, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth.

== Sign Up For The GRE ==

The test can be signed up for by going to the GRE website at [http://www.gre.com GRE.com]. The test typically costs $160 or more to take each time. There are certain designated testing centers for taking the GRE, and if there isn't one close to your location, you may be in for a long drive.

The GRE may be retaken as many times as you wish, and only your highest score needs to be reported. However, you may only take the GRE once per calendar month, and you may only take the GRE up to 5 times per year. Each time you retake the GRE, you must pay the same registration fee. If you do poorly therefore, it is a good idea to take some time off (a month or two) to study the exam materials, improve your essay writing and typing, and become more familiar with the concepts covered on the exam. Do not waste your money by rushing back to take it immediately, because you will make the same mistakes. Research has shown that on the GRE, test scores do not improve dramatically for retests.

== The Test Format ==

There are two versions of the GRE test: the paper test and the computer test. People who live in the USA, US Territories, and Canada will take the computer test. The paper test is only reserved for geographic areas that have no computer or internet access. There is a 10 minute break provided if necessary, or you may choose to skip the break or end it prematurely.

The GRE has both a general test that all students take (with verbal, quantitative, and analytical writing sections), and optional subject tests that focus on particular subjects.  Subject tests are registered for separately. It is important to check with each individual school to determine which tests are required for admission to different programs. Some programs don't require you to take any subject tests, and some programs may require 2 or more subject tests to be considered for admission.

Unlike the SAT test, you are not penalized for providing an incorrect answer on the GRE general test. It is therefore not a good idea to ever leave a question blank on the test. If you do not know the answer to a particular question, eliminate some erroneous choices and make an educated guess.

As of August 1, 2011, ETS changed the format of the GRE. It is now a [[w:Multistage testing|multi-stage test]], or MST, and differs in some critical ways from the older versions.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan's New GRE Premier 2011-2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rather than the test adapting one question at a time, the test now adapts one section at a time.
* You can return to previous questions within a section.
* An on-screen calculator is provided for the Quantitative Reasoning sections.
* There are Mark &amp; Review buttons.
* Previously the test was scored on a scale from 200-800; however, the test is now scored on a scale from 130-170.
* The revised GRE is slightly longer, about 3 hours and 45 minutes.
* You get a one minute break between each section. The break is optional.
* You can sign up for the GRE just two days before the test (although, this is not recommended).
* The MST version of the revised GRE is offered all year long; however, you can only test every 21 days, up to a maximum of five times per rolling 12-month period (originally only once every 60 days).
* You don't have to take it on the same day as a subject test.
* It gives you your unofficial Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning scores immediately.

At any time during the test you may choose to leave the testing site. You will not get your money back so you may as well continue until the very end, even if you feel you are doing poorly. This way you can get a good understanding of the information that is on the GRE test, so you can better prepare for the next time you want to take it. Also, you may be doing much better than you think!

== Permitted Materials ==

You may not bring your own calculator to the GRE test; there is an on-screen calculator provided as of August 1, 2011. Pencils will be provided by the testing center, along with scrap paper (however, taking the paper-based test, scrap paper is not permitted, you'll be instructed to work out any problems within the available space in your workbooks). You may not bring pens, pencils of your own (mechanical pencils are expressly forbidden), additional paper, books, or other materials into the testing center.  

You may not have any form of food or drink in the testing area, though you can have access to this during your break or any time you leave while the time continues. You may also not bring in objects that can transmit or store voice or text, such as cell phones, pagers, PDAs, etc... 

The types of questions asked on the GRE are not generally conducive to cheating, so it is a waste of time to attempt to cheat on the test. Instead, use your time to study the relevant material, get good sleep, eat a healthy breakfast, and be prepared to do your best on the test.

=== Multiple Choice ===

Both the computer test and the paper test have multiple-choice sections. With the introduction of the MST on the revised GRE, you can move about freely in a section. You can even mark questions you are struggling with so that you can return to them later. When you've reached the end of the section, you can hit a &quot;Review&quot; button that informs you of any questions you have marked or not answered so that you can return to them. On the paper test, you are also free to go back and change answers as you see fit.

=== Essays ===

In the paper test, the analytical essays must be written on the paper provided by the testing center. Additional paper can be requested, if needed. On the computer test, the essay must be typed into the text-box provided on the computer. This textbox has some common computer commands available (cut and paste), but not other (no &quot;copy&quot; command, no spell check, no grammar check, etc...) features. The text editor does not accept the common Ctrl+X or Ctrl+V commands to cut and paste: these operations must be performed by clicking the specified buttons with your mouse.

== Scoring ==

The different sections are scored differently:

Sections:
*Quantitative: 130–170, in 1 point increments
*Verbal: 130-170 points, in 1 point increments
*Writing 0-6, in half point increments

In the computer test, the quantitative and verbal sections will be scored immediately, and your answers to those 2 sections will be provided before you leave the testing facility. The writing exam will be graded by 2 separate graders each. The writing scores are averaged together, and ''rounded up'' to the nearest half point. The writing scores will not be available immediately, but will instead be mailed to the address you provide within 6-8 weeks.

In the paper test, all 3 sections need to be mailed off and graded by hand, so all scores will be mailed to your given address in 6-8 weeks. Test-takers may call for scores five weeks after your paper test.

Scores on the paper test have been found to be equivalent to scores on the computer test, so this difference should not be an issue. Students who are better typists (faster and more accurate) are shown to score higher on the essay portions of the computer test, however. It is therefore a good idea to practice your typing skills before the test.

== Average Answers ==

Average scores for the verbal section are in the range of 400-500, although students with majors that are intensive in using language (such as humanities) score over 500 points on average. Students who are applying to graduate school in an area that requires language skills (humanities, social sciences, education) should score in this range or higher.

Average scores in the quantitative section are often between 500-600, although students in science and engineering are expected to score between 700-750 on average. Students who are applying to graduate school in areas that require math (for mathematics, science, engineering, and economics) should have scores in this range or higher.

Average scores for the analytical Writing section for all majors are usually between 4.0-5.0. This is a good target range for students of all majors.

== Experimental Sections ==

The format of the GRE leaves open the possibility of adding additional sections to the test, although these sections will not count towards your score. One experimental section of the test will be announced, and participation in it is optional (although high scores in these sections can be rewarded with monetary prizes). Another experimental section might be included, but it will be unannounced and will be either verbal or quantitative (no additional essays, luckily). Scores in either experimental section will not be counted towards your final score. These scores will also not be reported to your target institutions.

It is not a good idea to try and identify the unannounced experimental section. You should do your best work on every section of the GRE, even though some of your hard work may not count towards the final score.

= Quantitative section =
The quantitative section has 2 different types of questions: regular multiple-choice questions, and inequalities. The inequalities always use the following format:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Column A
! Column B
|-
| value
| value
|}
*you are given two columns with values, column A and column B. 
*you are to decide which column has the greater value.
*if column A is larger, select option A
*if column B is larger, select option B
*if the two are equal, select option C
*if there isn't enough information, select option D.

The paper test will have similar questions all in the same section, but the computer test will mix and match questions that it asks you. Make sure you read all the instructions for the question before answering.

Quantitative GRE questions will generally focus on subjects of geometry and algebra. Although a knowledge of trigonometry may be helpful for some problems that involve angles, circles, or triangles, it is not required. It is not necessary to know calculus or linear algebra to perform well on the quantitative section. It is important to note that unless it is explicitly stated in the question, you must assume that any images provided are not drawn to scale. It is therefore a bad idea to attempt to find an answer by graphical means. However, if you are an adept artist, you can attempt to draw your own figures to scale on the scrap paper, and attempt to find answers from those diagrams.

The verbal section is divided up into questions on sentence completion and analogies. In the antonym questions, a word is provided, and you must select the answer that is mostly the ''opposite'' of the given word. This is a very difficult concept for some people, so it is important to become familiar with it before taking the test.

Some people have said that it is &quot;impossible to study vocabulary&quot;, especially since the list of possible words that can appear on the test is gigantic. It does however help if you can study word roots, so that even if you don't know precisely what a word means, you can infer a general meaning from the way it is spelled. Remember, you should always answer every question, even if you have to guess. If you can make an informed guess based on the way the word is spelled, or the way it looks (good/bad, happy/angry, etc.), then you are giving yourself at least a small edge.

For GRE General Test happening after August 1st, 2011, ETS had implemented major change over in the exam's structure. Now in the verbal section of the revised GRE test, Antonyms and Analogies have been replaced by Reading comprehension. ETS believes that reading comprehension is superior to antonyms and other single-word questions as an assessment of verbal competence. More than half the revised GRE verbal section consists in paragraphs to read and questions based on those paragraphs.</text>

The analytical writing section is divided up into 2 essays: a critique and an opinion piece. Part of the score is determined by how well you separate your personal opinions from analytical arguments, and how well you stay on topic.

== The Opinion Essay: &quot;Present Your Perspective&quot; ==

The opinion essay provides you with two statements, one of which you must choose to answer. You are to give your personal opinion concerning the statement, agreeing with, disagreeing with, or qualifying the statement. You must not analyze the given statement, and you must not talk about other subjects. This is an important point, because this essay will be graded according to how well you stay on topic. If you don't stay on topic, you will lose points. Your skill in writing is not nearly as important as your ability to focus on the topic.

== The Critique Essay: &quot;Analyze an Argument&quot; ==

The critique essay provides you with an argument, often of dubious quality. Your task is to read the given passage, and analyze the logic of the assertion within the essay. You may accept or deny that the position presented is well-reasoned, but you must support this. (It is usually easier to find and discuss any logical flaws than to demonstrate that the brief argument is sound.) You must not use your personal opinions when writing this essay, and you must not speculate. You may only discuss the information that is provided, and you can comment on additional information that should be included. Again, your ability to follow the rules is much more important to the judges than your ability to write beautiful sentences. The opinion essay asks you to express your opinions and not critique the argument, while this essay asks you to do exactly the opposite. Check your emotions and opinions at the door, because if you start to express your opinions, you will lose points. The most difficult aspect of this essay is to separate the logical facts of the argument from your personal feelings on the issue. If you can separate these well, you will get a good score.

== Sample Essay Questions ==

The GRE website contains a large listing of sample essay questions.[https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/analytical_writing/issue/pool][https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/analytical_writing/argument/pool] It is a good idea to read through this list, and get a good idea of what kinds of things the GRE is going to ask. Do not bother trying to memorize this list of questions, or to prepare essays ahead of time, unless you are just practicing. The phrasing of the questions may vary enough from the list to affect any prepared answers.</text>

There are subject tests available in the following subjects:

*Biochemistry, Cell &amp; Molecular Biology
*Biology
*Chemistry
*Computer Science
*Literature in English
*Mathematics
*Physics
*Psychology

GRE subject tests are graded on a scale from 200 to 990, although the available score range for each test is usually smaller. Subject tests are graded independently, and therefore a score of 600 on the mathematics test is not equivalent to a 600 on the physics test. Subscores provided for certain subject tests are scored in the range of 20-99. 

Subject scores are calculated by taking the number of correct answers, minus 1 fourth the number of incorrect answers. It is therefore a good idea not to guess on the subject tests if you don't know the correct answer!

The subject tests slowly change over time to stay relevant. For this reason, subject test scores are comparable between years. for instance, a physics test score of 600 in 2005 is equivalent to a physics test score of 600 from 1999. The exception to this is the mathematics test that was rescaled in October 2001. Therefore, mathematics scores before and after October 2001 are not comparable directly.</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Prostate Cancer Screening and Prevention'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Screening==
'''''ASCO Clinical Opinion'''''
*'''2012''' PMID 22802323) -- &quot;Screening for prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen testing: american society of clinical oncology provisional clinical opinion.&quot; (Basch E, J Clin Oncol. 2012 Aug 20;30(24):3020-5. Epub 2012 Jul 16.)
**In men with a life expectancy &amp;le; 10 years ([http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/population/longevity.html Social Security Calculator]), it is recommended that general screening for prostate cancer with toalPSA be discouraged, because harms seem to outweigh potential benefits
**In men with a life expectancy &gt;10 years, it is recommended that physicians discuss with their patients whether PSA testing for prostate cancer screening is appropriate for them. PSA testing may save lives but is associated with harms, including complications from unnecessary biopsy, surgery or radiation treatment
**It is recommended that information written in lay language be available to clinicians and their patients to facilitate the discussion of the benefits and harms associated with PSA testing before the routine ordering of a PSA test


'''''Randomized'''''
*'''Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Screening Trial''' (1993-2001) -- screening vs usual care
**Randomized. 76,693 men at 10 U.S. centers. Arm 1) Annual PSA screening x6 years and DRE x4 years vs. Arm 2) usual care. Compliance in Arm 1 85% for PSA and 86% for DRE. Rate of control group screening (&quot;contamination&quot;): PSA screening 40-52% and DRE screening 41-46% by year
**'''2009''' PMID 19297565 -- &quot;Mortality results from a randomized prostate-cancer screening trial.&quot; (Andriole GL, N Engl J Med. 2009 Mar 26;360(13):1310-9. Epub 2009 Mar 18.)Median F/U 7 years
***Outcome: PCA incidence screening group 116/10,000 vs control group 95/10,000 (RR 1.1, SS). Death from PCA 2/10,000 vs 1.7/10,000 (RR 1.13, NS)
***Conclusion: After 7 years, rate of death from PCA is very low, and not different between groups
**'''2011''' PMID 21041707 -- &quot;Comorbidity and Mortality Results From a Randomized Prostate Cancer Screening Trial.&quot; (Crawford ED, J Clin Oncol.  2011 Feb 1;29(4):355-361 .)
***f/u 10 yrs. 9565 deaths, 164 from PCA. In men with no or minimal comorbidity, the decrease in PCA-specific mortality associated with screening was significant (22 v 38 deaths)(NNTT = 5 pts to prevent 1 death at 10 years). In men with at least 1 significant comorbidity, no decrease in PCSM with screening. (62 v 42 deaths; AHR=1.43; p=0.08).
***Conclusion: selective use of PSA screening in men with good health appears to reduce the risk of PCSM with minimal overtreatment.

*'''European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC)''' (1991-2003) -- screening vs no screening
**Randomized. 162,387 men, different enrollment strategies in different countries. Age 55-69. Arm 1) PSA screening (DRE and other studies per country; interval per country) vs. Arm 2) no screening. Treated with watchful waiting (15%), surgery (28%), RT (17%), RT+ADT (10%), ADT alone (10%)
**'''Lead Time Bias; 2003''' PMID 12813170 -- &quot;Lead times and overdetection due to prostate-specific antigen screening:estimates from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer. (Draisma G, J Natl Cancer Inst. 2003 Jun 18;95(12):868-78.)
***Model. 42,376 men enrolled at Rotterdam for ERSPC, with 1498 cases of PCA. 
***Outcome: Mean lead time bias depends on age at screening. At 55, mean lead time bias 12.3 years and overdetection rate of 27%. At 75, mean lead time bias 6.0 years and 56%. For a screening program with 4-year interval from age 55-67, estimated mean lead time 11.2 years with overdetection rate 48%. Lifetime prostate risk raised from 6% to 11% 
***Conclusion: Model-based lead-time estimates supports screening interval &gt;1 year
**'''9-years; 2009''' PMID 19297566 -- &quot;Screening and prostate-cancer mortality in a randomized European study.&quot; (Schroder FH, N Engl J Med. 2009 Mar 26;360(13):1320-8. Epub 2009 Mar 18.) Median F/U 9 years
***Outcome: PCA incidence screening 8% vs control 5%. Death from PCA 3.5/10,000 vs 4.1/10,000 (RR 0.8, SS), rates began to diverge after 8 years; absolute difference 0.07%. NNS 1410:1, NNT 48:1
***Conclusion: PSA-based screening reduced PCA death by 20%, but was associated with a high risk of overdiagnosis
**'''12-years; 2012''' '''(metastatic disease)''' PMID 22704366 [http://www.europeanurology.com/article/S0302-2838(12)00687-2/pdf/Screening+for+Prostate+Cancer+Decreases+the+Risk+of+Developing+Metastatic+Disease%3A+Findings+from+the+European+Randomized+Study+of+Screening+for+Prostate+Cancer+%28ERSPC%29 PDF] -- &quot;Screening for prostate cancer decreases the risk of developing metastatic disease: findings from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).&quot; (Schröder FH, Eur Urol. 2012 Nov;62(5):745-52.)
***M+ prostate cancer detected in 256 men screening group vs 410 controls; cumulative incidence of 0.67% vs 0.87% per 1000 men; relative reduction of 30% (intention to screen; 42% for those actually screened). Absolute risk reduction 3.1 per 1000 men screened (0.31%)
***Conclusion: &quot;PSA screening significantly reduces the risk of developing metastatic PCa.&quot;

*'''Quebec LUPCSP''' (1988) -- Screening vs control
**Randomized, 2:1. 46,486 men randomized, true screened 7,348 vs true unscreened 14,2341. Arm 1) annual screening (PSA and DRE) vs Arm 2) control
**'''2004''' PMID 15042607 -- &quot;Screening decreases prostate cancer mortality: 11-year follow-up of the 1988 Quebec prospective randomized controlled trial.&quot; (Labrie F, Prostate, 2004 May 15;59(3):311-8.). Median F/U 7.9 years
***Outcome: PCA death screened 0.1% vs. unscreened 0.5% (RR 0.4, SS)
***Conclusion: Screening showed a 62% reduction in cause-specific mortality, but the absolute benefit was small

'''''Case-control'''''

*'''Veterans Affairs; 2006''' PMID 16401808 &amp;mdash; &quot;The effectiveness of screening for prostate cancer: a nested case-control study.&quot; Concato J et al. Arch Intern Med. 2006 Jan 9;166(1):38-43.
**Case control study. 71,000 men in 10 VA hospitals. 501 pts dx with prostate cancer between 1991-95 and died by 1999. Compared with controls.
**No difference in rate of a screening PSA +/- DRE between cases (14%) and controls (13%)
**Conclusion: screen does not reduce mortality

==Prevention==
*'''REDUCE Trial''' -- dutasteride vs placebo
**Randomized. 6729 men, at increased risk for prostate cancer (50-75 years old, PSA 2.5-10.0, one negative biopsy within 6 months). Arm 1) dutasteride 0.5 mg vs Arm 2) placebo. Primary endpoint: PCA on biopsy at 2 and 4 years
**'''2010''' PMID 20357281 -- &quot;Effect of dutasteride on the risk of prostate cancer.&quot; (Andriole GL,N Engl J Med. 2010 Apr 1;362(13):1192-202.)
***Outcome: incidence of cancer dutasteride 20% vs placebo 25% (SS, risk reduction 28%). No difference in GS 7-10; less GS 8-10 in dutasteride group. But during years 3 &amp; 4, 12 tumors GS 8-10 the dutasteride group, only 1 in placebo group (SS).
***Toxicity: dutasteride improved acute urinary retention (2% vs 7%, SS), but had higher cardiac failure (0.7% vs 0.4%, SS)
***Conclusion: Dutasteride reduced risk of prostate cancer and improved BPH symptoms

*'''SELECT Trial''' (2001-4) - Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial
**35,533 men, multinational North American (US, Canada, Puerto Rico) - enrolled men 55 yrs or older (or 50 if African American), no prior prostate cancer, PSA &lt; 4, negative DRE. Randomized to selenium (200 µg/d from L-selenomethionine), vs vitamin E (400 IU/d), or both; placebo-controlled. F/U every 6 months; recommended annual PSA and DRE. Pt self-reported prostate cancer events.
**Median age 62. 
**PMID 19066370, 2009 -- &quot;Effect of selenium and vitamin E on risk of prostate cancer and other cancers: the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT).&quot; (Lippman SM, JAMA. 2009 Jan 7;301(1):39-51.)
***Median f/u 5.5 yrs. No difference in rate of prostate cancer: 5 yr rate 4.43% (placebo), 4.56% (Se), 4.93% (E), 4.56% (Se+E).
**Conclusion: Selenium,  vitamin E, or both (at the tested doses and formulations) did not prevent prostate cancer

*'''Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial''' (1994-1997)
**18,882 men, multicenter - enrolled men age 55 or older with normal DRE, PSA &lt; 3.0, no medical comorbidities, and AUA score &lt; 20. Randomized to finasteride 5 mg/day vs placebo x 7 yrs (planned). Pts followed with annual DRE and annual PSA. Planned end of study biopsy (min. 6 cores). Biopsy also recommended if abnormal DRE or PSA &gt; 4.
**PSA values were adjusted for men in finasteride group (initially, adjusted PSA = 2.0 x PSA, but changed to 2.3 at man's fourth year); this was done to ensure a biopsy rate that is approximately equal between the groups.
**PMID 12824459, 2003 &amp;mdash; &quot;The influence of finasteride on the development of prostate cancer.&quot; Thompson IM et al. N Engl J Med. 2003 Jul 17;349(3):215-24.
***Study terminated early in 2003, 15 months before planned end of trial, due to study objective being met. 
***Analysis based on 86.3% of pts who completed 7 yrs by the termination date. Prostate cancer status known (i.e. end of study biopsy completed or interval prostate cancer diagnosis) in 9989 pts (59.6% fin, 63.0% placebo). 9060 pts included in final analysis (excluding pts who had end of study biopsy performed late).  
***Rate of prostate cancer diagnosis: 803(18.4%) F vs 1147(24.4%) P; risk reduction of 24.8%. 45-50% of prostate cancer was diagnosed at end of study biopsy rather than for increased PSA. High grade (Gleason score 7-10) in 280 of 757 graded tumors (37%) of F vs 237 of 1068 (22.2%) of P; RR = 1.67 for high grade. 
***Treatment temporarily discontinued due to side effects in 18.3% of men in F group (vs 9.9% for P).
**Conclusion: Lowers the risk of prostate cancer by 24.8%. However, the finasteride group developed an increased proportion of patients with high grade tumors (Gleason 7-10).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FOSS Network Infrastructure and Security}}
Whenever I’m asked why Free/Open Source Software ([[w:FOSS|FOSS]]) is so important, I recount the story of Xanadu. Mind you, that’s not story of the mythical Xanadu, the opulent 13th century summer capital of the Kublai(grandson of Genghis) Khan’s empire that spanned all of Asia. I mean the software vision of Ted Nelson, a genius of the 1960s. That Xanadu is widely acknowledged as the inspiration behind the concept of hypertext, Apple’s original Hypercard and the World Wide Web.

Although its original concept stemmed from technology rather than a business model, it is the latter that probably resulted in its demise. That’s because Xanadu tried to become that era’s digital rights management scheme; a toll-bridge solution. Each time someone clicked on a hyper link, a 2-cent charge would credit that person’s account with a small percentage going to Xanadu. For nearly 25 years, between four and ten scientists worked on some aspect of the project. In the late 1980s, Dave Walker, the CEO of AutoDesk, bought into the vision and plowed through about US$ 24 million trying to make Xanadu a shippable product.

But others had a simpler and clearer vision. Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at the European research centre CERN in Geneva, working with a few collaborators, engineered a completely new competing distributed hypertext system that became the World Wide Web. Tim lobbied and fought with board members at CERN who wanted to control and license the WWW technology to the rest of the world. He emerged victorious and an open standard became the standard. Tim Berners-Lee correctly realized that the value of his making an open contribution of his invention was far more important to humanity than any possible value CERN could bring with stewardship. The rest of the story is, as they say, history and represents the ultimate example of how FOSS has the power to radically change our world.

During the negotiations leading to the first and second phases of the World Summit on the Information Society, there was a growing realization of many government policy makers, particularly those from developing economies, of how FOSS was an important tool to promote digital literacy and improve access to public services for their citizens. But thought leaders are now beginning to realize that the FOSS movement is but one manifestation of something more fundamental and new about how collective intellectual innovation can blossom once networked information infrastructures are in place. In Yale academic Yochai Benkler’s new book, The Wealth of Networks, he notes:

“The change brought about by the networked information environment is deep. It is structural. It goes to the very foundations of how liberal markets and liberal democracies have co-evolved for almost two centuries…A series of changes in the technologies, economic organization, and social practices of production in this environment has created new opportunities for how we make and exchange
information, knowledge, and culture. These changes have increased the role of non-market and non-proprietary production, both by individuals alone and by cooperative efforts in a wide range of loosely or tightly woven collaborations.”

We should applaud the efforts of the Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme and the International Open Source Network ([[w:IOSN|IOSN]]) for their promotion activities of FOSS. This FOSS e-Primer on Network Infrastructure and Security is one of series of simple ‘how-to’ guidebooks they have produced for the lay person.

A globally interconnected information network makes it clear that cyber security is a responsibility of all countries worldwide. But even in developed countries, trained cyber security professionals are lacking so developing economies are at a huge disadvantage. Lacking in resources and with few incentives, it can be argued that developing countries represent the weakest link in promoting global cyber security. This means we need to make special efforts to assist developing economies in adopting the “technology, processes and people” of cyber security. This book represents an excellent contribution toward that laudable goal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Е/Ё Assimilation (Yakannie)==
Яканне &quot;yakannie&quot; (saying ''я'') is a process similar to akannie. It is also related to stress shifting. The rule for yakannie is as follows.

The vowels ''е'' and ''ё'' are not normally used in the pretonic syllable. The ''я'' letter is used instead of them in such a position.

'''вёска''' &quot;vioska&quot; a village - '''вяско́вы''' &quot;viaskovy&quot; village (adjective)

In all other unstressed syllables, other than pretonic, ''е'' is preserved.

'''зямля́''' &quot;ziamlia&quot; land - '''зе́млі''' &quot;ziemli&quot; lands - '''землятру́с''' &quot;ziemliatrus&quot; an earthquake.

In the last word, the ''е'' letter is used instead of ''я'' because it is not the pretonic, though unstressed, syllable.

==Negation==

The word ''не'' is used to form negative statements. You should place it before the word being negated.

'''Гэ́та не студэ́нт. Гэ́та выкла́дчык.''' This is not a student. This is a lecturer.

'''Я не хво́ры.''' I am not ill.

'''Не я хво́ры.''' This is not I who is ill.

Take care that ''не'' is pronounced like ''ня'' if the next word's first syllable is stressed (and thus ''не'' becomes pretonic). In tarashkievitsa, in such cases ''ня'' is written instead of ''не''. E.g. the latter two sentences in tarashkievitsa would look like ''Я ня хворы'' and ''Ня я хворы''.

With qualitative adjectives, ''не'' is often used as a prefix, forming an adjective with an opposite meaning (like the English ''un'' prefix).

'''вялікі''' big - '''невялікі''' not big

'''прыго́жы''' beautiful - '''непрыго́жы''' not beautiful

'''зру́чны''' comfortable, handy - '''нязру́чны''' uncomfortable

Take note that being a prefix ''не'' may transform to ''ня'' if gets into a pretonic position.

==Saying Yes or No==

To ask a general question, i.e. a question requiring the answer ''yes'' or ''no'', in Belarusian, you need to put a question mark (?) at the end of the sentence (in writing) or use interrogative intonation (in oral speech). No special word order is required.

To answer a general question, the words ''так'' (yes) or ''не'' (no) can be used.

'''Гэ́та саба́ка? - Так, гэ́та саба́ка.''' Is this a dog? Yes, it is a dog.

'''Ты хво́ры? - Не, я не хво́ры. Я здаро́вы.''' Are you ill? No, I am not ill. I am well.

Note the difference between Belarusian ''так'' and English ''yes'' when answering questions containing negation.

'''Гэ́та не саро́ка? - Так, гэ́та не саро́ка. Гэ́та варо́на.''' This is not a magpie, is it? No, it is not. It is a crow.

Thus, saying ''так'' means agreeing with what is asked in the question. If the question is negative, the ''так'' answer confirms negation.

The ''не'' answer can mean both negation and disagreement, and it is ambiguous when answering negative questions (''no, you are not right'' or ''no, it is not so''). So, some extra information is needed in such cases.

'''Гэ́та не но́вая кніга?''' - '''Так, гэ́та не но́вая кніга.''' or '''Не, гэ́та не но́вая кніга.''' Is this book not new? No, it is not new.

==Demonstratives==

Along with the demonstrative pronoun ''гэта'' there exists a demonstrative determiner ''гэты'' which is coordinated with the noun by number and gender (like adjectives).

'''Гэ́ты го́рад вялікі.''' This city is big.

'''Гэ́тае мо́ра прыго́жае.''' This sea is beautiful.

'''Гэ́тая вёска стара́я.''' This village is old.

'''Гэ́тыя ву́ліцы шы́рокія.''' These streets are broad.

Note the difference between ''гэты'' and ''гэта'':

'''Гэ́та но́вы трамва́й.''' This is a new tram.

'''Гэ́ты трамва́й но́вы.''' This tram is new.

The word ''той'' corresponds to the English ''that'' determiner.

'''Той саба́ка стары́.''' That dog is old.

'''То́е дрэ́ва высо́кае.''' That tree is high.

'''Та́я рака́ ву́зкая.''' That river is narrow.

'''Ты́я шко́лы но́выя.''' Those schools are new.

''Тое'' can also be used as a pronoun. But it is not used as a demonstrative: ''гэта'' is used instead, both with close and distant objects. Thus, ''Гэта хата'' may mean ''This is a house'' or ''That is a house''.

== Free/Open Source Software ==
Free/Open Source Software, or FOSS, is software that is liberally licensed to grant users the right to study, change and improve its design since its source code is made available.
The definition of free software, as enunciated by the Free Software Foundation, states that four essential freedoms should be contained within its license:

1. The freedom to run the program for any purpose;

2. The freedom to study and modify the program;

3. The freedom to copy the program so you can help your neighbour, and

4. The freedom to improve the program and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits.

Freedoms 2 and 4 require access to the source because studying and modifying software without source
code &lt;ref&gt; Code written by a programmer in a high-level language and readable by people but not computers. Source code must be converted to object code or machine language before a computer can read or execute the program.&lt;/ref&gt; is extremely difficult and highly inefficient since humans cannot usually understand machine code or object code. The Open Source definition published by the Open Source Initiative states that:

1. The license should not prohibit free redistribution;

2. The program must include source code and must allow distribution in source code as well as
compiled form;

3. The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed
under the same terms as the license of the original software;

4. The integrity of the author’s source code and reputation must be maintained by requiring derived
works to carry a different name or version number from the original software;

5. The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons;

6. The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of
endeavour;

7. The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed,
without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties;

8. The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program being part of a particular
software distribution;

9. The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed
software; and

10. No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.

Some examples of FOSS software include: the Linux kernel, GNOME Desktop and Free Berkeley Software
Distribution (FreeBSD). The most well known and popular FOSS licenses include: GNU General Public License (GPL), GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), BSD license, Apache License, MIT License and
Mozilla Public License. For more information on FOSS, please refer to FOSS: A General Introduction by
Kenneth Wong and Phet Sayo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iosn.net/foss/foss-general-primer/foss_primer_current.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== GNU/Linux ==
GNU/Linux (also known as Linux) is a computer operating system. It is one of the most prominent examples of FOSS development. Initially, GNU/Linux was primarily developed and used by individual enthusiasts. Since then, GNU/Linux has gained the support of major corporations such as IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Novell for use in servers and is becoming popular in the desktop market. Proponents and analysts attribute this success to its vendor independence, low cost, security, and reliability.

In 1983, Richard Stallman founded the GNU Project. The goal of GNU was to develop a complete Unix-like operating system composed entirely of free software. By the beginning of the 1990s, GNU had produced or collected most of the necessary components – libraries, compilers, text editors, a Unix-like shell – except for the lowest level, the kernel. The GNU project began developing its own kernel, the Hurd, in 1990, based on the Mach micro-kernel. This Mach-based design subsequently proved difficult, however, and development proceeded slowly.

Meanwhile, in 1991, another kernel was begun as a hobby by Finnish university student Linus Torvalds while attending the University of Helsinki. Linux was further developed by various programmers over the Internet. In 1992, it was combined with the GNU system, resulting in a fully functional free operating system. The GNU system is most commonly encountered in this form, usually referred to as a ‘GNU/Linux system’ or a ‘Linux distribution’. This is by far the most popular variant of GNU. There are over 300 distributions based on GNU with the Linux kernel. Some of the most widely used are: Debian, Gentoo, Mandriva, Red Hat Linux, Slackware, SuSE and Ubuntu.

The Linux kernel was originally envisioned to be used on Intel 80386-based machines. While not originally intended to be portable to other architectures, Linux is now one of the most widely ported operating systems in the world, running on a diverse range of systems from the iPAQ to IBM System z9. Specialized distributions exist for less mainstream architectures. Linux is increasingly common as an operating system for supercomputers. In November 2005, the Top 500 List of supercomputers stated that the two fastest supercomputers in the world run Linux. Of the 500 systems, 74 percent run some version of Linux, including seven of the top 10.

The Linux kernel and most GNU components are licensed under the GNU GPL. The GPL requires that all source code modifications and derived works also be licensed under the GPL, and is sometimes referred to as a “share and share-alike” (or copyleft) license.

== Network Operator’s Perspective on FOSS ==
All network operators need to provide a set of services for which they need reliable systems. Services such as web surfing, e-mail and Domain Name System (DNS) form the backbone of all network providers. Network operators also need scalability as the number of users grows, since they usually operate in a high volume business. This requires a reliable system which can be scaled up quickly and which can run services efficiently.

FOSS provides several advantages over proprietary software in terms of savings with regard to license fees, flexibility in installation and operation, and availability of source code that can act as reference implementations for the basic building blocks of Internet infrastructure. FOSS also reduces virus and security problems frequently associated with other software because of the possibility of public audit of source code. Finally, illegal copying of software is an increasing concern worldwide, and using FOSS ensures that you are always on the side of the law.

== GNU/Linux for Networking ==
While there are other operating systems, like *BSD, and those that also provide access to source code, GNU/Linux is the most popular FOSS system in the world. From a networking perspective, the UNIX operating system is the pioneer in multi-user systems. UNIX and UNIX clones such as *BSD and GNU/Linux have been developed with network performance and
security in mind.

In the past, most network systems relied on expensive hardware and proprietary UNIX platforms to get
maximum benefits. With GNU/Linux, the same kind of benefits can be achieved on cheaper hardware. At
the same time, the availability of the source code enables operators to create their own extensions and fine-tune the software to their own needs.

Also, most servers and programs that are required for network operations are available on GNU/Linux,
and a lot of additional utilities are being developed constantly to provide added advantages.

== BSD Alternatives ==
While GNU/Linux has received wide recognition in the past few years, there are alternative open source operating systems, mainly the different types of BSD: NetBSD, FreeBSD and OpenBSD. The BSD license is one of the most widely used licenses for FOSS. Many software programs are released under this license, including Apache and Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND). This license has few restrictions when compared to licenses such as the GNU GPL, and especially the default restrictions provided by copyright, putting it relatively closer to the public domain. Therefore, while preserving open access to the source code, the BSD license also allows the software to be used in proprietary software and products.

== Computer Networks ==
A network is a mechanism that enables distributed computers and users to communicate and share resources. Sharing of resources may mean sharing a printer, a scanner or even a large hard disk on a particular computer. A computer network connects two or more computers or peripherals so that all users on the network have access to these resources.

There are two major types of computer networks:

*Server-based networks; and

*Peer-to-peer networks.

In a '''server-based network''', there exists one or more computer(s) on which the resources are centralized. The network is also more or less controlled by the server. Servers generally have superior processing power, memory and hard disk space compared to desktop systems.

In a '''peer-to-peer network''', all computers on the network are responsible for sharing resources. Each computer shares the resources that it has. All computers are servers as well as clients. There is no central control over the resources. Peer-to-peer networks are based on peer relationships among computers in the network.

== Network Topology ==
Topology refers to the arrangement of computers in a network. In physical terms, there are two main topologies that are commonly used: 

* Bus topology; and

* Star topology

The simplest arrangement is '''Bus topology''' in which all computers are connected in a series to a single stretch of cable. This means that the entire length of the cable must be intact for the network to work properly; which makes larger networks prone to failure.

A hub or a switch is used as the central exchange point in a Star topology. All computers are connected to the hub in a star-like configuration of wires going in all directions from the hub. A '''Star topology''' is easier to maintain and to expand.

== LAN Architecture ==
Two computers can communicate in different ways through different Local Area Network (LAN) architectures. Of the two well-known architectures — Ethernet and Token Ring — the former is more popular.

=== Ethernet ===
Ethernet is independent of any vendor, which accounts for its great success. Basic Ethernet architecture operates at a speed of 10 Mbps (mega bits per second). Other variations include Fast Ethernet, operating at 100 Mbps, and Gigabit Ethernet operating at 1 Giga bit per second. The Ethernet standards are referred to in the 802.nn notation, an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard. WiFi (wireless fidelity) networks also follow the same standards, and are thus characterized as 802.11x.

=== Token Ring ===
Token-Ring LAN technology was developed and promoted by IBM in the early 1980s and was later standardized as IEEE 802.5. Initially very successful, its popularity went into steep decline after the introduction of the 10 Mbps Ethernet standard in the early 1990s.

== Network Hardware ==
=== Network Cabling ===
Cables play a fundamental role in any network, and exist at the most primary level of the network. Two types of cables are in common use – co-axial cables (similar to cable TV cables) and twisted pair cables (similar to telephone cables). Co-axial cables are generally used with T-connectors in a Bus topology network. Twisted pair cables are used mostly in Hub-based networks.

=== Network Adapter Cards ===
Network Interface Cards (NICs) or Network Adapter Cards, as they are commonly known, provide an interface on the computer to connect to the network cable. Today, most computers come with a built-in network card. However, if it is not built into the system, an additional card can be inserted inside the computer, which will then connect to the network cable.

== Networks Operation and Layers ==
Computer networks operate at different layers, each of which is independent of the others. The layers are stacked on top of each other, with each layer providing service to the layer above it. Network layers, as these layers are commonly known, provide general understanding of any computer network. A very simple form of these layers is illustrated below.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| Internet Protocol
| Network Layer
|-
| rowspan=2 | Hardware Layer 
| Network Interface Card Drivers
| Software/Hardware Layer
|-
| Network Interface Card Layer
| Electronic Layer
|}

=== NIC Driver ===
An NIC driver provides a layer between the hardware and the software in any network. All network card manufacturers provide NIC drivers, which sometimes also come with the operating system.

=== Network Protocols ===
Network protocols provide a way for diverse computer hardware to communicate with each other in a standard way. These protocols follow set rules unique to themselves. Common network protocols are IP (commonly referred to as the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol or TCP/IP) and NetBEUI (NetBIOS Extended User Interface). Other protocols had been developed and used in the past, but IP has replaced most of these. NetBEUI is developed by Microsoft and is native to the Windows environment. IP is the Internet Protocol and is the most popular protocol today.

=== TCP/IP === 
TCP/IP are the basic protocols of the Internet. There are other protocols in TCP/IP like User Datagram Protocol (UDP). IP is the network layer and provides the basis for the network through the IP addresses. The IP address of each computer must be unique. TCP and UDP are the transport layers and are responsible for transport of network data packets.

IP addresses follow the format nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn (where nnn is any number from 0 to 255 including 0 and 255). A network mask separates
the network address and the host address.

For internal network use, the IP range defined in Request For Comments (RFC) &lt;ref&gt;RFC stands for Request for Comments, which is the series of documentation for Internet Standards. RFC 1918 means RFC number 1918, which defines private use IP addresses. RFCs can be downloaded from http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/. We will refer to many RFCs for further reference throughout the e-primer.&lt;/ref&gt; 19184&lt;ref&gt;RFC 1918. ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1918.txt&lt;/ref&gt; should be used. These are 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255, 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 and 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255

== Components of a Network ==
=== Network Operating System ===
A Network Operating System (NOS) is a network capable operating system that handles network resources
and provides services like file and printer sharing. It is also capable of being an application server.

=== Users and Groups ===
Any NOS provides some form of security to its resources and services, the simplest being the user name &amp; password pair. All users on the network are given a unique user name and they are also given a secret password. Only after verifying that a proper user name and password have been supplied does the NOS provide access to the designated network services.

A group is a collection of users in any network. A group is created to give similar rights to a group of users. Groups make administration and management easier.

=== Rights ===
Not all resources in a network may be available to everyone. It is necessary to shield some parts of the network from unauthorized use. So, all NOS provide rights to its users and groups. Users and groups are given only the required rights, while the more powerful rights are limited to the administrators.

=== Super User or Administrator === 
In most NOS, there is a super user or administrator who has absolute rights in the network system. In the UNIX and GNU/Linux environments, ‘root’ is the super user. An administrator is the supreme user in a Windows network. In NetWare networks, supervisors are super, meaning such users are capable of doing anything that the NOS permits. These accounts should be used with care.

== Monitoring Network Performance ==
When users start complaining that the network is too slow, we know that there are problems in the
network. Network performance must be monitored to find where the fault lies. It may lie in the network hardware or software.

Inferior grade cables and loose cable connections cause 80 percent of network problems and performance issues. High quality and prescribed cables and connectors should always be used. Another cause of problems may be the server hardware. Servers require more Random Access Memory (RAM). Some
network performance problems call for the replacement of an older switch.

Unnecessary services running on the server should be stopped to get the maximum performance from
the server. Every NOS provides some utility to monitor network performance, as well as server
performance.

== Troubleshooting the Network ==
The first step is to check the cables. After that, check the power connections to the network switch or resources on the network. If the problem is not solved, check the different services running on the server.

== Role of FOSS in Networking ==
The Internet is the biggest example of the successful implementation of free and open source tools and software. It is the largest network in the world and its basis is the IP protocol. While it is true that the Internet has helped in the growth of FOSS in general, FOSS has also made the Internet a much more reliable network. Detailed information about the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the protocol standards body of the Internet, and its implications as a FOSS reference implementation can be found in RFC 1718.

== Limitations to the Use of FOSS ==
Yes, there are limitations. Most FOSS is produced in conformance to open standards and processes. There are proprietary software and processes that may not have a FOSS equivalent. Sometimes, it may also be necessary to use proprietary software to access certain types of hardware. Another limitation may be the rapid pace of development of FOSS. To an average user, this may be confusing but for service providers this is definitely an advantage.

== Domain Name System ==
DNS is the glue that keeps the technical side of the Internet connected to the users of the network.
Simply stated, the DNS provides names to IP address translation and vice versa. The Internet is based on the IP protocol, which means that computers on the Internet know the path to each other only through the IP addresses. However, remembering the numerical IP address of each computer on the Internet is not possible for most people. Here is where DNS comes in handy.

The main purpose of DNS is to map names to objects on the Internet. The object may be an IP address or the identification of mail servers, name servers, and even personal telephone numbers. Names, after all, are easier to remember than numbers.

The earlier version of DNS was a file named hosts.txt, which was manually maintained by the Stanford
Research Institute-Network Information Center (SRI-NIC) in the early days of the ARPANET&lt;ref&gt;Advanced Research Program Agency Network is considered the precursor to the current Internet.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1970s. This hosts.txt file was updated on a single computer and pulled by computers all over the world. While this method worked for some time, name collision became imminent when more hosts were added to the network. The flat single file mapping was simply not scalable. Thus DNS was created. It is defined in RFC 1034 and 1035.

DNS consists of three components:

* DNS name space – the domain names;
* DNS server – the server that hosts the name space; and
* Resolver – the client which uses the server.

The three components work in tandem to create a viable solution to name resolution. DNS is designed in such a way that all the data are maintained locally but retrievable globally. The data is distributed among different name servers and no single computer has all of the data. The data is internally always consistent, thereby providing a stable system. Moreover, DNS is designed in such a way that any device can send DNS queries to a server.

=== DNS Name Space ===
DNS name space is a concept. Names are references to addresses, objects and physical presences that
constitute a human, understandable reference identifying an endpoint. DNS name space is the name
space defined for DNS. On the Internet, domain names provide a hierarchy for DNS name space, and thus, an order to how Internet addresses are identified. 

Let’s take a comparative example. If someone were to send me a letter, it would be addressed to 

:Gaurab Raj Upadhaya

:205/8 Sahayogi Marg, Kathmandu, Nepal

In this example, the address provides a way in which the letter can be sent to me from anywhere in the world. Similarly, if someone were to send me an e-mail, they could use either of the following e-mail addresses:

:gaurab@wlink.com.np

:gaurab@lahai.com

In both cases, while the e-mail ends up in the same mailbox, it travels differently to that address. What needs to be understood is the domain hierarchy that makes the e-mail work. It is part of the DNS name space. Domain names are the implementation of DNS name space. The domain name system uses an
inverted tree-shaped structure. The topmost level of the DNS tree is called the ‘root’.&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with the ‘root’ user on GNU/Linux and Unix systems.&lt;/ref&gt; The ‘root’ is referenced with a ‘ . ’ (dot). Immediately below the ‘root’ are the Country Code Top Level Domain (ccTLD) and the Global Top Level Domain (gTLD). These two top levels are predefined and fixed on a global scale. The ccTLDs are assigned as per the ISO 3166 standard. The gTLDs are decided by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Name and Numbers (ICANN). Examples of ccTLDs are .np, .in, .my, .uk, .se, etc. ccTLDs are always two letter codes. Examples of gTLDs are .com, .org, .net, .gov, .edu, .mil, .info, .name, and .aero.

=== Domains and Sub Domains ===
Below the TLDs are the user level spaces. These are commonly referred to as the domain names. For
example, anything under .net is in the net domain, and anything under .uk is under the UK domain. And
by extension, a sub domain under lahai.com, such as evo.lahai.com, is under the lahai.com domain.

Every domain created under an upper level domain is referred to as a sub domain. Thus, in the example
above, evo.lahai.com is a sub domain under lahai.com. 

=== Zones and Delegation ===
In computer terms, each DNS name space is reflected by its zone file. It is also referred to as the
‘administrative name space’. Each domain or sub domain on a name server has its own zone file, which is the main file that provides the mapping. 

What makes DNS so scalable is its ability to define a delegation for sub domains to other servers and other zone files. Thus, the root zone file delegates ccTLD and gTLD functions to their respective servers, and each ccTLD or gTLD server further delegates specific domain information to their registered owners. Thus, the actual names to object mapping will be provided only by the authoritative zone for that domain. This procedure can be compared to a parent delegating authority to their child.

== Name Servers ==
Name servers host the DNS zone files. They answer queries directed to them. Name servers are of two types.

# Authoritative name servers
#* master
#* slave
# Non-authoritative name servers
#* caching name servers
#* caching forwarders

Most implementations are a combination of two or more types.

=== Authoritative Name Servers ===
Authoritative name servers host the main zone files for the designated domain. The authority of the
name server is based on delegation from the upper level domain. Thus for any server to be authoritative for evo.lahai.com domain, it has to be delegated in the lahai.com zone file.

The master file is where the main file is hosted. The slave mirrors the file from the master. There can be multiple slave servers to one master server. A single master server can support more than 20 million names, but it might not be a good idea to actually do this. Different DNS server software are capable of handling large numbers of DNS queries. A commonly cited example is 300,000 queries per second. Changes in the master copy of the database are replicated to the slaves immediately or according to timing set by the administrator.

=== Recursive Name Server ===
A recursive name server is not authoritative for all domains for which it is serving data. It acts on behalf of other clients, and caches the result in its memory. If the same query is sent within a predefined time period, then instead of searching the entire DNS structure, it serves the data from the cache. In case of caching forwarders, the server uses another DNS server to get the result. When the data are forwarded to the client, they are marked as non-authoritative.

=== Mixed Implementation ===
In smaller organizations, a single name server can be used for multiple purposes. A server can be
authoritative for a select few domains but it may also serve as a non-authoritative caching server for other domains. With recent cases of DNS cache poisoning, it is strongly recommended that the same
server not be used for both authoritative and caching functions.

=== Resolver ===
The resolver is the client that asks the server for the DNS data. The resolver is normally implemented at the operating system level in the form of a library, so that multiple applications can use it.

== DNS Security ==
A big strength of the Internet is in the user’s ability to use names to reach the right servers and systems. A mis-configured DNS or a malformed DNS query can deter users; hence, the need for a secure DNS system. It is very important to follow these simple points:
* Allow only authorized systems to do zone transfers from the master server.
* Have a minimum of two DNS servers, and remember not to put them in the same location.
* Make sure that your forward and reverse DNS information is consistent.
* Follow current best practices for DNS implementation.

== Using BIND for DNS ==
BIND is an implementation of the DNS protocols. It provides an openly re-distributable reference
implementation of the major components of the domain name system, including:
* A DNS server (named);
* A DNS resolver library; and
* Tools for verifying the proper operation of the DNS server.
The BIND DNS server is used on the vast majority of name serving machines on the Internet, as it provides a robust and stable architecture on top of which an organization’s naming architecture can be built. The resolver library included in the BIND distribution provides the standard interface for translation between domain names and Internet addresses and is intended for linking with applications requiring name service.

=== Getting and Installing BIND ===
BIND is normally installed by default by most GNU/Linux distributions. Otherwise, you can always get a copy from the BIND home page at http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/. The installation process of BIND
in different distributions of GNU/Linux may differ. It is best to follow the distribution guide for installation.

=== Configuration of BIND ===
The BIND configuration has to be undertaken in three stages.

First, the client side or the resolver library needs to be configured, followed by the server itself and finally, the tools.

==== Resolver configuration ====
The resolver is the client side of the DNS system. Even if you do not run a DNS sever on the computer, you will need to have the resolver installed. Naturally, in order to configure BIND, you first need to configure the resolver library. This is done by configuration of the following files:

:&lt;tt&gt;/etc/host.conf&lt;/tt&gt;

This file specifies how the host name resolution is performed. This has been made obsolete, but older
installations may still use it.

:&lt;tt&gt;/etc/nsswitch.conf&lt;/tt&gt;

This file has replaced host.conf. It specifies the order in which name resolution takes place. It tells the computer the order in which it should try to convert names into IP addresses.

:&lt;tt&gt;# /etc/nsswitch.conf&lt;/tt&gt;

Any line starting with a # sign is a comment.

'#' In this example, hosts are resolved through DNS, and then from files.

:&lt;tt&gt;hosts: dns files&lt;/tt&gt;

'#' only files are used for network name resolution

:&lt;tt&gt;networks: files&lt;/tt&gt;

The default file created during installation is usually sufficient.

:&lt;tt&gt;/etc/resolv.conf&lt;/tt&gt;

resolv.conf is the basic DNS configuration file, which specifies the DNS server and the domain name. The three key words here are ‘domain’, ‘search’, and ‘nameserver’.

:&lt;tt&gt;# /etc/resolv.conf&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# Our domain&lt;/tt&gt;
:domain gaurab.org.np&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# Default search domains in order of priority
:search gaurab.org.np lahai.com.np&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# We use the local server as the first name server.
:nameserver 127.0.0.1&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# we have second name server at up stream provider.
:nameserver 206.220.231.1&lt;/tt&gt;

This file is also created during the installation, and if your network configurations have not changed, you can leave it unchanged.

==== Server configuration ====
‘'''named'''’ is the best known FOSS DNS daemon. A daemon is a software program that runs continuously on the server as a service. The DNS server is thus commonly referred to as the ‘name daemon’ or just ‘named’. The file name of the DNS server is also ‘named’.

For BIND versions 4.x.x, named used the configuration file/etc/named.boot. But in the later versions of BIND (8.x.x), the configuration file is /etc/named.conf.

For our purposes, we use /etc/named.conf. In the following example, a master DNS for the domains
lahai.com and gaurab.org.np is specified. A slave DNS for domain wlink.com.np is also shown.

:&lt;tt&gt;//
:// /etc/named.conf file for ns.lahai.com
:// in this file ‘//’ is the comment.

:// you specify the default data directory for DNS. Now all DNS
:// related files should go into /var/named or any other
:// directory as specified.

:options {
:directory “/var/named”;
:};

:// First you need to add the DNS root zone file name. It’s there
:// by default.

:zone “.” {
:type hint;
:file “named.ca”;
:};

:// Now we are specifying a master domain called lahai.com
:// whose information is stored in the file ‘named.lahai.com’

:zone “lahai.com” {
:type master;
:file «named.lahai.com»;
:};

:// the whole thing can also be done in a single line.

:zone “gaurab.org.np” { type master; file “named.gaurab.org.np”;};

:// Now this server is also a slave for another domain “wlink.com.np’

:zone “wlink.com.np” { type slave; masters { 202.79.32.33; };
:file “slave/named.wlink.com.np”; };

:zone “0.0.127.in-addr.arpa” { type master; file “named.local”; }&lt;/tt&gt;

This file sets the stage for adding the real data about host name and IP addresses. The /etc/named.conf file can take a lot of additional configuration directives, but these will not be discussed here.

After relevant entries have been made in the named.conf file, it is necessary to create the host name
records for the corresponding domains. All of the files should be placed in the directory specified by the directory directive in the named.conf file.

The '''named.local''' file provides reverse zone lookup for the loopback interface or the 127.0.0.0 network used by the loopback addresses. The default file should be left unchanged. The '''named.ca''' provides the root server information to the DNS server. The default should never be edited. Now let’s look at a sample DNS file for the domain lahai.com ('''named.lahai.com''')

:&lt;tt&gt;; file /var/named/named.lahai.com

:@ IN SOA ns.lahai.com. gaurab.lahai.com. (
:2004050801 ; serial number
:86400 ; refresh: once per day (1D)
:3600 ; retry: one hour (1H)
:3600000 ; expire: 42 days (6W)
:604800 ; minimum: 1 week (1W)
:)&lt;/tt&gt;

:&lt;tt&gt;# we are specifying three Name servers.

:IN NS ns.lahai.com.
:IN NS a.ns.hopcount.ca.
:IN NS ns1.lahai.com.&lt;/tt&gt;

:&lt;tt&gt;# local mail is distributed on another server

:IN MX 10 mail.lahai.com.
:IN MX 20 ns.lahai.com.&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;; loopback address
:localhost. IN A 127.0.0.1&lt;/tt&gt;

:&lt;tt&gt;# The glue records so that the NS records can resolve.

:ns IN A 204.61.208.110
:ns1 IN A 202.79.55.14&lt;/tt&gt;

:&lt;tt&gt;# main DNS entry

:www IN A 207.189.222.2
:mail IN A 202.51.76.8&lt;/tt&gt;

:&lt;tt&gt;# Aliases for the www machine.

:tftp IN CNAME www&lt;/tt&gt;

The above file is the main file for the domain ‘lahai.com’. If you want to add additional names for the domain ‘lahai.com’, like pop3.lahai.com and smtp.lahai.com, then you should add them in the above file.

The order in which the name servers are listed in this file makes them master and slave. The first NS is always the master server and the other two are slave servers. Each time the master server is updated, it can automatically send a notification to the other NS servers listed in the file. This parameter can be configured in the named.conf file.

==== A note about Reverse DNS ====
The majority of DNS-related problems are usually due to mis-configured reverse DNS. Reverse DNS is the mapping of numbers into names, or the opposite of the forward name resolution. Many applications use this facility to verify that the network source IP address is valid. A common example is SPAM or unsolicited commercial e-mail (junk e-mail) prevention software, which may refuse to accept mails from any domain that does not have a reverse DNS configured.

The reverse DNS works through delegation of the particular group of IP addresses from one of the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), which is Asia Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC) (http://www.apnic.net) in the Asia-Pacific region. Since Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are normally APNIC members, they are responsible for configuring the appropriate reverse DNS for the IP addresses being used by them and their clients.

Since each computer has its own loopback interface and the IP address associated with it, BIND comes
with the default installation of the '''named.local''' file, which is the reverse DNS for 127.0.0.0 network. This file looks like the following:

:&lt;tt&gt;; /var/named/named.local
:$TTL 86400
:@ IN SOA localhost. root.localhost. (
:1997022700 ; Serial
:28800 ; Refresh
:14400 ; Retry
:3600000 ; Expire
:86400 ) ; Minimum
:IN NS localhost.
:1 IN PTR localhost.&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Administrating BIND DNS ===
BIND includes a utility called '''rndc''' that allows you to administer the named daemon, locally or remotely,with command line statements. The rndc program uses the ‘'''/etc/rndc.conf'''’ file for its configuration options, which can be overridden with command line options.

Before you can use the rndc, you need to add the following to your named.conf file:

:&lt;tt&gt;/etc/named.conf

:controls { 
:inet 127.0.0.1 allow { localhost; } keys { &lt;key-name&gt;; };
:};

:key “&lt;key-name&gt;” {
:algorithm hmac-md5;
:secret “&lt;key-value&gt;”;
:};&lt;/tt&gt;

In this case, the &lt;key-value&gt; is an HMAC-MD57&lt;ref&gt;A popular way to encrypt. It uses a one way hash algorithm for encryption.&lt;/ref&gt; key. You can generate your own HMAC-MD5 keys with the
following command:

:&lt;tt&gt;dnssec-keygen -a hmac-md5 -b &lt;bit-length&gt; -n HOST &lt;key-file-name&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

A key with at least a 256-bit length is a good idea. The actual key that should be placed in the &lt;keyvalue&gt; area can be found in the &lt;key-file-name&gt;.

Configuration file /etc/rndc.conf

&lt;tt&gt;
:options {
:default-server localhost;
:default-key “&lt;key-name&gt;”;
:};

:server localhost {
:key “&lt;key-name&gt;”;
:};

:key “&lt;key-name&gt;” {
:algorithm hmac-md5;
:secret “&lt;key-value&gt;”;
:};&lt;/tt&gt;

The &lt;key-name&gt; and &lt;key-value&gt; should be exactly the same as their settings in /etc/named.conf.

To test all of the settings, try the rndc reload command. You should see a response similar to this:

:&lt;tt&gt;rndc: reload command successful&lt;/tt&gt;

You can also use the rndc reload to reload any changes made to your DNS files.

=== DNS Tools ===
There are two common tools to test DNS: '''nslookup''' and '''dig'''. Nslookup is the older of the two, and is less preferred. You can use the '''dig''' utility to test the DNS service. Use the command ‘'''man dig'''’ on most Unix
and Unix-like systems to access the relevant manual pages.

== The Mail Server ==
Internet and e-mail were considered synonymous in the early days of the Internet. Even today, more
than a quarter of the total Internet traffic is still e-mail, and it is not surprising that FOSS rules the world of e-mail. On the Internet, e-mail messages work on the basis of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) which is defined in RFC 2821. SMTP is a really simple protocol designed to make the transfer of e-mail messages between mail servers as easy as possible.

SMTP works in plain text, and communicates between the mail servers, which are also referred to as Mail Transfer Agents or MTAs. The most popular mail server software is ‘sendmail’. Other examples are exim, qmail, and postfix. The closed source alternatives are Lotus Notes and Microsoft Exchange.

The beauty of FOSS is the level of software complexity available. While exim and postfix have a smaller footprint and consume a small amount of memory on the servers, sendmail is a complex beast that runs the busiest mail servers of the world.

Another important benefit of FOSS mail servers is the modularity of the software. Sendmail itself provides for a large number of extensions and provision for including modules. This makes it easier for developers to extend the software for their in-house needs. If you need to develop an extension to your e-mail server to automatically handle different types of e-mail, FOSS is a better option.

=== Other Mail-related Protocols ===
The two main mail-related protocols are Post Office Protocol (POP) and Internet Mail Access Protocol
(IMAP). These provide the end-user functionality for users. POP and IMAP are used by e-mail software for accessing e-mails stored on a server. So if you use an e-mail client like Eudora or Thunderbird, then it will use either POP or IMAP to pull e-mail from your mail server to the local machine.

=== Handling Spam === 
Unsolicited Commercial E-mail (UCE) or spam is increasingly a big problem for all service providers. Most mail server software now have at least minimum anti-spam features.

==== Incoming spam ====
Spam Assassin is a popular software used to filter incoming spam. It can be invoked for either a single user or the whole system, and provides the ability to configure a complex set of rules to detect and delete incoming spam.

==== Stopping outgoing spam ====
It is also the duty of the provider not to let spammers use their network for sending mail. Mis-configured mail servers that allow for open-relay are some of the biggest sources of spam. Increasingly, mail servers are configured not to be open-relay by default. Virus-infected computers are also another source of spam.

=== Anti-spam Features ===
One of the biggest advantages of FOSS is its extensibility. Nothing highlights this more than the antispam features available in mail servers. Today, almost 80 percent of all e-mail messages are thought to be UCE, commonly referred to as junk e-mail or simply spam. UCE not only consumes a lot of bandwidth and network resources, it is also a nuisance to users and decreases productivity for organizations.

The best anti-spam tools available today are all FOSS. In order to stop junk e-mail, it is necessary to identify their origin, and what better way of doing this than thousands of users collectively identifying spammers. The FOSS concept makes sure that not a single junk e-mail goes unreported so that the origin can be identified easily.

A common anti-spam technique is the use of Real Time Block Lists or RBLs. Different RBLs list the IP
addresses of networks that are known to be the origin of huge amounts of spam. Again, the open nature
of these lists, as well as software like Spam Assassin, makes it easier to tune the software to a user’s own needs.

For example, in a corporate environment, the users needed to send e-mail in capital letters due to the nature of their work. Now, if the entire e-mail were in capital letters, most anti-spam tools would identify it as junk e-mail. However, if we use FOSS solution, we can modify the code and remove this criterion for mail originating from within the network.

== Using Sendmail for SMTP ==
Sendmail is one of the SMTP servers available under Linux. It is also one of the oldest open source software that is widely used. Many people consider sendmail to be too complicated and difficult to use. Sendmail has its advantages and disadvantages. Because it has many features, it is a complex piece of software. But, at the same time, the basic operations of sendmail can be managed easily.

Sendmail configuration is handled either by directly editing the sendmail configuration file (not
recommended) or through the use of the M4 macro language in creating a new configuration file from a
set of variables.

Now we will deal with sendmail. Given below are the minimum necessary changes to the default sendmail
installation.

=== Enabling Network-ability in sendmail ===
Default installation of software in many distributions is limited to the mail server listening only on the loopback address,&lt;ref&gt;The IP address of the loopback interface is 127.0.0.1&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., the server is not reachable over the network. For sendmail to be reachable from the network, you will need to edit the appropriate line in the '''/etc/mail/sendmail.mc''' file. You should edit to remove 127.0.0.1 from the following line

:&lt;tt&gt;DAEMON_OPTIONS (‘Port=smtp, Name=MTA’)&lt;/tt&gt;

After that you will have to run the m4 macro to create new sendmail configuration files

:&lt;tt&gt;[root@mail /etc/mail]# m4 sendmail.mc &gt; sendmail.cf
:[root@mail /etc/mail]# service sendmail restart&lt;/tt&gt;

This should enable network reachability for the sendmail daemon. There are also a lot of other options on the sendmail.mc file that you can play around with.

=== Local Domain Names ===
Edit /etc/mail/local-host-names and add all domain and domain aliases that your site uses.

:&lt;tt&gt;# local-hosts-names -&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# include all aliases for your machine here.
:lahai.com
:gaurab.org.np
:ns.lahai.com&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# some examples
:mail.you.com
:yoursite1.com
:mail.yoursite1.com
:yoursite2.com
:mail.yoursite2.com
:yoursite3.com
:mail.yoursite3.com&lt;/tt&gt;

These are necessary so that sendmail accepts mail for these domains.

=== Virtual Domain Users ===
However, the above configuration does not entirely solve the problem of virtual domain users. For that, use the virtusertable feature. Go to /etc/mail/virtusertable

:&lt;tt&gt;# /etc/mail/virtusertable&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;#virtual e-mail address real username
:user1@yoursite1.com user1_yoursite1&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# for domain pop, i.e, all e-mail in a domain into a single account
:@yoursite2.com yoursite2&lt;/tt&gt;

Be sure to restart the sendmail daemon after making the changes.

:&lt;tt&gt;[root@mail /etc/mail]# service sendmail restart&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Access Control ===
Sendmail provides an access control feature through the /etc/mail/access file.

:&lt;tt&gt;# /etc/mail/access
:spam@cybermail.com REJECT
:aol.com REJECT
:207.46.131.30 REJECT
:postmaster@aol.com OK
:linux.org.np RELAY
:192.0.2. OK&lt;/tt&gt;

OK - Accept the mail message.
RELAY - Accept messages from this host or user even if they are not destined for our host; that is, accept messages for relaying to other hosts from this host.
REJECT - Reject the mail with a generic message.

It is required that you allow RELAY from your own network. Otherwise, computers on the network using
the server as their outgoing SMTP server will not be able to send e-mail.

=== Running sendmail as System Daemon ===
The script is located at /etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail and is started automatically when the computer is started. You can also start it using other commands

:&lt;tt&gt;[root@mail /etc/mail]# /etc/init.d/sendmail start
:[root@mail /etc/mail]# service sendmail restart&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Running sendmail from xineted ===
It is a good idea (from a security standpoint) to have sendmail run from xinetd.conf and not as a standalone daemon. For that we need to add it to /etc/xinetd.d directory and remove it from /etc/rc.d/init.d, and then add the sendmail queue processing to cron. Here is what you have to do:

1. When using xinetd, create a file sendmail in /etc/xinetd.d/ similar to

:&lt;tt&gt;default: on
:service sendmail
:{
:socket_type = stream
:wait = no
:user = root
:server = /usr/bin/sendmail -bs
:}&lt;/tt&gt;

2. Edit /etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail to have exit 0 somewhere in the very beginning (this might not be the best way, so be sure to document the changes you do to these files) so that this file does nothing other than start sendmail.

3. By editing your (root’s) crontab9 (to edit use crontab -e), add a line like this

:&lt;tt&gt;*/20 * * * * /usr/sbin/sendmail -q&lt;/tt&gt;

That would process the sendmail queue every 20 minutes (if it exists).

=== Other Mail Servers ===
The other popular mail servers are postfix, exim, and qmail. While postfix is shipped as a default on a few Linux distributions, many small service providers have adopted exim because of its simplicity and robustness. Exim also has strong anti-spam features built into it.

== The Web Server – Apache ==
The dominance of FOSS in the web server market is well known. The Apache web server is the undisputed
leader in web server surveys conducted on the Internet. It also has many strengths: it is the leader in introducing name-based virtual hosts, and the first truly modular web server that would work seamlessly with database servers. It also has fully built authentication, authorization and access control functions, as well as scripting support.

== April 2006 Web Server Survey ==
The latest survey statistics are available at http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html

Apache also fully integrates with OpenSSL, which provides a secure sockets layer,&lt;ref&gt;Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encrypts data that is travelling over the public network.&lt;/ref&gt; thereby enabling
use of the Apache web server for e-commerce and secure transaction. And, best of all, it can be fully
configured through a text-based configuration file – httpd.conf.

=== Configuring Apache ===
Configuring Apache is also fairly easy, unless you want to run complex software on the web server. The configuration files are usually located by default in ‘/etc/httpd/conf’. Additional configuration files are located in ‘/etc/httpd’. It is also common for Apache to be installed in ‘/usr/local/apache’.

The main configuration file for Apache is the httpd.conf. Apache usually works out of the box.

=== The httpd.conf File ===
'''Directives''' are the settings that define how Apache should actually run, where files are located on your server, how much of the machine’s resources Apache may use, which content visitors are allowed to see, how many concurrent visitors the server can handle, and other parameters.

Let’s look at the main directives:

:&lt;tt&gt;/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf – the main configuration file&lt;/tt&gt;

{{TextBox|'''Server Identification'''

:ServerName: construct self-referential URLs
:ServerAdmin: e-mail of server administrator displayed on error messages

;'''File locations'''
:DocumentRoot - the location where the static content of your website lives
:ServerRoot – for relative location of files that do not begin with a slash “/”
:ErrorLog – to log server-wide error messages
:PidFile – contains process ID of the httpd process
:Alias – to serve files outside the DocumentRoot
:ScriptAlias – the location for CGI scripts, dynamic content generators
:DirectoryIndex - the file specified is displayed by default
:Userdir – to serve files from public_html dir in user’s home dir as http://www.site.com/~user

;'''Process creation'''
:MaxClients – the number of simultaneous connections allowed from clients
:Server-Pool Regulation - Apache under UNIX is multi-process; it balances the overhead required to spawn child processes with system resources. You can change setting such as MinSpareServers, MaxSpareServers, StartServers, MaxClients to fine tune the performance of the server.
:User,Group – set the privileges of the Apache child processes

;'''Network configuration'''
:BindAddress - restricts the server to listening to a single IP address
:Listen - specifies multiple IP addresses and/or Ports
:KeepAlive - an extension to HTTP, which provides a persistent connection
:Port – the TCP port number the web server runs on; can be changed to an unused port

:URL redirection:
:To redirect requests to another URL Redirect permanent /foo/ http://www.example.com/bar/
}}

=== Virtual Hosts ===
Virtual hosts is the practice of maintaining more than one web server name on one physical machine.
For example, the same physical machine can host both the http://www.apdip.net and http://www.iosn.net.

Parameters are specific to a virtual host, which overrides some of the main server configuration defaults. There can be two types of virtual hosts – IP-based and name-based.

In an IP-based virtual host, the IP address of the connection is used to determine the correct virtual host to serve. The approach requires a separate IP address for each virtual host.
In name-based virtual hosts, the host names are sent as part of the HTTP headers, which means that
many different hosts can share the same IP address. However, you will need to map each host to the IP
address in DNS. This eases the demand for scarce IP addresses. Name-based virtual hosts cannot be used with SSL secure servers and older software may not be compatible.

==== Virtual host directives ====

*NameVirtualHost – designate the IP address and port number to listen (optional)
*&lt;VirtualHost&gt; – same argument as NameVirtualHost
*ServerName – designate which host is served
*DocumentRoot – where in the file system the content for that host lives
*ServerAlias – make the host accessible by more than one name

Here is an example.

NameVirtualHost *

:&lt;tt&gt;&lt;VirtualHost *&gt;
:ServerName www.domain.tld
:DocumentRoot /www/domain
:&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

:&lt;VirtualHost *&gt;
:ServerName www.otherdomain.tld
:DocumentRoot /www/otherdomain
:serverAlias otherdomain.tld *.otherdomain.tld
:&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

If no matching virtual host is found, '''then the first listed virtual host''' that matches the IP address will be used. All other standard Apache directives can be used inside the virtual host directive.

=== Access Control per Directory using .htaccess file ===
.htaccess file is a text file containing Apache directives

AccessFileName .htaccess …in httpd.conf

.htaccess file contents

:&lt;tt&gt;AuthName “restricted stuff”
:AuthType Basic
:AuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/htusers
:AuthGroupFile /usr/local/httpd/htgroup
:require valid-user
:require group staff
:require user lahai gaurab
:AuthName “restrict posting”
:AuthType Basic
:AuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/htusers
:AuthGroupFile /usr/local/httpd/htgroup
:&lt;Limit POST&gt;
:require group admin
:&lt;/Limit&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

htpasswd – to manage users for access control

htpasswd -c /usr/local/etc/httpd/users martin

htpasswd /usr/local/etc/httpd/users ritesh

:&lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/etc/httpd/htusers contents:
:martin:WrU808BHQai36
:jane:iABCQFQs40E8M
:art:FAdHN3W753sSU

:/usr/local/httpd/htgroup contents:
:staff:martin jane
:admin:lahai gaurab&lt;/tt&gt;

== Proxy and Web Caching with Squid ==
As with mail servers and web servers, FOSS also set the standard in the area of proxy and cache servers. Squid is synonymous with proxy services in the networking world. It is a very modular, high performance proxy and web caching server. The Squid website is http://www.squid-cache.org. Squid proxy caches can be clustered to provide much better speed and access. Squid cache was also one of the first cache systems to implement a hierarchical cache system.

Some advantages of Squid:
*High-performance proxy caching server for web clients
*A full-feature web proxy cache
*Designed to run on UNIX systems
*Free, open source software
*Handles all requests in a single, non-blocking I/O-driven process
*Keeps meta data and especially hot objects cached in RAM
*Caches DNS lookups
*Implements negative caching of failed requests
*Supports SSL, extensive access controls, and full request logging
*Using ICP, caches can be arranged in a hierarchy or mesh for additional bandwidth savings

Squid consists of:
*Main server program Squid
*DNS lookup program dnsserver for faster DNS lookups
*Optional programs for rewriting requests and performing authentication
*Some management and client tools

=== squid.conf – the Main Configuration File ===
*Default configuration file denies all client requests
*Configure to allow access only to trusted hosts and/or users
*Carefully design your access control scheme
*Checks it from time to time to make sure that it works as you expect
*People will abuse it if the proxy allows access from untrusted hosts or users
*Makes their browsing anonymous
*Intentionally uses your proxy for transactions that may be illegal
*Websites exist with a list of open-access HTTP proxies

Here is an example of the Squid configuration: to run basic Squid, the only thing configurable is the
proxy port. The default Squid proxy port is 3128 but you can always change it.

:&lt;tt&gt;Network options
:http_port port Hostname: port&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Squid Access Control ===
Squid is better known for its complex access control system. You can allow and restrict access based not only on IP addresses but also on domain name. The use of regular expression lets you create complex rules for access through the proxy server. For access control in Squid, a sophisticated access control system, similar to the one used in routers, is used. It is basically a two-step process:

#Defining the access listed through use of the acl command; and
#Allowing or denying access based on the access list created earlier.

i. acl used for defining an Access List. ‘
‘acl’ literally stands for access control list. The default ACLs are:

:&lt;tt&gt;acl all src 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;acl manager proto cache_object
:acl localhost src 127.0.0.1/255.255.255.255
:acl SSL_ports port 443 563
:acl Safe_ports port 80 21 443 563 70 210 1025-65535&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;acl Safe_ports port 280 # http-mgmt
:acl Safe_ports port 488 # gss-http
:acl Safe_ports port 591 # filemaker
:acl Safe_ports port 777 # multiling http
:acl CONNECT method CONNECT&lt;/tt&gt;

ii. http_access – to control http access to clients
If there are no “access” lines present, the default is to allow the request.

:&lt;tt&gt;Default
:http_access allow manager localhost
:http_access deny manager
:http_access deny !Safe_ports
:http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports
:http_access deny all&lt;/tt&gt;

The “deny all” line is very important.

{{TextBox|'''EXAMPLES'''

;'''Restrict access to work hours (9 am-5 pm, Monday to Friday) from IP 192.168.2/24'''
:&lt;tt&gt;acl ip_acl src 192.168.2/24
:acl time_acl time M T W H F 9:00-17:00
:http_access allow ip_acl time_acl
:http_access deny all&lt;/tt&gt;

;'''Rules are read from top to bottom'''
:&lt;tt&gt;acl xyz src 172.161.163.86
:acl morning time 06:00-11:00
:acl lunch time 14:00-14:30
:http_access allow xyz morning

:http_access deny xyz
:http_access allow xyz lunch&lt;/tt&gt;

;'''Be careful with the order of allowing subnets'''
:&lt;tt&gt;acl mynetwork src 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0
:acl servernet src 10.0.1.0/255.255.255.0

:http_access deny servernet
:http_access allow mynet&lt;/tt&gt;

;'''Always_direct and never_direct tags'''
:&lt;tt&gt;# always go direct to local machines
:always_direct allow my-iplist-1
:always_direct allow my-iplist-2&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# never go direct to other hosts
:never_direct allow all&lt;/tt&gt;
}}

After all of the http_access rules, if access is not denied, then it is allowed.

If none of the “http_access” lines cause a match, then the default is the opposite of the last line in the list.

It is a good idea to have a “deny all” or “allow all” entry at the end of your access lists.

iii. cache_dir: dir to store cached data

:&lt;tt&gt;cache_dir /usr/local/squid/cache/ 100 16 256&lt;/tt&gt;

Can support more than one disk with multiple mount points

:&lt;tt&gt;cache_dir /usr/local/squid/cache1/ 10000 16 256
:cache_dir /usr/local/squid/cache2/ 20000 16 256&lt;/tt&gt;

iv. cache_mgr: e-mail of the Cache Admin

Appended to the end of error pages returned to users

:&lt;tt&gt;cache_effective_user squid
:cache_effective_group squid
:Changes user and group ID’s once it has bound to the incoming
:network port
:ftp_user: set the e-mail address that is used for FTP proxy&lt;/tt&gt;

'''Client:''' Connects to a cache and requests a page, and prints out useful timing information v. Squid logs

:&lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/squid/logs/cache.log
:/usr/local/squid/logs/access.log&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Transparent Caching/Transparent Proxy ===
This picks up the appropriate packets, caches requests and solves the biggest problem with caching,
which is getting users to use the cache server in a transparent way. Four factors need to be considered:

*Correct network layout - all network traffic needs to pass through a filter device
*Filtering: filtering out the appropriate packets
*Kernel transparency: redirecting port 80 connections to Squid
*Squid settings: Squid needs to know that it is supposed to act in transparent mode

A detailed explanation of how to achieve transparent proxy is available at http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/TransparentProxy.html.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.49}}

The previous ''Die Easy'' tutorial needed so many changes to adapt to Blender 2.44 that it was easier to start from scratch. This ''Die Easy 2'' tutorial is heavily based on ''Die Easy'' and ''Die Another Way'', and adds improvements.

In the following tutorial, you will use:
*polygon mesh
*face loop cutting
*subdivision surfaces
*subdivision creases
*bevel
*set smooth
*multiple materials
*extrusion
*merge vertices


==Start with a beveled cube==
Start with the [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Beginning Tips|default scene]]: Blender should be in ''Object Mode'' and in ''Top'' view, with the default cube selected.

* Go to ''Edit Mode'' ({{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}}). All the vertices should still be selected. (If not, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} to select all).

* Let's bevel the cube. The ''bevel'' option is in the '''modifiers context'''. Click on the modifiers icon (the little blue wrench on the side panel) and from the ''add modifiers'' choose '''Bevel'''.
** '''Noob note''' :- for anyone using v2.56 and below, Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}}, select ''Bevel'' from the menu and click ''OK''
* Set the bevel to 0.1  by typing ''.1'' and pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}.
* Finally, '''Apply''' the modifier to your cube before proceeding. 

              (For Blender 2.63 : You should be in 'Object Mode' in order to Apply the Bevel Modifier.)
  
* For Blender versions earlier than 2.48 : in the ''Recursion: 1 OK'' dialog, Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}} (it will revert to the black on grey) and click on the ''OK'' button. (For Blender version 2.48 and above, skip this step)
:''Note : The recursion levels go from 1 to 4. At 1 it seems to be crude but the cube will be subdivided later, so a higher recursion level is not required.''



[[Image:bevel-done.png|200px]]

==Divide the faces==
A typical die face is made of a grid with 9 possible spot positions. The gaps between the spots usually measure half a spot (a spot radius). Using the spot radius as a unit, a die face will be conveniently divided into 10 equal parts through the length (that is, four gaps and three spots each two units long).

[[Image:9 posiciones.jpg|341px]]&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:muescas y espacios.jpg|341px]]&lt;br&gt;

===First division===
*Make sure you're still in ''Edit Mode'' (else hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}}), that you're in ''Front'' view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}), and that the whole cube is still selected.

*To divide the faces of the cube into 10 vertical strips :

'''For v2.57 and above :'''
*Just use the '''loop cut and slide''' option by hitting {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|R}} in the tool shelf to the left and scroll the mouse wheel to scale up the number of cuts to 9.

'''For other versions of Blender :'''
*Press the {{B3D:N2P/Do|K}} and choose ''Knife (Multicut)'' from the popup menu.
**A new popup asks: ''Number of Cuts: 2''. Change the value to ''9'':
*** click on the ''of'' word and type ''9'',
*** or drag from the input field ({{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}) until you reach ''9'',
*** or use the right arrow.
**Then click on ''OK''.

[[Image:Blender-Die Easy 2-Knife.png|right]]
*To actually use the ''Multicut'' tool, draw one vertical cut through the cube: the knife icon traces a pink line. It doesn't have to be exactly vertical nor does it have to go through the cube center.

[[Image:front-face-9v-cuts.png|200px|left]]
*Finally press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}} and all the faces of the cube crossing the knife will be divided into 10 vertical strips.

'''Note:''' You can have a look at all the other faces by dragging with the {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}}.

'''Noob Note:''' When you are cutting through the cube, make sure to cut the entire cube, including the beveled part of the cube.  Otherwise your cube won't divide properly.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

===Remove extra cuts===
To get each spot position to be a single face rather than four contiguous faces, the second, fifth and eighth cuts must be removed.

*Press the {{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} to deselect all the vertices, switch to ''Edge select mode'' and make sure ''Limit selection to visible'' is off (in Blender 2.46 and above this button is called ''Occlude background geometry'').

[[Image:select-edge-mode.png|200px|left]]
[[Image:limit-selection-to-visible.png|400px|right|The button is disabled (off)]]

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

[[Image:second-cut-selected.png|200px|left]]

*Select an edge from the second cut, and choose ''Select &amp;rarr; Edge Loop'' from the viewport menu. This automatically selects all the edges around the cube (in a loop).

'''Note:''' You can alternatively press the {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}} key while selecting an edge from the second cut to select all the eges belonging to this cut around the cube.

'''For Linux users:''' If pressing the {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}} key while selecting an edge from the chosen cut brings up a Linux menu, try hitting {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}} instead.


[[Image:second-cut-removed.png|200px|right]]
*Press the {{B3D:N2P/Do|X}} and select ''Edge Loop'' from the popup menu. The cube will look like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

*Deselect all ({{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}) and repeat the same actions to remove the fifth and eighth cuts:

[[Image:fifth-cut-selected.png|200px|left]]
[[Image:fifth-cut-removed.png|200px|right]]

[[Image:eighth-cut-selected.png|200px|left]]
[[Image:eighth-cut-removed.png|200px|right]]

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

===Other divisions===
For the horizontal cuts use the same steps as above, but horizontally!

'''Noob Note:''' Make sure the whole cube is selected when cutting.

[[Image:front-face-9h-cuts.png|200px|left]]
[[Image:front-face-h-cuts-finished.png|200px|right]]

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

*Now, if you rotate the cube around, you will see that the front and back faces ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}} to see the back face) are divided vertically and horizontally. But the four other ones were only divided once.

*To complete the divisions, go to the ''Side'' view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}), select the whole cube ({{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}). Make the vertical cuts and remove the second, fifth and eighth cuts again:

[[Image:all-cuts-done.png|200px]]

==Colouring the Cube==
[[Image:shading-panel-icon.png|200px|right]]
You need to be in object mode for this step.  Select the ''Shading'' group from the header in the ''Button Window'' ({{B3D:N2P/Do|F5}}).

*edit Properties Window in ver 2.64

Change the name of the material (which for example defines colours) currently linked to the cube: in the ''Links and Pipeline'' panel, under the title &quot;Link to Object&quot;, click on &quot;Material&quot; in the &quot;MA:Material&quot; box. &quot;Material&quot; will now be highlighted: delete it and type &quot;DieWhite&quot; instead, then press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}.

[[Image:material-ramps-panel.png|200px|left]]
Now choose a color: go to the next panel (the one with two tabs, ''Material'' and ''Ramps''), and make sure the ''Material'' tab is selected.

[[Image:Manual-Part-I-Interface-ColorSelector-Dialog.png|200px|right]]
In the second group of buttons, click on the colour bar which is on the left of the ''Col'' button: it opens the colour selector.

Select the colour you want in the rainbow bar (bottom left of the popup), move the tiny circle in the colour window above it to adjust the shade. When done, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}.

'''''Note:''''' you can choose any colour. In this tutorial we selected the white colour by clicking on the corresponding box available from the sixteen predefined ones (the two vertical rows in the middle).''

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

==Adding the spots==
[[Image:face-select-mode.png|200px|right]]
Go to the ''Front'' view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}) and set ''Face select mode''. Also make sure that ''Limit selection to visible'' is enabled (in Blender 2.46 and above this button is called ''Occlude background geometry'').

We will create two different kinds of spots.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

===First method===
[[Image:alt-m-one-spot.png|200px|left]]
This one's from the ''Die Another Way'' tutorial.

We'll make the number five on the current face. Deselect all ({{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}) and select a first spot (the one in the top left corner).

Extrude the face by hitting {{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} and then {{B3D:N2P/Do|ESC}} (do not click after hitting {{B3D:N2P/Do|E}}).

Collapse this face by using {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|M}} and choosing ''At Center'' from the popup menu. This merges the four corners of the extruded face into its centre. Click on the message saying ''Removed 3 Vertices''.

[[Image:alt-m-five-spots.png|200px|right]]
Repeat the same keystroke sequence on the four other spots: {{B3D:N2P/Do|E}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|ESC}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|M}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}.

Now choose the ''Vertex select mode'' and select five vertices, one at each spot center ({{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} for the first one, {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} for the subsequent ones). Then push the selection inwards using the {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}} and constraining the move to the Y axis ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Y}}). Move by 0.17 units to get the same die as shown in the picture below.

[[Image:alt-m-five-spots-grabbed.png|200px]]

===Second method===
This method was suggested by Natume in the ''Die Easy'' tutorial and modified by another user.

Deselect all ({{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}) and select the faces you want to create spots on ({{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} for the first one, {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} for subsequent ones).

Press the {{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} to extrude them, if you selected more than one face a popup menu will give you two options: press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}} to select ''Region'' (the choice doesn't matter), and then press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ESC}}. Do not click after hitting {{B3D:N2P/Do|E}}.

Divide the selected faces into triangles with {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|T}} (or {{B3D:N2P/Do|SPACE}} ''&amp;rarr; Edit &amp;rarr; Faces &amp;rarr; Convert to Triangles'').
[Noob note: In versions 2.63+, in the subdivide choices menu that pops up at the bottom of the tools menu, you must make sure that the check box for Quad/Tri Mode is checked or only the diagonal line will be divided and no triangles are created]

[[Image:face-converted-to-triangles.png|200px]]

Deselect all ({{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}) and change to ''Edge select mode''. Select all the diagonal edges resulting from the above divisions, and subdivide them: {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}} (or {{B3D:N2P/Do|SPACE}} ''&amp;rarr; Edit &amp;rarr; Edges &amp;rarr; Subdivide'').

[[Image:face-spots-subdivided.png|200px]]

Now deselect all ({{B3D:N2P/Do|A}}), go into ''Vertex select mode'' and select all five vertices of each spot face (for example, use circle select with {{B3D:N2P/Do|B}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|B}}, and adjust the size of the circle with {{B3D:N2P/Do|SCROLL}}, then click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} to select; click {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} when the selection is complete).
[Noob note: In versions 2.63+, C activates the Circle Select mode, B activates the Box Select mode]

Push the faces inward by 0.17 units ({{B3D:N2P/Do|G}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|Y}}).

[[Image:alt-m-five-spots-grabbed.png|200px]]

=== Third method===  
In the prior two methods you create indentations in the faces that are triangle ( mountain peak ) shaped, if you would prefer them to be square shaped ( or flat ) then simply select the faces (using face select mode) that will be used as spots and extrude them inward by the prescribed number of units (either .17 or -.17 depending on the side).   



[[Image:five-spots-extruded.png|200px]]

===The other die faces===
Now repeat the method to the other faces. Remember that adding two opposite face values (of the die) yields 7.

If you started with the ''Front'' view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}) and set 5 spots, the ''Back'' view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}) will have 2 spots (the extrusion length will be -0.17 instead of 0.17).

If you then go to Side view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}})  — the righthand side &amp;mdash; and put 6 spots there (extrusion -0.17 along the X axis, {{B3D:N2P/Do|X}}), the lefthand side ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM3}}) will have 1 (extrusion 0.17).

If you put 4 on the top (Top view {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM7}}, extrusion -0.17 along the Z axis, {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}) then the bottom ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM7}}) will have 3 (extrusion 0.17).

When all the spots have been created, the cube should look like this &amp;mdash; the top lefthand corner is nearest, using the first method (named ''Alt-M'')

[[Image:alt-m-all-spots-done.png|200px]]

using the third method (named ''Ctrl-T'')

[[Image:ctrl-t-all-spots-done.png|200px]]

==Subsurfing and smoothing==
[[Image:Editing-panel-modifiers-subsurf.png|thumb|200px|The ''Editing'' panel icon, ''Modifiers'' panel and ''Set Smooth'' button]]
Leave the ''Edit Mode'' for the ''Object Mode'' ({{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}}) and select the ''Editing'' panel in the ''Buttons'' window (or press {{B3D:N2P/Do|F9}}).

To turn on subsurfing, click on ''Add Modifier'' in the ''Modifiers'' panel (if you can't see the button, make sure the tab is selected) and select ''Subsurf'' from the popup menu.

The default value for ''Levels'' is 1 and for ''Render Levels'' is 2. For a nicer preview, change ''Levels'' from 1 to 2 by clicking once on the right arrow, and click on ''Set Smooth'' in the ''Links and Materials'' panel.

The cube will now look like this (''Front'' view):

[[Image:alt-m-subsurf-level-2-set-smooth.png|left|200px|thumb|''method 1 &amp; method 2'']]
[[Image:ctrl-t-subsurf-level-2-set-smooth.png|200px|thumb|''method 3'']]

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

=== Subsurface creasing ===
On a die, the edges around the spots are usually sharp so we'll use subsurface creasing to do that.

Go back to ''Edit Mode'' ({{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} once or twice), and ''Edge select mode'' ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|2}}) either select every spot perimeter as shown below ({{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} for the first one, {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} for the others), or use circle select as described next

[[Image:creasing-five-spots-selected.png|200px]]

==== Using circle select ====

You should be in '''Edit Mode''', be in &quot;Edge select mode&quot; ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|Tab}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|2}}), and have '''occlude background geometry''' turned on.

{{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} once or twice to be sure everything is deselected.

{{B3D:N2P/Do|B}},{{B3D:N2P/Do|B}}  to TURN ON circle select mode.

'''''Noob note:''''' In Blender 2.5x circle select mode can be used by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|C}} once.''

{{B3D:N2P/Do|MMW}} roll (don't press) middle mouse wheel to size the circle small enough to select single edges.

{{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} about twenty times, as there are 4 edges around each of 5 &quot;dots&quot;, so you will have to click 20 times with the left mouse button (once on each edge) to select them all. If you select an extra unwanted edge anywhere Then you can just click the {{B3D:N2P/Do|MMB}} (My wheel rolls or presses in).

{{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} to TURN OFF circle select mode.

====Creasing the edges====

Now move mouse pointer crosshairs (don't press any button here) near center of drawing.

{{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} to turn on Edge Crease mode. The bottom bar changes to a &quot;Crease&quot; number.

Now move mouse pointer crosshairs (don't press any button here) away from center of drawing. Watch the Crease number change as you pull out. It maxes out at 1.000.

{{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} When you get the crease you want the left mouse button locks it in place.

{{B3D:N2P/Do|A}} once, or twice, to deselect every thing.

Finished on this side. View a different side and do it all again.

[[Image:creasing-five-spots-done.png|200px]]

:'''''Note:''''' the {{B3D:N2P/Do|N}} shows an information box (with the perimeter edges still selected). The last line says: ''Median Crease W: 1.000'', if the value is less than 1.000 it means that an edge has been missed. You can update the crease values by clicking on the arrows. Click on the ''X'' in the top right corner to dismiss the dialog.

:'''''Noob Note''': setting the value of the subsurf creasing affects the subsurf modifier. You will not actually see the creasing effect unless the object has the subsurf modifier active. Try adding the subsurf modifier to the object then set the creasing to one so that you can see the effect it actually has on the object.''

Now crease the spots on the five other sides of the die. You should end up with:

[[Image:alt-m-all-spots-creased.png|200px|left|thumb|''method 1 &amp; method 2'']]
[[Image:ctrl-t-all-spots-creased.png|200px|thumb|''method 3'']]

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

==Colouring the spots==

===Creating a new material===
Go to the ''Editing'' panel ({{B3D:N2P/Do|F9}}) in the ''Buttons Window''.

The ''Links and Materials'' panel should be showing (in the right column) ''DieWhite'' and, under it, ''1 Mat 1'':

[[Image:links-and-materials-colour-showing.png|200px]]

To add another material, click on the ''New'' button (right under ''1 Mat 1''). This label changes to ''2 Mat 2'', and ''DieWhite'' changes to ''DieWhite.001''.

'''''Note:''''' if your Blender version is older than 2.44, there's an additional step. Go to the ''Links and Pipeline'' panel (''Shading'' or {{B3D:N2P/Do|F5}}), click on the ''2'' button right after the ''MA:DieWhite'' input and choose ''Single user'' in the popup menu.

''user request: please provide instructions for 2.45, 'Links and materials' panel has been replaced with 'Links and Pipeline' panel.  'ADD NEW' from dropdown initially containing 'MA: Material' does not increment the '1 Mat 1' fields leaving no clear way to add more than one material to an object.''
'' -- '''Answer from another user:''' You're looking at the Shading panel ({{B3D:N2P/Do|F5}}), you need to switch to the Editing panel ({{B3D:N2P/Do|F9}}), there you'll find the buttons just as described here.''

Set the colour for this new material: click on the white square on the left of ''2 Mat 2'' (in the ''Editing'' panels) or on the left of ''Col'' (in the ''Shading'' panel). To get the same colours as in this tutorial, choose black. Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}} to confirm your choice.

In the ''Links and Pipeline'' panel (''Shading'' or {{B3D:N2P/Do|F5}}), change the material name from ''DieWhite.001'' to ''SpotBlack''.

===Selecting the spot faces===
Now go into ''Edit Mode'', choose ''Face select mode'' and make sure ''Limit selection to visible'' is on.

Version 2.46
The &quot;Limit Selection To Visible&quot;, is now &quot;Occlude Background Geometry&quot;. It remains the button to the right of &quot;Face Select&quot;

Starting again with Front view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}) use circle select ({{B3D:N2P/Do|B}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|B}} &amp;mdash; use {{B3D:N2P/Do|SCROLL}} to reduce the size of the circle to less than the spot size so you don't select the outside faces) to select all the inside faces of each spot.

Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} to finish, select the ''Back'' view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM1}}), use circle select again and select the spot faces there, do the same with the other four die faces.

'''''Note:''' you can't change to a different face without stopping the circle select tool ({{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}}). You will have to click {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}}, change to another face, and start circle select again ({{B3D:N2P/Do|B}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|B}}).

This is what you should see when you have selected all the spots:

[[Image:alt-m-all-spots-selected.png|200px|thumb|left|''Alt-M'']]
[[Image:ctrl-t-all-spots-selected.png|200px|thumb|Ctrl-T]]

The selected faces internal to the spots are more visible in the ''Alt-M'' version as the spots created in ''Ctrl-T'' are more cylindrical; the ''Alt-M'' spots look more like hemispheres.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

===Assigning the new material to the spots===
Now that all the spot faces are selected, you can assign the ''SpotBlack'' material to them.

Go back to the ''Editing'' panels ({{B3D:N2P/Do|F9}}) and, in the ''Links and Materials'' panel make sure the material ''SpotBlack'' is selected. If it isn't, you can select it by clicking on the right arrow or the ''1'' on the right of ''2 Mat 1'', which should update to ''2 Mat 2''. Now click on the wide ''Assign'' button below and the spots will change to black (or the other colour you chose).

Here are the finished results:

[[Image:alt-m-all-spots-coloured.png|200px|thumb|left|''Alt-M'']]
[[Image:ctrl-t-all-spots-coloured.png|200px|thumb|''Ctrl-T'']]

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello Stine Loft, welcome to Wikibooks. My name is Andrew and I had been helping upload the previous UNDP-APDIP books to the server. I see you are creating a new book, [[FOSS: Network Infrastructure and Security]]. If you need any help, you can ask me [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my user talk page]]. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 11:49, 29 May 2007 (UTC)

:Category pages are just organizational tools, and you don't really have to write anything in those pages. Categories are used to keep track of related pages, such as all the pages that are part of a particular book. For instance, all the FOSS books are listed in the [[:Category:FOSS Books]] category, and all the APDIP books can be found in [[:Category:APDIP Books]]. All the individual pages of your new book are found in [[:Category:FOSS Network Infrastructure and Security]]. Like i said, you don't need to write anything in the category page.
:I've been looking at your work, and i'll help to fix any errors that I see. If you have a specific question about what i have done, you can ask me about it. If I do something that I dont think is particularly obvious, I will send you a message to let you know.
:Anyway, good luck, and let me know if you need anything. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 02:59, 30 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:Whiteknight/Nav}}

== Resources ==

http://www.nsdc.org/library/publications/tools/tools4-04rich.cfm

== Democracy and Votes ==

Wikibooks is most certainly not a democracy, and attempts at votes in the past have been met with poor success rates. I'm not talking about success in terms of the affirmative side carrying the day, but instead in terms of a reasonable decision being reached. Some pages do very well with a voting system, or at least a pseudo-voting system. Pages such as [[WB:FB]] and [[WB:VFD]] do well with a binary SUPPORT / OBJECT system, because people feel more compelled to provide their rationale on these pages. Even a neutral vote that is very poignant can be very compelling for or against a particular course of action. Featured books and votes for deletion are relatively low impact, and people don't mind participating in these with gusto because the outcomes really don't matter in the big sense.

Situations where there is a nomination and then a vote, such as FB, VFD, or RFA, there is already a nomination on the table that supporters may agree with without having to reiterate all their opinions on the matter. Saying simply &quot;support&quot; is analogous to saying &quot;I agree with the nomination, and have nothing further to add&quot;. The burden falls on the opposition to not only say &quot;i do not agree&quot;, but also to explain why.

== Voting Continuum ==

[[User:Xixtas]] introduced a great idea when talking about the new What is Wikijunior policy: Instead of a binary vote, he created a series of templates that displayed a continuum of opinions. In this way people with only a vague objection could register that without having to be either &quot;for&quot; or &quot;against&quot;. Likewise, people with only a vague sense of support could register that appropriately. 

Where there are discreet options, however, there will always be a tendency to tabulate those opinions mathematically. Also, when you give people a set of available options, people may tend to incorrectly estimate their level of approval. For instance, a person's comments may signal a stronger and more well-thought-out objection then their vote would have indicated. 

== Problems: Finding Solutions ==

When presented with a problem, it is natural and common for people to present solutions. The community will mull the options, and then select one or none from among them. At least this is the ideal way of doing things, but in a consensus-driven community this is not usually the way it works out.

Given a proposed solution to a problem, some people will invariably say &quot;no&quot;, and several people may follow that up with &quot;here is my rational for my objection&quot;. However, if all solutions have been objected to in this way, then the community is stuck with both the problem and a complete inability to fix it. In essence, we are in a situation where the community has deemed all possible solutions to be worse then the problem, and instead of acting to fix it, the community has resigned itself to simply live with it. This despite the availablity of potential solutions, all of which are in a qualitative sense likely to be far better then the problem.

Objecting to a problem's solution, without supplying a different solution is akin to saying &quot;You shouldn't fix the problem, and I am not going to help with it either&quot;. This is, perhaps, the single worst viewpoint, and one which should not only be ignored but likely also scorned. In wiki, all people are allowed to have an equal say, but there is also the equal power for all people to help make improvements. You cannot both say &quot;We need something better&quot; and &quot;I am not willing to create/suggest/employ something better&quot;. While a particular solution may not be ideal, any solution is preferable to a grave enough problem.

== Process: Expendibility ==

The process of finding concensus and discussing an issue among the community is only good so far as it produces results. If it does not work, then we should throw it out period. Sometimes we need to '''be bold''' and just do things ourselves. The key is improvement and progress, and knowing what process to use to reach those goals is the most important lesson that we can learn.

== The Enemy of my Enemy ==

I care about this project, and want this project to succeed. Some people disagree with things that I want to do. Therefore, those people don't want the project to succeed, and are enemies of Wikibooks.

If you find yourself thinking like this, log off from your account and walk away from the computer. This attitude is never productive, never helpful, and is always absolutely wrong.</text>

== Hi ==

And goos to hear from you.  Never believe what other wikis say about what each one &quot;wants&quot; - the lack of cross project understanding is amazing.  Your book looks ok to me as a text book BUT you would be better posting [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge/New|here]] where you should get wider opinions - give it a try will you.  Let me know though if I can help - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:34, 10 September 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Impersonation ==

I'm sorry about that mess with the guy accusing you of identity theft. I emailed that user, and there was a misunderstanding. The issue should be over now. Let me know if you have any questions. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:24, 25 September 2007 (UTC)

== Watching books ==

And sorry but the answer as far as I know is &quot;no&quot;.  When you think about it I guess it would be a desirable feature on this wiki though.  May be worth posting in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Technical Assistance]] or [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance]] though.  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:36, 15 October 2007 (UTC)

:What has been done on Muggles' Guide is to make a single page containing links to all pages in the book (done by a bot), and then you can see the changes by going to the Related Changes from that page. Alternately if your book's pages are all in some category or other, you can check the pages related to that category with the Related Changes. The Muggles' Guide pages were all given a category by a bot in the far distant past... if you need more information, feel free to ask.

== Could you help? ==

If you have any knowledge on these subjects, could you help work on [[Linear Algebra]], [[Differential Geometry]], [[Topology]], or [[Real Analysis]]? --[[User:The Scarlet Letter|A]] ([[User talk:The Scarlet Letter|talk]]) 20:59, 4 January 2008 (UTC)

== Image issue ==

It look fine in my browser - try clearing your browser cache maybe?  I get the full image --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:19, 4 February 2008 (UTC)

== Re:Question ==

Books released under the GFDL are free to copy and to fork. That means that we can copy their book to our server, so long as we provide proper attribution to them. There isn't a &quot;standard&quot; way of providing such attribution, however, so you would need to use your best judgement and err on the side of caution.

In general, it's always a good idea to ask for their permission first, although legally we don't ''need'' permission if it is licensed under the GFDL. You are right that their book is far superior to our linear algebra book. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:06, 9 February 2008 (UTC)

:We can attribute him and link to his original versions in a number of ways. We can mention it in a note on the front page of the book and we can include a note about it in a page called &quot;Authors&quot; or something similar. We can also include a note about it on the book's talk page, and we can make short notes about it in the edit summaries as we upload text &quot;uploading content from X, originally written by Y, released under the GFDL&quot;. 
:PDFs can be a little tricky, because often you need to copy+paste the text manually. It may be worth asking whether the donor has the book available in any other format (microsoft .doc format would be perfect) because OpenOffice.org in the most recent version has the ability to export documents to mediawiki format. If he only has it in PDF, that's fine too. It's a little harder, but with enough time and some diligence it can all get uploaded accurately. It may be worth inviting the donor to join wikibooks, so that he can play an active role in improving this book too. 
:If you need help uploading a PDF, can I certainly willing and able. Just let me know what's going on. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:26, 12 February 2008 (UTC)

::Latex source may actually be easier, because we can probably do a machine translation (at least a partial one). Latex2Wiki translators may already exist somewhere, and if not I have a bot that could likely do much of the work (although my bot's output wouldn't be perfect). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:29, 12 February 2008 (UTC)

:I can help, but not until early next week. I have a number of important things due on friday (including my application for graduation!) that I really need to focus my attentions on right now. Starting early next week, I'll definitely check out what progress (if any) has been made, and start getting my hands dirty. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:58, 13 February 2008 (UTC)

::Yes I can help you, and I'm sorry that I've been delayed for so long. I have time tonight, and most of the rest of the week that I can concentrate on this. If I can get most of the groundwork set up, I think you'll get a much clearer idea of the process. I'll let you know how thigns are going. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:24, 11 March 2008 (UTC)

:As an aside, where are we uploading this book to? [[Linear Algebra]] is in poor condition but it has some existing content. I haven't looked over it in detail, but do you think it would be better to just overwrite it? Should we attempt to merge content, where possible? Should we move the old pages to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[PAGENAME/old]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or something similar so that it isn't lost and we can merge things in later? I actually like that last idea the most. &lt;s&gt;If you could start moving pages (and keep a short list of where the pages are moved to), I can start uploading the text soonish.&lt;/s&gt; --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:34, 11 March 2008 (UTC)
::Actually, never mind moving the pages. I'm going to try to construct the new book in parallel with the old book. I'm thinking about a setup similar to what's being used by [[Special Relativity]]: There are basically two books on that page, separated by reading level. I'm planning now to do the same thing with the Linear Algebra book, since this book that we are uploading seems to be relatively high-level. I've created a second TOC on the [[Linear Algebra]] page (down towards the bottom) where we will start uploading all our new stuff. After it's uploaded, we can make the page prettier, include more information about the different parts, etc. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:48, 11 March 2008 (UTC)
::Okay, that's a fair compromise. We will see how things are going after a few days/weeks. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:14, 11 March 2008 (UTC)

I have finished uploading the LaTeX source of the book to the page. I'm going to fire up my bot, and see if I can fix most of the formatting issues. It's probably going to take a few passes with the bot to get it into a reasonable condition, and then we are going to need to go over it by hand to make sure that there aren't any residual problems left. I don't know how long my bot is going to take, but I should be done (or mostly done) before the day is over. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:37, 12 March 2008 (UTC)

:I've seen some of your edits, and I've been trying to make my own as well. I'm going to go through all the pages and remove the &lt;nowiki&gt;=== Exercise xx ===&lt;/nowiki&gt; headings, and do my best to try and number all the problems, examples, definitions, and lemmas, etc. The big problem with this book is that there was no clear delimiter where the text stopped and the equations began. That's why there are so many missing &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags. Fixing this is typically easy, it's just very repetitive (and I currently don't have an automated way to fix it). Anyway, we're making good progress. If we fix up one or two pages per day each, it will be done in no time. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:32, 14 March 2008 (UTC)

I tried to do a direct substitution, turning all &quot;(&quot; into &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags, and so on. However, that method produces a lot of false positives, and I didn't think it was worthwhile. Plus, we end up with lots of stupid stuff like &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, when what we really need is ''0''. However, if you feel that some kind of substitution like this would be better then the alternative, I will try to find a solution. On a personal note, I'm going to be out of town for 5 days on &quot;business&quot;, so I won't be able to do any more work on this book until next thursday. I will be available by email and possibly here on wiki too, but I won't have the time to do any editing. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:05, 14 March 2008 (UTC)

== [[Linear Algebra]] ==

I'm still trying to do a couple pages each night. As you can probably tell by the 25%, 50%, and 75% tags, I'm generally not able to do things perfectly. A lot of that is because I have a terrible attention span, so I am trying to muscle my way through this boring, tedious work. I'm getting a little bit better with the scripts as I go, but when I try to convert ( ... ) to &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt; ... &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, i find that it creates as many problems as it fixes. I really don't know how to find a good middle ground here, unfortunately. 

Anyway, I'm still working on it, and I'm making progress but it's not perfect. A few pages every day is basically my limit. Let me know if you can think of any solutions to our problems. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:45, 25 March 2008 (UTC)

:I know you are away for a while, So I don't expect you are going to get this message any time soon. I have been doing a lot of work on my editing bot, and I've added a few features that I think are going to help speed along the Linear Algebra book fixing. I haven't been working on a page or two per day lately like I have intended. School has kept me very busy. I do hope to get back to work on it ASAP, however, so hopefully there will be some good progress made by the time you return. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:28, 6 April 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Horn clauses==
In this subsection we introduce a special class of formulae which are
of particular  interest for logic programming. Furthermore it turns out that
these formulae admit an efficient test for satisfiability.

==Definition 9==
A formula is a Horn formula if it is in CNF and
every disjunction contains at most one positive literal.
Horn clauses are clauses, which contain at most one positive literal.

&lt;math&gt;F = (A \lor \lnot B)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; \land&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;  (\lnot C \lor \lnot A \lor D) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\land (\lnot A \lor \lnot B)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; \land&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;  D \land \lnot E &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F \equiv  (B \to A)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; \land &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; (C \land A \to D) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \land (A \land B \to false)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; \land &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; (true \to D)\land (E \to false)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;true&lt;/math&gt; is a tautology and &lt;math&gt;false&lt;/math&gt; is an unsatisfiable formula.

In clause form this can be written as 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \{\{ A,\lnot B\}, \{ \lnot C,  \lnot A, D\} , \{\lnot A, \lnot B  \} , \{  D  \},  \{  \lnot E\}\}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and in the context of logic programming this is written as:
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\{  A  \gets B &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;  
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;D  \gets A,C &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\gets A, B&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \gets E &lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;D \gets &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; \}&lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;/center&gt;


For Horn formula there is an efficient algorithm to test
satisfiability of a formula &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; :


{{Box|&lt;center&gt;'''Deciding Satisfiability of Horn Formulae'''&lt;/center&gt;

  
#If there is a subformula of the kind &lt;math&gt; true \to A &lt;/math&gt; label every  occurrence of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
#Apply the following rules until none of them is applicable:&lt;br&gt;       
#*If &lt;math&gt;A_1 \land \cdots \land  A_n \to B&lt;/math&gt; is a subformula and &lt;math&gt;A_1 \cdots  A_n&lt;/math&gt; are all labeled and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is not labeled then label every     occurrence of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt; 
#*If &lt;math&gt;A_1 \land \cdots \land  A_n \to false&lt;/math&gt; is a subformula and &lt;math&gt;A_1 \cdots      A_n&lt;/math&gt; are all labeled then '''Stop: Unsatisfiable''' &lt;br&gt;   
#: 
# '''Stop: Satisfiable'''  The assignment &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}(A) =   true&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is labeled is a model.&lt;br&gt;}}

==Theorem 6 ==
The above algorithm is correct and stops after &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; steps, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; 
is the number of atoms in the formula.

As an immediate consequence we see, that a Horn formula is satisfiable
if there is no subformula of the form &lt;math&gt;A_1 \land \cdots \land A_n \to
false&lt;/math&gt;.

Horn formulae admit unique least models, i.e.  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a unique least model for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;
if for every model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}' &lt;/math&gt; and for every atom B in F holds: if
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}(B) = true&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}'(B) = true&lt;/math&gt; . Note, that this unique least model property does
not hold for non Horn formulae: as an example take &lt;math&gt;A \lor B&lt;/math&gt; which is obviously
non Horn. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_1(A) = true, \mathcal{A}_1(B) = false&lt;/math&gt; is a least model and  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_2(A) =
false, \mathcal{A}_2(B) = true&lt;/math&gt; as well, hence we have two  least models.

==Problems==
====Problem 20 (Propositional)====

Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a propositional logical formulae and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; a subset
atomic formula occurring in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;T_S(F)&lt;/math&gt; be
the formula which results from &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; by replacing all occurrences of an
atomic formulae &lt;math&gt;A \in S&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\lnot A&lt;/math&gt;. Example: &lt;math&gt;T_{\{A\}}(A \land B) = \lnot A \land B&lt;/math&gt;.
Prove or disprove: There exists an &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; for
                      
#&lt;math&gt;F = A \stackrel{\cdot} \vee B&lt;/math&gt; or 
#&lt;math&gt;F = A \stackrel{\cdot} \vee B \stackrel{\cdot} \vee C&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;T_S(F)&lt;/math&gt;  is equivalent to a Horn formula &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;T_S(F) \equiv H&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;
====Problem 21 (Propositional)====

Apply the marking algorithm to the following formula F.

Which is a least  model?
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; (A \lor \lnot D \lor \lnot E) \land (B \lor \lnot C) \land (\lnot B \lor \lnot D) \land D \land (\lnot D \lor E) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

              
#&lt;math&gt;F = (\lnot A \lor \lnot B \lor \lnot C) \land \lnot D \land(\lnot E \lor A) \land E \land B \land (\lnot F \lor C) \land F&lt;/math&gt; 
#&lt;math&gt;F = (A \lor \lnot D \lor \lnot E) \land (B \lor \lnot C) \land (\lnot B \lor \lnot D) \land D \land (\lnot D \lor E) &lt;/math&gt;         
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

====Problem 22 (Propositional)====

Decide which one of the indicated CNFs are Horn formulae and transform then into a conjunction of implications:
  
#&lt;math&gt;(A \lor B \lor C) \land (A \lor \lnot C) \land (\lnot A \lor B) \land \lnot B&lt;/math&gt;             
#&lt;math&gt;(S \lor \lnot P \lor Q) \land (S \lor \lnot P \lor \lnot R)&lt;/math&gt;  
#&lt;math&gt;(A \lor \lnot A)&lt;/math&gt;             
#&lt;math&gt;A \land (\lnot A \lor B) \land (\lnot B \lor \lnot C \lor D) \land (\lnot E) \land (\lnot A \lor \lnot C) \land D&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Resolution==
In this subsection we will develop a calculus for propositional
logic. Until now we have a language, i.e. a set of formulae and we
have investigated into semantics and some properties of formulae or
sets of clauses. Now we will introduce an inference rule, namely the
resolution rule, which allows to derive   new clauses from given ones.

==Definition 10==

A clause &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a resolvent of clauses &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;, if there is a literal &lt;math&gt;L \in C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{L}\in
C_2&lt;/math&gt;  and
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
R= (C_1 - \{L\} ) \cup (C_2 -\{\overline{L}\})
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where  
&lt;math&gt;\overline{L} = 
\begin{cases} 
\;\;\,\lnot A \; \text{  if }  L = A \\
\;\;\,A \; \text{  if }  L = \lnot A
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that there is a special case, if we construct the resolvent out
of two literals, i.e. &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{L}&lt;/math&gt; can be resolved upon
and yield the empty set. This empty resolvent is depicted by the
special symbol &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; denotes an unsatisfiable formula. We define a clause set,
which contains this empty clause to be unsatisfiable,

In the following we investigate in properties of the resolution  rule and the entire calculus. The following Lemma is stating the correctness of one single application of the resolution rule.

==Theorem 7==


If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a set of clauses and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; a resolvent of &lt;math&gt;C_1,C_2 \in 
S&lt;/math&gt;, then
&lt;math&gt;S \equiv S \cup \{R\} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''Proof:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be an assignment for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;; hence it is an
assignment for &lt;math&gt;S \equiv S \cup \{R\}&lt;/math&gt; as well.
Assume &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \models S&lt;/math&gt;: hence for all clauses &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, we have
that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \models C&lt;/math&gt;. The resolvent &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; looks
like:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
R= (C_1 - \{L\} ) \cup (C_2 -\{\overline{L}\})
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;L\in C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{L} \in C_2&lt;/math&gt;. Now there are two
cases:
  
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \models L&lt;/math&gt;: From   &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \models C_2&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \not\models  \overline{L}&lt;/math&gt;, we conclude  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \models (C_2  -\{\overline{L}\})&lt;/math&gt; and   hence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \models R&lt;/math&gt;. 
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \not \models L&lt;/math&gt;: From   &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \models C_1&lt;/math&gt; we conclude  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \models (C_1   -\{L\})&lt;/math&gt; and   hence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \models R&lt;/math&gt;. The opposite direction of the lemma is obvious.

==Definition 11==

Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be s set of clauses and
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; Res(S) = S \cup \{ R \mid R \text{ is a resolvent of two clauses in }  
S\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
then

&lt;math&gt;Res^0(S)    =  S&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Res^{n+1}(S) =  Res(Res^n(S)), n\geq  0 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Res^*(S)    =  \bigcup_{n\geq 0} Res^n(S)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

If we understand the process of iterating the Res-operator as a procedure for deriving new clauses from a given set, and in particular to derive possibly the empty clause, we have to ask, under which circumstances we get the empty clause, and vice versa, what does it mean if we get it. These properties are investigates in the following two Theorems.

==Theorem 8 (Correctness)==
Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a set of clauses. If &lt;math&gt;\square \in Res^*(S)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;
is unsatisfiable.

'''Proof:''' From &lt;math&gt;\square \in Res^*(S)&lt;/math&gt; we conclude, that &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; 
is obtained by resolution from  two clauses &lt;math&gt;C_1 = \{L\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2 =
\{\overline{L}  \}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence there is a &lt;math&gt;\exists n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt;\square \in Res^n(S)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_1, C_2 \in Res^n(S)&lt;/math&gt; and therefore 
&lt;math&gt;Res^n(S)&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable. From Theorem (resolution-lemma) we
conclude that &lt;math&gt;Res^n(S) \equiv S&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable.

==Theorem 9 (Completeness)==

Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a ''finite''  set of clauses. If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable 
then  &lt;math&gt;\square \in Res^*(S)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:''' Induction over the number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of atomic formulae in
&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.
With &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt; we have  &lt;math&gt;S = \{ \square\} &lt;/math&gt;and hence &lt;math&gt;\square \in S \subseteq
Res^*(S)&lt;/math&gt;.

Assume &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; fixed and for every unsatisfiable set of clauses &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; atomic formulae &lt;math&gt;A_1, \cdots , A_n&lt;/math&gt; it holds that  &lt;math&gt;\square
\in Res^*(S)&lt;/math&gt;.

Assume a set of clauses &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with atomic formulae  &lt;math&gt;A_1, \cdots
,A_n,A_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;. In the following we construct two clause sets &lt;math&gt;S_f&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;S_t&lt;/math&gt;:
  
*&lt;math&gt;S_f&lt;/math&gt; is received from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; by deleting every occurrence of   &lt;math&gt;A_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; in a clause and by deleting every clause which contains an occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\lnot A_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;. This transformation obviously corresponds to interpreting the atom   &lt;math&gt;A_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;false&lt;/math&gt;, 
*&lt;math&gt;S_t&lt;/math&gt; results from a similar transformation, where occurrences   of  &lt;math&gt;\lnot A_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; and clauses containing   &lt;math&gt;A_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; are deleted, hence  &lt;math&gt;A_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted with &lt;math&gt;true&lt;/math&gt;. 

Let us show, that both &lt;math&gt;S_f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_t&lt;/math&gt; are unsatisfiable: Assume an
assignment &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;  for the atomic formale &lt;math&gt;\{ A_1, \cdots, A_n\}&lt;/math&gt;  which is a
model for &lt;math&gt;S_f&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the assignment 
&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A}'(B) = 
\begin{cases}
\;\;\, \mathcal{A}(B) \; \text { if } B \in \{ A_1, \cdots, A_n\} \\  
\;\;\, false \text{ if }  B = A_{n+1}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
is a model for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, which leads to a contradiction. A similar
construction shows that &lt;math&gt;S_t&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable. Hence then we can use
the induction assumption to conclude that  &lt;math&gt;\square \in Res^*(S_t)&lt;/math&gt;
and  &lt;math&gt;\square \in Res^*(S_f)&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence there is a sequence of clauses
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
C_1, \cdots , C_m = \square
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt;\forall 1 \leq i \leq m &lt;/math&gt; it holds &lt;math&gt;C_i \in S_f&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; is a
resolvent of two clauses &lt;math&gt;C_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_b&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a,b &lt; i&lt;/math&gt;.There is
an analog sequence for &lt;math&gt;S_t&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
C_1', \cdots , C_t' = \square
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now we are going to reintroduce the previously deleted literals
&lt;math&gt;A_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot A_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; in the two sequences:
  
*Clause &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; which has been the result of deleting   &lt;math&gt;A_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; from  the original clause in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are again  modified to &lt;math&gt;C_i \cup \{A_n+1\} &lt;/math&gt;. This results in a sequence  &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \overline{C_1}, \cdots , \overline{ C_m}&lt;/math&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt;\overline{ C_m}&lt;/math&gt; is either &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;A_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;. 
*Analogous we introduce &lt;math&gt; \lnot A_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; in the second sequence, such that &lt;math&gt;\overline{ C_t'}&lt;/math&gt;  is either &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lnot A_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; 
In any of the above  cases we get  &lt;math&gt;\square \in Res^*(S)&lt;/math&gt; latest after one
resolution step with   &lt;math&gt;\overline{ C_m}&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\overline{ C_t'}&lt;/math&gt;.



Based on the   theorems for correctness and completeness,  we give a
procedure for deciding the  satisfiability of propositional formulae.

{{Box|&lt;center&gt;'''Deciding Satisfiability of Propositional Formulae'''&lt;/center&gt; 

Given a propositional formula &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.
  
*Transform &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; into an equivalent CNF &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. 
*Compute &lt;math&gt;Res^n(S)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; n = 0,1,2, \cdots &lt;/math&gt;         
**If &lt;math&gt;\square \in Res^n(S)&lt;/math&gt; then '''Stop: unsatisfiable''' . 
**if &lt;math&gt; Res^n(S) = Res^{n+1}(S)&lt;/math&gt; then '''Stop: satisfiable''' .     
*: }}

==Theorem 10==


If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of clauses, then there exists a &lt;math&gt;k \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; 
such that
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;Res^k(S) = Res^{k+1}(S)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Until now, we have been dealing with sets of clauses. 
In the following it will turn out, that it is helpful to talk about
sequences of applications of the resolution rule.

==Definition 12==


A deduction of a clause &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; from a set of clauses
&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence &lt;math&gt; C_1, \cdots, C_n&lt;/math&gt;, such that 
  
*&lt;math&gt;C_n = C&lt;/math&gt; and 
*&lt;math&gt;\forall 1 \leq i \leq n : ( C_i \in S \text{ or }  \exists l,r &lt; i : C_i   \text{ is a resolvent of  }  C_l = and = C_r)&lt;/math&gt;  


A deduction of the empty clause &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is called a 
refutation of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Example'''
We want to show, that the formula &lt;math&gt; K = ((B \land \lnot A) \lor C)&lt;/math&gt; is a logical
consequence of &lt;math&gt;F = ( (A \lor (B \lor C)) \land (C \lor \lnot A))&lt;/math&gt;. For this
negate &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and prove the unsatisfiability of &lt;math&gt; F \land \lnot K&lt;/math&gt; 

For this you can use the interaction in this book in various forms:
  
*Use the interaction Truth Tables for proving the unsatisfiability, or 
*use the  interaction CNF Transformation for transforming   the formula into CNF, and then  
*use the following interaction Resolution.


==Problems==
====Problem 23 (Propositional)====
Compute &lt;math&gt;Res^n(M)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Res^*(M)&lt;/math&gt; for the following set of clauses:
              
#&lt;math&gt;M = \{\{A\}, \{B\}, \{\lnot A,C\},\{B,\lnot C,\lnot D\}, \{\lnot C,D\},\{\lnot D\}&lt;/math&gt; 
#&lt;math&gt;M = \{\{A,\lnot B\},\{A,B\},\{\lnot A\}\}&lt;/math&gt;             
#&lt;math&gt;M = \{\{A,B,C\},\{\lnot B,\lnot C\},\{\lnot A,C\}\}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

====Problem 29 (Propositional)====
Show by using the resolution rule, that &lt;math&gt;\lnot A \land \lnot B \land C&lt;/math&gt;
is an inference from the set of clauses &lt;math&gt;F = \{ \{A, C\}, \{\lnot B, \lnot C\}, \{\lnot A\} \}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

====Problem 30 (Propositional)====
Show by using the resolution rule, that &lt;math&gt;((P \to Q \text{ is }) \land P ) \to Q&lt;/math&gt; is a tautology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;created using [[User:Whiteknight/Page Nav Header]], contact [[User talk:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] for details.&lt;/div&gt;

This navigation template adds a page to [[:Category:{{{book|User:Whiteknight}}}]].

== Creating This Template ==
To create a page header template using this design, go to the template page and type:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{subst:User:Whiteknight/Page Nav Header|book=&lt;&lt;BOOKNAME&gt;&gt;}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Where &lt;&lt;BOOKNAME&gt;&gt; is the title of your book. Click &quot;'''Save page'''&quot; to create the template. This will substitute in all the necessary code and text. 

=== Options ===

You can customize the CSS style of the template by adding a style argument:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{subst:User:Whiteknight/Page Nav Header|book=&lt;&lt;BOOKNAME&gt;&gt;|style=&lt;&lt;STYLE&gt;&gt;}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

If you add this style parameter, it will override all the default styles from the template. The default style, which you may want to duplicate in whole or in part, is:

 width:90%; clear:both; padding:5px; margin:5px auto;

== Using This Template ==

To use this template in your book, use regular template syntax to include it at the top of every page. This template takes two arguments, both of which are unnamed. The first argument is the name of the previous subpage, and the second argument is the name of the next subpage. page names are automatically prepended with the name of the book. This means that you cannot use this template to navigate to pages in other books.

&quot;The best lesson plans are never finished; rather, they are organic to accommodate an ever-changing classroom environment.&quot;  Pam Stephens, ''Lesson Plan Writing,'' November 2005,''' &lt;u&gt;SchoolArts&lt;/u&gt;'''
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

----
===&lt;big&gt;'''What Is A Lesson Plan and Why Is It Important?'''&lt;/big&gt;===
A lesson plan is a well thought-out plan of what material is to be covered and how it is to be taught to the students by the teacher for the school year.  It is a plan that the teacher has developed according to the curriculum and includes the Virginia Standards of Learning Pacing Guidelines.  These plans can be designed on an individual basis, but are best when there is a collaborative groups of teachers in the same school who are teaching at the same grade level plotting their goals for the academic year.  This is so all classes of this grade will be on the same page throughout the year.  

Can you image walking into a class of first graders with no plan?  Lesson plans not only remind the teacher where they are in the curriculum, but also help to keep them on track so that all of the vital educational material is covered in the school year.  Teachers do not ever want to arrive at school without a prepared plan for their class for the day.  Lesson Plans are sometimes part of the teaching job that teachers do not enjoy preparing, but after they have accomplished this task they are thankful for the guidance it provides them with each day in their classrooms.  It is a tedious and daunting task, but with today's technology aides and the help of first-year teacher mentors, the job seems less challenging.

===&lt;big&gt;'''Let's Talk About What Are The Ingredients Of A Lesson Plan'''&lt;/big&gt;===
In the book Bringing Learning Alive! by The Teachers' Curriculum Institute of Palo Alto, California, it states that there are five rules to planning your course with lesson plans:

(1)  Know the standards, essential content, skills, and objectives that must be taught.

(2)  Gather a wealth of rich resources -- visual images, music, readings, activity ideas--to make the content more accessible for students.

(3)  Collaborate with their fellow teachers to generate or review new ideas about the course.

(4)  Plan a realistic master course calendar, making the difficult content choices to ensure that the units they choose are taught thoroughly.

(5)  Create a final semester or course assessment that both prepares students for any mandatory standardized testing and also allows students to show what they know about major themes and key standards (Maloney, p.221).

As you can see, the number one item is to know what the curriculum and state requirements are first.  Then you can establish your subject matter and divide it into &quot;chunks&quot; or pieces of the pie to determine what you can realistically teach the students well versus how much of the material you can just cover.

&quot;Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.&quot;  --William Butler Yeats
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Begin with your school calendar and count up your exact number of teaching days.  This is important when planning your lesson plans, because the calendar will include non-instructional days such as staff development days, testing days, and particularly in high school the days when there are club meetings or pep rallies.  These days must be considered, or you will find out that you have short-changed your time in your lesson plans and can not cover the necessary data.

Number two is probably one of the most fun parts of the lesson, and that is collecting the resources to provide your students with a visual such as a video segment, a map, a movie, or transparencies on the over-head projector.

Getting together with the other teachers in number three can be such an eye-opener especially for new teachers.  It is very important for elementary teachers of the same grade to get together and discuss their lesson plans and all be working towards the same goals at the same time.  An example of this could be teachers introducing poems to the students and the art, music, or even physical education teachers are aware of this and can introduce rhythming songs to sing in music or when jumping rope and even drawing pictures to illustrate a poem could all be integrated during this lesson.

Number four reminds teacher to not over-plan and be realistic with their lesson plans.  The teacher must remember to design the lesson around an essential element or question that is the whole meaning of learning the lesson to begin with.  The lesson must interest the students and even though not all students are stimulated the same way, the teacher must understand this and find the best methods to make the material interesting to all students.  There is a wealth of new technologies such as www.unitedstreaming.com which is a website that brings videos straight into the classroom along with providing data sheets for the students along with lesson plans for the teachers.  Make the lesson stimulating and the students will enjoy it and learn.

Last, according to the Teachers' Curriculum Institute prepare the students for the assessment tests of all your lessons for the week or for the year.  Make sure that your testing will be a good reflection of the state SOL testing.  Another idea here is to allow the student to rate or give feed-back about which lessons they found most interesting during the year and whatever feedback they wish to include about how to change the way something was taught to them during the school year.

===&lt;big&gt;'''Free Internet Lesson Plans'''&lt;/big&gt;===
In the January/February 2006 issue of &quot;The Social Studies&quot; Journal, there is a wonderful article about designing a lesson plan to shatter stereotypes.  This article talks about the problems of attitudes and behavior toward minority groups especially since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  This article includes a free lesson plan for teachers who wish to incorporate this subject into their curriculum.  This is the description of the lesson it will teach:

&quot;The lesson plan could be part of a larger unit plan dealing with prejudice, discrimination, and racism in American or world history.  It could also be used in government, civics, and sociology courses.  The activities will help students understand the dangerous consequences that stereotypes have had in history, improve their knowledge of minority groups, and develop strategies for combating prejudice and discrimination&quot; (Moore, 2006).

There are many websites with free lesson plans and there are also some websites you can join and get a membership so that you can access the plans.  Here is a same list of the ones that are highly recommended:

Google For Educators @ http://www.google.com/educators/index.html
LessonPlanZ @ http://www.lessonplanz.com/
WELCOME to A to Z Teacher Stuff @ http://atozteacherstuff.com/
PBS Teachers @ http://www.pbs.org/teachers/

According to an article in an edition of ''Current Events, a Weekly Reader publication,'' here are some activites to include in your lesson plans that are sure to get the attention of your students:  examine editorial cartoons, analyze photos, debate it, map it, chart it, graph it (Weekly Reader, 2007).  All of these will spark your students' creativity and interest.

===&lt;big&gt;'''Field Trip Lesson Plans'''&lt;/big&gt;===
Do you think that you should have a lesson plan for a field trip?  Of course you do, this is so that you can relate the material that you have covered in class to what the students are seeing while on the field trip.  

James Kisiel has written an article for the ''Science Activities'' Journal entitled &quot;More than Lions and Tigers and Bears-Creating Meaningful Field Trip Lessons,&quot; and it a complete lesson plan with the information for the teacher of how to go about making a field trip connect to the curriculum.  His essential question is &quot;What Makes a Mammal?&quot; and he is taking his students to a museum.  Mr. Kisiel states:  &quot;The approach of a field trip-based unit involves the use of the ''learning cycle'' model (Barman and Kotar 1989; Barman 1989).  The observations and experiences of the ''exploration phase'', in which students play an active role in examining the animal exhibits and gathering information, are given additional meaning through the ''concept introduction phase'', in which the teacher plays a more active role in connecting student experiences to particular concepts, such as habitat, mammal, or adaptation.  The ''concept application phase'' allows students to test their new ideas by introducing a new situation and asking students to relate their developing ideas and concepts to that new situation&quot; (Kisiel, 2006).

The entire field trip lesson plans can be found in this article by James Kisiel who is the assistant professor of science education at California State University at this website:  &lt;http://find.galegroup.com.ezproxy.vccs.edu:2048/itx/infomark.do?&amp;contentSet=IAC-Documents&amp;type=retrieve&amp;tabID=T002&amp;prodId=AONE&amp;docId=A148006094&amp;source=gale&amp;srcprod=AONE&amp;userGroupName=viva2_vccs&amp;version=1.0&gt;.

==&lt;big&gt;'''All Teachers Need Lesson Plans'''&lt;/big&gt;==

All teachers need lesson plans from preschool to college and beyond.  Aristotle said we are all goal oriented and Socrates said we all want happiness.  Teachers can achieve their goals and find happiness through the joys of having good working lesson plans.

In their article, ''Ensuring Lessons Teach the Curriculum with a Lesson Plan Resource,'' Heddi Craft and Paul D. Bland make this comparison about teachers and how they teach:  &quot;Some teachers are like chefs and they serve their student the same basic &quot;recipes&quot; year after year.  These lessons often are tasy and effective, familiar standbys that are relied on and enjoyed.  Other teachers are like experimental chefs, never content to use the same recipe for instruction twice, always looking to try new ingredients and styles&quot; (Craft, 2003).

Think about teaching as serving your students a meal.  Wouldn't you get tried of eating the same thing over and over again.  Variety of resources and teaching styles will keep your students attentive and learning.

===&lt;big&gt;'''Essay Response'''&lt;/big&gt;===

Sample Essay Response by Victoria (Viki) B. Wilson

The best lesson plan is the plan that is constantly evolving each time the lesson is taught or even during the teaching of the lesson the plan can change by shrinking or expanding. Teachers need to be very flexible with the content and the resources while retaining the curriculum element that is the driving force. An example of this could be that while teaching the subject of electricity, the class and the school is out due to bad weather and the lesson must be cut short to accommodate this shortage of time. The teacher would extract from the lesson a couple of experiments or presentations that would have been great extras if the time had allowed. The material that is subtracted must not take away from the message and necessities of the entire lesson, only the extra reinforcing the data would have provided if the time had been as planned. Lesson plans are just plans, they are not written in stone! All plans, no matter if they are for vacations or for teaching should have lots of flexibility and spontaneity for whatever situations occur. These plans even if never changed from the first time they are taught, should be reevaluated on a regular basis to make sure the content and the structure or time frame should change or not change according to the changes of the day. World events can easily change lessons when comparing history with current events. Science changes daily and some science projects that have previously been used in lesson plans may need tweaking from time to time. Teachers should always be seeking to improve their lessons, and this is why along with current events of the world lesson plans should never become stagnant. To teach is a gift, the students receive a gift in learning and the teacher receives one in teaching. Lesson plans make a teacher's day better!

Thanks --[[User:84.190.64.20|84.190.64.20]] 18:35, 29 May 2007 (UTC)

:Done. For reference, a &quot;stick&quot; is a North American term for ¼ pound of butter. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:46, 29 May 2007 (UTC)

== Shouldn't this be a base recipe? ==

I would assume the simple Hollandaise title would start with the base recipe, and become more complex from there. Here is a very simple Hollandaise sauce recipe.
----
&lt;pre&gt;
3 egg yolks
1 tablespoon / 18.25 g / 15 ml lemon juice
1/2 cup / 115 g / 120 ml firm salted butter (cold)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;With double boiler:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Stir yolks and lemon juice vigorously in top of double boiler. Add half of the butter, and place on stove over medium heat, bringing the water to a steady boil. Stirring constantly, melt the butter completely. Add second half of butter and melt as before, stirring constantly. Continue cooking over boiling water, stirring vigorously, until the yolks cook and the sauce thickens.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;In 1.5 l/qt sauce pan:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Stir yolks and lemon juice vigorously in sauce pan. Add half of the cold/firm butter, and place on stove over very low heat. Stir constantly and melt the butter completely. Add remaining butter and melt as before, stirring vigorously, until the yolks cook and the sauce thickens.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;

(Be sure the butter melts slowly so the yolks have time to cook and thicken the sauce without curdling.) Serve either hot or room temperature, possibly garnish with a dash of Hungarian paprika.

The seven wonders of the ancient world are seven man-made structures around the rim of the Mediterranean Sea that have been widely considered to be extraordinary feats of human engineering and design. While the commonly-accepted list of wonders focuses on the Mediterranean area, there are certainly many other wonderful and extraordinary structures from other parts of the world that the writers of this list were likely not familiar with.

This book discusses the classical seven wonders of the ancient world, including their construction, life, and destruction.

This chapter explains the '''automation''' features of Usenet Explorer.
==Associate a Watch Filter with a Newsgroup==

By associating a Watch Filter with a Newsgroup, you can automatically download attachments of headers that match a filter.

# open the '''Properties''' window (Edit &gt; Properties or F5), select the '''Watch/Auto headers''' tab
# in the '''Available watch filters''' pane, select the watch filter
# in the '''Newsgroup(s)/Folder pane''', select the newsgroup or folder
# click the '''Add''' button; the filter will show up in the '''Watch filters''' pane
# specify the directory to save the attachments to using the '''Browse''' or '''Default''' buttons

Now, if headers are downloaded that match the filter, the attachments in the bodies of the messages are saved automatically.  Each time new headers are downloaded, additional parts of the attachments are downloaded and saved.  There's no need to wait for a posting to complete uploading; it is downloaded automatically when it appears on your news servers.

== Blocked from editing ==

You have been blocked from editing Wikibooks for one week.  The reason for this block is because of the continued addition of misleading information to Wikibook Cookbook articles.  I warned you to stop but you didn't listen to my warning and made further misleading changes.  After your block has expired you may return but only if you are going to help the Wikibooks community rather than vandalise it.

==audio files==
 
HI If you want to learn spoken Latin some of the wide range of lessons on 
the Latinum podcast are aimed at this: Have a look at http://latinum.mypodcast.com

==code switching trick==
Here is a trick you can use to learn both basic grammar and to get into the hang of speaking in Latin.  One of the biggest problems for students who learn Latin is the fact that it is not a word order language.  This fact has already been covered in other lessons but the trick presented here is designed to get you past word order thinking and to start producing Latin in your head so it can come out of your mouth or off of your pen.  Please note that if you don`t have enough vocabulary to produce a real sentence in Latin with out looking up every word you can still use this trick to get yourself used to speaking in this way but using English words that you will slowly replace as your Latin vocabulary grows.  

I'd not use this method for more than a day or so. But playing around with it will help a little. Nothing will really work, except for working and studying Latin itself, in Latin.

Of course if you have studied the proper endings for a word then you should use it but if not just keep the English pronouns He, His, Him in you mind.  Using these in English it is possible to violate English strict word order and still create an intelligible sentence.  

:He to her its them gives.

Of course this is not good English and we don`t know what the pronouns are referring to but we can still understand and that is the whole point.  Using pronouns in English we can violate word order and even leave it behind.  The interesting thing about Latin is that it isn`t just the Pronouns but every word with few exceptions that can do this.  

This is what you do.  Any word, from any language can be latinized and used in a pseudo language that will teach you to speak Latin if you stick with it.  

Subject of a sentence: do nothing to the word but keep in mind that you can actually drop it from the sentence if everyone already knows what you are talking about.

Possesive: add an `IS` to the end of the word, so instead of car`s, you will have caris.

Indirect object: add `i` to the end.  This will sound funny but will work.  If a word end in an ee kind of sound just pronounce it twice.

Direct object: add `EM` to the end of a word.  thus you get things like flowerem, spacem, computerem, carem, personem  and so on.  

If you need to use a preposition just use the prepositions you have learned and don`t change the word (just use the subject form as the preposition tell you the grammar of the word)

Thus you could say a sentence like;
:boy girli manis flowerem gives

The above sentence is not English, nor Latin but it is what is called Code Switching and anyone who is on the way to fluency in a second language does it automatically.  That is why is Japan people go around saying things like 

Car WA Boy OH Hit imasu.

We don`t understand this sentence but it again is what may happen when two languages mix in the brain.  Code Switcing is an important step to really becoming efficient in a new language.  It allows you to move past only translation and actually make words come out of your mouth.  

Note; when you practice this trick don`t worry about the plurals till you really study them.

Anyone who has studied Latin even a little probably knows the beginnings of the conjugation for 
:amo, amas, amat
What you should take note of is the fact that where the second person in Latin is governed by an S at the end and the third by a T it is reversed in English.

:I love, thou lovest, he loves

So this is what you do to start adding Verbs to your new Latin Code Switching hack; flip what you would normally say for HE from S to T at the end and start using S for the You form.

: I love, you loves, he lovet

Yes, It looks strange but it is to help you learn to code switch.  Again, don`t use plurals till you really learn them and have already gotten used to useing the singulars here.  When you learn the correct Latin Vocabulary then replace the English words for the correct Latin words with correct Latin endings for that particular word.  

As a final step before really forcing yourself into creating all Latin sentences, start using either an `M` or an `I` after verbs that are in the first person

:I lovem, I lovei

This will be important when you learn the perfect tense.  Then start dropping the I, we, you, them pronouns all together.  You will find that you don`t need them since the verb tells you who is doing the action of the verb.  Still use He and she as the difference from Male and Female is more important in Latin then in English.  

Your resulting sentences should be something like this when spoken

:boy girli manis flowerem givet.

Don`t write in this code.  This should be used only for spoken exercises.  Get a friend and both of you learn this code and just speak back and forth.  Keep it simple.  Don`t try anything too complicated till you actually learn it.  Try to make it sound nice as well, Latin was a fluid, beautiful language that gave use the romance of French and Italian so giving yourself a little accent can`t hurt.  

Another tip is to put the verb at the end of the sentence.  The reason is that this creates a spoken period.  Because we don`t have word order to tell us when the sentence ends anymore, by putting the verb, which every sentence must have, at the end you are also telling the other person that the sentence is coming to an end.  To make a question you can still put the verb at the end and just make it sound like a question or use a prober Latin question creator when you learn it.  

Here is an example of a conversation in this code

:computerem uses?
::yes. use wants?
:dog momis computerem broket.
::really, terrible ist.
:mom around house dogem chaset
::funny soundt
:say, girlis from computer class numberem gets?
::no, she tall guyem liket
:dark hairem she liket?
::Maybe, not knowi
:heris numberem get tryi

Yes, silly conversation, but this is just to give you an example of how to start breaking word order grammar and get into the mindset of the inflexive Latin grammar.  Once you learn the proper endings start applying them to your English words.  When you learn the proper vocabulary then switch to using the Latin words.  When you learn a new Verb ending for past tense, infinitive and what not then start practicing with this new ending till you got it down, and not just with Latin words but with English Code Switching.  You will be able to speak intelligible, near fluent Latin in less then Five Months.


Once you actually do get some real Latin vocabulary under your belt you should start paying attention to the grave marks.  Macrons can help you to tell the difference in words in their written form but really doesn`t help with speaking.  Find a book or article in the net that shows the little accent markes that are sometimes called graves and sometimes called Breves.
They look like just a little slash over a vowel.  é é à  and the like.  These tell you what part of the word to sort of choke up on.  Try saying the word Spaghetti.  You automatically want to choke up or STRESS the E sound in the middle.  You actually say this `spaghétti`.  Not all words have a stressed sound in them but many do and it can give you a great way to really sound Latin.  All in all they are really helpfull.

Many speakers of Latin will change a C to a CH if it is followed by a E or I vowel sound.  You don`t have to do this and many people that teach Classical Latin say it is wrong but if you are speaking Latin today it really is by definition Not Classical Latin.  Doing this will get you saying the word in a very European kind of pronunciation that really seems very natural and makes some words easier to say.  Again, you don`t have to do it and really shouldn`t if it makes your teacher angry.  Similar to changing the C to CH is the use of changing a G sound to a J sound if again followed by an E or an I sound.  
:thus   Ge-nu  becomes `jen-u   as in the modern genuflect.
:: Civitas- Kee vee tas becomes Chee vee tas which eventually came to be See vee tas- so that we can say civics and citizen.
The last point of consern is to choose to use the letter V as a v,v,v,v,v,v,v sound or a W,W,W,W,W,W sound.  Once you pick it is best to stay consistent and not change from one word to another.  If you don`t like the way it is going with one and want to change to the other then change all words to the new way of saying them.

==sentence patterns==

Once you have played around with the language a bit you will want to start putting things in order the way they should be in Latin.  Now, it is true that Latin does not have a specificly set Word Order, but there is a usual order that sentences tend to go in.  This does not mean that they HAVE TO go in this order, it just is the common way.  The word order, it should be remembered, has ZERO relation to the grammatical meaning of a word.  Regardless of word order the sentence will mean the EXACT same thing.  However the normal word order goes something like this.

Nominative Dative Accusative Ablatives/adverbs Verbs.

Put into modern English language grammatical terms this translates into something like this.

Subject IndirectObject DirectObject Compliments verbs.

Please note, the verb is usually last.  It does not have to be, but just usually is.  The subject (nominative) is usually first but does not have to be and an interesting feature of Latin is that the Subject can be dropped anytime it is understood.  Many sentences in Latin actually wind up being DirectObject Verb.  

The reason most teacher teach the declention list in a certain order N-G-D-Ac-Ab is because of this normal Latin word order even if they do not realize it.  

Most Latin sentences will not contain every case.  Latin has a number of sentence patterns and these patterns deturmine what cases are needed and what those cases mean.

The most basic sentence pattern in latin is  '''Nominative Esse'''.  For this sentence pattern you basically put your noun in the nominative case and put the correct form of the &quot;be&quot; verb Esse after it.  

Examples:
Homo sum.  Mulier es.   Umbella est.  Pueri sumus.   Puellae estis.    Furnaces sunt.

Make sure you match singulars with singular verbs and plurals with plural verbs.  

The next sentence pattern in complexity is Nominative '''Nominative Esse'''.  This basically says that you are equating the first thing with the second thing.  This pattern is also used to place the qualities of an adjective on a noun.  All that really matters is that they are both in the nominative.  Make sure they match in gender.

Pater homo est.  Amicae mulieres sunt.    Magister bonevolus est.    Magistra irata est.   Nauta bonus est.  Manus dextra est.

These last two sentence patterns were pretty easy and strait forward, you just have to remember not to put the &quot;be&quot; verb in the middle but even if you do it is still correct Latin.  It just sounds better to put the verb at the end.  The next sentence patter isn't so hard but since we don't really have it in English  it can throw some.

'''Nominative Dative Esse'''.  This is where you state that a thing is &quot;for&quot; a person.  &quot;The book is for him&quot; and the like.  English doesn't really have a Dative case anymore so the idea is a bit out there but datives come up all the time in Latin so it is time to start getting used them.

Liber puero est.   Mulier homini est.  Homo mulieri est.  (Nominative dropped) Mihi est.  Tibi est.  

At this point in time it is appropriate to mention the Genitive case.  You will notice even though most of your books state that the Genitive case is the possessor case similar to English &quot;His&quot; &quot;Her&quot; &quot;Its&quot; &quot;Their&quot;, it was not used for that purpose above.  In Latin the Genitive case is a quasi-adjective that states an internal quality of the noun.  Take a look at the difference.

Puer mulieri est.  Puer irae est.  

I can say &quot;the boy is for the woman / He is the woman's son&quot; but I can't say &quot;the boy is for anger.&quot;  That makes no sense.  But I can say &quot;He is a boy of anger.&quot;  This gives you the impression that the boy is just angry all the time.  Datives used with the Esse verb tend to be PEOPLE, not objects.  Genitives used with the ESSE verb tend to be objects but can often be people.  Here is the difference.

Filius homini est.        The very point of this sentence is to tell you that the Son is for the Man.  
Filius hominis nauta est. This sentence uses a Genitive because the point the sentence exist is not to tell us that the Son is for the Man but that the Son is a Sailor.  The fact that he is the Man's Son is just an extra idea that we threw on but could easily take off and still have the meaning of the sentence preserved.
Filius nauta est.  Filius himinis nauta est.

Basically, for grammar, we will treat the genitive like an indeclinable adjective.  It can go anyplace an adjective can go.

The next sentence pattern we will look at is '''Nominative Adverb est'''.  You basically state a nominative and give extra information about it using an adverb,or a preposition plus case noun.  

Petasus illic est.
Petasus in mensa est.

With Intransitive and Transitive verbs we can use adverbs, prepositional phrases and Ablatives by themselves for this.

Bene video.
In via sto.
Placido quiesco.

This means that you know already know another sentence pattern.  '''Nominative Adverb Intransative Verb'''.


Once we jump into the world of transitive verbs you will have a bit more in the sentence to keep track of.  A transitive verb allows an Actor (subject nominative) to act (transitive verb) on an object (Accusative).  The sentence pattern goes like this: '''Nominative Accusative Transative Verb'''.

In English we use word order to separate these two because unless we use a pronoun like HIM, the subject and object of the sentence will look the same.  Not in Latin, or at least not often in Latin.  In Latin, Sujects sound and thus look different than Objects.  Keep in mind that word order could be any order But so that you can see and get used to what you are seeing I will stick to Nominative Accusative Verb.  In a real Latin sentence, multiple adjetive/genitives, adverbs/ablatives and or datives may be in a sentence to extend and enhance the meaning.  

Puella puerum videt.  See, even with Puer and Puella being next to each other and them being similar in pronunciation, you can still easily deturmine who is the subject and who is the object.

Pueri puellas cum intentissime observant.
No mystery here as to what is going on I hope.  

Next we will look at giving verbs.  Their sentence pattern goes like this: '''Nominative Dative Accusative Verb'''. Nominative gives Accsative to Dative.  If you can understand that then this sentence pattern is easy.

Puella puero rosam dat.
Puer puellae cephalalgiam dat. 
Mulier hominibus litteras misit.

You will notice I hope that I used the verb Dat twice above.  The Dative does indeed take its name from its frequent use with this verb.  Also I used the verb Misit.  Any verb that means &quot;give&quot; &quot;send&quot; &quot;grant&quot; and the like can logically use this construction. 

Next we look at Making verbs.  This is where you say that you turned one thing into another thing.  This can be a noun into another noun or a noun into an adjective. '''Nominative Accusative Accusative Verb'''.

Coquus similaginem crustulum fecit.
Coquus crustulum dulce fecit.

The last of the most basic sentence patterns that you will need to remember and use in everyday speach is '''Nominative Ab Ablative Passive Verb'''.  In this sentence the Nominative Case is not the actor of the verb but instead recieves the action that the verb gives, just like a passive verb in English.  Logically, there can be no Accusative in this kind of sentence.  The person that is the ACTOR does not have to be stated but if he or she is it will be using the Ablative case after the preposition Ab.  

Ab familia mea laudar.  
circenses ab omnibus videntur.

Those sentence patterns listed above are the most basic and most frequent sentence patterns that you will encounter and have to use is you become a Latin speaker (and you should be trying to become a Latin speaker).  These sentence patterns are your base and onto them you will eventually add additional sub patterns that you will use.  The important thing is to master these simple patterns first and then move on to more complex structures.  Once you know the pattern, it become just a patter of vocabulary replacement.  Move one word out and put in the desired next word.  You should know how to do this through repetition so much that you do not have to think about it to parse or translate.  The goal is to understand in Latin and not have to need to translate into English to get it.</text>

==What are Roots?==

''Roots'' are the inverse operation for exponents. An expression with roots is called a '''radical expression'''. It's easy, although perhaps tedious, to compute exponents given a root.  For instance 7*7*7*7 = 49*49 = 2401.  So, we know the fourth root of 2401 is 7, and the square root of 2401 is 49.  What is the third root of 2401?  This [[w:nth_root_algorithm|article]] gives a formula for determining the answer, while this [[w:nth_root|article]] gives a detailed explanation of roots.  

Finding the value for a particular root is difficult.  This is because exponentiation is a different kind of function than addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  When we graph functions we will see that expressions that use exponentiation use curves instead of lines.  We will see using algebra that not all of these expression are functions, that knowing when an expression is a relation or a function can allow us to make certain types of assumptions, and we can use these assumptions to build mental models for topics that would otherwise be impossible to understand.

For now we will deal with roots by turning them back into exponents.

If a root is defined as the nth root of X, it is represented as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{x} = r&lt;/math&gt;.  We get rid of the root by raising our answer to the nth power, i.e. &lt;math&gt;r^n = x.\!\,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
[[Algebra/Arithmetic/Root Problems|'''&lt;u&gt;Problems Using Roots&lt;/u&gt;''']]
&lt;/center&gt;

==Square root==

If you take the square root of a number, the result is a number which when squared gives the first number. This can be written symbolically as:

&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x} = y \mbox{ if } y^2 = x \,&lt;/math&gt;.  In the series of real numbers, &lt;math&gt;y^2\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; regardless of the value of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. As such, we cannot define the 
&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  

Examples:
*&lt;math&gt;\sqrt 9 = 3&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;3^2 = 3\cdot3 = 9.&lt;/math&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;x=25&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x-16}=\sqrt{25-16}=\sqrt{9}=3&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;x=7&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x-16}&lt;/math&gt; is undefined because &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x-16}=\sqrt{7-16}=\sqrt{-9}&lt;/math&gt;, but there is no number &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;y^2=-9&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the answer is '''not''' &lt;math&gt;-3&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;-3\cdot-3=9&lt;/math&gt; and not &lt;math&gt;-9&lt;/math&gt;.

You may notice or discover that there is a solution to square roots of negative numbers.  This will be discussed in the future chapter of Complex Numbers, which will require learning intermediate concepts.

==Cube roots==
 
Roots do not have to be square.  One can also take the cube root of a number (&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{ } &lt;/math&gt; ). The cube root is the number which, when cubed (multiplied by itself and then multiplied by itself again), gives back the original number. For example, the cube root of 8 is 2 because &lt;math&gt;2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8&lt;/math&gt;, or:

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{8} = 2.&lt;/math&gt;

==Other roots==

There are an infinite number of possible roots all in the form of  &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{a}&lt;/math&gt; which corresponds to &lt;math&gt;a^\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, when expressed using exponents.
If &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{a} = {b}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; b^{n} = a \,&lt;/math&gt;.  

The only exception is 0.  &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[0]{a}&lt;/math&gt; is undefined, as it corresponds to &lt;math&gt;a^\frac{1}{0}&lt;/math&gt; , resulting in a division by zero.  Even if you attempt to discover the 0&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; root of 1, you will not make progress as practically any number to the power of zero equals 1, leaving only an undefined result. 

==Irrational numbers==

If you square root a whole number which is not itself the square of a rational number the answer will have an infinite number of decimal places. Such a  number is described as irrational and is defined as a number which cannot be written as a rational number: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers.

However, using a calculator you can approximate the square root of a non-square number:

&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3} \approx 1.73205080757 &lt;/math&gt;

The result of taking the square root is written with the approximately equal sign &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; because the result is an irrational value which cannot be written in decimal notation exactly. Writing the square root of 3 or any other non-square number as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; is the simplest way to represent the exact value.

===Proof===
Taking &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; as an example.

Suppose &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; is rational and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt; \frac{a}{b} &lt;/math&gt; where a and b are integers and relatively prime.

&lt;math&gt;
3 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
a^2 = 3b^2
&lt;/math&gt;

This implies that 3 is a factor of &lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt;.
Since a is an integer and 3 is prime, 3 is a factor of a.
Let a = 3k where k is an integer.

&lt;math&gt;
a^2 = 3b^2
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
(3k)^2 = 3b^2
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
9k^2 = 3b^2
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
b^2 = 3k^2
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, 3 is a factor of b, which contradicts the first statement that a and b are relatively prime.
Therefore &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be rational.
Therefore &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; is irrational.

Irrational numbers also appear when attempting to take cube roots or other roots.  However, they are not restricted to roots, and may also appear in other mathematical constants (e.g. &amp;pi;, e, &amp;phi;, etc.).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Glossary proposal =

__TOC__

This is a proposal for organizing glossaries for Wikijunior books. Please comment, make suggestions, etc.

==Purpose==
The purpose of a glossary in a Wikijunior book is to give simple, child-appropriate definitions of potentially unfamiliar words in the context in which they are used in the book. This differs from a dictionary in that only the pertinent definition is given. For example, in a book about the human body, the word &quot;organ&quot; would be included as a glossary word. The definition would be &quot;a part of the body made up of cells doing a similar job&quot; (not &quot;a musical instrument with a keyboard&quot;).

==Visual representation==
Glossary links should be designated in a way that is visually distinct from other links (as external links are, for example). Perhaps a small icon after the link would work for this.

==Use==
Optimally, all key terms that are potentially unfamiliar to children in the target age group should be included in the glossary.

Question: Should only the first use of a word be glossary-linked (as would be done in an ebook) or should every entry be linked? One problem with the former is that it assumes a linear reading. The problem with the latter option is that there may be so many links that is distracting to (children) readers.

==Technical implementation==

Depending on others' input, I am thinking of implementing this in a way similar to the way citations are done in Wikipedia. For example, to add the word &quot;organ&quot; to the glossary, the markup could be something like:

:The stomach is an &lt;gloss=&quot;organ&quot; def=&quot;a part of the body made up of cells doing a similar job&quot;&gt;''organ''&lt;/gloss&gt; that is a part of the digestive system.

Then the glossary would be dynamically generated including the entry:

:&lt;i&gt;organ&lt;/i&gt; - a part of the body made up of cells doing a similar job

Question: Would the glossary be generated at the bottom of each module, or should there be a consolidated glossary for the whole book? From a programming standpoint, the first option is probably easier? From a pedagogical standpoint (and in a print format especially), I'd prefer the latter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FOSS Network Infrastructure and Security}}

==Security Paradigms, Security Policies and Infrastructure Issues==
Network and information security is one of the most important considerations when designing and
deploying a network. Before we can get into the details of network security implementation with FOSS,
we need to look at the different security paradigms that have been in existence for some time now. The older paradigm supported the notion that perimeter security was the ultimate form of security for any network. That myth has now been debunked, and the new paradigm advocates that every device must
be made secure in itself in addition to the perimeter security imposed by firewalls and packet filters.

Security as a technical solution is also no longer a valid assumption. Security now involves not only
stopping malicious packets from entering your network, but also preventing these malicious packets
from coming from your network; deploying tools to detect intrusion attempts and generate logs;
intelligent network sniffers and use of an individualized security policy; centralized logs to keep on top of information overload (or log overload), centrally managing the configuration firewalls and routers to detect changes (configuration management and security policy management); and host security tools to ensure that the last frontier of the protection – the host itself – is protecting data and is not compromised. All of these form a web of security that will effectively protect the organization, provided you know what you want to protect and how you want to protect it. This is to be articulated as a security policy.

The security policy is now one of the most important security tools for any organization as it helps in maintaining consistency in security implementation. Without the use of a security policy, it becomes difficult for an administrator to decide what to focus on. It also helps an organization to take action against people who defy the policy. In the absence of any such policy, work is always done on an ad hoc manner, which can create more possibilities for security breaches.

There is no one solution that can solve your security problems. What is more useful are best practices that document ways in which common security problems can be avoided. There are also security best practices for when a security breach occurs. Let’s look at common reasons for security breaches and some of the best practice remedies.

== Network Security Risks ==

=== Open Architecture of TCP/IP ===
While TCP/IP is a highly efficient, cost-effective and flexible communications protocol for local and global communications, and is widely adopted on the global Internet and in the internal networks of large corporations, it was designed 20 years ago when the Internet consisted of a few hundred closely controlled hosts with limited security. The Internet now connects millions of computers that are controlled by millions of individuals and organizations, and where the core network is administered by thousands of competing operators. This complex network spans the whole globe, connected by fibres, leased lines, dial-up modems, and mobile phones. Thus, while it is tolerant of random errors, TCP/IP is vulnerable to a number of malicious attacks.

The basic premise of ‘end-to-end’ connectivity on the Internet means that you are as likely to receive illegitimate traffic as legitimate traffic. Thus the scope of security is not to stop all traffic, but to detect and deter the most malicious of attacks.

===Common Types of Threats and Attacks===
*Unauthorized access – insecure hosts, cracking, intrusion
*Eavesdropping on a transmission – gaining access to the medium to look for passwords, credit card numbers, or business secrets
*Hijacking, or taking over a communication
*Inspecting and modifying any data being transmitted
*IP spoofing, or falsifying network addresses
*Impersonating to fool access control mechanisms
*Redirecting connections to a fake server
*Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, when a huge amount of useless data coming to the target makes it unable to function properly
*Interruption of service due to system destruction or using up all available system resources for the service CPU, memory, bandwidth
*Default passwords and default configuration

==Mistakes People Make that Lead to Security Breaches==
Technological holes account for a great number of successful break-ins, but people do their share as
well.&lt;ref&gt;Most of the points under these topics trace their origin back to the SANS institute. SANS Institute is located at http://www.sans.org. Text has been modified to suit changing times.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Five Worst Security Mistakes End-users Make===
*Failing to install an anti-virus, keep its signatures up-to-date, and perform full system scans regularly.
*Opening unsolicited e-mail attachments without verifying their sources and checking their content first, or anything from untrusted sources.
*Failing to install security patches, especially for frequently used software like those for word processing, web browser, e-mail client and operating systems.
*Not making and testing backups.
*Using a modem while connected through a local area network.

===Seven Worst Security Mistakes Senior Executives Make===
*Assigning untrained people to maintain security and providing neither the training nor the time to make it possible to learn and do the job.
*Failing to understand the relationship between information security and business problems. They understand physical security but do not see the consequences of poor information security.
*Failing to deal with the operational aspects of security: making a few fixes and then not allowing the follow-through necessary to ensure that the problems stay fixed.
*Relying primarily on a firewall.
*Failing to realize how much money their information and organizational reputations are worth.
*Authorizing reactive, short-term fixes so that problems re-emerge rapidly.
*Pretending the problem will go away if they ignore it.

===Ten Worst Security Mistakes IT People Make===
*Connecting systems to the Internet before hardening them.
*Connecting test systems to the Internet with default accounts/passwords.
*Failing to update systems when security holes are found.
*Using telnet and other unencrypted protocols for managing systems, routers, firewalls and PKI.
*Giving users passwords over the phone or changing user passwords in response to telephone or personal requests when the requester is not authenticated.
*Failing to maintain and test backups.
*Running unnecessary services: ftpd, telnetd, finger, rpc, mail, rservices.
*Implementing firewalls with rules that do not stop malicious or dangerous traffic, whether incoming or outgoing.
*Failing to implement or update virus detection software.
*Failing to educate users on what to look for and what to do when they see a potential security problem.

==Security Best Practices and To-dos==
Some set a goal to fully and completely secure a system, which is impractical as it is usually impossible to make a system full-proof. A realistic goal is to set up a regular routine where you identify/correct as many vulnerabilities as possible.

===Security Best Practices===
A good security system makes it so difficult for an attacker to gain access that he gives up or gives an administrator enough time before he gets in.
*The idea is not that you should protect a system to the point that it cannot be compromised, but
to secure it at least enough so that most intruders will not be able to break in, and will choose to
direct their efforts elsewhere. This is just like putting iron bars and locks on our windows and
doors. We do it not to ‘keep the robbers out’, but to persuade them to turn their attention to our
neighbours.
*Rather than directing our efforts at protecting against the thousands of specific threats (this
exploit, that Trojan virus, these mis-configurations), we focus our energies on tasks that provide
the most comprehensive protection against the majority of threats.
*Best security practices are very dynamic, constantly changing and evolving.
*Administrators should include their own best security practices and modify those mentioned
here to best fit their environment.

===Points to Ponder===
*Take into consideration your needs, risks, and resources.
*Information systems are unavoidably complex and fluid, so the most effective way to apply security is in layers.
*You should place security measures at different points in your network, allowing each to do what it does best.
*From an attacker’s perspective, you will have constructed a series of obstacles of varying difficulty between the attacker and your systems.
*Secure each component in your system (firewalls, routers, servers, hosts and appliances) so that even if an attacker works his/her way through your obstacle course, at the end he/she will find systems that are resistant to attack.

===Backup===
*Maintain full and reliable backups of all data and log files.
*Archive all software (purchased or freeware), upgrades, and patches off-line so that they can be reloaded when necessary.
*Backup configurations, such as the Windows registry and text/binary configuration files, used by the operating systems or applications.
*Consider the media, retention requirements, storage, rotation, methods (incremental, differential, full) and scheduling.
*Keep a copy of a full backup in a secure off-site location for disaster recovery.

===Security To-dos===
*Enforce Deny by Default. Everything that is not allowed specifically is denied. This is a good way of tightening security.
*Reduce access to things on a ‘need to know’ basis. That means that anybody who does not need access to a computer, a network, or a piece of information should not have access to it. This is also known as the Least Privilege Rule. Give the least privilege, the least access capabilities you can for someone to do his/her job.
*Try to have identified choke points, which are points where you can inspect everything going on the network – i.e., a network where all communications pass through the Internet, a VPN concentrator where all the external accesses converge, a Modem pool where all external dial-in access come to, a dedicated VLAN where all the Wireless (WLAN) Access Points are connected to see who is coming from the wireless entry points.
*Try to identify and focus on your weakest link, or the weakest part of your security that would compromise all the rest. Remember that the hacker just needs to succeed once to hack you, whereas you have to succeed all the time in your security job to protect your organization. So, the weakest link is always where you should focus your attention, trying to have no security ‘fence’ notably ‘lower’ than all the others in your network.
*You should also try to have the capability to ‘fall back’ into a secure position in case of trouble. Security Policy Management systems can ensure the ‘lock down’ of the network in case of a worm, for example. Such a configuration would allow the DNS and maybe some vital traffic for the company (payroll, electronic fund transfer, ERP traffic) and block all the potential worm infection vectors (mail, web).
*You should try to have a security device ‘deep down’ in your network, not only at the boundaries with the external world. If the life of your company depends on one computer holding sensitive data or running a factory, add a firewall in front of it. This is ‘Defense in Depth’.
*If you diversify your defense, such as running two different brands of antivirus (one kind for your mail gateway, and another kind for the desktops and user machines), that may help you catch some attacks that were not blocked by one brand but will be by the other brand. You can also have a diversity of kinds of defense, like having antivirus and personal firewalls on the desktops.
*KISS – Keep It Short and Simple. If your network and your security are simple, you will be less likely to have forgotten something that attackers will exploit. Clarity is important as you HAVE TO understand the whole network and the whole security organization. Do not feel that it is ‘dumb’ to ask ‘simple questions’; these are often the ones that will make everybody realize that there is a problem.
*Security through obscurity is the opposite of the following principle. If someone tells you ‘do not worry, this is secure’ and does not want to explain the security mechanism, then YOU SHOULD WORRY. Hiding how things work and having your security depending on this to be secure is the worst thing you can have. For example, you should still secure computers in your network even if attackers cannot download the DNS zone of your company which lists the IP addresses. Sooner or later, an attacker will find a way to know about this ‘hidden’ computer and will then have full access. The only things you should keep secret and hidden are your password and your cryptographic keys (PGP private keys). Assume that all other knowledge may be known by attackers.&lt;ref&gt;Contributed by Philippe Langlois &lt;philippelanglois@free.fr&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Securing Your Network and Hosts Properly==
===Firewalls===
Many people think that a firewall is a single device that is configured to protect your internal network from the external world. In reality, a firewall is a system (or a group of systems) that enforces an access control policy between two networks. It disallows unauthorized and/or malicious traffic from traveling into and out of your network. Users must realize that firewalls cannot protect you from attacks that do not go through it. If there is another entry point to your network that is not protected by a firewall, then your network is not secure. Also, contrary to the common misconception, firewalls do not verify the content of the traffic going through it.

===Types of Firewalls===
'''Packet filtering firewalls'''
*Examines the source and destination address of the data packet and either allows or denies the packet from traveling through the network.
*Blocks access through the firewall to any packets that try to access ports which have been declared ‘off-limits’.


'''Application layer firewalls'''
*Attempts to hide the configuration of the network behind the firewall by acting on behalf of the network/servers.
*All requests for access are translated at the firewall so that all packets are sent to and from the firewall, rather than from the hosts behind the firewall.


'''Stateful inspection firewalls'''
*Examines the state and the context of the packets.
*Remembers what outgoing requests have been sent and allows only the responses to those requests back through the firewall.
*Attempts to access the internal network that have not been requested by the internal network will be denied.

===Firewall Best Practices===
Regardless of which type of firewall, someone has to configure it to make it work properly. The rules for access must be defined and entered into the firewall for enforcement. A security manager is usually responsible for the firewall configuration. But again, if the policy is not made properly, then there is not much that the security manager can do. Some rules of thumb are:
*Explicitly deny all traffic except for what you want.
The default policy should be that if the firewall does not know what to do with the packet, it should deny/drop the data packet.
*Do not rely only on your firewall for the protection of your network. Remember that it is only a device, and devices do fail.
*Make sure you implement what is called ‘defense in depth’, or multiple layers of network protection.
*Make sure all of the network traffic passes through the firewall.
*If the firewall becomes disabled, then disable all communication.
*If there is another way into the network (like a modem pool or a maintenance network connection), then this connection could be used to enter the network, completely bypassing firewall protection.
*Disable or uninstall any unnecessary services and software on the firewall.
Limit the number of applications that run on the firewall.
*Consider running antivirus, content filtering, Virtual Private Network, etc. on different hardware.
*Do not rely on packet filtering alone. Use stateful inspection and application proxies if possible.
*Ensure that you are filtering packets for illegal/incorrect addresses, to avoid IP spoofing.
*Ensure that physical access to the firewall is controlled.
*Use firewalls internally to segment networks between different departments and permit access control based on business needs.
*Remember that firewalls will not prevent attacks that originate from inside your network.

==Netfilter/iptables==
iptables13 is the most popular FOSS firewall tool available on GNU/Linux. It works in combination with netfilter, which is included as an integral part of the Linux kernel. It has been in the kernel as the firewalling subsystem since release 2.4.x.

iptables is a much improved version of previously available IP Chains and ipfwadm software.

It does packet filtering (stateless or stateful) as well as Network Address Translation (NAT) and IP
Masquerading. It can also perform packet mangling (manipulation).

iptables consists of the following:
*Userspace command for runtime configuration of the firewalling subsystem;
*Kernel modules and the user interface application. Kernel modules are components that handle
*various tasks and are compiled as loadable modules in the GNU/Linux kernel;
*Generic table structure for the definition of rulesets; and
*A number of classifiers (matches) and one connected action (target).


'''iptables – Tables , Chains and Rules'''
iptables normally has multiple tables defined in the kernel. The default is the ‘filter’ table. The Linux kernel starts with three lists of rules in the ‘filter’ table. A chain is a checklist of rules. There are three built-in chains: the INPUT, OUTPUT and FORWARD chains. The Linux kernel examines each chain to decide the fate of the packet. In turn, each rule says ‘if the packet header looks like this, then here is what to do with the packet’.

===iptables Syntax===

:&lt;tt&gt;[root@mail /]# iptables [options] [table] rules TARGET&lt;/tt&gt;


'''Main iptables options'''

1. Create a new chain (-N).

2. Delete an empty chain (-X).

3. Change the policy for a built-in chain. (-P).

4. List the rules in a chain (-L).

5. Flush the rules out of a chain (-F).

6. Zero the packet and byte counters on all rules in a chain (-Z).

You can use ‘iptables –h’ to see a list of command options


'''To manipulate rules in a chain'''

1. Append a new rule to a chain (-A).

2. Insert a new rule at some position in a chain (-I).

3. Replace a rule at some position in a chain (-R).

4. Delete a rule at some position in a chain (-D).

5. Delete the first rule that matches in a chain (-D).


'''The default policies'''

The default policy is to accept all packets to, from, and through it.

INPUT ACCEPT any any
FORWARD ACCEPT any any
OUTPUT ACCEPT any any

To set the default policies to DROP all packets:

:&lt;tt&gt;# iptables –P INPUT DROP&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# iptables –P FORWARD DROP&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# iptables –P OUTPUT DROP&lt;/tt&gt;


'''Targets – what to do if a packet matches a rule'''

ACCEPT
DROP
REJECT
LOG


'''Example rules'''

:&lt;tt&gt;# iptables -A INPUT -s 127.0.0.1 -p icmp -j DROP&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# iptables -D INPUT 1&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# iptables -D INPUT -s 127.0.0.1 -p icmp -j DROP&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# iptables -A INPUT -s 0/0 -j DROP&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# iptables –A INPUT –p tcp –dport 25 –j ACCEPT&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# iptables –A FORWARD –p tcp dport 25 –j ACCEPT&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# iptables –A FORWARD –I eth0 –o eth1 –p tcp –dport 25 –j ACCEPT&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# iptables –A FORWARD –s 192.0.2.0/24 –d 202.52.255.1 –p tcp –
:dport 25 –j ACCEPT&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# iptables –A FORWARD –s 192.0.2.0/24 –d 202.52.255.5 –p udp –
:dport 53 –j ACCEPT&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# iptables –A FORWARD –d 202.52.255.5 –p tcp –j LOG –log-prefix “TCP log ”&lt;/tt&gt;

To get help:
:&lt;tt&gt;# iptables -p tcp -h&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# iptables -m state -h&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# iptables –j ACCEPT -h&lt;/tt&gt;


'''Connection tracking'''

Stateful connection tracking of traversing packets with –m state –state options

NEW – packets that create a NEW connection
ESTABLISHED – packets belonging to an existing connection – reply packets
RELATED – packets related to an existing connection – ICMP error messages/ FTP data connections
INVALID – packets not corresponding to any existing connection

:&lt;tt&gt;# iptables –A FORWARD –d 192.0.2.0/24 –p tcp –m –state –state ESTABLISHED –j REJECT&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# iptables –A FORWARD –m –state –state INVALID –j DROP&lt;/tt&gt;

Sample iptables setup
:&lt;tt&gt;iptables –F flush all the chains
:iptables –X delete all the empty chains&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# Changing Default policy
:iptables –P INPUT DROP
:iptables –P FORWARD DROP
:iptables –P OUTPUT DROP&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# INPUT chain
:iptables –A INPUT –p icmp –j ACCEPT
:iptables –A INPUT –I eth1 –p tcp –dport 22 –j ACCEPT
:iptables –A INPUT –I eth1 –m state –state ESTABLISHED,RELATED –j ACCEPT&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# FORWARD chain
:iptables –A FORWARD –p icmp –j ACCEPT
:iptables –A FORWARD –I eth0 –o eth1 –d 192.0.2.1 –p tcp –dport 25 –j ACCEPT
:iptables –A FORWARD –I eth0 –o eth1 –d 192.0.2.2 –p tcp –dport 110 –j ACCEPT
:iptables –A FORWARD –I eth0 –o eth1 –d 192.0.2.3 –p tcp –dport 80 –j ACCEPT
:iptables –A FORWARD –I eth0 –o eth1 –d 192.0.2.4 –p tcp –dport 53 –j ACCEPT
:iptables –A FORWARD –I eth0 –o eth1 –d 192.0.2.4 –p udp –dport 53 –j ACCEPT
:iptables –A FORWARD –I eth0 –o eth1 –d 192.0.2.0/24 –m state – state ESTABLISHED,RELATED –j ACCEPT
:iptables –A FORWARD –I eth1 –o eth0 –s 192.0.2.1 –p tcp –dport 25 –j ACCEPT
:iptables –A FORWARD –I eth1 –o eth0 –s 192.0.2.4 –p tcp –dport 53 –j ACCEPT

:iptables –A FORWARD –I eth1 –o eth0 –s 192.0.2.0/24 –m state – state ESTABLISHED,RELATED –j ACCEPT&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# OUTPUT chain
:iptables –A OUTPUT –p icmp –j ACCEPT
:iptables –A OUTPUT –o eth1 –p tcp –dport 22 –j ACCEPT
:iptables –A INPUT –o eth1 –m state –state ESTABLISHED,RELATED –j ACCEPT&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;# Enabling NAT
:iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.0.2.0/24 -j MASQUERADE&lt;/tt&gt;

==Server Security, Host/Network Scanning and Intrusion Detection System==
It is often advisable that a detection and prevention measure be run in addition to the firewall. This is commonly referred to as Network Scanning and Intrusion Detection System (IDS). There are also other proactive measures that can make your system and servers secure. Let’s look at some of these.

===Server Security Dos and Don’ts===
*Run the server on a hardened and routinely updated operating system.
*Keep current on software/application updates.
*Ensure that you test these updates in a controlled, non-production environment whenever possible.
*One server patch may undo a correction applied by a previous patch so scan the server after the patching-up.
*Disable file sharing on all critical machines as it makes them vulnerable to information theft and certain types of quick-moving viruses.
*Improper sharing configurations can expose critical system files or give full file system access to any hostile party.

===Host/Network Scanning===
Network scanning refers to the activity of scanning your own networks for vulnerabilities. There are tools available for this purpose. Incidentally, these are most often the same tools used by crackers and external parties to gauge your network security. Thus, using them yourself can lead you to quite a few of those security holes, which would go unnoticed otherwise. Below are some tips on what to scan for.


'''Scanning systems tips'''

*Scans will help determine that only the required ports are open.
*Check that services running on the open ports are not vulnerable to known security bugs/holes.
*If new open ports are found, check if your systems have been compromised.
*Perform full port scans using a tool like nmap/ndiff, nessus, or fscan on a regular basis.
*Port scans should cover all ports (1-65,535), both UDP and TCP, on all systems: both client and server devices such as routers, switches, printers, and anything else connected (physically through wire or wireless) to your network.

===Nmap===
Nmap&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insecure.org/nmap&lt;/ref&gt; is a Network MAPper. It is a powerful utility for network exploration or security auditing, which can rapidly scan large networks or single hosts to determine the hosts available on the network, the services they (ports) are offering, the operating system (and OS version) they are running, and the type of packet filters/firewalls in use. It runs on most types of computers, and both console and graphical versions are available. It is also a GNU GPL software, available with full source code.

Here are examples of Nmap usage:

1. This option scans all reserved TCP ports on the machine. The -v means turn on verbose mode.

:&lt;tt&gt;nmap -v target.example.com&lt;/tt&gt;

2. This launches a stealth SYN&lt;ref&gt;According to Wikipedia, SYN scan is the most popular form of TCP scanning. Rather than use the operating system’s network functions, the port scanner generates raw IP packets itself, and monitors for responses. This scan type is also known as ‘half-open scanning’, because it never actually opens a full TCP connection.&lt;/ref&gt; scan against each machine that is up out of the 255 machines on class ´C´ where target.example.com resides. It also tries to determine what operating system is running on each host that is up and running. This requires root privileges because of the SYN scan and the OS detection.

:&lt;tt&gt;nmap -sS -O target.example.com/24&lt;/tt&gt;

3. This sends a Xmas tree scan to the first half of each of the 255 possible 8-bit subnets in the 198.116 class ´B´ address space. We are testing whether the systems run sshd, DNS, pop3d, mapd, or port 4564. Note that Xmas scan does not work on Microsoft boxes due to their reduced TCP stack. The
same goes with CISCO, IRIX, HP/UX, and BSD boxes.

:&lt;tt&gt;nmap -sX -p 22,53,110,143,4564 198.116.*.1-127&lt;/tt&gt;

4. Rather than focus on a specific IP range, it is sometimes interesting to slice up the entire Internet and scan a small sample from each slice. This command finds all web servers on machines with IP addresses ending in .2.3, .2.4, or .2.5.

:&lt;tt&gt;nmap -v —randomize_hosts -p 80 ´*.*.2.3-5´&lt;/tt&gt;

5.Launch a stealth scan with OS detection on all privileged ports against 255 hosts in the network, and then output the results into the file /root/nmap.scan.

:&lt;tt&gt;nmap –sS –O 192.0.2.0/24 –oN /root/nmap.scan&lt;/tt&gt;

6. Launch a stealth scan with OS detection on specified ports against 255 hosts in the network, in verbose mode.

:&lt;tt&gt;nmap –sS –O –v 192.0.2.0/24 –p ‘1-1024,1080,3128’&lt;/tt&gt;

==Nessus==
The mantra for network monitoring and scanning could be: ‘Prevention is ideal, but detection is a must’. We must realize that the no prevention technique is fool-proof and new vulnerabilities are discovered every week that you may not be aware of. Thus, constant vigilance is required to detect new unknown attacks. Once you are attacked, without logs, you have little chance of finding what the attackers did. It is also common sense that you cannot detect an attack if you do not know what is occurring on your network. Logs provide the details of what is occurring, what systems are being attacked, and what systems have been compromised. If any log entry does not look right, you should investigate them immediately. But thousands of lines of logs are produced every day. It is necessary to use the appropriate tools to diagnose these. It is also necessary for these logs and scans to be compared against vulnerability databases, so that the security gap in the network can be known immediately.

===Nessus===
Nessus&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nessus.org&lt;/ref&gt; is a security scanner that can remotely audit a given network or server. It can determine whether ‘crackers’ may break into it, or misuse your network or servers in some way.

Unlike others, Nessus does not take anything for granted and will not assume that services run only on fixed ports. For example, if you run your web server on port 1234, Nessus will detect it and test its security. It will not make its security tests by the version number, but will really attempt to exploit the vulnerability. It is very fast and reliable, and has a modular architecture that allows you to fit it to your needs. Nessus also has front ends for both Windows and Macintosh.

===Nessus Installation===
Nessus is made up of two parts: a client and a server. You need a UNIX -like system to use the server. In this test, the standard client Nessus is used, mainly because it supports the cipher layer. The Nessus Security Scanner relies on the following items:
*GTK - The Gimp Tool Kit, version 1.2
::GTK is a set of Widgets (like Motif) which is used by many FOSS applications such as The Gimp.
::GTK is used by the POSIX client Nessus.

::Download it at ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gtk/v1.2

::Note #1: If your system comes with GTK, make sure that you have the gtk-config program installed.
::If you do not, install the gtk-devel package that should come on your distribution CD-ROM.

::Note #2: If you do not want to install GTK and/or if your system lacks X11, then you can compile a command-line client by doing .
::&lt;tt&gt;/configure –disable-gtk&lt;/tt&gt;
::in nessus-core

*Nmap, which we already covered earlier, is an excellent port scanner. It is available at http://www.insecure.org/nmap/.
*OpenSSL (optional but heavily recommended) is used for the client-server communication as well as in the testing of SSL-enabled services. Get it at http://www.openssl.org.

Nessus also comes as a standalone package that auto-installs itself. To use it, download the script nessusinstaller. sh at http://www.nessus.org/download.html.

===Using Nessus===
'''Create a nessusd account''' 

The nessusd server has its own user database, with each user having a set of restrictions. This allows you to share a single nessusd server for a whole network and different administrators who will only test their part of the network.

The utility nessus-adduser takes care of the creation of a new account:

:&lt;tt&gt;# nessus-adduser&lt;/tt&gt;

Using /var/tmp as a temporary file holder

Add a new nessusd user

:Login: sunil
:Authentication (pass/cert) [pass]:
:Login password: nessus
:User rules

nessusd has a rules system which allows you to restrict the hosts that Sunil has the right to test. For instance, you may want him to be able to scan his own host only.

Please see the nessus-adduser man page for the rules syntax. Enter the rules for this user, and hit ctrl-D once you are done: (the user can have an empty rules set)

:Login: sunil
:Password: nessus
:DN:
:Rules:

:Is that ok? (y/n) [y]
:User added.


'''Configure your Nessus daemon'''

In the file /usr/local/etc/nessus/nessusd.conf, you can set several options for nessusd. Typically, this is where you can define that you want nessusd to use your favourite language. The standard configuration file has been kept for this illustration.


'''Start nessusd'''

Once all of this is done, you can safely start nessusd as root:

:&lt;tt&gt;nessusd -D&lt;/tt&gt;


'''Fire up Nessus in X windows graphical environment'''

Click on Login, since this setup is correct. Since this is the first time you are connecting to this server, it will ask for the password. The next time you connect to it, the public key will be enough.
Once connected, the Log-in button changes to Log-out, and a Connected label appears at its left.


'''The security checks configuration''' 

Let all the security checks be performed, except the DoS attacks, because you do not want hosts to
crash.

Clicking on a plugin name will pop up a window explaining what the plugin does.


'''The plugins preferences'''

Some security checks will require extra arguments. For instance, the pop2 overflow security test needs a valid pop account. The plugin, which tests whether an FTP directory is writeable or not, asks if it should just trust the permissions or really attempt to store a file.


'''The scan options'''

Here you choose which port scanner you want to use. Opt for the Nmap tcp connect scanner, since it is
the fastest.


'''Define the targets'''

Uncheck the ‘Perform a DNS transfer zone’ option, since it would make DNS transfer on fr.nessus.org and nessus.org, and it would be useless, since it would not gain any new hosts.

Use the following options to define the targets:
:&lt;tt&gt;192.0.2.1 A single IP address.
:192.0.2.1-7 A range of IP addresses.
:192.0.2.1-192.0.3.50 Another range of IP addresses.
:192.0.2.1/29 Again a range of IP addresses in CIDR&lt;ref&gt;Classless Inter Domain Routing.&lt;/ref&gt;
:prof.fr.nessus.org A hostname in FQDN&lt;ref&gt;Fully Qualified Domain Name.&lt;/ref&gt; notation.
:prof A hostname (as long as it is resolvable on the server).

:prof, 192.0.2.1/29, ... Any combination of the above mentioned forms separated by a comma.&lt;/tt&gt;


'''The rules section'''

The rules allow a user to restrict his test. For instance, if you want to test 192.0.2.0/29, except 192.0.2.2. The rule set entered allows you to do that. Once all of this is done, start the scan.


'''The Nessus scan report'''

Now that the scan is over, the report window just pops up.


'''Resolving the security issues'''

Go through the scan report and try to resolve reported security holes on the respective servers by following the suggestions given in the report OR by referring to the vendor’s site.

==Intrusion Detection System (IDS)==
Intrusion detection is the art of detecting inappropriate, incorrect, or anomalous activity. IDS inspects/ sniffs all network traffic passing through it for any abnormal content. It has a built-in signature-base and anomaly detection, which provides the capability to look for set ‘patterns’ in packets. It can also string search signature (i.e., look for confidential information), log and TCP reset features. IDS provides worthwhile information about malicious network traffic and helps identify the source of incoming probes, scans, or attacks. It is similar to a security camera or a burglar alarm as it alerts security personnel that someone is picking the ‘lock’ – i.e., it alerts security personnel that a network invasion may be in progress.

==SNORT==
The most common FOSS IDS in use is SNORT.19 It does the following:
*Monitors network traffic for predefined suspicious activities or patterns
*Alerts system administrators when potential hostile traffic is detected
*Serves as a cross-platform, lightweight network intrusion detection tool
*Can be deployed to monitor small TCP/IP networks
*Detects a wide variety of suspicious network traffic as well as outright attacks
*Deployed rapidly to fill potential holes in a network’s security coverage

==Three Modes of SNORT==
'''Sniffer mode'''

Displays the packet headers or data
:&lt;tt&gt;snort –v
:snort –vd&lt;/tt&gt;


'''Packet logger mode'''

Records packets to the disk

:&lt;tt&gt;snort –dev –l ./log
:&lt;tt&gt;snort -l ./log –b&lt;/tt&gt; log all packets in binary mode
:&lt;tt&gt;snort –dvr ./log/snort.&lt;/tt&gt;log to display packets in ascii mode from the binary log


'''Network intrusion detection mode'''

Does not record every single packet sent down the wire

:&lt;tt&gt;snort -d -h 192.0.2.0/24 -l ./log -c snort.conf&lt;/tt&gt;

This will configure SNORT to run in its most basic NIDS mode, logging packets that the rules tell it to in plain ASCII to a hierarchical directory structure (just like the packet logger mode).

To send NIDS alerts to syslog use -s:

:&lt;tt&gt;snort -s -h 192.0.2.0/24 –l ./log -c snort.conf&lt;/tt&gt;


{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px;&quot;
|[[Image:Eprimer_Network.jpg|600px]]
|}

===High Performance Configuration===
:&lt;tt&gt;snort -b -A fast -c snort.conf&lt;/tt&gt;

This logs packets in tcpdump format and produces minimal alerts.

To read this file back and break out the data in the familiar SNORT format:

:&lt;tt&gt;snort -d -c snort.conf -l ./log -h 192.0.2.0/24 -r snort.log&lt;/tt&gt;

To run SNORT in daemon mode (provide full paths):

:&lt;tt&gt;usr/local/bin/snort -d -h 192.0.2.0/24 -l /var/log/snortlogs -c /
:usr/local/etc/snort.conf -s -D&lt;/tt&gt;

To post packet logs to public mailing lists use –O to obfuscate your IP addresses

:&lt;tt&gt;snort -d -v -r snort.log -O -h 192.0.2.0/24&lt;/tt&gt;

To get help options:

:&lt;tt&gt;snort –h&lt;/tt&gt;

==OpenSSH==
One of the biggest advantages of UNIX and GNU/Linux is the ability to work remotely on the server
systems. This feature is an inherent part of any UNIX-like operating system. In earlier days, most people used Telnet to log remotely into servers but now Telnet has been made obsolete by ssh or secure shell.

The main difference between Telnet and ssh is the secure communication protocol of the latter. In Telnet all of the communication was done in plain text, whereas in ssh all communication is encrypted.

OpenSSH&lt;ref&gt;http://www.openssh.org&lt;/ref&gt; is both an ssh server and client. It is installed by default on most GNU/Linux distributions. Since it even encrypts the password sent to set up the session, it effectively eliminates eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other network-level attacks. It includes the following different server subsystems:

:&lt;tt&gt;sshd – ssh daemon run on the server machine
:sftp-server – sftp server sub-system
:ssh-agent – authentication agent that holds the keys
:ssh-add – used to register new keys with the Agent
:ssh-keygen – used to create public authentication keys&lt;/tt&gt;

===OpenSSH Config Files===
Since OpenSSH is both a client and a server, there are two configuration files for each purpose:

/etc/ssh/ssh_config – ssh client systemwide configuration file, provides defaults for users

/etc/ssh/sshd_config - sshd server system-wide configuration file

===OpenSSH Server Configuration===
'''Installation and basic operation'''

Install the openssh-server and openssh rpm package included in your Linux distribution. Most GNU/
Linux distributions will have the option to install OpenSSH. Please note that the openssh-server package depends on the openssh package. OpenSSH packages also require the OpenSSL package (openssl) which installs several important cryptographic libraries that help OpenSSH provide encrypted communications. 

OpenSSH daemon, sshd, uses the configuration file ‘/etc/ssh/sshd_config’

The default config file is sufficient. For customization, refer to the sshd main page for config options.


'''Editing/viewing the sshd_config file'''

[root@mail /] # vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

:&lt;tt&gt;#Port 22 - Specifies the port number that sshd listens on&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;#Protocol 2,1 - Specifies the protocol versions sshd supports&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0 - Specifies the local addresses sshd should listen on&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;#HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key - Specifies a file containing a private host key used by SSH&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;#SyslogFacility AUTH - Gives the facility code that is used when sshd logs messages&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;#LogLevel INFO - Gives the verbosity level that is used when sshd logs messages&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;#LoginGraceTime 600 – time limit for a user to log in&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;#PermitRootLogin yes - Specifies whether the root can login using ssh&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;#StrictModes yes - Specifies whether sshd should check file modes and ownership of the user’s files and home directory before accepting login&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;#PubkeyAuthentication yes - Specifies whether public key 
:authentication is allowed&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;#PasswordAuthentication yes - Specifies whether password 
:authentication is allowed&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;#PermitEmptyPasswords no - When password authentication is allowed, it specifies whether the server allows login to accounts with empty password strings&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;#MaxStartups 10 - Specifies the maximum number of concurrent unauthenticated connections to the sshd daemon&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;#KeepAlive yes - Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the other side&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;#VerifyReverseMapping no - Specifies whether sshd should try to verify the remote host name&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;Subsystem sftp /usr/libexec/opensshsftp-server&lt;/tt&gt;


'''Managing the sshd service'''

To start the service: &lt;tt&gt;#/etc/rc.d/init.d/ sshd start&lt;/tt&gt;

To stop the service: &lt;tt&gt;#/etc/rc.d/init.d/ sshd stop&lt;/tt&gt;

To restart the service: &lt;tt&gt;#/etc/rc.d/init.d/ sshd restart&lt;/tt&gt;

To automatically run the service: &lt;tt&gt;# chkconfig sshd on&lt;/tt&gt;

===OpenSSH Client Configuration===
To connect to an OpenSSH server from a client machine, you must have the openssh-clients and openssh
packages installed on the client machine.

System-wide ssh client configuration is stored in '''/etc/ssh_config''' and is used as the default for all systemwide users.

The configuration values can be changed in per user configuration files or on the command line. The
default home directory is '''~/.ssh'''


'''Using the ssh with password authentication'''

1. Make sure you have the following enabled in /etc/sshd_config file on the ssh server

:&lt;tt&gt;PasswordAuthentication yes&lt;/tt&gt;

2. To log in to a host named server.com, type the following:

:&lt;tt&gt;$ ssh gaurab@server.com&lt;/tt&gt;

The first time you ssh to a remote machine, you will see a message similar to the following:

:&lt;tt&gt;The authenticity of host ‘server.com (192.0.2.22)’ can’t be established.
:RSA key fingerprint is
:0f:41:6c:52:31:59:43:0f:dd:49:5f:3d:47:9d:b5:9e.
:Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes&lt;/tt&gt;

Type '''yes''' to continue.&lt;br&gt;
This will add the server to your list of known hosts as seen in the following message:

:&lt;tt&gt;Warning: Permanently added ‘server.com,192.0.2.22’ (RSA) to the list of knownhosts.
:gaurab@server.com’s password:
:Last login: Sat Oct 16 19:34:13 2004 from gw-ktm.lahai.com
:[gaurab@server.com gaurab]$&lt;/tt&gt;

3. '''known_hosts''' file in '''.ssh''' folder contains the remote servers’ host keys:

:&lt;tt&gt;$ more known_hosts
:server.com,192.0.2.22 ssh-rsa
:AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEA5IwKqHiqSeXjrX3dCpS1gXZo9GqJ0hkk+clf+WmABYbEH6IGMyy2CeA
:RtaR6QLpqB1SaGEFsn84dqA6kWLYfn4FuDVDc8KTyABLVEMOm6NnLZkHPKr3Cb0RgivDYSYHlwgWu
:Di7XBvmoC44WA2EbM7eBy5h1kHrXZ5yPXq3rxI0=&lt;/tt&gt;


'''Using the ssh command with public key authentication'''

1. Make sure you have the following enabled in /etc/sshd_config file on the ssh server.

PubkeyAuthentication yes

2. Key pair generation:
:'''ssh-keygen''' - authentication key generation, management and conversion

To generate a RSA key pair to work with version 2 of the protocol:

:&lt;tt&gt;$ ssh-keygen -t rsa

:Generating public/private rsa key pair.
:Enter the file in which to save the key ('''/home/gaurab/.ssh/id_rsa'''):

:Enter a passphrase that is different from your account password and confirm it by entering it again:
:Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
:Enter same passphrase again:

:Your identification has been saved in /home/gaurab/.ssh/id_rsa.
:Your public key has been saved in /home/gaurab/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
:The key fingerprint is:
:e5:a1:ac:ce:8d:16:3a:b9:3a:e4:e9:06:9c:90:b6:da gaurab@lahai.com

:The public key is written to '''~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub'''.
:The private key is written to '''~/.ssh/id_rsa'''.
:Never distribute your private key to anyone and change the permissions of your .ssh directory using the command chmod '''755 ~/.ssh'''

:$ ll .ssh/
:total 8
:-rw——— 1 gaurab gaurab 951 Oct 16 19:37 id_rsa
:-rw-r—r— 1 gaurab gaurab 236 Oct 16 19:37 id_rsa.pub&lt;/tt&gt;

Copy the contents of '''~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub''' to '''~/.ssh/authorized_keys''' on the machine to which you want to connect.

If the file '''~/.ssh/authorized_keys''' does not exist, you can copy the file '''~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub''' to the file '''~/.ssh/authorized_keys''' on the remote SSH server.

Securely copy your public key file to the remote ssh server:

:&lt;tt&gt;$ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub gaurab@server.com:&lt;/tt&gt;

Logon to the remote ssh server using password authentication, one more time:

&lt;:tt&gt;$ ssh gaurab@server.com&lt;/tt&gt;

Copy the content of the public key file to authorized_keys file on the remote host:

:&lt;tt&gt;$ cat id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;tt&gt;

Now, logon to the remote ssh server via public key authentication:

:&lt;tt&gt;$ ssh gaurab@server.com

:Enter passphrase for key ‘/home/gaurab/.ssh/id_rsa’:
:Last login: Sat Oct 16 19:40:11 2004 from myhost.com
:[gaurab@server.com gaurab]$&lt;tt&gt;

To run a command on the remote host with ssh and exit:

:&lt;tt&gt;$ ssh ns.lahai.com ls /usr/share/doc&lt;/tt&gt;


'''Using the scp command'''

The scp command is used to transfer files between machines over a secure, encrypted connection.

To transfer the local file shadowman to /home/username/shadowman on penguin.example.net:

:&lt;tt&gt;$ scp shadowman username@penguin.example.net:/home/username&lt;/tt&gt;

To transfer a remote file to the local system:

:&lt;tt&gt;$ scp username@tohostname:/remotefile /newlocalfile&lt;/tt&gt;

To transfer the contents of the directory /downloads to an existing directory called “uploads” on the
remote machine penguin.example.net:

:&lt;tt&gt;$ scp /downloads/* username@penguin.example.net:/uploads/&lt;tt&gt;


'''Using the sftp command'''

The sftp command is used to open a secure, interactive FTP session via an encrypted channel.

:&lt;tt&gt;$ sftp username@hostname.com&lt;/tt&gt;

Once authenticated, you can use a set of commands similar to using FTP.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FOSS Network Infrastructure and Security}}

A network in any computing environment is always a long-term investment. It is imperative that proper
planning be done before going all out to deploy a network. A few pointers on network design and
development are given below.

==Network Planning Basics==
'''Capacity:''' Plan for at least two to three years

'''Infrastructure:''' Build for at least one year

'''Business Models:''' Look after the next quarter

As illustrated above, there are three factors to consider when planning a network. The first is capacity, both in terms of bandwidth as well as human resource. Second, you need to consider the infrastructure that you need to build to support the capacity. Ultimately, your network is good only for as long as it can help you meet business needs and costs. For both service providers and non-profit organizations, planning should be for at least two to three years. However, at the same time, the infrastructure should be able to handle at least another year of operation.

==Major Considerations==
Here are some more points to consider:

*Identify the components of a LAN/WAN and determine the type of network design that is most appropriate for a given site.
*Identify the different media used in network communications, distinguish between them, and determine how to use them to connect servers and workstations in a network.
*Differentiate between the different networking standards, protocols, and access methods, and determine which would be most appropriate for a given situation.
*Recognize the primary network architectures, identify their major characteristics, and determine which would be most appropriate for a proposed system.
*Identify the primary functions of network operating systems and distinguish between a centralized computing environment and a client/server environment.
*Determine how to implement and support the major networking components (including the server, operating system and clients), and propose a system for adequately securing data on a given LAN and protecting the system’s components.
*Distinguish between LANs and WANs, identify the components used to expand a LAN into a WAN, and determine how to implement an appropriate modem in the larger LAN/WAN environment.
*Identify strategic LAN support tools and resources, and determine how to use these in troubleshooting basic network problems.

==Services Planning==
'''Mail'''

Choose a reliable MTA, but at the same time be cautious about spam, as it is a big headache.

Make redundant servers.

Separate user servers from real servers.


'''DNS'''

Use the latest BIND releases.

Plan nomenclature properly, but do not make it too obvious.

Redundancy is most important.

Arrange to host alternative DNS servers at off site/multiple locations.


'''User Services'''

E-mail access – POP, Web.

Web access.

Transparent caching/proxy.


'''Core Services – Infrastructure'''

Multi home: try to buy bandwidth from an IX facility.

Buying capacity is cheaper than managed capacity.

Plan to peer with other ISPs as much as possible.


'''Routers'''

Use loopback address in a separate subnet.

Use the lookback address as RouterID.

For core routers, memory is important.

For edge routers, ports are important.

Take configuration backups regularly.


'''Switching'''

Switching capacity is never enough. Invest in large switches, if that is what you will need in future.

Use VLANs to separate different groups of machines/networks.

For backbones, gigabit Ethernet is now more commonly used.


'''Backbone'''

Switched vs. routed backbone.

The same decisions apply as in LAN connections.

The backbone itself can be switched, and the traffic between different subnets can be routed.

Switching has its advantages if there is large local broadband use.


'''Branch Offices'''

Branch offices (BOs) need to be planned well in advance.

BOs tend to grow faster than you think they will.

:Basic considerations for BOs.
:Multihoming.
:Distributed user services.
:Authentication/remote management.


'''Hosts'''

Core services.

Use separate servers for separate functions.

1U servers are more manageable and also consume less power and space.

Use standardized platform as much as possible.

==Using FOSS==
In an integrated environment, FOSS tools are used alongside proprietary software and tools. This is a
common scenario, but when it comes to network infrastructure, resources and security, FOSS provides
an established and proven track record as the best software choice available in this area. In a networked environment, the ability to quickly diagnose and solve problems is critical. Experienced network administrators know that 80 percent of all network-related problems have to do with cabling and physical problems. Many problems can be minimized by using the best software in each category and, today, as argued above, the best software in most cases are FOSS.</text>

|-
! Host
| Any device connected to the Internet or a TCP/IP network is referred to as the host.
|-
! IEFT
| The Internet Engineering Task Force is the Internet standards making organization. IETF publishes the RFC series documents as Internet standards. See http://www.ietf.org.
|-
! Internet 
| The Internet is commonly referred to as the ‘networks of networks’. In technical terms, the Internet is the global network of computers that are able to communicate in TCP/IP with each other.
|-
! Intranet
| A private network, which operates on the same principles as the Internet, is called Intranet. Intranets also use the TCP/IP protocol.
|-
! Localhost
| Computers with TCP/IP installed refer to their loopback interface as the local host. This is defined by default in the DNS software.
|-
! Loopback
| Loopback is a virtual interface defined in all TCP/IP computers. This virtual interface is assigned the IP address 127.0.0.1 and is required for TCP/IP to work properly.
|-
! PoP
| Point of Presence – an Internet service provider’s branch office. This should not be confused with POP3, which is an e-mail protocol and stands for Post Office Protocol.
|-
! Port
| The points of contacts with any TCP/IP host. TCP/IP computers with IP addresses have ports ranging from 1 to 65336, which act as points of contact for different services running on that computer. For example, the SMTP protocol uses port 25, HTTP uses port 80, and so on.
|-
! RFC
| Request for Comments is the series of documentation for Internet standards documents.
|-
! Server
| A server is a powerful computer that serves resources to other computers on the network. The server can also be a big storage space as well as a database. The key here is the special software that enables the hardware to provide services.
|-
! SSL
| Secure Sockets Layer is a secure communications layer that makes it possible to use the Web for e-commerce transactions. It makes sure that all communications between a client and server is encrypted.
|-
! VLAN
| A virtual LAN is a feature provided by many Ethernet switches, to allow the creation of multiple logical networks over the same physical connections. A single switch with three VLANs behaves the same way as three different physical switches.
|-
! VPN
| Virtual Private Networks are encrypted private networks which are running on top of the public network like the Internet.

Gaurab Raj Upadhaya is currently employed as Internet Economics Analyst/Staff Engineer at Packet
Clearing House (http://www.pch.net), a research non-profit based in Berkeley, California. He works mostly in Internet backbone operations, analyzing peering relationships between operators and roles of Internet Exchange Points in different parts of Asia. Much of the work involves training ISPs in developing countries about best practices on network operations. He also runs the PCH INOC-DBA (http://www.pch.net/inocdba) hotline phone system for service providers. He initiated the Nepal Internet Exchange and currently serves as its voluntary CEO.

In 2003, Gaurab started the South Asian Network Operators Group (SANOG), a non-profit educational event and forum for ISPs in the South Asian Region (http://www.sanog.org). SANOG has a track  dedicated to in-depth hands-on workshops on ISP operations using FOSS, along side other workshops on BIND/DNS and Security. He currently chairs SANOG. He is also the vice-chair of Asia Pacific Internet Association (http://www.apia.org), and Management Committee member for Asia Pacific Regional Internet Conference on Operational Technologies (APRICOT) (http://www.apricot.net).

In the past he has served as a National UN Volunteer, working for the UNDP/Cisco/USAID Least Developing
Countries Initiative (http://www.cisco.com/edu/ldci) as Unites volunteer (http://www.unites.org). He has been using Linux and FOSS since 1996. He previously worked as system and network administrator for
United Mission to Nepal (http://www.umn.org.np).

His personal website is http://www.gaurab.org.np. He likes travel, photography and reading books when
he is not on the network.

I would like to acknowledge all those who have helped and contributed to the preparation of this
e-primer. My colleagues at PCH, Bill Woodcock and Daniel S. Silverstein, have provided both structural
and content inputs. Ritesh Raj Josti of Mercantile Communications, who is my co-instructor at APRICOT,
has provided the basis for a lot of security-related materials.

Thanks to Bill Manning (EP.net) for reviewing DNS-related materials and Merike Kaeo (Doubleshot Security) for reviewing the security-related materials. Vicky Shrestha (WorldlinkCommunications) for doing a sanity checks on all the configurations.

I’d also like to thank the IOSN Team, Kenneth Wong, Sunil Abraham, Khairil Yusof, Phet Sayo and Shahid
Akhtar, for being patient.

Lastly, thanks to all the reviewers – Philippe Langlois, Dinesh Nair, Devdas Bhagat, Nah Soo Hoe, Raj

The Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme (APDIP) is an initiative of the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) that aims to promote the development and application
of information and communication technologies for sustainable human development in the Asia-
Pacific region. APDIP aims to meet its goals by focusing on three inter-related core areas: (i) policy
development and dialogue; (ii) access; and (iii) content development and knowledge
management.

APDIP collaborates with national governments, regional, international and multi-lateral
development organizations, UN agencies, educational and research organizations, civil
society groups, and the private sector in integrating ICTs in the development process. It does so by
employing a dynamic mix of strategies – awareness raising, capacity building, technical assistance and
advice, research and development, knowledge sharing and partnership building.

The International Open Source Network (IOSN) is an initiative of APDIP and supported by the
International Development Research Centre of Canada. IOSN is a Centre of Excellence for Free/Open
Source Software (FOSS), Open Content and Open Standards in the Asia-Pacific region. It is a network
with a small secretariat based at the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok and three centres of excellence –
IOSN ASEAN+3, IOSN PIC (Pacific Island Countries), and IOSN South Asia, based in Manila, Suva and
Chennai respectively.

IOSN provides policy and technical advice on FOSS to governments, civil society and the private sector.
It produces FOSS awareness and training materials and distributes them under open content licenses.
It also organizes awareness raising, training, research and networking initiatives to assist countries in developing a pool of human resources skilled in the use and development of FOSS. IOSN works primarily through its web portal http://www.iosn.net that is collectively managed by the FOSS community. The web portal serves as a clearinghouse and a platform for knowledge sharing and collaborations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Blood vessels are tiny tubes inside your body that carry blood around your body.

__TOC__
==What do blood vessels look like?==

Blood vessels are long thin tubes that run all through the body. Some are larger than others. Most are very small. Some are so small that you can't even see them without a microscope. If you look at your wrist or leg, you can see blue lines just below the skin. These are your blood vessels. They look blue because of the way light goes through your skin and lights up the carbon dioxide rich cells in the blood stream, but the blood [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#plasma|plasma]] remains red.

There are a huge number of blood vessels in your body. If they were all stretched out, there would be over 60,000 miles of blood vessels!

[[Image:Arteries.PNG|This is a very basic illustration showing what your arteries look like]]
[[Image:Veins.PNG|This is a very basic illustration showing what your veins look like]]

==What are the parts of the blood vessels?==

Blood vessels are hollow tubes that blood flows through. They have walls made of muscle. The hollow place inside of the blood vessel is called the '''lumen'''.

Veins have small flaps of tissue called valves. These keep the blood flowing the right direction.

==What is the function of the blood vessels?==

The main function of blood vessels is to carry blood through the body. The blood carries oxygen, nutrients, and wastes that need to move around the body. There are three kinds of blood vessels: '''arteries''', '''veins''', and '''capillaries'''. 

The arteries carry blood away from the heart and transport it to the rest of the body. The blood in arteries carries oxygen and nutrients to different parts of the body.
 
The veins carry blood the opposite direction, back to the heart from the rest of the body. The blood in veins carry wastes that need to leave the body.

Arteries have a thicker wall and a smaller inside hole than veins. The reason for this is that arteries carry blood that is pumped all over the body. That pumping requires a lot of power from the heart. This pumping causes high pressure, and so the walls of the artery need to be thick and strong.

The third kind of blood vessels is capillaries. They are very tiny. You would need a microscope to see one. They connect the arteries to the veins. They let oxygen and nutrients pass from the blood to body cells. They also let carbon dioxide and other wastes pass from the cells back into the blood. This is possible because the walls of the capillaries are so thin that substances can pass through easily. This happens through a process called diffusion.

==How do the blood vessels interact with other parts of the body?==

Blood vessels start at the heart and extend out to the rest of the body. The heart is important in pumping the blood through the blood vessels. The stomach and small intestine are where the blood picks up nutrients.

Blood vessels touch almost every part of the body. They carry oxygen and nutrients to every other organ. Without blood vessels, the rest of our body couldn't survive.

==How can you keep your blood vessels healthy?==

An important part of keeping your blood vessels healthy is eating right. 

You may have heard of cholesterol. If you eat too much fatty food, like butter, cheese, chips, or crisps, some of this fat naturally builds up around the arteries and veins. This is known as '''cholesterol'''. If there is too much cholesterol, it can build up and eventually starts to clog or block your arteries. Here are two pictures showing this:

[[Image:Arteries_Ch_1.PNG|Your arteries with the normal level of cholesterol]]
[[Image:Arteries_2_Ch.PNG|The arteries clogged up with too much cholesterol]]

In the first picture, there is more blood and also less cholesterol. In the second picture, there is less blood in the arteries and more cholesterol. This is because the cholesterol clogs the arteries and reduces the amount of blood which flows in them. Because the arteries carry blood from the heart all over the body, this reduces the amount of blood supplied to your body cells.

This can have dangerous and life-threatening effects. Eventually, it may even cause a heart attack. Reducing the amount of fatty food you eat can reduce cholesterol though. It is especially important to avoid trans-fats, a very unhealthy kind of fat. Eating fruits and vegetables can also help reduce cholesterol. It is also helpful to get exercise. Playing outside, riding a bicycle, or playing your favourite sport are all good activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Д/ДЗ and Т/Ц Transformations (Diekannie and Tiekannie)==

With most consonants, their hard and soft modifications are denoted by a single letter. The exceptions are ''д'' and ''т''. When they get to a soft position, they transform to ''дз'' and ''ц'' respectively. Soft ''дз'' and ''ц'' do not stand for hard ''дз'' and ''ц''.

'''кот''' &quot;kot&quot; a cat - '''ко́цік''' &quot;kotik&quot; a cat (diminutive)

'''вада́''' &quot;vada&quot; water - '''вадзіца''' &quot;vaditsa&quot; water (diminutive)

This has some phonetical background, however. The soft ''д'' and ''ц'' sounds have light shades of ''дз'' and ''ц'' sounds (not so in Russian or Ukrainian). Similarly, the soft ''з'' and ''с'' sounds are pronounced with shades of ''ж'' and ''ш'' respectively.

==Possessives==

Here is a chart of all Belarusian possessives, with their gender and number modifications.

The forms in parentheses are more common in colloquial speech, while the other are slightly more formal.

'''Мой саба́ка стары́'''. My dog is old.

'''Твае́ кнігі ціка́выя'''. Your books are interesting.

'''Яе́ го́лас прыго́жы'''. Her voice is beautiful.

'''На́ша ха́та но́вая'''. Our house is new.

'''Ва́шае акно́ шыро́кае'''. Your window is broad.

The possessives can be used not only as noun attributes, but as pronouns as well. Consider the examples below.

'''Гэ́та мая́ пра́ца.''' This is my work.

'''Гэ́тая пра́ца мая́.''' This work is mine.

==Asking about Possession and Properties==

To ask about possession, a question word ''чый'' can be used. It is deflected by gender and number.

'''Чый гэ́та ало́вак? - Гэ́та мой ало́вак. Ён мой.''' Whose pencil is this? It is my pencil. It is mine.

'''Чыё гэ́та дрэ́ва? - Гэ́та на́шае дрэ́ва. Яно́ на́ша.''' Whose tree is that? It is our tree. It is ours.

'''Чыя́ гэ́та кніга? - Гэ́та ва́шая кніга. Яна́ ва́ша.''' Whose book is this? It is your book. It is yours.

'''Чыi гэ́та каты́? - Гэ́та іх каты́. Яны́ іхныя.''' Whose cats are those? Those are their cats. They are theirs.

With ''чый'' both ''гэта'' and ''гэты'' (in an appropriate flexion) can be used. Note a light difference between them.

'''Чыя́ гэ́та зямля́? - Гэ́та на́шая зямля́.''' Whose land is this? This is our land.

'''Чыя́ гэ́тая зямля́? - Яна́ на́ша.''' Whose is this land? It is ours.

Thus, the first variant is more suitable for the first mentioning of the object, while the second more likely corresponds to the situation when the object has already been mentioned before. However, these variants are interchangeable.

The word ''чый'' (in neuter form) can be used alone, when you don't want to name the thing you are asking about (or do not know its name):

'''Чыё гэ́та? - Гэ́та маё.''' Whose is this (i.e. what I am pointing at)? Its mine.

Another question word, ''які'', is used to ask about properties.

'''Які гэ́та го́рад? - Гэ́та вялікі го́рад.''' What kind of town is that? It is a big town.

'''Яко́е гэ́та по́ле? - Гэ́та шыро́кае по́ле.''' What kind of field is that? It is a broad field.

'''Якая гэ́та ка́зка? - Гэ́та ціка́вая ка́зка.''' What kind of tale is this? This is an interesting tale.

'''Які́я гэ́та пту́шкі? - Гэ́та прыго́жыя пту́шкі.''' What kind of birds are those? Those are beautiful birds.

The word ''які'' may imply an answer containing a description, or an answer containing a definition. E.g. with the question

'''Яка́я гэ́та краіна?''' What (what kind of) country is this?

the following answers are equally correct.

'''Гэ́та вялікая краіна.''' This is a big country.

'''Гэ́та Фра́нцыя.''' This is France.

To emphasise that you want to hear a definition, not a description, you may use a ''што ... за'' construction (note, however, that it is a colloquialism).

'''Што гэ́та за го́рад? - Гэ́та Мінск.''' What city is this? This is Minsk.

'''Што гэ́та за мо́ра? - Гэ́та Балты́йскае мо́ра.''' What sea is this? This is the Baltic sea.

'''Што гэ́та за пту́шкі? - Гэ́та саро́кі.''' What birds are those? Those are magpies.

With people, it is not polite to use ''што ... за''. You should use ''хто'' instead.

'''Хто гэ́ты чалаве́к? - Гэ́та дырэ́ктар.''' Who is this person? This is the manager.

'''Хто гэ́тыя лю́дзі? - Гэ́та мае́ выкла́дчыкі.''' Who are these people? These are my lecturers.

Notice that ''людзі'' is the plural for ''чалавек''.

'''Aam panna''' is a green mango drink widely consumed in northern India during summer months. Apart from being delicious and refreshing, aam panna is believed to have several health benefits.

The recipe calls for green mangoes, sugar, rock salt, roasted cumin seeds and mint leaves. The quantities can (and should) be varied to suit individual taste preferences. This recipe yields a concentrate which can be stored for around 2 weeks in the refrigerator.

== Ingredients ==
*4 medium-sized green [[Cookbook:Mango|mangoes]]
*½ cup (120 mL) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*2 level tablespoons (30 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|rock salt]]
*1 level teaspoon (5 mL) roasted [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seeds
*1 roasted [[Cookbook:Chili|chili]] 
*A handful of fresh [[Cookbook:Mint|mint]] leaves

== Procedure ==
#Cut mangoes into 3 slices each - two from either side of the seed and one with the seed in it.
#[[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|Pressure cook]] mangoes with one small cup of water. Turn off heat as soon as the pressure cooker whistles once.
#Open cooker after 5-7 minutes and leave to cool.
#Alternatively roast the whole mangoes over an open flame, till the skin gets chared and the flesh is soft. The charred skin will peel off easily and you can squeeze out the pulp with your hands. This gives a nice smoky flavour to the dish.
#Grind sugar and roasted cumin seeds using a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]]. (If using chilli, grind that too.)
#Mince mint leaves in a food processor.
#When cool, squeeze pulp of mangoes into a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] using hands. Discard skin and seeds.
#[[Cookbook:Purée|Purée]] mango pulp until smooth.
#Add ground sugar, rock salt, roasted cumin seeds, chilli powder and minced mint leaves. Blend well.
#Store in clean plastic/ glass bottle. Refrigerate.

To serve, add 4-5 teaspoons of concentrate to a glass of water. Enjoy!

This a very easy and tasty [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] [[Cookbook:Sauces|sauce]]. It's good with just pasta, and goes well with a lot of vegetables as well. The quantities of ingredients varies with the amount of pasta, and with your taste preferences.

== Ingredients ==
*[[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves
*ripe [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
*fresh [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]
*[[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
# add whatever you want

== Procedure ==
#Finely chop tomatoes or [[Cookbook:Purée|purée]] them in a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]] – this depends on what consistency you want. Chopping gives a chunkier sauce while using puréed tomatoes yields a smoother sauce.
#Grind garlic to paste.
#Heat oil in a pan. Using a pan with non-stick coating needs less oil.
#When oil is hot (but not too hot), turn down heat and add garlic paste.
#When garlic is golden-brown, add tomatoes.
#Tomatoes have to be cooked until done - they'll look and smell cooked instead of raw, and will be a deeper, redder colour.
#Half way there, add salt and pepper.
#When tomatoes are almost done, add fresh cream (more if you want, but less is good too).
#After half a minute, add oregano.
#Cook for another minute, and your pasta sauce is ready.
#Add cooked pasta and vegetables and serve hot.
# add herbs e.g. basil, rosemary

      <text xml:space="preserve">The opportunity cost of capital is the amount of money you forego by investing money in one asset compared to another. For eg. If you have only two alternatives
         a) Invest in an asset which gives 5% return
         b) Invest in another asset which gives 6% return
If you choose the first option, you wont be able to take advantage of the second option. The difference between what you are earning and what you could be earning is the opportunity cost of capital. In this scenario it is 1% (6%-1%).
Take another example: say you have a piece of land kept idle. If you make a warehouse over it ,then you cannot use it for any other purpose. So, you miss the earning possibility from any alternative use. That is your opportunity cost.

{{Wikipedia|Seven Wonders of the World}}

The &quot;seven wonders of the world&quot; was a list of spectacular buildings and structures, compiled by Greek authors. The list that we currently use today was compiled by historians in the 6th century AD from the original Greek writings. Because all the original sources were Greek, all of the wonders in the list are located in Greece and surrounding areas by the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea.

With the exception of the great pyramid all the seven wonders have been destroyed by natural disaster, predominantly fires and earthquakes.

The first surviving Greek record of the seven wonders was given by Antipater of Sidon, who wrote about them in a poem:

{{TextBox|&lt;center&gt;''I have set eyes on the wall of lofty Babylon on which is a road for chariots, and the statue of Zeus by the Alpheus, and the hanging gardens, and the Colossus of the Sun, and the huge labour of the high pyramids, and the vast tomb of Mausolus; but when I saw the house of Artemis that mounted to the clouds, those other marvels lost their brilliancy, and I said, 'Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked on aught so grand.' ''&lt;/center&gt;}}

This original list includes Babylon's Ishtar Gate instead of the lighthouse at Alexandria, although later lists exclude the gate in favor of the lighthouse.

== Biography: Antipater of Sidon ==

Every page is going to include at least historical vignette about one of the people (or a group of people) who are associated with that wonder. Because Antipater of Sidon is the earliest surviving record of the seven wonders being listed, we will discuss him here.

{{Wikipedia|Antipater of Sidon}}
'''Antipater of Sidon''' (2nd century BC) is an ancient Greek writer and poet best known for his list of Seven Wonders of the World. He and the mathematician and engineer Philo of Byzantium (born about 280 BC) are known as the most famous observers of the Seven Wonders. Antipater's poem describes the 7 Magnificent Wonders he had seen, the ones we call the 7 wonders even today.  For the idea of 7 monuments that show the significance of mankind was so greatly treasured it was kept alive...family to family...generation to generation. Then in around AD 1500 the Renaissance in Europe became interested in ancient times, and miraculously Antipater’s poem and many other short poems or stories of Greek marvels were rediscovered. It is from these rediscovered poems and descriptions that much of our current knowledge of the seven wonders exists today.</text>

{{Wikipedia|Great Pyramid of Giza}}
[[Image:Cairo, Gizeh, Sphinx and Pyramid of Khufu, Egypt, Oct 2004.jpg|left|thumb|The Great Pyramid and the Sphinx.]]
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing today. Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead Pharaoh. The Giza Plateau, or &quot;Giza Necropolis&quot; in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.

== Biography: Khufu ==

[[Image:Khufu.JPG|right|300px]]

Khufu was the son of King Sneferu, and Queen Hetepheres. Khufu is remembered as a cruel and ruthless Pharaoh in later folklore. Khufu had nine sons, one of whom, Djedefra, was his immediate successor.

It is generally thought that Khufu came to the throne in his twenties. Accounts differ on how long he was Pharaoh, with accounts claiming he ruled for anywhere between about 23 years to 65 years. He started building his pyramid at Giza, the first to be built in that place. Based on inscriptional evidence, it is also likely that he led military expeditions into the Sinai, Nubia and Libya.

The Westcar Papyrus, which was written well after his reign during the Middle Kingdom or later, depicts the Pharaoh being told magical tales by his sons Khafra and Djedefra. This story cycle depicts Khufu as mean and cruel, and is ultimately frustrated in his attempts to ensure that his dynasty survives past his two sons. Whether or not this story cycle is true is unknown, But Khufu's negative reputation lasted at least until the time of Herodotus, who was told further stories of that king's cruelty to his people and to his own family in order to ensure the construction of his pyramid. What is known for certain is that his funerary cult lasted until the 26th Dynasty, which was one of the last native-Egyptian royal dynasties, almost 2,000 years after his death.

{{Wikipedia|Khufu}}

Most likenesses of Khufu are lost to history. Only one miniature statuette (right) has been fully attributed to this Pharaoh. Since he is credited with building the single largest building of ancient times, it is ironic that the only positively identified royal sculpture of his is also the smallest that has ever been found: a 7.6cm (3 inch) ivory statue that bears his name. It was discovered not at Giza, but in a temple in Abydos during an excavation by William Matthew Flinders Petrie in 1903. Originally this piece was found without the head, but bearing the Pharaoh's name. Realizing the importance of this discovery, Petrie halted all further excavation on the site until the head was found three weeks later. This statue is now on display in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo.

The Giza plateau is an area outside of modern day Cairo. Because of the several pyramids, tombs, and graveyards on the plateau, the area is commonly known as the &quot;Giza Necroplex&quot;. The plateau itself is part of the town of Giza.

{{Wikipedia|Giza}}

Giza is 20 miles away from the Nile river, and has become part of the Cairo metropolis. Many images of the Giza plateau show a vast desert, but modern day Giza is a thriving town with a substantial population. During British colonization in the 19th and early 20th centuries, many roads and buildings were constructed in the area to help support the local commerce.

[[image:ogrody_semiramidy.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Gardens of Semiramis, 20th century interpretation]]

The '''Hanging Gardens of Babylon''' (also known as '''the Hanging Gardens of [[Semiramis]]''') and the walls of [[Babylon]] (approx. present-day [[Iraq]]) were considered one of the [[Seven Wonders of the World]].  They were both supposedly built by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] around [[600 BC]] . 

The Hanging Gardens are extensively documented by [[Greece|Greek]] [[history|historians]] such as [[Strabo]] and [[Diodorus Siculus]], but otherwise there is little evidence for their existence.  Some (circumstantial) evidence gathered at the excavation of the palace at Babylon has been accrued, but does not completely substantiate what look like fanciful descriptions.

Some schools of thought think that through the ages the location may have been confused with gardens that existed at [[Nineveh]] as tablets from there clearly showing gardens have been found. Writings on these tablets describe the possible use of something similar to an [[Archimedes' screw]] as a process of raising the water to the required height.

According to accounts, the gardens were built to cheer up Nebuchadnezzar's homesick wife, [[Amyitis]]. Amyitis, daughter of the king of the Medes, was married to Nebuchadnezzar to create an alliance between the nations. The land she came from, though, was green, rugged and mountainous, and she found the flat, sun-baked terrain of the [[Mesopotamia]] (a region of southwest Asia) depressing. The king decided to recreate her homeland by building an artificial mountain with rooftop gardens. 

The Hanging Gardens probably did not really &quot;hang&quot; in the sense of being suspended from cables or ropes. The name comes from an inexact translation of the Greek word [[kremastos]] or the Latin word [[pensilis]], which means not just &quot;hanging&amp;#8221; but &quot;overhanging,&quot; as in the case of a terrace or balcony. 

The Greek geographer [[Strabo]], who described the gardens in the first century BC, wrote, &quot;It consists of vaulted terraces raised one above another, and resting upon cube-shaped pillars. These are hollow and filled with earth to allow trees of the largest size to be planted. The pillars, [[vault]]s, and terraces are constructed of baked brick and asphalt.&quot;

If the gardens did exist they would have presented an amazing spectacle: A green, leafy, artificial mountain rising off the plain.</text>

{{Wikipedia|Hanging Gardens of Babylon}}

Of all the seven wonders, the hanging gardens of Babylon are perhaps the most elusive. In fact, besides writings from Greek historians, there are no records and no evidence to prove that the hanging gardens of Babylon ever existed. There are not even any Babylonian records or accounts of any hanging gardens.

Tradition says that the hanging gardens were constructed by king Nebuchadnezzar II as a gift for his wife Amyitis of Media.

Large gardens did exist at Nineveh, and it is believed by some historians that accounts of the hanging gardens of Babylon actually referred to the gardens at Nineveh. Tablets recovered from archeological digs at Ninevah show large above-ground gardens, and writings from tablets at Nineveh describe devices similar to Archimedies' Screws that could be used to bring water to the gardens above.

== Biography: Nebuchadnezzar II ==
[[Image:Nebukadnessar II.jpg|thumb]]

Nebuchadnezzar II (sometimes also written as Nebuchadrezzar II) was a king of ancient babylon who reigned c. 605 BC-562 BC. He is famous for his conquests of Judah and Jerusalem, his monumental building within his capital of Babylon, his role in the [[w:Book of Daniel|Book of Daniel]], and his construction of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, which as legend has it, he made for his wife Amytis of Media because she was homesick for the mountain springs where she grew up.

He is traditionally called &quot;Nebuchadnezzar the Great&quot;, but his destruction of temples in Jerusalem and the conquest of Judah caused his vilification in Judaic tradition and in the Bible, (Daniel 1:1; Prophecied Jeremiah 25:11) causing him to be interpreted very differently by western Christians and Jews than in contemporary Iraq, where he is glorified as an historic leader.

== Location: Babylon ==

{{Wikipedia|Babylon}}

Babylon was an ancient city in Mesopotamia (modern Al Hillah, Iraq), the ruins of which can be found in present-day Babil Province, about 80km south of Baghdad. The city itself was built upon the Euphrates, and divided in equal parts along its left and right banks, with steep embankments to contain the river's seasonal floods. Babylon grew in extent and grandeur over time, but gradually became subject to the rule of Assyria. 

During the reign of Sennacherib of Assyria, Babylonia was in a constant state of revolt, led by Mushezib-Marduk, and suppressed only by the complete destruction of the city of Babylon. With the recovery of Babylonian independence, a new era of architectural activity ensued, and Nebuchadnezzar II made Babylon into one of the wonders of the ancient world. Nebuchadnezzar ordered the complete reconstruction of the imperial grounds, including rebuilding the Etemenanki ziggurat and the construction of the Ishtar Gate — the most spectacular of eight gates that ringed the perimeter of Babylon. The Ishtar Gate survives today in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.

In 539 BC the Neo-Babylonian Empire fell to Cyrus the Great, king of Persia. It is said that Cyrus walked through the gates of Babylon without encountering any resistance.

In 331 BC, Darius III was defeated by the forces of the Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great at the Battle of Gaugamela, and in October, Babylon fell to the young conqueror. A native account of this invasion notes a ruling by Alexander not to enter the homes of its inhabitants.

Under Alexander, Babylon again flourished as a centre of learning and commerce. But following Alexander's death in 323 BC in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar, his empire was divided amongst his generals, and decades of fighting soon began, with Babylon once again caught in the middle.</text>

{{Wikipedia|Statue of Zeus at Olympia}}

The statue of Zeus from the temple at Olympia was a gigantic statue constructed by Phidias in the fifth century BCE. It was constructed of a wooden frame covered in carved ivory with gold accents. 
[[Image:Statue of Zeus.jpg|thumb|right]]
In the sculpture, he was seated on a magnificent throne of cedarwood, inlaid with ivory, gold, ebony, and precious stones. In Zeus' right hand there was a small statue of Nike, the goddess of victory, and in his left hand, a shining sceptre on which an eagle perched. Plutarch, in his Life of the Roman general Aemilius Paulus, records that the victor over Macedon &quot;was moved to his soul, as if he had beheld the god in person,&quot; while the Greek orator Dio Chrysostom wrote that a single glimpse of the statue would make a man forget his earthly troubles.
[[Image:Zeus Hermitage St. Petersburg 20021009.jpg|thumb|left]]
The temple of Zeus, where the statue stood, was destroyed by fire in the fourth century BCE, although some scholars believe that the statue had been moved to Constantinople before the fire, and was later destroyed there.

{{wikipedia|Temple of Artemis}}

[[Image:Ac artemisephesus.jpg|400px]]

The temple of Artemis at Ephesus was a large stone temple constructed around 550 BCE.

The temple of Artemis at Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BCE in an act of arson committed by Herostratus. According to the story, his motivation was fame at any cost. The Ephesians, outraged, announced that Herostratus' name never be recorded. The Greek historian Strabo later noted the name, which is how we know today. The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great was born. Alexander, as king, offered to pay to rebuild the temple, but his offer was denied. Later, after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE.

The new temple was destroyed by the Goths in 262 BCE. The temple was rebuilt again, only to collapse &lt;s&gt;during a sermon by Paul of Tarsus.&lt;/s&gt; during a dispute between followers of Artemis and the Apostle John (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_John Acts of John]) This event causes the eventual disbanding of the cult of Artemis, and the mass conversion of the Ephesians to christianity.

{{Wikipedia|Mausoleum of Maussollos}}

The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, also known as the Mausoleum of Maussollos was a tomb built in the fourth century BCE in honor of Mausolus and his wife Artemisia. The Mausoleum stood approximately 135 feet tall, and each wall was adorned with carvings by one of four great Greek sculptors.

== Etymology: &quot;Mausoleum&quot; ==

The word &quot;Mausoleum&quot; is actually a combination of the original Greek words &quot;Mausol&quot; and &quot;eion&quot;, or &quot;dedicated to Mausol&quot;. Because this tomb was so grand, all other large tombs have been known as mausoleums.

== Biography: Mausolus ==

The Mausoleum is dedicated to a man named '''Mausolus''', who was a Persian Governor of Anatolia. In addition to creating many new cities, buildings and other large construction projects, Mausolus founded the city of Halicarnassus to be the capital of Anatolia. Mausolus, as was custom among Persian officials at the time, married his sister Artemisia. After Mausolus' death, Artemisia finished constructing the large mausoleum in his honor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Seven Wonders}}

The Colossus at Rhodes, a gigantic statue of the Greek god Helios, was constructed in the third century BCE. The statue stood over 30 meters tall at the mouth of the harbor at Rhodes. After Alexander the Great died, his empire was broken into several pieces by his generals. Ptolemy, who was in control of Rhodes and Egypt, controlled much of the commerce on the Mediteranean. Fighting broke out between Ptolemy at Rhodes and another of Alexander's generals. After the fighting was over, the vicorious Rhodians used war plunder to construct the Colossus.

The statue was constructed by Chares of Lindos out of a combination of stone, iron, and bronze. Large stone support pillars were erected at the mouth of the harbour, and embedded with iron cross-bars. The iron bars then were covered with sculpted bronze plates to form the finished colossus.

An earthquake in 226 BCE destroyed the statue, which cracked at the knees and fell onto the land. The Rhodians choose not to rebuild it because the Oracle at Delphi warned that it would anger the god Helios. The statue lay on the ground untouched for over 800 years, and was a popular tourist attraction. In 654 an Arab force under Muawiyah I captured Rhodes and the remains were sold to a traveling salesman from Edessa. The buyer had the statue broken down, and transported the bronze scrap on the backs of 900 camels to his home. Pieces continued to turn up for sale for years, after being found along the caravan route.

{{Wikipedia|Lighthouse of Alexandria}}

The Pharos, also known as the lighthouse of Alexandria was a large lighthouse that served as a navigational aide for ships entering the city. The precise height of the lighthouse is not known, but it is estimated by scientists and archeologists to have been between 115 meters and 180 meters tall. The top end of that estimate would have the lighthouse being taller then the great pyramid and therefore the tallest building in the ancient world. The lower end of the estimation, 115 meters, would have been the third largest building in the world, after the great pyramid and the pyramid of Khafra.

The Lighthouse was built on a small island known as Pharos off the coast of Alexandria. The island was connected to the mainland by a man-made connector that formed one side of the Alexandrian harbor. Because the egyptian coast line was so flat and featureless, the lighthouse was an important navigational aide for sailors.

The structure was originally designed as being simply a tall tower to serve as a marker, but fire and mirrors were added to make it a true lighthouse in the first century BCE.

Earthquakes in 1303 and 1323 CE turned the lighthouse into a ruin. In 1480 Qaitbay the sultan of Egypt built a medieval fort on the former location of the building, using some of the fallen stone. The remnants of the Pharos that were incorporated into the walls of Fort Qaitbey are clearly visible due to their excessive size in comparison to surrounding masonry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Species Counterpoint''' is that method of teaching laid out most famously by Johann Joseph Fux in his treatise, ''Gradus ad Parnassum''. Its method relies upon breaking contrapuntal study into five parts for each combination of two, three and four voices. The five parts (or &quot;species&quot;) are as follows:

The first species is note-against-note counterpoint.

The second species is two notes against one in the ''cantus firmus''.

The third species is four notes against one in the ''cantus firmus''.

The fourth species is the study of suspensions against a ''cantus firmus''.

The fifth species describes the combination of the four previous species together against a ''cantus firmus''.

== [[/In Two Voices/]] ==

This is the simplest of possible contrapuntal compositions. It consists of one ''cantus firmus'' and one composed &quot;counterpoint&quot; to it.

== [[/In Three Voices/]] ==

Fux describes three-voice counterpoint as the most perfect because it is the only type in which it is possible to create complete harmonic triads without having to use an extra voice. That is, compositions which use more than three voices end up doubling triadic pitches, like the octave and the third. Put another way, three voice composition is the most perfect because it is the only way to express complete harmonic triads using a minimum of voices.

== [[/In Four Voices/]] ==

Four voice contrapuntal composition necessarily requires that, at least in harmonic triads, one of the voices be doubled. An exception arises in the creation of dissonant chords, like the dominant seventh chord.

== [[/More Than Four Voices/]] ==

Fux ends his book with the treatment of florid counterpoint (5th species) in four voices. Compositions which treat five or more voices are not much different than those treating four voices (and we know that treating four voices is not much different than treating three). Greater care must be taken in composing in more than four voices because as the texture becomes thicker, so it becomes more prone to error. All rules which apply to four voice writing also apply to all writing beyond four voices. If you write with more than four voices it might turn out strangely because you will have to double up a lot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Things to Consider ==

===== Cantus Firmus =====
One contrapuntal line is always composed against another given line. This given voice is called the ''cantus firmus''. This line may be taken from a book of chorales, as Fux suggests, may be provided by a teacher, may be composed by the student him/herself or may be taken from the work of a master.

===== Consonance =====
In writing counterpoint, it is important to note which consonances are being formed, for they produce what the ear hears as harmony. Fux lists five consonances, in two categories, to be used in the writing of counterpoint according to the rules he has laid down.

:; Perfect Consonances : Include the unison and octave, along with the fifth

:; Imperfect Consonances : Include the major/minor third, and the major/minor sixth

:; Dissonances : Include the major/minor second, the fourth, the augmented fourth, the diminished fifth, and the major/minor seventh

===== Motion =====
Motion in music is what creates interest. The establishment of tonal relationships is impossible without it, and the harmony created by the melodic motion of independent voices is what establishes these relationships. There are only three kinds of motion possible in one voice relative to another.

:; Direct Motion : The voices move in the same direction by stepping or skipping. '''Parallel Motion''' is a subset of '''Direct Motion''' wherein both voices move in the same direction by the same amount (the vertical interval between them does not change).

:; Contrary Motion : One voice moves up in pitch while the other moves down in pitch.

:; Oblique Motion : One voice moves up or down by step or skip while the other voice does not move.

Variety is important in music. This holds true for rhythm, harmony and melodic motion. Judicious use of the three types of motion creates variety and helps minimize the possibility of motivic stagnation.

== General Rules ==

Fux's rules about contrapuntal motion under specific circumstances are four in number.

:; First Rule : Only proceed from perfect consonance to perfect consonance in contrary or oblique motion.

:; Second Rule : Any of the three motions is permitted if moving from a perfect consonance to an imperfect consonance.

:; Third Rule : Only proceed from imperfect consonance to perfect consonance in contrary or oblique motion.

:; Fourth Rule : Any of the three motions is permitted if moving from an imperfect consonance to an imperfect consonance.

Those who read closely may find that these four rules may be condensed into a single rule.

:; Rule : Any motion is allowed except for the direct motion into a perfect consonance.

Progressing into the subject of counterpoint, several other &quot;general rules&quot; exist. These usually regard perfect consonances in one way or another. However, direct motion into perfect consonances will ''always'' be forbidden in the Common Practice style.

== First Species - Note Against Note ==

First Species counterpoint is note against note counterpoint. That is to say that for every note in the [[cantus firmus]] there is one note in the added harmony. Rules for species counterpoint are grouped hard and soft. Hard rules may not be broken whereas soft rules may be broken if it will avoid violating a hard rule, though the better solution is one that breaks no rules.

&lt;u&gt;The hard rules:&lt;/u&gt;

1) For every note of the cantus firmus there is one note in the counterpoint

2) No accidentals may be used (except rule 5)

3) All harmonies must be consonant (a perfect fourth is considered a dissonance)

4) The first interval must be any perfect harmony and the last an octave or unison

5) The last interval must be approached by motion of a minor second upwards (note rule 7 may not be broken)

6) All perfect intervals must be approached by contrary motion

7) Motion can proceed by step or leap but steps and leaps of augmented and diminished intervals and leaps of any seventh are forbidden. Leaps greater than an sixth are forbidden except for leaps of an octave which should be rare

8) The counterpoint may not outline an interval of a tritone or seventh except for an augmented fourth that is fully, stepwise outlined and precedes an inwards step

&lt;u&gt;The soft rules:&lt;/u&gt;

1) No note may be repeated successively more than three times

2) No two successive leaps in the same direction may total more than an octave

3) While ascending, in the case of two successive steps or leaps, the larger one should precede the smaller; while descending the smaller should precede the larger

4) No successive leaps in opposite directions; leaps should be followed by inward, stepwise motion

5) The same harmonic interval should not repeat more than three times

6) There should be no more than two successive leaps

7) The range of the counterpoint should be limited to a tenth and all notes in the chosen mode should appear in the counterpoint

== Second Species - Two Notes Against One ==


== Third Species - Three/Four Notes Against One ==

== Fourth Species - Suspensions ==

== Fifth Species - Florid Counterpoint ==

__NOTOC__

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Egg|Eggs]]

===Warnings===
* Unwashed eggs will keep 4-5 weeks in the coldest part of the refrigerator
* Boiled or washed eggs will only keep about a week-the protective cover over the shell is gone.
* Look at your eggs BEFORE you put them in your grocery cart! Never buy cracked or even dirty eggs.
* Hard-boiled eggs left out too long should not be eaten, i.e., hard-boiled Easter eggs should not be eaten unless the contents of the egg are blown out and cooked separately.

==Procedure==
# Put the eggs in a pot.
# Fill pot with water. Make sure that the tops of the eggs are covered by at least 25 mm (one inch).
# Bring to a rolling boil.
# Reduce heat to a low boil.
# Cook for 10 to 15 minutes -- depending on the size and number of eggs.
# Drain the pot.
# Cool eggs immediately by running cold water over them or putting in iced water.
# Crack and peel the eggs under very cold running water, starting by cracking the large (air pocket) end, then taking off the largest pieces first.
Lowering the eggs' temperature keeps the shells from sticking, and prevents the greenish tinge sometimes seen on hard-boiled eggs. (The greenish tinge doesn't affect taste or safety, and does not indicate decay or toxicity. Instead, it is due to the reaction between iron and sulphur from the egg white and yolk.)

===Tips, Notes, and Variations===
* An alternate method is to turn off the heat, cover the pot, and let stand 15 or 18 minutes.
* Salt in the water can help keep egg white from seeping out of a crack.
* Multiple layers of eggs in the pot are more likely to crack: use only a single layer and do another batch.
* Older eggs will be easier to peel, as the air space is larger.
* If the peeling becomes tragic, you can always make egg salad or bird food!

In this tutorial, you will learn how to make a simple toy-like house with a fence around it. You will learn how to use ''array modifiers'' to replicate the palings of the fence, saving you from duplicating them one by one.

This tutorial is based on Bart Veldhuizen's &quot;Building a House&quot; from Tutorial #01 published by NaN in 1999 which is also available in a PDF at http://download.blender.org/documentation/BlenderTutorialGuide1.tar.gz (a tar.gz containing BlenderTutorialGuide1.pdf) or http://download.blender.org/documentation/BlenderTutorialGuide1.zip (a ZIP file containing the same PDF).

Permission was asked to use it and Ton Roosendaal said &quot;Be assured that everything that was produced by NaN now is open and free content for everyone to reuse, including the tutorial “Building a House”.&quot;

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.67}}

== Setting the Scene ==
[[File:Blender267Split3DView.png|right|300px]]

Start a new document ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|N}}). Split the view into four views as at right, by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|CTRL|Q}}. This gives you a standard set of views: top, front, side and camera, the first three orthographic and the last one in perspective. You can switch back to the single 3D view at any time by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|CTRL|Q}} again.

Leave the default cube, it will be the walls of the house.

{{Clear}}

== Make the Roof ==
[[File:Blender267HouseRoofCube.png|right|300px]]

Ensure you are in '''object''' mode ({{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} switches between object and edit mode)

Now, in the Front view window (lower left)

Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|DKEY}} to duplicate the cube, grab mode is automatically selected, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ZKEY}} to restrict the move to the up-down axis and move the cube to rest on top of the original (pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} while moving will snap it to the grid and make it easier to position accurately.) Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}} when it is in place.

You can see how useful this four-paned window is; it shows you exactly what's going on. 

Note: It helps to simply grab one of the arrows, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ZKEY}} and then press 2 on the key pad, this will move the block 2 units in the z direction. the standard starting cube is 2 units tall.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Make sure you are duplicating the cube in Object mode, not Edit mode, so the roof ends up as a separate object.}}

{{Clear}}

[[File:Blender267HouseRoofCubeEdit.png|right|300px]]

The top cube is going to become the roof and needs to be given a triangular cross-section.

Select the top cube (if it is not already selected) by clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on it

Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} to go into '''Edit''' Mode (check the box in the middle of the 3D window header)

Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|AKEY}} to deselect all the vertices.

In the top view, select the top four ({{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} the first one and {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|RMB}} the rest). You can check in the other views that only those four are selected.

Note: another way to do this is to have &quot;limit selection to visible&quot; turned off, and then press the {{B3D:N2P/Do|BKEY}} for, border select, and make a box around the top vertices. (it helps to view it from one of the sides, by pressing either the 1 or 3 keys)

Another Note:  Or, with 'limit selection to visible&quot; turned on, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|CKEY}} for circle select and turn the mouse key to make the circle large enough to enclose all four vertices before you press {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}.

{{Clear}}

===Make the Apex of the Roof===
[[File:Blender267HouseRoofApex.png|right|300px]]

Now press {{B3D:N2P/Do|SKEY}} for scaling and {{B3D:N2P/Do|XKEY}} to limit the scaling to the X-axis (left to right). You could try to move the mouse back and forth to bring the top vertices together, but you will have a hard time lining them up exactly, so it's best to just type in  {{B3D:N2P/Do|0KEY}} (zero) followed by {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}} to set scaling to zero.

Now it looks like there are only 2 vertices where there were 4, but in fact there are still 4, even though 2 of them are occupying exactly the same positions as the other 2. With these 4 still selected, bring up the vertex specials menu with {{B3D:N2P/Do|WKEY}} and select “Remove Doubles”. You should see a message briefly flash up at the top right saying “Removed 2 vertices”. Now there really are only 2 vertices where there previously were 4.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|“Remove Doubles” is a handy function to use after complicated mesh edits. It helps reduce complexity in your mesh structure.}}

{{Clear}}

===Form the Eaves===
[[File:Blender267HouseRoofEaves.png|right|300px]]

The roof needs to project over the walls of the house to form the eaves. To do this, we will scale it, but only along the X- and Y-axes, not the Z, so it doesn’t become taller.

Select all the vertices in the roof object by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|AKEY}} once or twice.

Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|SKEY}} to scale, followed by {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|ZKEY}} to scale uniformly along all axes ''except'' Z, and scale to about 1.1. Confirm the operation with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}} in the usual way.

{{Clear}}

==Naming the Roof and House Objects==
In a complex project with lots of objects, it can be helpful to keep them straight by giving them names. This is less of an issue in a simple tutorial like this one, but for practice, let’s give names to your objects anyway.

Go to the Object context [[File:Blender255ObjectContextButton.png]] in the Properties window, and at the top you should see an editable field containing the name of the currently-selected object. The walls of the house should be called “Cube”, and the roof should be called “Cube.001” (note the automatic addition of a numeric suffix to keep the names unique). Try changing these to, say, “House” and “Roof” respectively.

=== Object Name Versus Mesh Name ===
If you look in the Mesh Data context [[File:Blender267MeshDataContextButton.png]], you will also see a name like “Cube” or “Cube.001”. This is a separate name for the object-type-specific data (the mesh data, in this case), quite independent of the object name. Don’t worry about this name for now; you will learn about its significance [[../Blender Memory Management|later]].

{{Clear}}

==Colouring the House==
The roof now needs to be given a different colour to the default grey. Select the Materials Context [[File:Blender255MaterialContextButton.png]] in the Object Properties window. In the list at the top, you should see a single entry, called “Material” (the name of the initial default material). Below that is an editable field containing the name, and immediately to its right should be a small box with the number “2” in it. This number indicates that the same material is being used in two places—in this case, we know the other place is the object representing the walls of the house. Click on this “2”, and that will force a new copy of the material to be made (leaving the house walls with the original); the number will disappear, and the material name will change to “Material.001” to be different from the original.

[[File:Blender267HouseRoofMaterial.png|thumb]]

Change this material name to “RoofRed”, to make it clearer what it is for. Next, find the panel “Diffuse” further down, showing a swatch of the diffuse (non-reflective) colour, which is initially white. Click on this to bring up a colour picker, and choose some suitable shade of red for the roof.  (Notice that when using shades of red, the white to black slider on the right actually creates shades of brown from the red.)  As you do this, the 3D view should instantly update to show your new colour being applied to the roof of the house. If you want to exit the colour picker and leave the colour unchanged, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ESC}}; otherwise, to confirm your choice, simply move the mouse outside the picker window, and it will close, leaving your last-chosen colour in effect.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender267HouseWallsMaterial.png|thumb]]

Follow a similar procedure to choose the colour for the house walls: click the “House” object with {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} in one of the 3D views, go to the Materials Context [[File:Blender255MaterialContextButton.png]] in Object Properties, change the material name from “Material” to something more appropriate (here I’m choosing “HouseSandy” because I’m going to give the house walls a sandy-yellow colour), click on the colour swatch in the “Diffuse” panel and choose a suitable colour for this material.
'''Noob Note:''' I have found it very useful, when I re-name anything, to type my new name in ALL CAPS.  This makes it easier for me to pick out what I have done.

[[File:Blender267HouseColoured.png|right|300px]]

Your house should look like this now.

{{Clear}}

==Make a Chimney==
[[File:Blender267HousePlusChimney.png|right|300px]]

Go into Object mode, if you're not already in it.
({{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} flips between object and edit mode.)

Go to the Front view (lower left window).

Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} to position the 3D cursor on the right-hand side of the roof, this will select the spot where the chimney will be created. 

Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|A}} to Add → Mesh → Cube from the popup menu &amp;mdash; a bit large, isn't it?

Scale it along the X and Y ({{B3D:N2P/Do|SKEY}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|ZKEY}}) to about 0.2. 

Now grab it ({{B3D:N2P/Do|GKEY}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|XKEY}}) and move it into position looking at the front view (lower left window). (Feel free to use the mouse wheel to zoom in the view to make things easier to see.)

When this is correct, move it into position along the Y axis ({{B3D:N2P/Do|GKEY}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|YKEY}}) looking at the top view (upper left window). 

You can check the side view (lower right window) and the camera view (upper right window) to see that it looks OK.

{{Clr}}

===Name and Colour the Chimney===

In the Object context [[File:Blender255ObjectContextButton.png]] in the Object Properties window, change the name of the chimney object to &quot;Chimney&quot;.

Next in the Materials Context [[File:Blender255MaterialContextButton.png]] in the Object Properties window, you will notice there are no buttons, and there is an icon [[File:Blender267MaterialsPopupIcon.png]], and next to that a button with the word &quot;New&quot; in it. You can now choose to have the chimney a different colour to the roof or the house or reuse one of these colours.

If you want a new colour, the &quot;New&quot; button, and it will create a new material with a default name and settings. You can rename this and give it an appropriate colour.

If you want to reuse the same colour, you can click on the icon [[File:Blender267MaterialsPopupIcon.png]] and select from the available materials, namely &quot;RoofRed&quot; and &quot;HouseSandy&quot;.
{{Clear}}

== Adding a Window ==

===Make the Window Frame=== 
[[File:Blender267HousePlusWindow.png|right|300px]]

Be in Object mode.

Using the front and top views, click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} to place the 3D cursor where you want the window to go: use the top view to place it against the front wall, and the front view to place it a little to the left and up from the centre of the wall. (Of course, it’s easy enough to reposition the window after you’ve created it, so exact initial placement is not critical.)

In the front view (lower left) add a plane: {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|AKEY}} Mesh → Plane). This will initially be laying flat, facing upwards instead of forwards; to fix this, just rotate it 90° about the X-axis:  {{B3D:N2P/Do|R}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|X}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|9KEY}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|0KEY}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}.

Scale {{B3D:N2P/Do|SKEY}} it down to 0.4, and press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}

To give it a rectangular shape, scale the plane by about 0.8 along the X-axis {{B3D:N2P/Do|SKEY}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|XKEY}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|0KEY}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|.KEY}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|8KEY}}.

Move it into position ({{B3D:N2P/Do|GKEY}}), using the top and front view, on the left hand side of the house a little higher than midway. 

{{Clear}}

Be in the Side View window (lower right).

Move the plane along the Y-axis ({{B3D:N2P/Do|GKEY}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|YKEY}}) until it is just in front of the house. You may want to zoom in ({{B3D:N2P/Do|MW}}) to see better.

Now, still in Side View, 

Switch to '''Edit''' mode ({{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}})

Extrude the plane towards the house ({{B3D:N2P/Do|EKEY}}, -0.07) until it is embedded in the wall.

{{Clear}}

===Make the Window Sill===
[[File:Blender267HouseBoxSelectWindowFrame.png|thumb|Box-select in progress]]
To make this box into a window frame will require a larger view: move the mouse into the Side View window and zoom in with the mouse wheel.

Deselect all ({{B3D:N2P/Do|AKEY}}) and select the outer (leftmost in the right view) vertices using box select ({{B3D:N2P/Do|BKEY}}).

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender267HouseExtrudeWindowFrame.png|thumb]]
Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|EKEY}} and immediately (without moving the mouse) press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ESC}}. This will extrude, but leave the newly-created vertices on top of the previous ones.

Scale the newly created vertices by 0.9 ({{B3D:N2P/Do|SKEY}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|0KEY}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|.KEY}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|9KEY}}{{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}).

{{Clear}}

[[File:Blender267HouseExtrudeWindowFrame2.png|thumb]]
Extrude again inwards to most of the depth of the box about -.03 to -.05 along the Y axis, depending on how you have your window into the wall({{B3D:N2P/Do|EKEY}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|YKEY}}, -.03, {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}).

This screenshot shows a side view in wireframe mode (use {{B3D:N2P/Do|ZKEY}} to switch wireframe mode on and off).

{{B3D:N2P/Note|The outer panel of the window that you just made cannot be inside the wall, you will see this best on the side view. (if the outer face of the window pane is inside the wall you either won't see any paint/texture you apply, or it will half show up.)}}


{{Clear}}

===Name and Colour the Window Frame Object===
Change the name of the window object, as you previously did for the rest of the house pieces. It will be initially called “Plane” (because that is the kind of mesh object you started with); change it to “WindowFrame”. Also give it a new material, and make it white. Change the material name to “WindowFrame”.

===Make the Window Glass===
The glass of the window has to have a different material from the frame. There are two ways to achieve this: make them separate objects, or make them the same object, with different materials assigned to different faces. We will do the latter.

[[File:Blender267HouseGlassMaterial.png|thumb]]
Deselect all ({{B3D:N2P/Do|AKEY}})

Be in '''Edit''' mode .

Switch into '''Face''' select mode ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|TAB}} -&gt; faces) select mode (you've been in '''Vertex''' select mode up to now)

{{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on the face in the center of the window frame, to select it.

In the Materials Context, click the &quot;+&quot; button next to the list of materials, and where that was previously showing just the “WindowFrame” material, you should see a new blank item appear. The rest of the window will go blank, but the “New” button will appear; click this to create a new material. Give it a colour reminiscent of glass; I chose to colour it light blue (“87ceeb” SkyBlue).

Now to connect the new material to just that one face, press the Assign button just under the material list.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|The material Assign, Select and Deselect buttons only appear in Edit mode.}}

[[File:Blender267HouseWindowGlassColour.png|thumb]]


{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Patience, Grasshopper.''' A simple blue rectangle may not look very much like glass. But don’t worry: in later lessons, as your skills improve, you will learn how to make a material that looks like ''real'' glass.}}

{{Clear}}

== Adding a Door ==
[[File:Blender268HousePlusDoor.png|300px|right]]
Add the door using the same method: 

Be in Object mode

Deselect all, 

Create a plane, rotating it to face forward as necessary ({{B3D:N2P/Do|R}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|X}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|9KEY}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|0KEY}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}) to align it with the front wall of the house.

Scale the plane down by .7 and then again by .5 along the X axis. 

Move it into position using Front view and then move it against the wall of the house in Side view. 

Change the Object name to “Door”. Create a new material for it; change the material’s name to “Door” and choose an appropriate colour for it.


{{Clr}}

== Building the Fence ==
The fence will consist of long sequences of identical palings. Creating them one by one would be a long, tedious process—which is something the computer, not a human, should do, right? In fact, even creating just ''one'' paling and making duplicate copies would be a long, tedious process. Which is where the magic of modifiers comes in.

Blender’s ''array modifier'' lets you make any number of copies of a single object, all neatly arranged in a row or in various other ways. Being a modifier, the copying only happens at render time, so there is still only a single object to edit while modelling: change that, and the change is automatically propagated to all the copies.

===Make a Paling===
[[image:Blender3d House scale the plane to a fence post.jpg|200px|right]]
Be in object mode, with nothing else selected.

Add a plane, orient it vertically ({{B3D:N2P/Do|R}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|X}} 90 {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}), scaled to 0.4 and then 0.1 along the X axis in Front view. 

{{Clear}}

[[image:Blender3d House fence extrude depth.jpg|200px|right]]
Switch to edit mode. Ensure you are in '''vertex''' select mode ({{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}} -&gt; &quot;vertex&quot;), in case you were still in face-select mode from making the window (above).


To give it some thickness, go into Side view and extrude it to 0.05. 

{{Clear}}

[[image:Blender3d House extrude top of fence post.jpg|200px|right]]
The pointed top is made by going back into Front view, 

Selecting the top vertices and extruding them by -0.07 (along the Z axis is selected automatically), 

{{Clear}}

[[image:Blender3d House scale top of fence post.jpg|200px|right]]
Scaling them to 0 along the X axis and then removing the doubled vertices ({{B3D:N2P/Do|WKEY}}, &quot;Remove Doubles&quot;: it should say &quot;Removed 2 vertices&quot;).

{{Clear}}

In Top view move the paling to the intersection of two grid lines at a suitable distance from the house.

In Front view again, check that the bottom of the paling is level with the bottom of the house.

Change the name of the object and the mesh to &quot;Paling&quot;, create a new material for it called &quot;Paling&quot; and make the colour white.

===Duplicate the Paling===
[[File:Blender267HouseAddingArrayModifier.png|right|300px]]

Be in Front view, as the flat face of the paling is along the X axis and it is easier to create the front fence first.

Change to Object mode. Select the paling. Find the Modifiers Context [[File:Blender255ObjectModifiersContextButton.png]] in the Object Properties window. Click the “Add Modifier” button, and in the menu that pops up, select “Array”. You should see a second copy of the paling appear next to the first.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender267HouseArrayModifier.png|right]]

Look at the checkboxes: “Relative Offset” should be checked, “Constant Offset” and “Object Offset” should ''not'' be checked. Under “Relative Offset”, there are values for X, Y and Z; these are the distances between copies, relative to the dimensions of the object. Change the X value to something like -2 (the negative value causes the duplicated paling to appear on the other side, away from the gap we want to leave in front of the door). Now increase the number under the popup that says “Fixed Count”, and watch the line of duplicates lengthen until it reaches the point that you want to be the corner of the fence line—a count of about 12 did it for me.


{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender267HouseFencePalings2.png|right|300px]]
Now type {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|DKEY}} to make a duplicate of the row of palings, followed by {{B3D:N2P/Do|XKEY}} to constrain its movement to the X-axis (parallel to the row of palings). Move the duplicate row to the end of the existing row so it looks like a continuation of it. Now type {{B3D:N2P/Do|RKEY}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|ZKEY}} -90 {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}} to rotate it so it lies parallel to the side of the house. Increase the array count for this row to something like 24 so it extends all the way past the side of the house to a suitable corner point.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender267HouseFencePalings3.png|right|300px]]
Again, type {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|DKEY}} to duplicate this second row, this time followed by {{B3D:N2P/Do|YKEY}} to constrain its movement parallel to the side of the house. Move the duplicate so its looks like a continuation of the same row. Rotate it parallel to the back of the house by typing {{B3D:N2P/Do|RKEY}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|ZKEY}} -90 {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}. Adjust its array count as necessary to get the right length.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender267HouseFencePalings4.png|right|300px]]
Once more, type {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|DKEY}} to duplicate this third row, followed by {{B3D:N2P/Do|XKEY}} to constrain its movement parallel to the back of the house. Move the duplicate to the end of the row, and rotate it to be parallel to the side of the house with {{B3D:N2P/Do|RKEY}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|ZKEY}} -90 {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}. Give it the same count you did to the array on the other side, so its length will be the same.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender267HouseFencePalings5.png|right|300px]]
One last time: {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|DKEY}} to duplicate, {{B3D:N2P/Do|YKEY}} to ensure it only moves parallel to the side of the house, move to the end of the row, rotate into position with {{B3D:N2P/Do|RKEY}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|ZKEY}} -90 {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}. You’ll probably find it’s so long it runs into the original row of palings you started with on the other side of the front of the house; reduce its array count to something like 8 and you should end up with a nice gap in front of the door.

'''Noob Note:''' I encountered a problem when rendering the fence. It became grainy, and when I say grainy, there are random clusters of black all over every rendered post. Some had few of this 'grain' while others were almost black. I have environment lighting at 1 and it's still goofed up. Would this be due to hand-sizing them instead of putting in all of the above values? I was unable to upload a picture of this to the site, so I used my Dropbox to share the link, [https://www.dropbox.com/s/ml2jbfc6kfmqs01/untitled.png here].

'''Noob Answer:''' I don't think hand sizing would make any difference. The first thing I would do is go back into edit mode on the original paling and select all vertices. Then I would hit 'W' and click remove doubles. After that, recalculate the normals by holding 'Ctrl' and hitting 'N'. Those operations typically fix common rendering issues for me, hopefully it will work for you too.

 '''Alternate Noob Solution:''' I encountered this problem and it turns out it is caused by having more than one copy of the fence in the exact same place. Try moving the affected fence pieces, to find the duplicate then delete it. Remove doubles did not work for my instance of the problem.

{{Clear}}

===Make the Horizontal Bars (Left Side)===

[[File:Blender267HouseFenceHoriz1.png|right|300px]]
The fence needs horizontal bars to hold the palings in place: 
be in Front view

{{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} below the middle of the left-hand fence.

Create a plane, rotating it to the vertical as necessary ({{B3D:N2P/Do|R}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|X}} 90 {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}}) and scale it to the length of the fence. 

Scale it again to 0.05 along the Z axis and move it into position. ( if you keep {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} pressed while you move it, it will snap to the grid.)

Go into Edit mode ({{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}})
 
In Side view move it so it is against the back of the fence and extrude it by -0.04 along the Y axis. 

Go into Object mode ({{B3D:N2P/Do|TAB}}). Give the horizontal bar the same material you previously created for the palings.

Duplicate it ({{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|DKEY}}) and move it (keeping {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL}} pressed) along the Z axis ({{B3D:N2P/Do|ZKEY}}) to make the bottom bar.

{{Clear}}

===Make the Horizontal Bars (Right Side)===
[[File:Blender267HouseFenceHoriz2.png|right|300px]]
To make the bars on the right-hand part of the fence:
In Front view, select ''both'' the horizontal bars you just created: {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on one, then {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|RMB}} on the other (you may need to zoom in to be able to select them without accidentally including the rest of the fence). Duplicate them with {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|DKEY}}. Move your duplicates along the X-axis {{B3D:N2P/Do|XKEY}} until they are horizontally centred around middle of the right-hand fence; now scale them horizontally {{B3D:N2P/Do|SKEY}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|XKEY}} until they are the right size.

You could have done the bars one by one, but it’s quicker to do them both at once, don’t you think?

{{Clear}}

===Put the Horizontal Bars Around The House===

Select the two horizontal bars you created above for the front fence (make sure you don’t select anything else, like the palings). Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|DKEY}} to make a duplicate, then {{B3D:N2P/Do|R}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} to rotate the duplicate about the Z-axis, type 90 for the angle and press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}} to confirm the rotation. In the top view, move the duplicate ({{B3D:N2P/Do|G}}) you just made so it’s against the side fence. Keep scaling it along the Y-axis ({{B3D:N2P/Do|S}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|Y}}) and/or moving it along the Y-axis ({{B3D:N2P/Do|G}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|Y}}) until it’s the right length and position.

Having done the side of the house, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT}}+{{B3D:N2P/Do|DKEY}} to make another duplicate of the horizontal bars, and {{B3D:N2P/Do|R}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} 90 {{B3D:N2P/Do|ENTER}} to rotate it into the right alignment for the back fence. In the top view, move ({{B3D:N2P/Do|G}}) it against the palings. Now keep scaling and moving it along the X-axis until it has the right length and position.

Having done the back of the house, do the other side: another duplicate of the bars, rotate 90° around the Z-axis, move against the palings, move and scale until they’re the proper length in the right position.

Again, another duplicate, rotate and move/scale into position against the palings on the other side of the front of the house.

[[Image:fence-complete.png|right|400px]]

Your house should now look like this.

{{Clear}}

== The Ground Plane and a Path ==
[[Image:house-complete.png|right|400px]]

===Make the Ground===
In Top view put the 3D cursor somewhere near the middle of the plot, (click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}) 

Create a plane

Be in camera view (bottom right-hand window) 

Scale it to extend just past the boundaries of what the camera sees (10.0 seems a good number). 

Go back into Object mode and change its (object, mesh) name to &quot;Ground&quot;,

create a new material for it, rename it &quot;Grass&quot; and select a suitable green from the colour selector (&quot;00cd00&quot; green3). 

Check in Front view that it is level with the bottom of the house and fence and move it (along the Z axis) if necessary.

===Make the Path===
[[File:Blender267HousePath1.png|300px|right]]
For the path: Go into Top view, create a plane.

Scale it to fit the gap in the front fence with some space on either side and position it just outside the fence.  

Check, in Front view, that it lines up with the door and is level with the bottom of the house. 

Scale it along the X axis to the same width as the door.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender267HousePath2.png|300px|right]]
Be in Top view, Select the two vertices closest to the fence, and extrude {{B3D:N2P/Do|E}} away from the house {{B3D:N2P/Do|Y}} to make a suitable width for the footpath outside the fence.

{{Clear}}
[[File:Blender267HousePath4.png|300px|right]]
Of those four vertices just outside the fence, select the left two and extrude a suitable distance to the left, and then the right two and extrude a suitable distance to the right, to make the path passing the house.

{{Clear}}
===Give the Path Some Thickness===
The path is still just a flat plane. Let’s give it some thickness, so it rises slightly above the ground.

Go to Object mode. Make sure the path is still selected. Go to the Modifiers Context [[File:Blender255ObjectModifiersContextButton.png]], click Add Modifiers, and look for Solidify. The default thickness (the top-left editable field) is 0.01; change this to -0.01 so the path protrudes above the ground rather than into it.

==Improve the Lighting==
[[File:Blender267HouseLighting.png|300px|right]]
If you were to try to render now, you will probably find that most of your beautiful house is lost in gloomy shadow. To fix this, let’s add a bit more light to the scene.

In the top view, find the existing default Lamp object. Duplicate it a couple of times, and position your copies around the house to give it a more even lighting.

{{Clear}}
==Check the Camera View==
[[File:Blender267HouseCameraView.png|300px|right]]
Before doing the render, check your camera is properly positioned to capture the beauty of your work. In the camera view (top-right quadrant of the split view), you should see something like this; note the ''passepartout'' (darkened area) outside the rectangle denoting the visible area of the scene that will be rendered. If you {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on the rectangle, you can reposition the camera from side to side or up and down with {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}}, or do {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}  {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}} to move it closer to or further away from the scene.

{{Clear}}
==Final Render==
Now hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}}, and hopefully you should see something like this!

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
a medium onion

==Equipment==
* [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|pan]]
* [[Cookbook:Fork|fork]] 
* [[Cookbook:Chef's Knife|chopper]]
* [[Cookbook:Cutting Board|chopping board]]
* [[Cookbook:Mixing Bowl|bowl]]

==Procedure==
# Take one eggplant or more roast it in a old pan with oil. It is advisable that the pan would have ribs so that eggplant won't be cooking in its own juices.
# During the roasting, make holes in the eggplant with a fork, the steam accumulates in it and needs to get out. 
# After the eggplant is absolutely soft and most of its peel is blackened, put the eggplant on a board and cut it lengthwise. Keep the flesh of the eggplant and remove all the burned skin. 
# [[Cookbook:Mincing|Mince]] the eggplant with a knife to a [[Cookbook:Purée|purée]], keeping the seeds whole. The cutting should be done with a stainless steel chopper or wooden chopper. (In my opinion it is best to use a stainless steel chopper).
# Pass the roasted eggplant into a glass or plastic bowl and add between half a spoon to one full spoon of oil for every eggplant, and salt according to ones own taste. Then chop the onion in small pieces and add it in the eggplant salad. 
# Store in the refrigerator until serving time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Benzene''' is an ''aromatic'' hydrocarbon or ''arene''.

== Structure ==
The usual structural representation for benzene is a six carbon ring (represented by a hexagon) which includes three double bonds. Each of the carbons represented by a corner is also bonded to one other atom. In benzene itself, these atoms are hydrogens. The double bonds are separated by single bonds so we recognize the arrangement as involving conjugated double bonds. An alternative symbol uses a circle inside the hexagon to represent the six pi electrons.

[[Image:Benzene-aromaticity-3D-balls.png|300px]]

Instead of having three short double bonds and three long single bonds (above, left), it has six medium-length bonds (above, right).

A double bond is really two bonds, with two electrons in each bond, so four electrons in total in a double bond.  Two electrons from each double bond in benzene (if the double bonds really existed, which they don't) are smeared over all six carbon atoms.

Whenever electrons are not confined to a bond between just two atoms, they are called ''declocalised electrons''.

Image:Benzene-3D-potential.png|&lt;center&gt;This electrostatic potential surface shows greater electron density inside the ring&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Benzene-HOMO-4-3D-balls.png|&lt;center&gt;The π electrons in benzene occupy molecular orbitals like this one, which are delocalised over the entire molecule&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Bold Keywords===

I suggest quoting all keywords/reserved words in code segment with &lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;(three single quotations), so that they are easy to be seen.
For example:
 '''int''' foo;
 '''return''' 0;
etc...

- [[User:Ronyclau|Ron Lau]] 18:07, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

:I see not problem with that, but that shouldn't be enforced (an obligation to editors), so does it need to be adopted at a convention and we should consider the future (as that will take some time to be maintained), have you taken a look on the Ada book or the Java, they use other solutions I was thinking on implementing the Ada approach since the Java book seems very complex, there is also a possibility that Wikibooks can in a near future do some treatment to code, like colorization of keywords, comments etc... (check the staff lounge discussion for something on those lines, it has been discussed there).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:52, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

=== Removal of TOC2 print version ===
Since TOC2 is never was a reflection of the C++ Programming book but an alternative presentation of of the book content and it is very out of date with the real content, it never gets updated. As with the previous navigation templated navigation scheme that existed I propose that we remove this most probably unused feature and check as a way to check if anyone object to the idea and what function it serves at the moment...
'''Proposed:''' --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:13, 6 March 2008 (UTC)

:I reformulate the proposal as it doesn't make sense to keep in the convention a very specific rule as this one, since I reformulate to &lt;'''The book will only have a single print version, that may include by chapter subsections.'''&gt; this can be applied in a more general sense (and across other books that share the conventions).
:'''Proposed:'''--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:05, 10 April 2008 (UTC)

=== Removal of TOC2 completely ===
As no objection nor work was done to fix and address the previous proposal I extend the same rational to the removal of TOC2 from the work, lack of maintenance, breaks the work flow and really serves no real propose but creates several difficulties.
I can't provide metrics (they are down) but last time I saw numbers, the access to the book most people do use was TOC1 and TOC2 existence creates the need to maintain several extra pages:
[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/C%2B%2B_Programming/STL/string 1],[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/C%2B%2B_Programming/STL/iostream 2],[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/C%2B%2B_Programming/Design_Patterns_Introduction 3], [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/C%2B%2B_Programming/Keywords 4], [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/C%2B%2B_Programming/Functions 5] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/C%2B%2B_Programming/Flow_Control 6] (many more would be made redundant)  Proposed:--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:01, 13 March 2008 (UTC)

:The same problem as the proposal above. I do reformulate the proposal to read &lt;'''Cover page will display the historical book index and any significative change (&gt;51%) to the cover page will be have to be the object of previous discussion resulting in acceptance without objections'''&gt;, this is more or less the rule of tumb on edits but will put the cover page outside of the bebold rule, reducing not only chance of conflicts or in sporadic edits/changes to book structure, permitting a solid and agreed upon evolution of the work. Again this will be used across books.
:'''Proposed''':  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:19, 10 April 2008 (UTC)

::By historical book index do you mean TOC1, so [[C%2B%2B_Programming/TOC1]] will be moved to [[C%2B%2B_Programming]]? [[User:Ikarsik|rawrawrer]] ([[User talk:Ikarsik|talk]]) 20:57, 18 April 2008 (UTC)

:::Yes, this also doesn't affect selecting and using a cover or doing any major (consensual) changes to the main toc...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:34, 18 April 2008 (UTC)
:::This can also be confusing, but it doesn't collide with '''One book with many faces''' that means that new ways of accessing the content or changing the layout can be created, but respecting the original structure and content (to what I gave the name '''historical book index''' or the main trunk of the book...), solving also the need for multiple print versions in the future. One could argue for several print version by chapter but the main version can be trimmed down as one print is (by selecting the needed pages).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:39, 18 April 2008 (UTC)

:::Ok I finally contacted Darklama about the TOC2 page as I thought it should be done, the user didn't challenge the decission even if he seems to be unaware of the discussion the issue has been given ([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Darklama&amp;oldid=1233053#TOCs my post and his reply]). I will proceed and request the restoration of the cover pages and history files in a few days.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:55, 19 July 2008 (UTC)

:::I will also archive any discussion related to the TOCs but not the the TOCs content (since that is as separated issue and is seems to be still needing resolution) with this discussion (even from pages that normally aren't archived like the main talk page of the book). We should probably put a notice there about that...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:06, 19 July 2008 (UTC)

::::Based on [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Darklama&amp;oldid=1233053#TOCs the link you provided] I think it's pretty clear that darklama disagrees with your decision. He also seems to think that no consensus has been reached, and from what I've been seeing, I might have to agree. Having two TOCs is not necessarily a bad thing, and a rush to delete one outright is not a smart thing for people to be doing right now. ''If'' it is important that this book have only one TOC, I suggest merging the two and taking the best ideas from each. Until I see evidence of ''multilateral consensus'' on this issue, I'm not going to delete, move, or unprotect anything. Of course, I cannot speak for all admins. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:15, 22 July 2008 (UTC)

:::::I read it another way, but if you think rehashing the problem is a positive move, it is your prerogative. Darklama clearly states that he doesn't care, the &quot;page&quot; in question was last edited in 2007, it doesn't index half of the book and I think it still provides links to duplicated content (some was already salvageable or moved to a new book with a narrower scope, but several pages still need cleanup), in any case the proposal was made and not objected. What Darklama seems to object is the lack of participation on the discussion, not much can be made to force participation in an issue that mostly deals only with 2 users opinions.
:::::If you observe the two pages toc2 is subgrup of toc1 that already links and reflects the content, a merge would not generate any change, the only big difference is in the order, and toc1 isn't locked, people were always able to edit it. 
:::::In any case if you think that the issue needs to be more loudly stated the only recourse would be a VfD, if you don't see the previous discussion as valid (what would be hard to justify, as it always served its purpose). The only point I have against it is that we will bring people that are outside of the problem (non editors) into a discussion that does only have an impact on the book organization (content and organization are not factor at the moment).
:::::I find it strange that you also raise the issue of ''multilateral consensus'' since the action that created the problem did not have a similar approach and resolution.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:48, 22 July 2008 (UTC)

(*reset*)&lt;br&gt;
A [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion&amp;oldid=1242257 VFD on the TOC2 page was initiated (27 July 2008) and then closed (30 July 2008) by Mike.lifeguard], if Wikibookians wish to express concerns about the speedy action they can use this page, I will contact James and ~VNinja~ to restate their points (or move that part of the discussion here).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:04, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

Whiteknight as seen on the previous comment disagrees with my interpretation that darklama didn't object to the decission, and so refused to execute the speedy deletion.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:15, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

darklama didn't participate on the discussion that was initiated in 13 March 2008 and ended in 18 April 2008 + 7 days by default with no stated objection (as seen above) and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Darklama&amp;oldid=1233053#TOCs clearly stated no wish or care on the outcome] when I took upon myself to verify if he was aware of it (my post above in 19 July 2008). (not the proceedings, he does indeed rant on how it was reached but historical it was always done in that way and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Conventions&amp;oldid=599420#new_presentation he even participated in several, and implemented similar decisions], so the argument raised by Whiteknight is moot),  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:15, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

The reasons for the proposal are simple the page is [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming/TOC2&amp;action=history stale since 7 October 2007] it only indexes less than 50% of the work and has very little use ([http://wikistics.falsikon.de/latest/wikibooks/en/ considering the metrics available]) C++ Programming is one of the most used works on the project and the situation the page created reduces its use less than 1/3 of the hits of the title page and the other and previously main toc, its continued existence undermines improvement and efforts in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AC%2B%2B_Programming&amp;diff=1221459&amp;oldid=1220798 promotion of the book].  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:41, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

I was hoping James would clarify the position he took on the VFD in any case I would be the first to support an undeletion of the page, if James provides a rational for keeping it.
I'm re-closing the proposal (9 days since it was re-addressed), it was approved without objections. Will move it into the approved conventions in a few hours.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:02, 8 August 2008 (UTC)&lt;br&gt;
I'll live the convention with the previous adoption date (since it wasn't removed nor a discussion addressed the approval of the same). I'll re-tag the page and put a request in the administration forum for the rest.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:11, 10 August 2008 (UTC)

The deletion request for the page was removed again ([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APanic2k4&amp;diff=1239262&amp;oldid=1239141 I supported the first re-addressing of the issue to clear the issue raised by WK]) by user [[User:Mike.lifeguard]] and this time  [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMike.lifeguard&amp;diff=1249815&amp;oldid=1249709#Why I strongly objected to that action -'''why'''-], the position of Darklama had already been confirmed and except for the new objection of James (that failed address the issue and consequently failed to be materialize by a restatement or a reply to my own post in the closed VFD).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:29, 12 August 2008 (UTC)

=== Language proposal ===
Since United States English is dominant on this work, for consistency's sake, it should be used whenever possible.
I propose this to be made into a convention '''Proposed''':  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:20, 31 July 2008 (UTC)

Closing the proposal as approved without objections. Will move it into the approved conventions in a few hours.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:57, 8 August 2008 (UTC)&lt;br&gt;

== Prefer hyphenation ==
I propose that hyphenation should be preferred (as in used if possible) on the book. Basically hyphens are meant to aid comprehension and defining this convention would provide standardization to the content.&lt;br&gt;
Did a search on google also &quot;convention of hyphen of words technical&quot;: [http://books.google.pt/books?id=8n-GDx3cGHMC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=convention+of+hyphen+of+words+technical&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0gzEdCuAAM&amp;sig=Szx1W4pMfaiLdEEAhd_g0ZH7wQo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=d6N_SqyfBqbKjAfC_ujwAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false this one resumes my views on the issue], I also have been examining the C++ Standard and made a quick review on some of my favorite technical books and  this seems to be a common practice on more technical books (the use of the hyphen). I understand that goes some what against a previous convention as (From Wikipedia:) ''British English tends towards hyphenation (pre-school) whereas American English tends towards omission of the hyphen (preschool)''. ([[w:English compound]], [[w:Hyphen]] ).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:11, 21 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Scala|A Pragmatic Programming Language}}

Scala is a general-purpose language designed to support clear, concise and type-safe programming as well as to scale from the smallest applications to the biggest. It does so by providing a sophisticated type system, a concise and flexible syntax supporting internal DSLs, and an integration of the functional and object-oriented paradigm together with many powerful abstractions. Furthermore, Scala is compatible with Java, and existing Java libraries can be called from Scala and vice versa. The consequences of this design are many:

* The number of lines required for the same code is often much smaller in Scala than for other general-purpose languages such as C, C++, C# and Java, typically ranging from 2-3x to 10x. This is done while still having performance comparable to Java.
* Many common tasks that normally require either verbose syntax, built-in syntax or external DSLs such as actors, linear algebra, numerical computing, testing, parsing, etc. can instead be provided as libraries in Scala with concise syntax. Examples include the actor libraries such as [http://akka.io/ Akka]; numerical programming, linear algebra and more such as [https://github.com/dlwh/breeze Breeze]; testing such as [http://www.scalatest.org/ ScalaTest] or [http://etorreborre.github.com/specs2/ specs2]; or parsing such as the parser combinator libraries.
* Performance, safety and productivity are 3 areas that are difficult to obtain in one programming language. Scala provides all three to a high degree. Scala has the productivity commonly associated with scripting languages, while having performance comparable with Java. The static and sophisticated type system, the powerful abstractions and the support for referential transparency and immutability help increase the safety, clarity and reliability of programs written in Scala.
* Considerable support for parallel and concurrent programming. Examples include actor libraries, immutable collections, parallel collections and STM (see Akka).
* A gradual shift from Java to Scala is supported. Scala can be introduced step by step, for instance by writing new test modules in Scala.

As of 2012-07-05, the current implementation of the language is actively being developed for the Java Virtual Machine, and there are efforts underway to support the .NET framework.

Due to the depth of the language, the many powerful abstractions, and the sophisticated type system, Scala is sometimes seen as a language that is difficult to learn. While parts of Scala are definitely challenging for most programmers, the knowledge and skills required to be effective in Scala is much easier to attain. This book divides the different topics into layers of knowledge that are required for doing different things in Scala. The layers are not always indicative of difficulty. For instance, higher-order functions are seen by some to be difficult, but because they are extremely useful, they are described in the Basic part of the book.

If you are a Java programmer, there exists several guides, resources and books that are directly focused on Java programmers. See http://www.scala-lang.org/node/1305#Java for more information.

== Overview ==
The book is split up into several parts: Basics, Intermediate and Advanced.

&quot;Basics&quot; describes how to setup Scala, and introduces basic syntax, expressions, functions, basic object-oriented programming, and basic functional programming. It also introduces List, case classes and pattern matching. The articles in Basic contains sufficient knowledge to write simple programs in Scala.

&quot;Intermediate&quot; expands upon the knowledge in Basics. This includes advanced functional and object-oriented programming, type-safe programming and an introduction to the collections library. The knowledge in Intermediate should be sufficient for using Scala effectively for many applications.

&quot;Advanced&quot; describes features that are useful for writing libraries, such as higher-kinded types and implicits.

The book should have short, motivating and easy to understand articles on the different subjects. The articles should not spend too much time explaining why features are the way they are, or describing every last detail. The reason is that the book is meant to be a learning resource, and covering every last detail that is not very important may hinder learning and waste the readers time. For readers that desire more comprehensive coverage and documentation, there exists several resources such as http://docs.scala-lang.org/, Programming Scala from O'Reilly, and Programming in Scala from Artima.

==Surgery vs. RT==
*'''Milan, 1997''' (1986-91) PMID 9284774 — &quot;Randomised study of radical surgery versus radiotherapy for stage Ib-IIa cervical cancer.&quot; Landoni F et al. Lancet. 1997 Aug 23;350(9077):535-40.
**Randomized. 343 patients. Stage IB-IIA (Ib1 61%, Ib2 27%, IIA 12%) Treated with radical hysterectomy (Class III) vs. radical RT. Median F/U 87 mo. 
**RT given: EBRT to median 47 Gy followed by LDR x1 for Point A median dose 76 Gy. Adjuvant RT allowed for pts who were surgical stage IIB or greater, &lt;3mm of safe cervical stroma, positive margins, or positive LN (62/114 IB1, 46/55 IB2).
**63% of pts in surgery arm received RT.  
**5-year outcome: no difference; Non-bulky: OS surgery 87% vs. RT 90% (NS), DFS surgery 80% vs. 82% (NS)
**AdenoCA: significantly better outcomes with surgery; OS (70% vs. 59%), DFS (66% vs. 47%)
**Complications (Grade 2-3): Surgery 28% vs RT 12% (SS). Severe leg edema surgery 0%, RT 1%, surgery + RT 9%
**Conclusion: Primary surgery not a good option for bulky disease

==Surgery +/- Post-op RT==
25% of Stage IB pts may benefit from XRT because they have positive risk factors (from [[Radiation_Oncology/Cervix/Overview#Surgical_staging|GOG 49]]). '''Sedlis criteria''' often simplified to needing 2 or more of these factors:
* CLS (LVI) involvement
*deep stromal invasion (middle or deep third); [i.e &gt;1/3 stromal invasion]
*Size &gt; 4 cm


*'''GOG 92''' (1988-95)
**277 pts. Randomized. Stage IB, node negative, but with high estimated risk of recurrence (from GOG 49) s/p radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy randomized to +/- adjuvant pelvic XRT 50.4 Gy. Included pts with: 1) CLS involved, deep 1/3 stromal invasion, any size; 2) CLS involved, middle 1/3 invasion, size &gt;= 2cm; 3) CLS involved, superficial 1/3 invasion, &gt;= 5 cm; or 4) CLS not involved, deep or middle 1/3 invasion, &gt;= 4 cm. These pts were estimated to have a 31% recurrence at 3 yrs.
**'''1999''' PMID 10329031 &amp;mdash; &quot;A randomized trial of pelvic radiation therapy versus no further therapy in selected patients with stage IB carcinoma of the cervix after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy: A Gynecologic Oncology Group Study.&quot; Sedlis A et al. Gynecol Oncol. 1999 May;73(2):177-83.
***Recurrences in 15% (RT) vs 28% (no RT). 2-year recurrence free rate 88% vs 79%. Hazard ratio=0.53. Grade 3/4 adverse effects were 6% vs 2.1% Distant mets 2% (RT) vs 7% (no RT).  Follow up too short for survival analysis.
**'''2006''' PMID 16427212 &amp;mdash; &quot;A phase III randomized trial of postoperative pelvic irradiation in Stage IB cervical carcinoma with poor prognostic features: follow-up of a gynecologic oncology group study.&quot; Rotman M et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 May 1;65(1):169-76. 
***Decreased rate of recurrence by 46%; local recurrence 13.9% (RT) vs 20.7% (no RT), distant 2.9% vs 8.6%. Improved PFS by 42%. Decreased death rate by 30% (28.6% vs 19.7%) but not S.S. (p=0.07). RT has improved benefit for adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous histologies (8.8% vs 44% recurrence).

==Surgery + Post-op RT vs. Post-op CRT==
'''High risk features:'''
*microscopic involvement of the parametrium (upstaged to IIB)
*positive pelvic lymph nodes (upstaged to IIIB)
*positive surgical margins


*'''GOG 109 / Intergroup 0107 / SWOG 8797 / RTOG 9112''' (1991-96) -- RT vs chemo+RT
**Randomized, 268 patients.  Post-operative clinical stage IA2, IB, and IIA, s/p radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, with ''high risk features'' (positive pelvic lymph nodes, positive margins, or microscopic involvement of the parametrium). Randomized to RT vs RT+CT.  Chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin 70 mg/m^2 and a 96-hour infusion of fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m^2/d every 3 weeks x four cycles (1st and 2nd cycles concurrent with RT). RT 49.3 Gy in 29 fractions (1.7 Gy/fx). 45 Gy (1.5 Gy/fx) given to paraaortic area if positive common iliac LN.
**'''2000''' - PMID 10764420 &amp;mdash; &quot;Concurrent chemotherapy and pelvic radiation therapy compared with pelvic radiation therapy alone as adjuvant therapy after radical surgery in high-risk early-stage cancer of the cervix.&quot; (Peters WA 3rd et al. J Clin Oncol. 2000 Apr;18(8):1606-13.)
***4-year OS 71% (RT) vs 81% (RT+CT), HR=2.01; 4-year PFS 63% vs 80%, HR=1.96
***Conclusion: Addition of cisplatin based chemotherapy to RT significantly improves progression free survival and overall survival following surgery for high-risk, early stage patients
**'''2005''' PMID 15721417 &amp;mdash; &quot;Rethinking the use of radiation and chemotherapy after radical hysterectomy: a clinical-pathologic analysis of a Gynecologic Oncology Group/Southwest Oncology Group/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial.&quot; Monk BJ et al. Gynecol Oncol. 2005 Mar;96(3):721-8.
***Smaller benefit for chemo+RT when only 1 LN is positive.
**'''Carbonic Anhydrase-IX; 2010''' PMID 19913895 -- &quot;Prognostic relevance of carbonic anhydrase-IX in high-risk, early-stage cervical cancer: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.&quot; (Liao SY, Gynecol Oncol. 2010 Mar;116(3):452-8. Epub 2009 Nov 13.)
***Retrospective. 166 patients, stained for CA-IX expression (high &gt;80% staining). 
***Outcome: High CA-IX in 21%, associated with tumor size and depth of invasion. On MVA, independent prognostic factor for PFS (HR 2.1, SS), and OS (HR 2.4, SS)
***Conclusion: Tumor hypoxia measured by CA-IX independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS

==Primary RT vs. Pre-op RT + Surgery==
*'''GOG 71 / RTOG 84-12''' (1984-91)
**Randomized. 256 pts. &quot;Suboptimal&quot; or &quot;bulky&quot; stage IB, defined as: exophytic tumor &gt;= 4 cm, a cervix expanded to &gt;= 4 cm (and assumed to be tumor by the clinician), large or barrel-shaped tumors of &gt;= 4 cm
***Randomized to: RT alone vs RT followed by hysterectomy
***EBRT to 40 Gy (RT alone) or 45 Gy (adjuvant hysterectomy). Followed in 1-2 weeks by brachy to 40 Gy (RT alone) or 30 Gy (hyst), for a total of 80 Gy vs 75 Gy to point A. Group 2 had extrafascial hysterectomy 2-6 wks after completing RT. 
**'''2003''' PMID 12798694 &amp;mdash; &quot;Radiation therapy with and without extrafascial hysterectomy for bulky stage IB cervical carcinoma: a randomized trial of the Gynecologic Oncology Group.&quot; Keys HM et al. Gynecol Oncol. 2003 Jun;89(3):343-53. 
***Median f/u 9.6 yrs. Lower incidence of local relapse with addition of hysterectomy (27% vs 14%). No difference in OS. Trend toward 5 year PFS 53% (RT) vs 62% (RT + surgery) (p=0.09). Disease progression in 46% (RT) vs 37% (RT + surgery) p=0.07. No difference in severe toxicity. Patients with 4-6 cm tumors may benefit from hysterectomy.

==Pre-op RT vs. Pre-op CRT==
*'''GOG 123''' (1992-97)
**Randomized. 369 pts. Stage IB (at least 4 cm).
***Randomized to: RT -&gt; hysterectomy vs RT/chemo -&gt; hysterectomy
***45 Gy EBRT followed by brachytherapy to total dose 75 Gy to point A. Cisplatin weekly at 40 mg/m2, maximum of 6 doses. Extrafascial hysterectomy 3-6 after RT. 
**'''1999''' PMID 10202166 &amp;mdash; &quot;Cisplatin, radiation, and adjuvant hysterectomy compared with radiation and adjuvant hysterectomy for bulky stage IB cervical carcinoma.&quot; Keys HM et al. N Engl J Med. 1999 Apr 15;340(15):1154-61. 
***Median f/u 36 mos. 3-yr OS 74% vs 83% (RT+chemo). RR=0.54. Recurrence rate 37% vs 21%, RR=0.51. 
***Conclusion: concomitant chemotherapy given with RT prior to hysterectomy improves survival.
***Comment: authors felt that improved LC led to improved OS due to addition of cisplatin, and that adding hysterectomy did not impact OS
**'''2007''' PMID 17980189 -- &quot;Radiation therapy with or without weekly cisplatin for bulky stage 1B cervical carcinoma: follow-up of a Gynecologic Oncology Group trial.&quot; (Stehman FB, Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2007 Nov;197(5):503.e1-6.)
***Median f/u 101 months (8.3 yr). Relative risk of progression 0.61; hazard ratio for death 0.63. 6-yr DFS 71% vs 60%; OS 78% vs 64%. Increased early hematologic and GI toxicity seen with RT+chemo. No difference in late effects.
***Concurrent cisplatin improves long-term PFS and OS. Serious late effects were not increased. The inclusion of hysterectomy has been discontinued on the basis of another trial.

==Surgery +/- Neoadjuvant chemotherapy==
*'''GOG 141''' 
**''Study was closed prematurely due to slow accrual.'' Randomized. 288 patients with Stage IB2. Treated with exlap with radical hysterectomy and PPaLND +/- neoadjuvant vincristine-cisplatin x3 cycles 
**'''2007''' PMID 17493669 -- &quot;Treatment of (&quot;bulky&quot;) stage IB cervical cancer with or without neoadjuvant vincristine and cisplatin prior to radical hysterectomy and pelvic/para-aortic lymphadenectomy: a phase III trial of the gynecologic oncology group.&quot; (Eddy GL, Gynecol Oncol. 2007 Aug;106(2):362-9. Epub 2007 May 9.). Median F/U 5.2 years
***Outcome: Comparable recurrence rate and death rate; post-op RT necessary in 52% vs. 45% (NS)
***Conclusion: No benefit for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in IB2 prior to surgery; majority needed further radiation


==(Surgery-RT or Primary RT) +/- Neoadjuvant chemotherapy==
*'''Argentina''' (1987-1992) 
**Randomized. 210 patients with IB (~50% bulky). Arm 1) Surgery + adjuvant pelvic RT 50 gy or if unresectable surgical staging + primary pelvic RT 60 Gy + LDR boost 25-35 Gy vs. Arm 2) Neoadjuvant chemo ([[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations|VBP]]) with same treatment
**'''1997''' PMID 9345358 -- &quot;Long-term follow-up of the first randomized trial using neoadjuvant chemotherapy in stage Ib squamous carcinoma of the cervix: the final results.&quot; (Sardi JE, Gynecol Oncol. 1997 Oct;67(1):61-9.) Median F/U 5.6 years
***Outcome: No difference in Ib1 (nonbulky). Benefit in IB2 (bulky) OS neoajduvant 80% vs. control 61% (SS)(due to increased operability 100% vs. 85%, SS).
***Resectability: 7-year OS resectable 69% vs. unresectable 14% (SS)
***Conclusion: Neoadjuvant chemo can improve OS because of improved resectability in Ib2 (bulky) patients

==PA Nodes==
*'''Gustave Roussy; 2008''' (2004-2006) PMID 18487573 -- &quot;Histologic results of para-aortic lymphadenectomy in patients treated for stage IB2/II cervical cancer with negative [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans in the para-aortic area.&quot; (Boughanim M, J Clin Oncol. 2008 May 20;26(15):2558-61.)
**Retrospective. 38 patients with cervix IB2/II with negative PET in PA LNs. Treated with Chemo-RT (cisplatin 40 mg/m2/wk + EBRT 45/25) + LDR BT &gt;=15 Gy. Then PALND
**Outcome: 3/38 (8%) had pathologically positive PA LN
**Conclusion: 8% of patients with negative PA by PET have disease after chemo-RT therapy

[[Image:OpenOffice.org Base.png|thumb|right|OOo Base]]
OpenOffice.org Base, is a relational database management system, a competitor to Microsoft Access and even suitable for beginners to databases. Much documentation and books for Microsoft Access will apply similarly (but not necessarily identically) for OpenOffice.org Base. It is a member of the OpenOffice.org suite of applications. OpenOffice.org users can choose to connect to external full-featured SQL database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and even Oracle through ODBC or JDBC drivers. OpenOffice.org Base can hence act as a GUI frontend for SQL views, table design and query. In addition, OpenOffice.org has its own Form wizard to create dialog windows for form filling and updates.

Base may not be included with your operating system, but you should be able to get it relatively easily, as it is [[w:free software|free software]]. You will also need Java installed (and not disabled in OpenOffice.org) in order for Base to run.

==Data==

A database is a structured collection of records or data that is stored in a computer system. The structure is achieved by organizing the data according to a database model. The model in most common use today is the relational model.

A database management system (DBMS) is computer software that manages databases. DBMSes may use any of a variety of database models, such as the network model or relational model. In large systems, a DBMS allows users and other software to store and retrieve data in a structured way.
==Connecting to Databases==
If you have an existing database already created, you can connect to it either with the first screen you see in OpenOffice.org Base or by clicking ''File'', ''New'', ''Database'' then ''Connect to existing Database''. There is limited support for ''Microsoft Access'' databases.
==Relations==

Imagine you want to record the products that customers order from your company. You could use a spreadsheet with one customer per row, but one customer might order many products. You could use a spreadsheet with one order per row, but you may have to type in customer name and address repetitively for many orders. In situations such as this, you are better off using a database rather than a spreadsheet.

The difference between databases and spreadsheets is that while spreadsheets can contain records (often a row in a spreadsheet) and data fields (which is just a particular type of data - often a column header in a spreadsheet), databases can also contain relationships between records. These can be '''one-to-many''' relationships or '''many-to-many''' relationships.

When you specify the relationships between tables you can also specify '''referential integrity''' so that data can't be entered which contradicts related data in another table.

==Wizards==
''Wizards'' are simply a way of describing a step-by-step approach in making software easier for the user, usually choosing an option and clicking ''Next''.
On launching Base you are presented with a ''Database Wizard'' which offers you the choice of creating a database, opening or connecting to an existing one. Choose ''Create a Database'' to begin with and click ''Next''. Choose to ''register the database'', don't worry this is only done locally and can help other modules of OpenOffice.org (such as Calc) work with your database. Don't choose the Table wizard just yet and save (and name) your database in a convenient location. For now, use OpenDocument Database format, though this will probably be already automatically selected as the default. Why save it already? Because data such as records will be saved automatically as it is being entered into a database.

Databases do not use files in the normal sense, however a good database can output its content structured with SQL (Structured Query Language) - an ANSI/ISO standard. It is also important that it supports ODBC (Open Data Base Connectivity)

You should now be presented with the main interface. On the left is the Database column which contains four options (sometimes called '''modules'''); Tables, Queries, Forms and Reports.

==Tables==
A table will be the closest aspect of database to resemble an ordinary spreadsheet.
Click on tables (it may already be selected) and you will be presented with a choice of Tasks (in the upper part); ''Create Table in Design View'', ''Use Wizard to Create Table'' and ''Create View...''. Choose ''Use Wizard to Create Table''. There are four steps ''Select fields'', ''Set types and formats'', ''Set primary key'' and ''Create table''. Choose a category ''Business'' or ''Personal'' then choose a ''Sample table'' then click the double arrows &gt;&gt; which will copy all the fields into ''Selected fields'' on the right. Click next and you can adjust the field characteristics. Click next and make sure ''Create a primary key'' is checked and ''Automatically add a primary key''. Click next and the table name should read whatever ''Sample table'' you chose. Ensure ''Insert data immediately'' is checked and click ''Finish''. Congratulations, you have created your first table. You should now be able to see it looks rather like a spreadsheet. There is not yet any data in it, it is usually better to add data using Forms so close it for now. You will notice that although you have not yet clicked to save it, the table has now automatically been saved. You can see it when you return to the main window and even if you close and reopen the database.
===Design View===
''Creating a table in design view'' is a more specific way of creating a table. Click on it and you will see a spreadsheet-like layout but this might be deceptive (don't confuse it with the table view). The left column is for the ''Field name'' which you choose (you can choose anything, this will be for your reference). The second column is for ''Field Type'' and contains a drop-down menu for the type of data that will be stored in this field. For example a name would be ''Text [VARCHAR]'', a date would be ''Date [DATE]'' and so on. When the ''Field type'' is selected, you will see a window at the bottom which is the ''Field Properties'' where can you specify things like whether you require data to be entered into that field type when logging records, the permitted character length of the data and decimal places. You can specify '''validation''' here which checks that data entered is among the permitted data. Unlike in the Table wizard you will need to save any changes in Design view that you want to keep, before closing it to return to the main window.

==Forms==
Forms are used to enter data easily and quickly. Click on ''Forms'' on the left hand side of the screen (in ''Database'' column) and ''Use Wizard to Create Form...'' (Writer may briefly pop up but also the ''Form Wizard'' should be on top). Click on the double arrow &gt;&gt; to add all fields to the right hand column called ''Fields in the form'', and then, (unless you want to change the layout and colors) just click ''Finish''. To build a query for the data, first close the ''Form'' in the ''Writer'' window.

'''Controls''' are aspects of forms to configure each fields particular properties. The form is edited in a Writer window and the Form controls are accessed in the same way as in Writer, ''View'', ''Toolbars'' then ''Form Controls''.

Basic switchboards (as in Microsoft Access) can only be created in OpenOffice.org using Forms.

==Queries==
Queries are a way of querying your data according to certain conditions or criteria. Complex calculations can be performed with queries.

Note: There are two modes of queries they can run in: Native and normal. In normal mode the query is processed by the gui that rewrites it for the specific SQL engine you use. In ''Native mode'' it does not. In ''Native mode'' you can use server-specific commands, in normal mode you can't. &lt;!--- Sby plz add named parameters too. And why I can't reach my GUI created tables in native mode, I also don't know. For now knowing what to switch is a great help! --&gt;

==Reports==
Reports are like queries but offer more layout options for outputting your query results. In the Report Wizard, you are offered to group your results, then you are offered to sort the results. You can change the formatting and set page breaks too.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:130%&quot;&gt; '''''(Local Manual of Style)'''''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


== Content ==

You can help this project by editing and adding new content to the existing materials or by creating completely new pages. If you want to do something more than just &quot;cosmetic&quot; editing, you have to have something new and original to say. Do not repeat and reproduce classic trite circuit explanations that do not explain anything. Just present your viewpoint at the circuit discussed, your own philosophy about circuits and phenomena behind them.

If you are a teacher, student, inventor, designer, etc. who has encountered an interesting circuit solution, write your teacher's, student's, inventor's, designer's, etc. circuit story.

== Tools ==

Do not use complex formulas to explain circuits; they [[Circuit Idea/Formulas|cannot reveal circuit ideas]]. Mathematical models hide circuit structure and causality in circuit operation that we need to reveal, in order to understand circuits. Use rather qualitative than quantitative analyzing tools; treat readers as human beings, not as computers.

== Different view points ==
 
Avoid removing a content from the existing pages; instead, add new content to them. Express your different viewpoint at the subject in a parallel section or in a separate page; it is wonderful, if there are a few different viewpoints at the same circuit. Leave the curious reader to choose the favorite viewpoint.

== Tone ==

Remember, this is not a classic electronics book; it relies on human imagination, intuition and emotions of creative thinking readers. So, you have to motivate, inspire and induce creativity in these people. For this purpose, use more informal style of writing than usual for technical books; let it sounds more like the way people really talk. We want the book we write to read like an actual person wrote it. Apply various devices of style to make circuit stories interesting and captivating.

== Language ==

Don't use a formal, stuffy language; instead use a direct, informal language. Still more, use an imagery, figurative, catchy and colorful language to plot pictures in reader's mind. You may do that by applying various techniques: ''personification'' (give human traits to circuits), ''simile'' (compare two different things), ''metaphors'' (show the resemblance between two things by implied comparison), humor, jokes, etc. Generally speaking, use rather ''fiction'' than ''technical book'' style. Do not use passive voice; whenever it is possible, use active and the first person voice (feel free to say &quot;we&quot;, Wikibooks is not Wikipedia).

== Images ==

Do not forget that &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words&quot;; so, insert as much as possible images into the text.

[[Image:opampinverting.svg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Op-amp inverting amplifier (a classical circuit diagram)&lt;/center&gt;]]


Do not draw classical black-and-white circuit diagrams. Although they look pretty (thanks to perfect graphic editors), actually they are dull, formal and low informative. In many cases, conventional circuit diagrams do not give something more than a well written imaginary and fanciful text. They look as static photos that do not render circuit operation.

As a rule, classical circuit diagrams do not show input sources, loads and power supplies. As a result, readers do not know where currents flow. Also, they do not show what are the magnitudes and polarities of the voltages in the important circuit points.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:V-to-i inv ampl 1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Op-amp inverting amplifier (a more informative diagram)&lt;/center&gt;]]

Draw informative, colored circuit diagrams enriched with little men, voltage bars and diagrams, current loops and other means visualizing the invisible electrical attributes. Use different colors to mark the various electrical attributes (voltage - red, current - green, resistance - black, etc.) Circle the circuit components that form well-known simpler circuit building blocks by a different light color (yellow, purple, blue, etc.) Write explanatory texts over the circuit diagrams. Use the same color for the texts and the according enclosing loops to associate them. Feel free to place the text inside explanatory balloons (likewise comics).

Try to express the movement (the change) into the circuit operation (e.g., by superimposing different phases of the operation). If it is possible, your diagrams have to look rather as dynamic movies than as static photos.

Handmade (freehand) circuit diagrams are completely acceptable and even advisable. The only problem is that they are difficult to edit. If you decide to redraw them by using a vector graphics editor, please do not truncate them.

== The classical approach ==

[[File:Active_rc_integrator_how_to_convert_450.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Nobody shows us how to transform imperfect passive circuits into almost ideal active ones.&lt;/center&gt;]]

As a rule, classic electronics courses follow a traditional &quot;scenario&quot;: first, authors present electronic circuits in their complete, final and perfect form; then, authors analyze accurately circuits by using abstract formal methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;ewme&quot;&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my_work/conferences/ewme_2006/paper.htm A heuristic approach to teaching analog electronics] relies on human imagination, intuition and emotions.&lt;/ref&gt; This classical teaching approach predominates in electronics education; just look around and you will see that it is everywhere: in books, magazines and web sites authors present ready-made circuit solutions; in lecture halls teachers try to explain qualitative circuit phenomena by using quantitative tools; in educational laboratories, students carry out &quot;ascertaining&quot; experiments that only confirm the rightness of predominating circuit ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;hidden ideas&quot;&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Why Circuit Ideas are Hidden#Looking for an answer in second-hand sources|Why Circuit Ideas are Hidden]] (Looking for an answer in second-hand sources)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, there is no place for revealing basic circuit ideas. Nobody shows what we, human beings, actually need - ''what basic circuit ideas are'', ''where new circuit ideas come from'' and ''how they have been evolving through years'', in order to be able to invent new circuits. In this way, relying mainly on logical reasoning, education suppresses the most human capability that we possess owing to our imagination - ''to create and even invent things, which do not exist in nature''. Thus education does not induce creativity in student minds.

For example, nobody shows us the relation between the passive and active versions of the same circuits. First, they present passive electric circuits (e.g., passive RC integrator) as ready-made circuit solutions and persuade us how imperfect they are. Then, they give us active electronic circuits (e.g., op-amp inverting RC integrator) and persuade us now how perfect they are. Only, although they present passive and active versions separately, we guess that they are related. So, nobody shows us what we actually need - ''how to transform imperfect passive circuits into almost ideal active electronic circuits''. If we only know how, we will be able to understand and even to invent more new electronic circuits!

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== A need of human-friendly philosophy ==

[[File:V-to-i inv ampl 1000.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;In the popular circuit of an ''op-amp inverting amplifier'' we might discern the simpler ''V-to-I converter'' and ''I-to-V converter''.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Only, we are not robots or computers but ordinary human beings; no cold engine oil but warm human blood flows in our veins. Examining complicated mixtures of electronic components we try to discern desperately simpler circuit building blocks and to associate the abstract circuit idea with well-known everyday situations. For example, we might think that the popular circuit of an op-amp inverting amplifier is composed of two simpler converters: a [[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter|passive voltage-to-current converter]] and an [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter|active current-to-voltage converter]] unified by the famous [[w:Virtual ground|virtual ground]] phenomenon.

We human beings, do not think in terms of formal analysis when understanding, explaining and inventing circuits.&lt;ref&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Formulas|Why Formulas Cannot Explain Circuits]]&lt;/ref&gt; We need first to understand qualitative things by qualitative means; then, to compute quantitative things by quantitative means. In electronics, that means first to understand, build and invent circuits by using human intuition, imagination and emotions; then, to define exactly the circuit parameters and to analyze thoroughly the circuit operation by using formal methods.

We need not only concrete technical explanations and calculations. First of all, we, human beings, need a human-friendly circuit philosophy.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Philosophy foundations ==

In this wikibook, we establish a novel circuit philosophy as an alternative to the classical formal approach. The new philosophy relies more on human imagination than on logical reasoning. It considers analog circuitry more as art than science and the creation of electronic circuits as a result of human fantasy, imagination and enthusiasm.

=== A heuristic approach ===

==== Reinventing electronic circuits ====

The best way of understanding and presenting unfamiliar circuits is to &quot;invent&quot; them again. So, instead of presenting circuits as finished cut-and-dried solutions we may reinvent them including the very students in this &quot;game&quot;. In this way, reproducing the inventing process, we can show the evolution of circuit ideas. This helps students to master a set of circuit design techniques and tricks, which enables them later to construct and... why not to invent new circuits?

==== Levels of implementation ====

In this book, we evolve the heuristic idea at three levels:
*''At a book level'', we reveal circuit ideas generally by moving in a sequence ''passive &gt;  active &gt; negative feedback'' circuits (see the main subtitles of the content's section [[Circuit Idea#revealing|Revealing circuit ideas]]).
**''At a page level'', we expound the subject step-by-step by moving from simple to complex - imperfect to perfect, passive to active, transistor to op-amp circuits (see [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter|current-to-voltage converter]])
***''At every step inside a story'', we first reveal the [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter#Basic electrical idea: Removing voltage by an &quot;antivoltage&quot;|basic circuit idea]]; then we show the concrete [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter#Building the electronic circuit|circuit solution]].

==== A reinventing scenario ====

When we reinvent a circuit, we move from the beginning to the end. Here is such a typical ''bottom-up'' scenario:

1. Posing the problem to be solved ''(improving a passive circuit, solving a circuit contradiction, etc.)''&lt;br /&gt;
2. Revealing the basic idea in the non-electrical domain ''(looking for analogies, deriving a block-diagram and an operation algorithm)''.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Applying the general idea in the electricity domain ''(building an equivalent and a &quot;man-controlled&quot; electrical circuit)''.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Showing the passive circuit applications ''(building independent and constituent passive devices)''.&lt;br /&gt;
5. Revealing the passive circuit imperfections ''(revealing and evaluating inherent circuit errors)''.&lt;br /&gt;
6. Improving the imperfect passive circuit and creating a perfect active version ''(converting the passive circuit into an active one)''.&lt;br /&gt;
7. Applying the idea in the electronics domain ''(building various active devices based on the same idea)''.

Examples of this bottom-up reinventing approach are the stories about [[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter|passive]] and [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Voltage-to-Current Converter|active voltage-to-current converter]] that we have derived from the elementary Ohm's electric circuit.

=== A building approach ===

''Circuit idea'' is based on the belief that the truth about circuit phenomena is hidden rather in the movement from simple to complex circuits than in the final perfect circuit solutions. That is why, we do not present here circuits as ready-made solutions to be analyzed in their complete, final and perfect form. Instead, we build circuits step-by-step using more elementary building blocks that are already &quot;invented&quot;. We connect these &quot;bricks&quot; according to the basic ideas that we have derived from real life.

[[File:Par_summer_voltage_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;We can build a parallel voltage summer by a few V-to-I converters, a current summer and an I-to-V converter.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Following this building approach, in the present book we present every new more complex circuit as based on the previous simpler one. First, we derive the most elementary passive building blocks from the basic electric circuits of Ohm, Kirchoff, Thevenin and Norton. Then, we use these &quot;cubes&quot; to build more complicated compound passive circuits. Further, adding active elements in accordance with suitable basic ideas, we build various transistor circuits. Finally, applying powerful negative feedback principle in all its variety, we metamorphose these circuits into almost ideal op-amp ones.

An example of this bottom-up building approach is the story about [[Circuit Idea/Parallel Voltage Summer|parallel voltage summer]] that evolves as follows. In the initial stories, we derive the elementary [[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter|voltage-to-current converter]], [[Circuit Idea/Passive Current-to-Voltage Converter|current-to-voltage converter]] and [[Circuit Idea/Parallel Voltage Summer#Deriving the simplest current summer from KCL|current summer]]. In the next story, we use them to build a [[Circuit Idea/Parallel Voltage Summer|compound passive voltage summer]]. Finally, we add an op-amp to this passive circuit thus converting it into an [[Circuit Idea/Parallel Voltage Summer#Op-amp inverting voltage summer|active parallel voltage summer]].

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Using associations ===

We begin learning from the day we are born. In this way, in the early years of our childhood, we accumulate a knowledge of life for visible (mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, social, etc.) phenomena of our world. But this world is arranged so interesting that apparently different phenomena obey the same laws; they are ''analogous''.

[[File:Philosophy_hydraulic_analogy_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;A hydraulic analogy of an op-amp inverting integrator.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Then, why do not we use associations as educational mainstays that convey the common knowledge about visible worldly phenomena to invisible  abstract electric phenomena? Thus they will look familiar, elementary and accessible. This is so because we, human beings, begin understanding new unfamiliar things when we begin discerning something familiar inside them. We just consider new complex things as composed by a few simpler well-known components. Here are some examples of applying analogies.

When we &quot;reinvent&quot; the elementary electric circuits ([[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter#Basic non-electrical idea: Pressure causes flow|voltage-to-current converter]], [[Circuit Idea/Passive Current-to-Voltage Converter#Basic non-electrical idea: Flow causes pressure|current-to-voltage converter]], etc.) and more complex electronic circuits (e.g., op-amp inverting integrator, Deboo integrator, etc.) we use various fluid analogies (pneumatic, hydraulic, thermal, diffusion, etc.) When we try to figure out what blocking capacitors really do in an AC transistor amplifying circuit we will think of them as an electrical &quot;shock-absorbers&quot;, which move the voltage &quot;movements&quot; (see the welcome circuit diagram at the [[#top|top]]). Later, we will derive the simplest block diagram of a negative feedback system by using various driver, teacher, weight, economic, social, etc. analogies.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Visualisation ===

[[File:Voltage_diagram_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;A voltage distribution along the resistive film inside a linear potentiometer.&lt;/center&gt;]]

According to the old proverb &quot;A picture is worth a thousand words&quot;, we have to place as much as possible images in this book. When this is not possible, we will use an imagery, figurative and colorful language to plot pictures in reader's mind.

Also, we can visualize the invisible electrical attributes ''voltage'' and ''current'' by analogous geometrical attributes ''bars'' and ''loops'' that are based on the famous ''water tower'' and ''fish tank'' hydraulic analogies. In this geometrical presentation, the height of the voltage bars is proportional to the corresponding voltages and the thickness of the current loop is proportional to the magnitude of the current.

Finally, we can present the circuit operation by a voltage diagram that represents the voltage distribution along a resistive film. In this attractive geometrical presentation, local bars with corresponding height represent the local voltage drops; for simplicity, we usually draw only the envelope of the voltage diagram.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Relying on causality ===

'''Revealing causality.''' Classical electronics courses do not reveal ''cause and effect relations'' in electronic circuits. For example, who cares if there is a causality and what causes what (what quantity is an input and what - an output) in Ohm's law? Authors just suppose that voltage and current change simultaneously; they do not mind how the famous rule is written (I = V/R, V = I.R or R = V/I). 

[[File:Block_diagram_450.jpg|left|thumb|220px|&lt;center&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter|Voltage causes curent]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[File:I-to-v_block_diagram_450.jpg|right|thumb|220px|&lt;center&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Passive Current-to-Voltage Converter|Current causes voltage]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

Only, we human beings consider every change in this world as a result of some cause (in electronics that means the output quantity is a result of the input one). We cannot imagine that the input and output quantities can change simultaneously. We know that always the input is first and the output is second; so, the output always follows (delays) the input.

'''Introducing causality.''' In the case when apparently there is no causality in electronic circuits, we can introduce it. Let's for concreteness consider the example above of Ohm's law. There, we first assume that ''voltage causes current'' (I = V/R) in a voltage supplied Ohm's circuit; thus we &quot;invent&quot; the simplest [[Circuit Idea/Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter|voltage-to-current converter]].

'''Changing causality.''' But we know that this cause and effect relation is an arbitrary choice; so, we can change (reverse) it. This means we can assume with the same success that ''current causes voltage'' (V = I.R) in a current supplied Ohm's circuit; thus we &quot;invent&quot; the reverse [[Circuit Idea/Passive Current-to-Voltage Converter|current-to-voltage converter]].

Evolving this powerful idea we will (re)invent a lot of useful and original circuits by using any accessible ''circuit points'' (including circuit outputs, supply terminals, etc.) and ''component parameters'' as an input. For example, varying with resistance as an input quantity we will obtain a ''resistance-to-current'' converter'' (in the case of a voltage supplied Ohm's circuit) and a'' resistance-to-voltage converter (in the case of a current supplied Ohm's circuit). Then, applying an input voltage to the output of an emitter follower we will &quot;invent&quot; the odd ''common-base transistor amplifying stage''. Later, changing causality, we will transmute a digital-to-analog converter into a ''digital controlled amplifier''.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Applying sensomotor activities ===

In order to &quot;feel&quot; how electronic circuits operate, we have to interact with them: first, to stimulate them and then, to perceive their reactions. Of course, the best way of doing that are real and simulated laboratory experiments. In this book, we will also carry out mental experiments to establish sensomotor notions into readers.


&lt;center&gt;[[File:Philosophy_diff_amplifier.jpg|700px|&lt;center&gt;A differential amplifier visualized by voltage bars (the small rectangles represent resistors).&lt;/center&gt;]]&lt;/center&gt;


For example, when we explore the popular ''common-emitter transistor amplifying stage'', we &quot;raise&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; mentally the base voltage. Then, when we &quot;experiment&quot; with the odd ''common-base stage'', we apply an input voltage to the emitter and then &quot;wiggle&quot; it. Similarly, when we explore the classic ''differential transistor amplifier'', we &quot;move&quot; (in the same and in the contrary directions) the both input voltages to observe the differential and common-mode operation.


&lt;center&gt;[[File:ECL_logical1_1000.jpg|700px|&lt;center&gt;Visualizing what voltages are and where currents flow in ECL circuit at high input voltage (logical &quot;1&quot;).&lt;/center&gt;]]&lt;/center&gt;

=== A functional consideration ===

We may consider electronic components at various levels of abstraction. For example, we might explain how a transistor works at &quot;micro level&quot; presenting it in terms of semiconductor theory. Only that is not sufficient to explain how a particular electronic circuit works. In order to understand transistor circuits, we need to know not so much what the internal transistor structure is but '''how a transistor behaves''' in the circuit.

At this &quot;macro level&quot;, we present the transistor operation by the well-known basic concepts of electricity (''current source'', ''non-linear resistor'', ''current-to-current converter'', ''regulating element'', etc.). Thinking &quot;functionally&quot;, we imagine where currents (not particular electrons or holes) flow, what voltages and resistances across the component terminals are, etc.

Evolving this functional approach, we will implement electronic circuits at various component levels. For example, we will present a voltage amplifier at these levels: ''single transistor amplifier'', ''discrete transistor amplifier'' (built by a few transistors), ''integrated circuit amplifier'' (e.g., a single op-amp), ''negative feedback amplifier'' (here the op-amp is only a component of a system), an ''electronic device'' (now the negative feedback amplifier is only a component), etc.

=== Putting emotions to work ===

As you can see, in this book circuitry manifests more as an art than a science. Figuratively speaking, the book is a peculiar &quot;theatre&quot; where the particular circuit stories are &quot;scenes&quot;, on which electronic circuits &quot;play&quot; our &quot;scenarios&quot;:)

Emotions lie at the root of the art. We are human beings that possess emotions; we can feel, excite, love, hate, embarrass, suffer, envy, imagine, dream... but we can't function blindly as a Turing machine when analyze circuits!

So, in this book, we will love our circuits, will get excited before their &quot;premieres&quot;, will suffer when they fail and will triumph when a new circuit idea conceives in our minds!

== &quot;Assist with medication&quot; ==

Wherever it says to assist with medication (or similar) it doesn't mean to administer it. It means to do things like
*read the label to make sure they take the right dosage
*help them take the lid off of pill bottles
*find it in a purse or something
None of those things are actually ''administering'' the medication; the victim must do that themselves. This should probably be explained in some central location towards the beginning of the book (Issues in Providing Care?) and linked to whenever that phrase is used. Your thoughts? '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:02, 12 November 2007 (UTC)
:Ah, ok, I see what you mean.  Yeah, that's a good idea, since &quot;assist&quot; could be interpreted as actually assist in administering it, such as an EMT-B would do with an inhaler.  Should we put it somewhere under legal liability or create a new page for assisting with medications and how to assist, etc? [[User:Mike6271|Mike6271]] 11:36, 12 November 2007 (UTC)
::I'd say a section in Liability should be good. As long as it can't be misconstrued as you just described I'll be happy. It also needs to come before the first mention of assisting with medication.
::Lately I feel like I'm saying &quot;yes that'd be good&quot; and such, but not contributing much myself. I'm planning on putting in some work over the winter break, including the section on spinal injury assessment in [[First Aid/Extended Assessment]].
::Out of curiosity, where are you getting the images you've been adding? I assume they're from Commons. Last time I checked, there weren't many good first aid (etc) images there (or at least they were poorly categorized).

:::Ok, I will put it in liability, ''maybe'' today.  
:::Eh, I got the pictures from around.  I will be a judge at this one Boy Scout first aid meet tomorrow...I might be able to get some pictures there...if any turn out especially good with the treatment, I could probably use them on here.

[[File:Blender3D Fireworks-2.48a.ogv|framed|'''Figure 1:''' Some particle fireworks]]
How to create a firework from particles? We will use cascaded particle systems especially of the type ''Reactor''.

Abstract:
* We create a emitter object in the appropriate size.
* Than we use three successive particle systems:
** the first of the type ''Emitter''
** the second of the type ''Reactor''. This system reacts to the death of the emitter particles.
** the third again of the type ''Reactor''. This systems reacts to the proximity of the second systems and thus creates a &quot;drag&quot;.
* We create three different materials (one of them animated) and assign them to the three particle systems.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
== The Emitter ==
We use a ''Plane'' as emitter object. Scale it to your liking. I have used a relatively large particle system, so my plane has a length of 15 BU (Blender units).

[[File:Blender3D AddingAParticleSystem.png|framed|'''Figure 2a:''' Adding particle systems. First particle system on the left hand side, a second particle system on the right hand side]]
* Add a particle system ('''Fig&amp;nbsp;2a''', left hand side).
** ''Amount:'' 25
** ''Sta:'' 1
** ''End:'' 250
** ''Emit from:'' 
*** ''Random''
*** ''Faces''
*** ''Even''
*** ''Random''
** ''Initial Velocity''
*** ''Normal:'' 22
*** ''Random:'' 7
** ''AccZ:'' -9.8
** ''Visualisation:'' ''Line''
*** ''Back:'' 1.1
A few particles (25) are created in the first 250 frames of the animation and emitted upwards. Gravitation, velocity and lifetime are adjusted so, that the particles reach the end of their lifetime at the topmost point of their trajectory.

The ''Line'' visualization lets the particles appear as long drawn-out line.

* ''Bake'' the particle system. Use 500 as the ''End'' frame for bake. 300 would be sufficient here, but 500 do no harm.

Noob Note: Bake is in the Bake tab next to particle system tab in particle buttons window.

The plane will get a ''Halo'' material. 
* Activate ''Halo'' in the ''Links and Pipeline'' panel.
* ''Halo:'' color red
* ''Halo Size:'' 0.421
* ''Hard:'' 35

I've adjusted the size and hardness of the halo so long until I liked it, so there is no specific reason to use these values.

== Reactor 1 ==
* Click on the arrow next to ''1 Part 1'' in the ''Particle System'' panel.
* The settings for the first particle system are no longer shown, now it reads ''1 Part 2'' ('''Fig.&amp;nbsp;2a''', right hand side).
* Click on ''Add New'', now it reads ''2 Part 2''. 
You just have created a second particle system. Rename this system, a good naming convention will help you a lot to keep the overview.

[[File:Blender3D Fireworks-Reactor1-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 3a:''' The first reactor system]]
* Activate ''React on: Death''. 
* ''Life:'' 104
* ''Emit from:'' ''Particles''
You don't have to set anything for the ''Target''. It is not necessary to set the target object if it is the same object as the reactor.  You just have to set the number of the target particle system eventually.

The ''Reactor'' particles react on the ''Death'' of the particles of the target system. They will be emitted from the point that the particles occupy at their death.

To control the movement of the system, I have made following setting in the ''Physics'' panel:
* ''Particle:'' 0.345
* ''Reactor:'' 10
* ''AccZ:'' -0.09
* ''Brown:'' 3.86
Because of the ''Reactor'' setting the star is moving away from the emitting particles. The ''Brown'' movement lets the trajectory appear trembling like affected by wind.

* Set the material number to &quot;2&quot; in the ''Visualization'' panel.
* Bake the system, again use 500 as end frame.

=== Material 2 ===
[[File:Blender3D Fireworks-Reactor1-Material-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 3b:''' Material settings for the 1. ''Reactor'' system]]
* At first you have to assign a new material in the ''Link and Materials'' panel of the ''Editing'' Buttons.
* Use the material settings from '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;3b''', 
* The material also gets a ''Clouds'' texture with ''Noise'' depth &quot;3&quot;, simply leave all other settings unchanged.
The texture is actually superfluous here, but the next particle system is given the same texture, and colors should be adjusted a bit.

* Animate the ''Alpha'' value of the material.
** Set the first Ipo key in frame 1 (''Alpha=1''). To do that move your mouse cursor over the ''Buttons'' window. Press '''I'''-&gt;''Alpha'' (and change ipo type to material in the ipo curve editor if you are using that).
** Set the second Ipo key in frame 86 (''Alpha=0.75'').
** Set the third key in Frame frame 101 (''Alpha=0.0'').
The second particle system is faded off relatively quickly, but the particles don't disappear suddenly.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

== Smoke Trail ==
[[File:Blender3D Fireworks-Reactor2-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 4a:''' Particle system for the trail]]
The third (and last) particle system is again a ''Reactor'' system and is reacting to the second system. It's going to react to the ''Nearness'' of the particles. Without moving the variation of the particles is created with a texture and a random variation of their lifespan. What Blender considers as close can be changed with the particle ''Size''.

* Create a third particle system (like you created the second).
* Use the settings from '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;4a'''. Important are the settings:
** ''Amount:'' 100000
** ''React on:'' ''Near''
** ''Emit from:'' ''Particles''
** ''Life:'' 75
** ''Rand:'' 0.4
** ''Target Sys:'' 2
** ''Material:'' 3
*  Bake the system, again use 500 as end frame.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
=== Material 3 ===
[[ File:Blender3D Fireworks-Reactor2-Material-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 4b:''' Material for the ''Trail'' particle system]]
* At first you have to assign a new material (the third) to the object in the ''Link and Materials'' panel of the object buttons.
* Assign the existing ''Clouds'' texture from material 2 also to material 3, but select a dark blue as target color (in the ''Map To'' panel).

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

== Render ==
* Render your animation, use end frame 500.

That's all. I hope you were able to follow the tutorial. Criticism and suggestions, write best on the talk page or improve the article directly.

^Where is the blend file? I can't seem to find it anywhere.

== Replaced Text ==
The tutorial was not touched for over a year, and not finished either. So I'm going to replace it with my own tutorial. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 16:05, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

== Particles freezing and dissapearing after frame 250 ==

After frame 250 all particle activity ceases - the particles already generated freeze in place and are removed one-by-one without fade.

Including a final blend file for the tutorial would be extremely useful for picking apart to see how the particle and material interactions are supposed to work.
: ''Bake the particle system. Use 500 as the End frame for bake. 300 would be sufficient here, but 500 do no harm.''. And so forth. The end frame for bake is important for the length of the simulation. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 04:39, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

I was surprised by it a lot. Thank you. I think the reactor 1 particles should be more heavier.

{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Specialised Tasks}}

There are several Haskell libraries for XML work, and additional ones for HTML. For more web-specific work, you may want to refer to the [[Haskell/Web programming]] chapter.

===Libraries for parsing XML===

* [http://www.fh-wedel.de/~si/HXmlToolbox/ The Haskell XML Toolbox (hxt)] is a collection of tools for parsing XML, aiming at a more general approach than the other tools.
* [http://projects.haskell.org/HaXml/ HaXml] is a collection of utilities for parsing, filtering, transforming, and generating XML documents using Haskell.
* [http://www.flightlab.com/~joe/hxml/ HXML] is a non-validating, lazy, space efficient parser that can work as a drop-in replacement for HaXml.
* [https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xml-conduit xml-conduit] provides parsing and rendering functions for XML. For a tutorial see [http://www.yesodweb.com/book/xml].

===Libraries for generating XML===

* HSXML represents XML documents as statically typesafe s-expressions.

===Other options===

* [http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/darcs/tagsoup/tagsoup.htm tagsoup] is a library for parsing unstructured HTML, i.e. it does not assume validity or even well-formedness of the data.

==Getting acquainted with HXT==

In the following, we are going to use the Haskell XML Toolbox for our examples.  You should have a working [[Haskell/Getting set up|installation of GHC]], including GHCi, and you should have downloaded and installed HXT according to [http://www.fh-wedel.de/~si/HXmlToolbox/#install the instructions].

With those in place, we are ready to start playing with HXT.  Let's bring the XML parser into scope, and parse a simple XML-formatted string:

  Prelude&gt; ''':m + Text.XML.HXT.Parser.XmlParsec'''
  Prelude Text.XML.HXT.Parser.XmlParsec&gt; '''xread &quot;&lt;foo&gt;abc&lt;bar/&gt;def&lt;/foo&gt;&quot;'''
  [NTree (XTag (QN {namePrefix = &quot;&quot;, localPart = &quot;foo&quot;, namespaceUri = &quot;&quot;}) [])
  [NTree (XText &quot;abc&quot;) [],NTree (XTag (QN {namePrefix = &quot;&quot;, localPart = &quot;bar&quot;,
  namespaceUri = &quot;&quot;}) []) [],NTree (XText &quot;def&quot;) []]]

We see that HXT represents an XML document as a list of trees, where the nodes can be constructed as an XTag containing a list of subtrees, or an XText containing a string.  With GHCi, we can explore this in more detail:

  Prelude Text.XML.HXT.Parser.XmlParsec Text.XML.HXT.DOM&gt; ''':i NTree
  data NTree a = NTree a (NTrees a)  
                                  -- Defined in Data.Tree.NTree.TypeDefs
  Prelude Text.XML.HXT.Parser.XmlParsec Text.XML.HXT.DOM&gt; ''':i NTrees
  type NTrees a = [NTree a]       -- Defined in Data.Tree.NTree.TypeDefs

As we can see, an NTree is a general tree structure where a node stores its children in a list, and some more browsing around will tell us that XML documents are trees over an XNode type, defined as:

  data XNode
    = XText String
    | XCharRef Int
    | XEntityRef String
    | XCmt String
    | XCdata String
    | XPi QName XmlTrees
    | XTag QName XmlTrees
    | XDTD DTDElem Attributes
    | XAttr QName
    | XError Int String

Returning to our example, we notice that while HXT successfully parsed our input, one might desire a more lucid presentation for human consumption.  Lucky for us, the DOM module supplies this.  Notice that xread returns a list of trees, while the formatting function works on a single tree.

  Prelude Text.XML.HXT.Parser.XmlParsec&gt; :m + Text.XML.HXT.DOM
  Prelude Text.XML.HXT.Parser.XmlParsec Text.XML.HXT.DOM&gt; '''putStrLn $ formatXmlTree $ head $ xread &quot;&lt;foo&gt;abc&lt;bar/&gt;def&lt;/foo&gt;&quot;
  ---XTag &quot;foo&quot;
     |
     +---XText &quot;abc&quot;
     |
     +---XTag &quot;bar&quot;
     |
     +---XText &quot;def&quot;

This representation makes the structure obvious, and it is easy to see the relationship to our input string.  Let's proceed to extend our XML document with some attributes (taking care to escape the quotes, of course):

  Prelude Text.XML.HXT.Parser.XmlParsec&gt; '''xread &quot;&lt;foo a1=\&quot;my\&quot; b2=\&quot;oh\&quot;&gt;abc&lt;bar/&gt;def&lt;/foo&gt;&quot;
  [NTree (XTag (QN {namePrefix = &quot;&quot;, localPart = &quot;foo&quot;, namespaceUri = &quot;&quot;}) [NTree (XAttr (QN
  {namePrefix = &quot;&quot;, localPart = &quot;a1&quot;, namespaceUri = &quot;&quot;})) [NTree (XText &quot;my&quot;) []],NTree (XAttr
  (QN {namePrefix = &quot;&quot;, localPart = &quot;b2&quot;, namespaceUri = &quot;&quot;})) [NTree (XText &quot;oh&quot;) []]]) [NTree
  (XText &quot;abc&quot;) [],NTree (XTag (QN {namePrefix = &quot;&quot;, localPart = &quot;bar&quot;, namespaceUri = &quot;&quot;}) [])
  [],NTree (XText &quot;def&quot;) []]]

Notice that attributes are stored as regular NTree nodes with the XAttr content type, and (of course) no children.  Feel free to pretty-print this expression, as we did above.

For a trivial example of data extraction, consider this small example using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath XPath]:

  Prelude&gt; :set prompt &quot;&gt; &quot;
  &gt; :m + Text.XML.HXT.Parser.XmlParsec Text.XML.HXT.XPath.XPathEval
  &gt; let xml = &quot;&lt;foo&gt;&lt;a&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;c&gt;C&lt;/c&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;&quot;
  &gt; let xmltree = head $ xread xml
  &gt; let result = getXPath &quot;//a&quot; xmltree
  &gt; result
  &gt; [NTree (XTag (QN {namePrefix = &quot;&quot;, localPart = &quot;a&quot;, namespaceUri = &quot;&quot;}) []) [NTree (XText &quot;A&quot;) []]]
  &gt; :t result
  &gt; result :: NTrees XNode

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book represents the beginning of a multi-year project to create a digital textbook based on the [http://www.ode.state.oh.us/GD/Templates/Pages/ODE/ODEDetail.aspx?page=3&amp;TopicRelationID=335&amp;ContentID=852&amp;Content=18582 Ohio 7th grade social studies content standards].  The first two chapters were completed by two different classes and represent information concerning the Middle Ages, Feudalism, the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation.  Students chose different topics that correspond to specific concepts outlined in Ohio’s curriculum standards.  
 
Students at Beachwood Middle School are creating this book. [http://www.beachwood.k12.oh.us/index.html Beachwood City Schools] are located in Beachwood, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland. Beachwood Middle School incorporates technology in the classroom through a one-to-one laptop program.  The information you read in this digital textbook is completely student-generated (excluding this introduction).  Students spent several weeks brainstorming, reviewing their notes and previous projects, and collaborating in small groups.  It is because of their dedication and achievement as life-long learners that this project is possible.  These students also had the courage to take a risk with their teachers and use the last few weeks of school to do something truly unique.
 
This textbook is the result of over a year of collaboration between several individuals. [http://www.beachwood.k12.oh.us/bms/holman/Index.html Garth Holman], the Social Studies department chair and 7th grade world history teacher envisioned this project as a way to engage students through the use of technology and help them see the “big picture” that is often lost, or ignored, in history classes.  Beginning in the summer of 2006, Garth began working with a student teacher, Michael Pennington.  Another member of this project was Angie White, an intervention specialist at Beachwood Middle School.  Angie provided a strong knowledge of curriculum differentiation and techniques to include students of varying abilities.  A project of this nature, allows students to disseminate knowledge in a digital format that is congruent to the world in which they live.  Our students are digital natives and this new technological paradigm allows for the democratization of knowledge.  Wiki technology and the ability to instantaneously communicate across cultures and physical boundaries means that nothing our students create is isolated.  We not only want our students to learn, but understand how the puzzle pieces fit to create the world in which we live. 
 
It all started with a basic question, “how do you engage students and allow them to show what they know”.  Burgeoning technologies require teachers to rethink assessment and adapt to their students.  Teachers prepare students for their future, not our past.  Life does not occur in a vacuum, yet too often textbooks and curriculum categorize and isolate historical episodes.  Our students connected the historical dots using written summaries, hyper-links, digital imagery, and iMovie.  The ultimate goal of this book is not only to explain important moments in history, but also understand the long-term effects of each moment.

As shown in the quick start guide, you just go to where you import clips, select image clip, and add to the project!

You then set the duration, etc.

Then drop it into the timeline, and there you have a picture!

      <text xml:space="preserve">The question of whether the Universe is infinite or not depends crucially on the value of the quantity know as Ω. Such a value, although not determined yet, depends basically on the rate of expansion, or the [[Hubble Constant]], of the Universe.

In simple terms, the quantity Ω is the ratio of the density of the universe (mass per unit volume) to the critical value which determines expansion or collapse.
There are three possible outcomes from this value - 
* Steady State: the Universe will continue to expand up to a point, whereupon the Universe will stay in a constant state. This would occur if Ω = 1.
* Continuous Expansion: The Universe will continue to expand. This will occur if Ω&lt;1. The result of continuous expansion would be, according to the 1st Law of Thermodynamics, a Universe which would gradually cool down until the temperature became 0 Kelvin.
* Regression: The Universe will grow, and then collapse on itself. This will occur if Ω&gt;1. It has been postulated that if the Universe were to carry on this course, all matter would recondense into a singularity, and recreate another big bang.

'''Eel sauce''' (kabayaki sauce) is commonly used in the preparation of [[Cookbook:Broiling|broiled]] fresh water eel (unagi) and salt water eel (anago.) The thick, sweet, hickory flavored sauce is heated and drizzled on sushi prepared with eel. Eel sauce is also delicious with other sushi and non-sushi creations alike. Eel sauce includes [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]], syrup, fertilized eel eggs, and mirin. The texture and flavor is a perfect match for toasted unagi. It is best to heat eel sauce in a metal or glass container placed in 3/4 inch boiling water on the stove.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Does this section makes any sense now? There is a blender material repository that contains public domain materials here http://repository.parastudios.de/ .

I second this - at least we could mention this new repository in the page so people have something to look for more pre-fab materials. I like the existing entries here anyway, they are nicely illustrated and provide at least ''some'' insight into material creation. --[[User:80.109.73.21|80.109.73.21]] 08:30, 22 July 2007 (UTC)


I like this page's focus upon the various settings and methods.  It should stay.

== Every Material Known to Man Expansion ==
This section has an incredible amount of potential, and I believe it needs to be greatly expanded upon. Please do not delete the RED Links as they will be useful to help suggest to someone to contribute. If you think of more materials, even if you can't make it, add a link to an empty page for it as a hint to other contributors. Hopefully, we can get this page it's own Chapter, and then people will really visit it and it will REALLY expand!!!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Analytic Tableaux==
In this section we present a calculus, namely analytic tableau, which is an alternative to resolution. Although this calculus was developed independently from resolution, it will turn out that there are some interesting common features. The most obvious difference is, that analytic tableau work direct on formulae, there is no need to transform a formulae in a clausal normal form.

==Tableaux - A Short History==
The development of tableaux calculi started in the 1950th. The first
authors to be mentioned are Beth (1955), Hintikka (1955) and Schütte
(1956). Their goal was primarily to develop calculi without
meta-language constructs. Later in the 1960th the idea of derivation
trees and nodes in such a  tree labeled by formulae became famous as
the concept of ''analytic tableaux'' introduced by Smullyan 1968. The
idea of mechanisation of tableaux calculi was then introduced by
Kanger 1957, Prawitz 1960, Wang 1960,  Davis 1960 and  Maslov 1968.

Later on the concept of analytic tableaux was modified and refined
for its use in automated deduction by Loveland 1968 (Model
elimination), Kowalski, Kuehner 1971 (SL-resolution) and  Bibel 1975,
Andrews 1976 (Connection or matings methods).
Nowadays there are numerous high performance theorem provers based on
this work.

==The Calculus==
One of the advantages of tableaux calculi is that can be defined
without transforming the formula into clause normal form.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Example''' Given a set of formulae &lt;math&gt;\{\lnot P \land \lnot (Q \lor R), \lnot (Q \land \lnot
R)\}&lt;/math&gt; . We are aiming at constructing a tree, whose branches contain
nodes which are labeled with formulae.


For this it is important to analyse the  formula 
according to its leading connective.  Smullyan
observed that some work can be saved if non-literal formulas are
grouped into types which are treated identically: &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for
formulas of conjunctive type, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; for formulas of disjunctive
type in the propositional case. Note that in the above example &lt;math&gt;\lnot (Q
\land \lnot R)&lt;/math&gt; has to be treated as a formula of disjunctive type, because
of the negation standing in front of the conjunction.
Correspondence between formulas and their types is summarised in Table 1.
The letters &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;  are used to
denote formulas of (and only of) the appropriate type.
Let us now define the basic data structure for tableaux calculi
together with the corresponding extension rules.

==Definition 13==
A tableau for a logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;  is a finitely branching tree whose nodes are formulas from &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. A branch in a tableau &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal path in&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. When no confusion can arise, branches are frequently identified with the set of their nodes (formulas).  Given a set &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; of formulae
from &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, a tableau for &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is constructed by a (possibly infinite) sequence of applications of the following rules:
 
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Table1Correspondance between.png]]&lt;/center&gt;
    
#The tree consisting of a single node &lt;math&gt;true&lt;/math&gt; is a tableau for &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; (initialisation rule).   
#Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a tableau for &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; a branch of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; a formula in &lt;math&gt;B\cup\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. If the tree &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; is constructed by extending &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; by as many new linear subtrees as an instance of a tableau rule schema in Table 2 with premise &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; has extensions, and the nodes of the new subtrees are the formulas in the extensions of the rule instance, then &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; is a tableau for &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; (expansion rule).
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:table2Correspondance.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

One tableau for our example is depicted in figure 2.

==Definition 14==
In a tableau &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; for a set &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; of sentences a branch &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is
closed iff &lt;math&gt;B\cup\Phi&lt;/math&gt; contains a pair
&lt;math&gt;\phi,\lnot\phi&lt;/math&gt; of complementary formulas, or &lt;math&gt;false&lt;/math&gt;; otherwise, it is open.  A tableau is closed if ''all''  its branches are closed.
A tableau proof for (the unsatisfiability of) a set &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; of formulae is a closed tableau &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;.

==Problem 31 (Propositional)==
Give a strict tableau proof for the following formulae:

#&lt;math&gt;\lnot((A \downarrow B) \downarrow (A \lor B))&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;((A \to B) \land (B \to C)) \to (\lnot (\lnot C \land A))&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Figure2Atableaufora.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

==Clause Normalform Tableau==
Let us now refine the calculus for the special case, that we deal with
sets of  clauses, which represent a formula in CNF. Note that in the
case of conjunctive normal form clauses we only have literals, which
are connected by &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt;-junctors. Hence every clause is of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-type. In
figure 3 a tableau for a set of clauses is given. The
clauses from the given clause set  form the initial tableau; then
there is  only the  &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-rule applicable for further extensions of the
tableau.

In the following formal definition of a clause normal form tableau we start with an initial tableau,
which is formed by taking an arbitrary clause from the given clause set S. For further extensions of
the tableau &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-rule-applications with clauses from S can be used. Which of the clauses is allowed is
controlled by a ''link condition''.

==Definition 15==
A clause (normalform) tableau for a set of clauses &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;  is a tableau
for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, whose nodes are literals from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and which is constructed by 
a (possibly infinite) sequence of applications of the following rules:

  
#The tree consisting of root  &lt;math&gt;true&lt;/math&gt; and immediate successors     &lt;math&gt;L_1, \cdots , L_n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C = L_1, \cdots , L_n \in S&lt;/math&gt; is a tableau for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; (initialisation rule).   
#Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a tableau for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; a branch of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C=L_1, \cdots ,L_n \in S&lt;/math&gt;, such that the     link-condition (see below)  is satisfied.  If the tree &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; is constructed by extending &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; by the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; subtrees &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; is a tableau     for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; (expansion rule). 

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:figure3tableau.png]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The following are three possible link conditions:
  
#No condition.  
#Weak link condition: There is a literal &lt;math&gt;L \in B&lt;/math&gt; and   &lt;math&gt;\overline{L} \in C&lt;/math&gt;. 
#Strong link condition: Let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be the leaf of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;,   then there is &lt;math&gt;\overline{L} \in C&lt;/math&gt;. 
In fact we have defined three different calculi:
  
*Without link condition it is called clause normal form tableau, 
*with the weak link condition we call it connection calculus, and  
*with the strong link condition it is called model elimination.


An example for clause normal form tableau was given in figure 3. An example for a connection
calculus tableau is&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:tableau1.png]]&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

and finally a model elimination tableau is given by&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:tableau2.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

==Theorem 11==
Clause normal form tableau are complete.&lt;br&gt;
Note that strong link condition do not allow for confluent &lt;ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a set and &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; a binary relation on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;(M, \to)&lt;/math&gt; is called confluent if
&lt;math&gt;
\text{for all }  u,v,x,y \; \text{ and }  \; u \stackrel{*}{\to} x \; \text{ and } \; u \; \stackrel{*}{\to} \; y \;\; \text{ there is a } \; z \; \text{ with } \; x
\stackrel{*}{\to} \; z \;  \text{ and }  y \; \stackrel{*}{\to}\; z
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

proof procedures. If no link condition
(i.e. the empty one) is applied it is trivial to get a confluent version. For the case of weak link
condition this is not obvious.
In order to arrive at a decision procedure for propositional clauses we need an extra condition:

==Definition 16==
A branch &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; of a tableau for a clause set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is called regular, if no literal occurs more
then once.

==Theorem 12==
Clause normal form tableau with regularity and link condition give a decision procedure
for propositional logic.

==Problem (diagnosis)==
Consider this electronic
circuit with two input lines and one output line:
&lt;center&gt;

[[Image:Image-Inv-inv.png ]]
&lt;/center&gt;
Suppose, as depicted, that both input lines are &quot;1&quot; and that the
output line is &quot;1&quot;, thus contradicting the expected output value
&quot;0&quot;. 
  
#First, formalize the circuit, i.e. the functionality of the three components and the two connections by neglecting the possibility of not correctly functioning components (i.e. do not use ''abnormal'' -Literals). 
# Consider the value pairs &quot;0-0&quot;,  &quot;1-0&quot; and &quot;1-1&quot; to be supplied to the input lines. For each of these, using the result from (1) compute the expected output value by means of analytic tableau.  How did you read off the results from the tableaux? 
#Use your formalization and analytic tableau to prove that the output value &quot;1&quot; contradicts the expected behavior in case of input &quot;1-1&quot;. How did you read off the result from the tableau? 
#Now modify the formalization of the components in (1) by  ''abnormal'' -literals as shown in class.  Use analytic tableau to compute all possible diagnosis for the input &quot;1-1&quot; and output &quot;1&quot;. How did you read off the result from the tableau?

Some supplications from the Koran.

== Asking Forgiveness and Mercy ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our Lord, do not mind us if we forget or make mistakes; our Lord, do not place a burden upon us as You have placed upon those before us; our Lord, do not place upon us what we cannot bare; pardon us, and ''forgive'' us, and have mercy on us; You are our patron, grant us victory over the disbelieving people. ([[s:Quran/2#284-286 | 2: 286]])

      <comment>/* VLSI Design Flow */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In this book '''Chip Design''' we tell how to build an integrated circuit (&quot;chip&quot;) by integrating billions of transistors to achieve an application. An Application could be suiting a particular requirement like Microprocessor,Router,cell phone,etc. An Integrated circuit designed for a specific application is called as ASIC(Application Specific Integrated Circuits). 

Today's ASIC Chips are pretty complex packed with larger chunk of transistors targeted to a specific manufacturing process for fabricating the integrated circuits, in a sub nanometer regime, involving many of challenges, like knowledge of various protocols, architectures, models, formats, standards, knowledge about CMOS logic, Digital Design concepts, taming the EDA tool for the various design requirements like area, timing, power, thermal, noise, routability, lithography aware, knowledge about various variabilities like channel length, Vt, line width variations, lens aberrations, IR drop effects, inter-die, intra die-variations, effects, and various noise-effects like Package noise, EMI noise, power grid noise,cross-talk noise, and ability to test and validate and know to model and characterize all these effects upfront in the design-phase,steps to increase yield to increase profitability curve, with short span of time-to market to minimize the risk and maximize the predictability and an modular approach to Success. Now let's delve in to the &quot;Art of Chip Designing&quot;

That is a lot of technical jargon, but there is nothing to worry about. You will soon learn what that means, and understand the concepts behind chip designing.

== Before Designing a Chip? Need to Brain Storm ==

* What market is the Chip targeted for?
* What are the Protocols involved in the Chip?
* What is going to be our Processor/Bus Architectures?
* what is the power/IR-drop/timing/Area/Yield/ targets and how to budget it in the Chip?
* What is the process in which the Chip going to be manufactured?
* what are the various third party IP's/Memory requirements?
* what is our Design flow and EDA tools and methodology involved?
* What is the estimated Chip Cost?
* Above all the bottom line of any business model is money. What is our Profit model? What is our estimated ROI(Return of investment)?

== Analogy of Chip Design Architecture Vs Building Architecture. ==

Why an Analogy with Building Architecture? To understand the concepts of Chip designing in a better way, as we are very familiar with Building Architecture, then it will be easy for us to map Chip Design architecture.

VLSI(Very large scale Integration) flow was evolved similar to the flow involved in Building Construction. Now let us delve in to the construction flow to better understand the VLSI Chip design flow development.

When ever we start to construct a building, we will have an architecture, how the building should look like , the exterior looks and all, similar to that we will be designing an architecture in the chip-design, based on the requirement of the product, what the product is addressed for and whom to serve what needs, the so called specification, will having the modules.

Now lets go in to the implementation part of both the Building &amp; Chip.

We at first come with the floorplan of the building, similarly we come with the floorplan of the Chip, Based on the connectivity/accessibility/vaasthu we place our rooms, similarly we have the constraints to place the blocks. Like we build the building with bricks, for Chip Design we have libraries, which are like pre-designed bricks, for a specific functionality.

Now let us try to understand the power-structure or electrical connectivity in our Building. Initially we have an Electrical plan for our building, where we have a requirement that all our electrical gadgets needs to get power. Similar to that we have a Chip power requirement, The required power is supplied through the power-pads, over a ring like topology to have a uniform distribution across all corners of the chip, and the supply has to reach all the standard-cells(bricks for Chip-Designing).,this is called as power-grid topology in the Chip-Design, now the requirement is how well we design our Power-grid, to reduce the IR-drop so that our standard-cells get proper power requirement.

I would not make justice, if I don't discuss about clock and clock-tree in the Chip-Design flow. We have synchronous way of designing and asynchronous way of designing(difficult to verify). Majority of chips follow Synchronous way of coding, for which Static Timing Analysis is possible. For the relevancy of the flops the clock to those flops should reach at the same time from the crystal, with in some skew targets with in the chip.In order to make this happen, a step called as clock-tree is performed after power-grid is created. 

Let us try to visualize the concept behind Place &amp; Route in Chip Design. We need to undergo lot of modelling concepts, to understand the process of Chip-Designing. To have a better understanding of this concept of place and route, let us assume a society where people who are speaking different languages are living , and let us visualize that people talking of the same languages are living in a community, then the communication is much easier , similar way in the chip-designing, the standard-cells who are having design relation-ships, are placed closer in the Placement flow this concept is called as regioning. Now with in the regioning, of the groups of the standard-cells, the cells which are really sharing data, has to placed close-by so that there timing is achieved and well optimized.This step is called placement, Connectivity across the standard-cells is called as routing, the challenge is having optimized or reduced wire-lengths.

Now let us try to try to understand the concept behind signal integrity in the Chip-Design , often called us SI Effect. As our process is shrinking day by day, and our silicon-realestate is costly, we try to accommodate more and more standard-cells in the limited area, so the cells are placed in very close proximity, so the switching of one can have an impact over the others behaviour, which can make the path to be faster or slower, this issue is called as signal-integrity. So similar way in our construction in order to maintain the integrity with in the house(neighbour free-zone), within the limited zone of modurality, we try to create fences, across buildings, similarly we can think of a concept called as Shielding, the high frequency signal net with the power-nets running across. We perform spacing across the buildings, similar way we can perform spacing across the nets, which are in close proximities.

In order to validate the silicon from the manufacturability issues, the concept in the Chip Designing is Design for Test(DFT). One of the DFT techniques is scan-chain. To understand the concept of the scan-chain, we can visualize that we have a front-door entry and a back-door exit, and a person passes from the front-door and exits from the back-door exit of the building, that we are sure that there is no blocking within the rooms in the building, to make that person stuck , similar to this analogy the flip-flops are connected together creating a scan-chain and test-input values are passed from the scan-chain input of the chip and expected data is visualized in the scan-chain output of the chip, then the assumption is the chip is free from manufacturability issues like stuck-at faults(stuck-at one or stuck at zeros).


== VLSI Design Flow ==

Step 1: Prepare a Requirement Specification

Step 2: Create a Micro-Architecture Document.

Step 3: RTL(Register Transfer Level) Design &amp; Development of IP's(Intellectual Property)

Step 4: Functional verification all the IP's/Check whether the RTL is free from Linting Errors/Analyze whether the RTL is Synthesis friendly.

Step 4a: Perform Cycle-based verification(Functional) to verify the protocol behaviour of the RTL

Step 4b: Perform Property Checking , to verify the RTL implementation and the specification understanding is matching.

Step 4c: Perform Clock Domain Crossing check, to verify that proper synchronization of control/data is there to ensure reliable cross domain data transfers.

Some people use &quot;logical effort&quot; to estimating the latency in the critical path of a CMOS circuit, and hence the maximum possible speed of the circuit.&lt;ref&gt;

by Zhijie Jerry Shi 2004
&lt;/ref&gt;

Step 5: Prepare the Design Constraints file (clock definitions(frequency/uncertainty/jitter),I/O delay definitions, Output pad load definition, Design False/Multicycle-paths) to perform Synthesis, usually called as an SDC file(Synopsys constraint file, specific to Synopsys synthesis Tool (Design Compiler))

Step 6: To Perform Synthesis for the IP, the inputs to the tool are (library file(for which synthesis needs to be targeted for, which has the functional/timing information available for the standard-cell library and the wire-load models for the wires based on the fanout length of the connectivity), RTL files and the Design Constraint files, So that the Synthesis tool can perform the synthesis of the RTL files and map and optimize to meet the design-constraints requirements. After performing synthesis, as a part of the synthesis flow, need to build scan-chain connectivity based on the DFT(Design for Test) requirement, the synthesis tool (Test-compiler), builds the scan-chain.

Step 7: Check whether the Design is meeting the requirements (Functional/Timing/Area/Power/DFT) after synthesis.

Step 7a: Perform the Netlist-level Power Analysis, to know whether the design is meeting the power targets.

Step 7b: Perform Gate-level Simulation with the Synthesized Netlist to check whether the design is meeting the functional requirements.

Step 7c: Perform Formal-verification between RTL vs Synthesized Netlist to confirm that the synthesis Tool has not altered the functionality.

Step 7d: Perform STA(Static Timing Analysis) with the SDF(Standard Delay Format) file and synthesized netlist file, to check whether the Design is meeting the timing-requirements.

Step 7e: Perform Scan-Tracing , in the DFT(Design for Test) tool, to check whether the scan-chain is built based on the DFT requirement.

Step 8: Once the synthesis is performed the synthesized netlist file(VHDL/Verilog format) and the SDC (constraints file) is passed as input files to the Placement and Routing Tool to perform the back-end Activities.

Step 9: The next step is floor-planning. Floor-planning means placing the IP's based on the connectivity,placing the memories, Create the pad ring (also called the pad frame),&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
placing the Pads (Signal/power/transfer-cells(to switch voltage domains/Corner pads(proper accessibility for Package routing), meeting the SSN requirements (Simultaneous Switching Noise) that when the high-speed bus is switching that it doesn't create any noise related activities, creating an optimised floorplan, where the design meets the utilization targets of the chip.

Step 9a : Release the floor-planned information to the package team, to perform the package feasibility analysis for the pad-ring .

Step 9b: To the placement tool, rows are cut, blockages are created where the tool is prevented from placing the cells, then the physical placement of the cells is performed based on the timing/area requirements.The power-grid is built to meet the power-target's of the Chip .

Step 10: The next step is to perform the Routing., at first the Global routing and Detailed routing, meeting the DRC(Design Rule Check) requirement as per the fabrication requirement.

Step 11: After performing Routing then the routed Verilog netlist, standard-cells LEF/DEF file is taken to the Extraction tool (to extract the parasitics(RLC) values of the chip in the SPEF format(Standard parasitics Exchange Format), and the SPEF file is generated.

Step 12: Check whether the Design is meeting the requirements (Functional/Timing/Area/Power/DFT/DRC/LVS/ERC/ESD/SI/IR-Drop) after Placement and Routing step.

Step 12a: Perform the Routed Netlist-level Power Analysis, to know whether the design has met the power targets.

Step 12b: Perform Gate-level Simulation with the routed Netlist to check whether the design is meeting the functional requirement .

Step 12c: Perform Formal-verification between RTL vs routed Netlist to confirm that the place &amp; route Tool has not altered the functionality.

Step 12d: Perform STA(Static Timing Analysis) with the SPEF file and routed netlist file, to check whether the Design is meeting the timing-requirements. 

Step 12e: Perform Scan-Tracing , in the DFT tool, to check whether the scan-chain is built based on the DFT requirement, Perform the Fault-coverage with the DFT tool and Generate the ATPG test-vectors.

Step 12f: Convert the ATPG test-vector to a tester understandable format(WGL)

Step 12g: Perform DRC(Design Rule Check) verification called as Physical-verification, to confirm that the design is meeting the Fabrication requirements.

Step 12h: Perform LVS(Layout vs Schematic) check, a part of the verification which takes a routed netlist converts to spice (call it SPICE-R) and convert the Synthesized netlist(call it SPICE-S) and compare that the two are matching.

Step 12i : Perform the ERC(Electrical Rule Checking) check, to know that the design is meeting the ERC requirement.

Step 12j: Perform the ESD Check, so that the proper back-to-back diodes are placed and proper guarding is there in case if we have both analog and digital portions in our Chip. We have separate Power and Grounds for both Digital and Analog Portions, to reduce the Substrate-noise.

Step 12k: Perform separate STA(Static Timing Analysis) , to verify that the Signal-integrity of our Chip. To perform this to the STA tool, the routed netlist and SPEF file(parasitics including coupling capacitances values), are fed to the tool. This check is important as the signal-integrity effect can cause cross-talk delay and cross-talk noise effects, and hinder in the functionality/timing aspects of the design.

Step 12l: Perform IR Drop analysis, that the Power-grid is so robust enough to with-stand the static and dynamic power-drops with in the design and the IR-drop is with-in the target limits.

Step 13: Once the routed design is verified for the design constraints, then now the next step is chip-finishing activities (like metal-slotting, placing de-coupling caps). 

Step 14: Now the Chip Design is ready to go to the Fabrication unit, release files which the fab can understand, GDS file.

Step 15: After the GDS file is released , perform the LAPO check so that the database released to the fab is correct.

Step 16: Perform the Package wire-bonding, which connects the chip to the Package.

== Implementation Challenges and Solutions ==

The metric for today's ASIC Design is on one side of the coin is the maximum number of devices integrated, reduced die-size,optimal power,speed,thermal performance, addressing signal integrity, addressing reliability, enhanced yield techniques, reducing PLL jitters for reliable functionality, testability,integration of analog and digital in single SoC, Lithography friendly DRC, Functionality met, high speed interfaces to memories, the IO fabric, IO buffer analysis and selection, implementation to validate the silicon, ability to in-corporate last minute spec changes/functional &amp; timing bugs Engineering Change Orders, Optimized package feasible, development phases involving multi-geographical multi-site, complex database handling, various models/abstractions/standards/formats/Protocols, advanced process, library characterization modelling silicon, higher degree of EDA tools, design re-use standards, building designs robust enough to deal with EMI noise/package noise/power-ground noise/cross-talk noise/substrate-noise/clock-jitter/process uncertainties/IR-drop/On-chip variation and on other side of the coin, how to address all these issues right from the design stage is the challenge of today's Chip Design Industry.

This tight bonding of integration across the domains/abstractions/tools/designers/process/protocols/standards/design re-use/decision in optimal trade-offs/design know-how's/cross-culture design community needs a modular uniform approach , to bring first pass silicon success. Now let's deal with the Implementation challenges and steps to achieve it in the design-phase.

&lt;u&gt;Complex Database Handling/Multi-site Design &amp; Development&lt;/u&gt;
As now the designs are development in multi-site environment, as each site has some domain expertise and to use to the fullest it needs multi-site design and development stages, in order to maintain the database handling a proper version control management System (e.g., clearcase) is required to proper align the database , tag it with labels to know the database and finally after designing go through with proper reviews and checklist process to assure the quality of the delivery.

Steps involved in designing an optimal padring

Make sure you have corner-pads, across all the corners of the padring 
This is mainly to have the power-continuity as well as the resistance is less 
Ensure that the Padring fulfills the ESD requirement, Identify the power-domains,split the domains, Ensure common ground across all the domains. 
Ensure that the design has sufficient core power-pads. 
Choose the Drive-strength of the pads based on the current requirements, timing. 
Ensure that there is separate analog ground and power pads. 
A No-Connection Pad is used to fill out the pad-frame if there is no requirement 
for I/O's.Extra VDD/GND pads also could be used. 
Ensure that no Input/output pads are used with unconnected inputs, they consume power if the inputs float. 
Ensure that oscillator-pads are used for clock inputs. 
In-case if the design requirement for source synchronous circuits make sure that the clock and data pads are of same drive-strength. 
Breaker-pads are used to break the power-ring, and to isolate the power-structure 
Ensure that the metal-wire connected to the pin can carry sufficient amount of the current, check if more than one metal-layer is necessary to carry the maximum current provided at the pin. 
Ensure that few pad-filler cells are placed near the corner pads to ease the substrate routing requirements. 
In case of source synchronous pads, like clock and data going out, Ensure that these pads are on the centre, as the leads at the center of the package is short compared to the leads on the corners of the package, which can reduce the impact of EMI.

&lt;u&gt;Designing for Optimized Area&lt;/u&gt;
As silicon real-estate is very costly and saving is directly proportional to the company's revenue generation lot of emphasize is to design which has optimal utilization in the area-front. The steps to reduce area are 

If the path is not timing-critical, then optimize the cells to use the low-drive strength cells so that there will saving in the area. 
Abut the VDD rows 
Analyzing the utilization numbers with multiple floor-planning versions which brings up with optimized area targets.

&lt;u&gt;Designing an Optimized floorplan&lt;/u&gt;
Study the data-flow graph of the design and place the blocks accordingly, to reducing the weighted sum of area, wire-length. 
Minimize the usage of blocks other-than square shapes, having notches 
Place the blocks based on accessibility/connectivity, thereby reducing wire-length. 
Abut the memory, if the pins are one-sided, there-by area could be reduced. 
If the memory communicates to the outside world more frequently, then placing at the boundary makes much of a sense. 
Study the number of pins to be routed, with the minimum metal width allowed, estimate the routability issues. 
Study the architecture and application , so that the blocks which will be enabled should be scattered, to reduce the power-ground noise.

&lt;u&gt;Designing for Achieving Power-targets&lt;/u&gt;
As Today's IC design power plays a major-role in the design win, achieving power-targets are the major concern. 
Some of the design best-practices are Design with Multi-VDD designs, Areas which requires high performance, goes with high VDD and areas which needs low-performance are working with low Vdd's, by creating Voltage-islands and making sure that appropriate level-shifters are placed in the cross-voltage domains 
Designing with Multi-Vt's(threshold voltages), areas which require high performance, goes with low Vt, but takes lot of leakage current, and areas which require low performance with high Vt cells, which has low leakage numbers, by incorporating this design process, we can reduce the leakage power. 
As in the design, clocks consume more amount of power, placing optimal clock-gating cells, in the design and controlling them by the module enables gives a lot of power-savings. 
As clock-tree's always switch making sure that most number of clock-buffers are after the clock-gating cells, this reduces the switching there by power-reduction. 
Incorporating Dynamic Voltage &amp; Frequency scaling (DVFS) concepts based on the application , there by reducing the systems voltage and frequency numbers when the application does not require to meet the performance targets. 
Ensure the design with IR-Drop analysis and ground-bounce analysis, is with-in the design specification requirement. 
Place power-switches, so that the leakage power can be reduced.

&lt;u&gt;Designing for Achieving Frequency targets.&lt;/u&gt;
As ASIC designs are today rated by the clock frequency the design can achieve, brings with lot of performance within. The few design strategies to achieve the frequency targets.

Using logic restructuring for the areas to be timing met, 
Use the useful skew , if permissible by meeting the hold-time requirements. 
Use register retiming/time-borrowing concepts to meet the design timing requirements 
Use faster flip-flops for the timing-paths which are timing hungry. 
Use Low-Vt cells for the paths to meet the timing. 
Ensuring the design meets the frequency targets by performing STA, across all the 
functional and test modes , across all the corners, including the derating factors. 
Make sure that there exists common clock-tree paths and bifurcation happens only at the last-stage, so that the common clock-path can be removed in the delay calculation as over-head in the pessimism removal during de-rating. 
Incorporate programmable DLL(Delay locked loop) based design, for memory-controller designs, which involves round-trip delays.

&lt;u&gt;Designing for Meeting Signal-integrity targets&lt;/u&gt;
As more and more devices are getting packed, results in more congested areas, and coupling capactiances dominating the wire-capacitance, creates SI violations. Let's see now by what are all the measures we can reduce/solve it.

As clock-tree runs across the whole chip, optimizing the design for SI, is essential route the clock with double-pitch and triple spacing. 
In-case of SI violation, spacing the signal nets reduces cross-talk impacts. 
Shield the nets with power-nets for high frequency signal nets to prevent from SI. 
Enable SI aware routing , so that the tool takes care for SI 
Ensure SI enabled STA runs, and guarantee the design meeting the SI requirements 
Route signals on different layers orthogonal to each other 
Minimize the parallel run-length wires, by inserting buffers.

&lt;u&gt;Designing for Better Yield(DFY/DFM)&lt;/u&gt;
Better yield could be achieved by reducing the possibility of manufacturability flaws. Guaranteeing the circuit performance, by reducing parametric yield, with process variations playing a major role is a big-challenge.

Create more powerful stringent runset files with pessimistic spacing/short rules. 
Check for the areas where the design is prone to lithographic issues, like sharp cuts and try to re-route it. 
For via-reliability issues, use redundant vias, to reduce the chances for via-breakage. 
In order to design for yield-enhancement , design systems, which could have optimal redundancy, like repairable memories. 
Optimal placing of decoupling capacitances, reduces the power-surges. 
Doubling the width of the non-critical nets, clock-nets can increase the yield parameter. 
Ensure that the poly-orientation are maintained.

&lt;u&gt;Designing for Optimal integration of Analog and Digital&lt;/u&gt; 
As today's IC has analog components also inbuilt , some design practices are required for optimal integration. 
Ensure in the floorplanning stage that the analog block and the digital block are not siting close-by, to reduce the noise. 
Ensure that there exists separate ground for digital and analog ground to reduce the noise. 
Place appropriate guard-rings around the analog-macro's. 
Incorporating in-built DAC-ADC converters, allows us to test the analog portion using digital testers in an analog loop-back fashion. 
Perform techniques like clock-dithering for the digital portion.

&lt;u&gt;Designing for Engineering Change Order&lt;/u&gt;
As more and more complex the IC design is , and with lot of first time application , is more prone to last minute changes, there should be provision in the design-flow to accommodate the functional and timing bugs. The step to perform this called as Engineering change order(ECO).

Ensure that the design has spare functional gates well distributed across the layout. 
Ensure that the selection the spare gates, has many flavours of gates and universal gates, so that any functionality could be achieved.

&lt;u&gt;Designing an Lithography friendly Design&lt;/u&gt;
Designing for Manufacturability requires validating the design full-filling lithography rules

Checking the layout confirming the design rules (spacing,trace-width,shorts). 
Check for the less-congested areas and increasing the spacing of the nets.

'''Noise Simulation:'''

How Noisy is my design so need to perform noise simulations addressing these areas

Analog Noise 
Substrate noise
Power Simulations:

When a digital logic gate switches, it pulls a surge of current through the power and ground pins connected to it.
The inductance of those pins (and their bond wires) converts that surge to an internal drop in supply voltage and rise in ground voltage on-chip (relative to a PCB ground plane).
Those voltage fluctuations may not be enough to interfere with digital logic, but they can seriously interfere with the performance of analog circuits.
There are several &quot;tricks&quot; to reduce the electromagnetic interference (EMI) of these surges.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.circuitcellar.com/library/print/0902/rodgers/index.htm &quot;Killing the EMI Demon&quot;]
by Norman Rogers 2002
&lt;/ref&gt;
* An independent set of &quot;I/O&quot; power supply pins that is only connected to the output drivers on the I/O pads, separate from the &quot;core&quot; power supply pins that power internal digital logic. This helps prevent switching noise in a processor core from leaking out through the output pins, radiating off PCB traces like an antenna, and interfering with radio and television (and failing FCC testing).
* An independent set of &quot;analog&quot; power supply pins that power the on-chip analog components (ADC, DAC, etc.) and analog output pads, separate from the &quot;digital&quot; power supply pins. This helps prevent switching noise in a processor core from interfering with the analog components.
* I/O bus pins (address and data) that only toggle on I/O bus cycles, independent from memory bus pins. A single common bus for all external memory and I/O devices forces each memory access to toggle address and data lines all over the PCB connected to every I/O device, radiating much more noise.
* spread spectrum clock
* internal clock doubler or more general clock PLL -- this allows internal processor core to run at a high clock rate, without that high frequency being directly connected to any PCB traces.
* Put some internal memory on-chip; clock only internal memory (cache RAM or flash memory) at high speeds; use a slower pace to read and write external memory devices.
* Drive output pins with slower rise and fall times to reduce radiated EMI (even though the pins still have the same number of transitions/second); tolerate slower rise and fall times on input pins.
* Prefer differential communication buses -- FireWire, USB, XDR DRAM, low-voltage differential signaling, etc. -- rather than inherently noisier single-ended buses -- RS-232, IEEE 1284, the ISA bus, etc.

'''Thermal Simulations'''

Study the thermal targets and mechanism to reduce thermal problems.

The largest and most obvious thermal problem is permanent failure caused by overheating.
One way to avoid that is ...

There are also more subtle problems, such as thermal gradients causing nonlinearity in analog chips.
Computer simulations often leave out such subtle effects, creating a &quot;simulations never fail&quot; problem when the actual chip performs much worse than the simulations.
Mask Designers carefully lay out amplifiers, placing critical components with symmetry and common-centroid layouts, in order to reject thermal gradients.&lt;ref&gt;

:I changed it to &quot;subject danger.&quot; Can we agree that this is suitable?--[[User:Nugger|Nugger]] 03:13, 3 August 2007 (UTC)

::I can't agree to that and i've reverted, because it is not just the subject who is dangerous.  What about the person who may have inflicted the injuries on them?  I don't see the issue with the word people, it's a basic descriptive, with very few synonyms. [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 06:56, 3 August 2007 (UTC)

:::There are Victims (Those who need help), Suspects (Those who may have caused the injury), and Witnesses (Those who saw what took place, including medical personnel). Subjects are a generalization of everyone at the scene. It's used in report writing here in the states.--[[User:Nugger|Nugger]] 02:43, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

::::It does in that case cause confusion as the common understanding in the UK would be that subject is either the person you're treating (as this is a first aid manual).  In law enforcement subject would be the same as suspect in most useage.  If everyone is that keen on changing from people (and i still don't see why) we need to find an internationally agreeable term.  Regards [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 10:02, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

=== Pie Chart ===

Pie charts are best used to compare parts to the whole by percentages. By measuring the number of '''degrees''' that a piece of the pie chart is, one can find the percentage it represents.

{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;math&gt;\mbox{degrees} = \mbox{percent} \cdot\frac{360}{100}&lt;/math&gt;
{{TrigBoxClose}}

which simplifies to degrees * 18 / 5

=== Bar Chart ===

Bar charts are best for plotting the change in something over a period of time. It is nearly the same as a line chart, except that the points are not connected, and instead extend to the bottom of the chart.</text>

In this section we mainly set up some useful notation.  While the ideas here are not very central to the study of algebra, they do come up from time to time, so pay attention!  It is exactly because these ideas don't reoccur on every page that they can be confusing when they suddenly come up later on.  So be prepared to revisit this section as necessary to refresh your memory.

==Sets and the Number Line==

A '''set''' is a collection of things.  Examples might be the set of letters used in the English alphabet, or the set of books written by John Steinbeck.  For us, the sets we will discuss will usually be collections of numbers because these are the sets that are important in algebra.    Each of the things in a set is called an '''element''' of the set.  The number of elements in a set could be finite or could be infinite.  The only requirement is that the elements of a set should be described explicitly in some way either now or in the future (after we solve some problem).  There may be no elements in a set; such a set is called an '''empty set''' or a '''null set'''.  
In this book we will mostly try to use capital letters as the symbols for sets whereas lower case letters are often (but not always!) used for variables.  

A set can be written by putting braces, that is { and },  around a list of the elements of the set, with each element being separated by a comma.  For example, a set ''S'' containing natural or whole numbers from 1 to 10 could be shown as follows:  

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;S=\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

It is not always possible to list out all the numbers in a set.  In these cases we rely on English to describe the set.  That's right! Words are an important part of math too.  The last and probably most common notation involves using variables and algebraic expressions, together with a description of what values the variables may take.  For example, to describe the set of numbers that are a perfect square, we might write:
:&lt;math&gt;\{n^2 \mid n \text{ is a whole number.}\}&lt;/math&gt; 
or we can even use other sets in the description like:
:&lt;math&gt;\Big\{n^2 \mid n\in \{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}\Big\}&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes we want to explicitly make clear that a particular number (or thing) is in a set.  Keeping ''S'' from the example above, we know that 2 is an element of ''S'', rather than writing this out in English, sometimes people use the shorthand {{nowrap| 2 &amp;isin; S}}.  The symbol &amp;isin; is chosen because it looks like an E, and E is the first letter of the word &quot;element&quot;.  If we want to express that something is not part of a set we use the symbol &amp;notin;.  So to continue our example we know that {{nowrap| 11 &amp;notin; ''S''}}.  

Let's take a look at a practice problem.
{{TextBox|1=
'''Problem.''' For each of the following sets decide if 7 is in the set:
# A={1, 2, 3, 5}
# The set ''O'' of odd numbers.
# ''C''={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …, 100}
# The set ''P'' of all prime numbers. 

'''Answer.'''
# We can see by inspection that 7 &amp;notin; A.
# 7 &amp;isin; ''O'' because ''7'' is an odd number.
# 7 &amp;isin; ''C''.  This is a bit of a trick question.  While it hasn't been explicitly said it yet, when listing elements people sometimes use … to mean keep &quot;following the pattern&quot;.  And in the rest of mathematics … keeps getting used in this way, so it is time to get used to it.  Here the pattern is we start with 1 and keep making the numbers 1 bigger, so yes, if we keep going we will reach 7.
# 7 &amp;isin; ''P''.  This problem requires that we try to factor 7, or have previously known it was a prime number.  Since 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 all leave a remainder when we divide 7 by them, we see that 7 is a prime number.
}}

We now introduce the basic ideas that come up when you have two or more sets.

==Subsets and Super sets==
Sometimes every element in one set is contained in another set.  For example, let {{nowrap|1= ''S'' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} }} and {{nowrap|1= ''T'' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} }}.  Clearly ''T'' is just the even numbers between 1 and 10, and every number in ''T'' is already in ''S''.  In this example we would say that ''T'' is a '''subset''' of ''S''.  Instead of saying which set is the smaller one, we could instead say which set is the bigger one by calling it a '''superset'''.  That is, we could say ''S'' is a superset of ''T''.  As one deals with sets more and more, it becomes increasingly tempting to say that ''T'' is ''smaller than'' ''S'' (or maybe ''less than'' ''S'').  In fact, we already have!  Because the relationship of one set being contained in another is so similar to relationship of one number being less than another it is natural to introduce a symbol very similar to inequality symbol &lt;. To avoid confusing sets with numbers we don't want to use exactly the same symbol, so we will round out the point a bit and use the symbol &amp;sub;. So instead of writing out in words &quot;''T'' is a subset of ''S''&quot;, we could write {{nowrap| ''T'' &amp;sube; ''S''}}.  Just like inequality we can flip the symbol around.  We just have to make sure the rounded side points to the smaller thing.  That is, for our example we could write {{nowrap|''S'' &amp;sup; ''T''}}.  

What if two sets have exactly the same elements?  In this case we say that the two sets are '''equal'''.  So if someone else came along and said let {{nowrap|1= ''U'' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} }}, then we say that ''S'' and ''U'' are equal.  This time we don't worry about confusing sets and numbers and we will stick with the symbol = to denote when two sets are equal.  So we can write {{nowrap|1= ''S'' = ''T''}}.  Are there relationships corresponding to &amp;le; and &amp;ge;?  Yes, the are &amp;sube; and &amp;supe; and they work like you might expect.  Here is a table that explains how each of these symbols work.
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
!Expression
!Meaning
|-
|''T'' &amp;sub; ''S''
| Means ''T'' is a subset of ''S''. That is every element of ''T'' is an element in ''S'', but there is some element of ''S'' that is not in ''T''.
|-
|''T'' &amp;sup; ''S''
|Means ''S'' is a subset of ''T''. That is, every element of ''S'' is an element in ''T'', but there is some element of ''T'' that is not in ''S''.
|-
|''S'' = ''T''
|Means that ''S'' and ''T'' have exactly the same elements.  That is, use a few more words every element of ''S'' is an element of ''T'' '''and''' every element of ''T'' is an element of ''S''.
|-
|''T'' &amp;sube; ''S''
|Means every element of ''T'' is an element of ''S''.  (Notice that saying it this way allows for the possibility that ''S'' = ''T'') 
|-
|''S'' &amp;supe; ''T''
| Means every element of ''T'' is an element of ''S''.
|}

==Unions and Intersections==
There are two other things to do with sets.  Given sets in ''S'' and ''T'' we may want to talk about all the elements that are in either ''S'' or ''T''.  Since a set is just a collection of things, and &quot;the elements that are in either ''S'' or ''T''&quot; is a collection, you can think of this as defining a new set called the '''union''' of ''S'' and ''T''.  We write the union of ''S'' and ''T'' by  {{nowrap|''S'' &amp;cup; ''T''}}. We use the symbol &amp;cup; because it looks like a u, and u is the first letter in word &quot;union&quot;.  Let's do an example.
{{TextBox|1= 
'''Problem.''' Suppose {{nowrap|1= ''S'' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} }} and {{nowrap|1= ''T'' = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15} }}, Find {{nowrap|1= ''S'' &amp;cup; ''T''}}.

'''Answer.''' {{nowrap|1= ''S'' &amp;cup; ''T'' = {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15} }}
}}
An important thing to notice in this example is that {{nowrap|''S'' &amp;cup; ''T''}} doesn't contain two 6's.  The union contains all the elements in either set, but 6 is still just ''one thing'' that happens to be in both sets.

Give sets ''S'' and ''T'', instead of thinking about things that are in either set, it is sometimes handy to think about things that are in ''both'' sets.  Again we think of the collection of &quot;the elements in both ''S'' and ''T'', this set is called the '''intersection''' of ''S'' and ''T''.  We write the intersection of ''S'' and ''T'' by {{nowrap|''S'' &amp;cap; ''T''}}.  We don't use the symbol &amp;cap; because it looks like an i.  It doesn't. Somehow, an i between two symbols just wouldn't look as good, so we want to pick something else.  This symbol is just the upside down symbol of the symbol for union.  Let's consider what the intersection looks like in the problem above.
{{TextBox|1= 
'''Problem.''' Suppose {{nowrap|1= ''S'' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} }} and {{nowrap|1= ''T'' = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15} }}, Find {{nowrap|1= ''S'' &amp;cap; ''T''}}.

'''Answer.''' {{nowrap|1= ''S'' &amp;cap; ''T'' = {6} }}
}}
The number 6 is the only number in both sets, so it is the only element of the intersection.

==Subsets of the Real numbers==
In this section, we give names to some of the important classes of number. 

The first important set of numbers is probably the first set of numbers we are really introduced to, namely the '''Natural Numbers''', which we will call &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.  The natural numbers are:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}=\{1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;. 

The next set is just a little bigger, and includes the next number we usually learn in elementary school. The natural numbers, together with the number 0 will be called the '''Whole Numbers''', and denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{W}&lt;/math&gt;. The whole numbers are:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{W}=\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Of course we are missing the negative numbers.  The set of whole numbers together with all of the negative numbers is called the ''Integers'' denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.  (You might ask why a letter that looks like Z.  The reason is because it comes from the German word for number, Zahlen.  English speakers are not the only ones to make important contributions to mathematics! Today, Z is the letter used almost universally.)  The integers are:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}=\{\ldots, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Next, as you might guess we need a set of numbers that includes fractions.  The set of all numbers that can be written as a fraction is written is called the '''Rational Numbers''' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.  You might ask why a letter that looks like Q?  Well, first mathematicians save the letter R for real numbers (described below) and F for a general number field (a concept a bit beyond this book).  But since a quotient is another word for fraction, and we are not using Q for anything else, it seems the sensible choice. The rational numbers are:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}=\left\{\frac{a}{b} \,\Big|\, a,b\in\mathbb{Z} \text{ and } b\neq 0 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

What about just the decimal numbers, we spent a long time working with them.  As mentioned in the section on [[Algebra/Variables|variables]] the set of all numbers decimal numbers (including those whose that continue indefinitely after the decimal point) is known as the '''Real Numbers''' and is written with the symbol &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case we will not attempt to give a formula that describes the set, and instead just rely on its English description.  But we should give a few examples of real numbers.   

It may seem difficult to believe, but not every number can be written has a fraction.  As we will see later, one such number is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}=1.41421356237\ldots&lt;/math&gt;, but this is far from the only example.  Indeed every integer can be written as a decimal just by adding a decimal point and infinitely many zeros to it. For example, {{nowrap|1= 0 = 0.000…}} and {{nowrap|1= -3 = -3.000… }} and we have made those to integers into decimal numbers.  What about fractions?  Yes every fraction can be written as a decimal simply using long division.  We can also add, subtract, multiply and divide any two real numbers to get another real number (as long as we don't divide by 0). Unfortunately it gets to be very difficult to describe why this is.  The algorithms we learn in school for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing real numbers all being with the decimal place furthest to the right.  If the decimal goes on forever, it is awfully hard to find the decimal furthest to the right.  So what do we do?  For the moment the answer has to be &quot;not worry about it too much&quot;.  Later, after we have mastered a few more mathematics courses we will be ready to tackle the task of making sense of the arithmetic of real numbers.  In the mean time your intuition about decimal numbers will probably not lead you astray.  And where ever possible we will stick to fractions, or expressions like &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, rather than having to deal with infinitely long decimals.

Notice, the above list of numbers is increasing.  That is, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}\subset \mathbb{W}\subset \mathbb{Z}\subset \mathbb{Q}\subset\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  

There is one last set of numbers it we should name.  The '''Irrational Numbers''' is the set of all real numbers which are '''not''' rational numbers, we shall denote this set by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt;, though other books may choose other names.  To give a formula, we write:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{I}=\{x\in\R \mid x\not\in\mathbb{Q}\}.&lt;/math&gt; 

We have never quite given the definition of a set this way. We added emphasis that the numbers ''x'' needed to come from the set of real numbers.  This is also a common way to denote a set, though we may not use it much.  We should point out there are numbers that are irrational.  The most famous example is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, but there are many many more.  In fact the square root of any number which is not a perfect square will be an irrational number.  As will the cube root of anything which isn't a perfect cube, etc. 

We should point out that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}=\mathbb{Q}\cup\mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt;
Why? Well because of the definition of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt;.  Maybe your thinking &quot;wait, what does this mean again?&quot;  Remember that two sets are equal if they have the same elements.  So we really should explain why everything in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}\cup\mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; '''and''' why everything in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}\cup\mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt;.  But we will leave this as an exercise to the ambitious reader.

=== Practice Problems ===

Name the ''smallest'' of the sets given above to which the following numbers belong to.

#0
#&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{21} \,&lt;/math&gt;
#0.0110211
#&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{49}&lt;/math&gt;
#-32
#&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Answers ===

# The number 0 is a whole number, that is it is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{W}&lt;/math&gt;. It cannot be in any smaller set that we named because it is not in the natural numbers.
# The number 21 is not a pefect square, so &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{21}&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt;.
# The decimal expansion ends, meaning it can be represented as fraction, specifically 110,211/10,000,000, so it is a rational number.  That is 0.0110211 &amp;isin; &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; of two integers - a rational number thus also a real number.
# The square root of ''49'' is ''7'', which is a natural number.
# Since -32 is a negative number the smallest set it could be in is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} &lt;/math&gt; it is an integer, the integers.
# Notice, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}}=\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, so this number is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, the rational numbers.</text>

Probability is the chance that something will occur. For example, what are the chances that two dice rolled will equal 7? To solve this, a chart can be made of all the pairs of the integers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} that add up to 7.

* 1 + 6
* 2 + 5
* 3 + 4
* 4 + 3
* 5 + 2
* 6 + 1

note that the first three seem to be the same as the second three. This is because there are two dice, so when the first die gets number X and the second gets Y, it's a different outcome than the first being Y and the second X.

Next, we find out how many possibilities there are in total.

6 possibilities for the first die * 6 possibilities for the second = 36 combinations.

Since 6 out of the 36 combinations add up to 7, the answer is 1/6 or 16.6666666...% or 0.166666666... Usually, probabilities are measured in the first or second way.

===Ratios===

Quite often, ratios are used to show the probability of an event occurring compared to another event. Be careful! The ratio of heads to tails is 1:1 or 1/1, but the probability of heads is 1:2 or 1/2. Don't confuse these two ways of writing the same thing.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi,

Thanks for your comments on the Haskell wikibook.  I haven't had the time (attentional cycles?) to look at them in detail, but perhaps you might consider sharing them with the wikibook list (wikibook at haskell dot org), where other people might react usefully to them.  Or this being a wiki, just be bold and do what you think is right.  The worst that could happen is a revert. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 04:01, 1 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Indenting and Line Length==

Use an indent of one tab (no spaces! good IDEs can convert this to pseudo spaces - 2 or 4 etc). If you use Emacs to edit your code,
you should set indent-tabs-mode to nil.  It  is  recommended  that  you  break
lines  at  approximately  75-85 characters.  There  is  no  standard  rule for 
the best way to break a line; use your judgement.  This applies to all file
types: PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.

Indentation rules should be applied in the source file that will be edited
by others.  The visual appeal of HTML output should not be taken into
consideration when writing code that generates HTML.

==HTML Standards==

===Validation===

As of September 2006, the DocType on our documents will be XHTML 1.0
Transitional.  Therefore, compliant HTML according to the XHTML 1.0 standard
should be used at all times.  Exceptions should be just that.  A good
reference for the XHTML elements can be found at 
[http://www.devguru.com/Technologies/xhtml/quickref/xhtml_index.html DevGuru].

Also, to ensure that the box model is done correctly by IE 6, we must use the following DocType on all pages.  Only this doc type is to be used.  No other information should be placed before it.

{{Code:Basic|Example DocType|
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

===Element Usage===

When at all possible, try and use standard HTML elements properly.  &quot;Div Soup&quot;
should be avoided at all times.  &quot;Div Soup&quot; refers to HTML where a div (or span)
is used when it is not needed.  For example, if you need a word to be bolded,
do not use a &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tag and apply a style.  Instead, use the 
&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tag.

Tables should be used only when data needs to be displayed in columns.  One
cell tables should never be used. 

One common exception is needing to use &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tags in place of
&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tags when the contents of the tag will be other block level
elements such as &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.

{{Code:Basic|Example HTML|
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;this is the headline&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the body with an &lt;strong&gt;important word&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;small&gt;Posted 2 days ago&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

==CSS Standards==

'''Inline styles should be avoided'''

Styles in CSS files should be as specific as possible.  One should always try
to avoid using a bare class name.  If you are styling an object that has a
container, your style should reference the continer as well as the element
being styled. The more verbose your styles in your CSS the less likely you
will mess up another element on another page accidentally.

The most efficient way to style an element is by styling that type of element
inside a container.  If only one element needs to be styled in a special way,
it should be assigned and id and styled using the id and preferably a container.


Here is some HTML from our sidebar:

{{Code:Basic|Example Article HTML|

    &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

And here is a small bit of how we style those elements.

{{Code:Basic|Example CSS|

This verbosity ensures that other elements are not accidentially styled.

==Javascript Syntax==

See PHP Syntax Below.  The languages are similar enough that the same rules should apply 
in most cases.

==PHP Syntax==

===Request Vars===

Although our servers currently have register_globals enabled, PHP6 will remove this option.  Therefore, in new code, you should always use the super globals $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE.  $_REQUEST should be used only when it is known for sure that a variable could be supplied using multiple methods. 

===PHP &amp; HTML===

No &quot;template system&quot; such as Smarty will be used.  PHP itself is a templating language.
A best effort should be made to arrange your code by putting logic at the top of file 
and output at the bottom of the file.  Sometimes that will require looping the same
information twice.  However, this will make the code much more maintainable.

{{Code:Basic|Example PHP/HTML Mix|
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;?php

$sql = &quot;select * from publications&quot;;
$PHEWSDB-&amp;gt;query($sql);
while($rec = $PHEWSDB-&amp;gt;fetch_array()){
    $publications[] = $rec;
}

?&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;label&amp;gt;Publications&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;?php foreach($publications as $pub) { ?&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;?=$pub[&quot;name&quot;]?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;?php } ?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
}}


===Control Structures===

These include &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;switch&lt;/tt&gt;, etc. 
{{Code:Basic|Example &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; statement|
&lt;pre&gt;
if (condition1 || condition2) {
    action1;
} elseif (condition3 &amp;&amp; (condition4 || condition5)) {
    action2;
} else {
    defaultaction;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

Control statements should have one space between the control keyword
and opening parenthesis, to distinguish them from function calls.

You  are  strongly  encouraged  to  always  use  curly  braces even in
situations  where they are technically optional. Having them increases
readability  and  decreases  the  likelihood  of  logic  errors  being
introduced when new lines are added.
{{Code:Basic|Example &lt;tt&gt;switch&lt;/tt&gt; statement|
&lt;pre&gt;
switch (condition) {
    case 1:
        action1;
        break;
    case 2:
        action2;
        break;
    
    default:
        defaultaction;
        break;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

===Function Calls===

Functions should be called with no spaces between the function name, the
opening parenthesis, and the first parameter; spaces between commas and each
parameter, and no space between the last parameter, the closing parenthesis,
and the semicolon.
{{Code:Basic|Example function call|
&lt;pre&gt;
$var = foo($bar, $baz, $quux);
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

As  displayed  above,  there  should be one space on either side of an
equals  sign  used  to  assign  the  return  value  of a function to a
variable.  In  the  case of a block of related assignments, more space
may be inserted to promote readability:
{{Code:Basic||
&lt;pre&gt;
$short         = foo($bar);
$long_variable = foo($baz);
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

===Function Definitions===

Function declarations are similar to function calls with the beginning brace
on the same line as the function declaration.
{{Code:Basic|Example &lt;tt&gt;function&lt;/tt&gt; definition|
&lt;pre&gt;
function foo_func($arg1, $arg2 = '') {
    if (condition) {
        statement;
    }
    return $val;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

Arguments  with  default  values  go  at the end of the argument list.
Always  attempt to return a meaningful value from a function if one is
appropriate.
{{Code:Basic|Longer &lt;tt&gt;function&lt;/tt&gt; example|
&lt;pre&gt;
function connect(&amp;$dsn, $persistent = false) {
    if (is_array($dsn)) {
        $dsninfo = &amp;$dsn;
    } else {
        $dsninfo = DB::parseDSN($dsn);
    }

    if (!$dsninfo || !$dsninfo['phptype']) {
        return $this-&gt;raiseError();
    }

    return true;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;}}


===Comments===

Complete inline documentation comment blocks (docblocks) must be provided.
Please read the [[#Sample File|Sample File]] and [[#Header Comment Blocks|Header Comment Blocks]]
sections to learn the specifics of writing docblocks for PHP.
Further information can be found on the 
[http://www.phpdoc.org/ phpDocumentor] website.

Non-documentation comments are strongly encouraged. A general rule of thumb
is that if you look at a section of code and think &quot;Wow, I don't want to try
and describe that&quot;, you need to comment it before you forget how it works.

C style comments (&lt;tt&gt;/* */&lt;/tt&gt;) and standard C++ comments (&lt;tt&gt;//&lt;/tt&gt;) are both fine. The use
of Perl / shell style comments (&lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt;) is ''strongly'' discouraged.


===Including Code===

Anywhere you are unconditionally including a class file, use &lt;tt&gt;require_once&lt;/tt&gt;.
Anywhere you are conditionally including a class file, use &lt;tt&gt;include_once&lt;/TT&gt;.
Either of these will ensure that class files are included only once.
They share the same file list, so you don't need to
worry about mixing them - a file included with &lt;tt&gt;require_once&lt;/tt&gt; will not be
included again by &lt;tt&gt;include_once&lt;/tt&gt;.

{{Note|include_once and require_once are statements, not functions.
Parentheses should not surround the subject filename.}}

===PHP Code Tags===

Always use &lt;tt&gt;&lt;?php ?&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to delimit PHP code, not the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;? ?&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; shorthand. This is
the most portable way to include PHP code on different operating systems and server setups.


===Header Comment Blocks===

All source code files shall contain a &quot;page-level&quot;
docblock at the top of each file and a &quot;class-level&quot; docblock immediately
above each class or function.
{{Code:Basic|Example docblocks|
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;?php

/**

 *
 * Long description for file (if any)...
 *
 * @category   CategoryName
 * @package    PackageName

}

?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;}}


====Required Tags That Have Variable Content====

=====Short Descriptions=====

Short descriptions must be provided for all docblocks. They
should be a quick sentence, not the name of the item. Please
read the Coding Standard's Sample File about how to write good
descriptions.

=====@author=====

There's no hard rule to determine when a new code contributor
should be added to the list of authors for a given source file.
In general, their changes should fall into the &quot;substantial&quot;
category (meaning somewhere around 10% to 20% of code changes).
Exceptions could be made for rewriting functions or
contributing new logic.

Simple code reorganization or bug fixes would not justify the
addition of a new individual to the list of authors.

=====@since=====

This tag is required when a file or class is added after the
package's initial release. Do not use it in an initial release.

=====@deprecated=====

This tag is required when a file or class is no longer used but
has been left in place for backwards compatibility.

====Order and Spacing====

To ease long term readability of the source code, the text and tags must
conform to the order and spacing provided in the example above. This
standard is adopted from the JavaDoc standard.


===Example URLs===

Use example.com, example.org and example.net for all example URLs and email
addresses, per RFC 2606.


===Naming Conventions===

====Classes====

Classes should be given descriptive names. Avoid using abbreviations where
possible. Class names should always begin with an uppercase letter and use mixed case to seperate ''words''.

Examples of good class names are:

&lt;pre&gt;
Log
NetFinger
HTMLUploadError
&lt;/pre&gt;

====Functions, Methods and Variable Names====

Functions, methods and variable names should be named using the Unix C style.
If applicable, functions should have the package or library name as a prefix 
to avoid name collisions. Names should be all lowercase with
each new &quot;word&quot; seperated by an underscore(&lt;tt&gt;_&lt;/tt&gt;). Some Examples:

&lt;pre&gt;
connect() 
get_data()
build_some_widget()

$i
$count
$temp_array
&lt;/pre&gt;

Private  class  members (meaning class members that are intended to be
used  only  from within the same class in which they are declared are
preceded by a single underscore. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
_sort()
_init_tree()
$this-&gt;_status
&lt;/pre&gt;

====Constants and Global Variables====

Constants and global variables should always be all-uppercase, with underscores to separate
words. Prefix constant names with the uppercased name of the class/package
they are used in. For example, the constants used by a package named &lt;tt&gt;DB&lt;/tt&gt;
begin with &lt;tt&gt;DB_&lt;/tt&gt;.

 Note: The true, false and null constants are excepted from the 
 all-uppercase rule, and must always be lowercase.

===File Formats===

All scripts must:

* Be stored as ASCII text
* Use ISO-8859-1 character encoding
* Be Unix formatted, which means:
*# Lines must end only with a line feed (LF). Line feeds are represented as ordinal 10, octal 012 and hex 0A. Do not use carriage returns (CR) like Macintosh computers do or the carriage return/line feed combination (CRLF) like Windows computers do.
*# It is recommended that the last character in the file is a line feed.  This means that when the cursor is at the very end of the file, it should be one line below the last line of text.  Some utilities, such as diff, will complain if the last character in the file is not a line feed.

===Sample File===

Each docblock in the example contains many details about writing Docblock
Comments. Following those instructions is important for two reasons. First,
when docblocks are easy to read, users and developers can quickly ascertain
what your code does. 

Please take note of the vertical and horizontal spacing. They are part of
the standard.

 * phpDocumentor documentation for more information.
 * http://phpdoc.org/docs/HTMLSmartyConverter/default/phpDocumentor/tutorial_phpDocumentor.howto.pkg.html
 *
 * The Javadoc Style Guide is an excellent resource for figuring out

 * cases where what's said here overrides what is said there.
 * http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html#styleguide
 *
 * The first line of any docblock is the summary.  Make them one short
 * sentence, without a period at the end.  Summaries for classes, properties
 * and constants should omit the subject and simply state the object,
 * because they are describing things rather than actions or behaviors.

     *
     * Summaries should add description beyond the method's name. The
     * best method names are &quot;self-documenting&quot;, meaning they tell you
     * basically what the method does.  If the summary merely repeats
     * the method name in sentence form, it is not providing more
     * information.
     *
     * Summary Examples:
     *   + Sets the label              (preferred)
     *   + Set the label               (avoid)
     *   + This method sets the label  (avoid)
     *
     * Below are the tags commonly used for methods.  A @param tag is
     * required for each parameter the method has.  The @return and
     * @access tags are mandatory.  The @throws tag is required if the
     * method uses exceptions.  @static is required if the method can
     * be called statically.  The remainder should only be used when
     * necessary.  Please use them in the order they appear here.
     * phpDocumentor has several other tags available, feel free to use
     * them.
     *
     * The @param tag contains the data type, then the parameter's
     * name, followed by a description.  By convention, the first noun in
     * the description is the data type of the parameter.  Articles like
     * &quot;a&quot;, &quot;an&quot;, and  &quot;the&quot; can precede the noun.  The descriptions
     * should start with a phrase.  If further description is necessary,
     * follow with sentences.  Having two spaces between the name and the
     * description aids readability.
     *
     * When writing a phrase, do not capitalize and do not end with a
     * period:
     *   + the string to be tested
     *
     * When writing a phrase followed by a sentence, do not capitalize the
     * phrase, but end it with a period to distinguish it from the start
     * of the next sentence:
     *   + the string to be tested. Must use UTF-8 encoding.
     *
     * Return tags should contain the data type then a description of
     * the data returned.  The data type can be any of PHP's data types
     * (int, float, bool, string, array, object, resource, mixed)
     * and should contain the type primarily returned.  For example, if
     * a method returns an object when things work correctly but false
     * when an error happens, say 'object' rather than 'mixed.'  Use
     * 'void' if nothing is returned.
     *
     * Here's an example of how to format examples:
     * &lt;sample&gt;
     * require_once 'Net/Sample.php';
     *
     * $s = new Net_Sample();
     * if (PEAR::isError($s)) {
     *     echo $s-&gt;getMessage() . &quot;\n&quot;;
     * }
     * &lt;/sample&gt;
     *
     * @param string $arg1  the string to quote
     * @param int    $arg2  an integer of how many problems happened.
     *                       Indent to the description's starting point
     *                       for long ones.
     *
     * @return int  the integer of the set mode used. FALSE if foo
     *               foo could not be set.
     * @throws exceptionclass  [description]

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]] remains unattached for the first three years of the series. It seems that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] is attracted to her when he arrives for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], but she does not reciprocate his feelings; she sees him as a pen-friend, though it is obvious to us that he wants more than that. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s relationship with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]] ends, he suddenly discovers his true feelings for Hermione, feelings which Hermione has quietly had for him for the past three years or more; and by the end of the sixth book, they have become more than &quot;sort of&quot; together, according to Harry. They remain so, with some friction, throughout the seventh book.

== Event Details ==

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosophers' Stone]] ===

Hermione starts off this book as a smart, but very bossy and largely unattractive girl with rather large teeth. She is written as a &quot;grind&quot;, the sort of person who is obsessed with rules and marks, and is quite unappealing. After Hallowe'en, however, she becomes friends with Harry and Ron, and later takes part in protecting the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]], helping Harry to bypass the many obstacles leading to where it is being guarded.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Hermione develops a rapid crush on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]], Hogwarts' new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] instructor, resulting in possibly a bit more than an annoyed flicker from Ron. While she never develops an attachment for Lockhart, she, along with many other girls in the school, seems entranced by him. Despite some clear evidence that his magical competence is limited, Hermione asks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Irma Pince|Madam Pince]] if she can keep the note Lockhart wrote giving her permission to check out a restricted library book. It is only as the year continues, and Lockhart's competence is repeatedly challenged and found wanting, that Hermione finally loses interest in him.

Towards year's end, Hermione is attacked and petrified by the Monster that has been released from the Chamber of Secrets. When we see her in the Hospital Wing, Ron seems more deeply affected than Harry.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Hermione is somehow managing to take twelve subjects during most of this book, though it drops to eleven after she gives up on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Divination|Divination]] in mid-April. She is far too busy, even with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Time-Turner|Time-turner]] to assist with her scheduling, to have much of a social life, and when we see her she is tired from overwork and snappish. When Hermione suggests to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], at Christmas, that Harry's new broom might be jinxed, this causes an estrangement between Hermione and the other two. During this time, Hermione is working to try and secure a reprieve for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak]], a job that Harry and Ron promised to help with, but have somehow forgotten.

The return of Harry's broom could have cured this separation, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Ron's pet rat, Scabbers]] immediately disappears, apparently eaten by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Crookshanks|Hermione's pet cat Crookshanks]], leaving Ron estranged from Hermione. We learn from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] that she is feeling this separation very deeply &amp;ndash; she is often in tears when she visits him. The two of them do reconcile when they have to start work on Buckbeak's final appeal, but they remain at least outwardly friends, rather than anything more serious.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Ron is apparently infatuated with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]], a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]] student and shortly the Beauxbatons Champion in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], much to Hermione's disgust. When Fleur comes over to the Gryffindor table to ask if they want their bouillabaisse, Ron is almost struck dumb. After she departs, Ron says that she must have some [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veela|Veela]] in her ancestry. Hermione is rather nettled by this, and says that nobody else is acting that silly about her, but Harry notices that many other students seem similarly struck by her.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]], who arrived with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]] delegation, and has been chosen as their Champion in the Tournament, seems to appear in the library whenever Hermione is there.

It is early in this term that the abortive duel between Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] results in Hermione's already big teeth being dramatically over-enlarged by a stray curse. In the Hospital Wing, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] arranges to shrink them to their original size, but Hermione deliberately has her overdo it, so that they are the correct proportion for her face.

Matters come to a head at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]]. Ron invites Hermione to be his date (apparently as a last resort), but Hermione already has a date - with Viktor Krum, who had haunted the library to get closer to Hermione. After three hours getting ready for the ball, Hermione is almost unrecognizably pretty. Ron glowers at Hermione as she dances with Viktor. When she floats over to speak to Ron and Harry, Ron accuses her of &quot;fraternizing with the enemy&quot;. Hermione angrily stalks off into the crowd, while Ron and Harry exit for a walk in the rose garden.

After the dance, Harry finds Ron and Hermione arguing in the Gryffindor common room. Hermione shouts that if Ron does not like it, then, &quot;The next time there's a Ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!&quot; Hermione storms off, and Ron, stunned, says Hermione is quite clearly missing the point. It is obvious to Harry, and the reader, that Hermione understands the jealousy between them, while Ron quite clearly does not, and will not for some time after.

In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]], the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Merpeople|merpeople]] are holding someone valuable to each Champion deep under the lake. Hermione is the &quot;hostage&quot; that Krum is to rescue. When Harry returns to the surface with Ron and also Gabrielle, Fleur's sister, Hermione and Viktor are close to each other, talking privately; Hermione breaks away from Krum briefly to check on Harry and Ron. Fleur is overjoyed at Gabrielle's rescue and gratefully kisses Harry, and also Ron, because he helped. Hermione is somewhat bothered by Fleur's attention to Ron, but is distracted by Viktor, who is apparently trying to retain Hermione's attention when she talks to Harry and Ron.

Shortly after, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] writes a scurrilous article for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Witch Weekly|''Witch Weekly'']] suggesting Hermione is keeping both Harry and Viktor as lovers. Hermione wonders how Rita knew Viktor had invited her to visit him over the summer; Ron becomes upset at hearing about the invitation.

A month before the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]], after surveying where the task will take place, Krum asks Harry to walk with him. Harry is amazed when Krum asks if Hermione is Harry's girlfriend, and Harry replies she most definitely is not; they are only friends, despite how much Hermione talks about him.

As the Beauxbatons' carriage is about to depart, Fleur bids Harry goodbye. Ron is once again almost completely tongue-tied in her presence, earning a vexed look from Hermione.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Hermione remains largely unattached throughout this book, though it is likely that she is waiting for Ron to do something. It is mentioned that Hermione is writing to Viktor Krum, who Ron pettily persists in calling &quot;Vickie&quot;. Hermione insists that he is only a pen-friend, but Ron darkly says that he would ''like'' to be a lot more than that. Hermione flushes at this comment.

As Ron is leaving breakfast for the Quidditch pitch, on the morning of his first-ever Quidditch match, Hermione kisses him on the cheek. Ron seems bemused by this, rubbing the spot on his cheek as he leaves the Great Hall.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Fleur is living in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Weasley's house]] as she prepares for her wedding to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]]. Ron, still dealing with the remnants of his infatuation with her, has mixed feelings about this development, as he seems to still be hoping for a kiss from her, but is totally abashed when she &quot;jumps out at [him] unexpectedly, like then.&quot; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] are not so pleased; she seems quite self-centered and doesn't seem to care for the feelings of the family very much. Hermione is upset by this as well; it seems that Ron's ongoing goofiness whenever Fleur is around is quite troubling to her.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]] begins the school year openly flirting with Ron, much to Hermione's disgust. After a particularly terrible Quidditch practice, Ron and his sister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] have a row after he and Harry accidentally walk in on her snogging [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]] in a Hogwarts hallway. They have a screaming match in which Ginny accuses Ron of having absolutely no experience with girls. She says that Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho]] have been snogging, as have Hermione and Viktor Krum, and accuses Ron of being jealous because he's the only one (presumably, of the Trio plus Ginny) who doesn't have anyone to snog with. Since Ron is still smarting from watching Hermione being singled out by Krum, and their ongoing pen-pal relationship, he responds to Lavender's advances. Their relationship is publicly and intensely physical – Harry at one point compares it to a vertical wrestling match, and at another point wonders which of several hands he can see belongs to whom. This causes a huge rift between Hermione and Ron that lasts several months during their 6th year. Hermione is somewhere between vexed and incensed at this relationship of Ron's, at one point summoning a flock of birds to attack Ron when he and Lavender barge in on her, evidently looking for a private place to snog.

Hermione, as an exceptional student, has been invited to join the &quot;Slug Club&quot;, a group of students who periodically are asked to parties by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]. Slughorn has made a larger than usual effort for the Christmas party, and Hermione is expected to bring a guest, as is Harry who has also been courted for the Slug Club. Hermione debates with herself, during [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology class]] with Ron and Harry, who she will take to the Slug Club Christmas party. Ron eventually quietly asks if she will take him; she does not answer. Shortly after this, Hermione, in Ron and Lavender's entangled presence, loudly tells [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati Patil]] that she is taking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cormac McLaggen|Cormac McLaggen]] to the Slug Club party, because she likes &quot;good Quidditch players.&quot; This leaves Harry marveling at the lengths to which women would go to get revenge.

This strategy backfires on her, as McLaggen keeps trying to maneuver Hermione under mistletoe at the party. She latches onto Harry once he arrives, as his date, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]], seems to have chosen to spend her time discussing conspiracy theories with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sibyll Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]].

After one of their stretches of estrangement, when Ron's spell-checking quill goes wrong and messes up an essay he is writing, she unbends enough to offer to correct it for him. With a sigh of relief, Ron pushes his essay over to her, saying that he loves her. Hermione blushes, but says only that he shouldn't let Lavender hear that.

On his birthday, Ron eats some chocolate cauldrons which have been spiked with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Love Potion|love potion]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Romilda Vane|Romilda Vane]], who intended them for Harry. After receiving the antidote from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]], Ron is nearly killed by some poison intended for another victim, possibly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]. Hermione, deeply worried, stays by his bedside in the Hospital Wing his entire first day. It is likely significant that the first time Ron speaks after being poisoned, it is immediately after the first time that Hermione, waiting at his bedside, has said something, and that what he says is her name. She visits him frequently until he is fully recovered, and thereafter she and Ron mend their differences.

Harry now determines that he must use [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Felix Felicis|Felix Felicis potion]] to get a memory from Professor Slughorn. Under the influence of this potion, he decides to don his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] and go visit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]. As he, Ron, and Hermione descend from the boy's dormitory, they run into Lavender; she of course can't see Harry, and starts berating Ron for being up in his dormitory &quot;alone with ''her''&quot; (Hermione). This is basically the lever Ron needs to end his relationship with her.

By the close of this book, Ron and Hermione are almost a couple. Between the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Tower Battle (Hogwarts)|battle under the Astronomy tower]] and Dumbledore's funeral, we see what appears to be almost a double date, with apparent intimacy between Ron and Hermione as well as an intimate relationship between Ginny and Harry; and Ron and Hermione sit together at Dumbledore's funeral, where we also see them comforting each other.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Harry finds that Ron has been given a book by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]], ''Twelve Fail-Safe Ways To Charm Witches'', which he describes as &quot;pure gold&quot;. Harry, who has received his own copy from Ron with the strict admonition to keep it secret from Hermione, notes him using the techniques in this book both on his own mother and on Hermione; Hermione seems pleased when Ron compliments her.

Hermione is somewhat shocked when Viktor Krum shows up at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill]] and Fleur's wedding; Fleur has invited him, and Hermione had not expected to see him there. He, in turn, is disgruntled when Ron hauls Hermione away and onto the dance floor; it is obvious at this point that he had in fact been hoping she would be more than a pen-friend. Hermione and Ron are still on the dance floor when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt's]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]] arrives with news of the fall of the Ministry. Fleeing the arriving Death Eaters, the Trio find sanctuary, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place]]. There, as they turn in for the night, Hermione chooses to sleep beside Ron.

As the Trio escape from the Ministry, Ron is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Splinched]], and Hermione is desperate in her efforts to heal him. She seems almost as affected by Ron's injury as Ron is himself.

During their search of the Horcruxes, especially after they retrieve [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Slytherin's]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Locket]] from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Umbridge]], the relationship between the friends is strained. Ron, who is used to having three daily meals and not doing much work, is especially put out by their continued, apparently aimless, peregrinations through the cold, wet British countryside. His feelings are strengthened by the Locket, and, in a moment of rage when Harry admits not having a plan to find the Horcruxes, abandons the quest. His departure leaves Hermione in tears, and while they delay their departure the next morning in the hopes that Ron will return to their camp, eventually they decide that they must leave for the sake of their safety. Knowing that Ron will not be able to find them again, Hermione is devastated, and simply sits, sobbing, at their arrival point, leaving Harry to set the defensive spells around them.

By common unspoken agreement, Harry and Hermione do not discuss Ron's departure. Hermione retreats even further into her books, and Harry does not know how to console her.

When Ron comes back, Hermione explodes with apparent rage, and starts to hit him with all her strength, the first show of irrationality from Hermione. Harry has to separate them with a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Protego|Shield charm]], whereupon Hermione physically seems to retreat into herself. In hopes that Hermione will relent, Harry asks Ron to tell what had happened to him while he was away. She eventually does unwind, though Harry is a little surprised that she seems to not be moved by either Ron's saving Harry, or Ron's conquering the jealousy inspired by the Horcrux in its efforts to preserve itself. Rather, it is Ron's detailing his attempt to return, and his finding Harry and Hermione by means of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deluminator|Deluminator]], that cause her to relax a little. However, relations between the two are very strained for the next while.

When the Trio are captured and taken to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]], Hermione is kept apart from the others by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], who is torturing her in order to determine how they had found the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|Sword of Gryffindor]]. Ron is frantic, shouting her name and pounding the walls, as her screams reduce him to sobs. Once freed from the dungeons, Ron concentrates his efforts on saving Hermione, and though she has been tortured nearly to the point of being unconscious, it seems that Ron's efforts do have some effect. When she has recovered, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shell Cottage|Shell Cottage]], she no longer seems quite as distant.

After their arrival at Hogwarts, with the Final Battle in Hogwarts' grounds becoming inevitable, Ron expresses his worry for the house-elves and asks if he and Hermione should tell them to go away so that they don't get killed. This act of maturity and selflessness from Ron prompts Hermione to kiss him, apparently moving their relationship forwards as Ginny had earlier similarly done with Harry.

In the Epilogue, &quot;Nineteen Years Later&quot;, Hermione is married to Ron and they have two children, Rose and Hugo. Rose is going to start Hogwarts that year. The happiness apparent in the epilogue, as Ron jokes numerous times with Hermione, shows that they are both very content with their relationship.

== Notable Consequences ==

Just before Christmas in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', Hermione comments that Ron has the emotional depth of a teaspoon. We have seen this repeatedly; Ron seems oblivious to how his words can be hurtful to others, though he sometimes says things deliberately; many of his more provocative utterances in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' are meant to sting Hermione, as retaliation either for arranging for Harry's Firebolt broom to be confiscated by McGonagall, or for her apparent callousness when his pet rat appears to have been killed by her cat, Crookshanks. Ron has hurt Hermione so many times that one wonders why she stays around. Her undeclared romantic feelings for Ron is likely the only thing keeping her there, but it also fuels her exasperation: how could she care so much about someone who behaves so stupidly?

It is Hermione's caring about Ron so much, also, that delays his return to the group in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''. Ron had no way to locate Harry and Hermione's next campsite once they had departed the one Ron had left from. To spare Hermione's feelings, Harry avoids mentioning Ron by name, and so neither does Hermione. Only when Hermione eventually speaks Ron's name does [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deluminator|Deluminator]] detect it, leading Ron to Harry and Hermione. If Harry or Hermione had spoken Ron's name sooner, the Deluminator could have led him back more quickly.

== Analysis ==

It is interesting to see how single-minded Hermione is in pursuing Ron. There are side-lights, of course; Viktor Krum is an interesting companion for a while, and she continues writing to him after he returns to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]], but one suspects she keeps the communication lines with Viktor open as a means to gather information, and also in case Krum has some later role to play in the fight against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]].

The author has mentioned &quot;anvil-sized hints&quot; being dropped about Ron and Hermione getting together since about ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''. It is in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 23|that book]] that we can see Ron's growing jealousy towards anyone daring to show a romantic interest in Hermione.

A red herring is seen in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 14|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], however; Ron expresses the same indignation when he finds [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] snogging. Could Ron regard Hermione as a sister? Actually, we see that Ron is acting protective towards Ginny, and is jealous towards Hermione, but the difference is subtle.

We never know exactly what was going on between Viktor and Hermione. True, Ginny does tell Ron that Hermione and Viktor snogged, but this is inconclusive, as Ginny was in mid-quarrel with Ron, trying to verbally hurt him. Ginny may only be repeating rumours, embellishing them for effect. Viktor would certainly like to spend time snogging with Hermione; what is uncertain is whether he actually has. Hermione clearly set her sights on Ron early in the series, and expresses that intent after the Yule Ball, before Viktor has decided to ask if Harry has left the field clear for him. It is uncertain if Hermione would jeopardize her potential relationship with Ron by being known to be snogging with Viktor. It is barely possible that Hermione, following the example of Cho Chang in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 25|Harry's fifth year]], which led to that couple's Valentine's Day meltdown, may have been mentioning other suitors to gauge or increase Ron's commitment to her. However, as Hermione seems aware of how and why that failed to work, it seems unlikely that Hermione would try a similar tactic on Ron. Against this, we must mention Harry's apparent lack of surprise at Ginny's accusation; this would appear, at first glance, to indicate that Harry was aware of romantic activity between Hermione and Viktor. On re-reading, however, his reaction seems to be bemusement, leading us to believe it more likely that the appearance of Viktor in Ginny's diatribe is not based on actual fact.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

It is interesting to note that Ginny Weasley and Hermione have each set their sights on one particular boy, and throughout the series will act with a certain single-mindedness to get him. Hermione, we see here, has decided that Ron is the one for her, and seems set on catching him, while Ginny is equally centered on capturing Harry. We will find out that Hermione had advised Ginny to give up on Harry when Harry fell for Cho Chang; this is the point at which Ginny started going out with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Michael Corner|Michael Corner]]. It is peculiar, then, that Hermione is unable, or unwilling, to follow her own advice when Ron and Lavender become an item. Perhaps it is simpler for her to see problems in Ginny's romantic life than in her own; it certainly is true in real life that it is easier to see other people's problems than to see your own.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Existential Psychotherapy}}

Existential psychotherapy is the only established form of psychotherapy that is directly based in philosophy rather than in psychology.  It was founded at the beginning of the century, on the one hand by the original work of Karl Jaspers in Germany, ( 1951, 1963, 1964) which itself influenced Heidegger’s thinking and on the other hand by the work of two Swiss psychiatrists, Ludwig Binswanger (1946, 1963) and Medard Boss (1957, 1962, 1979, 1988), who were in turn inspired by the work of Heidegger to create an alternative method of dealing with emotional and mental distress.  All three turned from psychiatry to philosophy, in an attempt to understand the human predicament, paradoxes and conflicts of their patients. These early applications of existentialist philosophy to psychotherapy have been followed by a number of other and varied attempts, as for instance in the work of Frankl (1946, 1955, 1967), May (1958, 1969, 1983), Laing (1960, 1961, 1964, 1967), Szasz (1961, 1965, 1992) Yalom (1980, 1989) and van Deurzen (1984, 1988, 19, 1997). 

There has however continued to be great diversity between these and other authors as no official or formal rendering of existential psychotherapy has ever been agreed. To confuse matters further existential principles have also been applied more indirectly to psychotherapy as part of the humanistic psychology movement, for instance in Person-centred and Gestalt approaches to psychotherapy, which often pride themselves in their existential origins. Personal-construct therapies also have a basis in the phenomenological approach and there are a number of psychoanalytic writers who take existential ideas into account as well.  All of these approaches however tend to focus on the intra-personal dimensions of human existence and they have formulated psychological theories that do not allow the philosophical dimension to come to the fore or to be central.  Radical existential psychotherapy focuses on the inter-personal and supra-personal dimensions, as it tries to capture and question people’s world-views.  Such existential work aims at clarifying and understanding personal values and beliefs, making explicit what was previously implicit and unsaid. Its practice is primarily philosophical and seeks to enable a person to live more deliberately, more authentically and more purposefully, whilst accepting the limitations and contradictions of human existence.  It has much in common with the newly developed practice of philosophical consultancy, which is just finding its feet in Germany, the Netherlands, Israel and the United States (Lahav 1995, Achenbach 1984, Hoogendijk 1991).

There continues to be a lack of systematic theorizing about existential psychotherapy and a lack of research to demonstrate the effectiveness of this kind of work.  This is mostly because the existential approach resists formalisation and opposes the fabrication of a method that can be taught as a technique and followed automatically. Existential psychotherapy has to be reinvented and recreated by every therapist and with every new client.  It is essentially about investigating human existence and the particular preoccupations of one individual and this has to be done without preconceptions or set ways of proceeding.  There has to be complete openness to the individual situation and an attitude of wonder that will allow the specific circumstances and experiences to unfold in their own right.  We can however distinguish a number of themes that will predictably emerge in this process.  The following list of existential issues is a personal selection based on the compilation of the work of the major  philosophers of existence.  The order in which the issues are presented and discussed is based on my experience of teaching trainee psychotherapists some of the predictable patterns that emerge when clients in psychotherapy present their concerns and begin to examine their lives in a philosophical manner.   Of course life is a great deal more complex than this list suggests and one can look at the same issues in many different ways.  What follows is a brief description of my particular pathway towards clarity. It is important to remember that existential psychotherapists aim to assist their clients in finding their own. 

'''EXISTENTIAL ISSUES'''
	
'''•	Ontological description'''

The first thing to keep in mind when applying philosophy to psychotherapeutic practice is that when philosophers think about human living they do so not as anthropologists or psychologists.  They do not primarily preoccupy themselves with concrete experiences, but they rather allow themselves to build theories about human living in an abstract sense.  They are concerned to describe the ontological dimension of life and only secondarily come to the concrete experience of the individual.  They try to pinpoint what it is that makes human living possible and difficult in the first place. Ontological descriptions are thus descriptions that tell us what the sine qua non of human existence is.  They sketch out the conditions without which there would be no real human life.  It is extremely useful to ask oneself what the basic foundations of human living are.  Heidegger’s book Being and Time (Heidegger 1927) is just such an attempt at describing the essential being in the world of humans.  His consideration of human beings as Dasein, or being-in-the-world, redefines questions of self and psychology as questions of living and philosophy.  His sharp thinking about what makes human being possible provides a useful map of existence, which can certainly be argued with and revised, but which nevertheless asks important questions about people in general, allowing for a closer examination of the particular individual life afterwards.  Of course there are many such possible maps and ontological theories to be found in philosophy.  Existential philosophy is particularly focussed on the predictable dilemmas of human living that will be regularly encountered when doing psychotherapy. 
	
'''•	Meaning of life'''

According to Heidegger the most fundamental philosophical question is: ‘Why is there something rather than nothing?’  We do not actually know the answer to this question, but it remains a fundamental question to ask ourselves if we are going to be serious about examining human living from scratch.  Clients ask themselves this question regularly and in particular they are unclear about the meaning of their own life.  Philosophers show such questioning to be necessary in order to become a self-reflective human being. Doubts about the meaning of life are the beginning of all philosophy.  Doubt and wonder enable us to rediscover the miracle of being. Children have not lost this ability to wonder and they ask the question ‘why’ at the most inopportune moments.  Adults tend to wonder about the meaning of life particularly when things are difficult and no longer self-evident.   Once upon a time the meaning of life was given by religion or by social rule. These days meaning is often looked at in a far more sceptical manner (see Tantam, this volume).  It is therefore not surprising that people often find themselves in what we can be called a vacuum of meaning (Frankl 1946,1955). The experience of meaninglessness becomes a major problem in many people’s lives and it may lead to a number of concrete difficulties, which may look like personality problems or other forms of pathology.  Psychotherapists, psychologists or psychiatrists often have considerable difficulties in recognizing the validity of philosophical questioning.  They are reluctant to engage in theoretical discussions with clients and patients who are seemingly disturbed, but who actually may be in search of meaning.   We can only engage in such discussions if we have been willing to question our own lives and can recognize that anxieties and doubts about meaning do not have to be equated with personal pathology or mental illness (Szasz 1961, 1965, 1992). 

It is by no means easy to be truly available to help others in finding meaning in their lives when their existence is in crisis.  The meaning of life is never given and can not be transmitted unless a person is willing to search for it independently.  Phenomenologists recognized that meaning making is one of the defining characteristics of human consciousness.  It could therefore be argued that the meaning of human living is to learn to give it meaning.  In order to come to a position from which we can learn to give meaning we have to first come to a point of doubt and a realization of the lack of intrinsic meaning in our lives.  Frankl (1946) spoke of three sources of meaning.  Firstly through taking from the world what is there, learning to savour and appreciate what is already given to us, as in aesthetic enjoyment of nature or the pleasures of the senses.  Secondly to give to the world and add new enjoyments to it through acts of our own creativity and by giving to others in this way as well. Thirdly by our attitudinal values, which could include suffering, when it is necessary to endure the harsh conditions we may be exposed to.  If there is no alternative to our suffering, it is always possible to find an attitude of human dignity by enduring the hard labour, pain and disappointments, Frankl argues, even when we have to face up to extremes of torture and deprivation.

'''•	Existential anxiety'''

The experience of meaninglessness and the creation of meaning are closely related to the experience of Angst or existential anxiety.  This occurs against the backdrop of the personal realization that I am ultimately alone in the world and that I have to contend with my mortality and other limitations, taking responsibility for myself in the face of endless challenges and confusions.  This crisis of meaning was first described by Kierkegaard (1844, 1855), who thought that it was a great deal preferable to begin to feel anxious about life and  question it, rather than to live in the despair of those who deny the need to think for themselves.  Kierkegaard thought that human beings would only gradually become capable of such questioning.  He believed that people are vegetative to start out with, not taking much notice of the meaning of anything at first.  They then grow sentient as they are beginning to follow their senses and relate more intensely to the world.  After this they grow conscious of the world around them and as they begin to form judgements about things, eventually they become knowing about some of what is.  Out of knowing can grow self-knowing as we apply the ability to think and recognize, compare and judge for ourselves.  Out of self-knowing can come a self-awareness that leads to autonomy and the ability to make choices and decisions for oneself.  This process plunges us into Angst, or existential anxiety, likened by Kierkegaard to a dizziness of freedom.  He thought that experiencing Angst was the sine qua non of us assuming our responsibility as individuals and that without it we could never come face to face with the demands our life makes on us. 

Anxiety or Angst is a core concept in existential philosophy, which sees it as the basic ingredient of vitality.  Learning to be anxious in the right way, i.e. not too much or too little is the key to living a reflective, meaningful human life.  As Kierkegaard put it:

Whoever has learnt to be anxious in the right way has learnt the ultimate. (Kierkegaard 1844:155)

Anxiety has to be distinguished from fear.  The former is a generalized feeling of  Unheimlichkeit (Heidegger 1927), of not being at ease, or at home in one’s world, whereas the latter has a concrete object.  It is anxiety that allows us to define ourselves as a separate person and to become responsive and responsible as well as aware and alert.  Although we may become overwhelmed with anxiety, so that it becomes counterproductive, on the whole anxiety is to be seen as a positive breakthrough towards the goal of the fully lived human life. 
 
'''•	How are we to live our lives?'''

In this sense existential psychotherapy does not reassure people when they come to talk about the predicaments and conflicts in their lives.  They are encouraged to consider their anxiety and their problems as a valid starting point for the work that has to be done. When people wonder what is wrong with their life it is tempting to treat such questioning as symptomatic of emotional problems, but existential psychotherapy sees it as an attempt at coming to grips with philosophical dilemmas.  Most of us are all likely to encounter such dilemmas sooner or later and people should be assisted in getting clarity on how they want to live when such issues arise.  People easily lose their sense of direction.  Moral and ethical issues are increasingly obscure in the world we live in today.  It may be helpful to turn to Nietzsche’s challenge (Nietzsche 1883) that we should re-value all values.  He insisted that our thinking had gone astray and that much that people took for granted had to be reconsidered.  He thought it crucial to consider afresh what a good human life consists of.   In order to do so it is useful to turn to the map of human existence that can be pieced together from the writings of existential philosophers, so that we can find our way through the obstacles of human living without losing our bearings. 
 
'''•	Intentionality'''

The lynchpin of human existence is the concept of intentionality.  It was Husserl’s phenomenology that established intentionality as its new foundation following Brentano’s original idea (Husserl 1900, 1913, 1929).  Phenomenology posits that human consciousness is essentially transparent and in this sense is always and necessarily connected to a world.  It is never independent and always has an object. As we are non-substantial, transparent, beings we cannot but reach out to a world.  We are always in relation.  Through us the world comes to light.  We always, think, do, desire, imagine something.  There always is some contents to our mind.  It is possible to set aside our automatic ways of intending things and judging things and take heed of our tendency to do so.  We can learn to be disciplined about our intentionality and through the phenomenological reduction question all the automatic judgements we normally take for granted.  Husserl called this process ‘coming to things themselves’ and it is often referred to as the epoche.  It consists of putting our usual assumptions about the world in brackets.  This does not mean that we get rid of them or pretend they do not exist, but rather that we deal with them separately so that we can describe the situation, object of our attention or other person we are dealing with fairly and as it really is.   To make oneself consistently query one’s assumptions about the world and reconsider it with a cleared attitude of openness is obviously extremely relevant to the practice of psychotherapy.  What we find when we apply this manner of observing other people is that they themselves are always in a relationship of intentionality to the world they live in.  It is their mode of being in the world that we need to turn to next. 

'''•	Lived world'''

Husserl spoke of the Lebenswelt, or lived world to describe the sort of universe that we live in.  Everyone has their own perspective on the world, their own particular point of reference their own atmosphere and outlook. The lived world of the cat is obviously different to that of the dog or the bird for instance.  When a cat comes into a room it may seek out cosy hiding places, while a dog may orientate himself by his sense of smell, looking for good spots to lift a leg on, whereas a bird might be focused on finding high places to perch on.  The same room would seem a very different place to different people.  In an even more complex manner they have a world of their own. This world determines where people go and what they want and do.  Heidegger (1927) described the human world in quite a lot of detail, showing it to always have a horizon, a home ground and a foreign ground.  We are always at a certain distance from things, although our relation to things might be determined by our intentional stance towards them more than by the actual space that separates us.  When I run for the bus for instance, it seems closer to me than the ground that I run over.  I see it as near and if it suddenly pulls out the severance that I experience and the sudden distance between me and the object of my desire may plunge me into confusion and disappointment.  To describe the experiences of my world as completely as possible and without the usual assumption that I already know what I am describing leads to new insights into what human living entails. 

'''•	Situations'''

We discover immediately that people are always connected to the world in a number of concrete ways.  Heidegger in this context spoke of our ‘thrownness’.  He said that we are always thrown into a world that is already there to start with and into which we simply get inserted.  It is important to recognize the factual situations that we are confronted with.  We are part of a certain culture, a certain environment with a particular climate and history, a certain society and a specific situation.  It is only within the givens of that situation that we can exercise our own choices.  Sartre (1943) called this our facticity and he recognized that we can never release ourselves from this, even though we can choose our position in relation to it.  In terms of psychotherapy it also means that it may be necessary to look at people’s problems in a structural way.  Instead of seeing everything as the person’s personal, emotional or internal problem, problems can be seen as part of an overall situation.  Context is crucial and has to be taken into account. 
	
'''•	Limit situations'''

Of all the situations in which we can find ourselves there are certain ones that are irrevocable. These situations have to be accepted.  We cannot avoid them or overcome them: we have to learn to live with them.  Heidegger emphasised the importance of death as a marker of our finite nature.  Death in this sense is not to be taken as something happening to us at some point later, but as something that is relevant to us right now.  The realities of our mortality and of our incompleteness have to be faced for us to become aware of and true to our nature, which is to be finite. Heidegger considered that the reality of our death is that it completes us. The recognition of the inevitability of death gives us a certainty that nothing else can give us. The fear in the face of death allows us to claim back our individuality, our authentic being, as we are inevitably alone in death and find ourselves much sobered and humbled by the knowledge of our mortality.  Death, according to Heidegger:

amounts to the disclosedness of the fact that Dasein exists as thrown being towards its end. (Heidegger 1927:251)

In other words: death is part of me and to accept my living towards this end gives my life back to me in a new way. 

Jaspers (1951, 1971) spoke of limit situations as those situations, which define our humanity.  Sooner or later we inevitably come up against guilt, death, pain, suffering and failure.  The philosophical take on  this is that we should encourage people to come to terms with some of the inevitable conflicts and problems of living whilst also asking themselves how they can move forward in a new and desirable direction.  Limit situations are what bring us in confrontation with ourselves in a decisive and fundamentally disturbing way.  They evoke anxiety and therefore release us from our tendency to be untrue and evasive about ourselves and our lives.  

'''•	Self-deception'''
 
Sartre was particularly adamant that as human beings we try to pretend that we are solid and definite in the way that objects are.  People do not like to face up to their fundamental nothingness and mortality.  We think we can pretend to be like a stone or a solid thing, but in fact in doing so we are deceiving ourselves, reinventing ourselves in bad faith (Sartre 1943).  To be in bad faith is an almost unavoidable state of play for human beings as we seem to find it particularly difficult to face up to the implications of our freedom as consciousness.  One of the objectives of human living is to become increasingly aware of our ability to choose to live deliberately rather than by default and to diminish the extent to which we seek to tell ourselves false stories about ourselves.  Sartre said that the only choice we do not have is not to choose because not to choose involves a choice as well. 

In fact we are a freedom which chooses, but we do not choose to be free. (Sartre 1943:485)

The coward is fulfilling the project of cowardice, in the same way in which the hero is fulfilling the project of heroism. They can both either choose to take responsibility for their choice or pretend that it just happened to them and is not open to question.

Heidegger saw the existence of other people, with whom we are fallen into a world where the anonymous ‘They’ decides about our actions and our identity as the major obstacle to authenticity.  He recognized, as Sartre did, that human beings are condemned to living inauthentically for much of the time, but that we should nevertheless aim to retrieve ourselves from inauthenticity.   It is the anxiety of our possible death and our discovery that we are alone in the face of our own fate and destiny that allows us ultimately to take ourselves seriously and posit ourselves firmly, resolutely as individuals facing death. 

'''•	Time'''

This is when it also becomes possible to become more aware of the dimension of time, which is a crucial category of human living.  It is always today and not tomorrow or yesterday.  I am always no longer and not yet.  We orientate ourselves in relation to the various ways in which we stand out in time.  Our lives are a constant process of transformation that we cannot stop.  Heidegger spoke of the three ec-stasies of time (Heidegger 1927:329), which are the ways in which we stand out in the past, in the present and in the future. We go back to ourselves in terms of remembering the past.  We let ourselves be encountered by the world in the present and we reach out towards ourselves in the future.  The past (Erbe) is the legacy we go forward with and which we can recollect in different ways.  This means that we can re-present the past to ourselves in a new and creative manner.  The present is our fate (Schiksal), which we have the task to live out as fully as possible, obviously drawing on the legacy of the past and making ourselves present to our own fate by facing our limitations rather than hiding away in inauthenticity.  The future is our destiny (Geschick) and the destination that we choose for ourselves in relation to what is available to us.  Our destination is thus created from our legacy and our fate.  All of my actions are full of the awareness of my temporal change.  There is decay and development around me. Life consists of movement, transformation and action. All of these are only possible in time.  My existence is historic.  It creates a story.   How I create this story is of utmost importance.  Existential psychotherapy is about retracing the story and reorienting a person in time. 

'''•	The fragile self'''

The way in which I tell my story is the way in which I create a self.   Existential philosophy does not posit the notion of a fixed and determined self.  There is no such thing as an essential solid self, only intentionality and being in the world.  Sartre used to say that existence preceded essence.  I come into the world first and exist and only after that do I create a self for myself out of my actions.    The self is a window on the world and out of our living in time and standing out in the world we become what we are.  Sartre went as far as to say that people were the sum of their actions.  Therefore the choices we make are constitutive of the sort of person we become.  We are constantly in the process of creating a self, yet when we try to capture this self, we realize it is as if we were trying to catch our shadow: it moves away from us and changes as we try to fix it.  We cannot be a definitive something.  Our stories change as we live and so we are changed too.  As we saw before the only way in which we can believe in a self is by being in bad faith, i.e. by using self-deception.  Any image we create of ourselves is in a sense a lie: it never tells the full story about who we are or could be.  We have to re-create ourselves every day and to become aware of this is to become authentic and true to the self which isn’t one.  We are thus doomed to feel a sense of incompleteness as life requires us to try ever harder to be equal to what we are capable of, even though we can never achieve it. 

'''•	Existential guilt'''

Most of us will therefore have a frequent sensation of unease with ourselves.  The awareness that we are not true to our full human ability and that we live inauthentically will lead to the experience of existential guilt.  In existential guilt we hear the voice of our conscience and this must be taken extremely seriously.  We are not guilty because we have fallen short by other people’s standards or because we have behaved badly, but simply because we fall short  as human beings.  It is important to note that most existential philosophers assume that human living will inevitably expose us to falling short and therefore to feeling existential guilt.  We are always indebted to life.  We are always capable of being more alive, more open, more true to the potential of human consciousness than we actually are.  We are therefore condemned to feel existential guilt, as we are condemned to feel existential anxiety; largely because we are, as Sartre said condemned to be free.  Heidegger greatly valued the call of conscience which he believed to warn us of our existential guilt, thus bringing us back into confrontation with our human fate, allowing us to rediscover our authentic being. 

The call is the call of care. Being guilty constitutes the Being to which we give the name of “care”.  (Heidegger 1927:333)

To become authentic requires us to take into account our essential ways of existing and conduct ourselves accordingly. All of these modalities of existence, which Heidegger refers to as the existentialia are consequences of our intentional nature. 
	
'''•	Care'''
	
Our intentional nature, and the nature of our consciousness as the place where being comes to light, as Heidegger put it, makes us care.  People are the custodians of Being because they are nothing in themselves but need to reflect something, in order to fully exist.  As transparent entities human beings are therefore condemned to care.  The world always matters to us and we have to take account of our care for the world, which manifests in lots of different ways.  It is therefore not the question whether we care, but how.  Care is not to be understood as a negative or a positive, but rather as the inevitable mode of our relating to a world that is of importance to us. Heidegger speaks of care as manifesting as our concern for things and our solicitude for people.  But our care also manifests in some specific ways in which we are in the world and relate to it.   

'''•	Mood'''

The fact that the world always matters to us is evident in the way in which we are always in a mood.  We cannot be separate from the world, but always respond to it in a particular state of mind.  Heidegger (1927: 134) called this: Befindlichkeit, or the way in which I find myself.  This state of mind is a response to the atmosphere created between the world, and me by my care for what is happening in it.  Stimmung, or attunement, is the way in which I respond to the atmospheres, the way in which, like a musical instrument I am attuned in a particular way to the world around me.  Through my resonance with the world I disclose the world in a particular way.  My mood colours the world as it is also coloured by it.  My own being is disclosed in my moods at the same time as it discloses the world.  Moods are therefore invaluable indicators of what is happening between my world and me.  We can never not be in a mood and we cannot just stop a mood.  We can only get out of one mood by getting into another. Sartre elaborated on this idea of the central position of mood or mode of being by describing emotions as active rather than passive.  He spoke of emotion as a kind of magic by which I alter the world and therefore myself in one blow (Sartre 1939). 
	
'''•	Understanding'''

As human beings we can respond to the world through our emotions, but we can also through our emotions and our ability to reflect on them come to grasp things in a new way.   This new way of understanding (verstehen) is not just about human intelligence and the capacity for calculating things in the world.   Heidegger makes the distinction between Vernunft (rational mind) and Verstand (understanding) which is our ability to see the whole of what is rather than analyse things with our mind (Heidegger 1927:144). Understanding discloses the potential of our being, as it shows us what we are capable of.  In his later work he made the distinction between calculative thinking and meditative thinking  (Heidegger 1954).  He showed how important it was to learn to think again in this more encompassing meditative manner where we are open to the world and receive it with gratitude for what is, rather than trying to subject it to the analysis and manipulations that our calculative mind imposes.  Heidegger suggests that we use Sicht, or vision to understand the world and our relation to it.  Umsicht, or the vision of looking around one, applies to objects and we need to approach objects with the care of circumspection.  We use Rucksicht, which suggests a kind of withholding, in relation to other people, which manifests as considerateness.  Finally and perhaps most importantly we employ Durchsicht, or seeing through things in relation to ourselves.  It is thus transparency that brings into being careful understanding of ourselves. 
	
'''•	Discourse'''

Language is an essential vehicle for understanding our modes of being.  Heidegger speaks of discourse as the third essential mode of being (together with mood and understanding).  Discourse is a broader concept than language and includes it.  Although discourse is obviously linked to language it can also manifest as silence.  We have to struggle to retrieve valuable discourse out of all the possible misuses of talking.  Speech can turn to idle talk (Gerede rather than Rede). Discourse can flounder in curiosity, which is a moving across the surface of things, distracted by their novelty, as we collect and accumulate useless information.  In this way we drown in existence and we go under in ambiguity. (Merleau Ponty 1945).  Discourse is to be used carefully for it to become a valuable resource for the manifestation of being.  In language or in silent thought we can capture and express ourselves in relation to life and begin to come to terms with our essential function of being the shepherds of being. 
 
'''•	Communication'''

The mastery of language makes human communication possible.  However communication is a lot more complex than simple speech.  Heidegger was aware that Mitsein, or being with others, was part of our essential nature.  He also described people as at the mercy of the anonymous other who defines their being-in-the-world.  Authentic being is only possible when we set ourselves aside from others. Sartre described our struggle with others as a desperate attempt at survival and at gaining a false sense of security.  He saw human communication, which is by no means only about language as taking place either in a sadistic, a masochistic or an indifferent way.  We can try to dominate the other or we can submit or withdraw from communication altogether.   In sharp contrast to Sartre’s pessimistic view of human relations and human communication the philosopher Martin Buber (1923,1929) saw the possibility of a more positive way of human interaction.  He distinguished between I-it and I-Thou modes of relating.  He noted that the way we relate to others determines what kind of  person we become.  In the I-It mode of relating I treat the other as an object and become an object myself.  In this mode I see the other only for part of what the other is capable of and at the same time become partial myself.   In the I-Thou mode I relate to the other for all the other is capable of and I relate thus with my whole being as well.  The I-Thou mode of relating has a spiritual dimension.  Buber described the way in which we create a space between others and ourselves. In this space human communication becomes a reality.  He called this space the in-between.  True dialogue can be created in this space when we release our self-reserve and reach out to the other with our whole being. 

Where un-reserve has ruled, even wordlessly, between men, the word of dialogue has happened sacramentally. (Buber 1929:3-4).

'''•	Mastered irony'''

Kierkegaard believed that language should be used with what he calls mastered irony. This requires the ability to detach oneself sufficiently from one’s situation to be able to see oneself in some perspective.  He claims that those who lack irony do not have even the beginning of a personal life.  To have a personal life and be able to be objective about oneself and subjective about others is to Kierkegaard a primary objective.

Most men are subjective toward themselves and objective toward all others, frightfully objective sometimes-but the task is precisely to be objective toward oneself and subjective toward all others. (Kierkegaard 1967, IV 4542).

He distinguishes fanatics, who cling to certain beliefs and nihilists who deny all beliefs, but sees them both as lacking in courage. In mastered irony one questions one’s own beliefs while still being committed to them.  As usual the challenge is to be able to live in the tension between opposites.  

'''•	Paradox'''

This idea that human living takes place in the tension between opposing forces is present throughout existential philosophy.  Most obviously this is represented by Heidegger’s (1927) description of the tension between life and death, or by Sartre’s descriptions of the tension between being and nothingness, expressed in the tension between being-for-itself (the being of consciousness) and being-in-itself (the being of objects) (Sartre 1943). Kierkegaard for his part described this tension as one between the infinite and the finite. He claimed that one can get too much drawn into either the finite or the infinite and that the challenge of living is to maintain the right sort of tension between both.  The person who is immersed in the finite gets caught up in the dangers of concrete living.  The person who gets too immersed in the infinite is the dreamer, who merges with the universe and becomes either overwhelmed or terrified or depressed by it ending up feeling alienated from everyday reality.   Kierkegaard thought it was important to be capable of modulating between the two extremes.  Merleau Ponty was equally aware of the paradoxical nature of human living and he firmly believed that we have to live with what amounts to an essential ambiguity (Merleau Ponty 1945, 1968).

'''•	The four dimensional force field'''
In this force field of opposites there are a number of different dimensions of experience. Systematic descriptions of human experience have outlined four dimensions. Heidegger spoke of the different dimensions as those of earth, world, man, and gods (Heidegger 1957). Binswanger (1946,1963) spoke of the Umwelt (environment), Mitwelt (world with others) and Eigenwelt (personal world), whilst a spiritual dimension (Uberwelt) is also implied in his work (van Deurzen-Smith 1984). In essence philosophers have recognized that human experience is multiple and complex and takes place on a number of different levels.  Firstly there is our involvement in a physical world of objects, where we struggle between survival and death. Secondly there is our activity in a social world of other people, where we struggle with the contradictions between our need to belong and the possibility of our isolation. Thirdly there is a personal dimension where we grapple with the tension between integrity and disintegration. Finally there is a spiritual dimension where we seek to find meaning against the threat of meaninglessness.  On each of these dimensions we have to learn to stand in the tension between opposites, discovering that we cannot have life without death, love without hate, identity without confusion, and wisdom without doubt.  As Paul Tillich once said:

The courage of confidence takes the anxiety of fate as well as the anxiety of guilt into itself  (Tillich 1952:163).

==Introduction==
Credibility in education covers a wide range of issues.  Among these are the credibility of the teacher, credibility of instructional resources, the credibility of information, and the credibility of research material.

'''The best of teachers, and there are many of them, know the importance of teaching.  They not only teach to the mind, but teach to the heart as well&quot;.  - Timothy Sullivan - President/College of William and Mary 1992-2005.  
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==Credibility of the Teacher==

A credible person is expert (experienced, qualified, intelligent, skilled) and trustworthy (honest, fair, unselfish, caring) (ChangingMinds, 2007).  Grounded in Aristotle’s concept of ethos, McCroskey and Young (1981) defined the concept credibility as “believability.”  The constructed credibility of an individual is primarily dependent upon how they are perceived by others (Robinson &amp; King, 2000).  Knowledge and expertise of subject matter, honesty of intent, and concern for others all play into teacher credibility. With credibility involving more belief than fact it is strongly situated via the &quot;eye of the beholder&quot;, allowing for such things as accuracy and reality to be irrelevant(Kougl, 1997).  Credibility, a subjective way of thought, seems most prevalent and necessary to attain within the classroom setting (Robinson, T. &amp; King, T., 2002).

Knight, 2000, organizes the characteristics of a credible teacher as one who possesses competence, trustworthiness, and dynamism.  
 
Competence is the perceived “expertness” of the speaker, i.e., their knowledge of matter (Knight).  No one can argue the fact that a teacher must have mastered the subject matter in order to develop credibility in his/her field. However, if a teacher fails to deliver the subject matter in a way that is logical and meaningful to the student, credibility will be lost.  In order to enhance credibility in delivery of material teachers must possess good classroom management skills, have the ability to answer questions, possess a broad range of information, and have the ability to explain complex material well (Knight).  

Trustworthiness refers to whether or not the teacher has the best interest of the students at heart (Knight).  The student knows whether or not the teacher truly cares about his/her success in the class.  Teachers who work to develop this trust must develop relationships with their students that foster teacher-student dialog.  They know their students.  This knowledge extends beyond the academic abilities of the student.  The teacher should know about the student's home life, learning style, special abilities, and any extracurricular activities the student may participate in.  If at all possible, teachers should make attempts to attend outside events that their students are involved in. In addition, teachers who are consistent and fair with classroom discipline, work to include all students in activities, treat all students the same, and do not embarrasss students are more likely to develop trustworthiness with their students. 

Dynamism refers to how a teacher presents his/her self in daily interactions with students and the curricular activities.  Teachers must present material in a manner that excites the students about the topic of discussion.  Diversity in delivery of instruction, use of technology, games, discussions, and investigations are all methods that lend diversity to presentation of material.  However, even the most exciting method of instruction can fail to excite students when the teacher is not enthusiastic in the delivery.  A more recent factor receiving notice by scholars is that of teacher immediacy, which refers to the use of communication behaviors (e.g., movement, enthusiasm, use of gesters, humor, vocal variety) that reduce both the psychological and physical distance between two individuals (Myers, Zhong &amp; Guan, 1998).  Whether at the conscious or unconscious level, a student's perception of the teacher's ethos, or speaker's character, has an important impact on how he or she will react to the teacher and how effective the teacher will be in the classroom (Haskins, 2000).

==Credibility of Intructional Resources==

Also lending to the teacher’s credibility are the resources the teacher uses in the classroom to enhance instruction. Resources containing erroneous information that can be disproved by students puts the teacher’s reliability and trustworthiness at risk. To maintain personal credibility it is important that teachers evaluate the credibility of instructional materials and web based information used within the classroom.

==Credibility of Books==

One thing a teacher may do in preparation for presenting a new unit of study or project is to select books that may be included in the classroom library or to be used for whole group reading.  START, an acronym for Scope Treatment Authority Relevance Timeliness, is recommended by University of Minnesota Libraries (2007) to assist in determining the credibility of books. To evaluate books for instructional purposes, teachers must consider scope. For this purpose scope refers to the extent to which a topic is covered. Does the book cover the topic completely? If not, to what extent? The teacher must also consider treatment. What is the books purpose? Is the selection biased? Is the information fact based or opinion based? Are other sources cited? Also for consideration is authority. Who is the author and is he or she an expert in the subject? What company published the book? The relevance of the book must also be considered. Is the information relevant to the topic of study? Timeliness is also important when determining credibility. When was the book published or copyrighted? Is the information current? Is the information still useful?

==Credibility  of Software==

Software is an instructional tool that teachers often use in the classroom. Teachers can use anything from games to encyclopedias, all of which can be credible sources for learning.  Different types of games can include cognitive development games and skill practice games.  Many teachers are skeptical about using games in the classroom and feel that they are not credible; however, games can often be a very credible for student learning.  For example, games help teachers gain students' attention and increase their motivation to learn (Using games for learning, 2000).  Regardless of the type of software that the teacher chooses to use, when evaluating software for instructional use, the teacher should approach the software as a student. If the software is billed as user friendly, is it? Is it as engaging as the reviews suggest? Is the information biased? Is any of the content potentially offensive to any group of students? Is the information presented factual?

==Information Overload==

There is no question that this is the information age. Modern technlogy has brought with it the ability for immediate access to seemingly limitless amounts of information. The click of a mouse opens the door to an overflow of information about topics as trivial as Paris Hilton’s latest follies to topics as consequential as global warming. Any teacher with “googling” capability can use the Internet to enhance instruction in any discipline. A Google search can yield so many choices that a teacher may not know where to begin. In January 1994, the World Wide Web consisted of 900 websites. In May 2007, there were 118, 023, 363 sites on the Internet (http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html). Google catalogs billions of web pages that make up web sites. Because there is such an enormous amount of information on the Web, “it seems impossible that all of the sites can be considered credible” making it important to determine the credibility of sites considered for use within the classroom (Greer, ''et al.'', 2002).

==So Easy Even a Caveman Can Do It==

With the availability of site builder web sites and web site development software, anybody can create a web site to be included on the Internet.  Wikimedia makes it even easier for Internet users to become content contributors to the World Wide Web. Few barriers stop people from publishing on the Web. The online world contains deceptive coverage of current events, health information that is factually incorrect, and ads that promise the impossible (Fogg,''et al.'', 2002). With anyone able to post information on the Internet for the world to see, how can teachers be certain of the credibility of the information presented? Teachers, as well as students, need to be educated on how to evaluate this information to determine its validity.

==Credibility of Online Information==

Peer review, author credibility, and writing style are three traditional methods utilized to determine credibility (Standler, 2003). These traditional methods may be difficult to employ when evaluating Internet sites because authors are no longer limited to publication by publishing companies or scholarly journals. Many writers may forego the challenges of traditional publication and instead opt for the ease of publication on the World Wide Web. This often eliminates peer review and leaves the author’s credibility unquestioned by a publisher and the work untouched by the editor’s pen. This results in increased responsibility for the teacher when selecting Internet sites for use with students. It is imperative that teachers develop a keen sense for determining the credibility of information found on the Web. Teachers must be educated on methods to ensure the credibility of this information.  Because so much information is available, and because that information can appear to be fairly &quot;anonymous&quot;, it is necessary to develop skills to evaluate what you find (Kirk, 1996). 

Even without the endorsement of peers and publishing companies, it is possible that information posted online is credible. Teachers must review information found online to determine if it meets their standards for credibility. Credibility is all about trustworthiness. After reading information presented on a web page, teachers can determine the trustworthiness by accessing prior knowledge and/or conducting research to validate the accuracy and authenticity of the ideas presented on the web page. Additionally, teachers should consider the information's relevance to what is being taught, its ability to engage students in learning, and its appropriateness for the intended users. The following link provides a list questions to consider when assessing the credibility of on-line resources: [http://leo.stcloudstate.edu/research/credibility1.html]


==Teaching Students How to Evaluate Sources for Credibility==

Teaching students how to evaluate a work for reliability and credibility becomes especially important now that they are exposed to such a large quantity of information from the Internet.  In addition to the methods already mentioned for evaluating this information, teachers would do well to teach their students at least the rudiments of logic.  Students should know, for example, the meanings of the words &quot;premise&quot; and &quot;assumption.&quot;  They should be taught to look for sufficient evidence to back up any assertions they encounter in their research, and older students should be able to distinguish between inductive and deductive reasoning.  Finally, students should be alerted to the possibility of fallacious reasoning, and older students should be able to identify such fallacies as non sequitur, broad generalization, and post hoc (illogical assignment of causation between two events that are probably unrelated).  Advertisers are often guilty of using these fallacious methods to persuade consumers to buy their products, and students will be well served by learning how unscrupulous people may try to manipulate them in this way to act against their own best interests.

==Credibility of Research==

Equally important to the credibility of the teacher is the  utilization of proven educational practices within the classroom.  The credibility of information impacts educational research.
In order for educational practices to be effective, the evaluation of these practices must be credible.  Inadequate evaluation and synthesis of extant literature impacts not only the quality of a single study, but can have cumulative effects on a body of literature that may manifest in a lineage of poor conceptualization, design, measurement, methodology, and ultimately, inferences (Dellinger, 2004).  Additionally, some researchers believe that procedural guidelines must be established for classroom action research to be considered credible (Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education, 2007).

With respect to any action research that the teacher conducts in his or her classroom, its value and credibility will be enhanced if the data so collected are triangulated, that is, are gathered by different persons or with different methods.  Simply having another observer such as a colleague come into the classroom to observe the results of a new practice the teacher is experimenting with increases the credibility of the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of the that practice.  Getting feedback from the students themselves would also increase the credibility of the findings as would evaluating the written work that students produce as a result of the practice.  The more evidence the teacher has from a variety of sources, the more likely that he or she will be able to convince administrators or colleagues to adopt his or her ideas or practices.

==Conclusion==

Credibility is often in the eye of the beholder. Competence, trustworthiness, and dynacism all contribute to teacher credibility; however, that credibility is greatly influenced by everything from how the teacher speaks to the instructional materials he or she uses. At a time when skepticism about and criticism of public education seems to be growing, it is of the utmost importance that teachers project an image of credibility and utilize resources and methods that are credible.

==Discussion Question #1==
How can you as a teacher increase your credibility as perceived by your students?

Response #1

It is vital for teachers to admit when they do not know the answer to a question.  Answering a question wrongly, especially when the student discovers the answer is wrong, is a major source of loss of credibility.  In addition, learning a new concept together brings the teacher closer to the student in the learning process.  
This is not to say that teachers do not need to know their material.  Credible teachers know their curriculum and are not threatened to learn more.  In fact, those teachers who stay current by taking courses (or other methods of gaining knowledge) are more credible than those who do not.  Students perception of this credibility is enhanced when the student knows the teacher is continuing his/her pursuit of knowledge. 

Teachers must work to develop positive relationships with their students both in and out of the classroom.  This can be accomplished by attending student events, making conversation with the student at lunch, or calling home to report positive contributions.  When I see my students in the hall, I make it a point to have a quick conversation with them.  This conversation goes beyond just saying hello.  

Teachers need to make sure that their methods of instruction are met with enthusiasm.  This means the teacher needs to be enthusiastic about the material, have the ability to excite the students about the material, and be aware of when the students are getting bored with the delivery method.  I try to 'gauge' my audience and switch things up when I feel like I am losing my audience.  Adding jokes, funny stories, or interesting demonstrations to a lecture can be effective in grabbing the students attention.

Response #2

One way to bolster credibility with students is to utilize resources and materials familiar to and trusted by students. Often as a way to engage students, I would use “kid approved” information in my lessons. For example, many pre-kindergarten and kindergarten students may be unfamiliar with the role of a scientist, but just about every student knows Jimmy Neutron from ''Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius'' and the Professor from ''The Power Puff Girls''. As a teacher, all of my science units were problem based requiring students to think like a scientist. Well, that can be challenging if the students don’t even fully understand what a scientist does. When discussing the role of a scientist, I always included information about real scientists such as George Washington Carver and Marie Curie, but for that added level of understanding and in a lot of ways, credibility, I also included information about scientists to which my primary students could relate and immediately recognize. Not only did seeing their familiar cartoon friends hook them, they were pleasantly surprised to see that even their teacher knew of Jimmy Neutron and the Professor.

==Discussion Question #2==
What is one thing you look for when evaluating the credibility of instructional materials and/or Internet sites used within your classroom?

Response #1

When evaluating the credibility of sources on the internet, I look for sources that are from reliable publications. Often I will look at the references from these publications in order to find further sources of information. Wikibooks are very new to me, so I am still a bit unsure as to how to evaluate the credibility of material found on these sites. However, I have yet to find any questionable information on the wikibook sites that I have visited. I feel that the &quot;peer&quot; review of the material and the fact that such worthy people (like our own classmate:)) are montitoring entries helps to give credibility to these sites. My feelings are that wikibooks offer some of the most up-to-date information on a broad range of topics. With many people contributing to the process, mistakes can be identified and corrected. In addition, many of the links I use in the classroom are sponsored by scientific organizations. For example, the National Science Organization provides links to many credible scientific sites that are chosen for teacher use in the classroom.

Response #2

When evaluating instructional materials and Internet sites for credibility, I consider the ideas presented and try to determine if the ideas are supported by evidence. I do that by reviewing the works cited in the bibliography or footnotes and by checking the ideas presented against what I already know.  If there are no other works cited by the author, I search for other resources that may support or disprove the work of the author.

I also consider information about the author. If there is little information about the author, I will Google the author to find additional publications by the author as well as credentials. If I am unable to find and/or verify credentials, that does not stop me from using the resource with students. I am more concerned with the accuracy and authenticity of the information than anything else.

== Derivation ==

The purpose of &quot;completing the square&quot; is to either factor a prime quadratic equation or to more easily graph a parabola. The procedure to follow is as follows for a quadratic equation &lt;math&gt; y = ax^2+bx+c &lt;/math&gt;:

1. Divide everything by ''a'', so that the number in front of &lt;math&gt; x^2 &lt;/math&gt; is a perfect square (1):
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{y}{a} = x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a} &lt;/math&gt;

2. Now we want to focus on the term in front of the ''x''. Add the quantity &lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 &lt;/math&gt; to both sides:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{y}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x +\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + \frac{c}{a} &lt;/math&gt;

3. Now notice that on the right, the first three terms factor into a perfect square:
:&lt;math&gt; x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x +\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Multiply this back out to convince yourself that this works.

4. Therefore the ''completed square'' form of the quadratic is:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{y}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + \frac{c}{a} &lt;/math&gt; or, multiplying through by a,

&lt;math&gt; y = a\left(x+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + c - \frac{b^2}{4a} &lt;/math&gt;

== Explanation of Derivation ==
[[Image:Completing_the_square_307.PNG|left|Completing The Square]] 

1. Divide everything by ''a'', so that the number in front of &lt;math&gt; x^2 &lt;/math&gt; is a perfect square (1):
:&lt;math&gt;  x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a} = {a}&lt;/math&gt;

Think of this as expressing your final result in terms of 1 square x.  If your initial equation is 


2. Now we want to focus on the term in front of the ''x''. Add the quantity &lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 &lt;/math&gt; to both sides:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{y}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x +\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + \frac{c}{a} &lt;/math&gt;


3. Now notice that on the right, the first three terms factor into a perfect square:
:&lt;math&gt; x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x +\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Multiply this back out to convince yourself that this works.

4. Therefore the ''completed square'' form of the quadratic is:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{y}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + \frac{c}{a} &lt;/math&gt; or, multiplying through by a,

== Example ==

The best way to learn to complete a square is through an example. Suppose you want to solve the following equation for x.

{|
| 2x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 24x + 23 = 0 || Does not factor easily, so we complete the square.
|-
|x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 12x + 23/2 = 0 || Make coefficient of x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; a 1, by dividing all terms by 2.
|-
|x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 12x = - 23/2 || Add – 23/2 to both sides.    
|-
|x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 12x + 36 = - 23/2 + 36 || Take half of 12 (coefficient of x), and square it. Add to both sides.
|-
|(x + 6)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 49/2 || Factor. Now we can take square roots to easily solve this form of the equation.
|-
| √(x + 6)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = √49/√2 || Take the  square root.
|-
|x + 6 =  7/√2 || Simplify. 
|-
|x = -6 + (7√2)/2 || Rationalize the denominator.

= Ruy Lopez =
The move is sometimes called the Old Steinitz Defence because it is viewed as not best for black.  The e5 is not threatened by Bxc6 so there is no need to defend the pawn.  Black allows his light square Bishop to become active, but at the same time his dark square bishop is getting blocked, so there isn't much of any gain in development.  The move also allows white to play d4 immediately.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Kant is neither rationalist nor empiricist ==

I would either change the title of this part or give Kant a section of his own. He is not an empiricist in the philosophical sense. Rather, his view was one of reconciling empiricism with rationalism. In the naive sense Kant was a scientific man and in this sense he could be considered an empiricist, but this is not relevant for the WikiBook about consciousness.

We studied a large span of history, which included many diverse topics, including: Pre-History, Stone Age, Rome, Greece, Egypt, and China, Middle Ages, Renaissance, Reformation, Scientific Method, and the spread of Christianity. Our class decided the Middle Ages and the Renaissance were the most interesting. The main purpose with this textbook is to share our knowledge.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Soft Sign (ь)==

There are occasions when a consonant which is not followed by a vowel is soft. In such cases, the мяккі знак &quot;miakki znak&quot; (soft sign) - ''ь'' - is used. It stands for no sound by istelf, but denotes the softness of the preceding consonant. In the English transliteration, we shall mark such soft consonants with an apostroph.

'''ба́цька''' &quot;bat'ka&quot; a father

'''мале́нькі''' &quot;malien'ki&quot; little

'''культу́ра''' &quot;kul'tura&quot; culture

Nouns ending with a soft consonant (i.e. a consonant + ''ь'') can be either masculine or feminine. In plural, they obtain the ''і'' ending.

'''конь''' &quot;kon'&quot; (masculine) a horse - '''ко́ні''' &quot;koni&quot; horses

'''гусь''' &quot;hus'&quot; (feminine) a goose - '''гу́сі''' &quot;husi&quot; geese

==Verbs conjugation==

The most common infinitive ending for Belarusian verbs is ''ць''.

There are two classes of verbs by their conjugation - the so called first and second conjugations. The first conjugation, as a rule, relates to verbs ending with ''аць'', ''яць'', ''эць'' and ''ець''.

Here are the typical endings for the first conjugation.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Infinitive
! я
! ты
! ён (яна, яно)
! мы
! вы
! яны

|-

| хварэ́ць
| хварэ́ю
| хварэ́еш
| хварэ́е
| хварэ́ем
| хварэ́еце
| хварэ́юць
| be ill
|}

'''Ты слу́хаеш? - Так, я слу́хаю.''' &quot;Are you listening?&quot; &quot;Yes, I am listening.&quot;

'''Вы адпачыва́еце? - Не, мы не адпачыва́ем.''' &quot;Are you having a rest?&quot; &quot;No, we are not having a rest.&quot;

'''Мой ба́цька хварэ́е.''' My father is ill.

So, to translate ''He is ill'', you may say ''Ён хворы'' or ''Ён хварэе''. But these are not the same. Using the adjective suggests a permanent state of disease. So ''Ён хворы'' means ''He is disabled''. Conversely, the verb implies a transient state of illness. ''Ён хварае'' means that he is unwell at the monent but will hopefully recover soon. 

'''A rule of thumb''': In the present and futures tenses (which will be looked at later on), you can omit the pronoun as the stem ending indicates who performs the action. i.e., you can just say &quot;чыта́ю
&quot; (I read/ I am reading) or &quot;слу́хаеш&quot; (You listen/ you are listening) and people will still understand you. This is not the case when talking about the past or conditional tenses of imperfective and perfective verbs (the reasons will be explained later). The same rules also apply in Russian and Ukrainian.

==Formal and Informal &quot;You&quot;==

The ''ты'' pronoun is only used in familiar communication, i.e. with you relatives and friends. In formal speech, the ''вы'' pronoun is used in addressing both a single person and a group of people.

When a verb is used with the polite ''вы'', it is put with its respective conjugation (can still be omitted). But if it is used with a noun or an adjective, it is coordinated by the actual gender and number, i.e. if ''вы'' is used with a single person, the singualar, not the plural, form of the adjective or the noun, is used.

'''Вы чытаеце.''' You are reading.

'''Вы студэнтка.''' (not ''Вы студэнткі'') You are a student.

'''Вы прыгожая.''' (not ''Вы прыгожыя'') You are beautiful.

In writing, the polite ''вы'', as well as the possessive ''Ваш'', is often capitalized.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There were many causes of the Middle Ages, including the Fall of Rome, Viking invaders, Charlemagne, and the spread of Christianity.

==Fall of Rome==
The fall of Rome was the largest because, as Rome fell, various groups from the north and south began to move into former Roman land. Because the empire was too large, the army had a difficult time traveling to defend land from invaders. As they moved in, powerful warlords created their own states and declared themselves king. By the early 500s, there were many small kingdoms. The small sovereignties kept fighting among themselves. Without Rome’s central government there was no central authority to keep the peace between the small territories. As a result, bandits and invaders became common.

==The Vikings==
Invaders invaded Rome and stole goods. The three most common invaders were the Vikings, Magyars, and the Franks. The invaders created mass hysteria; people were robbed, killed; there was no law or order. Entire villages were burned to the ground. It was easy for the Vikings because they were great sailors and northern Europe contained a lot of rivers. The rivers allowed the Vikings to show up without notice and destroy a town. The facts that the Vikings could come and go at any time made people’s fear grow exponentially. People were scared and looking for protection. They started feudal societies for protection because they were scared and they clung to anything that gave them hope. Christianity boomed and became the leading religion.
Charlemagne and Christianity

==Charlemagne and the Spread of Christianity==
Charlemagne tried to conquer the Roman Empire but failed. Through his wars of conquest, Charlemagne united many of the tribes of Central and Western Europe into a single empire. While Europe was still reeling from the collapse of Rome, Charlemagne brought people together. He helped Europeans realize that they shared common bonds such as Christianity that linked them. He helped people see themselves as Europeans, not members of tribes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wealth and social class were very important in the middle ages. Everyone had a different part to play in the feudal system to help out in their manor. There were two social pyramids: the Catholic Church pyramid and the social pyramid. The Catholic Church pyramid consisted of the pope at the top, then the cardinals, archbishops, bishops, and the common clergy (nuns, priests, and monks). Even though the peasants didn’t own land they were extremely important. Without the peasants the whole social system would fall. Did you know that 90 percent of the people during the Middle Ages were peasants? The king and queen were of course at the top. The nobles were the vassals of the kings and queens. Most of them were also a lord or a lower ranking knight. The knights served their nobles or lords in exchange for their land. As mentioned before the peasants were not part of the feudal system because they didn’t own land. Most of the peasants worked on land like a slave, owned by nobles or knights. This feudal system spread all the way from Eastern Europe to France, Spain, Italy, and Germany. It was a ‘divine right' to become a king or queen. The right to rule granted by God and passed on through the family. The pope was at the coronation of the kings and queens. This gave the pope the right to make or break the king or queen. The 1/10 rule applied to everyone. All of the things people gave were given to the Church. Soon the church became extremely rich. Several events lead to the collapse of Feudalism. The Magna Carta took power away from the Monarchs of Europe and the Black Death decimated the population of Europe; leaving a void in the work force and leading to the growth of cities.  As cities grew people began trading, learning and gaining wealth. The middle class, a new social class, worked for wages and began to specialize in specific jobs.  As secular rulers lost power, the power gained by the Catholic Church also began to fade.  The end of the feudal system proved that it only existed to serve the few and not the many.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Weapons and Warfare==

Weapons and warfare played a vital role in the Middle Ages. They were used to conquer and defend territories. The strength of your army became the currency of the realm. If you weren’t a soldier or noble, you were a peasant in the feudalistic society. The weapons, such as the sword, pike, and spear, were a way of life. Political problems turned into military problems, starting wars and feuds. The shield also played an important role. Many soldiers forsook the shield for their swords, but the more organized armies had strategy. This led to the growth of kingdoms, and the end of feudalism, sending Europe into the Renaissance era.

During the Middle Ages, fighting and death reached an all-time high. Even though this was happening, military skill and tactics were a joke compared to Greek, Roman, Persian, etc. warfare styles. The weapons and armor had, of sorts, degenerated, and the fortifications had become cheap wooden walls with houses inside. With the Church’s domination over Europe, everyone was pitted against each other to win favor in the eyes of the Christian God. So with the mix of constant war, Catholic followers were eager and willing to kill their neighbor to earn kudos with the Church. It was a very dangerous, primitive time.

Two of the biggest wars that happened during the Middle Ages were the Crusades and the 100 Year War. Each was a massive series of battles, where thousands died on each side. The weapons never changed much, even though the Middle Ages were over 600 years.

The Crusades and 100 Year War weaponry varied from battle to battle, but they all kept the same basic weapon format. Most of the poorer infantry would use simple iron swords and pikes, simple wooden or iron shields, and, if possible, simple leather armor. The &quot;slingers&quot; or archers would generally have simple slings or short bows. And the typical cavalry would generally have a long sword and shield, and leather or iron armor.

As the Middle Ages continued, weapons became more advanced and more powerful. Swords became stronger and sharper, so the killing of the enemy would be much faster and easier. The English started using longbows instead of small bows so that larger, longer arrows could be shot from a farther distance. Knights wore more flexible armor, so extra movement could give them the upper hand in a battle. Siege weapons became bigger and better, especially because of the invention of European gunpowder, so simple catapults became long-range trebuchets and castle walls became obsolete with the first cannon. Because of these advances, battles, and then wars, became faster and a lot more dangerous.

==Castles and Defense==
A castle is defined as a fortified stronghold or a fortified residence of a lord or other important person. During the Middle Ages, castles were revolutionary in there architecture, impenetrability, and defense capabilities, they were the heart of defense efforts, and the peak of defensive capability for several decades and throughout many wars, including the crusades. They were designed to be safe against charges from cavalry and knights. They were built to withstand long sieges and extended battles. Because of there importance and there reputation as safe havens, castles often employed many staff and housed large amounts of well equipped defense forces, to operate war equipment and fight off attackers. 

A castle is made up of many parts, all vital to its running smoothly. A moat is a ditch dug around a castle, as a fortification, and filled with water to prevent attackers from entering. A drawbridge is a bridge across a deep ditch, often a moat, which may be raised or lowered to restrict or allow entrance into a castle. A portcullis, is a sliding timber or iron gate suspended over a gateway, which can be raised or lowered to allow or prevent access to various areas. They are much like metal doors. Inside a castle are many rooms. There are towers, dungeons, halls, and more. 

==Armor==
After the crusades, weapons started to change more. In fact, a sport was created where you fight for fun. Jousting and tilting were sports where you wore special armor and rode on a horse with a long 14-foot-pole called a lance. The point of the game was to run at the other person making them fall of the horse with your lance. You need to protect yourself with a shield. With the lance, you must thrust into a target on their shoulder. This is extremely thick armor for extra protection. It had poor flexibility and did not look good, but it was extremely strong and weighed from 80-100 pounds. This was one of three kinds of steel armor.

The next kind of armor is decorative armor. It had very good flexibility and looked very fancy. It was not used for fighting but just for decoration. It wasn’t very thick and it weighed from 20-70 pounds. This kind of armor was worn at parades and ceremonies. Only wealthy people wore this. It was very artistic.

The last and most important type of armor was combat armor. It was extremely complicated, though strong, flexible, and it looked good. It consisted of over 200 pieces. It weighed from 45 to 80 pounds. It had built in joints and could be used for any occasion. It was easy to get back on a horse if you fell off with this armor. This armor included a helmet that was properly ventilated and you can see well with it on. 

==The results of the 100 Year War==
Intense Nationalistic feeling grew in both England and France. Most of the war was fought on French soil so there were great population and property loses that weakened France for the next hundred years. England lost territory in France but it allowed the English kings to centralize their power further and concentrate only on the English nobles. New weapons were introduced which weakened the power of the Knights and the castle, thus ensuring the destruction of the feudal system in both England and France. The system continued in many of the Eastern European region especially Russia but was absent in Spain, Portugal, city-states in Inlay, Prussia, and the Holy Roman Empire.

{{User:Whiteknight/Message|1=This page represents an effort of mine to use various tools, including esoteric MediaWiki features and custom Javascripts, to help with creating and editing books. MediaWiki was historically designed for use with Wikipedia, and as such it needs a little creative help to adapt it for use with books and other multi-page information resources. All of the tools on this page require the user to load one or more of my custom javascripts for complete or partial functionality. The first two gadgets, my &quot;Book Creator&quot; and &quot;Template Creator&quot; can be used without Javascript, although some features will be missing.

All these tools are available as a '''gadget''' and can be easily installed on your account. See {{User:Whiteknight/Page3|User:Whiteknight/Javascripts}} for details.

These Gadgets, including the Javascript, Wikitext components, documentation, etc. are released under the terms of the GFDL with no invariant sections, no front cover text and no back cover texts.}}

== About ==

Welcome to my Gadgets page. My gadgets are tools that I've created for helping to automate complex tasks, especially tasks related to creating a new book here on Wikibooks. Gadgets can be viewed and used on the [[User:Whiteknight/Book Creator|Book Creator]] page. The links below will take you to the source code for these gadgets. Documentation is linked to from the Book Creator.

{{TextBox|&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Installation Instructions'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

All stable scripts are now available as Gadgets. Manual install is not necessary. To install my most popular scripts, follow these instructions:
# Go to [[Special:Preferences]]
# Click the '''Gadgets''' tab
# Check the box next to &quot;'''Whiteknight's Visual Book Designer'''&quot;
This will automatically install several scripts, including my '''Visual Book Designer''' and '''Book Creator''' scripts. All scripts, once installed, can be used at the '''[[User:Whiteknight/Book Creator|Book Creator]]''' page. 
}}

=== Status ===

*All scripts are tested to work in '''FireFox 2''' and '''FireFox 3'''.
*Support for '''IE7''' and '''IE6''' is good but not robustly tested. Plus, I have to do some ugly hack work to make these browsers work the same as FireFox. 
*'''Opera''', '''Safari''' and '''Chrome''' should work for most things, but are not regularly tested.

== Main Scripts ==

== NEW BOOK AVAILABLE ==

This new page does not currently exist, and you may start creating a new book here. Here is how to create a new book:
#'''Create your Table of Contents''' (TOC): Edit the textbox below to be the new TOC for your book. Fill in the blank areas, according to the instructions. If your browser supports Javascript and you would like an easier way to do this, consider using [[User:Whiteknight/Book Designer Gadget|Whiteknight's Book Designer Gadget]].
#'''Create your navigation template''': Navigation templates help keep all the pages in your book looking the same. They also help readers quickly navigate between pages. Consider building your new template at {{#ifexist:Template:{{PAGENAME}}/Page| {{#ifexist:Template:{{PAGENAME}} | [[Template:{{PAGENAME}}/Nav]] | [[Template:{{PAGENAME}}/Page]] }} | [[Template:{{PAGENAME}}/Page]]}}. For help, try using Whiteknight's [[User:Whiteknight/Template Creator Gadget|Template Creator Gadget]]. Make sure to include your new template in the TOC, below.
#'''Create your book's category'''. All the pages, templates, and images in your book should belong to the same category, so that they can all stay organized. For ease, your page navigation template should contain your category tag, so that pages will automatically be categorized when you use the template. Consider creating your books's category at {{#ifexist:Category:{{PAGENAME}}| [[:Category:{{PAGENAME}} (Book)]] | [[:Category:{{PAGENAME}}]] }}. For assistance in creating categories, see [[Wikibooks:Categories]], or ask at the [[WB:SLN|New Books Staff Lounge]].

For more information about starting a new book, see [[Help:How to start a book]], and [[User:Whiteknight/New Book Guide|Whiteknight's New Book Guide]]. For questions, ask [[User talk:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] or post a question at the [[WB:SLN|Staff Lounge]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Algebra Page}}

For any [[w:real number|real number]] ''a'' the '''absolute value''' of ''a'' is denoted by |&amp;thinsp;''a''&amp;thinsp;| (a [[w:vertical bar|vertical bar]] on each side of the quantity) and is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;|a| = \begin{cases} a, &amp; \mbox{if }  a \ge 0  \\ -a,  &amp; \mbox{if } a &lt; 0. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

As determined from the above definition, the absolute value of ''a'' is always either [[w:positive number|positive]] or [[w:0 (number)|zero]], but never [[w:negative number|negative]].

From an [[w:analytic geometry|analytic geometry]] point of view, the absolute value of a real number is that number's [[w:distance|distance]] from zero along the [[w:real number line|real number line]], and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them. 

The '''absolute value function''' is a piecemeal function that does nothing to positive numbers, and inverts negative numbers, so it returns all positive numbers.

Absolute value can be expressed as a function: f(x) = |x| = x if x is positive,  = -x if x is negative.  The domain includes all real numbers (absolute value can be expanded to more numbers once we introduce them), and the range is all non-negative numbers (all positive numbers and 0).

This function is the same as asking how far a given number is from zero: both 6 and -6 are 6 units away from zero so |-6| = |6| = 6.

Absolute value can also be used to 'measure' the distance between two numbers: |a-b| would return how many units apart a and b are. Let's use 7 and 9. We intuitively know that 7 is two units away from 9 and 9 is two units away from 7. Here is how we see that with absolute values: |9-7| = |2| = 2   and  |7-9| = |-2| = 2

===Graph===
[[Image:Absolute value.svg|frame|The graph of the absolute value function for real numbers.]]

Absolute value functions graphed exhibit a sharp switch from positive to negative, forming a 'V' shape. 

This is the graph of y = |x|. Notice that the y-values remain positive when the x-values become negative.

==Transformations of the absolute value graph==
[needs more pictures]

===Translations===
A translation of the absolute value function is a shift in a cardinal direction.
Subtraction of a from x (inside the absolute value) will shift the graph a units to the right.
Subtraction of b from y (or addition outside the absolute value sign) will shift the graph b units up.
The graph of y - b = |x - a| is the same as the shown one, except ''a'' units to the right and ''b'' units up.

===Inversion===
A negative sign outside the absolute value sign will 'flip' the graph upside down, so the range of the function is all negative numbers instead of all positive.

===Stretch===
Multiplying the whole function by c will make the &quot;V&quot; wider or narrower. If c is greater than 1, it will be narrower, if c is less than 1 it will be wider.

==Solving Equations with Absolute Value==
To algebraically solve an equation with absolute value, it should be solved with both halves of the piece-mail equation. Solve for the absolute value and replace with +/-. Remember that this will almost always create 'false' solutions, so solutions must be 'checked.'

example:
* |3a - 5| - 6 = 3y - 2
* |3a - 5| = 3y + 4
* 3a - 5 = 3y + 4   or   3a - 5 = -(3y + 4)

From here, two different equations need to be solved:
* 3a - 5 = 3y + 4
* 3y = 3a - 9
* y = a - 3

And the second equation:
* 3a - 5 = -(3y + 4)
* -3y - 4 = 3a - 5
* -3y = 3a - 1
* y = -a + 1/3

We know how to calculate y, but it still depends on what a is.

If 3a - 5 if positive, y = a - 3
* 3a - 5 ≥ 0
* 3a ≥ 5
* a ≥ 5/3

For any value of a ≤ 5/3, y = -a + 1/3

The next example contains an inconsistent equation:
* |2k + 6| + 3 = 0
* |2k + 6| = -3

Here, there is no valid solution since the absolute value can only equal a positive number.  It may appear that you can continue the same operations, but if you check the result, you will discover that the left and right sides will not match.</text>

== Definition of Inequalities ==
As opposed to an equation, an '''inequality''' is an expression that states that two quantities are unequal or not equivalent to one another. In real life we often use inequalities more than equations (i.e. this shirt costs $2 ''more than'' that one).

Given that a and b are real numbers, there are four basic inequalities:

# a &lt; b --&gt; a is &quot;less than&quot; b
#:Example: 2 &lt; 4 ; -3 &lt; 0; etc.
# a &gt; b --&gt; a is &quot;greater than&quot; b
#:Example: -2 &gt; -4 ; 3 &gt; 0 ; etc.
#&lt;math&gt;a \le b&lt;/math&gt; --&gt; a is &quot;less than '''or equal to'''&quot; b
#:Example: If we know that &lt;math&gt;x \le 7&lt;/math&gt;, then we can conclude that x is equal to any value less than 7, including 7 itself.
#&lt;math&gt;a \ge b&lt;/math&gt; --&gt; a is &quot;greater than '''or equal to'''&quot; b
#:Example: Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;x \ge 7&lt;/math&gt;, then x is equal to any value greater than 7, including 7 itself.

== Possible Relationships  ==
A number on the number line is always greater than any number on its left and less than any number on its right. The symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is used to represent &quot;is less than&quot;, and &quot;&lt;math&gt;&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&quot; to represent &quot;is greater than&quot;.

Consider this number line:
&lt;center&gt;[[File:Real Number Line.PNG]]&lt;/center&gt;
From the number line, we can easily tell that 3 is greater than -2, because 3 is on the right side of -2 (or -2 is on the left of 3). We write it as &lt;math&gt;3 &gt; -2&lt;/math&gt;. A teacher in elementary school told me to think of the greater sign as a &quot;greedy mouth&quot;.  The mouth always tries to eat the bigger number.  When I look at the number line I can see that the greater and lesser signs could also represent the arrows at the ends of the number line.  In this case the inequality signs represent arrows that point which direction I have to go to get to the first number from the second number.  If the second number is smaller than the first than I have to move to the right on the number line to go from the second number to the first (which is why the &quot;mouth&quot; points toward the first number).  Similarly if the second number is larger than the first then I have to move to the left on the number line (and the &quot;mouth&quot; now points toward the second number).  I could never remember my teacher's rule of thumb for the &quot;greedy mouth&quot;, but when I thought of the sign as the arrow heads at the end of the line the direction of the operator made sense to me.  How are you going to remember that &quot;&lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is used to represent &quot;is less than&quot;, and &quot;&lt;math&gt;&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&quot; to represent &quot;is greater than&quot;?

Consider a number &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and a constant &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. One and only one of the following statements can be true:
# &lt;math&gt;a &gt; C&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;a = C&lt;/math&gt;, or
# &lt;math&gt;a &lt; C&lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[Wikipedia:Law_of_trichotomy|Law of Trichotomy]]. Another way of describing it is that given a fixed number and a variable the variable can represent numbers smaller than the number, at the same point as the number, or that are larger than the number.  When we create inequalities from words using symbols we know that only one of these statements can be true.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Algebra/Arithmetic/Inequality Word Problems Part I|'''&lt;u&gt;Word Problems&lt;/u&gt;''']]
&lt;/center&gt;
=== Properties ===

There are four important properties with inequalities:
1. Transitive property: For any three numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;x &gt; y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y &gt; z&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x &gt; z&lt;/math&gt;.

2. In an inequality, we can add or subtract the same value from both sides, without changing the sign (i.e. &quot;&lt;math&gt;&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt;&quot;). That is to say, for any three numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;: 
* if &lt;math&gt;x &gt; y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x + p &gt; y + p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x - p &gt; y - p&lt;/math&gt;.

3. We can multiply or divide both sides by a positive number without changing the sign. For example, if we have any two numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and another positive number &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;:
* if &lt;math&gt;x &gt; y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x \times p &gt; y \times p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{p} &gt; \frac{y}{p}&lt;/math&gt;.

4. When we multiply or divide both sides by a negative number, we have to change the sign of the inequality (i.e., &quot;&lt;math&gt;&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&quot; changes to &quot;&lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt;&quot; and vice versa). So if we are given two numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and another negative number &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;
: if &lt;math&gt;x &gt; y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x \times p &lt; y \times p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{p} &lt; \frac{y}{p}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now we can go on to solve any linear inequalities.

== Solving Inequalities ==

Solving inequalities is almost the same as solving linear equations. Let's consider an example: &lt;math&gt;x + 4 &lt; 13&lt;/math&gt;. All we have to do is subtract 4 on both sides. We will then get &lt;math&gt;x &lt; 9&lt;/math&gt;, and that is the answer! Note, however, that what you get is not a single answer, but a set of solutions. Any number that satisfies the condition &lt;math&gt;x &lt; 9&lt;/math&gt; (any number that is less than 9) is a solution to the inequality. It is very convenient to represent the solution using the number line:
&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;-------------------o
 &lt;-+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--&gt;
   6     7     8     9     10    11
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note: the circle(o) shows that the value 9 is not included. Later on, when we deal with less than or equal to and greater than or equal to (≤ and ≥), we use &quot;*&quot; to show that the value is included in the solution set.

Let's try another more complicated question: &lt;math&gt;3x-2 &gt; 2(x-3)&lt;/math&gt;. First, you may want to expand the right hand side: &lt;math&gt;3x-2 &gt; 2x-6&lt;/math&gt;. Then we can simply rearrange so that all the unknowns are on one side (usually the left): &lt;math&gt;3x-2x &gt; -6+2&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, we can easily get the answer: &lt;math&gt;x &gt; -4&lt;/math&gt;.

[[image:Numberlines.png|frame|right|Graphs of inequalities in one variable. The first number line shows x&gt;3, x&lt;-7, and -4&lt;x≤0. The second line shows the disjunction x&lt;-2 or x&gt;2.]]
Here's an example where the direction of the inequality changes when finding the solution: solve &lt;math&gt;4 - 6x &gt; 22&lt;/math&gt;.
* First subtract 4 from both sides: &lt;math&gt;-6x &gt; 18&lt;/math&gt;.
* Now divide through by -6, changing the direction of the inequality: &lt;math&gt;\frac{-6x}{-6} &lt;  \frac{18}{-6}&lt;/math&gt;.
So the solution to the inequality is &lt;math&gt;x &lt; -3&lt;/math&gt;. 


Inequalities, unlike equations, commonly have an infinite number of solutions. 

&lt;math&gt;x &gt; A \!\ &lt;/math&gt; means that x is '''greater than''' A

&lt;math&gt;x &lt; A \!\ &lt;/math&gt; means that x is '''less than''' A


===Special Cases - Multiplying by -1 ===
The rule for multiplying or dividing each side of an inequality by a negative number states that you also need to change the direction of the inequality.  Look at the inequality -1 &lt; 1.  Let's rewrite this generically as -1 op 1, although we know that the operator should be &lt;. Now multiply both sides of the inequality by -1.  You get (-1)*(-1) op (1)*(-1).  Simplifying you get 1 op -1.   For this statement to be true the operator now needs to be &gt;.

If we wanted to we could change multiplying by a negative number into two operations: [(-1)*(Number)][-1 &lt; 1][(Number)*(-1)]. This may seem obvious since we know that all we have to do to get a number to turn into its opposite is multiply by -1.  But, what is it about multiplying by -1 that causes us to have to change the direction of the inequality operator?  If you represent multiplication by the number 1 on a number line you see that all you do is move x(the number you are multiplying) units to the ''right'' of zero.

'''&lt;u&gt;TODO: Need Graphic&lt;/u&gt;'''

Similarly, if you represent multiplication by the number -1 on a number line you see that you need to move x(the number you are multiplying) units to the ''left'' of zero.

'''&lt;u&gt;TODO: Need Graphic&lt;/u&gt;'''

Now think about the difference between an equality and an inequality.  If you know that x = y is true then you also know that x-y = 0.   If you know that x &gt; y then you know two things: that x - y &gt; 0 (bigger - smaller is positive) and also that y - x &lt; 0 (smaller - bigger is negative). If we multiply x &gt; y by 1 we still get x &gt; y.  If we move y to the left side of the equation by subtracting y from both sides we get x - y &gt; 0.   Which we know is true.  On the other hand when we multiply x &gt; y by -1 and don't change the direction of the inequality we get -x &gt; -y.  When we move the y to the left side of the equation by adding y to both sides we get y - x &gt; 0.  Which we know is not true.  In the previous step when we needed to say -x &lt; -y because even though both numbers are negative, -x is further to the left, and therefore smaller, than -y.

Working algebra problems can become automatic, but it is important for you to keep in mind why the rules are true so that you can catch yourself if you accidentally forget part of a rule.

===Special Cases - Inequalities with a variable in the denominator===

For example consider the inequality 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{x-1}&lt;2\,&lt;/math&gt;

In this case one cannot multiply the right hand side by (x-1) because the value of x is unknown.  Since x may be either positive or negative, you can't know whether to leave the inequality sign as &lt;, or reverse it to &gt;.
The method for solving this kind of inequality involves four steps:
# Find out when the denominator is equal to 0.  In this case it's when &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;.
# Pretend the inequality sign is an = sign and solve it as such: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{x-1}=2\,&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;x=2&lt;/math&gt;.
# Plot the points &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=2&lt;/math&gt; on a number line with an unfilled circle because the original equation included a &lt; sign (note that it would have been a filled circle if the original equation included &lt;= or &gt;=).  You now have three regions which are separated by unfilled circles. These regions are: &lt;math&gt;x&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1&lt;x&lt;2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;x&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;.
# Test each region independently.  in this case test if the inequality is true for 1&lt;x&lt;2 by picking a point in this region (e.g. x=1.5) and trying it in the original inequation.  For x=1.5, the original inequality doesn't hold.  Now, attempt x&gt;2 (e.g. x=3).  In this case the original inequation holds, and so the solution for the original inequation is x&gt;2.

===Special Cases - Going back to equality ===


&lt;math&gt;x \ge A&lt;/math&gt; means that x is '''greater than or equal to''' A

&lt;math&gt;x \le A&lt;/math&gt; means that x is '''less than or equal to''' A</text>

== An Overview of The Pythagorean Theorem ==
[[Image:Pythagorasanimation.gif|right|frame]]

The first expressions for mathematics were closer to Geometry than to Algebra, and the Greeks were the first people to study mathematics for its own sake, leading to generalized theories and proofs.  A Greek mathematician named Euclid wrote a book called [[w:Euclidean geometry|&quot;The Elements&quot;]] that presented Geometry as a logical system derived from 5 Axioms or givens and 5 &quot;common sense&quot; assertions about logic.

In the Euclid's Elements Proposition 47 is the [[w:Pythagorean Theorem|Pythagorean Theorem]] which states &quot;In any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse  (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).&quot;  This is quite a mouthful, but as we will see below in algebra we can write it as &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2=c^2&lt;/math&gt;. The animation to the right shows an animation of Euclid's proof for Proposition 47.

The article on the [[w:Pythagorean Theorem|Pythagorean Theorem]] shows several other approaches to prove the Pythagorean Theorem including one that was published by the future President of the United States James Garfield in 1876!

Integers that conform to the theorem are called [[w:Pythagorean Triples|Pythagorean Triples]], which we will soon address.  A [[w:Plimpton 322| clay tablet]] shows that Pythagorean triplets were being documented almost 4000 years ago, 1,000 years before Pythagoras.  One archaeologist theorizes that the tablet might have been a problem set a teacher assigned a student.

==The Distance Formula - Using The Pythagorean Theorem In Algebra ==
Let's say that there are two dots on a coordinate plane. How would you find the distance between the two without a ruler? Hint: draw a right triangle. Let's see if you can figure this out yourself before peeking!

Suppose you have two points, (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and suppose that the length of the straight line between them is d. You can derive the distance formula by noticing that you can follow the following path between any two points to obtain a right triangle: start at point 1, change x (keep y constant) until you're directly above or below point 2, and then alter y and keep x constant until you're at point 2.

{{todo|This could use a diagram to point out what is said here}}

If you follow this path, the length of the first segment that you draw is &lt;math&gt; |x_2 - x_1| &lt;/math&gt; and the length of the second is &lt;math&gt; |y_2 - y_1| &lt;/math&gt;. Also, since these two line segments form a right triangle, the Pythagorean Theorem applies and we can write &lt;math&gt;(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 = d^2\, &lt;/math&gt; or, solving for d,

{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;math&gt;d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
{{TrigBoxClose}}

This formula is called the '''distance formula'''.

Another Formula is (and more simplified):

{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2=c^2&lt;/math&gt;
{{TrigBoxClose}}

==Pythagorean Triples==
If there exist three positive integers who are sides of a right triangle (the sum of the squares of the 2 smaller integers is equal to the square of the largest), then the three numbers are called Pythagorean Triples. Common triples include:

3-4-5

5-12-13

7-24-25

8-15-17

12-35-37

20-21-29

Note: If the three numbers a-b-c are a Pythagorean Triple, then all subsequent multiples of this Triple will satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem.

&lt;/center&gt;

Not all numbers create a Pythagorean Triple.  In fact if you connect the corners of a square on a Cartesian grid you've just drawn a line that has an irrational length.  &lt;math&gt; 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 &lt;/math&gt; so the length of the line is &lt;math&gt; \sqrt 2 &lt;/math&gt;.  It is said that the Greek mathematician who proved this, [[w:Hippasus|Hippasus]] was thrown off a ship and drowned for proving that the &lt;math&gt; \sqrt 2 &lt;/math&gt; was irrational.

The Wikipedia article on [[w:Pythagorean_triple|Pythagorean Triples]] shows mathematical research on Pythagorean Triples.  If you follow the links on the article you will find that modern mathematicians are still finding new patterns with them. Even if you don't find Pythagorean triples interesting for their own sake, it is worth memorizing the first set: 3-4-5.  You are likely to encounter these numbers on standardized tests or in word problems.  After you leave school you will find opportunities to use these lengths to quickly test whether an angle you are looking at is square.</text>

== Relative links within books ==

G'day, just a little note about linking to other pages within your book. You can link to a sub-page of a page by putting a slash before and after the page name in the link, like this: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Table1/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If you want to link to a sister page (i.e. a page at the same level in the chapter hierarchy), you can put &lt;code&gt;../&lt;/code&gt; in front of the page name, like this: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[../Sister page/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. To link to a sister of a parent page, put another &lt;code&gt;../&lt;/code&gt; in front of that, like this: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[../../Parent's sister page/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. See [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Contemporary_Educational_Psychology%2FChapter_1%3A_The_Changing_Teaching_Profession_and_You%2FProfessionalism_of_Teachers&amp;diff=936415&amp;oldid=936313 here] for the changes I made to one of your pages, for an example. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:58, 4 August 2007 (UTC)

== Re: New Book Tag ==

No, you dont need to do anything. The tag serves only as a reminder that the book is new. It puts the book into the &quot;New Books&quot; category, so that it doesnt get lost. The only thing that you need to make sure of, is that you properly categorize your book before you remove the new book tag from it. If you have that part done, then you are home free. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:51, 20 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

'''Compound Inequalities''' are two inequalities presented as one problem. The variable being solved for may need to only fulfill only one of the inequalities, or both, depending on if the word &quot;and&quot; or &quot;or&quot; is used. There may be many correct answers, or even none at all.

Example: 2x - 4 &amp;gt; 2 or 30/x &amp;gt; 15

* 2x &amp;gt; 6 or 30 &amp;gt; 15x
*  x &amp;gt; 3 or x &amp;lt; 2

The answer can then be graphed as two rays on a number line.

[[Image:NumberlineL2G3.png|450px|Figure 1]]

If we are interested in real solutions we can pick numbers barely smaller 2 or hardly greater than 3 as we want and the equation will be true.  For instance if x =1.99 then 30/x = 15.08 (satisfies 30/x &amp;gt; 15) or if x = 3.01 then 2x-4 = 2.02 (satisfies 2x -4 &amp;gt; 2).

If we are only interested in integer solutions than we can see that all the integers except for 2 or 3 will work.

We can also express a compound inequality as a function.

If we specify a function f(x) = (x &amp;gt; 3 or  x &amp;lt; 2) we get a graph like this:

[[Image:Linel2g3xy.png|300px|Figure 2]]

The solution is still two rays.  But now the rays are on the line y=x, with one ray moving to the right and up from the number 3 and the other moving left and down from the number 2.  

Exercise:  Using the concept of slope, can you explain why a figure transferred from a number line to a Cartesian graph will always be displayed on the line y=x? 

=== How can I use Compound Inequalities? ===
==== Example: Highway and City Gas Mileage ====

The gas mileage sticker on cars gives two numbers: one for city driving, and one for highway driving.  If a sticker says the car gets 25 mpg in the city and 32 mpg on the highway how far can you drive?

In order to find this out I need to know how much gas I have in my tank.  I know that I can drive between 25 and 32 miles with a single gallon of gas.  I can represent this with two equations where x = how far I can drive on a gallon of gas:

25 &lt; x  and x &lt; 32.

Or I can combine them into a compound inequality:

25 &lt; x &lt; 32.

If I have a 10 gallon gas tank, and I want to know how far I can drive I change the equation to represent the 10 gallons of gas I have in my tank by multiplying each term in the compound inequality by 10.

25 * 10 &lt; 10*x &lt; 32 * 10.

250 &lt; 10x &lt; 320.

I can drive between 250 and 320 miles on a single tank of gas.

==== Example: Conversions ====

The conversion formula for Fahrenheit to Celsius is 5/9(F - 32).

We know that water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit and boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.  

If we want to know the freezing point and boiling point of water in Celsius we could set the equation up as follows:

32 &lt; F &lt; 212

And then apply the formula to convert the values in degrees F to degrees C.

5/9(32-32) &lt; C &lt; 5/9(212 - 32)

So water freezes and boils at:

0 &lt; C &lt; 100

=== Absolute Value ===

What happens when we need to multiply by x?

Remember that subtraction is equivalent to adding a negative number, and multiplication is the same as adding a number multiple times.  So when we add a negative number multiple times the result keeps getting smaller.  When solving a problem using inequalities we need to decide if the context of the problem makes sense for negative numbers.  

A special type of compound inequality involves the absolute value sign. The absolute value sign specifies two functions such that f(x)=A implies f(-x) = (-A)(-1).  For the equal sign this is the same as f(x)=f(-x)=A.  But when we use an inequality sign and we multiply by a negative number we have to switch the direction of the sign.  So if f(x) &amp;gt; A then f(-x) &amp;lt; A.

This is simple when the only the value of x is in the absolute value sign.  For instance given|x| &amp;gt; 12 then the possible solutions are x &amp;gt; 12 or -x &amp;lt; -12.

Example - convert |6x + 18| - 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;gt; 9 into a compound inequality.

*|6x + 18| &amp;gt; 36
*6x + 18 &amp;gt; 36 or 6x + 18 &amp;lt; -36
*6x &amp;gt; 18 or 6x &amp;lt; -54
*x &amp;gt; 3 or x &amp;lt; -8

=== How can you use absolute value? ===
'''Example 1'''

A good way to use absolute value is to determine if your previous estimates are right.

For instance, given your car that gets between 25 and 32 miles per gallon.  If you want to make sure my car is running well you should keep track of my mileage using the formula:

&lt;math&gt;25 &lt; \left | m / g \right \vert &lt; 32 \ &lt;/math&gt; when m = (miles at last fillup - miles at the pump) and g = amount of fuel I just pumped.

If m/g is not greater than 25 than you should make sure your car is running properly.  If m/g is over 32 maybe someone is putting extra gas in your car!

'''Example 2 - Think like a teacher!'''

You give five tests in a quarter.  A student has made scores of 80 , 90, and a 80 on the first three tests.  The student asks you for a chance for extra credit.  Should you give the student the chance?

To get a B for the quarter the student needs to make 80*5 = 400.  To get an A for the quarter the student needs to get a 450.  If we let X equal the student's scores on the last two tests we can see

400 &lt; 250 + x &lt; 450

150 &lt; x &lt; 180

The average score for the last two tests will be x/2.  So dividing the equation above by 1/2 we get 75 &lt; x &lt; 90.  Since the average score until now is about 83 the student would be encouraged to study harder for the final two tests with just a few extra credit points.</text>

== Preamble ==

Installing SPM on Windows 64 bit (XP, Vista, 7, 8) should be straightforward. There are pitfalls common to all versions of SPM:

* It is not recommended to install SPM in MATLAB's toolbox folder as MATLAB toolbox directories can be cached and changes in SPM files (such as updates) might not appear when using SPM. See [http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab_env/f8-28521.html Toolbox Path Caching] and [http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/rehash.html rehash]

* If you get errors regarding &quot;gui_mainfcn&quot;, you have to reset your MATLAB path (probably following an installation of a new MATLAB release), use the button &quot;Default&quot; in File &gt; Set Path. See also [http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/matlab_env/br7ppws-1.html#br8p4gj-1 restoredefaultpath].

* If you use [http://www.winzip.com/ WinZip] to unpack SPM's *.tar.gz archives, make sure to uncheck &quot;Tar file smart CR/LF conversion&quot;, which is under the &quot;miscellaneous&quot; tab in &quot;configuration&quot; under &quot;options&quot;, as it could corrupt some of SPM files otherwise. [http://www.7-zip.org/ 7-Zip] is a good open source software alternative.

* If you see garbled text or incorrect characters in the interface, you have to change your ''system locale'' so that it matches your ''user locale''. See [http://www.mathworks.co.uk/help/matlab/matlab_env/how-the-matlab-process-uses-locale-settings.html How the MATLAB process uses locale settings] and [http://www.mathworks.co.uk/help/matlab/matlab_env/setting-the-locale.html#brkh9v3-1 Setting the locale]. If problems persist, try the instructions detailed at the end of this page.
* If you have an error &quot;Where is spm_check_version.m?&quot;, make sure not to start SPM when your MATLAB current directory is ''C:\Windows\system32'' and not to have this directory in your MATLAB path. See [http://www.mathworks.co.uk/support/solutions/en/data/1-5JUPSQ/ MathWorks support].

== SPM12 ==

=== Installation ===

* Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html spm12.zip].
* Unzip spm12.zip in a folder of your choice, such as C:\Users\''login''\Documents\MATLAB\spm12).
* Start MATLAB and add SPM into your path, either using ''File &gt; Set Path &gt; Add Folder...'' or typing
 &gt;&gt; addpath C:\Users\''login''\Documents\MATLAB\spm12
in MATLAB's workspace.
* Launch SPM by typing
 &gt;&gt; spm

=== Update ===

If you have just downloaded the spm12.zip archive, it already contains the latest set of updates.
To update SPM when a new version is released:
* Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/download/spm12_updates/ spm12_updates_rxxxx.zip]
* Unzip spm12_updates_rxxxx.zip on top of the folder containing your SPM installation so that newer files overwrite existing files.
Alternatively, you can use the spm_update.m function:
 &gt;&gt; spm_update
If a new version is available, it can be applied to your local installation by typing:
 &gt;&gt; spm_update update

=== Compilation ===

Precompiled MEX files (*.mexw64) are provided with SPM12 and you shouldn't need to recompile them by yourself.

== Troubleshooting ==

If text still appears garbled in the interface after changing the system locale, try the following:
 cd(spm('Dir'))
 load spm_Menu.fig -mat
 hgS_070000.properties.DefaulttextFontName='Arial Narrow';
 hgS_070000.properties.DefaultuicontrolFontName='Arial Narrow';
 save spm_Menu.fig hgS_070000 -v6
 load spm_Welcome.fig -mat
 hgS_070000=spm_changepath(hgS_070000,'Helvetica','Arial Narrow');
 save spm_Welcome.fig hgS_070000 -v6

 set(0,'defaultTextFontName','Arial Narrow') 
 set(0,'defaultUicontrolFontName','Arial Narrow') 

Edit spm/matlabbatch/private/cfg_mlbatch_defaults.m and modify lines:
 cfg_defaults.cfg_ui.lfont.FontName   = 'Arial Narrow';
 cfg_defaults.cfg_ui.bfont.FontName   = 'Arial Narrow';

== Building a Circle ==
A circle is defined as the set of points that are a fixed distance from a center point.  This definition is expressed in the way we draw circles.  We pick a point as the center and then use some mechanical means to rotate a drawing utensil around that point.  Of course our drawings are always approximations of the shape we think of as a circle.  Drawings are only as accurate as the hardness and thickness of our tools will allow.  For instance if you blow the drawing below up large enough on your computer screen you might see it is composed of adjacent colored squares and rectangles on your screen.  If you used software that maintained the scale of the points as you magnified the circle then eventually it would start to look like a line.  This is the reason that we perceive roads as being straight even though we know the Earth is round.

[[Image:CircleRadii.PNG|324px|thumb|left|A circle with radii at the integer X and Y coordinates]]
Still using this drawing 
We know that the equation for distance is   &lt;math&gt;d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}&lt;/math&gt;.  To make the calculations easy let's let point &lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1) = (0,0) &lt;/math&gt;.  



As you likely have learned before, a '''circle''' is defined as any set of points that is a fixed distance (the '''radius''') from a fixed point (the '''center'''). To find a formula for this, suppose that the center is 
the point (a,b). According to the distance formula, the distance c from the point (a,b) to any other point (x, y) is:

&lt;math&gt; c^2 = (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

By definition, a circle is the set of ''all points for a given value of c''. We call this r and come up with the following equation for a circle:

{{box|A circle with center (''a'', ''b'') and radius ''r'' is the set of all points (''x'', ''y'') such that
&lt;math&gt;
\left( x - a \right)^2 + \left( y - b \right)^2=r^2.
&lt;/math&gt;}}

[[Image:Ellipse Animation Small.gif|right]]
[[Image:Ellipse axis.png|right]]
An ellipse is the collection of points that are equidistant from two points, called ''foci'' (singular ''focus'').

The foci are found on the '''major axis''', which has a length of 2a. The '''minor axis''' is 2b, and is smaller.

The &quot;roundness&quot; or &quot;longness&quot; of an ellipse can be measured by eccentricity. If c is the distance from the center to a focus, then e = c / a.

The '''latus rectum''' is a line parallel to the minor axis that crosses through a focus. Its length is b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / a.

&quot;Long&quot; ellipses are generally written as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(x-h)^{2}}{a^{2}} + \frac{(y-k)^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

where (h,k) is the center, while &quot;tall&quot; ellipses are written as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(y-k)^{2}}{a^{2}} + \frac{(x-h)^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;</text>

I hope this is a positive contribution. I want this book to be completed. 
&lt;p&gt;
There are 23 civilizations, and 8 questions per civilization. Let's give 2 points for full information, 1 point for a few sentences per question. I will use first three letters as code of civilization.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sections more than 1/2 completed:&lt;/b&gt; Azt (16/16), Egy (12/16), Ind (9/16), Mou (10/16), May (12/16), Rom (9/16), Ved (14/16)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Percent completed in this category:&lt;/b&gt; 75%
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sections started:&lt;/b&gt; Akk (3), Aks (2), Bab (3), Chi (1), Inc (0), Jap (3), Per (3)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Percent completed in this category:&lt;/b&gt; 14%
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Total completion on all started sections:&lt;/b&gt; 44%! 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sections NOT started&lt;/b&gt;: Ana, His, Ass, Gre, Heb, Khm, Pre, Pue, Sum
&lt;p&gt;
I agree with Rob's suggestion that &quot;it would be better to research one civilization and make it well written&quot;... I think we should focus first on the sections more than 1/2 completed. Once they are all completed, we could then pick half of the started sections. Of course, any experts in an area would be welcome to fill in an entire civilization, but I know for me, this is mostly research, not personal knowledge.

==Size==
Is this Wikijunior project going to be 48 pages like Wikijunior: Solar System? I think it'll be even easier to fill that requirement with this project, eapecially if we add more civilizations--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 16:56, 25 August 2005 (UTC)

:The original &quot;goal&quot; of Wikijunior, at least suggested on the Meta side, was that about every other month a new &quot;Wikibook&quot; would be formally published and paid for by the Beck Foundation.  I've been pushing it here to &quot;expand&quot; the number of Wikijunior books, but it appears as though this Wikijunior book is going to be at least as successful as the other ones, with just as much content as the Solar System book if not more.  I am proposing (like I have at the Solar System book) that we &quot;select&quot; some of the best articles for formal publication to fit the 48 page book requirment, but that we also allow some &quot;breathing room&quot; on the Wiki side and allow substantial lattitude on the length of the content.  It certainly is easier to reduce down to 48 pages than it is to expand content up to that length, as might be the case for the Big Cats Wikibook.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:22, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

::I definitely agree. Over on Solar System, even though I started some of the articles on the different moons, I would be horrified if they actually went into the print version. For some of them, there's just not that much info to be found for now :(

::Do you have any ideas on the process of picking the best articles? Will it be a simple vote, or are we going to try to involve experts in the process?--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 04:29, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

:::Since it hasn't been done yet for any Wikibook, your guess is as good as mine.  I'm trying to dig up some info from the people who are in on the Beck Foundation grant, but the &quot;earliest&quot; that anything was supposed to be published was December 2005.  That &quot;deadline&quot; is coming up, so things might start moving before then.  I'm trying to keep the heat on and see that this project moves forward.  I like the community vote thing, where you can vote on the articles that you like, and the top vote getters (with some tie breaker for the last ones out) get published, at least for the current &quot;version&quot; that goes out.&lt;p&gt;As far as involving &quot;experts&quot; in the process, I have a personal aversion to the concept as preached by the Nupedia crowd, and it goes to show you how far Nupedia has gone to see what that brought.  At the same time, putting content through a more formal &quot;review&quot; process of people well versed in the topic, including formal &quot;experts&quot; in the field, would have some merit once we have built the basic foundation of the article.  I also think that learned &quot;laymen&quot; who have studied the topic certainly can make valuable contributions, and Wikipedia is a classical example of what can be accomplished if you let them.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:15, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

== African civilizations ==

&lt;p&gt;I am sorry if this is the wrong place to post, someone please feel free to move or tell me where this would be more appropriate. Reviewing the list of ancient civilizations I noticed many African civilizations missing. Here is a graphic to reference:
http://www.inmotionaame.org/gallery/detail.cfm?migration=1&amp;topic=1&amp;id=1_001M&amp;type=map
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I do not know the names of these civilizations, but I will type in a few of their geographic locations and time periods below:&lt;br&gt;
Kingdom of Kush, ~1000 BC to ~400AD&lt;br&gt;
Kingdom of Axum, ~1AD to ~750AD&lt;br&gt;
Empire of Ghana, ~250AD to ~1100AD&lt;br&gt;
Empire of Mali, ~1200AD to ~1500AD&lt;br&gt;
Kingdom of Benin, ~1200AD to ~1800AD&lt;br&gt;
Kingdom of Oyo, ~1200AD to ~1700AD&lt;br&gt;
and so on...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It would be my intention to answer as many of the &quot;major questions&quot; as possible. &lt;br&gt;
--[[User:Benbakelaar|Benbakelaar]] 22:52, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
&lt;/p&gt;

:I'm not as familiar with ancient African civilizations other than Egypt as perhaps I should.  This would be a good opportunity to try and introduce some of those civilizations, but try to keep in mind this is more for empires rather than single tribal groups or single city-states.  The only reason for that &quot;provision&quot; is to try and weed out some of the minor civilizations or distinctions like between Troy and Athens, which would more easily be covered in a general topic of the Greek civilization instead.  I don't know how many African civilizations this would cover, but I do know of historical groups in Africa, like those mentioned above, would be welcome additions.

:Keep in mind this is going to be a book for kids, so try to find a topic that may be media-rich in content as well.  Many photos, perhaps some music from the culture, and information about a civlization that at least covers the &quot;standard&quot; set of questions.  I know of some archeological research that has covered Zimbabwe dating back traditional governments and societies going back centuries or even millenia that would be facinating.  Particularly because the architechtural styles are so unique to that part of Africa and different from the rest of the world.  Seperate walkways and paths were made for royalty and nobility as opposed to ordinary workers in the city, for instance, have a significant impact on the structure of the cities, where the royalty couldn't even be seen by ordinary people, to give an example.

:Don't go overboard on adding blank names for more civlizations.  It would be better to research one particular civilization and make it well written rather than simply going everywhere and writing a couple of sentances about everything.  If you want to pick a particular African civilization and write about it in depth, that would be especially encouraged.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:38, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

::Thanks for that information. I will attempt to discern the major from the minor, and perhaps choose just one as a representative example! --[[User:Benbakelaar|Benbakelaar]] 12:41, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

:::I just came here to mention the lack of African Civilizations. I added the Axum kingdom some time ago (I found it spelled as Aksum though), but I'm not sure how major or minor the civilization was.--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 18:35, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

==The Aryans==
Reading the list of civilizations I noticed that the Aryans was missing. True they didn't create an Empire but they did make significant contributions to the religions, languages and cultures of those that did. Any reason for this or can I go ahead and add them to the list?  
~~Tina~~Saturday, March 11th, 2006

:Due to its connection with National Socialism (Nazis) and Facism, this can be (unfortunately) a rather charged political topic.  If this were the 1930's it would have been incredibly charged politically, but there still are some Neo-Nazi groups that might try to inject their $0.02 into something of this nature.  Read everything with a very jandiced eye if you look at anything regarding this civilization, especially if the literature references material from or stuff written during the 1920's and 1930's heavily, or worse stuff that was written in the 1940's.  Legitimate archeological and scholarly research that has been done in the past couple of decades will likely be more rational with how this civilization is portrayed, and it would be an interesting topic to bring up.  Feel free to add this civilization to the list if you can find content that could flesh this topic out.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:02, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

Never thought of the neo-nazi angle. I'll think this through before I do anything. Thanks for pointing it out to me.

== Who Lives There Today? ==

In the cases of the Hellenic, Roman, Egyptian, Persian, Indian, and Chinese civilizations, the people who live there today trace their lineage to the citizins of the ancient empires, speak a language related to that of their famous ancestors, and are well aware of the empires and the effects they had on their part of the world.

This is as much the case for civilizations that were overrun by outsiders (like the moundbuilders) or which receded into the mists of time (as with the Mayans).  In the Moundbuilders module, I had included a &quot;who lives there now&quot; section to talk about the fact that the people who live there now often have no idea their city was built on top of a Moundbuilder town.

Someone deleted this section, probably because it does not adhere to the outline set out for the entire book.  I put it back, because I think this is an interesting fact.  It is still a &quot;stub section&quot;, which would benefit from a short list of famous North American cities built on top of moundbuilder towns.

I also added a &quot;who lives there now&quot; section for the Roman civilization, as an example of how different the information is.

Maybe this information should be incorporated into &quot;What is left of them?&quot;.
I know it is dangerous to introduce a NEW CLASS OF INFORMATION to a book that just needs to get finished.  But this information is useful to understanding the world we live in today.  

If you travel to Egypt, you will find plenty of people on the street who know about the language, history, and religion of ancient Egypt as well as shops selling trinkets representing same.  If you travel in the lands formerly occupied by Moundbuilders, you will have to search hard to find anyone with knowledge of or trinkets representing the Moundbuilders.  --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 15:26, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

:Thank you SV, and there are several civilizations in North America where this is true, such as the Pueblo and the Anastazi.  I'm trying to imagine similar situations that have existed in other places, but it is hard to come up with developed civilizations with trading networks, imperial alliances, and common culture and heritage to be called a &quot;civilization&quot; that has been overrun.  Perhaps some in Africa, and in Europe there have been some nations that have been overrun completely but there are a few stragglers left behind.  Much of the 20th/21st century has been the reemergence/reestablishment of ancient civilizations where they were previously considered a colony of another nation or a deliberately repressed group.  Compare the number of countries in the year 1900 compared to 2000 and you might get a glimpse of how dramatic this in fact has been.

:The major driving force in North America has really been a massive depopulation of the continent due to disease and climate shifts.  Some substantial cooling of the climates throughout the world, but particularly in North America, occured between 1400 and 1800.  Nowhere is this more clear than in Greenland where an established Viking colony was completely abandoned from a peak population of about 100,000 people.  European diseases such as Small Pox, Chicken Pox, Horse Flu, and others also had a compounding effect, together with meeting invading European peoples carrying firearms and steel implements that made realistic competition impossible.  All of these social &quot;forces&quot; resulted in genuine wilderness being at locations that were previously major cities.  Most dramatic of all in regards to large populations going into depopulated wilderness than the valley of the Great Salt Lake, where had Mormon settlers had any sort of resistance from native peoples they would have simply moved on or even died.  Due to drought and crop disease there was litterally nobody living in the area that now is a major city of over one million people.  Similar stories could be told about other areas, including Los Angeles, where even a Spanish settlement died out due to drought, disease, and famine.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:00, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

== Civil? How were they civil? ==

Can someone explain to me how they were civil, unless we are going to call murder/wars/etc all civil, I don't think we can call them civilized. This only applies to some of them, some were and are still civilized. [[User:220.233.48.200|220.233.48.200]] 12:22, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

:I'm not sure what you mean. --[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 12:39, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

:The Latin root from which civilization derives is ''cīvīlis'', meaning &quot;pertaining to citizens, their private rights and so forth [source: ''OED''].&quot; The term (sadly) has little to do with being civil in the broader sense suggested above.  In short, any culture sufficiently organized to have some rudimentary legal structures and other institutions for governing commerce and other relevant civil (rather than martial) activities -- tends to qualify as a &quot;civilization.&quot;  At least that seems to be a fairly well-entrenched definition.  --[[User:Ebbixx|bud]] 03:48, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

More to be added later.--[[User:Konstable|Konstable]] 07:05, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

== Timeline suggestion and Time Period Question ==

A timeline showing a comparison of where each culture was at specific times would be good to add. Too often the individual cultures get separated in the instruction and the big picture of what was going on with humanity globally gets lost.

What time period is being used to define &quot;ancient&quot;? I see cultures listed that are not necessarily considered ancient. Both the Vikings and the Pueblos are good examples. My understanding is that &quot;ancient&quot; defines prehistory to approximately the Greek Dark Age, but is frequently studied combined with the classical ages to the fall of the Roman Empire, so dawn of civilization until approximately 400ce. There are groups listed here who were at their height much later than that. While this may sound picky, I know my 9yo would pick up on it quickly. Also I think the standard conventions should be used. Randomly calling a group ancient just because they are &quot;old&quot; does not add to the projects credibility.

== BC/AD versus BCE/CE ==

There has been a bit of an edit conflict recently between people who beleive we should be using the BCE/CE notation for telling time, as opposed to the more common BC/AD convention. I personally say that we should use the BC/AD convention, because it is more common, children are more likely to be familiar with it, and if we use a foreign notation, we will have to explain the political and religious motivations behind the change. I feel like this is an unnecessary diversion for children, although I can certainly understand the attitude that we should &quot;start children off right&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:58, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

As a history teacher, I find that even my ninth grade students are still unclear about what is meant by BC/AD, ''and'' BCE/CE.  Can we add in a piece in the introduction, and explain both sets of terms in a few sentences?  It's a tricky thing to explain to a kid that years move ''backwards'' once you've moved back in time 2,005 years, but it goes (3.. 2... 1... 1... 2... 3... [...] 2006...) and so on.
How about...
::: Students of history count years in many systems, but the system most commonly used in English is the BC/AD dating system invented by an English scholar named Bede in the 8th century AD.  Bede was a Christian, so AD stands for ''Anno Domini'' which means &quot;Year of the Lord,&quot; and counts the number of years since the ''birth'' of Jesus Christ, which Bede thought was the most important event in the history of the world.  So, BC stands for ''Before Christ''.  As you will learn from reading this book, though, not all English-speakers are Christian.  Some teachers and students today use exactly the same dating system that Bede invented, but they substitue the letters CE for AD.  CE means ''Common Era''.  These scholars also use BCE instead of BC, to mean ''Before Common Era''.  The dates in BC and AD notation are ''exactly the same'' as BCE and CE notation, but BCE and CE are intended to be more friendly to history students who may not be Christian.  In both systems, there is no Year 0, like in a number line in math class.  Instead, numbers work like this:  BCE/BC years 3 - 2 - 1 -- 1 - 2 - 3 -  CE/AD.... and so on up to our own time of 2006 on the CE/AD side.  This means that Bede lived in the 8th century CE.

Maybe this helps, maybe it doesn't.  I'm new to the project, so I don't know if this fits or not, though my own preference is for BCE/CE with an explanation.  -[[User:Andrew Watt|Andrew Watt]] 02:24, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

:I agree with Andrew (except I believe it was Dionysius Exiguus who came up with the dating system). Children don't really have a system that they're really set on, and using BCE/CE now will prepare them for when they encounter it later in text books and other academic publications where BCE/CE predominate. The popularity of BCE/CE is also rising in general usage, and it would not make sense to use an archaic system which is on the decline. For example, it would be far better to use and teach metric, rather than imperial, units, even though I and many other still &quot;think&quot; and feel more comfortable with imperial units, and even though imperial units may currently be more popular. Like it or not metric is the way of the future, just like BCE/CE.

::I believe the style adopted by any Wikibook should reflect that which its target audience expects, wants or requires. For example, a textbook on GCSE Mathematics would be written in British English, using terms the average British 15 or 16 year old would know or would have to learn as part of that syllabus. A textbook on US History written for GCSE History would adopt a similar style, whereas a textbook on US History written for American adults would use American English, perhaps use longer, more complicated words and clauses, and may assume knowledge that every American schoolchild (but not every British schoolchild) knows. Only where this determinant is not decisive (such as, should a book on US History written for a worldwide audience be in American or British English) should other factors (usually what style the authors happen to find easiest to write in) be taken into account. It would be useful for other Wikibookians to comment on whether they agree with this approach, and if not what approach they would take instead and why.

::Adopting the 'let the target audience determine the style' approach, I ask here, what is the target audience of this book? This is easily answered - it is a general worldwide audience of children aged 8 to 12.

::I now go on to consider that audience in the specific case. BCE/CE notation, according to Encarta (and as far as I can tell backed up by google searches) is favoured in texts where there is a predominantly Jewish audience with Jewish writers and/or a Jewish audience. It also appears favoured by some academics at some universities - in some cases this is most academics in a given university, and the terminology appears to be comparatively more favoured in the United States and by Americans overseas than others. However, broadly speaking, those not fitting that description (and this class makes up the overwhelming majority of the world's population) prefer BC/AD notation. In numerical terms, over 90%+ prefer BC/AD notation. It's also worth noting that there has been resistance amongst the worldwide general public to the introduction of BCE/CE notation, even on a limited scale - only last month the Governor of Kentucky personally intervened to stop a state education board proposal to adopt BCE/CE, with comments that the Governor did this so as not to harm re-election chances later this year; changing just one instance of BC to BCE in one New South Wales exam paper (plus adding an explanation that BCE was equivalent to BC) was enough to provoke angry questions in both chambers of the New South Wales parliament. There have been other negative reactions in Canada and England when there have been other smallscale attempts to introduce the terms to a general audience. I mention this not to invite comment on whether we believe the reactions were justified or not, but instead to note that, if we are writing a history book for a general audience, there are very good reasons why we should only use BC/AD terminology: Not everybody prefers the notation, but the overwhelming majority of the target audience does (and many actively dislike the alternative).

::I would note, however, that if we had a textbook targeted at an audience that overwhelming uses BCE/CE notation, such as a textbook targeted at a Jewish audience, the conclusion here, quite rightly in my opinion, would be that it would be perverse to use BC/AD notation for that textbook.

::Andrew does raise another good point. Would it be worth including in this book, towards the start, some explanation of what BC actually means (maybe also coupled with a note as to why many dates in the book are necessarily approximations)? I think I'd agree that it would be useful - those unsure of the dating system can then learn it, those already familiar with it can skip that section (though I note that I would not favour Andrew's example explanation of it, which seems too technical for what is essentially a brief aside to explain a key term), [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 20:37, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

:The BCE/CE system was created as an attempt to not make the calendar system so completely dependant on jesus. However, the very fact that we do number our years from the approximate date that he is said to have been born cannot be changed by a label. The target audience argument is a double-edged sword. On one hand, children may expect to see dates written using BC/AD notation. On the other hand, however, if BCE/CE is to become the new standard, it makes good sense to &quot;start children off on the right foot&quot;, so to speak. Children in America might expect to buy milk by the gallon, but one of these days we americans are going to move over to the metric system like the rest of the world. It makes sense then to think that we would teach the metric system to children when they are young and impressionable, and therefore set them on the correct path. It is my understanding that academia is moving towards a wholesale adoption of the BCE/CE notation, and as children grow up, they will be expected to adopt this system as well. At the very least, we should have a chapter introducing ''both notations'', explaining why they are what they are, and explaining that they are equivalent, regardless of which one is used throughout the book. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:53, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

:: '''Revised Text''': &lt;nowiki&gt;===What is BC/AD? ===&lt;/nowiki&gt; With some years, you may see a note that says BC or AD. You may wonder what that means.  AD stands for ''Anno Domini'' which means &quot;Year of the Lord&quot; in Latin, and counts the number of years since the birth of Jesus Christ. So, BC stands for Before Christ. People around the world use this as the standard dating system; though Chinese, Muslims, Buddhists and others have their own ways of counting years, many adopt the BC/AD system as a way of keeping a common year all over the Earth. Some teachers and students today use exactly the same dates for years but they substitue the letters CE for AD. CE means ''Common Era'', while BCE means ''Before Common Era''. The dates in BC and AD notation are exactly the same as BCE and CE notation, but BCE and CE are intended to be more friendly to history students who may not be Christian. In both systems, there is no Year 0, like in a number line in math class. Instead, numbers work like this: BCE/BC years 3 - 2 - 1 -- 1 - 2 - 3 - CE/AD.... and so on up to our own time of 2006 on the CE/AD side.   -[[User:Andrew Watt|Andrew Watt]] 02:23, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

The targeted audience standard takes away one key factor - it becomes irrelevant as to what we (as individuals) believe ''should'' (ie ought to) happen. We really shouldn't be in a position where Wikibooks takes a positive stance to prefer one style over another. Whiteknight says &quot;if BCE/CE is to become the new standard&quot;. Is it? It's been proposed in some places for a while, and has made some inroads, particularly for Jewish audiences and certain courses at certain universities, but on a worldwide view, these inroads are tiny. We really should not take a view as to whether the current standard BC/AD should or should not change, and at present there is nothing to suggest we have a new standard as far as the worldwide general public are concerned. If this changes, then maybe our approach will need changing, but we should not pre-empt it.

Another point you raise is about starting children &quot;off on the right foot&quot;. Again, what the right foot is is a matter of opinion. In particular, I would strongly disagree that the right foot is necessarily what happens in certain subject areas in universities. Most children will not go on to study any particular subject at university. I stopped studying history formally at 16, and could have chosen to do so at 14. What history academics do (and my feeling is that in many areas covered by this book BC/AD notation is still the most common used as university level anyway) is irrelevant here. After all, we would not teach physics to 8 year olds by introducing general relativity and quantum mechanics on the grounds that, if they choose to study the subject at university, they ought to learn them, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:56, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

I (jguk) have my own suggested revised text (based on, but not directly replicating, Andrew's):

:'''Revised Text''': &lt;nowiki&gt;===Dates ===&lt;/nowiki&gt; With some years, you may see a note that says BC or AD. You may wonder what that means.  AD stands for ''Anno Domini'' which means &quot;Year of the Lord&quot; in Latin, and counts the number of years since the birth of Jesus Christ, although since this system was set up it has been found that it is a few years out. The year we are now in, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTYEAR}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, is AD {{CURRENTYEAR}}. In the past, ''AD'' always went before the date, but nowadays it can either go before or after the date - so some would write &lt;nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTYEAR}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; AD instead of AD &lt;nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTYEAR}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

:If we go back in time, we then need a name for the year before AD 1. This is 1 BC, and the year before that was 2 BC, and before that 3 BC and so on. BC stands for &quot;Before Christ&quot;. Although ''AD'' and ''BC'' terms come from a Christian background, in their abbreviated form they are not generally thought of as having any religious meaning, except when deliberately placed in a Christian context. People around the world use this as the standard dating system.

:Another point to note is that as we go back in time, often we cannot be precise about dates. In this book we used the most widely accepted dates for any event, but dates before 1000 BC may, in particular, be a number of years out.

I'm currently half-way through a B.A. with a history major. I can quite confidently say that of the countless textbooks I've bought or referenced only two--yes, ''two''--use BCE/CE; the one was a study of religions (including Judaism) so it doesn't even count, and the other was published in America where all this madness began. And of all my professors I can't recall any using these new terms, except when directly referring to a material that uses them.

This is a new term (meaning 95% of the books at your local library will use the old ones), and it doesn't even have acceptance among big-name publishers outside of America (such as Oxford and Cambridge). Also our sister/parent Wikipedia still uses BC/AD (e.g. [[w:30th century BC]]). All this adds up to powerful precedent for keeping the current terminology. Children are going to be seeing the old terms in the older books their library has anyway (it will be a good couple of decades before these all wear out and are replaced); until the term has ''major'' acceptance (if ever) the majority should rule. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:48, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

:Given the fact that things in academia can be so volatile, and the fact that BCE/CE could, conceivably become the new standard, perhaps we should find some kind of way to change over from one to the other easily. Maybe we could create two templates, {{tl|AD}} and {{tl|BC}} That would take a numerical date as an argument, and automatically format the dates as is appropriate. This way, we can simply change the template to match the current scheme of things. That way, we could simply use a template such as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{AD|2006}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; that could format the dates in a common format that all wikibooks can use. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:07, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

: Actually, Wikipedia allows users to choose which terms they want to go with. See [[w:MediaWiki:Common.css]] (under &quot;Choose whether to have AD/BC dates or CE/BCE dates&quot; comment), [[w:Template:ADCE]], [[w:Template:BCEBC]], and [[w:Wikipedia:User preferences for BCE/CE notation]]. Although asking children to change their user CSS might be a bit much, we should at the least institute the system on our other history books. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 16:49, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

::Adding my own $0.02 here, the whole issue of BCE/CE is really showing a strong ''anti-christian'' bias, just as BC/AD shows a ''pro-christian'' bias (in the eyes of some people).  That is why this is so contentious, and why trying to find neutral ground is so difficult.  A more neutral ''solution'' to the problem is to simply state that such and such event happened x number of years ago.  If you are talking approximations like when the K-T event for Dinosaurs happened, this is a reasonable solution.  If you are off by 100 years because the book is 100 years old, it doesn't really matter much.  Obviously this doesn't work for historical dates like fourscore and seven years ago (right now that would be 1919, or the end of WWI, not the Revolutionary War that was referenced in this famous speech when the date was originally invoked).  I lean personally to the BC/AD notation, but I don't hold that as a strict immutable philosophy.  Either way seems reasonable, and certainly is not justification for an edit war to keep changing it one way or another.  I would strongly suggest that even mixed usage should be tolerated for now until we are reasonably confident that this whole project is up to the quality that we are ready for printing.  Concentrate on the content and don't get bogged down in the minuta.  Certainly don't get steamed over this issue and stop contributing.  We need help here, not edit lawyers.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:17, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

I think, since we are having this discussion now, it would be useful to conclude on it - rather than to put it an abeyance to restart it later. I think that it's good to note that, whilst some have noted just a personal preference, those who are making positive suggestions about which style to use are considering what is best for the target audience of this book. That's an important point, which I may well try to codify into more explicit guidance. As far as the discussion here goes, it is clear that the overwhelming majority see one particular style as being appropriate for this particular wikibook - and most of the discussions translate directly to the question of which date style should be used for other books with a general audience (the alternative may well be appropriate for books with a more targeted audience). I am mindful, however, that at least two of our regular contributors to history books tend to use the other style. I will therefore leave notes on their talkpages inviting them to comment - both on whether there are other points they think we should be considering but haven't, and on whether they would have a problem with changing this one aspect of their writing style. We should then be in a position to reach a conclusion everyone finds acceptable, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 09:41, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

: I think it makes sense to wrap up the discussion, too, and come to some sort of conclusion.  I like the idea of templates &lt;nowiki&gt;{{BC}} and {{AD}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but I think that some serious arguments have been mustered in favor of BC/AD as opposed to BCE/CE.  I think it makes sense 1) to include an explanation of what the terms BC/AD means, and 2) to link them to BCE/CE in the event that said system becomes popular — but that the book itself should reference BC/AD dates whenever possible in the main text.  I intend to go through the Minoan section I wrote this week, and make changes accordingly. -[[User:Andrew Watt|Andrew Watt]] 02:04, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

In the light of the above, I have now gone through the book making the other changes necessary to ensure consistency on BC notation. I have also taken the opportunity to replace the occasional &quot;B.C.&quot; or &quot;A.D.&quot; with &quot;BC&quot; and &quot;AD&quot;. The introductory section on dating referred to above has yet to be written, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:21, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

I'm not going to read through all this, but I will drop in my own ideas. BCE/CE notation is an attempt at not only neutrality, but clarity, and accuracy. On the other hand, BC/AD is simply an historic, Latin/Christian usage. BCE/CE notation is becoming more and more popular, especially in academic texts, and it is indeed strange in a place like WikiBooks, that notation such as BC/AD would be mandated over it. [[User:Canaen|Canaen]] 07:16, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

:Wikijunior is for kids. IMO, as long as they are using BC/AD in U.S., British and Australian public schools for ages 8-12, that's what we should use here. The rest of Wikibooks should do whatever it feels is appropriate for that audience. --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 16:49, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

== Pueblos == 

There are three terms commonly used for this civilization: Ancient Pueblo Peoples, Ancestral Puebloans, and Anasazi. Pueblos are the buildings they built.

== Lots of additions... and what about pre-history? ==

Today I've made significant additions to Carthaginians, Chinese, Minoans and Phoenicians, as well as tidying up other articles. I'm not as expert as such, though I am studying Ancient Civilizations like these at university level. This allows me to write children's style articles with great ease.

Also, I was just thinking about writing some stuff for pre-history, when I realised - you would have to split each region down into its principal prehistoric peoples and give explanations of their origins etc. Confined to just one article, it would be a very long page. I'm going to make a start anyway, it can be sorted later if need be.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To understand why Civil War erupted in England following decades of strong and powerful rule by the monarchy and why the &quot;Supreme Head&quot; of the land, the king himself was executed, we need to delve in to some background history first.

==Rise of the Middle Classes==

During the end of the Middle Ages and particularly in the reign of Henry VII from 1485 to 1509, the English middle class rapidly expanded, and so did their importance and influence in society. Around this time, overseas trade and contact began to develop and flourish through increased contact with Asia and Africa, and in particular, the discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus in 1492, and some people in England started a living from exploiting this &quot;Golden Opportunity&quot; and and becoming merchants and tradesmen. As their wealth increased, and they emerged out of poverty, they began to gain status and standing in society.

At the same time, the social system of feudalism in place since the Norman invasion of England and the power of the the nobles and aristocracy began to decline, as a result of Henry's legislation against them, and one distinct social class began to emerge out of this period called the gentry who mainly included landowners and wealthy merchants.

The new rising middle class and gentry demanded more say in the politics and affairs of the country and a large number of them were elected as members of Parliament in the House of Commons. However, during this time, Parliament still remained a temporary advisory committee that could be called and dismissed at any time by the monarch - but two centuries more of history were about to change all that. Despite the power that they wielded, the Kings and Queens of the Tudor period began to increasingly rely on Parliament as times and circumstances changed. It was not long before they realized that to govern the Kingdom, they would need the support of Parliament, the &quot;Representatives of the People&quot; as it was known.

Direct confrontation and the beginning of hostility between King and Parliament only began during the reign of James I (1603 - 1625). Before this, the previous monarchs of the Tudor dynasty, particularly Elizabeth I managed to get along well with Parliament and of the relatively small number of disputes they had with each other , they managed to resolve them at the end through negotiation and discussion, although it was always Elizabeth who had the final say. 

Parliament, and the middle classes and gentry had gained so much rapid influence under the Tudors, that they argued that they were a formal governing body which would rule in conjunction with monarch, rather than than just simply a temporary advisory committee that could be called and dissolved at any time by will, and the idea quickly established itself under the new ruling Stuart dynasty. This could probably explain why every time James or Charles dissolved Parliament , there was much condemnation and deterioration of relations towards the King.

==Division brewing under James I==
Under the new Stuart dynasty by James I who united England and Scotland under one monarch, a visible rift first began to develop between King and Parliament over the issues such as religion where James wanted to tolerate Catholics and allow them to worship freely in their own church, taxes (although this was mainly inherited from the last years of Elizabeth's reign when MPs complained about heavy taxes to fund wars against France, Spain and Ireland) and the increasingly important issue of how much Parliament should be allowed to be involved in the running of the country and to what extent they were allowed to do this before it became a direct threat  to his position as the sovereign King of England. 

Matters were only made worse when James stated and continuously reinforced his strong belief in the &quot;Divine Right of Kings&quot; which held that monarchs were chosen by God to rule the kingdom, and could rule in any way they wished and that anyone who disagreed with him had disagreement with God. During his reign, he dissolved Parliament in a number of occasions as a result of the disputes he had with it.

Hyperbolas can be thought of as the &quot;opposite&quot; of ellipses - instead of the sum of distances from two foci, the difference is used. This leads to two curves that point in opposite directions. The major axis is 2a units long, and the transverse axis is 2b units long. When a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, eccentricity is again c/a. The foci are at either side of the major axis, c units away from the center.

An &quot;east-west&quot; hyperbola is written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\left( x-h \right)^2}{a^2} - \frac{\left( y-k \right)^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
while a &quot;north-south&quot; one is written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\left( y-k \right)^2}{a^2} - \frac{\left( x-h \right)^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

For rectangular hyperbolas with the coordinate axes parallel to their asymptotes:

As the curve progresses, it gets closer and closer to two lines called '''asymptotes'''. In the second image, the asymptotes are y = ±x. The length of each latus rectum is (..?)</text>

[[Image:Parabola with focus and directrix.svg|right|300px]]

== Geometric Definition ==

A parabola is the set of points that is the same distance away from a single point called the '''focus''' and a line called the '''directrix'''. The distance to the line is taken as the perpendicular distance.

One important point on the parabola itself is called the '''vertex''', which is the point which has the smallest distance between both the focus and the directrix. Parabolas are symmetric, and their lines of symmetry pass through the vertex. Also due to this symmetry, only the vertex and one other point are necessary to completely define a parabola.

== Algebraic definition ==

To derive an equation for a parabola, let's suppose (for now) that the directrix is horizontal and therefore has the equation:
:&lt;math&gt; y = a &lt;/math&gt; where a is some constant.

Also suppose that the focus is given by (x,y) = (b,c). The vertex is then, by definition and inspection, located at:
:&lt;math&gt; (h,k) = \left( b, \frac{|a+c|}{2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Now let's examine the distance between some point in the x-y plane (x*,y*) and focus and directrix. The distance between the point and the focus is given by the distance formula:
:&lt;math&gt; D_1 = \sqrt{(x^*-b)^2 + (y^*-c)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Since the directrix is horizontal, the distance between the point and the line is simply &lt;math&gt; D_2 = |{y^*-a}| &lt;/math&gt;

By the definition of a parabola, both of these distances must be equal, and therefore:

&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{(x^*-b)^2 + (y^*-c)^2} = |y^*-a| &lt;/math&gt;

This is the equation of a parabola, but let's make it a little nicer to work with. First square both sides, and notice the absolute values are no longer needed since the square of a number is always positive:
:&lt;math&gt; (x^*-b)^2 + (y^*-c)^2 = (y^* - a)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

FOILing and then simplifying:
:&lt;math&gt; (x^*-b)^2 + y^{*2} - 2y^*c+c^2 = y^{*2} - 2y^*a + a^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; (x^*-b)^2 - 2y^*c + c^2 = -2y^*a + a^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; (x^*-b)^2  + 2y^*(a-c) + c^2 - a^2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. By differences of two squares we arrive at:
:&lt;math&gt; (x^*-b)^2  + 2y^*(a-c) + (c-a)(c+a)= 0 &lt;/math&gt;. Factoring:
:&lt;math&gt; (x^*-b)^2 + (c-a)((c+a) - 2y^*) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Now notice that the quantity &lt;math&gt; a+c &lt;/math&gt; is twice the y-coordinate of the vertex, and that b is the x-coordinate of the vertex. Therefore:
:&lt;math&gt; (x^*-h)^2 + (c-a)(2k - 2y^*) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Factoring a 2 out of the second term,
:&lt;math&gt; (x^*-h)^2 + 2(c-a)(k - y^*) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; or, letting D be the distance between the distance between the vertex and the focus (which is &lt;math&gt; \frac{c-a}{2} &lt;/math&gt;) we arrive at the most useful form of a parabolic equation:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; (x^*-h)^2 = 4D(y^*-k) &lt;/math&gt; where D is the distance from the vertex to the focus, and (h,k) is the vertex}} 

When written in this form, the [[w:latus rectum|latus rectum]] has a length of 4D. In addition, the coordinates of the vertex itself are (x,y)=(h,k). Using this information, and the symmetry of the parabola, it is straightforward to graph it.

&lt;big&gt;'''But, the formula that is written in the Algebra Textbook is usually &lt;math&gt; x^2 = 4py &lt;/math&gt; if the parabola is vertical and &lt;math&gt; y^2 = 4px &lt;/math&gt; if the parabola is horizontal. And, the focus is (0,p) and the directrix is -p if the parabola is vertical as the focus is (p,0) and the directrix is -p if the parabola is horizontal.====='''
&lt;/big&gt;=====

== Alternate forms ==

The ''standard form'' of a parabola is:
:&lt;math&gt; y = Ax^2 + Bx + C &lt;/math&gt;

where A, B, and C are constants. From this form we can deduce that the '''y-intercept''' of the parabola is ''C''. It can be shown (and will be shown in a later section) that the x-coordinate of the vertex is &lt;math&gt; \frac{-B}{2A} &lt;/math&gt;.</text>

===The Accountability Movement===
Over the last several decades public pressure for educational improvements has grown. After newspapers featured articles of high school graduates who were unable to fill out job applications, the public outcry reached critical mass. Employers wanted assurance that a high school graduate would be literate and capable of performing the duties required in the workplace. The citizenry demanded some accountability when it came to the quality of education students were receiving in public schools. As legislators often do when there is public uproar, they drafted legislation. Suddenly, the federal government became very involved in state and local education. Along with the legislation came money and with the money came accountability measures. And so people, not necessarily trained in the field of education, began to mandate what would and should be done in classrooms. They also decided how &quot;success&quot; would be measured (enter high-stakes testing). As Popham concludes, we have entered into a game of high-stakes testing that we cannot win&quot; (Popham, 12). 

The most prominent of the legislative measures was the passage of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) in 2001. It was the culmination of &quot;standards-based reform directed at low-achieving students... and historically low performing schools&quot; (Jennings &amp; Rentner, 2006). A major problem with the current legislation is that it was drafted by people who are not education professionals. It seems to reason that if you want to bring about change in schools you need to hear from the people who are in the classrooms daily and understand the real issues that need to be addressed. Cuban believes that &quot;teachers are gatekeepers to learning in schools and crucial to the growth of nearly 50 million young children and youth&quot;. A significant problem in the United States is the high proportion of underqualified and ineffective teachers teaching in schools that have high proportions of minority students and students from low socioeconomic areas (Haycock &amp; Peske, 2006).  Due to this teacher distribution, the students in the schools that need the most effective teachers do not have them.  No Child Left Behind is subsequently trying to &quot;fix&quot; this problem by ensuring that all students meet a given set of standards.  Unfortunately, unless high quality teachers are placed in the low performing schools, this is not likely to happen.  Cuban further argues that &quot;student learning still depends on what teachers do in the classrooms&quot; (Cuban, 2007). A major obstacle to teachers is the fact that teachers are not adequately supported (due to both lack of pay and lack of classroom support)which causes them to become over stressed in their profession.  Those teachers who are teaching the at-risk students have far greater challenges than just getting the students to the point that they are ready to learn. 
No great change in education is going to happen without the deliberate efforts of the teachers.  It is essential that legislatures work with educators to draft reform measures that are seen as worthwhile and achievable.  In order to do this, there needs to be active involvement with teachers.  This involvement should include some actual classroom visitation time.  To truly understand the obstacles that teachers face on a daily bases one must experience the daily workings of the classroom teacher.  This will also allow those making financial decisions a view of the lack of educational equipment.  This is especially true for the lack of modern computer technology in many of our schools.  How can we keep up with the digital natives learning styles when we are denied the equipment to do so?  

A study released by the Harvard Civil Rights Project (http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu) summarizes the problems with NCLB by saying the &quot;core of NCLB has simple but controversial accountability provisions: all schools and districts must meet all standards by 2014&quot; (Owens &amp; Sunderman, 2007). This system does not differentiate for the non-English students nor the special education students with IEPs or 504 plans. In addition, with so much emphasis on lower performing students, little time is left for teachers to prepare and teach lessons that challenge high ability students. The focus of NCLB is for all students to reach grade level proficiency rather than for all students to reach their academic potential. The punitive nature of the law causes many school districts to shift their focus, and funding, to those students who are not grade level proficient. For students already performing at proficiency, attention is on their intellectual maintenance rather than intellectual growth. Little attention is given to students already exceeding the goals of NCLB. It is ironic that teachers are taught how important it is to differentiate instruction to meet the needs of all learners but then the government expects all learners, regardless of abilities, to take and pass exactly the same test. This is probably one of the biggest areas of contention for classroom teachers who must administer high-stakes tests to their students.

It is not being argued here that no accountability is needed. Instead, it is suggested that perhaps we are holding the wrong people accountable for the wrong education. There is no doubt that teachers must be part of the accountability formula. What about the first and possibly most influential teachers a child will ever have, the parents? How will parents be held accountable? The problem with the current accountability system is that it makes it very easy to enter into a blame game instead of real discourse about the flaws of our educational system. Are teachers failing, are parents failing,are students failing or is it just possible that our outdated system is failing?

It could be argued that our educational system is in a state of crisis and if we choose not to be part of the solution then we continue to be part of the problem. Meanwhile, all of this debate and stagnation occurs at the educational expense of future workers who will enter an international job market of very well prepared, highly competent workers. It's time for us all to be held accountable.

===Parent and Student Accountability===
&quot;In the best schools, where all children achieve regardless of race or class, several strategies are typically in place, including a commitment to engage parents as partners in the educational process...&quot; (Noguera, 2007). The Parent Teacher Association (PTA) has a long history of promoting parental involvement in education.  The PTA (2007) cites many benefits of parental involvement including increased student motivation and self-esteem, better academic performance, decreased absenteeism, better behavior, and increased enrollment in postesecondary education.  The PTA (2007) also says that parental involvement increases teacher effectiveness and job satisfaction.  Despite all the obvious benefits of parental involvement in education, at present (short of criminal neglect or abuse) a parent is only accountable for their child's education to the point of seeing that they arrive at school.  Dorothy Rich (2007) stated that parents should be held accountable for helping their children become successful learners.  She shared the key points that students should come to school adequately fed, rested, and in good medical condition.  Students should come to school ready to learn with appropriate attitudes and behaviors for school.  Also that children should come from a home that encourages and respects learning.  These statements are of course coming from her experience as an educator who realizes these are all situations classroom teachers have virtually no input or control over.

===How the Accountability Movement Impacts Education===
Accountability can be a valuable tool in the education system, however, it must be determined who is being held accountable for student learning.  The current stance on accountability provided by our federal government is that schools and teachers should bear nearly the entire brunt of the responsibility.  The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) has pushed teachers to be &quot;highly qualified&quot;.  This means teachers must hold at least a bachelor degree in their field and meet the full certification requirements of their prospective state.  The NCLB Act gauges schools based on their performance on standardized tests (high stakes testing).  President Bush during his April 24, 2007 visit to Harlem Village Academy Charter School once again is trying to renew the NCLB Act this year nearly as is, with the slight tweaks of more funding and school choice.  (Kelleher, 2007, U.S. White House, 2007) Schools are held accountable through adequate yearly progress (AYP) and state proficiency tests.  Owens &amp; Sunderman (2006) shed light on some of the current NCLB school accountability policies.  Through their research they show that state proficiency tests are often inflating student performance.  They also point out the sanctions placed on at-risk or Title I schools that are flagged as needing improvement.  Even if these schools are making improvement, if it is not enough, they are held accountable with progressively harsher financial penalties.  There is also the constant concern over a single subgroup not continuing to improve causing a school to fail to meet the AYP standards.

When a school does not make AYP for five consecutive years the NCLB Act gives districts five options:

• Reopen the school as a public charter school.

• Replace all or most of school staff, including the
principal.

• Enter into a contract with an entity such
as a private management company with a
demonstrated record of effectiveness to operate
the school.

• Allow the state to take over the school.

• Engage in any other major restructuring of the
school’s governance arrangement (No Child Left
Behind Act, 2002).

Other concerns related to high-stakes testing include: teacher retention rates, student drop-out rates, a watered down curriculum and depriving children of the joy of learning with so much emphasis on drill and kill instruction and assessment. http://caglecartoons.com/viewimage.asp?ID={11C6F967-83C9-4260-8B28-4840F4FE7724}
Additionally, some feel that diverse schools are unfairly penalized because they have more subgroups that each have to make AYP. Many believe that teachers in &quot;at risk&quot; schools are working very hard and students are making progress. Unfortunately, NCLB has the expectation that everyone will reach a specified level at the end of the year regardless of where they started and what their limitations are. 

Ironically, holding schools in poorer areas &quot;accountable&quot; for their students' performance often actually impedes the teachers' ability to help their at-risk students.  In the first place, compliance with NCLB requires teachers to complete massive amounts of paperwork, which consumes time that the teachers might otherwise have spent improving instruction or working with individual students:  &quot;Nothing could be less efficient than this misappropriation of a teacher's energy and hours&quot; (Kozol, 2005).  Moreover, once a school becomes stigmatized as a result of its students' lower test scores, the likelihood increases that the better teachers will look for positions elsewhere, thus leaving the school in worse condition than before.  Under NCLB, when a school fails to meet the required standard, students may also request to be placed elsewhere; thus the higher achieving students are also likely to leave the school.  Deprived of its better students and teachers and with its funding and very existence threatened, an at-risk school has almost no chance of raising its students test scores to the required level.  Finally, if a school is closed down as a result of failing to meet NCLB requirements, as recently happened to a school in Portsmouth, VA (Fernandez, 2006), nearby schools, which may already be overcrowded, could well be harmed by the influx of at-risk students whom these schools have insufficient resources to accommodate.  Thus holding these schools &quot;accountable&quot; can ultimately penalize teachers, students, and communities alike.

===Repair or Reform?===
sidebar:an interesting video about different school settings http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkOF3K2rCp0

Educators and legislators struggle with how to best bring about the necessary changes in education. Several promising reform models have been proposed. In order to help our children obtain the kind of education needed for a flattening world (Friedman, 2006), our country is going to have to make education a top priority and to do such requires a greater financial investment (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC1y9XZbQS8). Moreover, if accountability reforms are to be meaningful, the teachers and administrators who are currently being &quot;held accountable&quot; for the schools' shortcomings must have some say in how policies are reformed.  Currently, most policy is made at the state and federal levels; however, when these policies prove ineffective, it is not the state and federal officials who are held accountable but teachers and local administrators.  Clearly, the responsible officials should be held accountable for these failed polices—not the teachers and administrators who have been excluded from the decision-making process. An in-depth discussion of reform efforts may be found at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Change_Issues_in_Curriculum_and_Instruction/Reform_Proposal

===Essay Questions===
Should parents be held accountable for their children's learning?  If so, how?  If not, why not?

Response:  Of course parents should be held accountable for their children's learning.  If not are the public school merely there as a babysitting service?  Is that the big picture that the federal government should view our educational system as an educational daycare provider?  Teachers are feeling the brunt of the current accountability system.  Basically schools need to score well enough on the tests to appear adequate.  Teachers are literally being told by their administration to &quot;teach to the test&quot;.  The administrators are doing this not out of any desire to rob students of a well rounded or challenging curriculum but out of necessity.  This is a necessity for their jobs and even to keep the school open.  Basically if the school doesn't perform well enough on the tests their toast.  I've been at the presentation to parents on school vouchers when it looked like the school wasn't going to be able to beef up those test scores.  As an educator it was a sickening prospect to think our students would be bused off to other schools because our school wasn't accredited.  It questioned not only the school at large but my own competency and that of my colleagues as educators.  Why were we to blame?  We were all highly qualified.  Some of us even had master’s degrees in our fields.  Majority of our team were seasoned veterans having several decades under their belt.  We hadn't given up on our students why was our district giving up on us?  To bring this back on course the reason I shed this light was to show where the accountability currently lies.  The teachers/administrators are the only ones really accountable for our nation's children's education.  Why is that?  How can a parent not even send their child to school with a meal, or proper clothes, or even allow for proper rest?  I'm not even talking about homework or help with projects, I'm talking about basic human needs.  I know there are situations where the poverty can be extreme but I'd bet a week's pay 90% of those households have more video games in their house than books.  Parents are allowed to put their kids in a corner, plug them in, and call it a day.  Today's teacher often has to serve not only as the educational facilitator but as student deprogrammer as well.  I would be a gross figure to tally up the hours I waste a day trying to untrain bad habits.  Sadly the old saying &quot;The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.&quot; rings true far far too often.  Can students change for the better, yes.  Can parents change for the better, yes.  Will they do it on their own, no.  Parents must be held accountable for their children's education.  Whether it be mandatory parenting classes, school service, or shoot maybe the government could offer tax breaks for parents identified ('''by teachers''') as active in the child's learning?  I don't have the answers but unfortunately the NCLB Act doesn't either.  Our government needs to hold parents (and students) accountable in addition to just teachers, administrators, and schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Keyboard ==

It's great to have some help with the book! I was wondering where everyone went! Thanks, Hoogli.

Your textual addition, &quot;On a keyboard, the white keys represent A through G, and back to A again. However, there are also black keys, which play intermediate notes that are known as sharp or flat notes. Oddly, the interval between two white notes is the same as between a black and white note.&quot;
:It might be construed that the intervals B-C and E-F are odd contradictions to the otherwise simple layout of the instrument. Would it be helpful to those who don't have any knowledge of this if we indicate that between any two successive keys is a half step NO MATTER WHAT and that the progression of keys goes (from C) white-black-w-b-w-w-b-w-b-w-b-w-w? This would, to me, seem more consistent a description than &quot;the notes go c-d-e-f-g-a-b-c and the black notes indicate sharps and flats, which are half step modifications to the natural pitches, and then the distance between b and c, and e and f is different than the normal distance between white notes.&quot; Let me know what you think! --[[User:Aaronjgardner|A.J.]] 17:59, 2 June 2007 (UTC)

What is the spoiler warning for? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:84.231.72.129|84.231.72.129]] ([[User talk:84.231.72.129|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/84.231.72.129|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
:It's because it's the answer to the above exercise. Oh, and you should [[w:WP:SIG|sign your comments]] with &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;. --[[User:Cuckooman4|cuckooman4]] (&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Cuckooman4|t]]&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Cuckooman4|c]]&lt;/sub&gt;) 00:50, 24 December 2007 (UTC)

== Accidentals ==

Quote: &quot;Following this reasoning to its logical conclusion, you will see that a G-sharp could also be called an A-flat. By which name should you rightfully call that key--G-sharp or A-flat? The answer is, either of them. In fact, all black keys have two note names assigned to them--they are the sharp of the key that precedes it and the flat of the key that follows it. This concept in music theory is called enharmonics. Enharmonic notes are simply two notes which are spelled differently but which have the exact same pitch.

Another way to think of it is to treat enharmonic notes like the American spellings of words versus their British counterparts--for example, American color versus the British colour. While the spelling differs, either spelling is accepted as &quot;correct&quot; and both words mean the exact same thing.&quot;

This is not true, as the different spellings of notes are used in different harmonic contexts. A chord that goes Bb-D-F-G# is harmonically very different to one that goes Bb-D-F-Ab, even though they sound the same in isolation (given an equal-tempered tuning system, I should add). Should we not make it clear at this point that this is the case? Or should we leave it for the harmony chapter? [[User:Henre|Henre]] ([[User talk:Henre|talk]]) 15:12, 4 December 2008 (UTC)

== Basic music theory needed ==

It is great to see another point of view describing technical information about modes, chord development, progressions and the like in very strait forward language.
If there was a bit more description about understanding key signatures and time signatures I would refer students to this book.
I hope it is not too mind numbingly basic information. [[User:Violinsensei|Violinsensei]] ([[User talk:Violinsensei|talk]]) 01:25, 13 July 2010 (UTC)
:If you know the information, or can look it up (and provide references) you can add the material yourself.

== Dialogue ==
{{Listen |filename=Irish lesson 1 dialogue.ogg |title=&quot;Dialogue Lesson 1&quot; |description=This passage spoken in an '''Ulster Irish dialect'''|right}}
: '''''Seán''': Dia dhuit! Is mise Seán. Cad is ainm duit?''
: '''''Siobhán''': Dia's Muire dhuit. Is mise Siobhán. Conas a litrítear Seán?
: '''''Seán''': Litrítear S-e-a-fada-n. Conas atá tú?
: '''''Siobhán''': Go maith, agus tusa?
: '''''Seán''': Iontach, go raibh maith agat.
: '''''Siobhán''': Go maith! Slán leat, a Sheáin
: '''''Seán''': Go dtí amárach.

== Hello! ==
{| {{User:Dalta/Table|Vocabulary|Hello!|Dia duit!|2}}
! Béarla
! Gaeilge
|-
| Hello
| Dia duit (deea ditch)
|-
| Good morning
| Lá breá duit!/ Maidin mhaith!
|-
| Good night!
| Oíche mhaith!
|-
| See you tomorrow!/ Until tomorrow
| Go dtí amárach!
|-
| Goodbye
| Slán
|}

; Notes
* ''Dia duit'' means literally ''God be with you'', the correct response is ''Dia is Muire Duit'' (God and Mary be with you). The plural is ''Dia daoibh'' and ''Dia is Muire daoibh''.

; Examples
* ''Dia daoibh, a rang.''
*: Good morning, class!
* ''Conas atá sibh inniu?''
*: How are you (plural) today?
* ''Slán go fóill!''
*: Bye, see you soon!

== What's your name? ==
Asking someone's name in Irish is different from English, the direct translation would be something like 'What name is on you?' 'Cad is ainm duit?' The reply would be (Person's name)'' is ainm dom'', e.g. ''Seán is ainm dom''

'Duit' is the compound form of 'do' (to) and 'tú' (you). The full table is below. You'll notice these are the same forms used in the greeting ''Dia dhuit/dhaoibh''.

; Examples
* ''Cad is ainm duit?'' [Cahd is ahn-m ditch]
*: What's your name
* ''Peadar agus Robárd is ainm dóibh.''
*: Their names are Peter and Robert.
* ''Cad is ainm dó''
*: What's his name?
* ''Cad is ainm dóibh?''
*: What's their name?

|-
| Really bad
| Uafásach
|-
| And you?
| Agus tú féin?
|-
| Thank you
| Go raibh maith agat 
|}

; Note
''Go raibh maith agat'' literally translates as ''May good be upon you''.

; Examples
* '''''Robárd''': Dia dhuit, a Róisín. Conas atá tú?''
*: Hello, Roisín. How are you?
* '''''Roisín''': Go hiontach, go raibh maith agat. Agus tusa, a Robáird?''
*: Very well, thanks. And you, Robert?
* '''''Robárd''': Go maith freisin. Slán leat!''
*: I'm good too. See you later!

;Notes
*When talking to someone directly, an 'a' is put before the name and the name is changed to the vocative case. This will be dealt with in a later lesson.
*When two vowels come together, a 'h' is usually put before the second vowel. In this example, a 'h' was put between 'go' and 'iontach'

* '''''Robárd''': Litrítear é mar seo, R (mar Rothar); O (mar Oráiste); B (mar Baile Átha Cliath); A fada (mar Árainn); R (mar Rothar); D (mar Duine).''
*: It's spelt R (as in Rothar(Bike)); O (as in Oráiste(Orange)); B (as in Baile Átha Cliath(Dublin)); A fada (as in Árainn(Aran, islands off the west coast of Ireland)); R (as in Rothar); D (as in Duine(person)).
* '''''Brian''': go raibh míle maith agat. Slán, a Robáird!
*: Thanks alot. Goodbye, Robert.

;Irish only has one accent mark, resembling the French acute accent, called the ''síneadh fada'' (long mark) or simply ''fada''.

== Summary ==
In this lesson, you have learned
* How to greet people (''Dia dhuit; Conas atá tú; Slán'').
* How to introduce yourself (''Roisín is ainm dom'').
* How to introduce others (''Robárd is ainm dó'').
* How to say how you are (''Go hiontach; go dona; go maith'').
* How to spell your name (''Litrítear P-E-T-E-R'').
* How to ask others about any of the above (''Cad is ainm duit?; An bhfuil tú go maith; Conas a litrítear é?'').

{{IrishLessons}}

Irish now has one diacritic, the sineadh fada. There was a second in use in Old Irish - the sí buailte or ponc séimhithe, which is a dot on top of consonants. For example, this diacritic, when represented as a dot on top of the letter b converts the b sound to a v sound. The sí buailte was replaced in Modern Irish with the use of a h immediately after the affected character, thusly the b with the dot on top is now written as bh, etc. The buailte was pronounced bool-che.

var result = &quot;&quot;
if(marks &gt;= 50)
  result = &quot;passed&quot;
else
  result = &quot;failed&quot;
println(&quot;Your results just came in, you &quot; + result + &quot;.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

At first sight it does not seem so bad. But we can do better if the branching itself evaluates a value.

&lt;source lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;
println(&quot;Your results just came in, you &quot; +
  (if(marks &gt;= 50) &quot;passed&quot; else &quot;failed&quot;) + &quot;.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

In fact, Java/C# provides you with the &lt;tt&gt;(...) ? (...) : (...)&lt;/tt&gt; syntax just because it's very handy at times.

Often this construct saves the Scala programmer from inventing a silly name for a short-lived variable. Perhaps it's equally important that it does not assign a silly value to it to start with.

Of course, if the value is needed more than once you probably should introduce a value. Even then,

&lt;source lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;
val result: String = if(marks &gt;= 50) &quot;passed&quot; else &quot;failed&quot;
println(&quot;Your results just came in, you &quot; + result + &quot;.&quot;)
println(&quot;Your academic record now shows that you have &quot; + result + &quot; the course.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

This does not prevent you from using &lt;tt&gt;if ... else ...&lt;/tt&gt; as statements. Statements, after all, are expressions.

== Scaling It Up ==
Understandably &lt;tt&gt;if ... else if ... else ...&lt;/tt&gt; chains are just as common, and they work just as fine in Scala. We might, for a finer result, try,

&lt;source lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;
val result: String = 
  if(marks &gt;= 85) 
    &quot;A&quot;
  else if(marks &gt;= 70) 
    &quot;B&quot;
  else if(marks &gt;= 60) 
    &quot;C&quot;
  else if(marks &gt;= 50) 
    &quot;D&quot;
  else
    &quot;F&quot;
println(&quot;You've got &quot; + result + &quot;.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

But more than often we need to branch on values rather than conditions. Basically that's why we have &lt;tt&gt;switch&lt;/tt&gt; in Java/C#. Scala uses &lt;tt&gt;match&lt;/tt&gt; for this,

&lt;source lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;
val result: String = 
  if(marks &gt;= 85) 
    &quot;A&quot;
  else if(marks &gt;= 70) 
    &quot;B&quot;
  else if(marks &gt;= 60) 
    &quot;C&quot;
  else if(marks &gt;= 50) 
    &quot;D&quot;
  else
    &quot;F&quot;
println(&quot;You've got &quot; + result + &quot;.&quot;)

result match {
  case &quot;A&quot; | &quot;B&quot; =&gt; println(&quot;Congratulations!&quot;)
  case &quot;C&quot; =&gt; println(&quot;There is room for improvement, though.&quot;)
  case _ =&gt; println(&quot;We are concerned about your progress.&quot;)
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Several things look different. For one, these cases do not use &lt;tt&gt;break&lt;/tt&gt; to indicate the end of a branch. You don't have a fall through. Not that you need to fall through. They make programs harder to read and reason about. You can, however, group equivalent cases so that the principal use of falling through &lt;tt&gt;switch&lt;/tt&gt; statements can be handled. Although Scala does not have the &lt;tt&gt;default&lt;/tt&gt; keyword, the underscore reads &quot;anything else&quot;, so to speak.

If you, for some reason, try this in Java 1.6 or lower, you'll probably notice another difference. &lt;tt&gt;switch&lt;/tt&gt; only handles primitive types (and &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt; since Java 1.7) so a straightforward translation will have to use &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; chains with a couple of &lt;tt&gt;equals&lt;tt&gt; calls. Scala ''uses'' &lt;tt&gt;equals&lt;/tt&gt; to match cases for objects to make the code cleaner to read.

We will have to say more on &lt;tt&gt;match&lt;/tt&gt; here and there in this book. For now, you probably will appreciate the ability to mix conditionals and cases to handle very special cases, like,

&lt;source lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;
case &quot;D&quot; if marks &lt; 52 =&gt; println(&quot;Close call!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Although to make sense, this case should sit above the default case.

== Trying And Failing ==
Even a &lt;tt&gt;try ... catch ...&lt;/tt&gt; block is an expression in Scala and this can result in remarkably readable code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;scala&quot;&gt;
val n: Int = try {
  userInput.toInt
} catch {
  case _ =&gt; 0
}
&lt;/source&gt;

As an aside, note that &lt;tt&gt;catch&lt;/tt&gt; looks very much like &lt;tt&gt;match&lt;/tt&gt; (and the underscore here means we don't care which specific exception was thrown).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Game Boy Advance Development|Development of a sample drawing application}}

=== GBA development with the HAM IDE and compiler ===

==== Step 1 - Setup: ====
The first thing that needs to be done for this project is to download and install the necessary programs. Download the following files from these links

*[http://jharbour.com/forum/index.php?topic=963.0 Software Development Kit]
*[http://www.console-dev.de/page_visualham/#downloads Graphical User Interface Update]

Open up the first executable and run it, when it is done extracting the files it will ask you to type in 'OK' (so do that), and also put in an installation path. Make the installation path C:\GBADev . When these steps are done, click on 'Install', and it should finish just fine.

Next run the second executable, click on 'Next', then select 'I accept the agreement', click next again, select the folder that vham will be installed to (it should already be selected, but if not, put it under C:\GBADev\vham ), then click 'Next' -&gt; 'Next' -&gt; 'Next'-&gt; 'Install' -&gt; Finish'. If all went well you should have your Gameboy Advance development environment all set up and ready to make some games!

==== Step 2 - Getting started with a new project: ====
If you haven't already opened up the VHam environment, go ahead and double-click on the 'VisualHAM' icon on your desktop. Once its open we are going to create a new project, so go ahead and click on 'File' &gt;&gt; 'New' &gt;&gt; 'New Project'. The project type that we are going to make is a '[C++ Empty]' type project, so select that, and then type in a project name and location. It doesn't matter what the project name is, as long as you remember it, and the location can be any folder on the hard drive. (If you can't think of a good project name, or location just input &quot;etchasketch&quot; as the project name and &quot;c:\projects\etchasketch&quot; as the Location).

==== Step 3 - Getting aquainted with the main.cpp file: ====
Once the project has been created you will have in the left hand window 2 files that you can edit, main.cpp and makefile. Do not make any changes to the makefile (it will not be needed in this project), it is only needed for more advanced projects. The only file that we are going to be changing is the main.cpp file. Basically this file is the code that is executed when the game is being run. Go ahead and double click on 'main.cpp' in that left hand pane.

Mostly this file is pretty empty, except for a few lines. All that your game does right now is just display's the HAM logo, and then shows a blank black screen. Let me explain what some of the items in this file are, and what they do.

 #include &lt;mygba.h&gt;

This line includes into the program a whole bunch of other functions and declaration that we can use. This is needed unless you want to do everything at a machine level (not pretty)

 MULTIBOOT

Allows your game to boot off off a linker cable and not need a cartridge. Not needed for our project, and it can be deleted.

 int main(void)
 {}

Everything within the first and the very last curly brace is the main body of the program. The game starts at the first curly brace, and ends at the last ending brace.

 ham_Init();

First statement in the body of the program. Initializes all of the HAM features. Also causes that little 'Created with HAM&quot; logo to show up at the beginning of your game.

 while(true)
 {}

A loop that continues to run over and over again and never finishes. This basically stalls the game and causes it to never finish (Most of the time a console game will finish by the user turning off the power). If the game gets all the way to the end it will restart back at the begning. This statement just keeps things from ever ending.

 return 0;

This statement just tells your main() function to exit out with a return code of '0'. Generally this means that the program ended successfully. When this line is executed the game ends, and then restarts back up again (if the power is still on).

==== Step 4 - Building and running your game: ====

This step should be fairly easy to do. Once you have made any of your changes to the main.cpp file and you want to see how they affect the game, simply save your code by clicking on 'File' &gt;&gt; 'Save All', and then compile and run your game by pressing the 'F6' key on your keyboard. You can also build with other options by clicking on the red ! If everything worked correctly, you should have a running game! Congratulations... its not much yet, but soon it will be.

==== Step 5 - Adding our first additional function to main.cpp: ====

Now we are going to get into really adding some useful code into this game. We want our game to show something on the screen, right? Lets add a function that will draw a certain colored pixel to the screen. If you have questions about pixels or functions, I will explain this in class.

Right after the line of code that says ham_Init(); you will need to add the following line of code

 ham_SetBgMode(3);

This will set the gameboy hardware into a certain video mode (mode 3) that will give us direct access to the video memory in a sequential memory array (I'll explain that term in class). This makes it easy to put a single pixel on the screen basically.

Now we need to add a function to our program. All functions will be added above the main() function, but below the #include &lt;mygba.h&gt; section. Any function that calls another can only call the functions that are declared above it. main() will be calling all of our other functions, so it needs to be at the bottom. Add the following function to your main.cpp file

 //Function that draws a single pixel to the screen
 void drawPix(int xPos, int yPos, int color)
 {
 unsigned short* videoBuffer = (unsigned short*)0x6000000;
 videoBuffer[(yPos*240) + xPos] = color;
 }


Now that you have that function, anywhere in your main() function you can call drawPix(). You need to give the function how far to the right of the screen (xPos), how far down on the screen (yPos), and what color to make the pixel (color). I'll explain this is better detail in class. But if example you wanted to draw a single white pixel 50 pixels over and 100 pixels down, you would call in your main() the following line of code

 drawPix(50,100,0xFFFFFF);

You can test this, save your project, and then run your program (see step 4 for detail on that).

==== Step 6 - Saving information with variables: ====

With our Etch-A-Sketch program we are going to need to save certain information about where the Etch-A-Stetch pen is, and what color it is currently drawing. This is going to take 5 variables. 2 of them will save where the pen is at (how far over and down it is), and then other 4 for the color (how much Red, Green, and Blue is in the pen, as well as the total pen color).

Right above your function that we just declared, we are going to make 6 global variables. Put the following lines right below your #include &lt;mygba.h&gt; section (but above the other functions).

 // Global variables
 int curX, curY, curColor;
 u8 cR, cG, cB;

We also need to initialize these variables in your main() function so that the values are set to zero, and not to some random garbage value. Right under the statement ham_SetBgMode(3); put the following lines

 curX = 0;
 curY = 0;
 cR = 0xFF;
 cG = 0xFF;
 cB = 0xFF;
 curColor = 0xFFFF;

Now you can keep track of your drawing pen from any function by either checking the value of this variable, or you can change the value to something else. We will be doing this later on when we get input from the joypad. In fact this leads right up to our next section.

==== Step 6 - Getting input from the keyboard ====

What good is a game if you can't control it? Input is actually pretty easy. Its just a matter of checking to see if certain values are true are false. Basically the 'A' button is either being pressed at a given time, or its not. The tricky part is deciding what each of these key buttons being pressed means. Lets make another function right under the drawPix() function that gets input from the joypad, and changes our variables based on that input.

 //Gets input from the joypad
 void query_input()
 {
 
 } 

Notice how there is some blank space in between the curly braces. We are going to add some more code in here that is actually going to check the joypad buttons. This is done by using an If() statement. If the statement is true, then the line of code right below will get run, otherwise it will be skipped. Lets say that we want to move the pen down when the down button is pressed. We would use the following 2 lines of code

 if (F_CTRLINPUT_DOWN_PRESSED)
 curY++;

If the down button is being held down when this code executes, the variable curY will be incremented by 1. variable++ means the same as varible = variable + 1
Lets put the following code into the query_input() function

 if (F_CTRLINPUT_UP_PRESSED)
 curY--;
 if (F_CTRLINPUT_DOWN_PRESSED)
 curY++;
 if (F_CTRLINPUT_LEFT_PRESSED)
 curX--;
 if (F_CTRLINPUT_RIGHT_PRESSED)
 curX++;
 if (F_CTRLINPUT_B_PRESSED)
 curColor = RGB(--cR, cG, cB);
 if (F_CTRLINPUT_A_PRESSED)
 curColor = RGB(cR, --cG, cB);
 if (F_CTRLINPUT_L_PRESSED)
 curColor = RGB(cR, cG, --cB);
 if (F_CTRLINPUT_R_PRESSED)
 {
 cR = 0xFF;
 cG = 0xFF;
 cB = 0xFF;
 curColor = RGB(cR, cG, cB);
 }

This code segment is a little long and ugly, and I will explain more in class about specifics, but all it pretty much does it check the up, down, left, right, B, A, L, and R buttons on the joypad. When those are pressed it sets variables to certain values.

==== Step 7 - Making the Game loop ====

We've got a function to get input from the user, we have a function to put stuff on the screen, not we just have to put it all togeather by making our main game loop. We are making one more function that will be called on every screen refresh, basically once every 60 seconds or so. Every screen refresh we are going to check the input buttons, and then draw to the screen. Right after your drawPix() and query_input(), but before your main() functions you need to make another function that calls both of those other first 2 functions.

 // Function called every screen refresh
 void vbl_func()
 {
 query_input();
 drawPix(curX,curY, curColor);
 }

Pretty simple isn't it? It really is. Most of the work is already being done in the other 2 functions that we made, so there isn't much more work to do in here. The only other thing that we need to do is to call this functions every 1/60th of a second. This can be done by putting in main() after the variable initialization the following code statement

 //Starts running the vbl_func every screen refresh
 ham_StartIntHandler(INT_TYPE_VBL,(void*)&amp;vbl_func);

Now that it is checking the joypad every 1/60th of a second, and drawing your pen to the screen, your Etch-A-Sketch is done! Save the file, build it and run it! There still might be other enhancements that you could add to it (such as stopping the pen from falling off the side of the screen, or adding on screen instructions that explain how to use the game). You have an interactive, and I might add pretty fun, program that runs on a Gameboy Advance system.

Once you've got the basic program running correctly, save it off and back it up, then try making other changes to the program on your own and see if you can make the program a little more unique and personal. Maybe you could make the pen bigger or a different shape than just a single dot, or maybe make the pen spin around in a circle when you press the start button, or any one of a hundred different things.

I tried this recipe , a slight variation of of the one found here (Cycling Forums / Five40) (this is the one I found to be sour, probably due to the wine/vinegar:)&lt;br&gt;
1.5 cups of coffee&lt;br&gt;
1 cup of red wine&lt;br&gt;
0.5 cups of olive oil&lt;br&gt;
0.5 cups of molasses&lt;br&gt;
0.33 cups of Balsamic vinegar&lt;br&gt;
0.33 cups of Worcestershire sauce&lt;br&gt;
2 tablespoons of chili powder&lt;br&gt;
2 tablespoons of onion powder&lt;br&gt;
2 tablespoons of garlic powder&lt;br&gt;
1 tablespoon of Marmite&lt;br&gt;
1 garlic clove, minced&lt;br&gt;
I felt the need to document this (it did turn black, made a tri-tip very soft and juicy, and blackened caramelized like Fred steak).  It marinated for 72 hours. It was close enough to merit honing in on the real recipe. &lt;br&gt;

I fixed up the fractions as they were wrong in the original cycling forums recipe. I will also try and engage the author at cycling forums to hone in on this recipie.
Also, I am refining this recipe. The marinade here was too sour, and I could taste a lot of the sourness in the final product. It did however caramelize properly and blackened like Fred's steak. If you want to stick to the recipe, I would recommend really good not-sour-at-all red wine and very sweet Balsamic vinegar. &lt;br&gt;
I am trying this tonight:&lt;br&gt;

1 ground up garlic clove&lt;br&gt;
1.5 cups of coffee&lt;br&gt;
1.33 cups of Jim Beam bourbon (4 year whiskey)&lt;br&gt;
0.5 cups of Olive Oil&lt;br&gt;
0.5 cups molasses&lt;br&gt;
0.33 cups of Tamari Sauce&lt;br&gt;
0.33 cups of honey&lt;br&gt;
1 tablespoon of Marmite (smells and tastes like Brewers Yeast, its not that bad or strong, so don't believe that its too strong or too nasty to use.)&lt;br&gt;
2 tablespoons of salt (The original recipe here was not salty enough)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I was also considering adding a dash of MSG, but I don't have any. I will report here on how close I get to the real deal with this recipe. The main goal of this marinade is to eliminate sourness. I took out the Worcestershire sauce (I may consider adding it back), the Red Wine and the Vinegar. I might also consider simply adding the honey portion back as Molasses, which seems to be the key ingredient in this marinade.

The above recipe did not have the &quot;Fred Steak Flavor.&quot; It was a good steak, soft, but it was off on the flavor. The first recipe was closer so I have to focus on making that salties and sweeter and less sour. [[User:Mickrussom|Mickrussom]] 00:11, 1 July 2007 (UTC)

Folks...Schaub is, umm, Jewish and probably kosher (since he's a butcher). Half the ingredients you list here couldn't possibly be deemed kosher in 1950's. Only today is everything we touch kosher (including Mountain Dew). Try agin.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Smerdis 522 BC ==

In 522 BC, when Cambyses II was busy with his campaigns in Africa, a prominent Magus named Gaumata who was favored and appointed to a very high position by Cambyses usurped the throne claiming to be Smerdis or Bardiya the son of Cyrus the Great who was believed to have been long dead killed by Cambyses II.

The history of the &quot;false&quot; Smerdis is narrated by Herodotus and Ctesias according to official traditions; Cambyses before his death supposedly confessed to the murder of his brother, and in public explained the whole fraud. But, as Darius said, nobody had the courage to oppose the new king, who ruled for seven months over the whole empire.

Soon after his accession to the throne, Smerdis started to issue proclamations designed to favor the old Magian religion and to supercede Zoroastrianism. First of all, Magism was made the state religion and the capital was transferred from Pasargadae to a castle in the district of Nisaya. Following this proclamation, Zoroastrianism was targetted and numerous Zoroastrian temples were destroyed. But the most infamous act Smerdis is held responsible for is the edict reversing the decree of Cyrus guaranteeing religious freedom to the Jews of Babylon. The construction of Solomon's Temple had to be stopped temporarily. 

In September 522BC, after a reign of seven months, Smerdis was killed by Darius, a distant cousin of Cambyses, who was hailed as a liberator and a true scion of the Achaemenid family and was crowned as Emperor in the year 522 BC

== Darius I 522 - 485 BC ==



Darius was twenty-eight years old when he led the rebellion that overthrew the false Smerdis and restored the Achaemenid dynasty.


=== The Name 'Darius' ===

Darius was originally called Khashayarsha Darayavaus which was Romanized to Xerxes Darius by Roman historians. Darayavaus, itself might have been actually Darayavahu, which has been suffixed with an -s in tune with the practice of writing Old Persian. His name could be roughly translated as &quot;He Who Holds Firm the Good&quot;. Darius is credited with the famous inscription at Behistun in which he declares:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Adam Darayavaus, Kshaayathiya Vazraka, Hakhamanisha Parsa,Arya Aryacita&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

which would roughly translate as 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I am Darius, Great King, Achaemenid Persian, an Aryan with an Aryan lineage&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


=== Rebellion and Disorder 522 - 516 BC ===

Soon after his accssion to the Persian Empire, Darius had to contend with numerous insurrections and counter unrest in the provinces. There was a rebellion in Susiana where a certain Atrines had crowned himself king. The rebellion was crushed with an iron hand the leader put to death. But a new commander appeared in the person of a certain Martes (Martiya) who resumed the insurrection. Darius took the field in person and advanced against the enemy. This alarmed the Susianians so much so that they laid hands on the pretender and slew him.

Simultaneous rebellions emerged in Babylonia where the rebellion was led by Nebuchadnezzar (Nidintu-Bael), a son of Nabonidus and  prince of the Neo-Babylonian dynasty. Darius led a huge army into Mesapotamia and defeated the Mesapotamians on the banks of the Tigris. A second battle was fought outside the Babylonian capital by the Babylonians in their retreat in which the Babylonians were defeated once again. Nebuchadnezzar escaped on  his horse and threw himself upon Babylon. But Babylon was besieged by the Persians who captured it in a matter of days. Nebuchadnezzar was captured and killed.

At this juncture, the Persians were thrown into peril by three simultaneous eruptions in Media, Armenia and Assyria which comprised the most important provinces of the Empire. A Median candidate to the throne rose in the form of one Xathrites (Kshatritha) who claimed descent from the Median king Cyaxares. Armenia and Assyria aided him and he tried to  snatch Media by force. A battle was fought in the three fronts in Media, Armenia and Assyria all of which were indecisive (though Darius claimed victory in his inscriptions). Soon, Hyrcania and Parthia rose in rebellion against Persia and supported Xathrites. Darius took the field in person and marched against Xathrites at the head of a large army. Xathrites gave battle at a place called Kudrus and was defeated. He captured Ecbatana forcing Xathrites to become a fugitive anbd flee to the East.  However, the unfortunate Xathrites was overtaken and brought before the king. Xathrites was made prisoner and horribly mutilated as a punishment before being put to death.

Darius now resolved to take revenge and invaded Parthia and Hyrcania annexing all the cities and towns on the route.But he was forced to return early in order to tackle a rebellion in Sagartia. A new pretender (Chitrantakhma) rose in the province of Sagartia who declared himself king. Darius moved against the new pretender and captured him with ease. He was subjected to the same kind of punishment as Xathrites.

At the same time, a second pretender (Vahyazdatha) claiming himself to be the actual Smerdis rose in North East Persia. However, a majority of the Persians and Medes were highly pleased with the efficient  rule and administration of Darius that they refused to desert him. The impostor was defeated in two successive battles by Darius' general Artabardes (Arthavardiya) and crucified.A second rebellion arose in Babylonia which was once again quelled with an iron hand.  
      
Around this time, Oroetes the Governor of Sardis, had a quarrel with Mitrobates the Governor of a neighbouring province and murdered him. Darius sent him a message severely reprimanding him for his conduct. Angered, Oroetes murdered the messenger. Furious at this challenge to authority, Darius raced to Sardis and ordered his men to arrest the Governor and kill him.

Quite similar was the case with the Governor of Egypt who minted pure gold and silver coins in his own name without the knowledge of the Emperor. But when Darius came to know of it he was captured and killed.

It was six years before rebellions and insurrections could be quelled and peace established all over the Empire. However, once having established peace and stamped his authority over the provinces, Darius proceeded to rule in moderation and justice and renew the policy of Achaemenid expansion followed by Cyrus II and Cambyses II.

=== The Behistun Inscription 515 BC ===

In 515BC, soon after establishing his hold over Persia, Darius inscribed the details of his accession in face of the usurper Smerdis and details about his legitimate claim to the Persian throne on the rock-face of a mountain near the town of Bagasthana or &quot;God's place&quot; (Romanized to Behistun) in the Kermanshah province of Iran. The inscription is approximately 15 metres high by 25 metres wide, and 100 metres up a limestone cliff from an ancient road connecting the capitals of Babylonia and Media (Babylon and Ecbatana). The inscription includes three versions of the same text, written in three different cuneiform script languages: Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian and was used by Henry Rawlinson to decipher the First Persian cuneiform texts in 1838.


=== Conquest of the Punjab 515 BC ===

Darius was as ambitious as his predecessors Cyrus II and Cambyses II had been. Having earlier sent a mission to survey the Indus from Attock to its mouth on the Arabian Sea coast, he sent an expedition under Scylax to reduce the whole Indus plain. This brought Punjab,Sindh and Gandhara under Persian suzerainty. The two Indian  satraps were the richest provinces of the Empire and yielded the highest tribute.

=== Expedition to Thrace and Scythia 513 -512 BC ===

Darius launched an invasion of Greece in 513 BC with the probable intent of expanding the Achaemenid kingdom into Europe and with the ambition of  conquering the whole world. However, Herodotus says that the expedition was initiated with the purpose of capturing a Persian rebel and fugitive Democedes who had sought refuge in Greece. Nevertheless, Darius did desire to subjugate Thrace and the Greek city-states and with this aim in mind he crossed the Bosporus into Europe.

So, in 513 BC, Darius set out along with the Persian fleet comprising 600 ships and an army of 700,000 to 800,000 men, as per George Rawlinson's estimate, across the Bosporus to conquer Thrace and the countries that lay beyond. Marching along Thrace's northern shore, Darius entered the Balkan and defeated the Getae. Crossing the Danube, the Persians proceeded northwards and subjugated Scythia. Returning to Thrace with his army intact, Darius posted a body of 80,000 in Europe under the command of a certain Megabazes to subjugate Thrace before returning to Persia.

Megabazus appears to have been fully worthy of the trust reposed in him. In a single campaign (B.C. 506) he overran and subjugated the entire tract between the Propontis and the Strymon, thus pushing forward the Persian dominion to the borders of Macedonia. Among the tribes which he conquered were the Perinthians, Greeks; the Pseti, Cicones, Bistones, Sapaei, Dersaei and Edoni, Thracians; and the Paeoplae and Siripasones, Pseonians. These last, to gratify a whim of Darius, were transported into Asia. The Thracians who submitted were especially those of the coast, no attempt, apparently, being made to penetrate the mountain fastnesses and bring under subjection the tribes of the interior.An embassy was sent to Macedonia whose king, an ancestor of Alexander the Great at once accepted Persian suzerainty.

=== The Ionian Revolt 499 - 494 BC ===

In 502BC, the usland of Naxos in the Aegean Sea rose into revolt against the Persians and appealed to Aristagoras the overlord of the Greek city of Miletus for help. Aristagoras, in turn, sought out the aid of Artaphernes, the satrap of Lydia and brother to Darius I of Persia. Artaphernes agreed to supply Aristagoras with a fleet of ships under the command of the esteemed Persian admiral Megabates.In return, Aristagoras promised to cede the islands and Cyclades to Artaphernes.This was possible only if the conspirators won. However, the conspiracy was discovered before it could be executed and the fleet was forced to retreat.  

Due to the failure of the plan, Aristogoras was unable to repay Artaphernes who insisted that the former fulfill his promise.Aristagoras chose to incite the Ionian Greeks, to revolt against their Persian masters.

In 499BC, Miletus rose in rebellion. Aristogoras relinguished his post as a Persian Governor and sent soldiers to arrest the Governors of Mylasa,Termera and Mytilene. But Aristogoras realized that the Persian soldiers might arrive sooner or later and hence appealed to Greece for help.Sparta did not respond favorably. But Athens provided a fleet of twenty ships and  Eretria,five. 

The combined European and Ionian Greek contingents attacked the Lydian capital, Sardis and plundered the city. However, they were forced to bid a speedy retreat by an accidental  fire that broke out in the city. Aristagoras retreated, but the Persian troops stationed At Ephesus caught up with them and defeated them severely. 

The fact that such a small Greek contingent could overthrow a Persian garrison and capture an important town in the Persian Empire such as Sardis convinced other subject people of the Persian Empire that the Persians were not invincible. Soon, the Greeks of the Hellespont, the Carians and the Caunians of the south-western coast,Cypriots and Scythians rose into revolt and plundered Thrace. The Athenian fleet even defeated the Phoenician fleet of the Empire near the island of Crete. 

However, these victories were short-lived. Darius launched a major counter-offensive recovering Crete by the end of the year and defeating the Carians, Hellespontine Greeks and Aeolians. Ionia was ravaged and Aristogoras was murdered by a Thracian. Darius concentrated his energies on Miletus, the cradle of the revolt destroying it completely and settling the bulk of its inhabitants on the Persian Gulf. Ionia was ravaged and the coastal islands were depopulated. The cities on the Hellespont and the sea of Marmara were burnt.

A year after the capture of Miletus, The Capture of Miletus, a play by the poet Phrynichos, was performed in Athens, reducing the entire amphitheater to tears. The Ionian Revolt, although ultimately a failure for the Ionian Greeks, was a touchstone for both Persia and Greece. As such, it marks the beginning of the Persian Wars.

=== Expeditions to Greece 492 - 490 BC===

Humiliated and Enraged by the rebellion of Greek city-states in Asia Minor, Darius dispatched an expedition under Mardonius across the Bosporus to reduce Thrace,Greece and Macedonia in the year 492BC. Mardonius was successful at first taking Thasos and invading Athos but an thunderstorm broke out killing 20,000 men. Seizing this opportunity, a Thracian tribe Brygi attacked the Persians killing a large number of them. The Persians, however, retaliated completely subjugating them. But Mardonius was unable to advance further and had to retreat.

A couple of years later Darius sent another expedition under Datis whioch followed the coast of the Cyclades and fell upon Eretria and Attica. Eretria was reduced and a large number of its inhabitants massacred. However, the siege of Athens failed completely with a Persian Army of 100,000 to 200,000 men facing a crushing defeat at the hands of 20,000 Athenians and Plateans in the Battle of Marathon.

==== Battle of Marathon 490 BC ====

The main historical account of the Battle of Marathon comes from Herodotus' Histories Book VI, paragraphs 102–117. Calculations as per the Julian Calendar suggest a date of September 12, 490BC for the battle.

Darius had sent a part of the navy under Aristapharnes which laid siege to Athens on the 12th of Sepmteber 490BC. Meanwhile, the Persian cavalry had already retreated. The Persian Army was arranged in a straight line close to the coast while the fleet was a few miles away at sea. Miltiades, a powerful politician of the Athenian Republic who had led Greek troops in the Ionian revolt led the Greek army.

The front of the Greek army numbered 1,625 men of whom 500 guarded the centre while the rest formed the sides of the formation. If the Persians had the same density as the Greeks and were 10 ranks strong then the Persian army opposing the Greeks numbered 16,000. men. But if the front had a gap of 1.4 meters between soldiers compared to 1 meters for every Greek and had a density of 40 to 50 ranks as seems to be the maximum possible for the plain—the Persian army had even fought in 110 ranks—then the Persian army numbered 44,000 to 55,000.

Prior to the commencement of the battle, runners were sent to Sparta to request the Spartans for their help. The runners reportedly ran an unbelieveable 200 kilometres in less than 36 hours.

When the battle began, the Greek centre made a ferocious charge at the Persian troops piercing the gaps between the troops. But when the Persian archers attacked the Greeks with a barrage of arrows, the Greeks retreated pulling the Persian troops in. When the Persians were close enough for the kill, the sides charged. The warriors who made up the flanks reportedly covered he one and half kilometres that seperated them from the Persian troops in less than 10 minutes. With no time to fire their weapons, the Persians fled. The Persian fleet was at a great distance from coast of Marathon. Unable to make their escape, the Persians lost miserably and over 6,000 soldiers were killed. 

The Battle of Marathon heralded a new dawn in the history of Perso-Greek relations. This battle, in particular, led to the commencement of the Persian Wars which lasted over a hundred years and culminated in Alexander's conquest of Persia in 331BC. However, the most imminent result of this battle was that it fuelled insurrections against Persian rule all over the Empire. It proved that the Persians could be defeated and commenced a string of Greek victories over Persia in land and sea.


=== Revolt in Egypt 487-486 BC ===

Still undeterred, Darius was making elaborate preparations for another invasion of Greece when rebellion broke out in Egypt. Darius hurried to the scene, but was soon struck by illness and died in 486 or 485BC according to some accounts at the age of 64.



=== Administration ===

It has always been the habit of West Asian countries to rebel at the slightest provocation that kingdoms often collapsed in a short time. Darius was the first one to find a solution to this problem and he devised a new system of government hitherto unknown.  This form of government not only sustained the Persian Empire for two hundred years but also contributed to the rapid expansion of the dominions. This system of governance was the decentralization of power through the appointment of provincial governors or satraps.

==== Satraps (Kshatras) of the Empire ====

The word satrap is the Romanized form of Old Persian &quot;Kshatra&quot; or &quot;province&quot; which is the Iranian counterpart of the Sanskrit &quot;Kshetra&quot;. It administrator was known as &quot;Kshatra-pava&quot; or &quot;protector of the satrap&quot;.

The duties of the Persian satrap (Kshatra-pava) were 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Collection and transmission of revenue
&lt;li&gt; Administration of justice
&lt;li&gt; Maintainence of Order
&lt;li&gt;General supervision of territory
&lt;/ul&gt;

This policy of establishing satraps 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; brought a sense of uniformity  with each satrap having a similar form of administration
&lt;li&gt; The imposition of checks and counterpoises over provincial governors and officials
&lt;li&gt; Equal distribution of authority amongst the provinces.
&lt;/ul&gt;

==== Taxation and Tribute ====

The mode of taxation employed often was left to the wishes and whims of the satrap who exacted the tribute. Generally, the exactions were made by land-tax. As far as tribute was concerned, the provinces usually paid a tribute of 150 to 1000 silver talents except in the case of the two satraps of India which furnished the Empire with vast quantities of gold and men. These were the richest provinces of the Persian Empire and yielded the highest tribute.

==== Population ==== 

The population of the Empire has been estimated at over forty million and these included people of various nationalities as Persians, Medes, Indians, Arabs, Mesapotamians, Turks, Africans, Egyptians, Phoenicians, Jews, Greeks and Scythians.

=== Legacy ===

Darius I is arguably the greatest ever monarch to have ruled Persia. Cyrus II may actually have been the one who established the Achaemenid Empire, but practically speaking, the Persian Empire owes its greatness to Darius I. He was the one who consolidated the Empire and brought his nation into direct conflict with Greece. The kingdom was a fledgling power, not much more than a barbarian state, ruled by semi-civilized ancients before Darius came to power. Darius tranformed it into an Empire and gave it a system of administration, rarely if at all, seen anywhere in the ancient world. Cyrus had been given the epithet &quot;the Great&quot; by Persians at a later stage. But Darius declares himself &quot;Kshaayathiya Vazarka&quot; or &quot;Great King&quot; in his inscriptions. It was obvious who deserved it more. It was definitely, Darius I the Great.

== Xerxes I 485-465 BC ==

[[Image:Persepolis_-_The_Gate_of_Xerxes.jpg]]

Xerxes was the son of Darius I and Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus the Great. His throne name in Old Persian was Khashayarshah which means &quot;ruler of heroes&quot;.

The reign of Xerxes was completely devoid of unnecessary adventures in unknown lands. His first campaign was again Egypt soon after the death of his father and he was extremely successful in putting an end to the rebellion and reducing Egypt. Another rebellion broke out in Babylon and he was able to quell this one too without much effort.


=== Wars with Greece ===

In 483BC, Xerxes sent a large expedition to invade Greece. A channel was dug through the isthmus of the peninsula of Mount Athos, provisions were stored in the stations on the road through Thrace, two bridges were thrown across the Hellespont. The Persian soldiers who invaded Greece were estimated to be over 2 million strong. 

The Persian troops crossed the Hellespont and laid siege to the city of Thermopylae.

==== Battle of Thermopylae ====

Various accounts exist of the Battle of Thermopylae between the Greeks and the Persians but even the oldest, by Herodotus, was written a full generation after the event, and none is entirely reliable. Greek accounts of the time say that Xerxes dispatched an army of 10,000 Medes to assault the Pass but it was cut to pieces on the very first day. He then sent an army of 20,000 Immortals, but they too failed. Accounts say that Xerxes sent an army of 50,000 on the second day but once again, they werent able to achieve any success. 

On the third day, with a crucial piece of information from a Greek traitor called Ephthalite, the Persians were able to sneak into Thermopylae. A skirmish followed.   In this struggle, Herodotus tells us that two brothers of Xerxes I fell: Abrocomes and Hyperanthes. Leonidas, the commander of the Greek army, also died in the assault.

The Persians won the battle and proceeded to take Athens. The body of Leonidas was captured by Xerxes, who, in a fit of rage, ordered it to be brutally mutilated and crucified.

==== Battle of Artemisium ====

On the same day that the Battle of Thermopylae was fought the Battle of Artemisium raged between the Greeks and the Persians. This battle brought a complete victory for the Persian fleet over the Greeks in the Greek waters. Following these two victories, the Persians laid siege to Athens. The Oracle at Delphi had earlier prophesied that the Greeks would be saved by a &quot;wooden wall&quot;. The defeat at Artemisium seemed to imply that this did not refer to the wooden hulls of the fleet, so the Athenians hoped that building a wooden wall around the Acropolis would save them from the Persians. However, as expected, the wooden wall was burnt by the Persians and the Athenians inside were massacred.

==== Battle of Salamis ====

The Delphic Oracle had also predicted ambiguously that Salamis would &quot;bring death to women's sons.&quot; In September 480BC, the Persian fleet met the Greek navy off the coast of Salamis island near Athens and the Battle of Salamis was fought. The Persian fleet was made of 800 ships while the Greek fleet was made of around 378 ships. However, soon after the battle began, a storm broke out which tossed the flimsy Phoenician ships of the Persians up and down. Ariamenes who commanded the Persians was killed in hand-to-hand combat and confusion followed.The battle was tightly contested and in the end, the Persians had to flee. Unable to provide for the troops in Greece, Xerxes led his army back across the Hellespont into Asia, leaving behind Mardonius. Mardonius once again recaptured Athens, but was defeated in the Battle of Platea and the Battle of Micale.

==== Battle of Plataea ====

After the Battle of Salamis, Xerxes I returned to Persia, leaving Mardonius in charge of the conquered Greek territories. Mardonius, through Alexander I of Macedon, asked for a truce with Athens, offering autonomous government and Persian aid in rebuilding their city. Athens rejected this and asked for Spartan assistance, though the Spartans were more interested in protecting the Peloponnese. Mardonius then recaptured Athens, but the Athenians once more rejected his offer of peace.

Mardonius fortified the Asopus river in Boeotia, hoping that the Greeks would be unable to unite against him. However, the Athenians sent 8,000 men and marched with the Spartan force to the pass over Mount Cithaeron, where they could successfully defend themselves from Persian raids. Mardonius sent cavalry charges led by Masistius to attack the Greeks, hoping to lure them onto the plain or to check whether his cavalry could successfully attack a phalanx on hilly terrain.[4] Masistius met resistance from the Megarans and Athenians under the command of Olympiodorus, in the centre of the Greek formation. Masistius was killed and his cavalry retreated. The Greeks began to move away from the pass towards the plain of Plataea where Mardonius had built a fortified camp, and where the Greek hoplites could fight more easily. The Athenians formed the left wing of the army, with the Spartans on the right and the Tegeans in the centre.

At this point, the Greek army numbered 80,000 men while the Persians are estimated to have numbered anywhere between 50,000  and 300,000 men. The Athenians and Spartans switched positions so that the Athenians would defend against the main Persian force while the Spartans would fight the Greek subjects within the Persian army. The Persians thought that the Greeks were retreating and attacked them. The Persians fought with their large heavy shields while the Greeks used long spears which gave them a tactical advantage. The Tegans attacked followed by the Spartans. Mardonius was killed and his successor Artabazus pulled back his troops.

==== Battle of Mycale ====

The Battle of Mycale was a turning point in the history of Greco-Persian wars and marked the end of Achaemenid intrusion into Greece. This was fought during the same period as the Battle of Plataea. The Ionian Greeks in the Persian army went over to the Greeks and the Persians suffered a crushing defeat. 

The Persians hastily evacuated Greece after this battle. Never again would they set foot on European soil.

==== Battle of the Eurymedon ====

In 477BC, the Greek city-states form the Delian League with Athens at its head. This was inaugarated as a defensive and offensive alliance against Persia. The first major offensive carried out by the Delian League was the Battle of the Eurymedon in 466BC.

Starting with 477BC, when the Delian League was formed, the Greeks launcdhed a major offensive to drive out Persians from Asia Minor. This led to the Battle of the Eurymedon in 466 BC when the Athenian general Cimon led a fleet of 250 ships against the Ionian cities. Most Greeks surrendered without resistance, however, Ionians of mixed Persian and Greek descent held out. The Athenian fleet was assisted by an Ionian fleet of 100 ships from the surrendered cities of Asia Minor. The Greek city Fasilida gave the stoutest resistance. However, this resistance was overcome in time and Persian hold over the Ionian cities of Asia Minor was completely lost.

Cimon then moved against the Persian fleet stationed on the Eurymedon river which resulted in a complete victory for the Athenian fleet. Persian rule over the Ionian cities completely disappeared with this battle.

=== Missing Later Years ===

Of the later years of Xerxes, little is known. He sent out Sataspes to attempt the circumnavigation of Africa. He left inscriptions at Persepolis, where he added a new palace to that of Darius, at Van, now in present day Turkey, and on Mount Elvend near Ecbatana. In these texts he merely copies the words of his father. In 465 he was murdered by his vizier, Artabanus, who raised Artaxerxes I to the throne

== Artaxerxes I 465 - 424 BC ==

Xerxes was succeeded by Artaxerxes I in 465BC. His name in Old Persian was &quot;Artakshasa&quot; which may be roughly translated as &quot;one who rules through truth (arta)&quot;. He was given the epithet Minuschir or (Greek) Longimannus because his right-arm is believed to be longer than his left. 

According to some accounts, Xerxes was killed by his eldest son Darius who tried to usurp the throne. But Artaxerxes, a younger son of Xerxes removed Darius and ascended the throne. Immediately after his accession, he killed Artabanus who made an attempt on his life.

=== Rebellions ===

Soon after Artabanus was killed, Bactria rose in rebellion under Artabanus, a younger brother of the king Hystaspes. But this rebellion was sternly put down. Simultaneous eruptions followed in Africa where the King of Libya Inarus overthrew the Persian satrap of Egypt, Achaemenes who was an uncle of Artaxerxes I. At the same time, an Athenian fleet under Cimon sent to help the Egyptians won a decisive victory near the coast of Egypt. After having hoped in vain for help from Sparta, Artaxerxes sent a relieving force under Megabyzus who set free the Persians beseiged in Memphis after a contest which lasted more than a year. The mutineers were beseiged at Byblos in the Nile Delta and forced to surrender in 454BC. The Athenian fleet faced a crushing defeat and was forced to retreat. Arsames was made the new satrap of the province.

=== Relations With Greece ===

As soon as Artaxerxes I ascended the throne, he commenced the practice of bribing city-states hostile to Athens in order to keep the Athenians in check and prevent the formation of a Greek confederacy. Athenians resorted to desperate measures as demanding tribute in the form of money from the members of the League instead of men or ships. Open hostilites commenced in 450BC when the Athenians lent their aid to an Egyptian revolt against Persia.

==== Battle of Salamis in Cyprus ====

The Battle of Cyprus or Battle of Salamis (in Cyprus) took place in 450BC near the coast of Salamis, a Greek city-state in the island of Cyprus. 

In 454BC, the Athenians made an unsuccessful bid to aid the Egyptian revolt. The insurrection was crushed and the Athenians lost a fleet in the attack. In 451BC, a truce was concluded between the warring Athenians and Spartans which enabled the Athenians to renew hostilities with Persia.

In 450BC, Cimon sailed into Cyprus with a fleet of 200 ships. He sent sixty ships into Egypt to aid the revolting Egyptians. Cimon beseiged the Persian stronghold of Citium in south-west Cyprus. The siege was completely successful though Cimon was killed in the battle. The Greeks did not press further and returned to the mainland.

In 447BC, the First Peloponnesian War commenced between the Delian League and the Boetian League which brought about a temporary truce between the Athenians and the Persians. The Peace of Callias was signed to this effect in the year 449BC.

=== Rebellion in Syria ===

Soon after the Peace of Callias, the Persian commander at the battle against Egypt, Megabyzus rose in rebellion against Artaxerxes for violating the terms of Inarus' surrender by killing him. He established a stronghold in Syria and defeated two Persian armies sent against him. However, peace was soon agreed upon by the opposing parties and the rebellion came to an end. 

During the last years of his reign, Artaxerxes faced the rebellion of Pissuthenes, the satrap of Sardis. The Athenians made an unsuccssful invasion of Caunia.  During the fag end of his reign, Artaxerxes was approached by both Sparta and Athens requesting his help in the Peloponnesian Wars. But no definite treaty seemed to have been arrived at.

=== Character of Artaxerxes ===

Artaxerxes I is often portrayed as an Emperor with a weak character. But historians and writers of the period have endowed lavish praises on him for his kindness and benevolence. Like his father, he supported building activities in the Empire. The construction of the &quot;Hall of 100 Columns&quot; begun in the reign of his father was completed under his supervision and patronage.

== Xerxes II 424 BC ==

Xerxes II succeeded his father Artxerxes I in 424 BC but reigned for a brief period of 45 days. He was the legitimate heir to the throne being the son of Artaxerxes nthrough his principal wife Damaspia. Very little is known about him. ostly from the writings of Ctesias. He was murdered by the orders of his half-brother Sogdianus forty-five days after his accession.

== Sogdianus 424 - 423 BC ==

Xerxes II was succeeded by his half-brother Sogdianus in 424BC. Sogdianus was an illegitimate son of Artaxerxes I. He ruled for a few months from Elam. Even during his time, Darius II (Ochus) another son of Artaxerxes I ruled from Hyrcania. 

Soon after the death of Xerxes II, Sogdianus usurped the throne and ruled for six months and fifteen days. In 423BC, after a short fight, Ochus, a son of Artaxerxes II killed Sogdianus and ascended the throne as Darius II

== Darius II 423 - 404 BC ==

=== Rebellion in Lydia and Caria ===

Soon after the accession of Darius II there was a rebellion by his brother, Arsites and Zopyrus, the son of Megabyzus. Darius sent two armies against them but both were defeated by Zopyrus with help from Greek mercenaries. Finally, Darius resorted to strategem and bought the mercenaries with Persian gold. Devoid of allies, Arsites and Zopyrus were forced to capitulate under pressure from advancing Persian forces. The duo surrendered under the pledge of protection but his wife Parsyatis persuaded Darius to disregard the pledge. Both Arsites and Zopyrus were mercilessly killed in violation of the pledge.

The revolt of Lydia, a satrap of Persia was another prominent outbreak. The rebellion was led by one Pissuthunes and had started in the reign of Artaxerxes I. Darius sent Tissphernes against him. Once again Lycon, the Athenian commander of the Lydian troops and Pissuthunes' Greek mercenaries were bribed  and switched sides over to the Persians. Pissuthunes was captured and put to death.

=== The Loss of Egypt ===

During this time, there was a rebellion in Egypt. Darius made an unsuccessful attempt to quell the rebellion resulting in the loss of Egypt. The revolt of Egypt is placed by Heeren and Clinton in B.C. 414, by Eusebius in B.C. 411, by Manetho in the last year of Darius Nothus, or B.C. 405. These indiscrepancies arise from the belief that Manetho considered Nepherites (Nefaorot) as the leader while some feel that the leader was Amyrtseus of the twenty-eighth dynasty.

=== Relations With Greece ===

Darius observed the affairs and political situation in Greece with a watchful eye and was keen to support one party against the other. The crushing defeat of the Athenian army in 413BC created news all over the Empire. Athens was reduced to a status of a minor power by this battle. The Persian satraps Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus  made overtures to Sparta and a formal treaty was signed between the Persian Empire and Sparta. The Persians followed a policy akin to the &quot;divide et impera&quot; or &quot;Divide and rule&quot; practised by the British in India, always supporting one city-state against the other.

=== Rebellion in Media ===

In 409 or 408BC, a rebellion broke out in Media which is described in detail by Xenophon. Terutichmes, who belonged to a noble family with a good standing and influence was the satrap of Media. He was married to Amestris, the daughter of Darius II. However, soon, he became enamored of his own half-sister, Roxana and desired to marry her. However, he could not do so while Amestris was alive and made secret plans to murder her. The conspiracy hatched by Terutichmes reached the ears of Darius II and he sent a certain Udiastes to secure the life of his daughter. Udiastes overwhelmed Terutichmes and 300 associates of his and slew him. His extended family was rounded up with the one exception of his sister Statira who was married to the Crown-Prince Artaxerxes Memnon and was brutally extinguished at the orders of the queen Parsyatis.

=== Darius II's character ===

Darius II was an extremely weak,incompetent and a wicked monarch and functioned as a mere puppet at the hands of his favorite wife, Parsyatis. His reign was ridden with palace intrigues, conspiracies and brutal executions.

== Artaxerxes II 404 - 358 BC ==

Artaxerxes II was the eldest son of Darius II but Parsyatis preferred her younger son Cyrus to her elder and persuaded the Emperor in his last years to appoint Cyrus as the heir-apparent. However, Darius was too weak to prevent Artaxerxes II from capturing the throne and crowning himself Emperor soon after his death in 404BC. 

Meanwhile,Cyrus returned to his satrapy in Asia Minor and plotted to take over the Empire. He found a cause of quarrel with Tissaphernes and utilizing this, he recruited an army of 13,000 Greek mercenaries focring Tissaphernes to report the matter to the Persian Emperor. 

Cyrus quitted Sardis in 401BC and with an army of over 100,000 Persian soldiers and 13,000 Greek mercenaries, he rapidly advanced through Asia Minor taking Cilicia,Phrygia and Syria. At last, when Cyrus entered Babylon, Artaxerxes decided to give battle and according to reports, took the field at the head of an army in excess of 900,000. A showdown took place near the banks of the Euphrates. When the battle began, the Greek mercenaries of Cyrus advanced at their Persian opponents forcing them to retreat. But Cyrus, unwisely, pitted the guards who protected him against the persona of Artaxerxes. Cyrus was pierced in the eye by a javelin and killed in the melee that followed.

=== Relations With Greece ===

After the death of Cyrus, Lydia and Phrygia were ruled by satraps who had a deep and bitter rivalry towards one another. They were willing to engage the support of one or more of the Greek city-states in order to increase their power and influence. Meanwhile, Sparta provoked the open hostility of the Persian Government by welcoming the &quot;Ten Thousand&quot; survivors of the Battle and supporting the independence of Asiatic Greeks.

As a result, the Persians allied with Athens against Sparta and invaded the Peloponnese in 393BC. The island of Cythera was occupied. The Spartans learnt their lesson and concluded peace with the Athenians, the Persians and the smaller Greek city-states. Sparta assured the Persians that the Greeks would never henceforth interfere with the Persian provinces in Asia. The Greek city-states meanwhile were to remain autonomous. Persia agreed to this peace in the year 387BC

=== The Cyprian Revolt 391 - 380 BC ===

Cyprus broke into revolt under Evagoras of Salamis who allied with the Athenians in 391BC. The Athenians agreed to supply them with men and materials.With assistance from Achoris of Egypt and Hecatomnus of Cadia they occupied Tyre and extended into Cilicia. The Persians sent Tiribazus with an army of 300,000 men and 300 ships. Evagoras fought bravely and the battle lasted six years. But in the end, the rebels were defated and forced to surrender. Evagoras was surprisingly pardoned and was given a high position in the administration.

=== The Cadusian Revolt ===

Around the same time as the Cyprian revolt, the Cadusian revolt broke out in Cadusia which was a part of the Great Emperor's dominions. However,Artaxerxes invaded their territory at the head of an army which is estimated at 300,000 foot and 10,000 horse. Artaxerxes suffered a crushing defeat and was contented to reach Persia alive.

=== Invasion of Egypt 375 BC ===

In 375BC, Artaxerxes, with the services of the great Athenian general Iphicrates invaded Egypt and surrounded Memphis. But the Persians delayed in investing Memphis and paid the price. The rains came and the river banks of the Nile were flooded forcing the Persians to withdraw.

=== Rebellions ===

As the king grew older and feebler, the provinces began to revolt. Ariobarzanes, satrap of Phrygia shook off the Persian yoke in 366BC and declared himself independent.  Cappadocia too broke into revolt. However, both Phrygia and Cappadocia were conquered and their satraps deposed. In 362BC, there was a general revolt of the western provinces of the Empire. The Persians resorted to bribery and bought the loyalty of the new satrap of Phrygia apart from one of their generals. The insurrection was crushed. Following this rebellion, Artaxerxes II died in 358BC at the age of ninety-four.

== Artaxerxes III 358 - 338 BC ==

Artaxerxes III was a cruel, despotic monarch who immediately after his accession killed all his relatives and other claimnants to the throne. He even destroyed the princesses cruelly. When he had got rid of all his opponents, Artaxerxes commenced the invasion of Egypt.

=== Egyptian Campaign and Rebellions 351 - 346 BC ===

In around 351BC, Artaxerxes embarked on a campaign to recover Egypt. The Egyptian pharaoh Nectanebo with the services of the Greek generals Diophantus and Lamius inflicted a crushing defeat on the Persians. Artaxerxes was compelled to retreat and postpone his Egyptian enterprise. Following on the heels of the Egyptians, leaders of Phoenicia,Asia Minor and Cyprus declared their independence.

In 346BC, Artaxerxes initiated a counter-offensive by deputing Belesys, satrap of Syria and Mezseus, satrap of Cilicia to invade Sidon. Both suffered crushing defeats at the hands of the Sidonese king aided by Greek mercenaries. So, Artaxerxes proceeded against Sidon in person at the head of 330,000 men and burnt the city to the ground. Forty thousand persons lost their lives in the conflagration.

Soon after the conquest of Sidon, Artaxerxes launched an invasion of Egypt. Nectanebo resisted with an army of 100,000 of whom 20,000 were Greek mercenaries. The Persian army completely routed the Egyptians and occupied the Lower Delta of the Nile plundering its temples and destroying the idols. Artaxerxes returned to Persia and spent the next few years effectively quelling insurrections in various parts of the Empire so that a few years from the conquest of Egypt the Persian Empire was firmly entrenched in the grasp of the Great Emperor.

=== Last Years and Death ===

In 340BC, Artaxerxes sent a large army to assist the Thracian prince Cersobleptes against the Macedon Emperor Philip (father of Alexander the Great). Philip was baffled and forced to lift the siege on Perinthus.

His violence and cruelty rendered him hateful to his subjects; and it is not unlikely that they caused even those who stood highest in his favor to feel insecure. Bagoas may have feared that sooner or later he would himself be one of the monarch's victims and poisoned him.

== Artaxerxes IV (Arses) 338 - 336 BC ==
 
Soon after killing Artaxerxes III, Bagoas raised the young Artaxerxes IV to the throne as a puppet while retaining actual control over the Empire. But as Artaxerxes grew older he refused to act according to the wills and whims of Bagoas and was expectedly murdered by the latter who now raised a friend of his, Condomannus to the throne with the title 'Darius III'

== Darius III (Condomannus) 336 - 330 BC ==

The same year that Darius III ascended the Persian throne, Philip of Macedon was assassinated and succeeded by his son Alexander. In 338BC, the League of Corinth had nominated Philip to lead an army into Persian territory to avenge the Greco-Persian wars and the destruction of the acropolis at Athens. But his life was terminated even before he could embark on his mission. So, the mantle of avenging the Greco-Persian wars fell upon Alexander and in 336BC, soon after ascending the throne, Alexander made preparations to lead an enormous expedition into Asia.

Meanwhile, soon after ascending the throne, Darius III punished Bagoas by forcing him to drink the poison that the latter had prepared for him. Having disposed the only inside threat to his sovereignty, Darius III concentrated his efforts on destroying the rising power of the Macedonians. 

At first, Darius was successful to some extent. His general Memnon from Crete entered the Hellespont and drove away the Macedonian occupants. But he was powerless to stop Alexander intrusion into the Persian Empire which began in  the spring of 334BC. The Persians suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Granicus and retreated. In 333 BC, Darius himself lead an army against Alexander and was defeated once again. In September 333BC, Darius suffered a third defeat at Gaugamela in present-day Iraq resulting in the Macedonian conquest of Persia. Darius fled to Ecbatana where he held court and tried to collect a Persian army for fighting the Greeks. But as he was planning to organize an invasion, he was murdered brutally by his general Bessus who took on the title Artaxerxes V. Alexander's invasion and the Greco-Macedonian wars are covered in great detail in the next chapter.

== Artaxerxes V 330 - 329 BC ==

In 330BC, the Persian general Bessas murdered the last Achaemenid Emperor Darius III and took on the title Artaxerxes V. This pretender to the Persian throne held court in Ecbatana for a few months before it was conquered by the Macedonians. Bessas was captured and crucified by Alexander as a punishment for the murder of Darius III. With this, the Achaemenid Empire ceased to exist.

== The Achaemenid Legacy ==

Persia, under the Achaemenids, was a world empire that dominated Eurasia for two centuries. At the height of its power and influence, the grandeur and splendor of the capital Persepolis was unparalleled. Fortunately, for us, a few monuments of the Achaemenid period have survived, like the 'Hall of a Thousand Columns' and the ruins of the palaces of Persepolis. This enables us to recreate the seat of the Imperial Government of the Shahs of Iran.

[[Image:Persepolis_06.jpg|right|300px]]

=== Persepolis ===

Persepolis rose in the middle of the 6th century BC in the reign of Cyrus. It is a city often identified with the Achaemenid Empire, for its rise and fall mirrored the rise and fall of Achaemenid fortunes. Most of the monuments in Persepolis, however, were constructed by Darius I, Xerxes I and Artaxerxes I. The city rose to spectacular heights in the subsequent period when it became the centre of lavish feasts, hunting festivals and religious ceremonies. Its inhabitants l;ed a life of luxury and leisure. Their pastimes included playing board games, dining and drinking. Persepolis was connected with the rest of the Empire by means of royal roads. The capital was supplied by means of artificial streams and reservoirs which helped create a garden in the middle of the Persian desert.

=== Royal Road ===

A system of well-built roads connected the capital Persepolis with the rest of the Empire. The most prominent among these was the 'Royal Road' which ran from Persepolis to Sardis the capital of Lydia.  It began in the west in Sardis (about 60 miles east of İzmir in present-day Turkey), traveled east through what is now the middle northern section of Turkey to the old Assyrian capital Nineveh (present-day Mosul, Iraq), then traveled south to Babylon (present-day Baghdad, Iraq). From near Babylon, it is believed to have split into two routes, one traveling northwest then west through Ecbatana and on along the Silk Road, the other continuing east through the future Persian capital Susa (in present-day Iran) and then southeast to Persepolis.

Communication was maintained through a system of couriers who relayed important messages across the Empire. These people seem to have been the predecessors of the      system. 

=== Society ===

Achaemenid Persian society was quite conservative compared to those of other cultures with a strict moral code in existence and severe punishments being imposed. Women were subjected to the veil and were often confined to their homes. They had little rights and their main duty was to serve the household.However, there have been instances when Persian women had successfully tackled these restrictions and risen from confinement to play a pivotal role in the Government and administration.Pantea who commanded the Immortal Guards of Cyrus the Great, Artunis who was the Spahbod (Lieutenant General)of Darius I the Great and Artemis who was Grand Admiral of Xerxes I are some of them.

=== Contemporary Perception ===

The Achaemenids have been perceived in modern times as the true standard bearers of Persianism and the Persian legacy. Secularists,Persian nationalists and monarchists have adopted Cyrus and Darius as symbols of their anti-theocracy movement against the Islamic republic. Tempers rose during the Gulf War when Iran fielded Cyrus,Xerxes and Darius as the symbols of the resistance movement in retaliation to Iraq's extensive use of Qadesiyyah as political propaganda. Today, Achaemenids are lauded for their greatness and tolerance and remembered with tear-filled eyes by Iranians destroyed by the ruthless policies of a theocratic state.

# His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is widely regarded as the foremost scientist in the field of consciousness and is considered to be the greatest teacher in the world today.  
# His Vedic Science and Technology, which unfolds the full potential of Natural Law in human consciousness as the basis of improving all areas of life, is regarded as the most effective program of human development.  
# His technique of Transcendental Meditation is the most widely practiced and extensively researched program for self-development in the world.  
# More than 600 scientific research studies conducted during the past forty-four years at over 200 independent universities and research institutes in 28 countries have validated the profound benefits of the Maharishi Transcendental Meditation program for the individual and for every area of society, including health, education, business⁰, industry, rehabilitation, defense, agriculture, and government.  
# Over five million people in all parts of the world and from all walks of life practice the Maharishi Transcendental Meditation program. Forty thousand teachers of the Transcendental Meditation Program have been trained so far, and more are continuing to be trained.  
# In addition, more than 100,000 people have learned the Maharishi TM-Sidhi℠ program and are daily practicing &quot;Yogic Flying,&quot; an advanced program of Transcendental Meditation that dramatically enhances all the benefits brought about by the Transcendental Meditation program for the individual, and creates a highly purifying influence in world consciousness.  
# Maharishi has held hundreds of World Peace Assemblies on all continents during the past forty-four years, with many thousands of people coming together to create coherence in world consciousness through the group practice of the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi programs (Yogic Flying program).  
# In 1986, on the basis of the rising Maharishi Effect—coherence in world consciousness resulting from his World Peace Assemblies—Maharishi inaugurated his program to create world peace by establishing a permanent group of seven thousand Vedic Scientists in Maharishi Ved Vigyān Vishwa Vidyā Peeth, Maharishi Nagar, India, to create coherence in collective consciousness on a permanent basis through the group practice of the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi programs.  
# As a result of the rising Maharishi Effect in world consciousness produced by millions of people practicing the Transcendental Meditation program throughout the world, and through Maharishi's World Peace Assemblies in all parts of the world, world peace is rising to be a permanent reality.  
# Over the past forty-four years Maharishi has established a worldwide organization with more than 1,200 centers in 108 countries.  
# Hundreds of books have been published about Maharishi's teachings. These have been translated into many languages and have been distributed globally.  
# Maharishi is one of the most videotaped personalities in history. There are more than 14,000 hours of video and audio tape recordings of lectures in Maharishi's international film and tape library.  
# Maharishi has completely restored the thousands-of-years-old scattered Vedic Literature for the total significance of its theory and practice, and has organized it in the form of a complete science of consciousness.  
# The Transcendental Meditation program is the subjective technology of Maharishi's Vedic Science of Consciousness.  
# Maharishi Vedic Science and Technology is a complete science and technology of consciousness; it is the complete science and technology of life, capable of raising all aspects of life to perfection.  
# The practicality of creating the supreme quality of life on earth—Heaven on Earth—through Maharishi Vedic Science and Technology has been amply verified during the past forty-four years by scientific research, which documents the benefits in every aspect of life—physiology, psychology, sociology, and ecology. It has also been substantially verified by personal experience, and by the authenticity of the ancient, traditional Vedic Literature.  
# The global achievements of these forty-four years, on the ground of tested knowledge, prompted Maharishi to launch a global program to create Heaven on Earth—life according to Natural Law.  
# The Heaven on Earth Project calls for the reconstruction of the whole world, inner and outer. The Maharishi Heaven on Earth Development Corporation has been established as a global organization to create Heaven on Earth.  
# Maharishi's knowledge, Maharishi Vedic Science and Technology, Maharishi's eternal Constitution of the Universe, which is present everywhere, and Maharishi's simple approach for everyone to enjoy life according to Natural Law are the foundation of Maharishi's global action to create Heaven on Earth and perpetuate it for all generations to come.  
# The revival of Vedic Wisdom through Maharishi Vedic Science and Technology and the establishment of Maharishi Vedic University, Maharishi Āyur-Veda University, and the Maharishi University of Management in many countries provide that perfect knowledge of Natural Law which will forever continue guiding mankind on the path to perfection—daily life in full accordance with Natural Law.  
# A review of all the scientific research on the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi programs reveals that the sequential unfoldment of pure knowledge and its infinite organizing power has brought about the experience of pure consciousness, has given rise to higher states of consciousness in the individual, and has purified world consciousness, as evidenced by the rising waves of  achievement of Maharishi's Movement throughout the world over the past forty-four years.  
# Maharishi's call to governments of the world and his offer of a practical formula for every government to come in alliance¹ with Nature's Government, to gain the support² of Nature's Government, and gain the ability to nourish everyone and satisfy everyone is so unique and unprecedented in the thousands of years of struggling history of governments that probably the political leadership of the world, working under stress and strain, could not believe that the support of Nature could be gained in a systematic, scientific manner by all.  
# Having realized that it is possible to free governments from problems and develop in them the ability to prevent problems, Maharishi decided to establish³ a Global Government of Natural Law, with its seat in every country.  
# The effect of the Government of Natural Law will be to raise the administration of existing governments through national law to the dignity of Global Administration through Natural Law.  
# In the context of the Absolute Theory of Government it is enough to mention the ideal⁴ of government available in the Global Government of Natural Law. However, it is necessary to mention that the relationship⁵ of the government of every country with Maharishi's Global Government of Natural Law will be so elevating and nourishing to every government in the world that every Head of State will enjoy the full support of Natural Law, and his government will enjoy the ability to prevent problems and will substantiate the new definition of government provided by Maharishi's Absolute Theory of Government.  
# Maharishi's practical program is to quietly⁶ establish life according to Natural Law without requiring change in any area of the existing administration, which is based on the national constitution of the country.  
# This global initiative to irrevocably change the course of time in favor of peace and happiness for all mankind places Maharishi on a most supremely exalted level of rulership, which far surpasses the wisdom or administrative skill of any sovereign ruler in the world that history has ever recorded.
# The establishment of Maharishi's Global Administration⁷ through Natural Law will lead the administrative quality of every government in the direction of perfection so that every government functions on a par with the absolute administration of the universe, the Government of Nature, which is universally nourishing to all life.  
# Ṛk Veda places this supreme skill of leadership in the hands of Brahm, the Ultimate Reality:

# Yatīnām Brahmā bhavati sārathiḥ  
# (Ṛk Veda, 1.158.6)  
# Brahmā, the total potential of pure knowledge and its infinite organizing power—the lively Constitution of the Universe, Natural Law—becomes the charioteer of all activity.  
# Ṛk Veda assigns supreme rulership to that self-referral quality of consciousness, the total potential of natural Law—Brahm.  
# The total potential of Natural Law conducts the activity of those who have identified their intelligence with the infinite organizing power of pure intelligence at the level of self-referral consciousness.  
# Every custodian of Maharishi's Absolute Theory of Government will have access to this enormous intelligence and power in his own self-referral consciousness—in his own Transcendental Consciousness—in his own physiology.⁸   
# Ṛk Veda, the Constitution of the Universe, will be enlivened in the heart of everyone, and, through a group of Yogic Flyers, an indomitable influence of harmony and peace will be generated in national consciousness, which will influence the whole collective consciousness of the world. Indomitable Maharishi Effect—positivity and harmony—will be maintained in world consciousness, generation after generation.  
# Maharishi in the world today is a cosmic figure caring for the well-being of all mankind and establishing a system to perpetuate life according to Natural Law, the cherished ideal of every government.  
# One wonders whether there could be a greater ruling intelligence than the one that is available in the world today in the form of Maharishi, who is making life on earth heavenly, and who is making Heaven on Earth a reality.  
# Maharishi attributes his achievements to Shrī Guru Dev, His Divinity Brahmānanda Saraswatī Jagadguru Bhagwān Shankarāchārya of Jyotir Math, Himalayas—most illustrious embodiment of Vedic Wisdom in the eternal tradition of Vedic Masters.  
# During the past forty-four years the purity of world consciousness has been steadily rising; life according to Natural Law has been steadily rising.  
# It is satisfying that with the blossoming of this Absolute Theory of Government, the world is witnessing the signs of a new awakening in every field in the direction of fulfillment.  
# Now is the time for the world to witness the full glory of life according to Natural Law—to experience the full dignity of life in peace, prosperity, and happiness, with enlightenment and fulfillment in daily life.  
# This is Maharishi in the world today, a quiet guardian of all nations. Through his brilliance in the field of knowledge and administration, every government now has the opportunity to actualize the supreme purpose of government.

However, it is necessary to mention that the relationship⁵ of the government of every country with Maharishi's Global Government of Natural Law will be so elevating and nourishing to every government in the world that every Head of State will enjoy the full support of Natural Law, and his government will enjoy the ability to prevent problems and will substantiate the new definition of government provided by Maharishi's Absolute Theory of Government.  
# Maharishi's practical program is to quietly⁶ establish life according to Natural Law without requiring change in any area of the existing administration, which is based on the national constitution of the country.  
# This global initiative to irrevocably change the course of time in favor of peace and happiness for all mankind places Maharishi on a most supremely exalted level of rulership, which far surpasses the wisdom or administrative skill of any sovereign ruler in the world that history has ever recorded.
# The establishment of Maharishi's Global Administration⁷ through Natural Law will lead the administrative quality of every government in the direction of perfection so that every government functions on a par with the absolute administration of the universe, the Government of Nature, which is universally nourishing to all life.  
# Ṛk Veda places this supreme skill of leadership in the hands of Brahm, the Ultimate Reality:

# Yatīnām Brahmā bhavati sārathiḥ  
# (Ṛk Veda, 1.158.6)  
# Brahmā, the total potential of pure knowledge and its infinite organizing power—the lively Constitution of the Universe, Natural Law—becomes the charioteer of all activity.  
# Ṛk Veda assigns supreme rulership to that self-referral quality of consciousness, the total potential of natural Law—Brahm.  
# The total potential of Natural Law conducts the activity of those who have identified their intelligence with the infinite organizing power of pure intelligence at the level of self-referral consciousness.  
# Every custodian of Maharishi's Absolute Theory of Government will have access to this enormous intelligence and power in his own self-referral consciousness—in his own Transcendental Consciousness—in his own physiology.⁸   
# Ṛk Veda, the Constitution of the Universe, will be enlivened in the heart of everyone, and, through a group of Yogic Flyers, an indomitable influence of harmony and peace will be generated in national consciousness, which will influence the whole collective consciousness of the world. Indomitable Maharishi Effect—positivity and harmony—will be maintained in world consciousness, generation after generation.  
# Maharishi in the world today is a cosmic figure caring for the well-being of all mankind and establishing a system to perpetuate life according to Natural Law, the cherished ideal of every government.  
# One wonders whether there could be a greater ruling intelligence than the one that is available in the world today in the form of Maharishi, who is making life on earth heavenly, and who is making Heaven on Earth a reality.  
# Maharishi attributes his achievements to Shrī Guru Dev, His Divinity Brahmānanda Saraswatī Jagadguru Bhagwān Shankarāchārya of Jyotir Math, Himalayas—most illustrious embodiment of Vedic Wisdom in the eternal tradition of Vedic Masters.  
# During the past forty-four years the purity of world consciousness has been steadily rising; life according to Natural Law has been steadily rising.  
# It is satisfying that with the blossoming of this Absolute Theory of Government, the world is witnessing the signs of a new awakening in every field in the direction of fulfillment.  
# Now is the time for the world to witness the full glory of life according to Natural Law—to experience the full dignity of life in peace, prosperity, and happiness, with enlightenment and fulfillment in daily life.  
# This is Maharishi in the world today, a quiet guardian of all nations. Through his brilliance in the field of knowledge and administration, every government now has the opportunity to actualize the supreme purpose of government.

0. Maharishi Corporate Development Program™ is the most effective program available to create stress-free management and stress-free industry; to create stress-free executives and employees; and to promote creativity, productivity, health, and well-being in industry.  

Hundreds of corporations and businesses throughout the world have increased their productivity and profits and have improved the health, creativity, and well-being of their executives and employees through the Maharishi Corporate Development Program.

&lt;br&gt;1. 1990—Maharishi's Year of Alliance with Nature's Government.  

&lt;br&gt;2. 1991—Maharishi's Year of Support of Nature's Government.

&lt;br&gt;3. In 1976 Maharishi inaugurated the World Government of the Age of Enlightenment. Maharishi's Administration through Natural Law—Global Rām Rāj—celebrated on January 12, 1993, developed its organizational structure in 1996, on Guru Pūmimā Day, when Maharishi established Global Administration through Natural Law, materializing the concept of Maharishi's World Government of the Age of Enlightenment.

&lt;br&gt;4. This is the ideal of the Natural Law Party in 85 countries (ever-increasing).

&lt;br&gt;5. Every national flag will fly with the cosmic flag of Maharishi's Global Government of Natural Law.

&lt;br&gt;6. Maharishi realized the intensity of ignorance prevailing in the political leadership of the world. In his desperate mood to save the world from suffering, he finally decided to produce the effect irrespective of governments.

He decided that governments, functioning according to man-made constitutions, completely ignorant of the eternal Constitution of Natural Law, are not able to understand the proposals, plans, and programs to create perfect administration through support of Natural Law. He decided to take a self-sufficient path that would not in any way depend on governments.

Maharishi decided to create a Global Government of Natural Law to render all governments as really sovereign governments in their own countries, and to quietly raise the efficiency of every government on a par with the Government of Nature and thereby substantiate the purpose of government in every country.

A global awakening of the failure of governments everywhere, and a global demand from the world press for something new in the field of politics, attracted Maharishi to the field of politics.

Maharishi was moved by the logic that the democratic system prevailing in the world invites anyone to enter into government and serve the nation through his knowledge and ability.

The discovery of the Constitution of the Universe within the human physiology has given a very solid foundation and strength to Maharishi's global political program to transform the field of politics and establish the rule of Natural Law in all parts of the world.

Every responsible politician in any country should now turn to the royal road of Administration through Natural Law (which is already quietly administering the activity of all systems and structures of the body), and this will mean that the national government will quietly receive the full support of Natural Law, and positivity and harmony will prevail in national consciousness.

There will be conflict-free politics and a problem-free government. National energy will not be wasted in oppositions of political parties, and all the national intelligence will be used for progress.

&lt;br&gt;7. Maharishi formally established the organizational structure of &quot; Maharishi's Global Administration through Natural Law&quot; on Guru Pūrnimā Day, July 30, 1996.

&quot;It is a very, very great delight for me that I have a chance now, after Pūjā to Guru Dev, to express to you all, for the world of all times, the establishment of this global organization which has now been established with the blessings of Guru Dev, as the Prasād of Guru Pūjā.

&quot;This global organization will establish administration through Vedic Knowledge in the center of every country, and this will enliven the organizing power of Natural Law for the government and give invincibility to the government, peace and happiness to the people, and will give nourishing sovereignty to every sovereign nation.

&quot;Now, through this global organization, I am inviting all governments who have been living under the influence of other nations to enjoy real freedom—no free country in my world should be dependent on any other country: 'Get into this knowledge of Natural Law, enliven Natural Law in your people, enliven Natural Law in the collective consciousness of your nation, and you will be the custodian of Natural Law.'

&quot;This I am saying to every government: 'You will hold the balance of power in the world even if you are a small country. As long as you are a free country, as long as you have power to make laws, as long as you have a currency, establish this center of Total Knowledge—Brahma-Sthān—in the center of your country, and as knowledge has organizing power, with the bliss of Total Knowledge—Brahmānanda—lively in your country, the infinite organizing power of Natural Law will be at your command—you will command authority in the family of nations—you will hold the balance of power in the world.'

&quot;My global organization that is being set today is to give sovereignty, real invincibility—unrestricted authority of sovereignty—to every government.&quot;—Maharishi

'''''Solanum dulcamara''''' (Bittersweet, Bitter Nightshade, Blue Bindweed, Climbing Nightshade, Fellenwort, Felonwood, Poisonberry, Poisonflower, Scarlet Berry, Snakeberry, Trailing Bittersweet, Trailing Nightshade, Violet Bloom or, Woody Nightshade) is a species of vine in the potato genus Solanum, family Solanaceae. It is native to Europe and Asia, and widely naturalised elsewhere, including North America, where it is an invasive problem weed. It occurs in a very wide range of habitats, from woodlands to scrubland, hedges and marshes.

The common name bittersweet is also used in some regions for some species in the genus ''[[../Celastrus/]]'' (the Staff vines, family Celastraceae), e.g. American bittersweet (''[[../Celastrus scandens/]]'') and Oriental bittersweet (''[[../Celastrus orbiculatus/]]'').

==Description==
This is a semi-woody herbaceous perennial vine, which scrambles over other plants, capable of reaching a height of 4 m where suitable support is available, but more often 1-2 m high. The leaves are 4-12 cm long, roughly arrowhead-shaped, and often lobed at the base. The flowers are in loose clusters of 3-20, 1-1.5 cm across, star-shaped, with five purple petals and yellow stamens and style pointing forward. The fruit is an ovoid red berry about 1 cm long, soft and juicy, poisonous to humans and livestock but edible for birds, which disperse the seeds widely.

==Growing Conditions==
The vine  often grows in semi-shaded areas.
&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==

&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
As with most ''Solanum'' species, the foliage is also poisonous to humans, but it is used in homeopathic medicine and herbalism. Its main usage is for conditions that have an impact on the skin, mucous membrane and the membrane (synovial membrane) around the joints. Bittersweet is considered to be an important remedy for treating herpes infections and allergies.

==Maintenance==

&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==

=Modscopes=

A modscope is a reference to a group of modules which are related to each other in some way, usually by author. The modscope is followed by a full stop ('.') and then the module's name. For example, 'Brl.Blitz' is the same as saying, &quot;the module name Blitz from the module scope Brl&quot;.

* &lt;s&gt;Some explanation on module scopes.&lt;/s&gt; Also, how to compile your own modules. [[User:Otus|Otus]] 11:48, 3 June 2007 (UTC)

: Got the modscopes covered. [[User:Psyced|Psyced]] ([[User talk:Psyced|talk]]) 17:24, 23 August 2009 (UTC)

=Modscope capitalization=
Officially, the 'Brl' modscope is fully capitalized ('BRL'), but some pages were already at '/Brl/*', so I just renamed all references of 'BRL' in my list to 'Brl'.
If an admin could, please rename/move existing '/Brl' pages to '/BRL', and notify me so I can change the lists (or just do it). [[User:Psyced|Psyced]] ([[User talk:Psyced|talk]]) 17:29, 23 August 2009 (UTC)

=Templates for module documentation=
It would be much faster if we could have a template for Methods/Fields/Consts/Globals/Functions/etc. I don't know much about templates, and I don't think I can create a page for one to start testing.
Could an admin setup some templates or create the pages for them? [[User:Psyced|Psyced]] ([[User talk:Psyced|talk]]) 05:01, 24 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page has some instructions about using [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:DynamicPageList/old the version of DPL] that is available on Wikibooks. 

for an example of how DPL works, see [[:Category:Weed profiles]] and [[:Category:Garden plants]] (both of which are subcategories of [[:Category:A Wikimanual of Gardening]]), and you wanted to have a new page that lists all plants that are often weeds, but sometimes grown in gardens.

The DPL code for this is as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;DynamicPageList&gt;
category=Weed profiles
category=Garden plants
order=descending
namespace=0
&lt;/DynamicPageList&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which yields:

&lt;DynamicPageList&gt;
category=Weed profiles
category=Garden plants
order=descending
namespace=0
&lt;/DynamicPageList&gt;

(open the edit window for this page and you'll see the trick)

==Pointers, discoveries==
#If a page is linked from a DPL page, the DPL page will '''not''' appear on the &quot;what links here&quot; special page.
#&quot;order&quot; doesn't seem to work, at least for subpages

==Questions==
#How to make a list appear so that only the subpages are listed, rather than the mainpage? 
##Similarly, how can the alphabetical sorting be switched so that it runs off the subpage?
##Can the list be configured to appear in italics or boldface?
#How to make lists that include pages in Category:X ''or'' Category:Y&quot; (or better yet in any one of 10 or more categories, etc.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''DirectX''' is a Windows hardware abstraction. It's primarily known for it's use in graphics; however it has many other applications, as it was made with media and entertainment in mind. To program with DirectX, you need to understand its basic layout. First of all, DirectX is a group of components; including Direct3D, DirectDraw, DirectSound, and DirectInput. Most of these components have been depreciated and are no longer developed because they are simply wrappers for Win32 functions. However, they still have their uses.

==Prerequisites==
Learning to program with DirectX is hard. That being said, I will explain what is required and expected of you by this book.

First and foremost - you must have the DirectX libraries installed. These may be distributed with compilers, or, if you use one, the IDE (basic DirectX functionality is generally provided with Windows IDEs). If you don’t have these libraries, or want more recent distributions, you can obtain the SDK here:
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=4b78a58a-e672-4b83-a28e-72b5e93bd60a&amp;DisplayLang=en
This is a very large development kit (400 MB), complete with examples and useful utilities.

Secondly - You must know a language that can link with C++ libraries. Most native languages and several managed languages can do this, but it's easiest if you can just use C++. This book will not go over basic programming concepts, or even some of the advanced concepts which are frequently used by DirectX, such as pointers and abstract classes. Don't come back without knowing these, or you won't understand what we're doing or why we're doing it.
The DirectX 9 book does not cover Window creating or message handling.

==Layout==
DirectX is not one single program or library. DirectX is a group of components which are independently developed. To list a few, these include Direct3D, DirectDraw, and DirectMusic. These components provide access to a software interface for communicating with the hardware with a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model Component Object Model (COM)] library. This wikibook will be designed around that concept and split into a section for each version and component. Some of these components are updated regularly (such as Direct3D), so there will be a section for each version. The ones which are depreciated will be listed under the last version that they were upgraded.

That said, now we can begin to learn how to program with DirectX.

==Sections==

* [[/9.0/DirectSound|Direct Sound]][[File:25%.svg]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Children and infants don in reverse?==
I've never heard this, and it's not in any FA manual I've ever seen, so unless it's referenced, I'm going to assume it's not standard. Remember that this is ''first aid'' not paramedicine.
&lt;pre&gt;This is only to be done on ADULT or YOUNG ADULT patients! YOUNG CHILDREN and INFANTS are to be assessed in reverse.&lt;/pre&gt;
[[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] 18:56, 3 June 2007 (UTC)
:Actually, I heard it many times.  Young children and infants (which should be held by a parent while assessing) will tend to allow you to do more and be less hesitant if you start from their feet.  By starting from their heads, they tend to be more defensive whereas when you start at their feet, they feel less vulnerable. It is in the ARC Emergency Response Book.  [[User:Mike6271|Mike6271]] 04:05, 7 July 2007 (UTC)
::I can understand the rationale for children, though I disagree. The point of starting at the head is that those injuries would be most serious - a child's 'comfort' is less important than finding the most serious injuries first, so therefore start at the head. That rationale makes even less sense for infants. Also, the head-to-toe should be replaced by a simple &quot;Are you hurt anywhere else?&quot; and a visual once-over in victims that can tell you reliably whether they're hurt anywhere else or not. So a stroke victim, for example, can't tell you reliably whether they're injured anywhere else, so do a head-to-toe. An unconscious victim needs a head-to-toe. But if it's an asthma victim? Not needed - if they're hurt anywhere else, they'll be able to tell you. So any victim that gets a head-to-toe isn't going to be in any sort of condition to complain in any case. As for moving it to [[First Aid/Advanced Topics]], I disagree - the head-to-toe is an integral part of the secondary survey, and is definitely included in Standard. ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:20, 7 July 2007 (UTC)

== Checking for underlying causes ==

This entire section was in [[First Aid/Vitals]], so I moved it to a more appropriate location. I'm wondering if it should be kept at all; it certainly goes beyond SFA standards and looks much more like something a paramedic or first responder might be doing. [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] 17:01, 4 July 2007 (UTC)

:As also posted on Mike's talk page, but this is something i train my first aid teams with, partly because it helps them understand some underlying causes, partly because it gives them something to do whilst waiting for an ambulance (because let's face it, there isn't that much you can do you a 'sick person') and also because each of those diagnostic tests is very simple to perform (looking for colour, clubbing and oedema is pretty simple).  Agree its not really vital signs (got carried away), and happy for it to sit here or as an extended skills module.  [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 17:14, 4 July 2007 (UTC)

== Lawsuit ==
It should be made clear that by doing the assessment you can get a lawsuit thrown against you for sexual assault.  When you are actually doing a head-to-toe assessment, you are getting awfully close to the the patient and they may feel uncomfortable, especially if you only learned to do it from Wikibook's First Aid book. [[User:Mike6271|Mike6271]] 04:05, 7 July 2007 (UTC)

Maybe this could be moved to advanced first aid.  It is far from basic first aid and involves rather &quot;touchy&quot; parts which only a trained responder should be doing.  Basic first aid should be more of a &quot;Does this person want my help?  Does this person need my help?  Is there anything I know how to do for the person that will help them?  Is there something that a medically trained individual can do for this person that I cannot?  How do I reach that person?&quot; [[User:Mike6271|Mike6271]] 04:10, 7 July 2007 (UTC)

:See above for reply re: moving to [[First Aid/Advanced Topics]].
:Legal liability is not generally a concern due to ''Good Samaritan'' legislation, where it exists. Even in jurisdiction where that legislation doesn't exist, case law will probably protect you. Victims getting a thorough head-to-toe aren't going to be in a position to complain while it's being done. As for a lawsuit after the fact... I suppose you could put in a note if you want, but I think that'd be an overreaction. First aiders should definitely give a 'running commentary' as they do it though. &quot;I'm going to check the rest of your body for any other injuries. Do you hurt anywhere else? I'm just looking for anything out of the ordinary, and it looks like we're doing ok for now. Does this hurt? OK that's good....&quot; and so on. So they have advance warning of what you're going to do, and they always know what you're doing. So that needs to be added as well. ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:26, 7 July 2007 (UTC)

:It does mention sensitivity to gender issues in the article, but no harm in reimplying the consent issue. As for moving, definately not.  This is basic first aid. [[User:Owain.davies|Owain.davies]] 13:18, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

::For checking the pelvis, for the EMT curriculum, it states that you should push them together, then only if there is no pain for that, then push down, otherwise you can cause severe bleeding by fracturing the pelvis more.  After rethinking this, I still believe it should be put in Advanced Topics, as there is a lot to check for while you do this, and by just discussing it in wikibooks, more confusion can be caused on how to do it since they don't actually get to practice.  Running your hands over is a lot different than palpating.  The rapid trauma assessment is done on conscious patients too.  Also, to do it properly, the person needs to be, for the most part, completely naked to do a through exam.  [[User:Mike6271|Mike6271]] 02:52, 15 October 2007 (UTC)

:::Keep in mind that this is just a textbook - I'm not assuming (and I don't think it should be assumed) that anyone will read this and think they can do first aid - that would be totally irrational, especially considering all the warnings about getting appropriate hands-on training.
:::If you want to change the way the pelvis check is done, by all means, be bold - I see no problem with the way you've described it above. I disagree however with one of your other two points - that the head-to-toe should be moved to the advanced section. A head-to-toe is most certainly ''not'' an advanced technique (though there is a section for [[First Aid/Extended Assessment]]). If you like, add more content to the advanced section on assessment. I'm still intending to add some stuff on assessing spinals, I just haven't gotten around to it.

{{Gothic}}
This book was written for the purpose of teaching people a language. The reader of this book is not required under any circumstance to know grammatical terms in order to learn this language through this book. However, it is helpful to know grammatical terms so that you can advance more quickly through the book. Some grammatical terms will be foreign to those who are proficient in English grammar, and those terms will be explained as the book progresses. Even if a person who wants to learn Gothic does not know any grammatical terms whatsoever, they should still be able to do so using this book. However, it does help. It also helps if you know another German Language, and also some of the shifting laws that are encountered in this group such as Grimm's Law and (in particular) Verner's Law.  We will, however, cover these laws in this book.

The Gothic Language is itself an old one, and a mysterious one at that. The language has never been entirely reconstructed. We can only theorise about certain parts of the language which are not present in the Codex Argenteus and the few other surviving Gothic texts.  Keep this in mind.

When learning a language, it is best to think of it in relation to your own. Do not think of the grammar first. If there is a strange letter, think of it as if you were learning your alphabet for the first time - associate each letter with a sound. If you are learning vocabulary, do not think of the words as Gothic words, but ones that are English used in Gothic. Think of the grammar of the language last, but make sure to pay attention to it. This will make the language much easier to learn for you, because you are not stressed to think that you are learning a completely different language, but merely learning new vocabulary and a new way of saying things.

== Creating the New Book ==

Once you have your outline, there is a minor decision to be made as to how you are going to create the new book. There are two basic options:

#You can move the page with the outline from your user namespace (if you have a page at all) into the main module namespace at the proper location. To do this, click the &quot;'''Move'''&quot; tab at the top of the page, and write the title of your book (using proper title caps) into the &quot;To new title&quot; box and click the &quot;'''Move page'''&quot; button.
#You can create a new page from scratch, and copy+paste your outline into it, or type in the outline. To do this, type the new title of your book into the search box on the left and click &quot;'''Go'''&quot;. This will bring you to the empty page where you can start editing like normal.

In either situation, a book could already exist at that location. In the case of a page move, you will not be allowed to move one page over top of another page. In the case of creating the book from scratch, when you click the &quot;'''Go'''&quot; it will take you to the existing book instead of to a blank page. You should either find a new title for your book, or else you should consider contributing to the existing book instead.

== Moving the Outline ==

If you move the outline from your user namespace, the entire page history will be visible. This means that all the experimenting that you did on the outline will be available to people, including experimenting that you might have done which you don't want other people to see. Also, you will need to remove from the outline any &quot;metadata&quot; that isn't supposed to be part of the book. This can include comments and notes, questions, or options that don't need to be in the book.

== Starting from scratch ==

If you want to start the page from scratch, without moving the outline from a preexisting location, you need to double-check that there is currently no book with that name (which there shouldnt be, if you have already done your research). If no page exists, you can jump right into it, or else you can employ a semi-automated tool for the purpose such as one of my [[User:Whiteknight/Book Creator|Book Creation Gadgets]].

=== Book Creator Gadget ===

Type the name of your new book into the text box and click &quot;Create new Book&quot;. If you see the words &quot;NEW PAGE AVAILABLE&quot; at the top of the page, there is no page with that name and you are free to create your new book. If you do not see those words, the page already exists and you should not write your new outline there without checking it out first.

'''Double-Check Your Title before you click &quot;Save&quot;'''. If you have a typo in this box, that's the name of your book and it will need to be changed. Make sure you type the title carefully in this box, following proper ''title-caps'' guidelines.

{{User:Whiteknight/Book Creator Gadget}}

Remember that if there is currently a book with the same title as your intended new book, you might be better off just contributing to and improving the existing book instead of starting a new one.

      <comment>/* Tertian Harmony */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Tertian Harmony ==
I never heard of tertian harmony until reading this title. Is tertian harmony important enough to teach in such an early part of the book? [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] 23:25, 3 June 2007 (UTC)

:Tertian harmony is the harmonic practice of all Western music (except atonal music). It means &quot;3rds&quot; harmony. Harmonic structures derived from stacked thirds. Triads. And seventh chords, ninth chords, 11th chords, on and on. It's the formal name for all harmony built of thirds. And yes, it's important to know this. In later periods of practice, quartal (built of 4ths)and quintal (built of 5ths) chords began to appear.</text>

=== An Introduction into the Gothic Language ===
The Gothic Language was a language spoken by an ancient Germanic tribe known as the Goths. As such it is a Germanic language, extending from the same general family as German, Dutch and English. Because of its relation to these languages, you will notice that some words will be look and mean something similar to a modern counterpart (this is called a cognate). However, Gothic is the only thoroughly documented East Germanic language - the only extinct branch of the Germanic languages.

Despite the fact that Gothic shares the same family as German and English it is very different from modern Germanic languages, as its words inflect (or change their ending to determine their meaning in the sentence) rather than the meaning being mostly derived from word order like English. It also carries some features unique to the East Germanic language stem which are not present in other stems of the Germanic language tree. In a sense, it is closer to Latin in syntax.

Gothic itself was originally written in a variation of futhark (runes). However, it eventually shifted to its own alphabet invented by the Gothic bishop Wulfilas, who based the alphabet on the Greek alphabet, with some letters modified from the old futhark alphabet, and possibly the Latin alphabet. Wulfilas himself translated the Bible into Gothic, the surviving pages of which make up most of the extant Gothic texts we know today. 

==== Crimean Gothic ====
The original Gothic language in essence died before the end of the Dark Ages. However, in the Crimean region of Ukraine, a small number of Gothic speakers survived until the 17th century. Surprisingly, less is known of Crimean Gothic than the original Gothic language, with a small list of words given to a French ambassador being our only real window into the language.

==== Purposes of Learning Gothic ====
Gothic is an ancient language which will give you insight into the evolution of Germanic languages through history. It is a unique language, being the only well documented East Germanic language. Gothic may also be used as a stepping-stone to learning [[Latin]] or [[Greek]], which have many principles which are shared with Gothic. If you are interested in history, and particularly the history of the Goths and other German tribes, it might be of use for you to learn Gothic.

=== An Introduction to this Book ===
This book will teach you the grammar of Gothic, starting with the alphabet and pronunciation of words, followed by an introduction to the basic grammar, followed by progressively more difficult grammar. In later chapters, the concept of the neologism will be introduced, and finally a number of advanced exercises testing everything taught - with excerpts from Wulfilas's own translation of the bible.

The basic format of each chapter is an introduction to the vocabulary, followed by lessons with exercises, and overall exercises at the end of the chapter. In later chapters, you may be asked to create some of the words that you require to translate.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background==
This game is a matter of quick thinking and even quicker reaction time. It's ''not'' the type of game you'd play to relax. It is a mix of slapjack and war.

==The Rules==
There are many variations, but the basic goal is always the same - get all the cards. People take turns putting down a card, and at certain points one may slap the pile to gain those cards. Special rules apply when a royal card (J, Q, K, A) is played.

===Royals===
When a person plays a royal, the next person gets a number of &quot;chances&quot; to play a royal themselves. Otherwise the person who played the face-card gets the pile. If a royal is played by the second person, then the third person now has a number of chances, and so on...

*Ace - 4 chances
*King - 3 chances
*Queen - 2 chances
*Jack - 1 chance (!)

===When You Can Slap (in order of commonness)===
*Doubles - two of the same rank in a row.
*Sandwich - two of the same rank, with one card in between.
*Wildcard - if you see the wildcard, go for it! The problem with this is that when it happens to be your last card, it gets annoying. (Usually the 10 if there are no Jokers)
*Consecutive - two or three cards that are each one apart. (e.g. 7, 8, 9)
*Book, Big-Mac, etc - two cards of the same rank, with two cards between. 

*Please note that this is a limitted list of optional rules, and that many more exist in practical usage.

===&quot;Burning&quot;===
If you slap at the wrong time, or, for example, you see a double but someone else puts down another card before you slap, you must &quot;burn&quot; one or more cards, and put them in the bottom. 
Other penalties exist, including the inability to slap until someone else has, but this is the most basic.


===Running Out of Cards===
According to some rules, once you're out of cards, you're permanently out. In others, you can &quot;slap in&quot;. The problem with this is that if you have no cards, you can't burn any. So &quot;negative&quot; cards are counted. At a certain point, such as -5 cards, the person is permanently out.
Additionally, players not originally in the game may &quot;slap in,&quot; but are not told the rules in use.

==Etiquette==
*Remove all rings.
*Cut your fingernails.
*Don't &quot;hover&quot; your hand close to the pile.
*When you put down a card, flip it out so the other person sees it before you.
*Speed is key, try not to deaden the pace over squabbles, etc.
*Don't pound with your fist, karate chop the pile, etc.

==Strategy==
*can't see me
:Instead of flipping toward your opponent, flip to the side.
*Touchy
:Touching the cards because you think they're yours is generally equivalent to slapping them. So when the opponents are at their last chance for a royal, slap right after they put down their last card. If they didn't play a royal, and there was nothing to slap, it's yours anyway. If they didn't play a royal but there was something to slap, you just won a lot of cards. If the opponent ''did'' play a royal, there's a 25% chance it was the same as yours, so it might be slappable.
*Plan Ahead
:Keep a mental note of whether you have back-to-back face cards in your deck. If you don't, always slap after you have played a face card and the next player has used up his/her chances. Even if your opponent's last card was a face card, you have nothing to lose &amp;mdash; you know that your next card (to be burned) is a number card. Note: if you do have back-to-back face cards, then you run the risk of burning a face card.
*Happy Slappy
:If you're desperate (and willing to antagonize other players), slap every single card played. This is especially useful if there are many rules (and thus many chances) or if the burning level is low.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mao is a card game that can be described as &quot;Uno for sadists&quot;. As many experienced players say, &quot;The only rule I can tell you is this one.&quot;

==The Rules==
The point of the game is to get rid of all your cards, following specific guidelines. If you don't play correctly, other players are allowed to give you penalty card(s). Other than this, due to the secretive nature of the game, the rules vary widely. The following rules are not definitive; they are merely examples.

===The Beginning===
Players are dealt a certain number of cards, usually 5-7. The cards may not be touched until the dealer says &quot;The game of Mao has now begun,&quot; and a card from the deck is placed in the center, similar to Uno.

===Allowed Cards===
You are allowed to play cards that are the same number or suit as the card below. Only one card can be played per turn.

===No Talking===
Except to give penalties, and during a point of order.

===Point of Order===
If you wish to speak, e.g. to argue a penalty, you must call a point of order. Cards may not be touched during a point of order. To end the point of order, the person who started it must say &quot;End point of order.&quot;

===Special Cards===
*Spades - if you place a spade, you must say &quot;(Face number) of spades&quot;
*8 - the player order is reversed.
*7 - you must say &quot;have a nice day&quot;. If the next player also plays a 7, (s)he must say &quot;have a very nice day&quot; and so on.
*3 - the next player gets his/her turn skipped
*9 of Diamonds - The player must say &quot;Thats the badger&quot;
*In some variations, if playing a card such as a jack, queen, king, or ace on top of one another you must say &quot;its in the blood&quot;

===Other Penalties===
*Telling the rules to those who shouldn't know... oops.
*Giving a false penalty.
*In some variations swearing can be penalized
*Holding cards during Point of Order
*If a player says Mao when he/she has not finished or in the middle of play, a penalty of five cards apply due to &quot;Taking the name of our glorious leader in vain&quot;

===One Card Left===
When you have one card left, you must say &quot;Last Card&quot;

===Winning the Game===
Once you win, you must say &quot;Mao&quot;. Now you may deal yourself back in and put a new rule in effect.

===Adding Rules===
Once a player has achieved Mao and left the game, they may draw back in and introduce a new rule. The new rule must not explicitly clash with the original rules or provide an unfair advantage. Some examples of new rules may be: A player must do something specific when they play a certain card, e.g.: Grunt, say a certain phrase or action, a card can only be played if it is conforming to a numerical order or sequence, e.g.: odds and evens, fibonacci, prime numbers. Rules can also be based off any form of nonsense. A player might be asked to make a silly noise corresponding with a card if a rule regarding noise is in effect. Most of the time, rules are only restricted by the rulemakers own imaginative insanity.

===The Next Game===
The winner becomes the dealer for the next game, and gets to make a new rule. After playing for a while with the same people there may be 10 or more new rules to remember!

Have fun! Be creative! And don't be ''too'' mean to the newbies!

=== The Gothic Alphabet ===
There are three scripts which Gothic is normally written in. The first is the Ulfilan alphabet, invented by the bishop Wulfilas. Gothic was also written in Elder Futhark, and in grammar primers the Latin alphabet is used. The alphabets this tutorial will focus on using are the Ulfilan and the Latin alphabet.

'''Note:''' Two letters have been removed for this lesson, as they merely represent numbers.

==== Consonants ====
Consonants - as far as this book is concerned - are all the letters in the alphabet which do not represent vowel sounds. Unlike vowels, they require articulation of various parts of the mouth and lips.

==== Diphthongs ====
Ulfilas never differentiated between some of the diphthongs, so the only way to memorise the pronnounciation of these words is to memorise them using the Latin transliterations.

You will also notice, as you advance through the language, that some words will end abruptly without a vowel, as is the case in the word figgr (meaning finger). Attempt to pronounce words such as this as if there isn't a vowel between the two consonants; the required vowel will come naturally to you.

=== Numbers ===
Like Ancient Hebrew and Ancient Greek, letters are assigned corresponding numerical values. Two letters of the Gothic alphabet were also used to specifically refer to numbers. An [[wikipedia:interpunct|interpunct]] is inserted before and after a number to differentiate it from a normal word. Right now, it is not necessarily important to know what numbers correspond to what letters. Numbers will be dealt with in a later chapter.

Nevertheless, this table shows the letters in their proper order.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Sounds like p in Futhark

Hwair is a difficult letter to wrap your head around without a good description of the sound. It sounds similar to the Scottish &quot;ch&quot; Lo&quot;ch&quot; (if you approximate this to a k, it is actually pronnounced as a light hissing noise) with a &quot;w&quot; attached to the end of it.

=== Sound Changes ===
Certain letters of the alphabet will change sound in certain situations.
* Bairkan will change sounds from {{IPA|/b/}} to {{IPA|/β/}} when in-between two vowels or diphthongs.
* Dags will change sounds from {{IPA|/d/}} to {{IPA|/ð/}} when in-between two vowels or diphthongs.
* Giba will change sounds from {{IPA|/ɡ/}} to {{IPA|/ʒ/}} when in-between two vowels.
* Giba will change sounds from {{IPA|/ɡ/}} to {{IPA|/x/}} after a vowel, but only if it isn't considered a diphthong (see below).
* Hagl will change sounds from {{IPA|/h/}} to {{IPA|/x/}} when ''not'' in-between two vowels.
* Winja will change sounds from {{IPA|/w/}} to an {{IPA|/ɪ/}} when it is used as a vowel after a diphthong, long vowel, or consonants not following a vowel (with Hagl an exception).

=== Diphthongs ===
Now that you know the basic sounds of the alphabet, we can examine the sounds that Gothic creates with two or more letters. Luckily for you, there are less of them than in English. These sounds are unmarked on the traditional Gothic alphabet, but can be determined by other letters around it. Note that there are two other variations on 𐌰𐌹 and 𐌰𐌿 which are not currently discussed here, and have a harder time trying to be pronnounced by English toungues.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Diphthong
!IPA Pronnounciation
|-
|𐍃𐌺
|{{IPA|/ʃ/}}
|-
|𐌰𐌹
|{{IPA|/æ/}}, {{IPA|/aɪ/}} {{IPA|/eɪ/}}
|-
|𐌰𐌿
|{{IPA|/ɑ/}} or {{IPA|/aʊ/}}
|-
|𐌹𐌿
|{{IPA|/ju/}}
|-
|𐌲𐌲 *
|{{IPA|/ŋ/}}
|-
|𐌴𐌹
|{{IPA|/eɪ/}}
|-
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Compounding certain consonants with Giba after it, particularly Quairþa and Lagus, will produce this sound. Be aware of this. As a side note, &quot;𐌲𐌲𐍅&quot;, is pronnounced {{IPA|/ŋw/}}.

==== Determining when to use the correct sounds for 𐌰𐌹 and 𐌰𐌿 ====
This comes down to stress, as can be shown by the forms for ai - ai, ái, and aí, and au - au, áu, and aú. At times it also comes down to the letter which comes before it:
* aí, which represents a sound which approximates {{IPA|/æ/}}, only occurs before r, h, and ƕ.
* ái, which represents {{IPA|/aɪ/}}, generally occurs before consonants
* ai, which represents {{IPA|/eɪ/}}, generally occurs before vowels
* aú, which represents {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, only occurs before r, and h.
* áu, which represents {{IPA|/aʊ/}}, generally has no recognizable pattern
* au, which represents {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, generally occurs before consonants

=== Other General Rules ===
* Assume that a vowel is short unless it becomes before 𐌷(and not 𐌸), as in that case it will be long.
* If you encounter an Eis with two dots on top, it will mean that you should separate the letter from the syllable. It also occurs in words whose first letter is Eis. When working in the Latin alphabet, it will not be destinguished.
* Aiƕus is always pronnounced long.
* The letter thorn is always used to represent the &quot;th sound&quot; when using the Latin alphabet rather than the &quot;th&quot; sound, which has a double meaning for both the thorn (þ as in tee'''th''') and eth (ð as in '''th'''en). The Eth sound is only represented by Dags in certain situations.

== How to Install ==

{{User:Whiteknight/Color|Red|Warning:}} This template is deprecated and will no longer be maintained or updated.
{{User:Whiteknight/Gadget Instructions 2|Print Version Creator|ff2=yes|ff3=yes|ie7=yes|ie6=yes|safari=yes|chrome=yes|opera=yes}}

=== Known Issues ===

;Safari &amp; Chrome (Webkit): Opening an embedded edit window does not work. You must &quot;Display&quot; the text and copy+paste it into another edit window.

== About This Gadget ==

This gadget produces a print version from provided text. It converts wikitext from a book TOC into a printable version. Notice that it does not convert plain text, it must be a properly formatted TOC. TOCs with complex or non-standard formatting may not convert properly, and will need to be edited.

The following wikitext:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 * [[/Page 1/]]
 === Sub Heading ===
 * [[/Page 2/]]
 * [[/Page 3/]]
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

Will be converted to the following Print version text:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 {{Print chapter heading|Page 1}}
 {{:BookName/Page 1}}
 
 {{print unit page|Sub Heading}}
 
 {{Print chapter heading|Page 2}}
 {{:BookName/Page 2}} 
 
 {{Print chapter heading|Page 3}}
 {{:BookName/Page 3}} 
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

The templates {{tlx|print unit page}} and {{tlx|print chapter heading}} are print-only formatting templates that create special pages, page breaks, and headings for different purposes.

== How to Use This Gadget ==

Here are a brief set of instructions on how to use the '''Print Version Creator'''. For more help, ask [[User talk:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]].

=== Get the TOC Text ===

First, you need to load the text of the TOC into the gadget. There are two methods to do this:

#Enter the name of the TOC page in the edit box and click '''Load'''.
#Click '''Show''' to display a textbox, and enter the text to convert in the box.

Using option 1, if you load an existing TOC, the text of that page will be inserted into the textbox. Clicking '''Show''' will display the text of the page for you to edit. It is recommended that you remove formatting, including templates, images, categories, tags (noinclude, includeonly, nowiki, etc), magic words (NOTOC, FORCETOC, etc) and tables. The gadget can try to remove some of these things, but the algorithm is not perfect.

=== Converting the Text ===

Once you have a TOC loaded into the textbox, you can click the '''Convert''' button to produce the printable version text. Once you have converted the text, you have two options:
#'''Display'''. Display the printable version of the page, for copy+paste.
#'''Edit'''. Produce an edit window, with the printable version code already loaded. Edit the code and press &quot;Save page&quot; to create the PV.

The '''Display''' button will display the completed text of the printable version. If you notice problems, you can click '''Show''' to view the TOC text, make any necessary changes, and click '''Convert''' again. The '''Edit''' button will display an edit window for the page &quot;BOOKNAME/Print Version&quot;, with the text of the printable version already loaded into the edit window. You can make any necessary changes, and then click '''Save page''' to save the printable version.

;Notice:'''Edit''' does not work in Safari. '''Display''' and all other functionality should work in all other browsers.

== To Do ==

*Add ability to post a {{tlx|Print version}} notice on the front page of the book.
*Account for nowiki, noinclude, and includeonly tags 
*Account for text-formatting (bold and italics)
*Account for tables
*Handle external links in single brackets and unbracketed
*Fix bugs in the conversion algorithm
*rearrange buttons to look better

== Version History ==

*3.05 A number of small fixes, added unit pages, etc.
*3.03 Nearly-perfect IE support
*3.02 Improved IE support
*3.01 Minor fixes, added partial support for IE
*3.00 Complete rewrite, using Gadgetscore v2.0. same functionalty but better code.

&lt;p&gt;To create your new book, follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Check to make sure that the book and the template do not already exist&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt; The book or template may already exist. If the book already exists, you should contribute to the existing book, instead of creating a new book. If the template already exists, you may want to consider renaming your template to [[&lt;a href=&quot;/wiki/Template:%2_/Page&quot;&gt;Template:%1/Page&lt;/a&gt;]]. If either the page or the template exist but are not being used, you may want to attempt to merge the existing contents into your new book, or else move the existing contents to a new location (remember to update all links, as necessary).  
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create your table of contents.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;small&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;/wiki/%2&quot;&gt;%1&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create your new book Table of Contents (TOC), you may use Whiteknight's &lt;a href=&quot;/wiki/User:Whiteknight/Book_Creation_Gadget&quot;&gt;Book Creation Gadget&lt;/a&gt;, or you may click &lt;a href=&quot;/wiki/%2&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; and create the TOC manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create your page navigation template.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;small&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;/wiki/Template:%2&quot;&gt;Template:%1&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create your new template, you may use Whiteknight's &lt;a href=&quot;/wiki/User:Whiteknight/Template_Creation_Gadget&quot;&gt;Template Creation Gadget&lt;/a&gt;, you may use one of the predefined templates at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Whiteknight/Book_Foundry#Header_Templates&quot;&gt;Whiteknight's Book Foundry&lt;/a&gt;, or you may create the new template from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create your book's page category.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;small&gt;(&lt;a href=/wiki/Category:%2&quot;&gt;Category:%1&lt;/a&gt; See &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Categories&quot;&gt;Wikibooks:Categories&lt;/a&gt; for help.)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the category page, write that the category is used for the pages in your book, and possibly link it to a larger subject category (if you can't find an appropriate one, ask at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Staff_lounge/Project_Chat&quot;&gt;Staff Lounge&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Add your book to the appropriate &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:All_bookshelves&quot;&gt;bookshelf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;small&gt;(See &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Bookshelves&quot;&gt;Wikibooks:Bookshelves&lt;/a&gt; for help.)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt; To do so, select the correct bookshelf from the list, and enter the following line of code to the proper place in the bookshelf:&lt;br&gt;&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt; &lt;code&gt;{{bi|%1}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Or:&lt;/dl&gt; &lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;code&gt;* [[%1]] {{stage short|00%}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;The choice of how to add the book to the bookshelf is dependent on the way other books are added to that shelf.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Properly categorize your book.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Make sure to add the following templates to your book, according to the instructions at &lt;a href=&quot;/wiki/WB:CCR&quot;&gt;WB:CCR&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{Alphabetical}}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{DDC}}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{LOC}}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{Shelf}}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Add your book to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Template:New&quot;&gt;Template:New&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;To do so, read all the instructions, and add the following line to the top of the list:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;mdash; [[%1]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional help, check the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Help:Contents&quot;&gt;Wikibooks Help Pages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Whiteknight/New_Book_Guide&quot;&gt;Whiteknight's New Book Guide&lt;/a&gt;, or leave a message on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:Whiteknight&quot;&gt;Whiteknight's talk page&lt;/a&gt;.

      <comment>Added stew, Jewish and boiled cats.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Ethiopia|Cuisine of Ethiopia]]

'''Shiro wat''', sometimes '''shiro wet''', is a traditional Ethiopian Jewish pea stew.

==Ingredients==
* ½ cup chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* 2 spoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (optional)
* 4 spoon [[Cookbook:Berbere|berberei]] (a spice mix with [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|red pepper powder]])
* 4 spoon ''shiro powder'' (made from different cereals and beans, typically [[Cookbook:Pea|split green peas]])
* 2½ cups [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Procedure==
# Take a medium-size cooking pan, add the onion and cook for 1 or 2 minutes.
# Add the oil, and after 1 minute add berberei, then cook it for 4 or five minutes (use water if it tries to stick on the pan, and stir regularly). 
# Add 2½ cups of water.
# When the water boils, add the shiro carefully stirring it in the pan; it should not make lumps. Then cook it for 5 minutes, stirring it regularly.
# Finally, add salt and the butter, and after 2 or 3 minute remove it from the heat.

It can be served hot or cold with [[Cookbook:Injera|injera]].

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Shiro powder can be bought from Ethiopian grocers.
* Alternatively, split green peas can be used. Just extend the simmering period until the peas are tender and fall apart.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Arabic alphabet is a consonantal alphabet; vowels are not fully represented. It also has a very rich calligraphic history. 

A word such as           كتاب may seem like a scribble to the beginner, and may seem not to be composed of letters. It is, they are simply connected to each other. The first letter is ''kaaf'' it looks like this كـ . The second letter in the word is ''taa'', it looks like this (تـ ). The third letter is ''alif'' : It looks like this: ا . The last letter is ''baa'' it looks like this بـ.

As you might have noticed, Arabic is read from right to left, down the page. The word كتاب spelled ''kaf ta alif ba'', means book it is pronounced &quot;kitaab&quot;.


==Exercise 1==
Give the names of each letter, start at the right.
كـ ، تـ ، ا ، بـ ، تـ ، ا ، بـ ، تـ

==Exercise 2==
Write the Arabic letter that best represents the first sound in the following words:

#cave
#tape
#coconut
#bill
#apple
#ant

=Answers=
==Ex.1==
kaf, ta, alif, ba, ta, alif, ba, ta

==Ex.2==
#كـ
#تـ
#كـ
#بـ
#ا
#ا

I would not advice anybody to study this module until it has been revised by a native. There are some things there I think need a lot of looking into. --[[User:S.Örvarr.S|S.Örvarr.S]] 06:33, 4 June 2007 (UTC)

This new layout is horrible, it should be returned to the older one with the title and exactly how it was before &quot;Swifts&quot; edits. --[[User:Girdi|Girdi]] ([[User talk:Girdi|talk]]) 13:08, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

The best Wikipedia overview is probably the Danish article [[w:http://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islandsk|Islandsk]], at least concerning grammar. It might be a good idea to translate and expand it. 

And yes, what we have here isn't even an embryo of a book.

      <comment>Adding comment on cdr missing return statement.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;So-called lambda expressions or anonymous inline functions can also be created in Lua. They are similar to the &quot;ordinary&quot; functions described above in almost every way.&quot; This is inaccurate, since ''all'' functions in Lua are anonymous. They are just assigned into th function &quot;name&quot; variable in the syntax used earlier on this page. I think this page needs heavy editing, just not up to it now, myself. [[User:Otus|Otus]] 09:54, 4 June 2007 (UTC)

Another thing to note is for things like the CDR function.  In Lisp, that returns the tail of the original list, not a copy of the tail.  If you hold a reference to the original list and the tail, and then modify something at the end of the list (changing the '3' to a '4', for example), then both lists will contain the modified value. - James

---

Also related to the CDR function, it is missing a return statement. - Anton.</text>

      <comment>Added Indian usage</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{technique}}

The act of tempering is done by gradually increasing the temperature of one recipe component by the addition of another. 

To achieve this gradual increase of temperature, you drizzle the hot component into the cooler component while constantly mixing the cooler ingredient.  If your container is sufficiently large, you may continue adding the hot component to this container, else you should bring the temperatures as close as you can, then whisk/mix the cooler components into the hotter.

Tempering is often done where eggs or yogurt are used as a thickening agent (i.e. in custards and sauces), since a sharp increase of temperature will cause the eggs to cook prematurely resulting in a lumpy texture or yogurt to curdle.

The same principle might be used when the addition of one recipe component might rapidly change the other, such as adding a large quantity of something acidic to something containing milk products.

==Indian Usage==
Tempering may also refer to the '''chaunk''' or '''tadka''', a process used in a number of Indian dishes such as [[Cookbook:Tadka dhal|Tadka Dhal]]. This process refers to deliberately browning whole spices in very hot oil, which is then used to either fry ingredients for the dish or to garnish the dish immediately before serving. The process of tempering roasts the spices, liberates essential oils, and enhances the aromatic quality of the dish.</text>

      <comment>/* Creation of Christianity */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Creation of Christianity==
Catholicism was the major religion during the Middle Ages.  It was a sect based off the teachings of Jesus Christ and spread like rapid fire throughout Europe.  Jesus Christ was a man that was said to be performing miracles and healings. Many said the healings that took place could only be performed by the Lord. People from all over came to see if they could receive a miraculous healing for themselves or their loved ones. Christianity and the good news that followed started to grow, and more people were becoming supportive of all that Jesus taught. John 4:4-42, John 4:28 Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, 29&quot;Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?&quot; 30 They came out of the town and made their way toward him.&quot; The Roman Empire felt threatened by this new influence.  They outlawed Christianity throughout their empire.  Anybody who was found practicing Christianity was persecuted.  Cruel punishments were used to enforce the strict restrictions on religion.  Jesus was crucified, nailed to a cross, and died.  People continued to follow Jesus.  Thinking of him as the messiah, they were confident that he would rise again. Jesus’ followers formed the Christian Church.  Catholicism is a branch of Christianity.

==Formation of the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Church==
Before there were popes, there were two bishops that lead the Catholic Church.  There was the Bishop of Rome and the Bishop of Constantinople.  The Bishop of Rome wanted power, and he proclaimed that he would become the leader of the Catholic Church, the Pope.  The Bishop of Constantinople didn’t agree with this.  He thought that the Church was being run how it should.  He wanted to keep the church the same, and keep himself at the top position in the church.  The new proclaimed pope excommunicated the bishop.  The bishop of Constantinople formed a new church, it was called the Eastern Orthodox Church.  The Bishop of Constantinople became the pope of his new church.  These were the only two branches of Christianity that existed during the Middle Ages.

==The Catholic Church==
Catholicism soon became the major religion in all of Rome, which was most of the known world.  
The ruler of the Catholic Church was called the Pope. The Pope was decided by Catholic Church members and officials.  Since almost everyone in Eastern Europe was Catholic, the Pope had a lot of responsibility. The Pope had so much power that he and various kings started to have conflicts over power.  At this point in time, everybody’s goal in life was to get into heaven.  All empires, kingdoms, and villages focused on religion.  The Pope had the power to decide if you were going to go to heaven, or if you were going to Hell.  Kingdoms started to have more faith in the Popes word, then in their rulers word.  Kings started to worry that they were losing the respect, and the clutch over their kingdoms. As the Popes power grew to the extreme, sometimes he would abuse his abilities.  This could be anything from asking for to much money, or excommunicating people for miniscule reasons. To be excommunicated means to be cast out of the Church and sentenced to Hell.  There were many rules that went along with being a member of the Catholic Church.  You had to give money, crops, and dedication to the Pope and Catholic law.  There were also sales that raised money to go to the Catholic Church.  People were often pressured into participating in these sales.  An example of this is the sale of indulgences.  During this “sale,” people would by passes that lessened their time in purgatory.  Purgatory is the place where Catholics believe people go to work of their sins before being admitted into heaven.

==Tithe and the 1/10 Rule==
The 1/10 also known as tithe was a big thing in the middle ages. The 1/10 rule took place in the 1200s. Christians mostly used it. Farmers would have to give 1/10 of their harvest. Average people would give 1/10 of their food and land. Foods like milk, eggs, meats, wood, and wine. These were types of items people gave. All these things were given to the church.  They were also given to the class above you. This created inequality. The lowest class never got any of the 1/10 given; they only have to the higher classes keeping them poor. The rich kept getting richer because the poor supplied them. All items were stored in special barns. Priests were the people who collected the goods. All social classed gave to the church except the pope. The practice of tithe is linked to the giving of a tenth of Abraham's possessions to The Prince of Salem and the high priest of god according to the bible. Because of the 1/10 rule, the church gained a lot of power and was very important in the middle ages.

==Religious Tensions during the Middle Ages==	
The Catholic Church had so much power, that you can imagine that they had many conflicts with other religions.  The tensions were rising between the Jews, Muslims, and Christians.  They all had the same holy land.  This place is called Jerusalem.  To the Christians, Jerusalem is where Jesus lived and preached.  To the Jews, Jerusalem holds a main temple.  It is also considered the holy land, the land of milk and honey, by the Jewish faith.  To the Muslims, Jerusalem is one of the two holy cities where Muhammad, their profit, preached.  The other city that is considered holy by the Muslims is Mecca.  The Muslims had control of Jerusalem at this time, and the Christians were determined to take it.  The Pope let out the word that the Catholic Church needed an army to take their holy land.  Anybody who joined the army was promised that they would go to heaven.  This was the start of one of the biggest series of wars in history.  It would be mostly the Muslims verse the Christians in a clash of swords, cultures, and life styles.  On the way to war Jews were killed by the Catholics because the Catholics were determined to kill for their religion.  These were the crusades.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Japanese Feudalism==

Feudalism was not unique to Europe. In Japan, an analogous system was being developed. 
Japanese feudalism stretched from the twelfth through the nineteenth century. Both government systems were based on land.

Like in Europe, the emperor would give land to daimyo, or great lords. The Japanese emperor’s had only a limited power. He was just a powerless head of the government. A king is similar to an emperor and a lord was comparable to a daimyo. A shogun was a powerful military leader who was higher in the hierarchy than daimyo. Although technically the Emperor is the head, the shogun was the one who made the actual decisions, but usually with the Emperor’s consent. 
Peasants were similar to noumin. Peasants made up 90% of the population, which included farmers and craftsmen. The peasants were divided into a series of classes, with farmers being the highest class and merchants being the lowest.  
During the early 17th century, the rulers of Japan started to follow a policy of seclusion. They suspected that traders, merchants and missionaries wanted to bring Japan under the control of European powers. Except the Dutch and the Chinese, all foreigners, traders and merchants from other countries, and missionaries faced restrictions. They also ordered some foreigners to leave Japan. Still, even during the period of seclusion, the Japanese continued to gain information and knowledge about other parts of the world.
Feudalism lasted much longer in Japan than in Europe, not disappearing until the 1800s. Although the feudal systems of Europe and Japan were similar, their cultures were very different.

==The Samurai==
[[Image:Samurai.jpg|150px|]]
The knights of medieval Europe were very similar to their feudal counterpart in Japan; the samurai. Both warrior groups followed a detailed code of honor. Chivalry was the code of conduct for the knights of Europe, and for the Samurai the code was known as Bushido. Both codes of honor talked about respect and modesty, but also required fearlessness and loyalty. Knights fought for their lords and in return the lords gave the knights land, which was called a manor. The samurai, on the other hand, fought for their lord in return for food like grains and rice. Another similarity between samurai and the knights is that they were both respected by their cultures for their dedication and hard work. Knights and samurai were also trained to treat people with respect and honor, especially women. A knight’s life consisted primarily of training and fighting, as did the samurai’s life. The type of residence a samurai was allowed to own depended on his lands and income, in other word, his status. The samurai lived in longhouses, these longhouses were split into apartments and a normal arrangement was to have a gateway with a row of rooms as its upper floor. At the other end of the social pyramid, the daimyos, or nobility, maintained large mansions and castles on their lands. The samurai had many types of equipment for war, such as a war mask called menpo. They also had armored sleeves called kote. Other names for armor that the samurai used were kabuto, which was the samurai’s helmet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the year 1215, King John signed a document known as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta Magna Carta] or “Great Charter” in Latin. It was created by Nobles who were angry and tired of the Kings’ doing as they pleased and not respecting the laws and rights of others. The document allowed the Nobles to gain more power by limiting the Kings’ rights so they could not do as they pleased. The definition of the Magna Carta is: a document listing rights that a king could not ignore. Laws such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus Habeas Corpus], which allowed people to only be put in jail when they did something wrong, were put into effect to stop the kings’ from taking advantage of lower classes. The Magna Carta led to the [http://www.hyperhistory.net/apwh/essays/cot/t2w07magnacarta.htm English Parliament], which still exists today and made the stepping-stones for today’s modern democratic governments. A system of checks and balances, which was set forth by the Magna Carta, is an idea still used today by the United States Government. Overall the Magna Carta impacted most forms of government including the idea of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy democracy], the English Parliament, and even today’s [http://www.usa.gov/ United Sites Government].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Spread of the Plague==
The Black Death was one of the most deadly diseases. It killed 137 million in 3 major outbreaks. The 1st outbreak was called Plaque of Justice it occurred in 542 – 543 A.D, killed 70,000 people in the city of Constantinople. 2nd outbreak, the focus of this research, was the most deadly, and it was often   called the Black Death. It occurred in Asia and Europe, but mostly in Europe,  about 75 million Europeans were killed during the four years (1347-1351) from the plague. The spread of the Black Death was very dangerous. The Italian traders first contracted the Black Death in trade with Asians.  As these traders headed home, they carried the disease with them to trading ports in Italy. They brought rats on the boats that carried fleas with the disease.   The disease followed traders and their cargo further west and north and by 1349 the disease had spread to all of modern Europe and its trading ports.&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Pestilence spreading 1347-1351 europe.png|250px|Spread of the Bubonic Plague Through Western Europe: 1347-1351]]&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When traders came from Asia to Europe, there were rats on their boats with infected blood. Fleas bit the rats, so they got infected. When an infected flea bit a person, they got infected with the plague.  Some forms of the plague were spread through the air, others were spread from bites.  If you breathed in infected air, then you would catch the virus.  People didn’t have enough knowledge about the plague to know that the rats carried it. Instead of eliminating the rats, they fed them and gave them shelter. Three forms of the plague were the bubonic plague, the air spread form, and the form spread through bites.  
To describe this whole big plaque would be a negative impact thing to different cultures or countries but in a bad way. You’re bringing then a disease to kill people. A cultural diffusion is when new ideas are brought to one culture borrowed from another. How this is negative is you are bringing the disease to different countries and killing people. Now that everybody is dying causing the population to go down.

==Effects of the Bubonic Plague==
The Black Death made many changes in Europe. The Black Death killed about 1/3 of the European population, and also killed 70% of the people who caught the disease. People thought that by burning the diseased bodies it would help stop the spread of the disease. Burning the bodies was actually a good thing. Burning the bodies was a good idea because the disease cant live unless the body is alive so by burning the bodies of the dead they where killing the disease. One form of plague traveled through air, and bodies had to be alive to have it. The Black Death was caused by a tiny bacterium only visible under a microscope, usually found in rats that where infected by the tiny bacterium that would bite them. The people where very dirty so they had rats everywhere, and that’s how it started. Because there is so much garbage and it is dirty it provides the rats a place to live that carry the disease and spread it even farther. These people had no natural immunity to the disease because the disease had started 15 years before their time. The effect the disease had on the peoples bodies where severe trembling, high fever, and swollen lymphomas on their neck that turned black and burst open. This was called the bubonic plague. After about 3 to 5 days with the plague the person usually died. Another deadlier plague would spread through the air and kill people in less than a day called the pneumonic plague. So many people died quickly that they sent special carts through the streets to collect the bodies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Feudal Hierarchy==
There were two social pyramids during the Middle Ages: the social pyramid and the Catholic pyramid. The social pyramid was king at the top, the nobles &amp; clergy, knights, and peasants &amp; serf. The Catholic pyramid was the Pope at the top, then cardinals, archbishops, bishops, and the common clergy.  The common clergy were nuns, priests, and monks.  The Pope was a spiritual leader and a political leader. The clergy had the most power because they controlled the 1/10 rule.  They could also excommunicate people. If the king was excommunicated then so were his subjects. Though the peasants were of the lowest rank, they had the most important jobs: growing and harvesting the crops. The knights fought for their ruler and provided land for the peasants, as did the nobles.  The king controlled everything; they had the most luxury out of everyone next to the Pope.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Can you imagine living where disease was common, and fighting was of great significance? This time was called Feudalism, the system of obligations that governed the relationships between lords and vassals in medieval Europe, was a main idea then. The following is about the Renaissance, the period of “rebirth” and creativity that followed Europe’s Middle Ages, and the Middle Ages, which is a period that lasted from about 500-1500 AD in Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is a reason the Middle Ages were referred to as the “Dark Ages.” They were not literally dark, but metaphorically dark. It was a period in time when the average commoner knew almost nothing about academia, and when lords and kings ruled over serfs and villagers with iron fists. It was a time of knights, castles, and battles; of sieges, burning, and razing.

However, there was a ray of light emanating from the East. The Arabs, in their Golden Age, during their trading with the Romans and Greeks, had kept the classics and continued studying academics. They had reproduced the writings and works of Aristotle, Plutarch, Plato, Virgil, and other notables. The Arabs formulated algebra and explored science and geometry. They also incorporated elements of Greek and Roman architecture. They were also amazingly liberal in their attitudes toward life.

The Crusades were then launched in the name of reclaiming the Holy Land, and although the Crusades primarily involved fighting, an exchange of ideas occurred. The Crusades brought these ideas home, and they planted the seeds for a revitalization of scholarly thinking and learning – the Renaissance.

In essence, the Renaissance was actually a return to the past and to lost ideas from the past. It is true, then, that he who knows his past knows his future. The Renaissance paved the way by allowing city-states and thinking to flourish, allowing for new innovations and inventions that are the foundations for today’s arts, sciences, architecture, and technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hard Consonant Assimilation==

The consonants ''с'', ''з'', ''т'', ''д'' when followed by a soft consonant are pronounced softly. Consequently, ''д'' and ''т'' change for ''дз'' and ''ц'' due to diekannie and tiekannie.

'''снег''' &quot;s'nekh&quot; snow

'''змяя́''' &quot;z'miaya&quot; a snake

'''дзве́ры''' &quot;d'very&quot; a door

'''цвёрды''' &quot;t'viordy&quot; hard

Note that (1) ''дзверы'' is a plural noun. It has no singular form; (2) in the figurative sense the word ''цяжкі'' (heavy), not ''цвёрды'' should be used, e.g.

'''ця́жкая пра́ца''' hard work

А consonant followed by the same soft consonant is also pronounced softly.

'''сне́данне''' &quot;s'niedan'nie&quot; breakfast

'''сме́цце''' &quot;s'miet'tie&quot; rubbish

'''стаго́ддзе''' &quot;staghod'die&quot; a century

The ''ддз'' combination stands for double ''дз''.

In tarashkievitsa, this assimilation is reflected in writing, i.e. such assimilated consonants are followed by a soft sign: ''сьнег'', ''зьмяя'', ''дзьверы'', ''цьвёрды'', ''сьнеданьне'', ''сьмецьце'', ''стагодзьдзе''

==Nouns ending with ок (ак)==

Nouns ending with the ''ок'' (''ак'' if unstressed) suffix loose the ''о'' (''а'') letter in plural.

'''га́нак''' a porch '''га́нкі''' porches (note that it is one of a few words where '''г''' is read '''g''', not '''h''')

'''кава́лак''' a piece '''кава́лкі''' pieces

The ''о'' (''а'') is not lost, if ''ок'' (''ак'') is not a suffix but a part of the root.

'''прыто́к''' a tributary (of a river) '''прыто́кі''' tributaries

==Verbs ending with аваць==

Verbs ending in ''аваць'' (''яваць'') change their ''ав'' (''яв'') suffix for ''у'' (''ю'') in conjugation.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Infinitive
! я
! ты
! ён (яна, яно)
! мы
! вы
! яны
! Translation
|-
| '''аваць'''
| '''ую'''
| '''уеш'''
| '''уе'''
| '''уем'''
| '''уеце'''
| '''уюць'''
|-
| '''яваць'''
| '''юю'''
| '''юеш'''
| '''юе'''
| '''юем'''
| '''юеце'''
| '''ююць'''
|-
| працава́ць
| працу́ю

| працу́еце
| працу́юць
| work
|-
| малява́ць
| малю́ю
| малю́еш
| малю́е
| малю́ем
| малю́еце
| малю́юць
| paint
|-
| вандрава́ць
| вандру́ю
| вандру́еш
| вандру́е
| вандру́ем
| вандру́еце
| вандру́юць
| travel
|}

If the ''ав'' is not a suffix, but a part of the word root, it is not lost in conjugation.

'''пла́ваць''' swim - '''пла́ваю''' I swim '''пла́ваеш''' You swim etc.

==Adverbs==

In Belarusian, adverbs are normally placed before the verb. Note that many adverbs have similar adjectives.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Adverb
! Adjective
! Translation
|-
| до́бра
| до́бры
| good
|-
| дрэ́нна
| дрэ́нны
| bad
|-
| ху́тка
| ху́ткі
| quick
|-
| мару́дна
| мару́дны
| slow
|-
| паво́льна
| паво́льны
| slow
|-
| ціка́ва
| ціка́вы
| interesting
|}

Note a differense between ''марудна'' and ''павольна''. Saying that somebody does something ''марудна'', you imply your negative attitude to it: &quot;you are doing it too slow&quot;. The word ''павольна'', conversely, would rather imply your approval, &quot;you are good not to do it too quickly&quot; -something like English ''quietly''.

==Short Answers==

In colloquial speech, when answering a special question (i.e. a question with a question word ''who'', ''what'', ''how'' etc.), it is possible to reduce your answer to a single word or phrase, corresponding to that question word.

'''Хто гэ́та? - Кот.''' (full answer: ''Гэта кот.'') &quot;Who is this?&quot; &quot;This is a cat&quot;.

'''Чый гэ́та кот? - Наш.''' (full answer: ''Гэта наш кот.'') &quot;Whose cat is this?&quot; &quot;It is ours&quot;.

'''Як пла́ваеце? - До́бра.''' (full answer: '' До́бра пла́ваю.'') &quot;How do you swim?&quot; &quot;I swim well&quot;.

A short positive answer to a general question is the principal word of the sentence (the verb or the predicate noun or adjective).

'''Mалю́еш? - Малю́ю.''' (full answer: ''Так, я малюю.'') &quot;Are you painting?&quot; &quot;Yes, I am painting.&quot;

'''Гэ́та каро́ва? - Каро́ва.''' (full answer: ''Так, гэта карова.'') &quot;Is this a cow?&quot; &quot;Yes, It is a cow.&quot;

==Exersizes==

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:Whiteknight/Nav}}

This page is going to serve as a &quot;how to edit wikibooks in a nutshell&quot; guide, that will explain some of the basics of wiki markup to get new users on their feet quickly. 

== How To Edit ==

Almost any page that you see can be edited. To edit a page, click the &quot;edit this page&quot; link at the top of the page. When you click the link, you will go to an &quot;edit screen&quot;, where you will see all the current text of the page, and you will be given the opportunity to add your own text. Once you have made your changes, click the &quot;Save this page&quot; button to save your changes. 

All changes are visible immediately, so if you want to test your changes before you save them, click the &quot;Show Preview&quot; button to see the page text before you save it.

=== Sections ===

Pages are broken into sections, separated by headlines. We will discuss headlines later, but for right now, suffice it to say that everything under a headline is part of a &quot;section&quot; of text. To edit a single section only, and not the whole page, you can click the link that says &quot;[edit]&quot; to the right of the headline. The changes that you make to a section will not affect other sections.

=== New Sections ===

Some talk pages and discussion pages have an additional &quot;+&quot; link at the top. If you click this link, you will be given the opportunity to create a new section on a page. There will be two edit boxes: a small one at the top to give the name of the section, and a large box to hold the text in the section. Once you have created both your new headline and your text, you can click either the &quot;Save page&quot; or &quot;Show Preview&quot; buttons, like usual.

== Fancy Text: Bold and Italics ==

Some of the most simple and common text formatting tools we have are bold and italics. '''Bold Text''' is bright and heavy, but also distracting. It is a good idea not to use too much bold text. ''Italics text'', on the other hand, is accented but without being distracting to the reader. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!
! How to do it
! What it looks like
|-
| Bold Text: 
| &lt;nowiki&gt;'''My text'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| '''My text'''
|-
| Italic Text:
| &lt;nowiki&gt;''My text''&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| ''My text''
|}

;Note:''Do not use too much bold or italic text!'' Too much text with fancy formatting can be distracting, and can actually make text difficult to read. Also, do not write in ALL CAPS, because it's similarly annoying.

== Headlines and Outlines ==

A headline can be created by surrounding the headline text in two equal signs, like this:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;== Headlines and Outlines ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

This code will produce the headline above. To create a sub-headline, you can use three equal signs, like this:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;=== My Subheadline ===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

For an even smaller headline, you can use 4 equals signs, or even 5. However, once you get smaller then 4 or 5, the headlines become very small and they do not stand out from the rest of the text properly. 

;Note:''Do not make your headlines bold!'' This is unnecessary and is distracting to readers. The large bold characters tend to run together and they do not look good. Also, do not make your headlines in ALL CAPS, because they are similarly distracting.

== Links ==

Because this is the internet you can create hyperlinks to other pages, to help readers navigate. Luckily, it is easy to create links in Wiki.

;Note:''You cannot use HTML-style &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; links in Wikibooks!''. Users who are familiar with HTML might find this difficult at first.

=== Wikibooks Links ===

To create a link to another page in wikibooks, you can use double square brackets, like this:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!
! How to do it
! What it looks like
|-
| Link to the page &quot;Calculus&quot;:
|&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Calculus]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| [[Calculus]]
|-
| Link to page: &quot;Preface&quot;:
| &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Preface]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| [[Preface]]
|}

If you create a link to a page that doesn't exist, the link will appear '''red'''. Links to pages that do exist will be '''blue'''. Links are all spelling sensitive, and also case sensitive. This means that  &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Calculus]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is not the same as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[CaLCulUS]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. If you have a red link that you think should be blue, double check the spelling and capitalization of the page name.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Renaissance left behind a lasting impact on history. The Renaissance began to uncover classical human achievements and the arts, and trade blossomed. New ways of thinking became common and architecture spread, making Greek and Roman styles more common. The idea of individualism, or humanism, was developed, and stress was placed on human actions and importance. New ideas were thought of, and new artwork emerged. The Church’s stranglehold on Europe loosened as the Reformation occurred and humanism spread. There was a spirit of excitement and joy and Europe was looking to the future. The Renaissance encouraged growth, learning, and expansion. It revitalized Europe and reinvigorated it, paving the way for the Age of Exploration. The Renaissance and Exploration Ages reestablished the ancient ideas and founded the pillars on which modern civilization stands. The values and spirit of the Renaissance are to this day instilled on our lives.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Johannes Geasfleisch zur Lam zum Gutenberg was born sometime in 1400, and he was the youngest child in his family. His father was an upper class clothe merchant. His mother was his father’s second wife and the daughter of a shopkeeper. Growing up Gutenberg like to learn about mechanics. Before he made the moveable printing press, he was a gold merchant, and build machines.
The printing press began in 1444,  but was not finished until 1452. Then people did not hear about it until three years later, when Gutenberg published the bible in Latin in 1456, the first printed book. Eventually it became increasingly popular and it was in high demand. Gutenberg then began printing bibles in other languages, so people could learn to read. This led to the advancement of reading.
Johannes Gutenberg was very important to the Renaissance and Literature. Gutenberg was a German who developed the printing press using movable type. Instead of Monks having to write out every word in every book, the printing press could create whole pages at once! Since more books could be made, there was spread of ideas.  This spread of ideas increased the concept of learning, and lessened the power of the Catholic Church. 
Before the Renaissance and Reformation the only literature that people had was the Bible. The “re-birth” caused Protestants and humanists to create pieces of writing stating their ideas. Literature was affected by Johannes Gutenberg inventing the printing press. It enabled people to create multiple copies of writings in different languages. The humanists and Protestants were able to spread their ideas all over the world. One of these humanists was William Shakespeare, known as the greatest English writer today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before the Renaissance and Reformation the only literature that people had was the Bible. The “re-birth” caused Protestants and humanists to create pieces of writing stating their ideas. Literature was affected by Johannes Gutenberg who invented the printing press. IT enabled people to create multiple copies of writings in different languages. The humanists and Protestants were able to spread their ideas all over the world. One of these humanists was William Shakespeare, known as the greatest English writer today. 

==William Shakespeare: 1564-1616==
William Shakespeare was an important figure in literature. He was an English poet, playwright, and an actor. He wrote 38 plays and 154 sonnets. A sonnet has 14 lines, a structured rhyme and a logical structure. He attended King Edward VI Grammer School. He married Anne Hathaway at age 18. Shakespeare was a great playwright who created comedies, tragedies, and histories. A history is when Shakespeare make a powerful person who he thought had many faults look good, but made his opinions known on a different person. A comedy of his was “A Midsummers Night Dream”, and a tragedy was “Hamlet”. He also wrote poems, like “Venus and Adonis”. All of his literature contributed to humanism because he introduced ideas that the Middle Ages didn’t cover. Shakespeare talked about themes that are always going to be a problem. For example, he talked about forbidden love, death, war, etc. That’s a lot about Shakespeare.

==Machiavelli: 1469-1521==
Niccoló di Bernardo dei Machiavelli was also very important to the advancement of literature. Born in a small town near Florence, Machiavelli was an Italian political philosopher, musician, poet, and romantic comedic playwright. He wrote many books, but one of his most famous books is The Prince. It describes how a prince can retain control of his realm. In this book, he focuses on the new prince, not the one born into royalty. That is because a new prince has to “stabilize his newfound power”. His main interests were politics, military theory, and history. He had a realist political theory. His influences were Cicero, Sallust, Livy, and Xenophon. He also influenced Thomas Hobbes, and James Harrington. Some of his other works are Discorso sopra le Cose di Pisa, Decennale Secondo, Clizia, and Frammenti Storici.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Creation of the Anglican Church (Church of England)==
When the Catholic Church did not allow King Henry VIII to divorce, King Henry decided to make his own church called, The Anglican Church, or more commonly known as, Church of England. Because King Henry only wanted a divorce, the Anglican Church follows many of the same religious practices as the Catholic Church.

==King Henry VIII==

===Life===
King Henry VIII was King of England and lived 1491 – 1547.
He had an older brother, Arthur, the Prince of Wales, who had passed away leaving Henry to the throne.

He was infamous for having six wives with two divorced, two beheaded, one dead. His last wife, however, survived long after King Henry died. His six wives were:
#Catherine of Aragon (Divorced)
#Anne Boleyn (Beheaded)
#Jane Seymour (Died)
#Anne of Cleves (Divorced)
#Catherine Howard (Beheaded)
#Katherine Parr (survived)


He also severed the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church, because when he wanted a divorce, and the church would not let him. This was also part of the protestant reformation.


*In addition, the first wife of King Henry bore a daughter named Mary I who was later known as 'Bloody Mary' after she was taken to the throne after Edward VI who died shortly after birth.

Later in life, Henry VIII was declared as 'insane' due to his actions.

===Works===
King Henry wasn’t famous only for his six wives, but his true works of songs, speeches, letters, and poems. His poems talked about love, dreams, feelings, etc. Some of his well-known poems and song are:

&lt;pre&gt;
(Song)

[Green groweth the holly]          

Green groweth the holly, so doth the ivy.
Though winter blasts blow never so high,
Green groweth the holly.

As the holly groweth green 
    And never changeth hue,
So I am, and ever hath been,
    Unto my lady true.
            Green groweth  .  .  .  etc.

As the holly groweth green,
    With ivy all alone,
When flowerys cannot be seen
    And green-wood leaves be gone,
              ut supra

Now unto my lady
    Promise to her I make:
From all other only
    To her I me betake.
              ut supra

Adieu, mine own lady,
    Adieu, my specïal,
Who hath my heart truly,
    Be sure, and ever shall.

Green groweth the holly, so doth the ivy.
Though winter blasts blow never so high,
Green groweth the holly. 


Pastime with good company

    Pastime with good company
    I love and shall until I die.
    Grudge who likes, but none deny,
    So God be pleased, thus live will I.
    For my pastance:
    Hunt, sing, and dance.
    My heart is set!
    All goodly sport
    For my comfort.
    Who shall me let?

    Youth must have some dalliance,
    Of good or ill some pastance.
    Company I think then best --
    All thoughts and fantasies to digest.
    For idleness
    Is chief mistress
    Of vices all.
    Then who can say
    But mirth and play
    Is best of all?

    Company with honesty
    Is virtue -- vices to flee.
    Company is good and ill,
    But every man has his free will.
    The best ensue.
    The worst eschew.
    My mind shall be.
    Virtue to use.
    Vice to refuse.
    Thus shall I use me!
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">By the late Renaissance, many people had many complaints against the Catholic Churches. That was the first move that led to the Reformation. Reformation, being the reforming movement against the Roman Catholic Church.  Most of the complaints were about the way the church served people. Some thought the popes and bishops weren’t religious anymore and too involved in politics rather than actually doing their job. Many thought the church was getting rich unfairly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Martin Luther (was originally named Martin Luder) was born on November 10, 1483 in Eislenburg, Germany. He worked as a monk, teacher and a reformer. Luther’s father, Hans Luther, was determined to make his son a lawyer so he sent Luther to a school in Mansfeld. In 1498, he went to University of Erfurt to study law. During his time at the University, there was a lightning storm which made him decide that he should become a monk.

Despite his family’s and friend’s efforts to persuade Luther not to, Luther entered the Augustinian monastery in Erfurt in 1505. There, he studied the life of a monk: to fast, pray and work. He woke up at three in the morning and prayed. 
A monk’s life was hard. They were only given one meal a day in the winter and two in the summer. They were not allowed to talk during meals. They donated to people, made clothes, prayed, took care of sick people, provided shelter and helped people in times of need. 

Martin Luther first became a reformer when he believed that the Church was doing things wrong. The Church was making people pay money for their sins to be forgiven (indulgences), the Pope was too involved in politics, and the Church had too much money. To protest against these doings, he found followers and made his own, the Lutherans. Luther’s idea spread quickly throughout Germany with the print press.

==Indulgences==
Indulgences were documents given by the pope that excuses people from the sins that he or she had committed. It was like buying your way into heaven. Also indulgences could be used to reduce the time he or she spends in purgatory. Martin Luther wanted to change how the church was handling the sins of other people. So Martin Luther wrote the 95 theses. The 95 theses were the 95 complaints of the Catholic Church. At first no one followed him but then many people started to follow him. These people that followed him were called Lutherans. Martin at first didn’t want to form a new church, but ended up making the Lutheran Church.

==The 95 Theses==
With the idea of protesting against the Catholic Church, Luther made his list of complaints or things he didn’t like about the church known as the 95 Theses. 

Exsurge Domine is a papal bull by Pope Leo X to the opposition of the 95 Theses. The Exsurge Domine stated asked that 41 would be removed from the Theses. Pope Leo X gave Luther sixty days to remove 41. When Luther did not remove them by the time the 60 days were over, Pope Leo X excommunicated him on January 3, 1521.

      <comment>/* Renaissance Art */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Renaissance art was so much more different then they were in the past. During the Renaissance, Italian artists created the most beautiful paintings and sculptures. Artists showed people in the most realistic ways. Artists would study the human bodies and drew almost exactly what they saw. They used a new technique called perspective, a way of showing depth and distance on a flat surface. They made closer people darker in color, and people farther away less colorful and in depth and farther away. They use ordinary lines and make them look like an illusion and this makes the painting more realistic. Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel, the muscular human figures in the painting, and reminds the viewer of Greek and Roman statues. The Ancient ruins and statues inspired painters and Architects.

==Humanism==
Humanism is a way of thinking and learning that stresses the importance of human abilities and action. Humanism started in Florence and spread in Italy and then it spread North through Europe. Some of the humanistic subjects are poetry, history, art, and Greek/Latin languages. Humanism also led to rediscovering of ancient writing. Art changed too, the middle ages the subject of art was more religious; things like angles, the apostles and god. But after in the Renaissance the artist started drawing more realistic things, like everyday people and things. In the Renaissance people Looked up to science more than they looked up to the church for answers. That means that people relied less on the kings and the pope got weaker because the people could fix their own problems.  People also could create thing like microscope, telescope, and printing press.

==Renaissance Art==
The Renaissance people wanted art that showed joy in human beauty and life’s pleasures. Renaissance art is more lifelike than in the art of the Middle Ages, which focused on religion. Renaissance artists studied perspective or the differences in the way things look when they are close to something or far away. The artists painted in a way that showed these differences. As a result, their paintings seem to have depth.

One of the most popular major achievements was the Mona Lisa, by Leonardo Da Vinci. Leonardo was believed to be a great man. He was extraordinarily smart and a fantastic thinker. He was an Italian scientist, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, painter, sculptor, architect, musician and writer. He created a tank, a flying machine, a parachute, and most importantly his art. He created the Mona Lisa, which is widely considered his greatest work. He also produced paintings in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican City. 

Another great artist, Michelangelo Buonarroti, regarded himself as a sculptor. He created the famous David.  He created tombs for the Medici family and Julius II. This proved the masterful skill Michelangelo had. 

In the Renaissance there were many great artists like one from Florence, Giotto, who was one of the first to paint in this new style of perspective 3D art and vanishing point. Giotto lived more than a century before the beginning of the Renaissance, but his paintings show real emotion. The bodies look solid, and the background of his paintings shows perspective. The art produced during the Renaissance would build upon Giotto’s style.

Renaissance art was very similar to art made in Rome and Greece about 1200-2000 years ago. People began carving out sculptures of men and woman like in the past. People began using the new art on the gardens, houses and castles as well. In Renaissance people didn’t paint gods and devils, they started to focus on humanism-The study of history, literature, public speaking and art that lead to a new way of thinking In Europe in 1300s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some Renaissance scientists thought mathematics could help them understand the universe. Scientists read Ancient texts and expanded on the ideas they found. They made new symbols like the square root symbol, the addition symbol, and the subtraction symbol. Advanced mathematics led to advances in other fields of science. Engineers and Architects used new mathematical formulas to strengthen buildings. Other scientists wanted to know about the heavens, and what was beyond the confines of the Earth. They studied astronomy to learn about the sun, stars, and planets. While studying the heavens, they learned that the earth revolves around the sun. All of these new ideas led to the making of a more accurate calendar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Architecture was a very important subject of the Middle Ages. Architecture first changed from a gothic styling to a warmer appearance in Florence, Italy during the early 15th century. Although architecture quickly spread to Germany, England and Russia, it didn’t spread to France until 125 years later. Architecture of the Renaissance particularly placed emphasis on symmetry, geometry and proportion. It was during this time that architects began using more bricks and the color red became much more popular. Another thing that became popular were large windows because they allowed illumination to enter dark rooms, providing a warmer experience. The Dome was a very common design in Renaissance architecture. Almost all cathedrals had domes that held paintings on their ceilings. Some important architects that became popular for their designs were Leonardo da Vinci, Filippo Brunelleschi and Michelangelo Buonarroti. 

==Renaissance Homes==	
The architectural elements of Renaissance homes were different from the ones of the Middle Ages. The homes owned by wealthy people reflected elements of ancient Roman architecture. Architects built homes that surrounded astounding courtyards. The facades of buildings had simple, symmetrical decorations on them. Architects designed most homes with large windows, which illuminated rooms. Homes were made of stone, which was carved or painted with gorgeous details. Stained glass was no longer used in this time period because it was dark and was not comforting. The fine houses of the renaissance had statues with gods and goddesses. Demons and angels were no longer used to decorate. The homes were surrounded by well-tamed gardens that had flowers and shrubs placed in geometric patterns. The homes were brighter and had a more comforting feel to them. This architecture was less gothic and more peaceful and graceful then the architectural style of the Middle Ages.	

==Churches==
[[Image:Venice - Miracoli's Church 03.jpg|100px|]]
Churches in medieval times had a gothic style. They were heavily adorned with figures of angels, demons and saints. Architects began to create warmer, brighter churches. The use of stained glass was lessened, letting more light come into the building. Domes and arches became very common.

One example of a famous renaissance church is the Sistine Chapel.  It is a small chapel in the Vatican. Built during the reign of Poe Sixtus IV Della Rovere (1475-1483) the chapel stands at 40.93 meters long, 13.41 meters wide and 20.7 meters high. The ceiling was originally painted with gold stars against a blue background. Michelangelo repainted it to make it more religious. He created scenes, which depicted the history of the universe, G-d and humanity.

Built in 1296, the Duomo is an architectural masterpiece of Florence. Building of the Duomo took 200 years to complete. It is a symbol of Florence and the renaissance. All streets in Florence eventually lead to the Duomo. It is famous for its bronze doors called the Doors of Paradise, built by Ghiberti. It has a pink, white, and green façade. The Duomo has an octagonal dome that is 42 meters in span and consists of two layers. The size of the Duomo shows the importance of Catholicism to the city.
The St. Peters Basillia is a very famous church. Michelangelo designed it. The Grand façade is 116 meters wide and 53 meters wide and has 13 statues. The central balcony is called the Loggia of the blessings. Antonio Averulino designed the door in the center. The Northernmost door is called The Holy Door, built by Vico Consort.

==Effects of Renaissance Architecture==
Today we use many techniques and ideas from the renaissance architecture. Learning about architecture has helped teach new mathematical concepts, as well as a greater understanding of the arts. For example, the White House uses arches, columns and domes, similar to structures during the renaissance.  Also, the Church paid people money to make the new religious structures. This means that skilled laborers became more common, allowing more people to become wealthy, and eventually forming a middle class.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To begin programming in Python, you'll first need to install it.

== Windows and Mac OS X ==
Go to [http://python.org/download python.org] and download the windows/mac installer.

== Linux/Unix ==
Your distribution should come prepackaged with Python, type &lt;tt&gt;which python&lt;/tt&gt; at the terminal make sure you have it.  If nothing comes up, check your distribution's documentation or go to [http://python.org/download Python.org] and build the package from source.

If you have any trouble, remember there are plenty of places you can go for [[Where to go for Help|help]].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">*What is interactive mode?
*Why is it useful?

== Running Python in Interactive Mode ==
1. Open a terminal (command line) window
:* '''Windows:''' Go to &quot;Start&quot; -&gt; &quot;Run&quot; -&gt; &quot;cmd&quot;
:* '''Linux:''' See your documentation.
:* '''Mac OS X:''' Go to the Applications/Utilities folder and double click &quot;Terminal&quot;.

2. Type &quot;python&quot; and hit ''Return''.

If you see something like:

 Python 2.3.4 (#2, Aug 29 2004, 02:04:10) 
 [GCC 3.3.4 (Debian 1:3.3.4-9)] on linux2
 Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
 &gt;&gt;&gt;

Congratulations, you've got Python working on your system!

If not, python probably isn't [[Python Programming/Installing Python|installed]] properly.

== Using Interactive Mode ==
*What does interactive mode look like?

When you start Python in interactive mode, it will start by showing:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
This is Python's way of telling you that you are in interactive mode.  In interactive mode, you can type Python commands and see the results once you hit ''Return''.  To quit interactive mode, type ''Ctrl'' + ''D''.

To try out interactive mode, at the &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; prompt, type the following, and then hit ''Return'':
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
 print &quot;We are the knights who say Ni!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Congratulations, you've just made your first Python program!</text>

*What are Python scripts?

== Prerequisites ==

Making and Changing Directories:
:* All: [[w:chdir|cd]]
:* OS X, Linux: [[w:mkdir|mkdir]]
:* Windows: [[w:List_of_DOS_commands#md_or_mkdir|md]]

Opening Terminal/Commandline Windows:
:*[[Python: Interactive Mode]]

== Running Python in Script Mode ==
1. Find your text editor
:* '''Windows:''' &quot;Start&quot; -&gt; &quot;Accessories&quot; -&gt; &quot;Notepad&quot;
:* '''Mac OS X:''' Open TextEdit, then go to the menubar and click &quot;Format&quot; -&gt; &quot;Make Plain Text&quot;
:* '''Linux:''' Run &quot;gedit&quot;, &quot;kedit&quot;, &quot;mousepad&quot;, &quot;nano&quot;, &quot;vim&quot;, &quot;emacs&quot;, or the like.

2. In your text editor, type the following (don't just copy and paste, that's lazy, typing reinforces the learning):
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/python
 
print &quot;We are the knights who say, Ni!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

3. Save the file as &quot;hello.py&quot;, under some obvious directory that you won't mind saving a lot of python files in.

4. Now, run it:
:* Open up your command line/terminal again, change to the directory where you just saved your python file, and type:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
python hello.py
&lt;/source&gt;

5. Viola!  Python printed &quot;We are the knights who say, Ni!&quot; to your screen!  You now know how to create and execute python scripts.

=== Exercises ===

*Modify the &lt;tt&gt;hello.py&lt;/tt&gt; program to say hello to a historical political leader (or to [[w:Ada Lovelace|Ada Lovelace]]).
*Change the program so that after the greeting, it demands, &quot;You must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest with....  A HERRING!&quot;.

[[Python Programming/Creating Python programs/Solutions|Solutions]]

== Running Scripts in Interactive Mode ==
If you want to run scripts in interactive mode, you can start python with &quot;-i&quot;.  This can be '''very''' useful for debugging and prototyping:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
python -i hello.py

===Key Figure===

Aaron Beck was born July 18, 1921 in Providence, Rhode Island, United States, to Russian Jewish immigrants.  Beck’s birth, as the youngest of five children, was into a family marked by tragedy; a brother had already died in infancy as had a sister during the influenza pandemic in 1919.  One consequence of these events was that Beck’s mother was severely depressed for periods of Beck’s childhood, providing him with his first exposure to a principal focus of his future career.  Beck viewed himself as a replacement child, effectively easing his mother’s sense of loss.  It seems fitting that Beck’s arrival apparently served as at least a partial cure for his mother’s depression, setting him on his life’s work at a very early age. 

A childhood accident in which Beck’s arm was broken and became infected represents another important episode from which we can trace Beck’s later interest in and understanding of psychopathology.  Beck’s condition had been serious and his recovery in hospital was long and arduous; he developed a number of phobias and anxieties as a result and his extended absence from school led him to believe he was stupid and inept (beliefs compounded by a harsh grade one teacher who held him back).  But through self-help and hard work Beck eventually overtook his age-matched peers.  Weishaar (1993) quotes Beck as recalling of his ‘comeback’, “psychologically it did show some evidence that I could do things, that if I got into a hole I could dig myself out” (p. 10).  His school success over the next few years illustrated for the young Beck the power of disconfirming evidence in the face of negative thoughts and beliefs about oneself, a realization that became a corner stone of his later therapy model.  As well, Beck considered the anger of this teacher and his mother’s mood swings to have been instrumental in developing his pronounced sensitivity to changes in others’ moods, a skill that his students and colleagues observed many years later to be a key feature of Beck’s therapy work (although somewhat less evident in his therapy writings).   

It wasn’t until conversations many years later with David Barlow (the renowned behavior therapist and anxiety specialist) and his 1985 adaptation of his therapy model for anxiety disorders and phobias that Beck fully understood the phobias (of abandonment, of blood, and of surgery) he developed following his childhood accident and convalescence.  Indeed, he wrestled with these for years, attributing his entry into medicine as partly an attempt to defeat them, and using his internship experiences on rotations in surgery and internal medicine to disconfirm the beliefs that underscored these phobias.  Beck drew on his first-hand experience with phobias and anxiety, and also his bouts of mild depression (funding limitations and the loss of an office on campus marked a difficult period for him in the mid-1960s) as valuable experiences from which he gained insight as he wrote his books on the causes and treatment of there disorders (the first of which was published in 1967).  

Beck graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Brown University in 1942 and completed his M.D. at Yale in 1946.  Although initially interested in psychiatry, Beck could not embrace the Kraeplinian approach to psychiatry, which he found to be nihilistic.  Nor was he wholly comfortable with what he considered to be the soft and esoteric approach of the Psychoanalytic School of Psychotherapy.  His initial rejection of the latter reveals another key characteristic of Beck that set the stage for his venture toward an innovative theory of psychopathology and psychotherapy of his own.  Weishaar (1993) quotes him as recalling, “It [psychoanalysis] was nonsense.  I could not see that it really fitted.  I always had a kind of rebellious thing… [but] this was probably the first time I was aware of it” (p. 14).  His evidence-based training in internal medicine led him instead to pursue neurology with its precision and empiricism but a required rotation back in psychiatry meant his struggles with psychoanalytic thought and therapy were only really just beginning.  However, he remained in psychiatry after the required six months, slowly ‘seduced’ by the manner in which psychoanalysts had interpretations and explanations for everything and by the promise of psychoanalysis as a cure for most conditions.  Beck was even supervised by Erik Erickson, the renowned German psychoanalyst, during his two-year fellowship in psychiatry at the Austin Riggs Center in Massachusetts.  

Beck was board certified in psychiatry in 1953 and began teaching in psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School in 1954.  After finishing his analytic training at the Philadelphia Psychoanalytic Institute he took a post as an assistant professor of psychiatry at Penn in 1959.  At that point he set about researching the empirical basis of psychoanalytic theory, with the objective of convincing ‘hard-headed psychologists’, who Beck recognized as influential but rejecting of psychoanalysis, of its scientific validity.  Beck focused on the dreams of depressed patients because he believed that the psychoanalytic theories of depression were both well-developed and testable (and he had a readily available depressed population with which to work).  However, using procedures from experimental psychology (learnt from colleagues in psychology such as Seymour Feshbach), the collective evidence from these studies (which was quite the contrary to the retroflected hostility, need to suffer, and seeking of failure predicted by psychoanalytic theory), led Beck to view depressed patients instead as holding distorted views of themselves and reality.  His research results matched his experiences with patients in therapy.  Beck has pointed to the lack of empirical support as the reason for his moving away from the motivational basis and associated structures of psychoanalytic thinking.  But according to his collaborator, Ruth Greenberg, his personality, particularly the aforementioned rebelliousness, would have undermined his ability to remain within the psychoanalytic fold for very long (Weishaar, 1993).  Beck erred towards his own data rather than the psychoanalytic authorities of his day.  Beck also liked to be in control, Greenberg recalled, something that he would have lacked while undergoing analysis himself; it is likely no coincidence that his Cognitive Therapy explicitly involves the patient in a collaboration with the therapist and makes the patient their own authority.                           

As he developed Cognitive Therapy, Beck drew on the work of psychologists (such as George Kelly and Jean Piaget in his initial formulations), finding support in the advances made with the emergence of cognitive psychology in the 1970s (including the work of individuals such as Albert Bandura), and later corresponding with fellow cognitively oriented theorists and therapists including Albert Ellis and Donald Meichenbaum.  But what is interesting about his break with psychoanalytic thought and therapy is just how quickly and comprehensively he formulated his alternative model of psychopathology and therapy.  As he recollects, “Within a couple of years, I really laid the framework for everything that’s happened since then.  There’s nothing that I’ve been associated with since 1963 the seeds of which were not in the 1962 to 1964 articles” (Weishaar, 1993, p. 21).  
In coming up with Cognitive Therapy, Beck described the process as having involved, first, observing his patients and developing ways to measure his observations; second, advancing a theory to explain these observations; third, devising interventions to address them; and, fourth, designing research to confirm or disconfirm the whole enterprise.  The development and use of measures in psychotherapy (among which the most well known are the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Scale for Suicide Ideation) represents one area in which Beck’s pioneering efforts made a huge and influential contribution to the field more broadly.  A second area in which Beck’s contribution is clear is in evaluation research work.  From the beginning, Beck emphasized the importance of empirical evaluations of therapy, with the first study of his own Cognitive Therapy published in 1977 by Beck’s close collaborator, Shaw, and a recent review of 16 meta-analyses by Beck and his colleagues appearing in 2006.  A third area representing another of his major contributions is reflected in Beck’s publication in 1979 of what was, essentially, a therapist’s ‘how-to’ guide to the treatment of depression.  This book was based on the early training manual and its revisions that Beck had used as he recruited and trained his team of psychiatrists and psychologists in his clinical and research endeavors.  The manualization of treatment approaches has greatly facilitated the training of psychotherapists and, since Beck’s initial efforts, has become a mainstay of treatment program evaluation research today (Woody &amp; Sanderson, 1998), affording researchers a means to introduce and monitor treatment integrity and fidelity and so discern what differences truly exist between models and approaches under scrutiny.    

It should be noted, however, that Beck’s ideas and therapy weren’t the only developments that undermined the dominance of psychoanalytic thought in psychiatry.  Biological models of psychopathology and pharmacological treatments were (re-)emerging in the 1960s too.  Indeed, it is interesting to note that the two articles Beck published in 1963 and 1964 in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry (articles in which he first set out his theory of depression, his clinical observations and evidence in support of it, and its application to psychotherapy), appeared alongside numerous articles about the biological basis and assessment of depression (e.g., Gibbons, 1964; Kurland, 1964; Wechsler et al., 1963).  Of course, Beck wasn’t alone in his desire to better understanding and treating depression but he was quite distinct from others, in that he was putting forward his ideas about the role of cognition (combining the patient’s internal experience, specifically their accessible thoughts and feelings rather than the subconscious motivations emphasized by psychoanalytic thought, with an emphasis on empiricism borrowed from behavior therapy) at a time when North American psychiatry was quite distracted by a paradigm shift that was already underway.  Unlike Beck, his fellow ‘radicals’ in psychiatry (and their articles book-ending Beck’s in the 1960s) were struggling to give nature a place back at the table, turning from phenomenology to biological models and pharmacological treatments.  It is of interest that these efforts eventually ushered in the renaissance of biological psychiatry in the 1970s (Shorter, 1997), with Beck’s work appearing conspicuously more at home in the context of the cognitive revolution in psychology, which also was taking place in that period.   

It seems fitting to end this selective consideration of Beck’s biography and contributions as we started, by looking back at Beck’s family.  Beck faced considerable resistance to his ideas throughout his career from the psychoanalytic and behavioral schools.  Despite this resistance, and his own history of various phobias and depression, Beck was evidently a strong and determined individual, able to work for many years in relative isolation (although his preference has clearly been for collaborative efforts (see, for example, some of his key publications).  It is in Beck’s parents that the source of these characteristics can be clearly seen.  Turning first to Beck’s mother, Lizzie Temkin, we can see the same determination and autonomy that her youngest son showed later.  The premature death of Beck’s grandmother meant Lizzie, as the oldest of nine, had to assume much of the responsibility of caring for the family, and she maintained her role as matriarch throughout her life.  Although three of her brothers graduated from universities, her own aspiration to be a physician went unfulfilled.  But her dominant and outspoken manner must have been an inspiration of sorts to Beck in later life as he persevered to develop and disseminate his research and psychotherapy.  

In Beck’s father too, Harry Beck, a printer by trade, we can see the foundations of some of Beck’s characteristics.  Harry was not nearly religious enough to endear himself to Lizzie’s father when their marriage was announced.  This was, in part, due to Harry’s active involvement in the socialist movement (having been an anti-Bolshevik in his native Russia).  Harry was also something of an intellectual in their Rhode Island community, serving as a regular host of meetings in which politics, philosophy, and literature were discussed, and later taking courses in literature and psychology at his son’s future alta mater, Brown University.  All his sons inherited their father’s intellectual curiosity; Beck is known to have wide and eclectic reading interests.  As well, it is interesting to note that just as his father regularly sought feedback on his poetry from his sons, Beck went on to regularly seek feedback on his ideas and manuscripts from his colleagues and students.  Most notably in the context of these comments is the fact that Harry was a free-thinker, not merely someone who unquestioningly went along with prevailing wisdom and practice, just as his youngest son proved to be years later as a pioneer in the psychotherapy field.          

Brief mention must also be made both of Beck’s prolific output (he has published over 500 articles and authored or co-authored 17 books, as reported on the website for the Beck Institute for Cognitive Therapy and Research), and also the plethora of major awards Beck has received over his lifetime (41 are noted on the Beck Institute website).  These serve as testament to the considerable importance of his work.  Of particular note are the awards he received from the American Psychological Association, in 1989, and from the American Psychiatric Association, in 2006, but also earlier and perhaps of greater historical interest, in 1979, at a time when the American Psychoanalytic School were strongly resisting the purging of its influence in the DSM (see Bayer &amp; Spitzer, 1985) and whose adherents would not have been welcoming of any recognition of Cognitive Therapy.  Indeed, Beck is the only individual to have been honored by both Associations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Gothic}} __NOTOC__
The Gothic Language will require some things to be installed in order for you to learn it and use it on a computer - a Gothic and Futhark font, and a Gothic and Futhark keymap. We will not be using the standard Latin alphabet for this book, so it is necessary that you get it working. When you have finished installing the fonts, the Gothic alphabet and the Futhark alphabet should appear in the boxes below.  You will know if it hasn't worked because it will look like black squares or question marks.

=== Getting a Proper Font ===
==== Gothic Font ====
There are several fonts that you can use for Gothic, and there are basically three different styles of font - [http://robert-pfeffer.spacequadrat.de/Schriftarten Skeirs], [http://robert-pfeffer.spacequadrat.de/Schriftarten Ulfilas] and [http://www.keidan.it/typo/fonts/vulc/index.html], and [http://code2000.net/CODE2001.ZIP Code2001] - sans-serif, serif, and a scribe-ish handwritten style. 

For a beginner in Gothic it might be better to use Skeirs as the font of choice because it is very easy to read in comparison to the serif font. However, you might prefer the serif font, and if you use Code2001 or Skeirs, you can use the already included Futhark characters rather than download an extra font. Code2001 is also one of the few Gothic Fonts which actually represents the tremad (double-dotted) eis character, which is not included in Skeirs. If you can memorize stress of words correctly (which you MUST do regardless of whether you have that character represented with two diphthongs or not), it shouldn't be too much of a problem. This letter isn't even represented in the Windows Gothic keymap and doesn't appear in the [http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U10330.pdf Unicode 5 Standard PDF Chart] detailing the Gothic range of characters.

Issues with Vulcanius and Ulfilas are covered in the next section although they do not actually have Futhark codes.

==== Futhark Font ====
Both Skeirs and Code2001 support the Elder Futhark alphabet. Generally Elder Futhark letters stay relatively the same and won't be too big an issue. However, Skeirs has the alternative SkiersGR font which has larger runes making for easier reading than Code2001, which will display the standard small, thin runes which might be hard to look at. On the flip side these larger runes won't center properly. Skeirs and Ulfilas encode Gothic characters in the Latin range of characters, so it might also make some sites with both Gothic and English content, particularly the Gothic Wikipedia, look unreadable. Vulcanius does not have this problem, but it might not render some web pages properly under certain browsers, and does not share the easy reading of Skeirs or even Code2001. Some of the other [http://fontsy.com/theme_24.html free Gothic fonts] available could be elsewhere on the web.

=== Getting the Font to work ===
'''Note for Windows 95, 98 and ME users:''' Windows 9x does not have Unicode support by default and you will have to install [http://www.i18nguy.com/surrogates.html Supplimentary character support according to these directions].

'''Note for Internet Explorer users:''' Internet Explorer will not render Gothic on the web unless you select the specific font to use. If you have not registered an account for here, register and click [[Special:Mypage/monobook.css|here]]. In the text box insert this:
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
body {
    font-family: Skeirs, Code2001, sans-serif;
}
&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;
This will make the site look a little unclean, but you should be able to use the tutorial now at least for the Gothic fonts. This problem is not relevant for users of Opera, or Gecko based browsers like Seamonkey or Firefox. Users that have a KHTML browser like Safari or Konqueror please test to see if Unicode problems with Gothic occur.

==== Windows Users ====
# Decompress the fonts that you downloaded into a directory.
# Go to the control panel and click on the fonts icon
# Click on the file menu and then click the option &quot;Install new font&quot;
# Go to where you unzipped the fonts
# Select all of the font files that appear
# Click &quot;Install fonts&quot;
# Restart your browser

==== Mac OS X Users ====
# Decompress the fonts and drag them into the fonts directory
# Restart your browser

==== Linux Users ====
'''Note:''' This assumes you are on KDE, XFCE, or GNOME where you probably do not know how to install a font. If you are not on these window managers please read the manual for your corresponding Linux distribution.
# Decompress the fonts you downloaded into a directory.
# Open up a window in the file manager and type &quot;font://&quot;
# Drag the fonts into this directory
# Restart your browser

=== Installing a Keymap ===
If you are wanting to install a keymap as well, in order to type easily in Gothic, there are few options out there.
* Windows users can use [http://www.babelstone.co.uk/Keyboards/Gothic.html the Babelstone Keyboard layout] (Note: The instructions are dated).
* OS X users can use [http://www.keidan.it/typo/kb/gkb/gkb.html Keidan's Gothic Keyboard Layout].
* Linux users not capable of writing their own keymap are stuck with [http://marnanel.org/gothic a simple Javascript &quot;transliterator&quot;] for all writing in Gothic. There are keymap creators but documentation is scarce and many desktop environments don't seem to be centered around translations. For this reason, you can stick with using the Icelandic keymap, which should give you all the characters you need.

You've probably completed our tutorial on the Gothic language by now, so you might want to do some further reading.
=== Learn More ===
==== Joseph J. Wright's ''Grammar of the Gothic Language'' ====
This book was used as a basis for this tutorial in combination with David Salo's tutorials. The book has absolutely everything you need to know about Gothic to speak it with the exception of the neologisms, which were taken from ''Gotische Grammatik'' and conventions used by the Gothic Wikipedia for the formation of new words.

The third edition is public domain, so feel free to download it from either source. 
* ''[http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~kurisuto/germanic/goth_wright_about.html Grammar of the Gothic Language]'' - From the Germanic Lexicon Project individual OCR scans of each text.
* ''[http://www.deadlanguages.us.to/germanic/index.shtml Grammar of the Gothic Language]'' - Preassembled PDF of the above

==== David Salo's ''Basic Gothic Tutorial'' ====
David's tutorial was used as a partial basis for this tutorial. AS it is limited by the technology of its time, the tutorial will not present you with anything new, and it's not even a complete tutorial. Nevertheless, it might be a good resource for learning the Latin transcription of Gothic if you just want to use the standard US keymap. This would be preferable for Linux users, even if they might be able to get away with using the Icelandic keymap.

=== Sharpen your skills ===
You can sharpen your Gothic skills by visiting these sites, and either reading or contributing to them. They will increase your ability to read and write Gothic, and you will learn more about the people behind the language. The Wikis will give you the hardest challenge - writing, especially for Uncyclopedia, where you must build humour with the language - which can be exceptionally hard!

=== Chapter 2 Goals ===
In Chapter 2 you will learn:
# The difference between the strong and weak verb or noun
# The different stems in gothic and how to use them.
# The different cases in how to write things in Gothic and how to use them.
# How to change words from case to case.
# The differences in Gender.
# The several Gothic pronouns and when to use them.
# Several words, which will be in one case, but you will have to use them in other cases. The genders will be mixed, so you will have to memorize how to conjugate (change) each verb (word describing action), and such.
Chapter 2 will probably the most complex and difficult chapter that you will go through. After this chapter, everything else should be pretty much smooth sailing.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Random Number Generation ===

{{Exercises|1=
# Roll two dice! With &lt;code&gt;sumTwoDice&lt;/code&gt; that is :-) . Use &lt;code&gt;fst&lt;/code&gt; to extract the result.
# Write a function &lt;code&gt;rollNDice :: Int -&gt; Seed -&gt; ([Int],Seed)&lt;/code&gt; that rolls dice n times and returns a list of the n results. ''Extra:'' If you know about infinite lists, use &lt;code&gt;unfoldr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;take&lt;/code&gt; to get the result list (but without seed this time).
# Reimplement &lt;code&gt;Seed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rollDie&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;StdGen&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;random&lt;/code&gt; from {{Haskell lib|p=random|v=1.0.0.0|System|Random}}.
# Now that you have random numbers, do some statistical experiments with the help of &lt;code&gt;rollNDice&lt;/code&gt;. For example, do a sanity check that &lt;code&gt;rollDie&lt;/code&gt; is not skewed and returns each number with equal likelyhood. How is the sum of pips of a double dice roll distributed? The difference? And triple rolls?
}}
2. Using &lt;code&gt; randomNext &lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Seed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rollDie&lt;/code&gt; as defined in the chapter:
 rollNDice :: Int -&gt; Seed -&gt; ([Int], Seed)
 rollNDice 0 seed = ([], seed)
 rollNDice n seed = let (die,  seed0) = rollDie seed
                        (rest, seed1) = rollNDice (n-1) seed0
                    in ((die : rest) ,  
                        seed1)
The function gains the first die and seed and then recursively calls itself to roll N number of die which, once &lt;code&gt;RollNDice&lt;/code&gt; reaches the base case, in turn builds up a list of die. The function then returns the list of die and the final seed that was passed to the base case, &lt;code&gt; rollNDice 0 seed = ([], seed)&lt;/code&gt;.

3. We use mkStdGen to get the computer's random number generator and we give it an arbitrary number, 232. Firstly with &lt;code&gt;import System.Random&lt;/code&gt; at the top of your file:

 type Seed = StdGen

 rollDie1 :: Seed -&gt; (Int, Seed)
 rollDie1 seed = randomR (1,6) seed

In Prelude: 

 Main&gt; rollDie1 (mkStdGen 232)
 (3,1017593109 40692)

=== Threading the State with ''bind'' ===
{{Exercises|1=
#Implement &lt;code&gt;rollNDice :: Int -&gt; Random [Int]&lt;/code&gt; from the previous subsection with &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;.}}

1. You have seen everything below the definition of &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;==)&lt;/code&gt; before. So everything up to that point is just there to set everything up. I've named &gt;&gt;= &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; and return &lt;code&gt;return1&lt;/code&gt; because this chapter uses bind and return to deal with random numbers specifically; whereas the real bind and return are more generalised and thus do not work for reasons that are somewhere over -----------------&gt; there. At least it works; what more do you want from me? Blood? 

With &lt;code&gt;import System.Random&lt;/code&gt; at the top of your file:

&lt;pre&gt;
type Seed = StdGen
type Random1 a = Seed -&gt; (a, Seed)

rollDie :: Random1 Int 
rollDie seed = randomR (1,6) seed

(&gt;&gt;==) :: Random1 a -&gt; (a -&gt; Random1 b) -&gt; Random1 b
(&gt;&gt;==) m g = \seed0 -&gt; 
  let (result1, seed1) = m seed0
      (result2, seed2) = (g result1) seed1
  in (result2, seed2)

return1 :: a -&gt; Random1 a
return1 x = \seed0 -&gt; (x, seed0)

rollNDice1 :: Int -&gt; Random1 [Int]
rollNDice1 0 = return1 []
rollNDice1 n = rollDie &gt;&gt;== (\d1 -&gt; rollNDice1 (n-1) &gt;&gt;== (\rest -&gt; return1 (d1 : rest)))
&lt;/pre&gt;

In prelude:

&lt;pre&gt; 
*Main&gt; rollNDice1 20 (mkStdGen 231)
([4,3,1,1,2,3,5,4,2,5,6,4,6,2,4,5,6,5,1,5],1927676552 238604751)
&lt;/pre&gt;

In case you're wondering: You pass &lt;code&gt;(mkStdGen 232111)&lt;/code&gt; to rollNDice1 because &lt;code&gt;rollNDice 20&lt;/code&gt; on its own only creates a &lt;code&gt;Random1 [Int]&lt;/code&gt;; you need to pass the newly formed &lt;code&gt;Random1 [Int]&lt;/code&gt; a seed, in the form of &lt;code&gt;(mkStdGen 242)&lt;/code&gt;, to get it shooting out random numbers.

=== Input/Output needs ''bind'' ===

{{Exercises|1=&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a function &lt;code&gt;putString :: String -&gt; IO ()&lt;/code&gt; that outputs a sequence of characters with the help of &lt;code&gt;putChar&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The program
  loop :: IO ()
  loop  = return ()   &gt;&gt; loop
loops forever whereas
  loopX :: IO ()
  loopX = putChar 'X' &gt;&gt; loopX
prints an infinite sequence &lt;code&gt;XXXXXX...&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;-s. Clearly, a user can easily distinguish them by looking on the screen. However, show that the model &lt;code&gt;IO a = World -&gt; (a, World)&lt;/code&gt; gives the same [[../Denotational semantics|denotation]] &amp;perp; for both. This means that we have to abandon this model as possible semantics for &lt;code&gt;IO a&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;}}

1. 
 putString :: String -&gt; IO ()
 putString [] = putChar '\n'
 putString (s:xs) = putChar s &gt;&gt; putString xs

===The State Monad===

{{Exercises|1=
Correct the definition for &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; to take the State constructor into consideration.  You'll need to use pattern matching to remove the State constructor.
}}

 (State a) &gt;&gt;= f = State $ \s -&gt; let (a',s') = a s
                                     (State b) = f a'
                                 in b s'

{{Exercises|1=
# Slightly rewrite your definition of (&gt;&gt;=) to use &lt;code&gt;runState&lt;/code&gt; instead of pattern-matching on &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt;
}}

 a &gt;&gt;= f = State $ \s -&gt; let (a',s') = runState a s
                         in runState (f a') s'

== Additional Python Software ==
Python.org contains a central repository of all associated python software at the [http://www.python.org/pypi Cheese Shop].

== Python Editors ==
If you feel that the standard text editor is a bit too simplistic, you might try looking into an [[w:Integrated development environment|IDE]] or other text editing program for editing your Python code.  Python.org has a section of the Cheese Shop dedicated to [http://python.org/moin/PythonEditors/ Python Editors].

=== Idle ===
[http://www.python.org/idle Idle]: The standard IDE included with every download of Python in the Tools/idle subdirectory.

[[w:IDLE (Python)|Wikipedia on Idle]]

==== Platforms ====
All OSes

==== Installing ====
* Windows and OS X: It's already installed!  Just go to your &lt;tt&gt;(PythonDirectory)/Tools/idle&lt;/tt&gt;
* Linux: Please see the instructions for your distribution.

=== PyDev ===

[http://pydev.sourceforge.net/ PyDev]: A Python IDE requiring the [[w:Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] platform.

[[w:PyDev|Wikipedia on PyDev]]

==== Platforms ====
All OSes

==== Installing ====
# Install [http://www.eclipse.org Eclipse].
# Start Eclipse.
# Use Eclipse's update manager, found in the tool bar under &quot;Help&quot; -&gt; &quot;Software Updates&quot; -&gt; &quot;Find and Install&quot;.  Select &quot;Search for New Features&quot;, and add http://pydev.sf.net/updates/ as a &quot;New Remote Site&quot; and let Eclipse do the rest.  Eclipse will now check for any updates to PyDEV when it searches for updates.

=== Eric ===
[http://www.die-offenbachs.de/eric/index.html Eric]: A standalone Python IDE.

[[w:Eric Python IDE|Wikipedia on Eric]]

==== Platforms ====
Linux, FreeBSD, Windows (can someone verify that this doesn't work in OS X?)

==== Installing ====
* Compile from source, or download a prepackaged version for your distribution.

      <comment>added reference to IPython.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Added the following pages as an introduction to python, to replace the existing material, which is a little convoluted and repetitive:
#[[User:MyOwnLittlWorld/Python/Where to go for Help]]
#[[User:MyOwnLittlWorld/Python/Conventions]]
#[[User:MyOwnLittlWorld/Python/Installing Python]]
#[[User:MyOwnLittlWorld/Python/Python: Interactive Mode]]
#[[User:MyOwnLittlWorld/Python/Python: Non-Interactive (Script) Mode]]
#[[User:MyOwnLittlWorld/Python/Things to Keep in Mind]]

And the appendix referenced in the last page:
#[[User:MyOwnLittlWorld/Python/Additional Python Software]]

Please comment on my talk page about how you think these articles are, and whether or not they're an improvement over the current Python introduction (excluding the Overview of Python article, for now, unless someone wants me to remake that too).


If it's decided that we ''need'' to introduce users to at least one IDE, I'd suggest ''Idle'' as it's packaged with Python, thus everyone's guaranteed to have it with minimum effort, and would probably be pretty similar to the text editor that users would be using up to that point. [[User:MyOwnLittlWorld|MyOwnLittlWorld]] 23:22, 4 June 2007 (UTC)

Note: When they begin talk about indentation (probably if clauses) mention how you have to indent lines in the interpreter too or use IPython[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPython]. --[[User:MyOwnLittlWorld|MyOwnLittlWorld]] 22:43, 5 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==  REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS  ==

Requirements analysis is the phase of the project where the requirements of a project are carefully defined. A requirement is a documented need or a description of what a system must accomplish. It is a statement that identifies a necessary attribute, capability, characteristic, or quality of the product of a project.

===  Product  ===

The project's material outcome is its product. The product may be a service, event or a material object. It includes all necessary aspects of the deliverable including training, documentation, etc. Requirements focus on the product itself rather than the ways of achieving the product, leaving the implementation details for later. Requirements that focus on how the product is achieved are said to have implementation bias.

===  Requirements Statement  ===

A requirements statement is a detailed accounting of project objectives. It describes the features, functions and performance constraints of the product. It provide the basis for accepting the product, or describes what must be accomplished for the product to be accepted. 

The following are some useful techniques to understand user requirements:

* Prototyping
** Pilot
* Use Case Modeling
** describes relationship of a software product and it's environment
* JAD (Joint Application Design)
* UML (Unified Modeling Language)
** management tool for object oriented software design

=== Project Description Document ===

The Project Description Document and the Project Requirements are used to identify:

* the high-level value of the project to the sponsor and users
* gaps in the requirements when compared to the project scope
* whether the list of requirements is complete and valid enough to move on to next phase

===  Project Requirements Document - OTN  ===

* all system inputs are defined
* all system outputs are defined
* requirements are validated with sponsors and users
* business rules, special logic, and calculations are defined
* gaps between the requirements and the scope are identified and filled

===  Requirement Characteristics  ===

* necessary range of inputs
* carefully evaluated to be within the project scope
* complete, accurate, and valid

===  Types Of Requirements  ===

* business
* functional
* technical

===  Traceability  ===

* track a requirement to documented need

===  Configuration Management  ===

* ensure descriptions of projects products are correct and complete
* document physical and functional design characteristics

==  REFINE SCOPE  ==

* Scope statement will be included in the project plan
* Scope of a project is usually defined during the initiation phase of a project but the scope can change as needed as more analysis is done

==  WBS (work breakdown structure)  ==

===  WBS key concepts  ===

* hierarchical task list
* decomposition of project into a collection of work units
* use to determine the project work effort
* basis for planning, schedule, budget
* used to estimate resource requirements, activity durations, and costs
* required to create a Gantt chart
* will be included in the project plan statement
* Phase = highest level element of the WBS
* Work Package = lowest level element of the WBS
* one person responsible for each item, although many may work on that item
* formal approval should be obtained for each deliverable
* authority to sign off should be clearly defined
* depicted as
** tree diagram (or hierarchy chart)
** list in outline form with detailed items subordinated to higher-level items.
* schedule and budget contained in WBS?

===  Activity or Task  ===

* may be of any size (a project is a very large activity or task)
* sometimes the terms are synonymous
* sometimes the terms are used to denote a piece of work at a particular level in WBS
** e.g. a phase is broken into activities, and an activity into tasks
* defined in each activity or task
** duration
** cost
** resources
** deliverables

===  SMART: activities or tasks should be  ===

* Specific
* Measurable
* Assignable
* Realistic
* Time-framed

===  Phase  ===

* highest level element of the WBS
* grouping of activities in a project
* meets a major milestone by providing a significant deliverable
** e.g. requirements definition or product design document
* a project is broken down into a set of phases for control purposes
* phase is usually the highest level of breakdown of a project in the WBS.

===  Work Package  ===

* lowest level of the WBS at which project accounting is performed
* usually a week or so in duration and performed by an individual or small work group

===  &quot;Work Package&quot; v &quot;Task&quot; v &quot;Work Unit&quot; v &quot;Activity&quot;  ===

* &quot;task&quot; or &quot;work unit&quot; or &quot;activity&quot; = all ambiguous
* task could be high level, mid-level, or low level, i.e. summary task, sub-task
* work package lowest level for which accounting is performed - unambiguous

===  best practices  ===

* keep work unit duration as short as possible
* work teams should be small

===  hierarchy format e.g.  ===

* 1.0 Main task 1
** 1.1 Subtask 1
** 1.2. Subtask 2
* 2.0 Main task 2
* 3.0 Main task 3

===  Deliverable  ===

* any item produced as the outcome of a project or any part of a project
* project deliverable is differentiated from interim deliverables
* interim deliverables result from activities within the project
* deliverable must be tangible and verifiable
* every element of the WBS (activity or task) must have one or more deliverables.

==  BUILD TEAM  ==

===  Issues  ===

* Contract Labor
* Outsourcing

===  Recruit The Best Candidates  ===

* ask mainly open questions
* develop the interview questions
* develop a mechanism to score responses
* develop a comprehensive job specification
* identify skills, knowledge, and attitudes required for the position

===  Attributes To Look For In A Candidate  ===

* a positive, team-player attitude
* a goal oriented, Can do disposition
* a knowledge of systems and user documentation

===  Resource Capabilities And Resource Availability  ===

* have the greatest impact on the actual duration of project tasks
* have the greatest impact on the estimated per unit labor cost

==  RESPONSIBILITY ASSIGNMENT MATRIX  ==

===  Maps Work To People  ===

===  Authority Structure?  ===

==  ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES  ==

===  Top Down  ===

* estimate effort/cost/duration/risk of project or phase
* looking at the project as a whole
* comparing project to previously performed similar projects
* methods of comparison
** analogous estimating
** direct comparison
** parametric estimating
** using an algorithm
** experts
** estimating from memory

===  ROM (Rough Order of Magnitude)  ===

* estimate effort/cost/duration/risk of project or phase
* done early in a projects to get a ball park figure
* about the same as top down.

===  Parametric  ===

* estimate effort/cost/duration or project or phase
* using an algorithm
* parameters that represent attributes of the project used to calculate
* used in top-down estimating.

===  Analogous  ===

* estimate effort/cost/duration/risk of project or phase
* estimating using similar projects or activities as a basis for determining
* used in top-down estimating

===  Bottom Up  ===

* estimate effort/cost/duration or project or phase
* breaking down into activities, tasks and sub-tasks
* estimating the effort, duration and cost of each task and sub-task
* combine all component estimates to determine the full estimate
* determining duration through a bottom-up approach requires
** sequencing and resource leveling to be done as part of the scheduling process.

===  Cost and Time Estimating Issues  ===

* scope
* task requirements
* resource availability
* resource expense
* original estimations vs actuals

===  FTE = Full Time Equivalent  ===

==  SCHEDULE  ==

===  Process For Creating Schedule  ===

* estimate time and resources for each work unit
** historical data
** expert judgment
* determine dependencies between work units
* level the resources
* create checklists for each work unit
* understand dependency relations between work units
** FF, SS, FS, SF

===  Five Lists Required To Generate Schedule  ===

* deliverables
* project tasks
* required skills
* available skills
* time and resources per task

===  Items Needed To Justify The Schedule  ===

* the project critical path
* actions you have taken
* the tasks with time requirements

===  Sequencing Tasks  ===

* part of the scheduling process
* tasks are positioned serially or parallel based on dependencies between them
* sequencing results in a task network.

===  Dependencies: Types Of  ===

* mandatory
** inherent in the nature of the work
** often involve physical limitations
** hard logic
* discretionary
** defined by project management team
** soft logic
* external
** relationship between project and non-project activities

===  Milestones  ===

* points in time when a deliverable or set of deliverables is available
* denote a significant event such as the completion of a phase
* SMART criteria = Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, Time-framed
* on gantt chart represented by black diamonds
* on tracking gantt chart, slipped milestones represented by white diamond
* an event: no duration or effort
* must be preceded by one or more tasks
** even the beginning of a project is preceded by a set of tasks, may be implied

===  Critical Path  ===

* path(s) in a project network that has the longest duration
* series of activities that determines the earliest completion of the project
* may be more than one critical path
* critical path(s) may change during the project.

===  Float Or Slack  ===

* amount of time available for a task to slip before it delays the project end date
* It is the difference between the task's early and late start dates.

===  Lead  ===

* minimum lapse of time between start of activity and start of overlapping activity

===  Lag  ===

* waiting time between two tasks

===  Gantt Chart  ===

* bar chart that depicts a schedule of activities and milestones
* activities are listed along the left side of the chart
* time line is listed along the top or bottom of the chart
* activities are shown as horizontal bars
* length of activity bars are equivalent to the duration of the activity
* may be annotated with dependency relationships and other schedule-related information.

===  Network Diagram  ===

* graphic tool for depicting the sequence and relationships between tasks
* forms of network diagrams
** PERT Diagram
** Critical Path Diagram
** Arrow Diagram
** Precedence Diagram

===  Pert (Program Evaluation And Review Technique)  ===

* scheduling technique that makes use of
** dependency analysis and critical path to determine the duration of a project
** slack to determine priorities of tasks
* task durations are computed as (Optimistic + 4x Most likely + Pessimistic estimates) / 6)

===  Schedule  ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">==  KICK OFF MEETING  ==

* meet with sponsor to review the output
* a meeting at the beginning of the project or major phase of the project
* align peoples' understanding of project objectives, procedures, and plans
* begin the team-building and bonding process.

* analyze variances, compare estimates to actuals
* handle scope changes
* list, track, try to resolve open issues
* report project status
* push for activity close-out and deliverable sign-off

==  EVM (Earned Value Management)  ==

===  EVM (Earned Value Management)  ===

* a method for integrating scope, schedule and resources
* used for measuring project performance
* compares
** amount of work that was planned (PV)
** what was actually earned (EV)
** what was actually spent (AC)
* determines if cost and schedule performance are as planned.

===  EVA (Earned Value Analysis)  ===

* most commonly used method of performance measurement
* integrates scope, cost and schedule measures
* assesses project performance
* used to identify any divergence from planned outcomes

===  EV (Earned Value)  ===

* EV = PV * % complete (from course prep)
* formerly BCWP (Budgeted Cost Work Performed)
* value of work actually completed

===  PV (Planned Value)  ===

* formerly BCWS (Budgeted Cost Work Scheduled)
* portion of approved cost estimate planned to be spent on activity during given period.
* physical work scheduled to be performed

===  AC (Actual Cost)  ===

* formerly ACWP (Actual Cost Work Performed)
* total costs incurred in accomplishing work during given period.
* occurred to accomplish earned value

===  BAC (Budget at Completion)  ===

* the original total budget allocated to a project.
* sum of all budgets allocated to a project

===  EAC (Estimate at Completion)  ===

* 3 formulas to calculate EAC
** EAC = AC + ETC
** EAC = AC + BAC - EV (variances are atypical)
** EAC = BAC/CPI (from course prep) (variances are expected to occur again at same rate).
* value expressed as either dollars or hours
* represents the projected final costs of work when completed
* actual costs incurred plus estimated cost of remaining work.

===  CPI (Cost Performance Index)  ===

* CPI=EV/AC
* ratio of worth to cost
* measure of cost-efficiency or efficiency of the budget
* CPI &amp;lt; 1.0 means that the task is over budget

===  CV (Cost Variance)  ===

* CV=EV-AC
* difference between worth and cost of completed work
* identifies the area where spending more than budgeted
* CV &amp;lt; 0 means the task is over budget

===  ETC (Estimate to Complete)  ===

* ETC=BAC-EV
* expected additional cost needed to complete an activity or project

===  SV (Schedule Variance)  ===

* SV=EV-PV
* difference between worth and supposed-to-be worth of completed work
* identify schedule problems
* measure of schedule efficiency
* SV &amp;lt; 0 means the task is behind schedule

===  SPI (Schedule Performance Index)  ===

* SPI=EV/PV
* schedule efficiency ratio of earned value accomplished against the planned value
* describes what portion of the planned schedule was actually accomplished.
* SPI &amp;lt; 1.0 means the task is behind schedule

===  TCPI (To Complete Performance Index)  ===

* TCPI=(BAC-EV)/(BAC-AC)
* ratio of remaining work to remaining budget
* efficiency that must be achieved to complete remaining work with remaining money
* TCPI&gt;1 = must increase performance to stay within budget

===  CAPS (Control Account Plans)  ===

* management control unit in which earned value performance measurement takes place
* formerly called Cost Account Plan
* EVM CAPs continuously measure project performance by relating 3 independent variables
** Planned Value
** Earned Value
** Actual Costs

===  Formulas Summary:  ===

* CV=EV-AC
* EAC (Estimate at Completion):
** EAC = AC + ETC
** EAC = AC + BAC - EV
** EAC = BAC/CPI (from course prep)
* CPI=EV/AC
* SV=EV-PV
* SPI=EV/PV
* TCPI=(BAC-EV)/(BAC-AC)
* Funds Remaining (BAC or EAC - AC)
* EV=PV*%complete (from course prep)

===  Formula Mnemonics For Basic Formulas (CV,SV,CPI,SPI)  ===

* &quot;V&quot; in left-most means variance which means subtract
* &quot;I&quot; in left-most means index which means divide
* &quot;EV&quot; on left side of equation after &quot;=&quot;
* if cost &quot;AC&quot; is right-most, otherwise &quot;PV&quot;
* CV=EV-AC
* SV=EV-PV
* CPI=EV/AC
* SPI=EV/PV

===  Formula Mnemonics For TCPI  ===

* TCPI=(BAC-EV)/(BAC-AC)
* remember both num and denom start with BAC-
* no PV
* &quot;I&quot; in left-most means index which means divide
* &quot;EV&quot; on left side of equation after &quot;=&quot;

- baseline

* original project plan plus approved changes. Must have to use EVA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{technique}}
==Introduction==
'''Scalding''' is a technique used in many recipes containing milk. 

To scald milk, you use a heavy bottomed pan or double boiler and bring the temperature of the milk to 85-100°C (185-212°F). At sea level, the milk should just start showing small bubbles and releasing steam at the lower end of this temperature range.

==Tips==
Care must be taken to not allow the pan to heat too quickly, or the solids in the milk will stick to the bottom of the pan and burn or scorch. Scorched milk has a very distinctive and unpleasant taste, and it can ruin the whole pot of milk. Frequent stirring and scraping of the pan bottom will help keep the solids in suspension. 

A lid will help keep a &quot;skin,&quot; caused by surface evaporation, from forming.

==Effects==
The purposes of scalding in any given recipe can be many, as several chemical and biological changes happen during the process.

Many pathogens are killed at these temperatures and natural enzymes are neutralized. Pasteurization often achieves the same effect, but can take place at lower temperatures (about 63°C (145°F)) so one must be sure that scalding is not required for other reasons before assuming that the step can be skipped.

Some milk proteins unfold at scalding temperatures. In yogurt making, this allows for a tighter matrix to form as the proteins refold in the acidic environment, resulting in less whey separation and a firmer end product. This unfolding of protein also seems to help in bread making, resulting in a finer crumb and better rise.

The higher temperature could also be utilized as an essential element of cooking, e.g. helping sugar dissolve or cooking eggs in custards,and to better incorporate flavors.  Basically, all the different flavors of the ingredients (whether complimentary and/or contrasting) will &quot;come together&quot; better at a hotter temperature. No person wishing to brew tea, to use an analogy, would insert a tea bag in a cup of cold water for the purpose.</text>

== All Books ==

This is a list of all books that I have started, or that I have done significant work on. The letters next to the title of a book are the '''status codes''' that show what state the book is in. A description of the book will be shown below the title to elaborate these codes. All books are to be considered a work-in-progress.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page should contain guidelines to writing good Io code.  Please contribute your wisdom, but in the interest of making it easier for readers to find things, please keep each major heading in alphabetical order.
----

== On Assignments ==

* Use ''setters'' whenever possible, instead of direct assignment.
** ''Read/Write Attributes'', often found in other languages, can be simulated by overriding the '''setSlot''' method on an object.  Unless you have an impeccable argument for doing so, however, '''don't.'''  You'll just make your program slower to run and increase the opportunity for bugs.
** Setters have the advantage of being more legible in the long-term.  Telling an object to '''setForeground(Color White)''' makes more sense ''when reading'' (and hence, when maintaining) the code than '''fgPen = Color White'''.
* Consider direct assignment on external objects as harmful.
** Let the external object decide how to affect its own state.
** ''Tell'' the object what to do; it generally knows &quot;how to do it&quot; better than you do.
** If an external object lacks a method to effect the state changes you consider necessary, write one.  Remember that Io lets you do this, even for code you didn't write yourself.

== On Initialization ==

* In keeping with methods with three or fewer arguments, use setters to initialize object state as necessary.
* Some objects will maintain some non-trivial state.  The '''init''' method should:
** be used to initialize object state to known-good defaults ''only,'' only only when necessary.
** ''not'' be used to initialize fields which acquire default '''literal''' or '''immutable''' values (e.g., 0, &quot;&quot;).  Inherit them from a prototype instead.
** ''definitely'' be used to initialize fields which acquire default dynamically-created values (e.g., list(), etc.).  Otherwise, such a value is shared by all instances of the object.
** not be used as a replacement for setters, which serve to ''alter'' the configuration of the object from its default state.
* To facilitate isolation and testability, rely on ''dependency injection''.
** Do not attempt to acquire resources unless absolutely necessary, including files, windows, network sockets, et. al.  Accept them as arguments instead.
** Remember: the object has domain-specific knowledge about itself, and specializes in itself and only itself.  Keep it that way.
** '''Example:''' A spreadsheet object maintains a matrix of data which includes formulae as well as literal data.  It knows nothing about how this information is stored in a data file.  Instead, ''impex'' (short for ''imp''orter/''ex''porter) objects are used to either read data from a file and stuff the spreadsheet appropriately, or query the spreadsheet and write out a data file accordingly.  A ''view'' object is just a special kind of exporter: one which renders the data to the screen instead of to a file.  This could take the familiar form of a matrix, or it could take the form of a multi-valued chart of some kind.  Likewise, the keyboard and mouse, combined, form a special kind of importer interface.  Therefore, loading and saving spreadsheets is reduced to an automation of the manual task of data entry, made possible only by the fact that the spreadsheet ''doesn't care'' where the data is coming from or going to, only that the data is ''correct.''
* Keep object state as small as possible.
** References to other objects should exist only to allow the object to do its job.
** Objects which end up performing two or more jobs should be refactored into two or more objects.

== On Methods and their Arguments ==

* Method names should begin with a lowercase letter, to preserve the established coding conventions of Io.
* Passing greater than three arguments to a method suggests that the object should be refactored.
** Minimize the number of arguments to methods.
** Use a &quot;parameter object&quot; which serves as an argument collection.
** Always return '''self''' in the absence of any other useful value, allowing other object methods to be chained together.
** Use method chains to refactor methods that would otherwise take more than three arguments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Unit Choice==

The course is made of 41 units. Students take a maximum of 18:

{|
|Award
|6 units
|= 1 A-level
|-
|Certificate
|12 units
|= 2 A-levels
|-
|Diploma
|18 units
|= 3 A-levels
|}

Some units are compulsory and some are optional.

==Method of Assessment==

All units are assessed by written coursework, which is initially assessed by the school/college and then checked by Edexcel.


==Making the Grade==

The work must be your own. Copying large chunks of text from a book or the internet is not allowed - ''even if you credit where you obtained the text''.

Check the requirements of each unit and make sure your work meets those requirements. Work which is not on the syllabus will not improve your grade, so don't waste your time with it.

Tip: Use the specification to write headings for your assignments, and research material for each heading. This way you should cover all the topics required: It will be obvious which parts of your assignment need further work. Putting your research into headed sections will prevent you copying or paraphrasing a large chunk from one source, and then a large chunk from another source without comparing the two sources on what they say point-by-point.

Note every reference you use&lt;ref&gt;Even note sources you read, but didn't find helpful - it is evidence that you have researched thoroughly.&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''References''': &lt;references/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi there.

Figured I'd introduce myself.

I'm a Geek living/working in Pittsburgh PA.

My interestes are varied, but since the cooking Wikibook got me in, I'll focus on that.

I've been cooking for almost as long as i can remember. I'm in a Medieval Recreation group, and I've cooked in many of those kitchens preparing
feasts for 1-200 people. I like to experiment, and try to approach cooking
more as an art than a science... although it's difficult to seperate the two.
Alton Brown is my hero! ;)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many important theorems of Model Theory do not hold when restricted to the finite case, like Gödel's completeness theorem or the compactness theorem:

==Failure of Compactness Theorem==
Consider the following sentence σ3

&lt;math&gt;\exists_x \exists_y \exists_z (x\ne y \and y\ne z \and x\ne z)&lt;/math&gt;

that says that there are at least 3 different elements in a universe.  One can expand σ3 easily for n other than 3.  So, let Σ = {σ1, σ2, σ3, ...} be the infinite set of all these sentences.  Now Σ is obviously not satisfiable by a finite model, although every finite subset of Σ is.  Ok, but why does that matter?  One of the most useful tools in general Model theory is the Compactness theorem, stating: &quot;Let Σ be a set of FO sentences.  If every finite subset of Σ is satisfiable, then Σ is satisfiable.&quot;  But as just shown this doesn't hold for the finite case, thus there is no Compactness theorem in Finite Model Theory!

I am planning to completely delete the Help: namespace overtime. All pages will be merged into help books like [[Using Wikibooks]], or [[Editing Wikitext]] as appropriate. If needed, we can create additional books too. Eventually, all Help: pages will be deleted, and the entire Help: namespace can be removed. This is a ''very'' long-term project. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:57, 8 December 2008 (UTC)

== [[Help:Contents]] ==

This is a navigational map of the current Wikibooks Help namespace and directly linked pages in other namespaces, using [[Help:Contents]] as a root node. This is how the help namespace looks currently, and this list should not be changed. Red links on this page represent red links in the help namespace. Do not create these pages now, because creating such pages might be counter to the plan.

For a list of all pages in the help namespace, including those which are not currently linked from [[Help:Contents]], see [[Special:Prefixindex/Help:]].

== Rationale ==

Reasons for wanting to create several &quot;help books&quot; instead of a single amorphous help namespace:
#Lead by Example. Show contributors an example of a good book as a model to follow for creating new books. Book will use a proper naming convention, an LMOS, proper and consistent navigation and formatting, etc.
#Able to quickly and easily separate information according to intended target audience (readers, writers, admins, newbies, etc). Certain topics can be presented differently, depending on the reader.
#Help pages should be instructional, and advanced topics should build upon basic topics. Such a linear structure lends itself nicely to a textbook with a narrative.
#Provide a logical organization of pages, by using a &quot;book/page&quot; naming convention. Grouping like topics together by prepending them with a common bookname.
#Easy ability to create navigational and style templates to suit particular books.
#Editing the help namespace becomes exactly the same as editing any ordinary book. More users will feel empowered to help improve it because it will be more familiar.
#Help books created in this way will be easy to find through regular navigation tools such as [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves]], etc. New help books can be easily requested at [[Wikibooks:Requested books]]. 
#New help books can be easily added to the shelf at any time, to account for new or missing information. 
#Changes can be made to a single book without having to make those changes to the entire help namespace.

== [[Help:Contents]] ==

Changed to be a &quot;help bookshelf&quot;, including the books below and other books from the main module namespace that directly deal with Mediawiki: [[MediaWiki Administrator's Handbook]], [[History of Wikibooks]], etc. We will need a &quot;help bookshelf&quot; template, and we will need to add it to the list at [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Program Description==
GuessMe is a wonderful, enjoyable game based upon the simple concept of guessing a number.  In this game, the player interacts with the calculator in a sort of dialogue.  When the program is initiated, a Main Menu opens and the player is given five options:
#1,000
#10,000
#100,000
#HI SCORES
#QUIT
Option 4 types up a screen which displays the current high score for each of the three difficulty levels, and Option 5 simply quits the program and returns to the main calculator entry screen.  If the player selects Option 1, 2, or 3, the game will begin.  The game begins by the calculator choosing a random number for the player to guess.  If the player chose Option 1, then the number chosen by the calculator will be any number from 1 to 1000.  The maximum number for Option 2 is 10000 and the maximum number for option 3 is 100000.  This means that there are three difficulty levels that the player can choose from and that the calculator will save a separate high score for each difficulty which can all be seen on the High Score page by selecting Option 4 from the Main Menu.  After selecting a number for the player to guess, the calculator tells the player what is going on and prompts him for his first guess.  It does so with these messages:  &quot;Im thinking of a number between 1 and 1,000...&quot; (This will say &quot;10,000&quot; in difficulty 2 and &quot;100,000&quot; in difficulty 3), &quot;What is it?&quot;  The player can then enter his first guess.

After each guess, the calculator will respond with a message saying &quot;Higher&quot; if the player's guess was too low or &quot;Lower&quot; if the player's guess was too high.  In difficulty 3, the calculator may also say &quot;Much higher&quot; or &quot;Much lower&quot;.
&lt;br&gt;If the player guesses a number which is less than 1 or more than the maximum, the calculator will respond with, &quot;Hey!  I said it was between 1 and 1,000!&quot; (As before, this final number will depend on which Option was chosen).
&lt;br&gt;If the player's guess is within 1 number of the answer then the calculator will say &quot;Youre SO close!  Just a little higher!&quot; or &quot;Youre SO close!  Just a little lower!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;After 20 guesses, the calculator will taunt the player with the message, &quot;Hurry it up!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;After 30 guesses, the calculator says &quot;Gosh!  You take forever!!!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;The only other message that the calculator might show to the player is one that will only be displayed if the player cheats to guess the answer on his first try or if by chance he guesses the secret number on his very first try.  If this is done, the calculator will simply say, &quot;YOU CHEATER!&quot; and the program will abruptly end.

When the player eventually guesses the correct number, a series of messages will be displayed.  The first is: &quot;You got it!!!&quot;, followed by the correct answer, then &quot;In this many tries:&quot;, followed by the number of guesses it took the player to find the number.  Then, if the player has broken the high score for that difficulty level, he will see the message, &quot;HIGH SCORE!!&quot;

Note:  The variables used by the calculator to operate GuessMe are stored in the [J] matrix.

Ethmoid cancer

==Risk factors==
*Occupational
**Sawdust, cement dust - ethmoid adenocarcinoma
**Exposure to thoratrast, nickel, cadmium, formaldehyde
*Pollution
*Smoking
*HPV (SCC)
*?chronic sinusitis
    
==Pathology==
*SCC most common
*Mucoepidermoid
*Adenoid cystic
*Adenocarcinoma
*Rare:
**Olfactory neuroblastomas (esthesioneuroblastoma)
**Angiosarcoma
**Rhabdomyosarcoma
**Lymphoma

==Natural history==
*Usually well differentiated, slow growing
*Present due to local invasion beyond sinus although can sometimes present due to sinusitis or nasal obstruction
*Tumours commonly invade through bone - through cribriform plate to anterior cranial fossa, or lamina papyracea to orbit
      
==Route of spread==
*Primarily through local invasion; nodal metastases are uncommon (&lt; 20%, even lower for adenoid cystic)
*Nodal involvement is more common when there is extension into surrounding tissues
*Sinuses themselves are lymphatic poor
*First echelon lymph nodes are retropharyngeal 
        
==Presentation==
*Facial or nasal pain
*Epistaxis
*Sinus obstruction
*Trismus (pterygoid involvement)
*Ocular symptoms: diplopia, visual disturbance, proptosis
*Neural involvement eg trigeminal neuralgia

==Staging==
See [[Radiation_Oncology/Head_%26_Neck/Sinonasal/Staging|Staging]]

==Outcomes==
*Local control 50-60%
*Overall survival 30-50% at 5 years
    
==Management==
*Most evidence is via retrospective single institution reports
*Options:
**Surgery (eg craniofacial resection, orbital exenteration)
***Often difficult as locally advanced by the time of presentation
***May include orbital exenteration if there is orbital invasion
**Radiotherapy
***Unclear whether preop or postop RT is better
****Preop chemoRT may improve resectability
***Adjuvant treatment does appear to increase local control although there exists no randomised data to confirm this
***Radiotherapy as definitive management is most appropriate
****Difficult resection anatomically
****Dose 70Gy definitive, with chemotherapy for advanced lesions
****Comprehensive nodal irradiation (retropharyngeal nodes) only if node positive or extrasinus involvement (skin, muscle)
****Dose limiting structures
*****Eye, optic chiasm
*****Brain
****Technique
*****Ant and wedged laterals (posterior to eye)
*****Treat neck nodes prophylactically if there is skin/muscle involvement otherwise target volume is antrum alone</text>

=Alekhine's Defence=
White still has a space advantage, but Black is intending to attack the c- and d-pawns with moves like ...Nc6 and ...Bg7. Meanwhile, White has not yet moved any pieces and needs to develop. Most modern masters prefer to wait with Nf3, since such a knight can quickly become a target to ...Bg4, so the most common move is 6.Nc3.

Hi, I have some images that need movement/deletion due to a typo in the filename. The culprits are
&lt;br&gt;[[:Image:Laybrinth-Finger.png]] --move-&gt; [[:Image:Labyrinth-Finger.png]]
&lt;br&gt;[[:Image:Laybrinth-Thread.png]] --move-&gt; [[:Image:Labyrinth-Thread.png]]
&lt;br&gt;[[:Image:Laybrinth-Zipper.png]] --delete-&gt; .
&lt;br&gt;I already uploaded a new version of [[:Image:Labyrinth-Zipper.png]], so the old name can be deleted (or ported as an old version into the new name if you want to do so). -- [[User:Apfelmus|&lt;font color=&quot;lime&quot;&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;p&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;f&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;e&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;l&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#770077&quot;&gt;m&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;u&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;s&lt;/font&gt;]]

Thanks for the speedy response. I uploaded to the new names, the old pages can be deleted now.

== WMOG etc ==

While I was trawling thro I noticed there were a few pages (I think) that did not have the WMOG category on them?  Do you want me to add them on the next run (I picked them up from your contributions - good job it is a fast broadband - then filtered them).

Very best wishes for 2007 and hope it brings you and your family good things (&amp; maybe even checkuser status &lt;g&gt;) - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:17, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

Explained situation to partner - she laughed and said at least you know me better now! 

So... I guess I will leave it for now rather than mess up your year any more (today) but it really is very easy to deal with cats via awb if I know what I'm doing (&amp; it was not running &quot;auto&quot; and I got a &quot;popup&quot; saying there was a message as a point of interest - won't let you work without going to it).  I'll go and try and work out how you are organising it - you have a think about how I can help.  

On the one below I will look out the notes but I really would like to see a &quot;peer review&quot; for quality thing - we may follow policy but that does not ensure quality (IMO) quite often.  I guess there are some pages not cat'd and not on bookshelves that I am pleased aren't there cos they are bad! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:13, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

Wish I'd talked to you/you'd talk to me - RFC - was working towards a &quot;review of book&quot; type idea myself looking to improving the standard of offerings.

==Hello==

The format is Wikipedia, but it doesn't exist anywhere on it, as time progresses I'm going to fix up broken links--and other tweaks.    BookManOne 20:22, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

:::No, I didn't know there was a wikipedia article about it.  I just read it and thought it would be good to start an article about it.  If you don't think it works for this site, then by all means, I don't mind you deleting it. BookManOne 02:18, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

::Actually, you've just given me a great idea, let me do some research and think about this guy's (Norcross') text a little bit more, so I can get time to fix it up.  Can you mark the page so that people know I'm going to research for it or something? BookManOne 03:00, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

==IRC==
OK - I just want to make it clear that for a number of reasons - some technical &amp; some circumstances - I will not be on IRC as far as I can see for a while.  You and anyone else who wants me will just have to use talk pages - sorry and regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:58, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

== My notes ==
OK - not at all extensive as other things intervened but I did hope to bring it out quite soon.  If it can be usefully worked in with RFC then there should be a double benefit.

''B f R page plans

''Book for Review

''This would enable an editor to bring a book or part of a book to people for an informal review.  It is possible that consideration here might lead to offers of help and assiatance or a move towards deletion.  It could be that it is the content that is worrying someone rather than the layout or writing style - again this would be able to be a halfway house between hoping that it gets better and a VfD''

I think I realised that we needed to involve &quot;active editors&quot; at that point and that took my time.  The idea probably came from here [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Staff_lounge/Archive_25#Who_are_the_final_arbiters_of_Wikibooks_content].

Are you planning to &quot;launch&quot; this - Staff lounge, Bulletin board etc and will it be in shape for a gazette mention?

Hear from you --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:58, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

:Bugger - broadband was &quot;off&quot;  - Well as I didn't know anything about RfC...!
:The lounge has become far more active even in the last couple of months (and great because we are getting more people involved).  Some sort of splitting would probably be good and looking at it RfC could filter out quite a lot of stuff from SL usefully. It seems the SL had the same problem in the past if the &quot;side box&quot; is anything to go by.  BUT the stuff in those links is mostly ancient &amp; that is the first time I've poked there - it certainly is not obvious as it stands. If there is to be a sub page structure it requires better definition for content and greatly improved navigation for users?
:As for BfR I'm happy it sits with RfC - there is a common theme here.  I really would prefer to see stuff appear in VfD that had been thro a gentler process first.  I would also like to see that having been thro BfR some things got much better but we do need a &quot;peer review&quot; group around

As you can tell, we'll be continuing the WikiBooks process during the Spring semester.  I wonder if you could take a minute and check out our new book [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Social_and_Cultural_Foundations_of_American_Education] to see what you think of it.  Thanks, and have a great day!

I'm finding her presence a little bit invasive. It doesn't seem right to jam your style into another site. I'll try to watch her edits myself, but she's already made a few bad naming and location decisions with all her userpages and templates she's creating which is creating all these redirects, so someone probably needs to follow through and clean up. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:34, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

== You've been a big help and now another question ==

Hi Johnny,

This is Dwight Allen, one of the co-editors of the Social and Cultural Foundations of Education.  I'm a professor of educational reform at Old Dominion University where the first edition has been successfully used as the principal textbook in the basic foundations course I taught last semester.  We are now on the way to the creation of the second edition.  Peter Baker has been particularly grateful for your help and support as we all have been learning as we go.  We now have other graduate students trying Wikibooks in their classes/schools, and another faculty member plans to do so as well.

Now I have another question for you.  I am working with a group you may have heard of called Global Text.  Their plan is to create a 1,000 text library to serve as basic texts for an entire college/university curriculum.  Their model for text creation is very different than ours, but they are considering possible convergences.  I would like to offer our 2nd or 3rd edition to Global Text for their &quot;publication.&quot;  They are concerned about the compatibility of GNU with their platform, Creative Commmons.  Can you help us figure out a way to proceed.  I note that in your contribution to Wikibooks Junior (How Things Work) that they simply offer to identify anyone who chooses as an author.  We would be pleased to do so as well, but the Global Text folks are concerned that unless we get the agreement of each individual author (from commas on up) that they can't import it to their data base.  Any suggestions?  

If you like, I can email you the exchange I have had with them.

Dwight Allen

== Sad Times ==

I was in my night class, got your voice mail, can't get on IRC till later tonight. I can certainly understand the frustration people are feeling here, but I contend that we ''are'' making progress. Wikibooks is becoming a better place (I can see it if nobody else can). What's the most sad to me is that a few small issues are going to cost us some of our most valuable members. Not everybody has the same endless pool of patience and optimism that I seem to have on these matters, however. There are clear problems that we can solve now, and I think we should be able to put most of these problems behind us forever.

That's my hope at least, and I believe in the mission of wikibooks enough to believe it's possible. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[user:Whiteknight/Book Foundry|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:06, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

In addition to matt's decision concerning Panic and the block, in laid down 3 conditions of my own: That you can't discipline panic anymore in the future (should he ever return), that the contributors to the C++ book better learn to play nice (again, should panic ever return), and that the actions by matt and myself on this matter are not really open for review. I endorse him 100%, and I'm certain the feeling is mutual. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[user:Whiteknight/Book Foundry|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:33, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

== Suggestion ==

If you want to try that out, fine by me. I wanted a similar yet more direct process and he rejected it. Assuming we as the community do this (even though you want to be the only one talking to Panic), the block should be extended to be indefinite until the process fails or succeeds. I consider that essential. Your process sounds sane should Panic cooperate. Contrary to my ideas regarding discussions across the project, this discussion could be considered private by some users who have recently opposed Panic's block and so I think you should get a consensus opinion before doing this just to make sure everyone's happy. You could also just do this without consensus which seems fine to me, but now I'm being attacked because apparently I was scheming away on IRC for weeks. Do your best I guess. Create a page somewhere to discuss this, then have the real process at Panic's talk of course. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:55, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

== re: Post-arbitration-decision &quot;coaching&quot; ==
These are my concerns. I am concerned that individuals continue to act unilaterally in this situation. In my view, each time individuals act unilaterally to supersede what has gone before it makes the situation worse. If the remedy is going to be changed, it should be done through community consensus in a public place where interested parties can find and comment on it easily. Nothing needs to be done immediately. Anything done without clear and visible community sanction is likely to fail. Also, I have concerns that this will be additional stress and burden for you. I believe that in order for Panic to be readmitted to Wikibooks, there needs to be a clear public statement from him recognizing the things he did which led to his ban. Before doing anything, please, set up a page for community review of the alternate remedy you propose. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 03:14, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

== Printable Version of Book ==

Hi Johnny,
Hope you're surviving the bitter cold up there.  A colleague here at ODU has requested a printed version of our book, and I wonder if you can help clarify the following directions I found at [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Print_versions#Preparing_book|the instructions page]]:  

Create page Book/Print version and link to it from TOC 

Insert {{print version notice|Book|Book/Print_version}} template to its top 

Copy the TOC as an ordered list 

Insert every chapter like a template, preceded by chapter title. Remember about chapter with list of authors. 
 Chapter name 


Insert text of GNU Free Documentation License by adding: 
 GNU Free Documentation License  
 


Specifically, I'm confused about the policy for establishing and naming the print version.  Should/May I simply title it &quot;Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education:  Print version&quot;?  Second, I'm concerned about inserting &quot;every chapter like a template&quot;.  What does this mean?  When I list the chapters, will I list the entire name 

(i.e. Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education/Second Edition/Chapter 1 | Chapter 1: Philosophy and Ethics)

or just the visible part of the name -- Chapter 1: Philosophy and Ethics?

I'd sure appreciate any advice you can offer me, and have a great day!

== Image question ==

Hey Johnny, just a quick question for you about images. I'm not sure whether to upload my images on Wikibooks or on Commons, I created them myself for my [[User:Mattb112885/Proposed stoichiometry book|Stoichiometry]] book (which I have on my user space since it's just a lot of redlinks right now and I'd like to get somewhere on it and figure out a good name for it before I move it to the main space) but I doubt they would be useful anywhere else, though I would not mind using a free license/PD for my work... what would you suggest?

Thank you for your help. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 03:45, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

: Thank you for your response. The particular images are specific to one example in my book, and there will probably be quite a few more coming that are also for specific examples in this book, so unless wikiversity wants to use the same examples as I use, it wouldn't be useful. A German translation, it might be useful, I'll have to see if I can find a language-neutral way to incorporate the images into the book, if I can then I'll upload them to commons. I always forget this project is multilingual. Regards, [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 14:59, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Transwiki Imports|Wikibooks:Import Policy]] ==

Thanks, Johnny,

I've talked with the students about this a bunch since we had some minor copyright issues with it last semester, too.  I will read the literature on the topic and make sure I'm well-versed on this, and then I'll have another chat with everyone about copyright info. tomorrow in class.  By the way, I really appreciate the understanding, flexible way you mention this to me.  Administrators like you and [[User:Whiteknight]] are the most vital components that will keep Wikibooks successful!  Thanks for your continued support and patience.

== Oversight ==

So you like me that much!

In practice I removed all aspects of this from watchlist sometime ago.  However I really do see it as being in the interest of community to resolve - I am reluctant to be involved but at present we do not seem to be moving forward and the community does need that.  Under no circumstances would I wish to be involved in re-opening arbitration.  The issue seems to be to get Panic to agree to be part of community on the community's terms and I do feel that he should remain blocked until this can be achieved.  IF the community agree on this (miracles could occur I guess) I would be prepared to act as oversight BUT I will have conditions that I would want agreed by the community - my back has a sensitivity to knife wounds.  May not be what you want, in which case sorry but get back to me - I don't like the festering wound that is left.  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:31, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

::I guess I would like to see some evidence of explicit consensus tho a whole lot of voting may be a bit much.  The community seem to have agreed to you - not to my participation and I think they should.  Otherwise I will find myself in a possibly untenable position.  That said the sooner things get going the better.  I guess it would be good to seek out the views of Xania &amp; Xixtas at the very least - maybe you would point them to this and the staff lounge stuff?
::Blockwise I see no real need to do anything - Panic just has to know that a new block will be applied as soon as the old one expires unless we have sorted this out.  I would be prepared to re-block Panic if we have not managed to resolve the issue by the time the block expires (I do not like the idea but this needs resolving).  I guess my &quot;community consensus&quot; in part consist of the community agreeing that I &amp; only I will be responsible for blocking and unblocking Panic?

I think you can handle all this yourself, but the community will be reading what you do nonetheless and can say something on your talk if they need to. Set his blocks up now and start the process like you planned because I don't see anything stopping you; all (essentially) have agreed to your proceedings. I plan on being a reader only from now on.

== Party Time ==

I see the Panic process has had an awesome start, but I wondered why you're using two-week blocks. As far as principles are concerned, I don't see why an indefinite block isn't used. If you continually add two-week blocks, you're really doing the same thing. Is this just to avoid complaints? Logically your terms send the idea that the blocks will exist until a solution is found, so I don't see the point to these short-term blocks and it leaves more room for error should you miss a re-blocking time. It will also fill Panic's block log with blocks. If you ramp up the blocking period over time, I could perhaps understand that although that seems more like a &quot;punishment&quot;.

Also, should we and others as admins actually react to the unblock request? I realize this goes against your &quot;one-on-one&quot; discussion with Panic, but if he puts that in technically I think we should respond. I assume the consensus admin opinion will of course be a denial of the unblock, but we don't want to ignore policies. Tell me if unblock responses aren't in policy anywhere and I'll just ignore it, something we'll effectively be doing with a decision anyway. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 15:34, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

:It's party time because Panic is back and I'm sure this process will be filled with fun and excitement. I'll let the process continue for a bit of course, but maybe after the second or third two-week block I might ask again about changing the block time period. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:24, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

::I don't think that we need to respond to the unblock template, it's currently not part of policy that we need to respond to it at all (my unstable branch of the administrator policy is taking this into account). Also, I want to agree with Matt here, that after a few short-term blocks, if we aren't making any progress, the block should likely just be made indefinite.

Objections to the:
#Inclusion of the GFDL on that page (GFDL is already on the bottom of every page, and is (at least it was) added into the book version for printing)
#Removal of the before title of the work (before the fork) even if the book does no longer exist on Wikibooks due to the merge, and per GFDL reference is needed.
#Alteration to the wording I would prefer restoring the template but I will leave it up to your, I strongly object to the change in &quot;who may have donated contents&quot;, if they didn't it would be a violation of Wikibooks policy and GFDL.
#Removal of the anonymous contributor (unsung heroes) by removing and giving me single authorship of the work, I get all the control, I could in a last degree even request the pull down of the work from wikibooks or remove the GFDL in any copy I would make of the work (this may depend on the authorizations and rights of the other works used but with some content removal it would be legal).

== Panic's Puppets ==

The creation of these alternate accounts is unacceptable. He may think he's creative by doing this to &quot;prove his point&quot; but it is still considered an extremely bad faith move and everyone should know that's not the way to do things or to effectively convey a message. He's now using at least one of the accounts to continue discussions with you here, something that should be done at his talk page alone since he's '''blocked'''. Just because there isn't a mention of sockpuppets in the blocking policy doesn't mean these users can't be blocked. There is a myriad of other policies and guidelines about good faith, civility, etc. that forbid this sort of action. We are not a courtroom here and we don't need to prove that Panic is truly behind these puppets either, even though he specicially mentioned he was using one to comment on your talk page here which is a direct association to his actions. These accounts need to be blocked immediately. You may see this as interfering with your process, but Panic's actions are a direct violation of the one path to a solution that was given which was through you. Panic himself should also be blocked infinitely (or indefinitely if you prefer although this action has invalidated the solution process to me). If you do not wish to do this then please say so and I or another admin will commit the blocks because this is ridiculous. I considered myself finished with all the useless discussion on this issue but now that he's effectively vandalizing pages by puppeting around and deliberately avoiding his block, things have changed. I and other admins should have no problem with continually blocking new IPs he uses from now forward. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 13:56, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

:I'm with Matt on this one. I understand the &quot;point&quot; he was trying to make, and i also understand the humor in it. Many policies were written expressly to be open to interpretation, such as the good faith and civility policies. Even though it isn't stated anywhere &quot;thou shalt block sockpuppets&quot; I still think it's unacceptable behavior and should be dealt with. Using sockpuppets to circumvent a user block is exceptionally bad faith on panic's part, and should not be tolerated by you or the rest of the community. 
:I would insert language about blocking sockpuppets into the [[Wikibooks:Blocking guideline|Wikibooks:Blocking Policy]], but there are enough unrelated objections on that page already to slow the entire process down. I've proposed a new draft at [[Wikibooks:Sockpuppets]] that might expedite this particular matter, but there will likely be the standard &quot;we dont need another policy document&quot;, or &quot;isn't this assumed already&quot;, or &quot;we should merge this into WB:WIW/Unstable instead&quot;.

::Although I'd prefer immediate action to be taken, I guess letting some others hear about this before committing the blocks for a day or two isn't unreasonable. For the time being however, someone must be watching those puppets since he's already used GoToMan to make edits in the C++ book. Certainly all these accounts should be infinitely blocked. Again, I think Panic should be infinitely blocked but of course you can still talk to him all you want and maybe propose to the community at a later date that he's ready to have his block lifted. His recent actions to me say that he's no longer an &quot;indefinite&quot; case but an &quot;infinite&quot; case until perhaps he changes something in the somewhat-near future, but not too near. If there's a technical issue with making that happen, then I guess indefinite will do.

:::I don't understand the problem.  Wikibooks doesn't forbid secondary accounts so how is Panic doing any wrong?  His 'Panic' account has been blocked so naturally he's created a new account.  What do you expect people to do when their account is blocked?  He probably sees it as his only way to stay on Wikibooks.

::::You '''''must''''' be joking!

::::Of course Wikibooks forbids secondary accounts in the way you've described! You cannot be blocked and then just create another account to continue as if nothing happened; you're blocked for a reason. If someone is blocked, then they '''as a person, not just an account''' are implicitly blocked from the site. That's the best we can do with our current technology. An account represents edits and that's what we block, but we're blocking that '''person's''' actions and behavior. Sockpuppets are terribly bad faith and subversive to our practices here. There is no problem when a user creates multiple accounts to serve different purposes, but if one is blocked then that person should not continue with the others. 
::::If a user is very careful then perhaps they can create a new account some time later and re-integrate, although we hope that process won't succeed. Panic's unique language style for one will prevent that by how I see it. We as admins must now block all IPs he uses to re-inject himself since '''he''' is blocked, not Panic2k4 specifically. He is '''expected''' to remain off the project until unblocked (besides the communication through his talk page). -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 16:45, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

:I think you need to make it ''very clear'' to panic that if he continues acting like a child like this, he won't ever be allowed back. Worse then that, i am tempted to have him labled as a permanent &quot;nuisance&quot; (since he isn't exactly a vandal), and require that all puppets and IPs used by him be blocked on sight from now on. All he had to do was say &quot;I should have tried to be more understanding&quot;, or something like that, and he would already be back. Instead, he refused to say anything, threw a temper tantrum, and is now flagrantly disregarding our behavioral norms. I know you are endlessly compassionate on this matter, but my patience with it all has grown painfully thin. Proceed as you will (since we did all put you in charge here), but that's my opinion for what it's worth. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[user:Whiteknight/Book Foundry|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:40, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

::My suggestion in this would be to treat him like a normal vandal. We will infinitely block him and all accounts he uses like we usually would. Elevating Panic to any sort of special status is his desire. Discounting him and treating him like normal vandal trash is exactly what we need to do. Once he realizes no one cares, he'll stop doing whatever part of this gives him his kicks. As long as we make it clear to everyone that notices his edits that he's the loser in all this, we'll have no problems. This is business as usual and he'll tire in a much shorter period than all other active contributors defending the project will. We shouldn't even discuss him anymore since he tanked himself. His talk page will be his only outlet now. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:57, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

:::He's not a &quot;normal vandal&quot;, he's a disruptive sockpuppeteer. The only thing that make him unique in that is that he's the first sockpuppeteer on English Wikibooks (they're a dime a dozen on Wikipedia and Commons). As far as how to treat it, the only difference should be that any and all IPs he uses should be blocked as well... if he can edit from them, they're obviously Open Proxies. 
:::I wouldn't count on him getting bored with it too soon by the way.

Please make it clear to Panic that if he continues to create new accounts and use the User talk namespace as a continuation of his soapbox then his chances of having a shortened block period will be even more remote. Although User talk allows for some personal material, creating new puppets and filling their pages with this essentially translates to polluting the namespace and yet another act of bad faith. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 06:55, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

Absolutely not. I already said this, but he isn't even approved to be unblocked since the process isn't over. Even though I personally do not support this, the community's decision showed that as well. He can complete discussions at his talk page. There is no utility in letting him edit elsewhere. Cool Cat can work on his talk page, a single page, since that's what he'd be doing anyway. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 03:11, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

Hello! I was looking through the [[:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]], and was just wondering under what circumstances such work regarding a work of fiction is acceptable. I've looked through the policies and guidelines, including the guide to deletion, but couldn't find any guidance on the issue. Is this more of an informal, &quot;in-practice&quot; type of thing? The Wikias normally aren't geared toward study and annotation a work, nor is Wikipedia. I would like to do some work of this type, any guidance as to when it would be allowed would be appreciated.

==[[CCNA Certification]]==
SB Johhny - The point was asking for a review of two things - not so much the contents of the outline, but more the structure and to a certain extent style.  What I'm looking for in the review is feedback about specific pros and cons of the outline and style I'm using.  

::For example, I start with a template that gives the reader the ability to navigate from any page to any other page to browse the book.  Is this good, or is it wasteful of wikibooks resources since each book will have its own navigation template?  

::Then on the cover page, there is a picture with its credit below.  Of course it's licensing is correct - public domain, cc, or gnu, etc.  The purpose of it is to provide an appealing cover picture like you have in real books.  But is it a waste of space? 

::The table of contents follows a pattern:

::1. Acknowledgements Image:00%.png
::2. Introduction Image:00%.png
::3. chapter Image:00%.png
:::1. section
:::2. section
::4. chapter Image:00%.png
:::1. section
:::2. section
:::3. section
   
:::  ...

::30. Conclusion Image:00%.png
::31. References Image:00%.png
::32. Index Image:00%.png
::33. Glossary Image:00%
::34. Appendix A - appendix Image:00%.png
::35. Appendix B - appendix Image:00%.png
::36. Appendix C - appendix Image:00%.png
::37. Appendix D - appendix Image:00%.png

::External links and resources

::Indirectly I was fishing for some constructive criticism that would help me answer a few questions 1) I believe there is benefit in not numbering the chapter and section file names so that one can insert a chapter between two existing chapters or sections.  Is there a reason why some people prefer to do it in a rigid matter by including numbers in the chapter and section names? 2) I believe there is a need for all the references in the book to be together in a reference chapter so that they can be referred to within the whole book rather than in one chapter or section at a time, but wikibooks seem to force you into the footnote style with the available tools.  Are there tools to collect references into one chapter?  3) I believe an Index is a good thing so that a user can find a section from a list of topics.  Are there tools that can help build an index?  It's nice to hyperlink the online version, but how do we reference from a key term to a module number inside the book? 4) I believe a glossary is great for people to understand unfamiliar terms.  If the book is printed out, hyperlinks can't be counted on.  But nevertheless, there should be a table of acronyms and common terms to define them in the context of this book.  5) Is there a page that has all the copyright/copyleft that creates a chapter within a book so that when it's printed out, it's part of the book? 6) Is there a way to letter chapters instead of numbering them with the # sign.  My appendix names include the alphabet letter, which keeps me from re-ordering them later.[[User:Kgrr|Kgrr]] 16:33, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

'''Replies:'''
:1) Some people like numbers for the chapters, others don't (I don't use them in the garden book, for example). It's just a matter of personal preference. 
:2) I'm not sure about this, but you might be able to do that in the print version page (I'll play around with that and see). 
:3) Unfortunately indexing probably needs to be done by hand, though someone might have a bot for it. I'll ask on de.wikibooks, but if not, try asking either [[User:Darklama]], [[User:Whiteknight]], or [[User:Derbeth]]... they're our local bot experts. 
:4) I started making one for the garden book that's linkable using # in the wikilink: [[A Wikimanual of Gardening/Glossary]] (look in the edit window). 
:5) yup. When you make the print version, use [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License|WB:GFDL]] as the last page.
:6) Not as far as I know.

== Video Game Wikibooks ==

Your comments on the Administrator's notice board are starting to get substantially off topic, but there are a few points I would like to note here:

Most important, I completely agree that if the WMF wants to step in and regulate the content of Wikibooks, that one way or another it has to happen.  But I would also like to point out the extreme reluctance on the part of the board to get involved with what are ultimately individual project matters which govern content.  About the only major policies they are interested in enforcing are the NPOV and original research policies.  Fair use may be something they may deal with in the near future, but nothing has as of yet been formally approved, and the board member who did speak up only mentioned some potential directions that many board members were thinking about.

Certainly the video game books never, ever, got to that level of discussion by the board, and even Jimbo himself said this is something that needed to reach local community concensus.  He just wanted to prod the community into thinking that perhaps we had been a bit too permissive in allowing certain kinds of content he didn't think needed to be here.  See [[Wikibooks talk:Votes for deletion#A quick review]] for some of his thoughts along those lines.

I have never been happy with the video game books being removed from Wikibooks and have been very vocal about that both when it happened in earnest and even when Jimbo brought the subject up in the first place.  That there certainly were some problems both in terms of potential fair use content violations and becoming macropedias was also significant, not to mention any relevance to the educational mission of Wikibooks that might make removing many of those video game book a near no-brainer.  But those were not the reasons given for their deletion, was it?

Invoking authority of the WMF board when such authority was never granted is mainly what I'm fighting here.  And people raising the StrategyWiki to the status of a Wikibooks sister project.  I suppose that last point is something that perhaps could have some other widespread support, but it would have to be some substantial community concensus, and something I believe would get strong negative attention from the WMF board as well.  Wikibooks were deleted without even so much as a VfD happening (although it is happening now).  Perhaps I could have been a bigger PITA and agressively undeleted the books when I objected, but that would have brought about other problems.

As for the rest of my comments about the video game books, [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge/Archive 18#Wikibooks is not a depository for video game manuals|what I said here]] is still just as relevant as when I wrote the replies in the first place.  And mind you, I wasn't the only person who didn't think this was the right thing to do.  And Jimbo didn't issue &quot;orders&quot; to remove this content, nor did he even do any deletion (on these books).  Unfortunately my comments have been mangled up in the discussion, so it is sometimes a bit hard to follow what I had originally posted.

As for the tax exempt status being an issue for Wikibooks at all, [[Wikibooks talk:What is Wikibooks#Referencing tax-exempt status|I said my fill here on the subject]].

I know that at least in the near term (over the next couple of years, at least), video game books like we had here simply won't be coming back.  But I do object strongly to the idea that any book about video games as a topic is inappropriate for Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:54, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

:I was perfectly on topic, as I was trying to answer a new user's question (which became much more complicated by your lengthy comments). My understanding is that the VG books were not looked upon favorably by the foundation, and yes, the problem was with questionable fair use aspects and their incompatability with our educational mission. The active VGB writers moved their projects to StrategyWiki, and the other VGBs  were subsequently abandoned. I don't think there's been anyone actively hunting them down, except perhaps by those at SW who want to work on them and are more comfortable working there than here. With that trend in mind, we've generally just deleted them after making sure they were properly copied over.

::All I'm asking is that you be clear and not to insinuate any other things, you are free to make your own personal interpretations as am I. I can point to the same problem in yourself so as to be fair you should only state the issues I have addressed, failing to do so would bring me to state the same in such a public forum that would serve no one. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:53, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

== Things and stuff ==

I read a great article the other day about a webmaster (back in the late 80's with the dawn of the internet) who ran a discussion board about the Bosnia crisis. Back in those times the notion of a &quot;troll&quot; was basically unheard of, and no defenses to them were ever erected. In short, everybody on the internet expected everybody else to rise to the same level of respect.

When a troll did appear on the message board, the entire community was brought to a virtual standstill. New posts stopped being created, and users stopped logging in. By the time the troll was finally banned from the website, the message board was almost completely dead. It was, to say the least, a very interesting read. 

I've been so busy recently with school work (especially my ever-growing thesis work) that I haven't been able to make more then a handful of contributions each day. Unfortunately, the majority of those contributions are made in places that aren't textbook pages. I am looking to the horizon when the school semester ends, and I have the freedom of summer to contribute like a mad man again. Even if i devote 10 posts per day to dealing with trolls, that will be a small percentage of all my contributions in a single day. 

I'm sorry we keep missing each other on IRC, i've been working late nights and tend not to get online until 8 or 9. Tonight will be no different, and then i'm gone for the weekend. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[user:Whiteknight/Book Foundry|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:54, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

:Sorry about the call, i got cut off when i went into that tunnel. I dont think i need to &quot;hand the reins back&quot; because i'm not certain at this point that any one person needs to take control of the situation. Doing so will cause that one unfortunate person to deal with this problem and not contribute enough to anything else (which is a fate worse then perma-ban). 
:I'll see what i can jot down concerning that policy, i dont know what kind of time i will have before next week. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[user:Whiteknight/Book Foundry|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">While we try to be as complete, accurate, clear, concise, and transparent as possible, the makers of this Wiki aren't perfect, so you'll probably run into a situation where the information we've given you isn't explicit enough, doesn't cover your situation, or simply isn't right.  In that case, you'll need somewhere to turn for help.

You can start with the &quot;discussion&quot; button at the top of each wiki page, and post your question there (Note: Always use the page's discussion page, never post a question directly on the page you've got a question about; it makes the page harder to read for other people who are trying to read).

If that doesn't cut it, your next stop should be the Python.org [http://www.python.org/community/ Community Page], which contains every form of help you might need: [http://www.python.org/doc/ documentation]. [http://www.python.org/community/lists/ mailing lists], an [http://www.python.org/community/irc/ irc channel], another [http://wiki.python.org/moin/ wiki], and many other forms of support.  Before posting your question however, you may find it useful to read up on [[etiquette]] and [http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html how to ask questions intelligently] (or the [http://www.wikihow.com/Ask-a-Question-Intelligently abbreviated version]).

Remember, no matter what your question is, there are plenty of places to go and people to ask for help.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Gothic}}
=== The Strong Word and the Weak Word ===
One of the bigger things you will have to wrap your head around is that Gothic differentiates between a &quot;strong&quot; word, a &quot;weak&quot; word, and has an &quot;other&quot; category. What does this all mean? A word which is in '''strong form''' is a word that will have a vowel changed to move it into another tense. A word which is in '''weak form''' will have its ending changed in order to demonstrate its tense, or timing. '''Other forms''' will experience a different change when using words. In Gothic, the verb(or action word) would be in strong form or weak form depending on which noun(a person, place or thing) is used.

Note that the Germanic Strength of a word is different from another term of grammar which is related to how a word will be pronnounced in a sentence.</text>

[[Image:Tempe mendoan fried tempeh.jpg|right|thumb|Tempe Mendoan]]

'''Tempe Mendoan''' is a kind of tempeh cooking that is made from thin tempeh, fried with flour so as to taste deliciously piquant. Traditionally in the Banyumas territory, tempe mendoan was made from thin, wide tempeh, one or two sheets cooked at a time. However, tempe mendoan also could be made from normal tempeh that was sliced very thin but wide.

==Ingredients==
* 300 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]] [[Cookbook:Tempeh|tempeh]], size 10&amp;times;15 cm
* 2 pieces [[Cookbook:Green onion|green onion]], slice thinly
* 199 g [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|rice flour]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Flour#Wheat Flour|wheat flour]]
* 125 [[Cookbook:mL|ml]] [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* ½ ml [[Cookbook:Oil|cooking oil]]

===For grinding===
* 2 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 piece [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]]. [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]]
* ¼ tsp. [[Cookbook:Pepper|white pepper]]
* 2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==
# Mix well: the two kinds of flour, all ground ingredients, water, and green onion, mix well into a liquid dough.
# Dip each piece of tempeh into the liquid dough until all surfaces are covered
# Warm the oil in a frying pan, and put it on the stove until hot. Put each piece of coated tempeh into hot oil.
# [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|Fry]] the tempehs, and wait until it becomes hardened and well done.  Please don't wait until it becomes yellow and crispy.  Take out the tempeh from the warm oil. Let the oil drip from the tempeh so that there is not much oil on it.
# Served tempeh with [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy bean sauce]] and sliced small [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilies]].

Serves 12.

==Variation==

===Ingredients===
* 250 g [[Cookbook:Tempeh|tempeh]], sliced into pieces 10&amp;times;6&amp;times;1 cm
* 75 g [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|rice flour]]
* 25 g [[Cookbook:Tapioca Starch|tapioca starch]]
* 3 pieces [[Cookbook:Green onion|green onion]]
* 125 ml [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

===For grinding===
* 2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]]
* 1 piece [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 cm greater [[Cookbook:Galangal|galingale]]
* add salt according to taste

===Procedure===

# Put together the two kinds of flour and the ground ingredients.
# Add water little by little until it forms a liquid dough. Mix together until it forms a smooth and complete mix.
# Add the sliced green onion.
# Warm the cooking oil in the frying pan.
# Dip the tempeh into the dough.
# Insert the tempeh into the hot oil, and fry it until done.
# Take it out from the oil and serve it with small chilies.

I see that the Indonesian recipe book doesn't have a recipe for tempe! You might want to pinch [[Cookbook:Tempeh|this one]] and translate it :) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:21, 5 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

In biology, ''evolution'' can be defined as &quot;descent with modification.&quot;  This means that evolution CANNOT occur at the individual level.  Rather, evolution is a change in the gene pool over time.

All living things (bacteria, animals, plants, etc.) are designed to reproduce.  This is because all of their ancestors successfully reproduced.  Those species who fail to reproduce will die out, or go extinct.

All living things on earth are related to one another and have a common ancestor that lived about 4 billion years ago.

'''&lt;u&gt;Mechanisms of Evolution&lt;/u&gt;'''

a) ''Natural Selection'' - Natural selection is a mechanism of evolution that occurs when the natural environment selects ''for'' or ''against'' a particular trait.  This selective pressure (or selective force) causes certain alleles to become more common in the population.  

Natural selection occurs to organisms when the environment around them changes.  Those individuals best suited to the new environment survive and reproduce (more often) and pass their characteristics on to the next generation.  Those individuals less suited to the new environment die and/or fail to reproduce (or they do it less often); these &quot;poor&quot; characteristics get weeded out of the population.  Their allele frequency decreases.

An '''adaptation''' is a characteristic that arises due to natural selection that allows an organism to better live, survive, and reproduce in a new environment.  (A '''preadaptation''' is a feature that an organism has evolved that accidentally becomes useful at doing something else.)

'''&lt;u&gt;Speciation&lt;/u&gt;'''

a) '''Speciation''' (the creation of a new species) usually occurs when a small group of individuals becomes geographically isolated from the main population, and inbreeding occurs. 

{{Example|A few finches (a type of bird) are blown by a storm from the coast of South America to the Galapagos Islands.  Their old food, seeds and nuts, is no longer available to them, but there are plenty of insects.  The bills of these birds ''adapt'' to the new environment by becoming more capable of catching insects (likely long and/or skinny beaks).  This new long, skinny-billed finch will be a different species.}}

b) A BIT MORE DETAIL

If two populations of a given species are separated for a long enough period of time (often this means millions of years), the two separate gene pools will slowly accumulate mutations that they don’t share with each other because these two populations are not breeding with each other.  '''Mutations''' change not just the sequence of nitrogen bases within the DNA (genes), but also the sequence of amino acids within the polypeptides that those genes code for, which, in turn, alter the shape of the proteins that those polypeptides are contained within.  Proteins must be shaped just right in order to work correctly, because all proteins grab onto something.  

If an organism’s proteins aren’t shaped right and can’t grab onto their specific molecules when they’re supposed to, then all manner of structural and chemical problems will arise within the cells of the embryo and it may die.  If these two populations are reproductively isolated for long enough, they will evolve into different species, because their proteins are no longer compatible with each other.  This sequence of events is called '''speciation'''.

The mutations that spread through each gene pool by the reproduction of successive generations often aren’t random; natural selection favors the mutations that better allow an individual organism to reproduce and leave behind more children; these mutations spread rapidly through the gene pool over the course of a few generations.  Because separated populations are often exposed to different environmental conditions (habitats), they are also exposed to different selective pressures, and natural selection will act on each population differently.  This encourages genetic divergence and speciation.

c) '''Allopatric speciation''' - occurs when a population becomes geographically divided.  
   

d) '''Sympatric speciation''' - occurs within the geographical range occupied by both the parent species and the new species.  This usually occurs in animals due to a ''niche shift'': a few members of a species start exploiting a new habitat or resource, or are active at a different time of day (i.e., becoming nocturnal instead of diurnal).

{{Example|After the 1st 100 generations of Galapagos finches listed above have come and gone, the next 100 generations sees the radiation and diversification of many different Galapagos finch species: some finches evolve bills for eating cacti, some evolve bills for grasping cactus spines with which they chisel bark away like woodpeckers while looking for ants, others evolve fruit-eating bills, others insect-eating bills, still others seed-and-nut-eating bills.}}

e) A '''species''' may be divided into two or more '''subspecies.''' These are populations that are ''on their way'' to becoming two different species.  At the moment, though, members of both populations can still produce viable offspring together - though they don't usually mate with each other due to some '''reproductive barrier.''' Two different subspecies often look similar to one another in body form, but their ''size'' and ''coloration'' is often different.  Two subspecies tend to live in two different geographical ranges, which may or may not overlap.  


'''&lt;u&gt;Reproductive Isolation&lt;/u&gt;'''

''Two Categories of Reproductive Barriers''

&lt;u&gt;Pre-Zygotic Barriers&lt;/u&gt;

a) '''Behavioral isolation''' - Two subspecies no longer find each other sexually attractive and therefore hardly ever mate with each other anymore.

b) '''Mechanical Isolation''' - The two subspecies' genitals have changed shape enough that they don't physically fit together anymore.

c) '''Habitat Isolation''' - For example, this occurs when one subspecies of bird has begun foraging on the ground, while the other continues to forage at the tops of trees.

d) '''Gametic Isolation''' - The two subspecies' sperm and egg can't fuse together anymore, because their surface proteins have changed shape enough that they can no longer bind together; the sperm cell can't &quot;grab&quot; the egg cell.

e) '''Temporal Isolation''' - One subspecies is more active during the day, the other at night; since they're not active at the same time of day ''together,'' they never mate (it's hard to mate when one of the two mating partners is asleep).

f) '''Geographical Isolation''' - The two subspecies don't live in the same geographical region; they never meet, so they never mate.

&lt;u&gt;Post-Zygotic Barriers&lt;/u&gt;

a) '''Reduced Hybrid Variability''' - Hybrids have detrimental physical characteristics that make them more susceptible to predators, parasites, or diseases and/or makes them less capable of finding food or shelter.

b) '''Reduced Hybrid Fertility''' - Hybrids between the two species/subspecies are sterile or are completely sexually unattractive to members of ''either'' species/subspecies.
{{Example|Frog calls sung at wrong pitch; bird songs sung wrong; bird plumage the wrong colors or patterns}}

==Coevolution and Convergent Evolution==

a) '''Coevolution''' occurs when the evolution of one species affects the evolution of another.
{{Example|Lions get faster, so gazelles get faster.}}

b) '''Convergent Evolution''' occurs when two similar (yet independent) environments select for similar characteristics in two unrelated species. 
{{Example|Cacti species that belong to different plant species}}

==Types of Selection==

'''&lt;u&gt;Sexual Selection&lt;/u&gt;'''

a) Males of a species are '''polygamous''' when they are not needed to help raise the children.  Ex: dogs, most insects, etc.

b) Males of a species are '''monogamous''' when they are needed to help raise the children.  Ex: humans, seahorses, songbirds, etc.

'''Sexual Selection''' -- males and females of a species evolve somewhat independently of each other.  Selective forces favor the individuals of both sexes who leave behind the most offspring.  Oftentimes, this means that the two sexes will have different reproductive strategies.


'''&lt;u&gt;Stabilizing Selection&lt;/u&gt;'''

In this type of natural selection, individuals with extreme or unusual traits are selected ''against.''  For example, in humans, alleles for extremely tall or short height are selected against.

'''&lt;u&gt;Directional Selection&lt;/u&gt;'''

In this type of natural selection, individuals at one end of a range are selected ''for.''  For example, dark-colored moths are selected for, because they are more easily camouflaged, survive longer, and leave behind more offspring.

'''&lt;u&gt;Disruptive Selection&lt;/u&gt;'''

In this type of natural selection, extreme and/or unusual traits are selected ''for.''  Common traits are selected ''against.''

'''&lt;u&gt;Selective Breeding (Artificial Selection)&lt;/u&gt;'''

This is NOT a type of natural selection, because it is done by humans.  In this type of selection, humans select for or against the most desirable traits in plants and animals.  For example, they may  breed the least aggressive dogs to produce fewer aggressive dogs in the next generation.

Science explores into the actuality of forms and phenomena. All the branches of science are the various ways to realize the truth of existence. The approach of each of them starts from the obvious known and aims at investigating the hidden unknown. The ultimate truth of life is being approached from all directions. All the sciences are exploring the various strata of creation, from the gross to the subtler fields of existence.

The Science of Being, as does every other science, starts its investigation into the truth of existence from the gross, obvious level of life and later enters into the subtle regions of experience. The Science of Being, however, eventually transcends these subtle regions and arrives at the direct experience of the transcendental field of eternal Being.

The Science of Being is a deep and practical philosophy of life. It is a systematic investigation into the true nature of the ultimate reality. Although, like any other science, it is theoretical in its nature, its applied aspects reach much farther horizons of the supreme reality of life than those of abstract metaphysical speculations.

This book is divided into four sections: “Science of Being”; “Life”; “Art of Living”; and “Fulfillment.” The last three sections of the book present the most practical wisdom of day-to-day life, and this greatest wisdom of practical life is based on the deep philosophical significance contained in the section on the Science of Being.

To those who have never had an interest in metaphysical study, the section on “Science of Being” may at first appear to be highly abstract, but once they have stepped into “Life” and “Art of Living” and have completed the section on “Fulfillment,” they will find that without dwelling on the abstract features of the Science of Being, the whole wisdom of the book would have no practical basis.

Likewise, a man in the practical field of life must first be given a good understanding about the fundamental reality of life that lies in the field of abstract Being, in order to glorify the whole of the rest of life. That is why the Science of Being is the first section of this book, and the sections of practical value follow.

The field of Being or absolute existence was for many centuries considered in terms of mysticism. The present scientific age hesitates to assign value to anything shrouded in the garb of mysticism, and that is why the study of Being, the absolute field of creation, has not been a part of any branch of science until now.

A systematic method has been developed that enables an individual to experience directly the pure state of Being. It is done by consciously entering into the experience of the subtle strata of a thought, eventually arriving at the direct experience of the subtlest state of the thought, and then arriving at the very source of thought. Then the conscious mind attains the pure state of Being.

The Science of Being, which gives rise to the practical art of living, is a science which is much more valuable for human life than all the sciences known so far to the human mind. For, up to now, the basis of all the sciences has been the human mind functioning from a limited field of consciousness or limited potential. The Science of Being, through the practice of Transcendental Meditation, enlarges the conscious capacity of the mind to infinite values and therefore functions not only as the basis for the great expansion of knowledge in every field of science, but also brings to man a direct way to fulfillment.

My thanks are also due to blessed Ma from London, who, like a mother, sat with a stick over the child to get the task completed. Leona Simpson from Canada, Guri Mehellis from Norway, and Dick Bock from Los Angeles, have also been of great assistance in maintaining the breath of the writing and the writer. Jerry Jarvis and his dear wife Debby, who worked hard transcribing and editing the tapes and preparing the final manuscript, also deserve to share my feelings of appreciation and thanks for them. Certainly the warmth of the atmosphere created by love of Mother Olson and Roland Olson, Helen Lutes, and the dear Verrills and Granvilles had its own share in bringing out this book.

This is a book of revival for the age. If the golden era is ever to dawn on human society, if the Age of Enlightenment is ever to be on earth, this book will provide a freeway for it to come. A new humanity will be born, fuller in conception and richer in experience and accomplishments in all fields. Joy of life will belong to every man, love will dominate human society, truth and virtue will reign in the world, peace on earth will be permanent, and all will live in fulfillment in fullness of life in God Consciousness.

'''''Risotto''''' is an Italian rice dish, most popular in northern Italy. Traditionally, ''risotto'' is the name given to all recipes that use rice as the main component and are served as first dish in a traditional Italian lunch or dinner as usually pasta also is. When rice arrived in Italy six centuries ago from the Far East, it found an ideal place for cultivation in the Po river plain and during the Renaissance and gradually replaced rye, barley and millet for its ease of preparation and nutritious power. Its diffusion across the country gave rise to hundreds of recipes which contain components of different local cultures. But the founder of all ''risotti'' is the Milan ''risotto'', also called saffron ''risotto''.

Generally the rice is slowly cooked in stock, but other liquids can be used. What's described here is a basic ''risotto'' recipe. Grated or ground parmesan cheese is almost always sprinkled on top. It can be eaten as is, but risotto is generally enjoyed with one or two ingredients added. In Italy, ''risotto'' is, like pasta, usually served as first course, the second course being meat or fish.
{{wikipedia|Risotto}}
==Ingredients==
* 400 grams (14 ounces) ''risotto'' [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] (plump, medium grain rice that contains a lot of starch, the types Maratelli, Arborio, Carnaroli or Vialone Nano are traditionally best)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 1 glass of dry white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
* 25 grams (1 ounce) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (a good rich butter is best)
* about a liter of [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]]/[[Cookbook:Broth|broth]], but it's a good idea to have more than you need (as the amount needed is difficult to predict). What type of stock depends on the flavour you're trying to achieve, but since the flavour of the stock will become the main flavour of the dish, good stock is a wise investment. Canned is better than cubes or powder, home-made is usually best. Make sure the stock isn't too strong or too salty, as it will be greatly condensed. Make sure the stock is clear too, or the texture of the risotto will become gritty (The article on stock contains information on clarifying stock).

==Preparation==
Make sure your stock is simmering before you begin. It's important that the temperature is as high as possible, without letting the stock boil. The surface of the stock should just be moving a little. 
A large thick pot is best for the ''risotto''.

# Finely chop the onion and sweat it very gently (cook over medium heat, without letting it brown) in some butter or olive oil. This is known as a ''[[w:Soffritto|soffritto]]'' in Italy.
# Add the rice and cook until it has a transparent look (this shouldn't take long). Add some salt and pepper.
# Add the wine. A hot pan will cause the alcohol to evaporate more quickly (and create a nice dramatic effect), but make sure you don't burn the rice or the ''soffritto''.
# As the wine cooks away you will see the remaining liquid getting thicker as it's absorbing the starch from the rice. When it’s more or less gone, add some stock. Do not add too much stock. The rice should never be submerged in stock. Keep stirring it and keep adding more stock as it cooks away. This should take about 15 to 20 minutes.
# Taste to see if the rice is done. The rice should be soft, but have enough bite to it to feel the individual grains of rice. The choice between a liquid ''risotto'' or a firmer one is a matter of personal preference. 

When put on a plate, it should spread out slowly. If it sits still, it needs some more stock; if there's liquid coming from the ''risotto'', it needs to cook down a bit more.
# Let it rest for about a minute
# Vigorously stir in the butter in small chunks at the time, taste to get the amount of butter right. Season with more salt and pepper to taste. This phase is called the ''mantecatura''.
# Serve immediately. Risotto won't keep beyond the meal, but rehydrating it with some soup or stock can yield edible results.

With ''risotto'', practice makes perfect because there are many factors that influence the outcome.  Experiment with several varieties of rice, choose the one you like best and then fine-tune the various parameters like cooking temperature, selection of the proper pot, the amount and timing of seasonings etc.

==Notes, tips and variations==
===Notes===
* This is only the most basic risotto recipe. Add ingredients only at the beginning (through the soffritto, when they need to cook with the rice) or at the very end in the mantecura (for ingredients that lose their flavour with too much cooking, such as [[Cookbook:Herb|herbs]]). If you want to use ingredients that require a very specific cooking time, like [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] or [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]], it's best to [[Cookbook Blanching|blanch]] them in advance, and add them to the risotto at the very end. It's very difficult to add them to the ''risotto'' halfway so that they will be cooked perfectly when the ''risotto'' is done. If you want the flavour of the stock to be present in these ingredients, blanch them in the stock. For some ingredients, like [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], the cooking time isn't extremely important. These can simply be added to the risotto somewhere along the line.
* A common mistake in making ''risotto'' is to add too much of the extra ingredients. The star of the dish is the rice, and only very little else is needed.
* Ingredients added at the last moment will be laced with butter. This can have a negative impact on the effect of some delicate ingredients, like garden cress.

===Tips===
* Think of ''risotto'' as a way of making stock edible with a fork: the quality of the stock you use is the most important factor in the quality of your ''risotto''.
* Use a different type of liquor to replace the white wine; vodka, whiskey, champagne and martini work well. Keep in mind that the color of the liquor will affect the rice. Using [[Cookbook:Red Wine|red wine]] will create a red risotto (which looks nice with [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] or [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]). [[Cookbook:Rosé|Rosé]] wine will make a pink/purple ''risotto'', which looks nice with asparagus. 
* [[Cookbook:Saffron|Saffron]] added to the stock is ''risotto alla Milanese''. 
* Using large roasted  breadcrumbs instead of parmesan cheese will create a nice contrast in texture with the ''risotto''. Put the breadcrumbs on top of the ''risotto'' at the last minute and don't stir, or they will soak up too much moisture and lose their crunch. 
* After step 3 you can move the contents into a rice cooker with the stock and left to its own devices to finish it off. The end result isn't quite as good, but the saving in effort makes it worthwhile. 
* Left over ''risotto'' is not particularly nice reheated on its own. So as not to waste the leftovers, you can form day old ''risotto'' into cakes or patties, coat them in flour and shallow fry them in olive oil, making risotto cakes. This can be served with a salad.

===A very quick ''risotto'' with parboiled rice===
When really pressed for time, the following procedure will produce a reasonable semblance of ''risotto'' within ten minutes:
*Place a pot over strong heat and pour in the stock to boil.  You will need twice as much stock as the rice to be cooked (e.g. two cups of stock for one cup of dry rice).  
*Place a second pot over strong heat and drop in some butter.
*Once the butter in the first pot has melted, pour in the rice and start sautéing it, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon.  The butter will soon start to froth.  Extra seasonings can also be added at this point.
*By this time, the stock will have started boiling.  Pour it into the pot with the rice (caution: this produces hot steam suddenly), stir well to make sure that no rice has stuck on the inside of the pot, cover the pot and switch off the heat.
*Leave alone for five to seven minutes, then serve.

===Variations===
* [[Cookbook:Mushroom|Mushroom]] ''risotto''. Add mushrooms to the ''soffritto''.
* [[Cookbook:Cashew|Cashew]] nut and [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]] ''risotto''. Add chopped cucumber and roasted (unsalted) cashew nuts. 
* [[Cookbook:Feta Cheese|Feta cheese]] and [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]] ''risotto''. Add the rosemary to the ''soffritto'' and stir small chunks of the feta cheese through the ''risotto'' at the end. Use roasted breadcrumbs instead of parmesan cheese.
* [[Cookbook:Paella|Paella]] is similar to a ''risotto'', but uses a very different cooking method.
* Add sliced [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], sliced sun-dried tomatoes and shredded [[Cookbook:Pepperoni|pepperoni]] before adding the wine.  Add tin of [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]] just before it finishes, or fresh asparagus stalks just before the wine.
* Sweet pea risotto: add sweet peas about 10 minutes before mantecatura.

[[Image:Pressure cooker.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''Pressure cooking''' is a method of cooking in which the [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] temperature of water is increased using a special vessel, causing the food to cook faster. Cooking times can be reduced by a factor of three or four. For example, shredded [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] is cooked in one minute, fresh [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green beans]] take about five, small to medium-sized [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] (up to 200&amp;nbsp;g) may be ready in five minutes or so and a whole [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] takes no more than twenty-five minutes. It is often used to simulate the effects of long [[Cookbook:Braising|braising]] or [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmering]] in shorter periods of time.

This is accomplished using a '''pressure cooker''', a sealed vessel that does not permit steam to escape until a preset pressure is achieved. Because water's boiling point increases as the pressure increases, the pressure built up inside the cooker allows the liquid in the pot to rise to a temperature higher than 100&amp;nbsp;°C (212&amp;nbsp;°F) before boiling. A safety valve releases steam when the pressure exceeds the safety limit for the cooker; usually the steam pressure lifts a weighted stopper allowing excess pressure to escape.  There is usually a backup pressure release mechanism, in the form of a hole in the lid blocked by a plug of low melting-point alloy, a rubber seal and pin, or a rubber ring seal. If internal temperature (and hence pressure) gets too high, the release mechanism will trigger, resulting in a release of the pressure.  However, it is best not to rely on this feature.

A pressure cooker can be used at high altitude to compensate for lower atmospheric pressure. Without it, water boils off before reaching 100&amp;nbsp;°C, lengthening the cooking time for recipes.

In some countries, the [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave]] has replaced the pressure cooker as a technical fix for faster cooking.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Soft boiled eggs''', a nice way to eat poached eggs without a plate, takes about 7 minutes to prepare.  Often served with buttered toast, perfect for dipping into the runny yolk.

==Ingredients==
*2 or 3 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], depending on appetite
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

==Equipment==
*A small [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] (1 - 2 [[Cookbook:Quart|quarts]] / [[Cookbook:Liter|litres]])
*A small spoon or [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]]
*Gas or electric stove, at medium-high to high heat
*A sharp pin or tack (optional - see method 2)
*A [[Cookbook:Slotted Spoon|slotted spoon]] (optional - see method 2)

==Procedure==

There are several popular ways to make soft boiled eggs. Here are the most common ones.

===Method 1===
This is a method used widely in France that almost invariably leaves the yolk soft and runny but not watery. This method still requires that you pierce the shell.

#Using eggs which are more or less at room temperature (i.e., not straight from the refrigerator), place in water that has been brought to a &quot;furious&quot; boil. 
# After one minute, remove from heat and allow eggs to stand in the hot water in the pan for 5 minutes.

===Method 2===
#Fill the pot ¾ full with water and set on stove top to boil.
#Using the pin, poke a small hole on the larger end of the egg. 
#When the water is boiling, use the slotted spoon to lower the eggs into the pot. 
#Let the eggs boil for 4-6 minutes (5 minutes for soft yolk, 4 minutes for runny).
#Remove the eggs with the slotted spoon.

===Method 3===
#Mix ½ tsp salt into enough water to cover your eggs, and bring the water to a soft boil.
#Put your eggs in the water and boil for 4-5 minutes.
#When they're done, immediately run them under cold water so they stop cooking.

===Method 4===
# Bring water to a rolling boil
#Put eggs in water
#Remove from heat, cover pot.
#Let Sit for 8 minutes

===Method 5===
#add 1/2 tsp of salt in cold water
#boil 6 eggs in water for 6 mins (1 min per egg)
#remove from heat, cover pot
#let it sit for 3-5 minutes then serve, but
#put them in cold water before serving will make the task of taking egg shells off easy

===Method 6===
This method uses steam to cook the whites firmly while still maintaining a perfectly cooked, runny yolk. It produces consistent results every time.
#Bring about 1 inch of water to a rolling boil in a pot. You want just enough water to create steam &amp; not evaporate.
#Add eggs very carefully, with a long spoon if necessary. Beware... Steam is hot!
#Cover with a lid and let boil/steam for 6 to 6 1/2 minutes, depending on how runny you want the yolks.
#Immediately remove pot from heat, drain hot water &amp; rinse eggs under cold water for about 30 seconds. Ready to serve.

==Serving==
[[File:Eggcup.jpg|thumb|upright|Serve soft-boiled eggs in an upright stand, ideally an egg cup, so that the interior does not leak out.]]
#To serve, place eggs on an egg cup, shot glass, or anything that will allow the egg to stay upright.
#Using the small spoon, repeatedly tap the top of the eggs until an area the size of the spoon is cracked
#Dig the spoon across the bottom of the cracked area to remove the top.
#Use the spoon to eat from the egg shell and/or cut toast into strips and dip into the egg.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Solving Inequalities involving Fractions===
I think there is error in this section (i.e. &quot;Solving Inequalities involving Fractions&quot;). It says:

&quot;Step 1:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x+1}-\frac{5-x}{x+1}\le 0&lt;/math&gt; then simplified it becomes &lt;math&gt;\frac{x-5}{x+1}\le0&lt;/math&gt;&quot;

but shouldn't this be:

&quot;Step 1:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x+1}-\frac{5-x}{x+1}\le 0&lt;/math&gt; then simplified it becomes &lt;math&gt;\frac{x-4}{x+1}\le0&lt;/math&gt;&quot;

? The rest of the example has to be corrected, too, of course... 


[[User:83.238.180.4|83.238.180.4]] 14:38, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

I agree there is an error - which can be proved. Put in x= 5 (one of the solutions listed) and the inequality becomes 1/6 &lt;= 0/6 which is false !

However - why didn't you fix it when you found it? --[[User:Blinford|Benny]] 18:11, 11 September 2007 (UTC)

In the end I changed the example so that the images were correct [[User:Blinford|Benny]] 18:40, 11 September 2007 (UTC)


Actually there is an error in the interval notation also [[User:Blinford|Benny]] 18:43, 11 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

Advanced Placement exams are created and administered by the College Board, The same organization that does SATs. The AP exam tests your knowledge of a specific subject at the college level. It is scored from one to five, with three usually being the minimum to get college credit. The tests are taken in May, and the scores usually arrive by July.

It is not necessary to take an AP class to take that exam, and vice versa. However, it is a good idea to do so.

Unlike the SAT, AP exams contain open-ended questions in conjunction with multiple choice questions. Before the May 2011 AP exams, points were taken off for incorrect multiple choice answers, but this is no longer done.

The AP Chemistry exam contains two sections.
# A 75 question multiple-choice section that is 90 minutes long.
# An open ended section with six questions. This section is 95 minutes long, and is worth 75 points. It includes two parts (A and B). Part A is 55 minutes long and allows a calculator. It includes 3 questions. Part B is 40 minutes long, includes 3 questions, and does not allow a calculator. Students are allowed to work again on part A if they finish part B early, but they are not allowed to regain access to calculators.

In general, this is how the base score is converted into the final score:
:101-150 - 5
:81-100 - 4
:61-80 - 3
:41-60 - 2
:0-40 - 1

===What Should I Bring?===
Pencils, pens, erasers, calculator, watch that doesn't beep, snacks, water, and tissues. As is with all AP exams, '''LEAVE YOUR CELL PHONE AT HOME OR IN CAR'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You should remember everything here from your high-school level chemistry class.

==Units and Measurement==
*Fahrenheit is not used on the AP exam. Celsius (&amp;deg;C) and Kelvin (K) are used. Pure water freezes at 0&amp;deg; Celsius (273K) and boils at 100&amp;deg;C (373K).

===Significant Figures===
*Digits 1 through 9 are significant, and so are zeroes in between them. For example, the number 209 has three significant figures.
*Zeroes to the right of all other digits are only significant if there is a decimal point written. 290 has 2 sig figs, 290. has three, and 290.0 has four.

====Measured vs. Exact Numbers====
Exact numbers are either defined numbers or result from a count. A dozen is defined as 12 objects. A pound is defined as 16 ounces. Measured numbers always have a limited number of significant digits. They are certain up to a limited number of digits. A mass reported as 12 grams is implied to be known to the nearest gram and not to the tenth of a gram.

===The Mole and Avogadro's Number===
12 grams of Carbon-12 contain exactly one mole (6.02 * 10^23) of molecules. This is a measured number known as Avogadro's number. It is easy to convert between atomic mass, grams, and particles using Avogadro's number.

===Multiplying and Significant Figures===
Multiplying &lt;u&gt;measured&lt;/u&gt; numbers in Chemistry is not like multiplying in math. 5 * 92 equals 460 in math class, but it equals 500 in chemistry. This is because the 5 only has one significant figure, so the answer has to be rounded to one sig fig. If 5.0 and 92 were multiplied, on the other hand, the answer would be 460 in both subjects.

===Adding and Significant Figures===
# First, align all the numbers vertically, as if you were going to add them. DO NOT WRITE IN EXTRA ZEROS AS PLACEHOLDERS.
# Add
# Round to the smallest place that contains a digit in every number.

Example: 210 + 370. + 539&lt;code&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;210
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;370.
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;539&lt;br&gt;+----&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;1119 ≈ 1120
&lt;/code&gt;

==States of Matter==
*Solid (s) - definite shape and volume. Vibrates in place, but does not flow.
*Fluids - take the shape of their container.
**Liquid (l) - definite volume
**Gas (g) - variable volume (compressible)

==History of Chemistry==
*Democritus - philosopher who made the idea of atoms.
*Antoine Lavoisier - discovered Law of Conservation of Mass, which states that mass does not appear or disappear in chemical reactions, only rearrange.
*John Dalton - first scientist to scientifically describe atomic theory.
*#Matter is made from indestructible particles called atoms.
*#Atoms of the same element are the same.
*#Compounds are two or more atoms bonded together.
*#Chemical reactions are the rearrangement of atoms.
*J.J. Thomson - discovers the electron.
*Robert Millikan - discovers the mass and charge of electrons.
**&quot;Raisin Pudding model&quot; - atoms are like pudding, with electrons as raisins.
*Ernest Rutherford - through his gold foil experiment, discovers the nucleus. Since most of the alpha particles he shot through the gold were not deflected, he concluded that most of an atom is empty space.

==Modern Atomic Theory==
Atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons weigh approximately 1 AMU, and electrons have a negligible mass. Elements are determined by the number of protons in the atom, known as the ''atomic number''. The number of neutrons varies, creating different ''isotopes'' of different mass. The ''atomic mass'' of an atom is the sum of its protons and neutrons, both of which are found in the nucleus.

==Electrons==
Electrons are arranged into shells that surround the atom. Each shell has 1-4 subshells, which themselves have 1-7 orbitals, each of which holds two electrons.

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
|Shell || Subshell || Orbitals
|-
|1
|s
|1
|-
|2 
|s, p
|1 + 3 = 4
|-
|3
|s, p, d
|1 + 3 + 5 = 9
|-
|4
|s, p, d, f
|1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
|}

===Filling Electron Shells===
*Aufbau principle - fill the lowest energy subshells first, in accordance with the following image:
[[File:Electron_configuration_order.gif]]
*Hund's rule - fill each orbital in a subshell with one electron before putting a second electron in any of those orbitals.

===Writing Electron Configurations===
E.g. sodium = 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

==VSEPR Theory==
Valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory.  Electrons in a compound will try to move as far apart from each other as possible. Bonded pairs repel more strongly than unbonded pairs.

==Hybrid Orbitals==
The moving apart of electron pairs requires the hybridization of orbitals. These hybrids range from sp to sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, having two to six pairs.

==Sigma and Pi Bonds==
*Sigma bond - forms in all compounds
*Pi bonds - one or more are formed per extra electron pair that is shared among two atoms. These bonds are weaker than sigma bonds.

==Resonance==
[[File:Benzene_resonance.png|right]][[File:Benz4.png|right|150px]]Sometimes, there is more than one &quot;correct&quot; way to draw a substance. In reality, the structure of the substance is an average of the drawn variations.

==The Periodic Table==
You should already be familiar with this. Each row is called a period, and each column is a group or family. Nonmetals and metals are separated by a jagged line on the right side. (Hydrogen is also a non-metal). Elements that border the line are called '''metalloids''', and share characteristics with both metals and nonmetals.

{{:General Chemistry/The Quantum Atom}}

==Oxidation Numbers==
Oxidation numbers are a way of keeping track of electrons and making sure that components of a compound match by the correct ratios.
*Pure elements have an oxidation number of zero.
*Ions, monoatomic or polyatomic have oxidation numbers equal to their charge.
*The sum of the oxidation numbers in covalent and ionic compounds must equal zero.
*Bonded Group 1 metals are +1, Group 2 are +2, and halogens are -1, unless bonded with oxygen.
*Bonded oxygen is -2 unless it is in a hydroxide (OH), where it is -1, or with fluorine, where it is positive.
*Bonded hydrogen is -1 when bonded with a metal and +1 when bonded with a nonmetal

==Naming Compounds==

===Binary Compounds===
(First element's name) (Second element's name + ide) e.g. Sodium Chloride.

===Binary Acids===
Hydro(nonmetal+ic) acid. E.g. Hydrobromic acid (HBr)

===Ternary Compounds===
(First element's name) (polyatomic ion's name) e.g. Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH). Note that there is an exception - the ammonium ion (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) can replace the first element.

===Ternary Acids===
In the following order: (hydrogen)(a nonmetal)(oxygen) 

If the ion ends in -ate, the acid will be named (nonmetal)ic acid. Example: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; contains a sulfate ion.  It is called sulfuric acid.

If the ion ends in -ite, the acid is named (nonmetal)ous acid

===Stock System===
Some elements, especially transition metals, can have many oxidation numbers. As a result, the positive oxidation number has to be written in, using Roman numerals. For example, Cu&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is Copper (II) oxide and Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is Copper (I) oxide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Genitive Case ==

There are a variety of uses for the genitive case. One frequent use is to indicate posession. The case marker for the genitive is '''.ak'''. As is typical in Sumerian, this particle is subject to the loss of the final '''-k''' unless succeeded by another particle. For instance, the Sumerian sentence '''lugal Unug.a(k)''' ''= the king of Uruk'', will typically be written without the final '''-k''', but when the phrase is followed by, say, the ergative case marker (which is '''.e'''), we get '''lugal Unug.ak.e'''.

This is very typical in Sumerian. Whenever a word ends in a consonant from a case marker (or other grammatical suffix), that consonant is often dropped. When we add another suffix, though, we restore that consonant before adding our new suffix.

The genitive marker may be repeated if the semantics require. The phrase ''the house of the king of Uruk'' will be written '''e lugal Unug.ak.a(k)''', where we interpret the logical chunking to be '''[e [lugal Unug].ak].a(k)'''.

[Thomsen §161, Edzard §5.4.2.3]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Dative Case ==

Whenever a sentence expresses something being done '''for''' someone, the beneficiary is put in the dative case, by suffixing the dative case particle '''.ir'''. Consider:

'''(1) Nanna.(i)r Šulgi.(e) e.Ø mu.na.(n).du'''
''= For Nanna, Shulgi built the temple''

We see that the temple was built ''for'' Nanna, and hence his name is put in the dative case. As is standard, the initial '''/i/''' sound is often lost when it occurs right after another vowel. (Nanna, incidentally, was the name for the moon god, also called Zuen.)

Also, somewhat mysteriously, the '''/r/''' sound was often not written either! That means we're basically seeing '''Nanna''' but reading '''Nanna.(ir)'''. However, it is often quite easy to tell when this is happening, and the meaning is usually clear whether or not the particle is actually written.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Ergative Case ==

Sumerian, as mentioned before, is a split-ergative language. Ergativity is simply one way in which languages mark certain phrases in a sentence as the subject or object, for instance. In ergative constructions, we usually mark the &quot;agent&quot;, or whoever is ''doing'' the action, differently than the &quot;patient&quot;, namely whoever the action is being done to. An example might be the sentence ''Achilles eluded Paris.'' Here, it is Achilles who is doing the eluding, and is the Agent, and Paris is the Patient -- the one who is being eluded.

Now, not all sentences have a patient. Intransitive sentences (as opposed to the transitive example above) are such constructions, and an example might be ''Socrates slept.'' Here, we only have a Subject, namely Socrates.

The distinguishing feature of ergative languages is that the Patient and Subject are always in the same case (the absolutive) while the Agent gets its own case (the ergative). In Sumerian, the ergative case is denoted by the suffix '''.e'''. In (1) above, notice that '''Šulgi.(e)''' is the Agent of the action (he is building the temple), so we place the ergative suffix after his name. (Again, we see the typical Sumerian habit of dropping a suffixed vowel if it comes right after another vowel.)

The important thing to remember is that in ergative constructions, we mark the Agent of the action by the '''.e''' suffix.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Absolutive Case ==

In light of the discussion above about ergativity, we just need to note that the Patient and Subject of ergative constructions are marked by a suffixed '''.Ø'''. This is the &quot;null&quot; suffix. It means that there is no vocalized marker of the absolutive case. While it might seem silly to attach a &quot;nothing&quot; to words, it is really just an analytical tool so we can clearly delineate which participants in a sentence are performing which tasks.

In (1) above, note that the temple ('''e''') is the thing being built. Hence, it is the Patient of the ergative sentence. So we mark it with the null prefix, and we have '''e.Ø''', signifying that '''e''' is in the absolutive case.

==How fuzzy positions get fuzzier==
We will calculate the rate at which the fuzziness of a position probability distribution increases, in consequence of the fuzziness of the corresponding momentum, when there is no counterbalancing attraction (like that between the nucleus and the electron in atomic hydrogen).

Because it is easy to handle, we choose a Gaussian function
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(0,x)=Ne^{-x^2/2\sigma^2},
&lt;/math&gt;
which has a bell-shaped graph. It defines a position probability distribution
:&lt;math&gt;
|\psi(0,x)|^2=N^2 e^{-x^2/\sigma^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;
If we normalize this distribution so that &lt;math&gt;\int dx\,|\psi(0,x)|^2=1,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;N^2=1/\sigma\sqrt{\pi},&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;
|\psi(0,x)|^2=e^{-x^2/\sigma^2}/\sigma\sqrt{\pi}.
&lt;/math&gt;
We also have that
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta x(0)=\sigma/\sqrt{2},&lt;/math&gt;
*the Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;\psi(0,x)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\overline{\psi}(0,k)=\sqrt{\sigma/\sqrt{\pi}} e^{-\sigma^2 k^2/2},&lt;/math&gt;
* this defines the momentum probability distribution &lt;math&gt;|\overline{\psi}(0,k)|^2=\sigma e^{-\sigma^2 k^2}/\sqrt{\pi},&lt;/math&gt;
* and &lt;math&gt;\Delta k(0)=1/\sigma\sqrt{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The fuzziness of the position and of the momentum of a particle associated with &lt;math&gt;\psi(0,x)&lt;/math&gt; is therefore the minimum allowed by the [[This quantum world/Serious illnesses/Born#Heisenberg|&quot;uncertainty&quot; relation]]: &lt;math&gt;\Delta x(0)\,\Delta k(0)=1/2.&lt;/math&gt;

Now recall that
:&lt;math&gt;
\overline{\psi}(t,k)=\phi(0,k) e^{-i\omega t},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega=\hbar k^2/2m.&lt;/math&gt; This has the Fourier transform
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(t,x)=\sqrt{\sigma\over\sqrt{\pi}}{1\over\sqrt{\sigma^2+i\,(\hbar/m)\,t}}\,
e^{-x^2/2[\sigma^2+i\,(\hbar/m)\,t]},
&lt;/math&gt;
and this defines the position probability distribution
:&lt;math&gt;
|\psi(t,x)|^2={1\over\sqrt{\pi}\sqrt{\sigma^2+(\hbar^2/m^2\sigma^2)\,t^2}}\, e^{-x^2/[\sigma^2+(\hbar^2/m^2\sigma^2)\,t^2]}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Comparison with &lt;math&gt;|\psi(0,x)|^2&lt;/math&gt; reveals that &lt;math&gt;\sigma(t)=\sqrt{\sigma^2+(\hbar^2/m^2\sigma^2)\,t^2}.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta x(t)={\sigma(t)\over\sqrt{2}}=
{\sqrt{{\sigma^2\over2}+{\hbar^2t^2\over 2m^2\sigma^2}}}=
{\sqrt{[\Delta x(0)]^2+{\hbar^2t^2\over 4m^2[\Delta x(0)]^2}}}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The graphs below illustrate how rapidly the fuzziness of a particle the mass of an electron grows, when compared to an object the mass of a &lt;math&gt;C_{60}&lt;/math&gt; molecule or a peanut. Here we see one reason, though by no means the only one, why for all intents and purposes &quot;once sharp, always sharp&quot; is true of the positions of macroscopic objects.

Above: an electron with &lt;math&gt;\Delta x(0)=1&lt;/math&gt; nanometer. In a second, &lt;math&gt;\Delta x(t)&lt;/math&gt; grows to nearly 60 km.

Below: an electron with &lt;math&gt;\Delta x(0)=1&lt;/math&gt; centimeter. &lt;math&gt;\Delta x(t)&lt;/math&gt; grows only 16% in a second.

[[image:Spreading-wavepacket electron2.gif]]

Next, a &lt;math&gt;C_{60}&lt;/math&gt; molecule with &lt;math&gt;\Delta x(0)=1&lt;/math&gt; nanometer. In a second, &lt;math&gt;\Delta x(t)&lt;/math&gt; grows to 4.4 centimeters.

[[image:Spreading wavepacket C60.gif]]

Finally, a peanut (2.8 g) with &lt;math&gt;\Delta x(0)=1&lt;/math&gt; nanometer. &lt;math&gt;\Delta x(t)&lt;/math&gt; takes the present age of the universe to grow to 7.5 micrometers.

==Time-independent Schrödinger equation==
If the potential V does not depend on time, then the Schrödinger equation has solutions that are products of a time-independent function &lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; and a time-dependent phase factor &lt;math&gt;e^{-(i/\hbar)\,E\,t}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(t,\mathbf{r})=\psi(\mathbf{r})\,e^{-(i/\hbar)\,E\,t}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Because the probability density &lt;math&gt;|\psi(t,\mathbf{r})|^2&lt;/math&gt; is independent of time, these solutions are called ''stationary''.

Plug &lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{r})\,e^{-(i/\hbar)\,E\,t}&lt;/math&gt; into
:&lt;math&gt;
i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\cdot\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\psi + V\psi
&lt;/math&gt;
to find that &lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the time-independent Schrödinger equation
:&lt;math&gt;
E\psi(\mathbf{r})=-{\hbar^2\over2m}\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}\right)\psi(\mathbf{r})+V(\mathbf{r})\,\psi(\mathbf{r}).

===Scenario===

In quality control laboratories tests are carried out to check the quality of substances, whether they are raw materials, materials being produced/manufactured on a large scale or checks on such substances such as the quality of river water or soil or foods.

As part of your professional development as a new science technician working in the quality control laboratory of a pharmaceutical manufacturing chemical company, you have been asked to investigate:

*some key features of the periodic table
*atomic structure and chemical bonding
*the preparation of standard solutions 
*simple acid-base titrations 
*how the titrations would be carried out differently in a modern quality control laboratory.


===Task 1 P1===

Many of the elements (in compounds and their solutions) involved in carrying out the preparation of standard solutions and titrations are in different groups and periods of the periodic table. 

a)	Using the first 18 elements in the periodic table, complete the PERIODIC BASICS ACTIVITY &amp; submit as evidence

b)	Choose 1 of the first 18 elements, and complete the ADOPT AN ELEMENT activity &amp; submit as evidence

c)	Complete the CANDY CANE activity and submit as evidence

d)      Using the laboratory procedure and risk analysis provided by your tutor, safely prepare a standard solution of sodium hydroxide at 0.10M. 

Also using the laboratory procedure and risk analysis provided by your tutor, carry out two simple titrations using the sodium hydroxide solution of known molarity against:
*an unknown solution of a strong acid
*an unknown solution of a weak acid.

Repeat the titration three times to ensure that you have consistent results.
Calculate the molarity of the unknown solutions using the given calculation method to achieve accurate results.


===Task 2 M1===

Using the results obtained from your practical experiments, draw conclusions about the accuracy of your results in terms of the:
*consistency of the volume of unknown solution titrated
*the accuracy of the end point
*the indicator used
*your method of calculation.


===Task 3 D1===

a)	Explain why it is important when producing pharmaceutical products ready for consumers to prepare standard solutions and to carry out titrations accurately in a quality control laboratory.

b)	Although the fundamental concepts underlying the preparations of standard solutions and the carrying out of titrations are the same in modern industrial laboratories, the methods by which they are carried out can be different and automated. Describe how preparations of standard solutions and titrations are carried out in modern industrial laboratories.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Assignment Booklet==
*Issued	10 Sept 
*Final Deadline	21 Jan

===Context===

We continue to encounter many scientific challenges and at the centre of them all is the understanding and skill of the laboratory science technicians who work in a variety of places and scientific disciplines. The most important driving force in their success or failure will be how their laboratory is organised.

Laboratory technicians need to have a good understanding of how each of the specialist laboratories has individual requirements and also have generic procedures and practices. An understanding of safety regulations and the application of laboratory management information systems are essential. These combine to give an appreciation of how to run an efficient, effective and safe laboratory. This unit is crucial in underpinning the training of a science laboratory technician.

The unit starts by exploring the essential procedures and practices found in all laboratories. This is supported by a look at specialist laboratories. They are examined on their different individual requirements in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and
safety. This unit gives learners an appreciation of how scientific data and records are kept in a modern laboratory information system. Finally, the unit provides an essential insight into how laboratories are organised today in the light of up-to-date
safe working practices and safety regulations.

===Learning Outcomes===

On completion of this unit a learner should:

#Know how procedures are followed and information passed on in the laboratory
#Understand the design of a workplace with respect to its efficiency, effectiveness, safety and security
#Understand laboratory management information systems and a range of scientific computer applications
#Be able to demonstrate and understand safe working practices in the laboratory.

===Assignment 1 (P1/M1/D1)===

1a) Conduct a series of interviews with a Science Technician from each department, investigating procedures &amp; practices commonly undertaken by them in a laboratory.

For each procedure/practice give a brief description &amp; identify how they are communicated within the team

1b) Produce a spider diagram that highlights the main types of Science Technicians working within industry, and illustrates some of their main responsibilities.

(P1)

1c) Submit evidence of documented procedures that you have used in the laboratory.
This must include;
*Method for wiring a plug (photograph)
*Method for servicing a Bunsen burner (photograph)
*Method for flaming glass (photograph)
*Material disposal sheet
*A simple Titration

===Assignment 1 - Planning===

'''Scenario'''

Catalase is an enzyme which catalyses the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen.
It is present in most living organisms. Different organisms have different versions of the enzyme. We can use a suspension of yeast cells as ‘the enzyme’ although obviously this is not very pure. Alternatively we can use homogenised liver, parsley, etc.

As a class, we will look at various aspects of this enzyme. We will compile a book which gives a comprehensive description of catalase. You will provide one chapter to the book.

Note: Approaching the assignments in this way covers multiple Key Skills. In particular, the assignments are designed to cover the outer key skills (Working With Others, Problem Solving and Improving Own Learning and Performance) at level 2 - hence the frequent instructions to work as a team and the inclusion of a conference (which students are expected to organise for themselves). If key skills are not a priority, then these aspects can be tackled in a less involved manner.

Aspects we could include:
* Methods of following reaction – volume of oxygen, loss of mass, etc.
* Comparison of enzyme levels from the same sample over time: Use as assay for time of death
* Comparison of enzyme levels and properties from different species (e.g. yeast, liver, parsley)
* Comparison of enzyme levels from the same species at different stages in its life cycle (e.g. green, yellow, red peppers)
* Comparison of enzyme levels from different parts of the same organism
* Extraction of the enzyme from homogenised biological material
* Effect of temperature 
* Effect of pH 
* Effect of inhibitors 
* Effect of peroxide concentration

====Task 1– Choosing a topic and researching it.====

Decide what aspect of the enzyme you want to work on. Share this information with the others in the class. Are there any areas the class has failed to address? Who will tackle these areas?

What is the nature of the investigation?

State your objectives and hypothesis

Describe what type of experimental research you need to do (e.g. laboratory)

There is a lot of basic research to do, which will be common to many research topics. Make a list of what research you need to do. Share this information with the rest of the class. Who else is looking for the same information? Make arrangements to share out the task of research equitably.

What deadline will you need to set for completion of sharing research? This will need to be before the deadline for this assignment!

Break down your research targets into short deadlines. How will you find this information? Will you need help using any of these resources?

'''Information resources:'''

What information sources will you need?
* Consider textbooks, internet sources, the college’s subscription sources, BRENDA database, contact with relevant academics.

How will you extract information from them?
* Make headings based on what you need to know, and sort the information into these categories as you do your research. 

How will you record the sources?
* Use the Harvard referencing system. Note the relevant information as you go along: Author, date, title, publication/web address

Assess if the information is reliable and applies to your investigation.
* Wikipedia is notoriously unreliable – how would you check that its contents are correct?

Meets criterion P1

====Task 2 – Evaluating the research.====

Collect all the relevant research material – yours and other students’.

List the problems you need to solve to answer your research targets.

Do you now have all the information you need? How valuable is the research done so far? (Assess each piece of information)

Justify the hypothesis, experimental procedures and recording methods chosen. Confirm your decision with the lecturer.

Produce a detailed plan for your investigation, including health and safety assessments.

Health and safety risk assessments should include descriptions of how you will eliminate/minimise any identified risks;

Meets criteria P1 and D1

===Assignment 2 - The practical investigation===

'''Scenario'''

Having researched and planned an investigation into one aspect of the enzyme catalase, you now have the chance to carry out the practical work.
Your initial findings will be reported to the rest of the class at a science conference.
Your final report will form a chapter of the class’s book about catalase.

====Task 1 – The practical investigation.====

Having scientifically planned your investigation, it is time to apply those principles by doing the experimental work.

You will need to show that you can:
* Assemble the relevant equipment and materials;
* Adhere to health and safety requirements;
* Manipulate and observe experiments skillfully
* Use appropriately the instruments and techniques for taking measurements;
* Record results with accuracy, integrity, precision;
* Maintain a working laboratory book

Your records should include:
* health and safety issues
* what support you rely on
* how you cooperate with others
* how you revise your plan as you go along

The experiments will carry on after the conference which is the main focus of assignment 3. After the conference there will be time to adapt your work based on the ideas and suggestions from the meeting.

Meets criteria P2 and P3 (‘practical’ part)

===Assignment 3 - Reviewing progress===

During your work on assignment 2, you will be attending a science conference to review your progress.

Scientists regularly meet to discuss their latest progress. Conferences are less formal than publishing a research paper. Papers need to be peer-reviewed before publication. Presentations at a conference are not reviewed beforehand and the audience is expected to provide constructive criticism and suggestions.

You will present your findings so far to the rest of the class. They will help you review your progress and may use some of your ideas in their own research.

There are two forms of presentation at a conference:

'''Short lectures'''

The progress of the research is briefly described and the audience is invited to comment.

'''Posters'''

Information about the research is assembled to make a display. Other researchers can read the work at their leisure and question the researchers about their work.

This assignment is based largely on the information exchanged at the conference.

====Task 1 – The conference.====

Prepare a poster and/or presentation about your work so far.

Describe how you ensure accuracy and precision in your work.

Evaluate how effective these measures have been in making your work accurate and precise.

Meets criteria M2 and D2 (‘evaluation’ part)

====Task 2 – Review.====

Write a summary of what you have learned from the conference:

# What have you learned about your own work? Could you improve the techniques or are you justified in repeating the same methods?
# How is the rest of the class progressing? If anyone is doing better than you in any respect – how can you learn from their methods? If anyone is failing to meet their targets is there any way you can help them (without jeopardising your own work)?
# Discuss how the collaboration is working and what problems have occurred. Describe how the work has met or will meet its targets. Include your contributions. Suggest and agree ways to improve.

Meets criterion M3

====Task 3 – The practical investigation.====

Discuss possible ways to improve the accuracy and precision of your methods. 

Analyse how effective each improvement would be.

Justify whether you adopt or reject each improvement.

Meets criterion D2 (‘improvements’ part)

===Assignment 4 - Data analysis===

'''Scenario'''

As you collect more and more raw data, it becomes important to analyse the results.
You might find that one measurement is obviously wrong, and needs to be repeated.
You can check your results with those of the rest of the class, and with the studies you researched in Assignment 1, but you will need to convert your results into the same format as the other values.

====Task 1 – Data analysis.====

This work is best done as we go along, but towards the end of the investigation you need to make sure that you can make sense of all the data collected.

Collect your data into tables and graphs. Take care to show:
* organisation of data e.g. class intervals, tallying;
* correct units of experimental quantities used;
* fitness for purpose of methods used;
* repeatability;
* sources and magnitudes of errors in reading taken
* assessment of experimental accuracy and precision;

What do your data show you? You need to process and analyse the raw data e.g. mean, standard deviation, student’s t-test. Particularly useful is establishing that two results are significantly different. Make sure your calculations are accurate.

It will be useful to compare your results with any values you can find in published studies. Assess the information sources you use:
* is the source relevant?
* if so, does it support or contradict your results?

Meets criteria P3 (‘analysis’ part) and D3

===Assignment 5 - Writing your report===

'''Scenario'''

It is time to start writing your chapter of the class’s book on catalase.

There is a lot you can write already – based on your initial literature research.

As you collect and analyse more data, your conclusions and contribution will become more and more substantial.

Having done all the hard work, give your efforts the report they deserve!

====Task 1– Writing your final report.====

Write your scientific report of the investigation:
* Use correct scientific protocol i.e. structure, format;
* Use correct scientific language and terminology i.e. past passive tense;
* Include a section for relevant references and bibliography;
* Present your data in an appropriate format, to an appropriate degree of precision, and using correct units.

Meets criterion P4

====Task 2 – Conclusions.====

Read over your conclusions again.
* How are they justified?
* What experimental data supports your conclusions? Do any of your experiments contradict your conclusions; and if so, why have you ignored these results?
* How do your conclusions relate to the reports you researched in Assignment 1?

Meets criterion M4

====Task 3 – Final evaluation.====

In conclusion, your report should include:
* An evaluation of the results.
* A discussion of sources of error and how to minimize them.
* Evaluation of your conclusions – how certain are they?
* Comparison of your experimental methods and literature investigations.
* Consideration of your hypothesis – did it hold up?

Meets criterion D4

=Titration=

In [[medicine]], '''titration''' is the process of gradually adjusting the dose of a medication until the desired effect is achieved.

[[Image:Titration.gif|frame|Titration setup: the titrant drops from the [[burette]] into the [[analyte]] solution in the [[w:flask]]. An indicator present then changes color permanently at the [[w:endpoint]].]]

'''Titration''' is a common laboratory method of quantitative/[[w:Analytical chemistry|chemical analysis]] which can be used to determine the [[w:concentration]] of a known [[w:reactant]]. Because volume measurements play a key role in titration, it is also known as ''volumetric analysis''.

A [[w:reagent]], called the ''titrant'', of known concentration (a [[w:standard solution]]) and [[w:volume]] is used to react with a solution of the [[w:analyte]], whose concentration is not known in advance. Using a calibrated [[w:burette]] to add the titrant, it is possible to determine the exact volume that has been consumed when the ''endpoint'' is reached. The endpoint is the point at which the titration is complete, often determined by an indicator (see below). In the classic strong acid-strong base titration the endpoint of a titration is when the pH of the reactant is just about equal to 7, and often when the solution permanently changes colour due to an [[w:pH indicator|indicator]]. There are however many different types of titrations (see below).

Many methods can be used to indicate the endpoint of a reaction; titrations often use visual indicators (the reactant mixture changes colour). In simple [[w:acid-base titration]]s a pH indicator may be used, such as [[w:phenolphthalein]], which becomes pink when a certain pH (about 8.2) is reached or exceeded. Another example is [[w:methyl orange]], which is red in acids and yellow in alkali solutions.

Not every titration requires an indicator.  In some cases, either the reactants or the products are strongly coloured and can serve as the &quot;indicator&quot;.  For example, an [[w:redox titration|oxidation-reduction titration]] using [[w:potassium permanganate]] (pink/purple) as the titrant does not require an indicator.  When the titrant is reduced, it turns colourless. After the equivalence point, there is excess titrant present.  The equivalence point is identified from the first faint pink colour that persists in the solution being titrated.

Due to the logarithmic nature of the pH curve, the transitions are generally extremely sharp, and thus a single drop of titrant just before the ''endpoint'' can change the pH significantly — leading to an immediate colour change. That said, there is a slight difference between the change in indicator colour and the actual equivalence point of the titration. This error is referred to as an indicator error, and it is indeterminate.

==Preparing a sample for titration==
In a titration, both titrant and analyte are required to be [[aqueous]], or in a solution form. If the sample is not a liquid or solution, the samples must be dissolved. If the analyte is very concentrated in the sample, it might be useful to dilute the sample.

Although the vast majority of titrations are carried out in aqueous solution, other solvents such as glacial ethanoic acid or ethanol (in petrochemistry) are used for special purposes.

A measured mass of the sample can be placed in a flask and then be dissolved or diluted. The mathematical result of the titration can be calculated directly. Sometimes the sample is dissolved or diluted beforehand and a measured volume of the solution is used for titration. In this case the dissolving or diluting must be done accurately because the mathematical result of the titration must be multiplied with this factor.

Some non-acid-base titrations require buffering to maintain a certain pH for the reaction. Therefore, buffer solutions are added to the reactant solution in the flask.

Some titrations require &quot;masking&quot; of a certain ion. This can be necessary when two reactants in the sample would react with the titrant and only one of them must be analysed, or when the reaction would be disturbed or inhibited by this ion. In this case another solution is added to the sample which &quot;masks&quot; the unwanted ion (for instance by a weak binding with it or even forming a solid insoluble substance with it).

Some reactions may require heating the solution with the sample and titration while the solution is still hot (to increase the reaction rate).

==Procedure==
A typical titration begins with a [[w:Erlenmeyer flask|conical flask]] containing a precisely known volume of the reactant and a small amount of indicator, placed underneath a [[w:burette]] containing the reagent. By controlling the amount of reagent that is added to the reactant, it is possible to detect the point at which the indicator changes colour. As long as the indicator has been chosen correctly, this should also be the point where the reactant and reagent neutralise each other, and by reading the scale on the burette the volume of reagent can be measured.

As the concentration of the reagent is known, the number of moles of reagent can be calculated (since &lt;math&gt;concentration = moles / volume&lt;/math&gt;). Then, from the chemical equation involving the two substances, the number of moles present in the reactant can be found. Finally, by dividing the number of moles of reactant by its volume, the concentration is calculated.

==Types of titrations==
Titrations can be classified by the type of reaction. Different types of titration reaction include:
*[[w:Acid-base titration]] is based on the neutralisation reaction between the analyte and an acidic or basic titrant. These most commonly use a pH indicator, a pH meter, or a conductance meter to determine the endpoint.
*A [[w:Redox titration]] is based on an oxidation-reduction reaction between the analyte and titrant. These most commonly use a potentiometer or a redox indicator to determine the endpoint. Frequently either the reactants or the titrant have a colour intense enough that an additional indicator is not needed.
*A [[w:Complexometric titration]] is based on the formation of a [[w:complex (chemistry)|complex]] between the analyte and the titrant. The [[w:chelating agent]] [[w:EDTA]] is very commonly used to titrate metal ions in solution. These titrations generally require specialised [[w:complexometric indicator|indicator]]s that form weaker complexes with the analyte. A common example is [[w:Eriochrome Black T]] for the titration of [[w:calcium]] and [[w:magnesium]] ions.
*A form of titration can also be used to determine the concentration of a [[w:virus]] or [[w:bacterium]]. The original sample is diluted (in some fixed ratio, such as 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, etc.) until the last dilution does not give a positive test for the presence of the virus. This value, the [[w:titre]], may be based on [[w:TCID50]], [[w:EID50]], [[w:ELD50]], [[w:LD50|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] or [[w:Plaque forming units|pfu]]. This procedure is more commonly known as an [[w:assay]].

==Measuring the endpoint of a titration==
{{main|Endpoint (chemistry)}}
Different methods to determine the endpoint include:
*[[w:pH indicator]]: This is a substance that changes colour in response to a chemical change. An acid-base indicator (e.g., [[w:phenolphthalein]]) changes colour depending on the [[w:pH]]. [[Redox indicator]]s are also frequently used. A drop of indicator solution is added to the titration at the start; when the colour changes the endpoint has been reached.
*A [[w:potentiometer]] can also be used. This is an instrument which measures the [[w:electrode potential]] of the solution. These are used for titrations based on a redox reaction; the potential of the working electrode will suddenly change as the endpoint is reached.
*[[w:pH meter]]: This is a potentiometer which uses an electrode whose potential depends on the amount of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion present in the solution. (This is an example of an [[w:ion selective electrode]]. This allows the pH of the solution to be measured throughout the titration. At the end point there will be a sudden change in the measured pH. It can be more accurate than the indicator method, and is very easily automated.
*Conductance: The [[w:electrical conductivity|conductivity]] of a solution depends on the ions that are present in it. During many titrations, the conductivity changes significantly. (For instance, during an acid-base titration, the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions react to form neutral H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. This changes the conductivity of the solution.) The total conductance of the solution depends also on the other ions present in the solution (such as counter ions). Not all ions contribute equally to the conductivity; this also depends on the [[w:electrophoretic mobility|mobility]] of each ion and on the total concentration of ions ([[w:ionic strength]]). Thus, predicting the change in conductivity is harder than measuring it.
*Colour change: In some reactions, the solution changes colour without any added indicator. This is often seen in redox titrations, for instance, when the different oxidation states of the product and reactant produce different colours. Such titrations are known as 'self-indicating'.
*Precipitation: If the reaction forms a solid, then a [[w:precipitate]] will form during the titration. A classic example is the reaction between Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; to form the very insoluble salt AgCl. Surprisingly, this usually makes it difficult to determine the endpoint precisely. As a result, precipitation titrations often have to be done as &quot;back&quot; titrations (see below).
*An [[w:Calorimeter#Isothermal titration calorimeter|isothermal titration calorimeter]] uses the heat produced or consumed by the reaction to determine the endpoint. This is important in [[w:biochemistry|biochemical]] titrations, such as the determination of how [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]s bind to [[w:enzyme]]s.
*[[w:Thermometric Titration|Thermometric titrimetry]] is an extraordinarily versatile technique. This is differentiated from calorimetric titrimetry by the fact that the heat of the reaction (as indicated by temperature rise or fall) is not used to determine the amount of analyte in the sample solution. Instead, the endpoint is determined by ''the rate of temperature change''. 
*[[w:Spectroscopy]] can be used to measure the absorption of light by the solution during the titration, if the [[w:spectrum]] of the reactant, titrant or product is known. The relative amounts of the product and reactant can be used to determine the endpoint. 
*[[w:Amperometry]] can be used as a detection technique ([[w:amperometric titration]]). The current due to the oxidation or reduction of either the reactants or products at a working electrode will depend on the concentration of that species in solution. The endpoint can then be detected as a change in the current. This method is most useful when the excess titrant can be reduced, as in the titration of halides with Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. (This is handy also in that it ignores precipitates.)

===Other terms===
The term [[w:back titration]] is used when a titration is done &quot;backwards&quot;:
instead of titrating the original analyte, one adds a known excess of a
standard reagent to the solution, then titrates the excess. A back titration
is useful if the end point of the reverse titration is easier to identify
than the end point of the normal titration. They are also useful if
the reaction between the analyte and the titrant is very slow.

==Particular uses==
*As applied to [[w:biodiesel]], titration is the act of determining the [[w:acidity]] of a sample of [[wiktionary:WVO|WVO]] by the dropwise addition of a known [[base (chemistry)|base]] to the sample while testing with [[w:pH]] paper for the desired neutral pH=7 reading. By knowing how much base neutralizes an amount of WVO, we discern how much base to add to the entire [[wiktionary:batch|batch]].
*Titrations in the [[w:petrochemical]] or [[w:food industry|food]] industry to define oils, fats or biodiesel and similar substances. An example procedure for all three can be found here: [http://folk.uio.no/johnv/26thIChO/problems/p1.html].
**[[w:Acid number]]: an acid-base titration with colour indicator is used to determine the [[w:Fatty acid#Free fatty acids|free fatty acid]] content. See also: [[w:Fatty acid#pH|pH of fatty acids]].
**[[w:Iodine number]]: a redox titration with colour indication which indicates the amount of [[w:Fatty acid#Unsaturated fatty acids|unsaturated fatty acids]].
**[[w:Saponification value]]: an acid-base back titration with colour indicator or potentiometric to get a hint about the average chain length of fatty acids in a fat.

=Sampling=

==The importance of representative sampling==


“The fundamental principle behind any sampling activity is that a small amount of collected material should be representative of all the material being monitored. The number and location of samples that are needed to make up a representative sample depends on how homogeneous the material is. If it is very homogeneous, only a few samples may be required. If the material is heterogeneous, many more samples will be required.”&lt;ref name=M1&gt;[http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/GEHO1105BJXX-e-e.pdf?lang=_e Sampling requirements for stack emissions monitoring]&lt;/ref&gt;


===Monitoring can be classified into types===

# Periodic measurements – measurements are made at periodic intervals; for example, once every three months. The sample is often withdrawn from the sampling site (extractive sampling). An instrumental or automated technique may be used, where the sampling and analysis of the substance is fed to an on-line analyser. Alternatively, a technique may be used where a sample is extracted on site and analysed later in a laboratory. Samples may be obtained over several hours, or may be so-called “spot” or “grab” samples collected over a period of seconds to several minutes. &lt;ref name=M1/&gt;
# Intermittent measurements are made when convenient/possible. The timing between measurements may be semi-periodic (e.g. every day, sometime during working hours).
# Continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMs) are automated measurements carried out continuously, with few (if any) gaps in the data produced. Measurement may be carried out ''in situ'', or extractive sampling may be used with an instrument permanently located at or near the stack. CEMs are also referred to as Automated Monitoring Systems (AMS), particularly in Europe. &lt;ref name=M1/&gt;

====Should ambient air sampling be continuous or intermittent?====

Consider:&lt;ref name=M9&gt;[http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/GEHO1105BJYB-e-e.pdf?lang=_e  Ambient air monitoring methods]&lt;/ref&gt;

*the averaging period of the relevant quality criteria with which the data will be compared
*whether the impact is acute or chronic
*the detail required, e.g. short peaks averaged over three minutes, one-hour averages, daily averages, etc.


Short sampling programmes are unlikely to give data representative of long-term conditions. Meteorological conditions and source variations can have significant effects on pollutant concentrations. Where short-term peaks are of interest, these may be unusual events occurring for only a few days each year. Hence short-term monitoring campaigns are of very limited value for characterising air-pollution episodes. &lt;ref name=M9/&gt;

====Comparison of continuous and periodic monitoring for water analysis====

&lt;ref name=M18&gt;[http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/GEHO1105BJXY-e-e.pdf?lang=_e  Monitoring discharges to water and sewer]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definitions of important terms===

&lt;ref name=M1/&gt;

'''Sampling plane''' – the plane at 90° to the centreline of the stack, duct or channel at the sampling location.

'''Sampling point''' – the specific position on the sample plane from where the sample is extracted.

'''Isokinetic sampling''' – when the flow enters the sampling nozzle at the same velocity and direction as usual flow at the sampling point.

===Representative sampling of particulates, gases and liquids===

&lt;ref name=M1/&gt;

Although a flowing gas or liquid might be thought of as being more homogeneous than, for example, a stockpile of coal; such flows can become heterogeneous. This may be due to differences in chemical composition, or differences in temperature and velocity, which may lead to stratification and swirling. Where the flow is also carrying particulates or aerosols along the duct or channel, there is likely to be even less uniformity. Here, special measures must be taken to ensure samples are representative.

If the flowing sample may be heterogeneous, samples must be obtained from multiple sample points across the sampling plane to give an overall average value.

If the emission rate is to be calculated, the flowrate will need to be measured; this will require velocity measurements to be made at several points across the sampling plane.

For extractive methods involving gases or liquids carrying particulates or aerosols, the sample must be collected isokinetically.

===Ambient air sampling===

&lt;ref name=M9/&gt;

====Where to sample?====

Spatial considerations encompass both the location of monitoring positions relative to study area or emission source, and individual sampling site criteria, e.g. position relative to local emission sources and any interfering effects.

====Data handling and data analysis.====

Is the speed of results generation important? For example, results may be required in real time for public health warnings, whereas several weeks turnaround may be adequate for supplying routine results for authorisation compliance monitoring.

====How to sample?====

Both the type of sampling and analytical end method need to be considered. Sampling may be unidirectional or omnidirectional; in-situ, mobile or remote sensing. Method selection involves an appraisal of cost versus performance, the latter including limits of detection, sensitivity, speed of instrument response, susceptibility to interfering species and the overall uncertainty of the measurement.

====Supplementary data collection.====

Other information may be relevant to the study, for example meteorological conditions, process data and traffic flows. Meteorological conditions are obviously important in assessing the impact of a single source on its surroundings since they dictate the transport and dispersion of pollutants in ambient air. Many chemical transformations between reactive species in the atmosphere are also influenced.

===Soil sampling===

&lt;ref name=soil&gt;[http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/GEHO0203BKAY-e-e.pdf Performance Standard for Laboratories Undertaking Chemical Testing of Soil]&lt;/ref&gt;

If a property of the sample changes over time, then the analysis shall be carried out without as soon as possible.

If a sample has been stabilised, or preserved then this fact shall be recorded when the results are reported and details of the stabilising procedure or preserving agent shall be recorded.

When a sample has been dried and is subsequently analysed, sufficient information shall be provided to establish the stability of the parameter analysed. Such information shall provide justification for analysing the dried sample, rather than analysing the sample on a “wet-weight” or “as submitted” basis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Overview=

There are four main strands to this unit:

==Scientific theories==

How they have developed; what questions they have answered, might answer and could never answer; how new theories are developing:

* Evolution
*Gravity
*Ozone depletion
*AIDS and AIDS origin - how the disease was identified and some dissident views on its cause.
*Plate tectonics - a good example of a paradigm shift
*Relativity
*Quantum mechanics
*Big Bang
*Genetics
*How malaria spreads
*Germ theory of diseases

===The Scientific Method===

The scientific method is the ideal way for science to proceed. The simplest theory (Occam's razor) that fits the observations is tested.

Theories may adapt to new data, or an entirely new theory may be necessary. Adopting a completely new theory is called a paradigm shift.

Falsifiability: Some philosophers and scientists, most notably Karl Popper, have asserted that no empirical hypothesis, proposition, or theory can be considered scientific if no observation could be made which might contradict it.

For example, &quot;the Earth has been visited by little green men&quot; is unfalsifiable, since no amount of observation could ever demonstrate its falsehood. However, the opposite statement &quot;The Earth has not been visited by little green men&quot; ''is'' falsifiable, by the presentation of one little green visitor.

===Areas where science has the answers===

*Diagnosis of diseases; HIV, cancer, etc.
*Materials science 
*Nuclear power
*Diagnosis of genetic conditions; Down’s syndrome, cystic fibrosis, etc.
*Identify CO2 levels and global temperatures

===Areas where science might provide answers sometime===

*Nuclear fusion
*A base on the moon
*Is there life on Mars?

*How to store nuclear waste
*How to generate power without CO2
*How to remove CO2 from the atmosphere

*What causes cancer?
*Can AIDS be cured?
*Does the Higgs boson exist?

*Can chemicals be made using less energy?
*When will earthquakes occur?
*When will a volcano erupt?

*When will viral outbreaks occur?

===Areas where science does not give answers, and never will===

*Should we provide fertility treatment to the elderly?
*Who should be given the limited medical resources we have?
*What should we do now we know our unborn child has Down’s syndrome?

*Should we spend money on a moon base/particle collider/other expensive science projects?
*Is animal testing ethical?
*How much should we reduce GDP to reduce CO2 emissions?

==Public concerns about science==

Study two recent cases from the media. Are the concerns justified? Have the media made a fair contribution?

*Concerns about MMR vaccine. 
*Do badgers cause bovine TB?
*Should we put fluoride in water?

*Should we test pharmaceuticals on animals?
*Is cannabis safe?
*Can we blame our actions on our genes?

*Is the International Space Station worth it?
*How much pollution should we allow?
*What do we do about Global Warming?
* Does God exist?

*Does homeopathy work?
*Do antidepressants work?
*Should we teach evolution in schools?

*Is bisphenol-A a problem?

*[http://edition.cnn.com/TECH/science/archive/ CNN News Science]

==Ethical and moral issues==

How have scientific advances created new ethical questions? How have scientific advances affected society?

*Roy_Meadow and his controversial theory that because cot death is not inherited, multiple cases in the same family were murder.
*GM_food - can it increase the productivity of farmers? Can they afford it? Will it benefit or harm the environment? Are the foods safer? Better?
*Genetic fingerprinting - good for catching rapists, but should we all be fingerprinted?
*Contraception and abortion became much more reliable and less risky during the 20th century. Various ethical and moral objections have been raised to the use of contraception and the practice of abortion. Before the 20th century these were minor issues, because few people would take the risk. 
*Advances in surgery, particularly transplant surgery, raised important ethical questions when it first became practicable. One aspect was that the legal definition of death had to be changed to allow heart surgery. There are groups who will not accept certain types of medical procedure on ethical grounds. For example, Jehovah's Witnesses and blood transfusions.
*Antibiotics – who should receive them if supply is limited?
*DNA testing – who should be tested? Who should know?
*Genetic screening – should insurance companies know?

==Applications and funding of science==

How science is influenced by political groups. Who funds science? Who decides how to use scientific knowledge?
*Global_warming_controversy. Who benefits from the acceptance of Global Warming Theory? Who would benefit if were found to be untrue?

==Definition==
'''Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse-Game (EFG)'''

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}&lt;/math&gt; be finite relational structures, with the same set of relation symbols, and n be a fixed natural number.

A [[Finite Model Theory/Preliminaries#Game|game]] is said to be an Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse-game iff it is constituted the following way
* 2 Players: Spoiler S and Duplicator D
* Game tree:
** Root: a pair of empty sequences
** Branch: 
*** Move of S: S chooses exactly one element of either A or B that has not been chosen already (latter is not relevant in the first move)
*** Move of D: D chooses exactly one element of the remaining set that has not been chosen already, i.e. if S has chosen from A D has to choose from B and if S chose one from B D has to choose from A.
** Terminator: The game is finished iff α and β are of size n.
* Turn: Moves are carried out alternatingly, S is to move first.
* Payoff: D wins iff the final position defines a partial isomorphism by mapping the i-th elements of α and β, for all i. Else S wins
* Information: the players are assumed to have perfect information

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Content==
On completion of this unit a learner should:
:1. Know the levels of organisation within the human body
:2. Be able to relate the structure of the circulatory system to its function in a multi-cellular organism
:3. Be able to relate the structure of the respiratory system to its function
:4. Be able to relate the structure of the digestive system to its function
:5. Understand the immunological function of the lymphatic system.

==Context==

*We all appear to be fascinated by how our bodies work. This unit will give you an insight into how the human body works (human physiology). 
*Practical work and research will help you relate the material in this unit to the functioning of the human body. You will then be in a position to use this information to understand the basic systems that make up a healthy human body.
*You will also study what happens when things go wrong with the body.
*You will look at the building blocks (cells, tissues and organs) that make up the systems in the body, and study digestion, respiration and circulation. The emphasis will be on understanding the interrelationships between these systems and how they contribute to the working of the whole human body.
*You will investigate how the various human physiology systems work by doing experiments and using apparatus. The practicals may involve taking measurements to investigate respiration and cardiovascular rates, or the passage of materials around the body or through membranes. 
*You will be expected to analyse the results and draw conclusions just as a laboratory technician might do.
*By the end of the unit you will have developed your practical skills and increased your knowledge and understanding of human physiology systems. 

==Learning outcomes==
On completion of this unit a learner should:
#Understand how structure and function are related in living human cells
#Understand how the energy requirements of the human body relate to the functioning of the digestive system and be able to carry out blood sugar measurements
#Understand the role of transport systems in the human body and be able to carry out cardiovascular measurements
#Understand the structure and functioning of the respiratory system and be able to measure respiratory functions.

*Show knowledge of the structure &amp; function of the respiratory system
*Correctly interpret results.
*Explain what you are measuring.
*Give reasons for any anomalous results
*Explain what is happening!!

===Task 2 (D4)===

Analyse and draw conclusions from the data you have collected, and relate this to the functioning of the respiratory system.

Include;

*You must take your own experimental data and interpret the results against published data. 
*You must display the ability to identify crucial factors, analyse them and then reach a conclusion which you can justify using the primary and secondary data identified. 
*The method of presentation may include the use of software packages to present charts and graphs and perhaps diagrammatical representations of some conclusions.

===Task 3 (M4)===

Explain how measurements related to the respiratory system may change under different conditions including disease.

Include;

*You must demonstrate understanding of the effects of external factors on the respiratory system (such as exercise and temperature). 

*You must also know how diseases affect the respiratory system and how malfunctions can be detected in respiratory measurements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Analytical chemistry''' is the science that seeks ever-improved means of measuring the chemical composition of materials. Chemical composition is the entire picture (composition) of the material at the chemical scale and includes geometric features such as molecular morphologies and distributions of species within a sample as well as single-dimensional features such as percent composition and species identity. The analytical results enabled by analytical chemistry have played critical roles in science from the understanding of basic science to a variety of practical applications, such as biomedical applications, environmental monitoring, quality control of industrial manufacturing and [[w:forensic science]].

==Overview==

Analytical chemistry is a sub discipline of [[w:chemistry]] that has the broad mission of understanding the chemical composition of all matter and developing the tools to elucidate such compositions. This differs from other sub disciplines of chemistry in that it is not intended to understand the physical basis for the observed chemistry as with [[w:physical chemistry]] and it is not intended to control or direct chemistry as is often the case in [[w:organic chemistry]] and it is not necessarily intended to provide engineering tactics as are often used in [[w:materials science]]. Analytical chemistry generally does not attempt to use chemistry or understand its basis; however, these are common outgrowths of analytical chemistry research. Analytical chemistry has significant overlap with other branches of chemistry, especially those that are focused on a certain broad class of chemicals, such as [[organic chemistry]], [[w:inorganic chemistry]] or [[w:biochemistry]], as opposed to a particular way of understanding chemistry, such as [[w:theoretical chemistry]]. For example the field of bioanalytical chemistry is a growing area of analytical chemistry that addresses all analytical questions in biochemistry, (the chemistry of life). Analytical chemistry and experimental physical chemistry, however, have a unique relationship in that they are very unrelated in their mission but often share the most in common in the tools used in experiments.

Analytical chemistry is particularly concerned with the questions of &quot;what chemicals are present, what are their characteristics and in what quantities are they present?&quot; These questions are often involved in questions that are more dynamic such as what [[w:chemical reaction]] an [[w:enzyme]] [[w:catalysis|catalyses]] or how fast it does it, or even more dynamic such as what is the [[w:transition state]] of the reaction. Although analytical chemistry addresses these types of questions it stops after they are answered. The logical next steps of understanding what it means, how it fits into a larger system, how can this result be generalised into theory or how it can be used are not analytical chemistry. Since analytical chemistry is based on firm experimental evidence and limits itself to some fairly simple questions to the general public it is most closely associated with hard numbers such 'as how much lead is in drinking water'.

==Modern analytical chemistry==

Modern analytical chemistry is dominated by instrumental analysis. There are so many different types of instruments today that it can seem like a confusing array of acronyms rather than a unified field of study. Many analytical chemists focus on a single type of instrument. Academics tend to either focus on new applications and discoveries or on new methods of analysis. The discovery of a chemical present in blood that increases the risk of cancer would be a discovery that an analytical chemist might be involved in. An effort to develop a new method might involve the use of a [[w:tunable laser]] to increase the specificity and sensitivity of a spectrometric method. Many methods, once developed, are kept purposely static so that data can be compared over long periods of time. This is particularly true in industrial [[w:Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] (QA), forensic and environmental applications. Analytical chemistry plays an increasingly important role in the pharmaceutical industry where, aside from QA, it is used in discovery of new drug candidates and in clinical applications where understanding the interactions between the drug and the patient are critical.

==Types==
Traditionally, analytical chemistry has been split into two main types, qualitative and quantitative:

===Qualitative===
*[[w:Qualitative inorganic analysis]] seeks to establish the presence of a given [[w:chemical element|element]] or [[w:inorganic compound]] in a sample.
* Qualitative organic analysis seeks to establish the presence of a given [[w:functional group]] or [[w:organic compound]] in a sample.

===Quantitative===
* [[w:Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|Quantitative analysis]] seeks to establish the amount of a given element or compound in a sample.

==Approaches==

Most modern analytical chemistry is categorised by two different approaches such as analytical targets or analytical methods. [[w:Analytical Chemistry (journal)]] reviews two different approaches alternatively in the issue 12 of each year.

===By Analytical Targets===
* Bioanalytical chemistry 
* Material analysis
* Chemical analysis 
* Environmental analysis 
* [[w:Forensic chemistry|Forensics]]

===By Analytical Methods===
* [[w:Spectroscopy]]
* [[w:Mass Spectrometry]] 
* [[w:Spectrophotometry]] and [[w:Colorimetry]]
* [[w:Chromatography]] and [[w:Electrophoresis]]
* [[w:Crystallography]] 
* [[w:Microscopy]]
* [[w:Electrochemistry]]

==Traditional analytical techniques==

Although modern analytical chemistry is dominated by sophisticated instrumentation, the roots of analytical chemistry and some of the principles used in modern instruments are from traditional techniques many of which are still used today. These techniques also tend to form the backbone of most undergraduate analytical chemistry educational labs. Examples include:

===Titration===
{{details| w:Titration}}
Titration involves the addition of a reactant to a solution being analysed until some equivalence point is reached. Often the amount of material in the solution being analyzed may be determined. Most familiar to those who have taken college chemistry is the acid-base titration involving a colour-changing indicator. There are many other types of titrations, for example potentiometric titrations.

===Gravimetry===
{{details| w:Gravimetry}}
Gravimetric analysis involves determining the amount of material present by weighing the sample before and/or after some transformation. A common example used in undergraduate education is the determination of the amount of water in a hydrate by heating the sample to remove the water such that the difference in weight is due to the water lost.

===Inorganic qualitative analysis===
Inorganic qualitative analysis generally refers to a systematic scheme to confirm the presence of certain, usually aqueous, ions or elements by performing a series of reactions that eliminate ranges of possibilities and then confirms suspected ions with a confirming test. Sometimes small carbon containing ions are included in such schemes. With modern instrumentation these tests are rarely used but can be useful for educational purposes and in field work or other situations where access to state-of-the-art instruments are not available or expedient.

==Instrumental Analysis==

===Spectroscopy===

Spectroscopy measures the interaction of the molecules with [[w:electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic radiation]]. Spectroscopy consists of many different applications such as [[w:atomic absorption spectroscopy]], [[w:emission spectroscopy|atomic emission spectroscopy]], [[w:ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy]], [[w:infrared spectroscopy]], [[w:Raman spectroscopy]], [[w:nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]], [[w:photoemission spectroscopy]], [[w:Mössbauer spectroscopy]] and so on.

====UV-Vis Spectroscopy====

Coloured chemicals absorb electromagnetic waves in the visible part of the spectrum. The absorbed energy 

causes changes in the energy of the molecules’ electrons. The electrons change from a ‘ground state’ to an ‘excited state’.

Most transitions are not caused by visible light. Many absorb ultra-violet radiation. Chemicals which absorb UV radiation are colourless (unless they fluoresce). The energy changes when molecules of a coloured compound and of a colourless compound are illustrated below:

[[Image:Excitation_in_UV-vis.png|450px|centre|UV (right) and visible absorbance.]]

Remember that the apparent colour is caused by absorbing photons of a complementary colour. A blue compound is blue because it absorbs yellow light.

[[Image:Colour_hexagon.png|thumb|centre|350px|The hexagon has the three primary colours of light (RGB), and their complementary colours (CYM).]]

=====Chromophores=====

Chemical structures which have excited states corresponding to visible light are called'''chromophores'''. There are two  main types:

'''1. Transition Metal Complexes.'''

[[w:Transition metals|Transition metals]] form complex ions – the metal binds to small molecules or anions called ligands. The ligands allow the electrons of the metal ion to enter an excited state if the electrons absorb a photon of visible light.

e.g. tetrachlorocuprate (II) and hexaaquacopper (II) ions:

[[Image:Tetrachlorocuprate_(ii).png|right|210px]]
 
[[Image:Hexaaquacopper_(ii).png|250px]]

The partially-occupied d-orbitals of transition metal compounds are important in giving colour to transition metal complexes. See diagram (which could represent V&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;, Cr&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;+4&lt;/sup&gt;, etc.):

[[Image:Ligand_field_splitting.png|centre|400px]]

①.	In an uncomplexed ion, all the d-orbitals have the same energy.

②.	When ligands surround the ion, the negative charges of the ligands make the d-orbitals less stable (higher energy).

③.	Critically, the ligands will come closer to some d-orbitals than to others. Typically, two or three of the orbitals will be destabilised more than the remainder.

An electron in one of the lower d-orbitals can acquire the energy to be excited into a higher d-orbital:

[[Image:Excitation_in_TM_complex.png|centre|400px]]

This mechanism allows transition metal complexes to absorb photons of visible light.

'''2. Conjugated/Delocalised Electron Systems.'''

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Beta-carotene.png|450px|β-carotene]]
&lt;/center&gt;

When single and double bonds alternate, the electrons in the double bonds can enter an excited state if they absorb a photon of visible light.
e.g. β-carotene (above) has ten conjugated C=C bonds:

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Excited_aldehydes.png]]
&lt;/center&gt;

The diagram above shows the excitation energies of conjugated aldehydes. n is the number of C=C double bonds which are conjugated. The simplest (n=1) is CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH=CH-CH=O. Note how the excitation energy is lower with higher numbers of conjugated bonds.

Chromophores of dye molecules often contain unsaturated groups such as &gt;C=O and -N=N-, which are part of a conjugated bonding system, usually involving aromatic rings. Chrysoidine, a [[A-level Applied Science/Colour Chemistry/Dyes#Basic dye|basic dye]], is shown below:

[[Image:Chrysoidin.png|250px|centre|chrysoidine]]
 
Note how the –N=N- group is just the centre of a conjugated system which extends across all twelve carbon atoms and includes seven double bonds. All [[A-level Applied Science/Colour Chemistry/Dyes#Azo dye|azo dyes]] contain the -N=N- arrangement.

'''Auxochromes''': Attached to the chromophore are two -NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups which interact with the chromophore to modify the orange colour. A group of atoms attached to a chromophore which modifies the ability of that chromophore to absorb light is called an ''auxochrome''. They can modify or enhance the colour of the dye. Examples: -OH , - NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, aldehydes.

Added functional groups can also:

*alter the solubility of the dye in water or other solvents.
*bind the dye molecules to cloth, paper or other substrates.

(conjugated system) and inorganic (complex metal ion) chromopohores.]]

===Mass Spectrometry===
[[w:Mass Spectrometry]]
Mass spectrometry measures mass-to-charge ratio of molecules using [[w:Electric field|electric]] and [[w:magnetic field]]s. There are several ionization methods: electron impact, chemical ionisation, electrospray, matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation, and others. Also, mass spectrometry is categorised by approaches of mass analyers: [[w:magnetic-sector]], [[w:quadrupole mass analyser]], [[w:quadrupole ion trap]], [[w:Time-of-flight]], [[w:Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance]], and so on.

===Crystallography===
 [[w:Crystallography]]

Crystallography is a technique that characterises the chemical structure of materials at the atomic level by analysing the [[w:diffraction]] patterns of (usually) [[w:x-ray]]s that have been deflected by atoms in the material. From the raw data the relative placement of atoms in space may be determined.

===Electrochemical Analysis===
[[w:Electrochemistry]]
Electrochemistry measures the interaction of the material with an [[w:electric field]].

===Thermal Analysis===
[[w:Calorimetry]], [[w:thermogravimetric analysis]]
Calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis measure the interaction of a material and [[w:heat]].

===Separation===
{{further|w:Separation process|w:Chromatography|w:electrophoresis|l1=Separation process|l2=Chromatography|l3=Electrophoresis}}
Separation processes are used to decrease the complexity of material mixtures.  [[w:Chromatography]] and [[w:electrophoresis]] are representative of this field. 

===Hybrid Techniques===
Combinations of the above techniques produce &quot;hybrid&quot; or &quot;hyphenated&quot; techniques.  Several examples are in popular use today and new hybrid techniques are under development. For example, [[w:Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]], LC-MS, GC-IR, LC-NMR, CE-MS, and so on.

Hyphenated separation techniques refers to a combination of two (or more) techniques to detect and separate chemicals from solutions. Most often the other technique is some form of [[w:chromatography]]. Hyphenated techniques are widely used in [[w:chemistry]] and [[w:biochemistry]].

A [[w:Slash (punctuation)|slash]] is sometimes used instead of [[w:hyphen]], especially if the name of one of the methods contains a hyphen itself.

List of hyphenated techniques:

#[[w:Chromatography|LC]]-[[w:Mass spectrometry|MS]] (or [[w:HPLC]]-[[w:Mass spectrometry|MS]])
#[[w:HPLC]]/[[w:Electrospray ionization|ESI]]-[[w:Mass spectrometry|MS]]
#[[w:Chromatography|LC]]-[[w:Diode-array detection|DAD]]
#[[w:capillary electrophoresis|CE]]-[[w:Mass spectrometry|MS]]
#[[w:capillary electrophoresis|CE]]-[[w:UV]]
#[[w:Gas-liquid chromatography|GC]]-[[w:Mass spectrometry|MS]]

===Microscopy===
{{details|w:Microscopy}}
The visualization of single molecules, single cells, biological tissues and nano- micro materials is very important and attractive approach in analytical science.  Also, hybridization with other traditional analytical tools is revolutionizing analytical science.  [[Microscopy]] can be categorized into three different fields: [[optical microscopy]], [[electron microscopy]], and [[scanning probe microscopy]].  Recently, this field is rapidly progressing because of the rapid development of computer and camera industries.

===Lab-on-a-chip===
{{further|w:Microscopy|w:microfluidics|w:μTAS|l1=Microscopy|l2=Microfluidics|l3=μTAS}}
Miniaturized analytical instrumentation, which is also called as microfluidics or micro total analysis system (μTAS). The beauty of lab-on-a-chip system is that a whole device can be visualized under a microscope.

== Methods and data analysis ==

===Standard Curve===
A standard method for analysis of concentration involves the creation of a [[w:calibration curve]]. This allows for determination of the amount of a chemical in a material by comparing the results of unknown sample to those of a series known standards.If the concentration of element or compound in a sample is too high for the detection range of the technique, it can simply be diluted in a pure solvent. If the amount in the sample is below an instrument's range of measurement, the method of addition can be used. In this method a known quantity of the element or compound under study is added, and the difference between the concentration added, and the concentration observed is the amount actually in the sample.

===Internal Standards===
Sometimes an [[w:internal standard]] is added at a known concentration directly to an analytical sample to aid in quantitation. The amount of analyte present is then determined relative to the internal standard as a calibrant.

== Trends==
Analytical chemistry research is largely driven by performance (sensitivity, selectivity, robustness, [[w:linear range]], accuracy, precision, and speed), and cost (purchase, operation, training, time, and space).  

A lot of effort is put in shrinking the analysis techniques to [[w:chip]] size.  Although there are few examples of such systems competitive with traditional analysis techniques, potential advantages include size/portability, speed, and cost. (micro [[w:Total Analysis System]] (µTAS) or [[w:Lab-on-a-chip]]). [[w:Microscale chemistry]] reduces the amounts of chemicals used. 

Much effort is also put into analysing biological systems.  Examples of rapidly expanding fields in this area are:
*[[w:Genomics]] - [[w:DNA sequencing]] and its related research. [[w:Genetic fingerprinting]] and [[w:DNA microarray]] are very popular tools and research fields.
*[[w:Proteomics]] - the analysis of protein concentrations and modifications, especially in response to various stressors, at various developmental stages, or in various parts of the body.
*[[w:Metabolomics]] - similar to proteomics, but dealing with metabolites.
*[[w:Transcriptomics]]- mRNA and its associated field
*[[w:Lipidomics]] - lipids and its associated field
*Peptidomics - peptides and its associated field
*Metalomics - similar to proteomics and metabolomics, but dealing with metal concentrations and especially with their binding to proteins and other molecules.

Analytical chemistry has played critical roles in the understanding of basic science to a variety of practical applications, such as biomedical applications, environmental monitoring, quality control of industrial manufacturing, forensic science and so on. 

The recent developments of computer automation and information technologies have innervated analytical chemistry to initiate a number of new biological fields. For example, automated DNA sequencing machines were the basis to complete human genome projects leading to the birth of [[w:genomics]]. Protein identification and peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry opened a new field of [[w:proteomics]]. Furthermore, a number of ~omics based on analytical chemistry have become important areas in modern biology.

Also, analytical chemistry has been an indispensable area in the development of [[w:nanotechnology]]. Surface characterization instruments, [[w:electron microscopes]] and scanning probe microscopes enables scientists to visualize atomic structures with chemical characterizations.

Analytical chemistry is pursuing the development of practical applications and commercial instruments rather than elucidating scientific fundamentals. This may be an arguable difference from overlapping science areas such as physical chemistry and biophysics, although there isn't any distinct boundaries among disciplines in contemporary science and technology. However, this aspect may attract many engineers' interest; thus, it is not difficult to see papers from engineering departments in analytical chemistry journals.

Among active contemporary analytical chemistry research fields, micro [[w:total analysis system]] is considered as a great promise of revolutionary technology.  In this approach, integrated and miniaturised analytical systems are being developed to control and analyze single cells and single molecules. This cutting-edge technology has a promising potential of leading a new revolution in science as integrated circuits did in computer developments.

===Paper chromatography===

'''Paper chromatography''' is an analytical technique for separating and identifying compounds that are '''or can be'' coloured, especially pigments. This method has been largely replaced by thin layer chromatography, however it is still a powerful teaching tool. '''Two-way paper chromatography''', also called '''two-dimensional chromatography''', involves using two solvents and rotating the paper 90° in between. This is useful for separating complex mixtures of similar compounds, for example, amino acids.

====Technique====
[[Image:Chromatography_tank.png|thumb|220px|right|]]
A small spot of solution containing the sample is applied to a strip of chromatography paper about 1 cm from the base. This sample is adsorbed onto the paper and may form interactions with it. Any substance that reacts or bonds with  the paper cannot be measured using this technique. The paper is then dipped in to a suitable solvent such as ethanol or water, and placed in a sealed container. 

The solvent moves up the paper by capillary action, which occurs as a result of the attraction of the solvent molecules to the paper and to one another. As the solvent rises through the paper it meets and dissolves the sample mixture, which will then travel up the paper with the solvent. Different compounds in the sample mixture travel at different rates due to differences in solubility in the solvent, and due to differences in their attraction to the fibres in the paper. Paper chromatography takes anywhere from several minutes to several hours.

In some cases, paper chromatography does not separate pigments completely; this occurs when two substances appear to have the same R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; values in a particular solvent.  In these cases, two-way chromatography is used to separate the multiple-pigment spots.  The chromatogram is turned by ninety degrees, and placed in a different solvent in the same way as before; some spots separate into multiple spots, showing the presence of more than one pigment.  As before the R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; value is calculated, and the two pigments identified.

===Thin-layer chromatography===

[[Image:TLC_black_ink.jpg|thumb|200px|Separation of black ink on a TLC plate.]]
'''Thin layer chromatography''' (TLC) is a widely-used chromatography technique used to separate chemical compounds. It involves a ''stationary phase'' consisting of a thin layer of adsorbent material, usually silica gel, alumina, or cellulose immobilised onto a flat, inert carrier sheet. A ''liquid phase'' consisting of the solution to be separated dissolved in a solvent is drawn through the plate via capillary action, separating the experimental solution. It can be used to determine the pigments a plant contains, to detect pesticides or insecticides in food, in forensics to analyse the dye composition of fibres, or to identify compounds present in a given substance, among other uses.

====Plate preparation====
TLC plates are made by mixing the ''adsorbent'', such as silica gel, with a small amount of inert binder like calcium sulphate (gypsum) and water. This mixture is spread as a thick slurry on an inert carrier sheet, usually glass, thick aluminium foil, or plastic, and the resultant plate is dried and ''activated'' by heating in an oven. The thickness of the adsorbent layer is typically around 0.1&amp;ndash;0.25&amp;nbsp;mm for analytical purposes and around 1&amp;ndash;2&amp;nbsp;mm for preparative TLC.

====Technique====
The process is similar to paper chromatography with the advantage of faster runs, better separations, and the choice between different stationary phases. Because of its simplicity and speed TLC is often used for monitoring chemical reactions and for the qualitative analysis of reaction products.

A small spot of solution containing the sample is applied to a plate, about one centimeter from the base. The plate is then dipped in to a suitable solvent, such as ethanol or water, and placed in a sealed container. The solvent moves up the plate by capillary action and meets the sample mixture, which is dissolved and is carried up the plate by the solvent. Different compounds in the sample mixture travel at different rates due to differences in solubility in the solvent, and due to differences in their attraction to the stationary phase.

===Analysis of chromatograms===
After development, the spots corresponding to different compounds may be located by their colour, by ultraviolet light, ninhydrin or by treatment with iodine vapours. The final ''chromatogram'' can be compared with other known mixture chromatograms to identify sample mixes using the R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; value.

As in most other forms of chromatography, paper chromatography uses R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; values to help identify compounds. R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; values are calculated by dividing the distance the pigment travels up the paper by the distance the solvent travels (the solvent front).  Because R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; values are standard for a given compound, known R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; values can be used to aid in the identification an unknown substance in an experiment.

As the chemicals being separated may be colourless, several methods exist to visualise the spots:
* Often a small amount of a fluorescent compound, usually Manganese-activated Zinc Silicate, is added to the adsorbent that allows the visualisation of spots under a blacklight(UV&lt;sub&gt;254&lt;/sub&gt;). The adsorbent layer will thus fluoresce light green by itself, but spots of analyte quench this fluorescence. 
* Iodine vapours are a general unspecific colour reagent
* Specific colour reagents exist into which the TLC plate is dipped or which are sprayed onto the plate

Once visible, the ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; value of each spot can be determined by dividing the distance travelled by the product by the total distance travelled by the solvent (the solvent front). These values depend on the solvent used, and the type of TLC plate, and are not physical constants.

These [[Cookbook:Legumes|legumes]] are flavorful and healthy, but require [[Cookbook:Soak|soaking]].

==Ingredients==

* ½ [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]]  (225 [[Cookbook:gram|grams]]), about 1¼ [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] dry yellow split peas
* 3 or 4 cups (¾ to 1 [[Cookbook:Liter|liter]]) potable (drinking) [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* ⅛ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]], if needed (see tips)

==Procedure==

===quick method===

# Pick over beans, then add hot water.
# [[Cookbook:Boiling|Boil]] for two minutes.
# Set aside for 1 hour.
# Drain and rinse.
# [[Cookbook:Simmering|Simmer]] until tender.

===overnight method===

# Pick over beans, then add cold water.
# Soak overnight, or 6 hours minimum.
# Drain and rinse.
# Simmer until tender.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* As beans are a natural product, pick over beans, discarding any stones, dirt particles, or discolored beans before soaking or cooking.
* If you have hard water in your area, adding ⅛ teaspoon baking soda will reduce the cooking time.
* Make sure water covers beans by at least 2 [[Cookbook:Inch|inches]] (5 [[Cookbook:Centimetre (cm)|centimeters]]), check on water level every little while and don't let the top beans get above the water.

''This is a wonderful dish that is very easy to do. It does call for the use of raw eggs, which is not to everyone's taste, but to the best of my knowledge, no one has died from Carbonara sauce poisoning. However, pregnant women should not eat raw eggs as salmonella can cause spontaneous miscarriage.''

{{see also|Cookbook:Spaghetti alla Carbonara}}

==Ingredients==

* 4 free-range [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] with large yolks (double yolkers are particularly suitable!) The use of &quot;cheap&quot; eggs will have a marked effect on the sauce. Yolks as fresh and as yellow as possible please!
* 3oz [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] [[Cookbook:Pancetta|pancetta]]. PLEASE don't buy the ready cubed stuff, but the fresh, Italian version, with a little cracked pepper on the rind. If you really can't find it, smoked bacon will do. Cube into 1/4 to 3/8 pieces.
* 1 sprig of fresh [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]], finely chopped.
* 1/4 small onion, chopped finely. 
* The chopped [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] of ½ a [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]].
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste.
* parmigiano and/or pecorino romano , grated
*  pasta( spaghetti or penne) about 12 oz dry for 4 people.
==Procedure==

# Put on the desired quantity of Pasta to cook. This complete dish is often referred to as &quot;Spaghetti Carbonara&quot; but using small Penne Rigate is, in my humble opinion, better.
# Split the eggs carefully and separate the yolks from the whites (a good - and rather sensuous - way of doing this is to run the egg through the almost closed fingers of your upturned palm, so as the white runs away through the fingers, and the yolk remains in your hand!) Keep the yolks in a large bowl (and use the whites for something useful, like [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringues]], if you must!) remembering to pick out that pesky little white bit which always remains behind when you split an egg.
# Fry the pancetta on a lowish heat in a dry frying pan until it is crispy. Always make sure you have more than enough for your sauce, as the temptation to snaffle a few bits of the pancetta whilst it is cooking is irresistible ! 
# When the pancetta is cooked,drain and allow it to cool for a few minutes, before adding it to the yolks (allowing it to cool precludes you scrambling the eggs in the process of adding the piping hot fried pancetta)
# Add a pinch of rock-salt and a very generous amount indeed of ground pepper to the bowl.
# Add the lemon zest and the chopped thyme. Also add a small amount of the Parmigiano cheese to the bowl.
# Once the pasta is cooked, the '''MOST''' important thing is to get your guests to sit down at the table ...!! This dish waits for NO man, woman or child !! It '''HAS''' to be served as soon as it is ready. No ifs or buts here !
# Drain the pasta through a [[Cookbook:Colander|colander]], count to 10, which seems to allow the pasta to cool just a tad, so again it does not scramble the sauce, and add it to the carbonara mixture.
# Mix it through with a wooden spoon and serve immediately, sprinkling the remaining Parmigiano cheese over the top!!

''If you want to add a little chopped flat leaf parsley (not the curly stuff) to add colour go ahead.''

Served with a simple green salad, it's delicious.

Buon Appetito, Wikibookies

&lt;big&gt;'''Randomized evidence for breast cancer'''&lt;/big&gt; 
(in progress)


==DCIS==
===Surgery +/- RT===
*'''NSABP B-17'''
**Randomized. 818 women with DCIS, SM-. Treated with lumpectomy or lumpectomy + RT 50Gy (no boost)
**'''2001''' PMID 11498833 -- &quot;Prevention of invasive breast cancer in women with ductal carcinoma in situ: an update of the national surgical adjuvant breast and bowel project experience.&quot; (Fisher B, Semin Oncol. 2001 Aug;28(4):400-18.) Update on B-17 and B-24. F/U 12 years
***10-year IBTR: 30.8% vs. 14.9% (51% reduction);Invasive 16.4% to 7.1% (57% reduction)
***No difference in distant recurrence or contralateral breast cancers.
*'''UKCCCR''' (1990-1998)
**Randomized. 1701 women with DCIS. 2x2 factorial: BCS followed by 1) observation, 2) RT alone, 3) tamoxifen alone, or 4) RT + Tamoxifen. RT to 50 Gy, TAM 20mg qd x5 years
**'''2003''' PMID 12867108 -- &quot;Radiotherapy and tamoxifen in women with completely excised ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand: randomised controlled trial.&quot; (Houghton J, Lancet. 2003 Jul 12;362(9378):95-102.). Mean F/U 4.4 years
***Tamoxifen: no impact on invasive IBTR, benefit for DCIS IBTR (HR 0.68)
***RT: benefit for invasive IBTR (HR 0.45), and benefit for DCIS IBTR (HR 0.36). New breast events reduced 16% to 7% (SS)
***No synergy between tamoxifen and RT

*'''Swedish DCIS Trial''' (1987-1999) -- RT vs No RT
**Randomized. 1046 women, DCIS on sector resection, target clinical surgical margin 1 cm but microscopically negative SM not required; clinically N0. Arm 1) RT 50/25 vs Arm 2) no RT
**'''2008''' PMID 18250350 -- &quot;Absolute risk reductions for local recurrence after postoperative radiotherapy after sector resection for ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.&quot; (Holmberg L, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Mar 10;26(8):1247-52. Epub 2008 Feb 4.)
***Outcome: IBTR RT+ 12.1% vs RT- 27.1% (RR 0.4, SS), invasive recurrence ~50%. No difference in DMFS. Age effect: women &lt;50 RR 0.7, age &gt;50 RR ~0.3. No group defined by stratification variables that had low risk without RT
***Conclusion: RT decreases risk by ~50%, though younger women have low protective effect and older women benefit substantially

*'''EORTC 10853''' (1986-1996)
**Randomized. 1010 women with DCIS. Size &lt;=5cm. SM- (intraop evaluation of margins, re-excision if needed). Lumpectomy alone to lumpectomy + RT 50 Gy
**'''2006''' PMID 16801628 &amp;mdash; &quot;Breast-Conserving Treatment With or Without Radiotherapy in Ductal Carcinoma In Situ: Ten-Year Results of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Randomized Phase III Trial 10853--A Study by the EORTC Breast Cancer Cooperative Group and EORTC Radiotherapy Group.&quot; (Bijker N, J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jul 20;24(21):3381-7.). Median F/U 10.5 yrs. 
***10-year LR: 26% BCS alone vs 15% BCS+RT (SS), 47% reduction. All subgroups benefited.
***10-year LR: invasive 13% vs. 8% (SS), 42% reduction; DCIS 14% vs. 7% (SS), 48% reduction
***Increased risk for LR: age &lt;40, grade 2 or 3, cribiform or solid growth pattern, doubtful margin, and LE alone. Size not a prognostic factor
***No difference in OS or distant mets

===Surgery + RT +/- Tamoxifen===
*'''NSABP B-24'''
**Randomized, double-blind. N=1804 women with DCIS or LCIS, involved margins included. BCS + RT with or without tamoxifen. RT 50 Gy (no boost), TAM 20mg QD
**'''1999''' PMID 10376613 -- &quot;Tamoxifen in treatment of intraductal breast cancer: National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-24 randomised controlled trial.&quot; (Fisher B, Lancet. 1999 Jun 12;353(9169):1993-2000.) Median F/U 6.2 years
***5-year BCA events: 13.4% vs tamoxifen 8.2% (SS), ipsilateral 9.5% vs. 6.0% (SS), contralateral 3.4% vs. 2.0% (SS)
***5-year invasive: 7.2% vs 4.1% (SS), ipsilateral 4.2% vs. 2.1% (SS), 2.3% vs. 1.8% (NS)
***Younger patients are at higher risk.
***Conclusion: Tamoxifen of benefit for further reduction of invasive breast cancer recurrences.  There was no difference in regional or distant metastases.

*'''UKCCCR''' (1990-1998)
**Randomized. 1701 women with DCIS. 2x2 factorial: BCS followed by 1) observation, 2) RT alone, 3) tamoxifen alone, or 4) RT + Tamoxifen. RT to 50 Gy, TAM 20mg qd x5 years
**'''2003''' PMID 12867108 -- &quot;Radiotherapy and tamoxifen in women with completely excised ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand: randomised controlled trial.&quot; (Houghton J, Lancet. 2003 Jul 12;362(9378):95-102.). Mean F/U 4.4 years
***Tamoxifen: no impact on invasive IBTR, benefit for DCIS IBTR (HR 0.68)
***RT: benefit for invasive IBTR (HR 0.45), and benefit for DCIS IBTR (HR 0.36). New breast events reduced 16% to 7% (SS)
***No synergy between tamoxifen and RT
***Note: No benefit of tamoxifen differs from B-24 trial: authors suggest it may be due to differences in the patient population.  In B-24 33.5% of patients were under 50 compared to only 9.5% in the UK/ANZ trial.


==Extent of Surgery==
*'''NSABP B-04''' (1971-1974) -- radical mastectomy vs. total mastectomy + RT vs. total mastectomy alone
**Randomized, 2 separate randomizations. 1665 women.'' For further information, please see page at'' [[Radiation_Oncology/Breast/Early_breast/Axilla#Surgery_vs_Radiotherapy|Axilla]]
***1079 women with clinically LN-: Arm 1) radical mastectomy vs. Arm 2) total mastectomy + RT vs. Arm 3) total mastectomy alone 
***586 women with clinically LN+: Arm 1) radical mastectomy vs. Arm 2) total mastectomy + RT
**'''25-years, 2000''' PMID 12192016 -- &quot;Twenty-five-year follow-up of a randomized trial comparing radical mastectomy, total mastectomy, and total mastectomy followed by irradiation.&quot; (Fisher B, N Engl J Med. 2002 Aug 22;347(8):567-75.)
***No difference in DFS, RFS, DM, or OS
***Conclusion: No advantage to radical mastectomy. Also no survival advantage to removing occult positive nodes at surgery or to RT

*'''Denmark DBCG''' (1951-1957) -- extended radical mastectomy vs. simple mastectomy + RT
**Randomized. 666 consecutive patients with untreated primary breast CA randomized, 425 patients underwent surgery (majority of those excluded were not surgical candidates). Arm 1) extended radical mastectomy (radical mastectomy + dissection of axilla, infraclavicular, supraclavicular, and 2nd-4th intercostal spaces) vs. Arm 2) simple mastectomy + RT. RT given with opposing tangential fields including internal mammary LN + anterior/posterior fields to axilla supraclavicular region. Energy 180 kV - 400 kV, dose 42-45 Gy given in 6 days/week
**'''50-years; 2008''' PMID 18465331 -- &quot;Extended radical mastectomy versus simple mastectomy followed by radiotherapy in primary breast cancer. A fifty-year follow-up to the Copenhagen Breast Cancer randomised study.&quot; (Johansen H, Acta Oncol. 2008;47(4):633-8.)
***Outcome: 5-year OS ERM 1% vs. SM + RT 1% (NS); 30-year OS 11% vs. 9% (NS). 25-year DFS 18% vs. 14% (NS)
***Predictors: Stage I better vs. Stage II-III; premenopausal better vs. postmenopausal. Excess mortality due to breast CA demonstrable up to 20-25 years after primary diagnosis
***Toxicity: lymphedema ERM 12% vs. SM + RT 4%
***Conclusion: Mutilating extended radical mastectomy can be safely substituted by simple mastectomy with radiation; no difference in OS or DFS

**'''7-years; 2006''' PMID 17138219 -- &quot;Sentinel-lymph-node biopsy as a staging procedure in breast cancer: update of a randomised controlled study.&quot; (Veronesi U, Lancet Oncol. 2006 Dec;7(12):983-90.) Median F/U 6.6 years
***Technical outcome: SLN+ in ALND 32% vs. SLN 35% (NS). If SLN- (68%), ALND- 95% and ALND+ 5% (false negative rate 9%). Overall accuracy 97%. If LVI+, 70% had SLN+
***Clinical outcome: Axillary failure ALND 0% vs SLN 0.004% (1 patient), SCV failure 0.008% (2 patients) vs. 0%, DM 5% vs. 4%. 5-year OS 96% vs. 98% (NS)
***Toxicity: SLN patients less pain, numbness, better arm mobility, and less swelling
***Conclusion: SLND allows patients with SLN- to avoid ALND, while reducing morbidity and cost of hospital stay

*'''Kyoto''' (Japan)(1995-1997) -- ALND Level I vs. Level III
**Randomized. 522 patients. T1-3N0-1b. BCS or mastectomy. Randomized to Level I vs. Level III dissection. All oral 5-FU day 1 and tamoxifen x2 years

***10-year outcome: OS 77% vs. 74% (NS); DFS 90% vs. 88% (NS)
***Toxicity: shorter surgery, less blood loss, no difference in edema or shoulder problems
***Conclusion: Level III dissection not recommended

*'''Showa University, 2004''' (Japan)(1991-1993) -- ALND Level II vs. Level III
**Randomized. 1209 women with Stage II BCA. Mastectomy + Level II vs. Level III dissection.

***10-year outcome: OS 87% vs. 86% (NS); DFS 73% vs. 78% (NS)
***Toxicity: Level II surgery shorter with less blood loss. No difference in patients' symptoms
***Conclusion: Level III resection does not improve OS or DFS

===ALND vs. Axillary RT===
*'''NSABP B-04''' (Fisher), 1985 (1971-4) - radical mastectomy (including axillary dissection) vs total mastectomy (no axillary dissection) + XRT to chest wall and lymphatics.  
**1665 pts, operable, potentially curable cancer confined to the breast and axilla; nodes not fixed.  
**For clinically N+ pts, randomized to radical mastectomy vs total mastectomy + RT.  
**For clinically N- pts, randomized to radical mastectomy vs total mastectomy vs total mastectomy + RT.  Pts treated without axillary dissection or regional RT who later developed biopsy-proven axillary disease then went on to axillary dissection. These pts were not considered to have a LR (unless the nodes were unresectable, only in 1 pt).
**Dose was 50 Gy / 25 fx to chest wall, with 10-20 Gy boost for LN+ pts.  45 Gy to SCLV and IM nodes. 
**No systemic therapy was given.
**'''25-years, 2000''': PMID 12192016 [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/347/8/567 Full text] &amp;mdash; &quot;Twenty-five-year follow-up of a randomized trial comparing radical mastectomy, total mastectomy, and total mastectomy followed by irradiation.&quot; Fisher B et al. N Engl J Med. 2002 Aug 22;347(8):567-75.
***82% of pts had an event. Most common event was recurrence (57% LN+, 37% LN-) followed by death without evidence of cancer (25%) followed by second primary cancer (6%) and contralateral breast cancer (6%). Most recurrences (74%) were distant. 30% of LN- pts had a distant recurrence and 42% of LN+.  5% had local recurrence, and 4% had regional recurrence.  Note the continued relapses even after 10 years.
**Summary: No difference in DFS or RFS among the three LN- groups or among the two LN+ groups. 
**Conclusion: Failed to show a benefit of axillary dissection for clinically node-negative pts (compared with a wait-and-watch approach). 

*'''Institut Curie''' (France)(1982-1987) - lumpectomy + axillary surgery vs lumpectomy + axillary XRT
**Randomized. 658 pts. Clinically N0, T &lt; 3cm, randomized to axillary dissection or axillary XRT.  All patients received lumpectomy + XRT to the breast, 55 Gy + 10-15 Gy boost (total 65-70 Gy).  
***Pts randomized to axillary surgery had axillary dissection (level I and lower level II nodes inferior to axillary vein) and had XRT to SCLV and IM nodes if they had positive axillary nodes, and IM node XRT if they had a central or medially located tumor.  
***Pts randomized to axillary XRT received RT to axilla and IMN. Dose to axilla was 50 Gy; dose to SCLV and IM nodes was 45 Gy. 
***21% of the surgery group had LN+. Pts with more than one positive LN were allowed either hormonal therapy or CMF chemotherapy; some pts in XRT group received chemo. Chemotherapy in ~5% of surgery group, 3% of XRT group. Tamoxifen was allowed. Hormonal therapy given in 3-5% of patients (more in surgery group).

Results of a randomized study with 15 years of follow-up.&quot; (Louis-Sylvestre C et al. J Clin Oncol. 2004 Jan 1;22(1):97-101.)
***No difference in OS or DFS. 10-year OS 86% vs 83%; 15-year OS 75% vs 75%.  5-year DFS 83%; 10-year 72%; 15-year 64%.  5-year distant mets, 10-12%; 10-year DM 18-21%; 15-year DM 25%.  Ipsilateral breast recurrence at 5-years 7%, at 10 years 12%, at 15 years 17%.  Isolated axillary recurrence (without breast recurrence) 1% vs 3% at 15 years (p=0.04).  
**Summary: with longer followup, no difference. Data agree with results from B-04

===ALND vs. Tangents Only RT===
*'''International Breast Cancer Study Group Trial 10-93''', 2006 (1993-2002) - PMID 16344321 &amp;mdash; &quot;Randomized Trial Comparing Axillary Clearance Versus No Axillary Clearance in Older Patients With Breast Cancer: First Results of International Breast Cancer Study Group Trial 10-93.&quot; IBCSG (Rudenstam CM). J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jan 20;24(3):337-44.
**473 pts. Women &gt;= 60 yrs, clinically node negative, operable, eligible for tamoxifen. Randomized to primary surgery + axillary clearance vs surgery without axillary clearance. Both groups received tamoxifen. Primary end point was quality of life.  Axillary staging was clinical; no sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. RT was tangents, no axillary RT.
**Median f/u 6.6 yrs. 42% had 2 cm or larger tumors. 20% of pts (of those dissected) had 1-3 LN, 8% had 4 or more LN. Largest difference in QOL was before first post-op visit. Differences disappeared by 6-12 months. At median f/u, similar DFS and OS. 2% axillary recurrence rate (same in both arms). 
**Avoiding axillary clearance leads to similar efficacy and better early QOL.

'''Aim of this lesson:''' Learn about and use the Past Perfect and understand the difference between the tense and Past Simple.  Vocabulary that will be taught is related to cinema.

== Speaking about films ==
''Work with a partner, if you can, and ask/answer these questions.  If you're on your own you should think about these questions and write your answers instead.''

* What's your favourite kind of film?
* What films have you seen this year?
* Who is your favourite male or female actor?
* What's the best film you've ever seen?
* Do you prefer watching films at home or at the cinema?

== Grammar - Past Perfect ==

Past perfect is used in English to indicate that an event occurred before another past event.
[[Image:LowryCentre.jpg|thumb|330px|right|Lowry Centre, Salford Quays, United Kingdom]]

{| {{English/B2/Table|Grammar|Past Perfect||3}}
!
! Form
! Example
|-
| + positive
| subject + had + past participle
| I had just eaten dinner when the phone rang.
|-
| - negative
| subject + hadn't (had not) + past participle
| I hadn't started making dinner when the electricity went off
|-
| ? questions
| had + subject + past participle
| Had you ever worked in a bar before getting this job?
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
* It is very unusual to use past perfect on its own.  This tense is almost always used with past simple or another tense as you can see in the examples above.
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E6EBBE&quot;|
* the negative form of the past perfect isn't very common
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
* &quot;I had just eaten dinner when the phone rang&quot; - first I ate dinner and then the phone rang.
|}

=== Further examples of past simple and past perfect ===

* How many hours had you slept for when your alarm clock went off this morning?
* My mother was angry because I had crashed her car.
* She didn't realise that she had forgotten her credit card until she got to the cash machine.
* I had only walked 100 metres when it started raining.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What should you read in English?==

By this stage you should be able to understand the main idea and key words of many articles.  You will still have difficulty recognising and using many words but you should not let this prevent you from attempting to read in English.  The following newspapers can be read online.  Newspapers like ''The Guardian'' are considered to be broadsheet newspapers and articles are usually longer and may use more formal vocabulary.  Newspapers like ''The Sun'' are tabloid newspapers and their articles are often shorter, with more pictures but they may use very informal language, idioms and phrasal verbs which may be a challenge for non-native speakers to read.  English varies around the world so you should try to read articles from many different countries

'''Water''' is both added to food as an ingredient and used to transfer heat for cooking.

For both such purposes, the water should be generally drinkable. Water is a common source of disease organisms. [[Cookbook:Boiling|Boiling]] water for about 5 minutes should take care of this problem. Baked goods containing water also need to be kept at a boiling temperature to prevent the spread of disease.

Water-based cooking methods include:

*[[Cookbook:Blanching|blanching]]
*[[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]]
*[[Cookbook:Poaching|poaching]]
*[[Cookbook:Simmering|simmering]]
*[[Cookbook:Steaming|steaming]]

==Water for fermenting==
When adding water to a [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented food]], it is generally best to use water with little or no chlorine. Chlorine is added to water to kill harmful microbes such as bacteria, and as such, can change how well a fermentation progresses, by slowing it down or even by ruining it. 

Commercial [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] ferments like [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]] are not as sensitive to chlorine as yeast / bacteria ferments like sourdough, but often still benefit from chlorine-free water as it also affects the taste of the final product.

Chlorine can be removed from tap water by boiling for a few minutes and leaving to cool. Also, leaving uncovered overnight (e.g. in the refrigerator) will reduce chlorine. However, some water suppliers are now using the more stable chloramine instead, which cannot be boiled out and will remain stable in water for longer periods. Many water filters will remove both chlorine and chloramine.

==Potable==

Potable means &quot;drinking&quot; quality. Making water potable involves several steps.
#Remember, some contaminants cannot be removed except with a reverse osmosis filter, for example, heavy metals, or poisons that, in trace amounts, are still toxic, like dioxin.
#Gross physical contaminants should be removed, by pulling them out, coarse filtration with screens or sand, or settling in a quiet pond.
#Fine physical contaminants (haziness or cloudiness) may be removed by fine filtration, filtering through activated charcoal, or by settling with agents, such as diatomaceous earth.
#Biological purification should be performed on any natural water source on the surface. This may be chemical, with chlorine bleach or iodine (will stain clothing), or boiling for 5 minutes ''at an actively rolling boil.''
#After boiling, the water often tastes flat, and this can usually be remedied by pouring the purified water from pan to pan (they must be ''clean!'') for several minutes to put dissolved air back into the liquid.
#Distillation can often be used to make water potable but volatiles, such as petroleum products will usually distill along with the water. After distillation, the water will taste flat.

[[Image:Pesto being processed.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Pesto in a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]]]]

'''Pesto''' is a sauce which is added mainly, but by no means exclusively to [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]]. Pesto is purely the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] version of this delicious sauce, with other names for the same (or similar) sauce from other countries. Another famous national variant to pesto is ''pistou'', which is the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French]] equivalent.

{{see also|Cookbook:Pesto}}

== Ingredients ==

* the best quality [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] you can find. I believe that Greek olive oil is actually better for this recipe than either French or Italian as it has a stronger taste.
* a packet of either [[Cookbook:Pine Nut|pine nuts]] or [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnuts]] (pine nuts give the pesto a blander flavour, walnuts a more robust flavour)
* at least 2 large plants of fresh [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]
* 7 [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves
* freshly grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]] (not Pecorino please)

== Procedure ==

# Whatever you may have been told, use a electric [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] or a liquidiser to make pesto. Faffing about with a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|pestle and mortar]] is for the birds !!
# Again, whatever you have been told, put a good quantity of olive oil in the blender ''first'' and start it running, otherwise the blades will gum up and you risk burning the basil.
# Drop basil leaves through the top into the olive oil so that they are mulched up by the blades.
# Add some pine nuts (or walnuts) so they are also mulched up.
# When the developing Pesto sticks and becomes too thick, simply add more olive oil until the whole lot starts to mulch again. Continue adding basil leaves, pine nuts (walnuts) and the garlic cloves, always making sure the mixture remains fluid.
# Once you begin to run out of basil leaves and nuts add a handful of Parmesan cheese (though not too much; remember the taste should be predominantly of basil).

The end result should be a wondrous smelling, glutinous mass of green which should be then emptied out of the blender into its own container.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* If you like your pesto a little rough, add a small extra quantity of pine nuts and some grated Parmesan cheese to the finished pesto and mix in well. You're ready to go.
* Fresh pesto can be stirred into pasta (penne in my opinion being the best), added as a topping to crostini, or eaten, with eyes closed and a smile on your face, off a spoon, entirely on its own.
*

== How to Install ==

{{User:Whiteknight/Gadget Instructions 2|remotetalk.js|ie7=yes|ie6=yes|ff2=yes|ff3=yes|safari=yes|chrome=yes}}

=== Accessing the Gadget ===

Once you have installed the necessary javascript and properly configured it (see below), you can access the remote talk gadget by coming to this page or by transcluding this page into another page where you want it to appear (such as your user or user talk page). To do this, add this to the appropriate page:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{User:Whiteknight/Remotetalk Gadget}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=== How to Configure ===

To configure this gadget to look at the correct pages, you need to create a 2-D array named &quot;Alias&quot; to contain the parameters:

 var Alias = new Array(
   [LANG, PROJECT, USERNAME, LINKNAME],
   [LANG, PROJECT, USERNAME, LINKNAME],
   ...);

The LANG is the 2 or 3 letter language code (such as &quot;en&quot;). PROJECT is the name of the project using all lower-case letters. The URL is created by:

 LANG.PROJECT.org

So if you want to make a link to a page at meta, you would say:

 ['meta', 'wikimedia', ...],

The USERNAME is your username on that project. LINKNAME is the words that you want to appear as the hyperlink. For instance, the following code:
 
 var Alias = new Array(
   ['en', 'wikipedia', 'TimmyWikibookian', 'Me at Wikipedia']
 );
 import_script('User:Whiteknight/remotetalk2.js');

Will produce a link that says &quot;Me At Wikipedia&quot;, and loads the page at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:TimmyWikibookian&quot;. If you leave one of the fields blank, or if you do not create an Alias array at all, defaults will be provided for you.

;Note:I am working on an easier way to install the gadget. Future versions will hopefully be easier to install.

== About this Gadget ==

This gadget is used to view the talk pages of multiple user accounts on other projects from a single location. It uses IFRAME elements for the page loads, instead of AJAX, so that the server can be remote. You must install the script and properly configure it before use.

== To Do ==

*Figure out why it doesnt work in safari

== Version History ==

*3.01 Fixed for complete compatibility with IE
*3.00 Complete rewrite using new gadgets framework.
*2.00 Major rewrite, integrated into my gadgets framework, allowed default parameters for various fields.
*1.00 First stable version

===1...b6===
Black prepares to fianchetto his queenside bishop. This move is not popular at the professional level because it gives white easy development and a full pawn centre, while black himself will be constrained to the last three ranks of the board for some time. Nonetheless, it has occasionally been dabbled with and black can get good counterplay if white is unwise and overextends his pawns in the centre.

White generally responds to Owen's Defence with 2. d4, preparing to take over the centre.

== flags ==

The current flags (German, Austrian, Swiss) don't make much sense to me because the English translation isn't related to these flags. Moreover, in Switzerland you would always use &quot;ss&quot; instead of &quot;ß&quot;. Moreover, the flags aren't used anywhere else; thus, maybe it's best to get rid of them. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 08:27, 8 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Gothic}}
=== What is a case? ===
In the simplest terms, a case is what will determine how a word is used in a sentence. Gothic makes these cases destinctive for each type of stem that is used by using Verb Strength. Cases are not a prominent feature in English unless you go into the forms of questions and personal nouns, so it might be harder for you to understand. We only use one case in speech for the most part, maybe two. In Gothic, we have four basic cases that we will use:
* The '''Nominative Case''', which describes the subject of a sentence. Example: '''The man''' went to the store.
* The '''Genitive Case''', which describes who owns an object. Example: This is '''the man's''' store.
* The '''Dative Case''', which describes the &lt;u&gt;Indirect Object&lt;/u&gt; of a sentence.  Example: The man gave the money '''to the storekeeper'''.
* The '''Accusative Case''', which describes the direct object of a sentence if the verb requires a subject and a direct object in order for the sentence to be logical. Example: The man bought '''blocks'''.

That is all you need to know about cases.</text>

&lt;/div&gt;

==Why energy is quantized==

Limiting ourselves again to one spatial dimension, we write the time independent Schrödinger equation in this form:
:&lt;math&gt;
{d^2\psi(x)\over dx^2}=A(x)\,\psi(x),\qquad A(x)={2m\over\hbar^2}\Big[V(x)-E\Big].
&lt;/math&gt;
Since this equation contains no complex numbers except possibly &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; itself, it has real solutions, and these are the ones in which we are interested. You will notice that if &lt;math&gt;V&gt;E,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is positive and &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; has the same sign as its second derivative. This means that the graph of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; curves upward above the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis and downward below it. Thus it cannot cross the axis. On the other hand, if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;E,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is negative and &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and its second derivative have opposite signs. In this case the graph of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; curves downward above the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis and upward below it. As a result, the graph of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; keeps crossing the axis — it is a wave. Moreover, the larger the difference &lt;math&gt;E-V,&lt;/math&gt; the larger the curvature of the graph; and the larger the curvature, the smaller the wavelength. In particle terms, the higher the kinetic energy, the higher the momentum.

Let us now find the solutions that describe a particle &quot;trapped&quot; in a potential well — a bound state. Consider this potential:

&lt;br&gt;[[image:Potential energy well.svg|480px]]

&lt;br&gt;Observe, to begin with, that at &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;E=V,&lt;/math&gt; the slope of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; does not change since &lt;math&gt;d^2\psi(x)/dx^2=0&lt;/math&gt; at these points. This tells us  that the probability of finding the particle cannot suddenly drop to zero at these points. It will therefore be possible to find the particle to the left of &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; or to the right of &lt;math&gt;x_2,&lt;/math&gt; where classically it could not be. (A classical particle would oscillates back and forth between these points.)

Next, take into account that the probability distributions defined by &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; must be normalizable. For the graph of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; this means that it must approach the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis asymptotically as &lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow\pm\infty.&lt;/math&gt; 

Suppose that we have a normalized solution for a particular value &lt;math&gt;E.&lt;/math&gt; If we increase or decrease the value of &lt;math&gt;E,&lt;/math&gt; the curvature of the graph of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; increases or decreases. A small increase or decrease won't give us another solution: &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; won't vanish asymptotically for both positive and negative &lt;math&gt;x.&lt;/math&gt; To obtain another solution, we must increase &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; by just the right amount to increase or decrease by one the number of wave nodes between the &quot;classical&quot; turning points &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; and to make &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; again vanish asymptotically in both directions.

The bottom line is that the energy of a bound particle — a particle &quot;trapped&quot; in a potential well — is ''quantized'': only certain values &lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt; yield solutions &lt;math&gt;\psi_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; of the time-independent Schrödinger equation:

I am one of the editors over at the Muggle's Guide, and I note that you have been playing with the series timeline; and I wonder why you chose to put Riddle's application for the DADA teacher's job as late as you did. I'm not saying it's wrong, mind -- we have no information that I can see that would suggest either way when the application was... but I'm interested in '''why''' you chose the date you did. Would you be so kind as to go to the Discussion tab on the Timeline page and fill in something about your reasoning? Thank you very much...

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Herbrand Theories==
Until now we considered arbitrary interpretations of formulae in
predicate logics. In particular we sometimes used numbers as
interpretation domain and functions, like addition or successor. In
the following, we will concentrate on a special case, the Herbrand
interpretation and we will discuss their relation to the general
case. 
==Definition 11==
Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a set of clauses. The Herbrand universe &lt;math&gt;U_H&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
  
*All constants which occur in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are in  &lt;math&gt;U_H&lt;/math&gt; (if no   constant appears in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, we assume a single constant, say &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to be in &lt;math&gt;U_H&lt;/math&gt;). 
*For every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary function symbol &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;t_1, \cdots,t_n \in U_H &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(t_1, \cdots , t_n)\in U_H&lt;/math&gt;. 

'''Examples:''' Given the clause set  &lt;math&gt;S_1 = \{ P(a),  \lnot P(x) \lor
P(f(x))\}&lt;/math&gt;, we construct the Herbrand universe
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
 U_H = \{ a, f(a), f(f(a)), f(f(f(a))), \cdots \}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For the clause set &lt;math&gt;S_2 = \{ P(x)\lor
Q(x), R(z)\}&lt;/math&gt;  we get the Herbrand universe &lt;math&gt;U_H =\{a\}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition 12==
Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a set of clauses. An interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} = (U_\mathcal{I}, A_\mathcal{I})&lt;/math&gt;
is an Herbrand interpretation iff
  
*&lt;math&gt;U_\mathcal{I} = U_H&lt;/math&gt;  
*For every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary function symbol (&lt;math&gt;n\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_1,   \cdots, t_n \in U_H&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; f^\mathcal{I} (t_1, \cdots , t_n) =f(t_1,\cdots , t_n) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Note, that there is no restriction on the assignments of relations to
predicate symbols (except, that, of course, they  have  to be
relations over the Herbrand universe &lt;math&gt;U_H&lt;/math&gt;).

In order to discuss the interpretation of predicate symbols, we need
the notion of Herbrand basis.

==Definition 13==

A ground atom or a  ground term is an atom or a
term without an occurrence of a variable.
The Herbrand basis for a set of clauses &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the set of
ground atoms &lt;math&gt;p(t_1, \ldots, t_n)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary predicate
symbol from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_1, \ldots, t_n \in U_H&lt;/math&gt;


We will notate the assignments of relations to predicate symbols by
simply giving a set &lt;math&gt;I = \{ m_1, m_2, \cdots , m_n, \cdots \}&lt;/math&gt;, where each
element is a literal with its atom is from the Herbrand basis.

'''Examples:'''

  
*&lt;math&gt;S= \{p(x) \lor q(x), r(f(y))\} &lt;/math&gt; 
*&lt;math&gt;U_H = \{ a, f(a), f(f(a)), \ldots\} &lt;/math&gt; 
*&lt;math&gt;I = \{ p(a), q(a), r(a), p(f(a)), q(f(a)), r(f(a)), \cdots \} &lt;/math&gt;

==Definition 14==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} =( U_\mathcal{I}, A_\mathcal{I} )&lt;/math&gt; be an interpretation for a set of clauses &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;; the Herbrand
interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}^*&lt;/math&gt;  corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; is a Herbrand
interpretation satisfying the following condition:
Let  &lt;math&gt;t_1,\ldots, t_n &lt;/math&gt; be Elements from the Herbrand universe &lt;math&gt;U_H&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. By the interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; every &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; is mapped to a
&lt;math&gt;d_i \in U_\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;p^\mathcal{I}(d_1, \ldots, d_n) = true (false)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;p(t_1,
\ldots, t_n) &lt;/math&gt; have to be assigned &lt;math&gt;true (false)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}^*&lt;/math&gt;.

Let us now state a simple, very obvious  lemma, which will help us,
to focus on Herbrand interpretation in the following.

==Lemma 4==
If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; is a model for a set of clauses, then every corresponding
Herbrand interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}^*&lt;/math&gt; is a model for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;

==Theorem 4==
A set of clauses &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable iff there is no Herbrand
model  for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:''' If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable, there is obviously no Herbrand
model for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
Assume that  there is no Herbrand model for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is
satisfiable. Then, there is a model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;  and according to
lemma 4 the corresponding Herbrand
interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}^*&lt;/math&gt; is a model for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, which is a
contradiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Semantic Trees==
In this section we introduce the concept of semantic trees, which then can
be used to proof completeness of resolution. For this we assume
familiarity with the concepts of trees, binary trees 
and paths in trees.

==Definition 15==
A semantic tree for a set of clauses &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a 
binary tree &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; with root &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt;, such that the edges are label with
literals, built from elements from the Herbrand basis of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, such
that:
  
*If &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is an inner node, its two outgoing edges are label with complementary literals &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot A&lt;/math&gt;. 
*Every path  to a node  &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;  in &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; does not contain  complementary literals in &lt;math&gt;I(N)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I(N)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of   literals which are labels  along the edges of the path.

==Definition 16==

A semantic tree is called complete, if every path contains every atom
from the Herbrand basis either positive or negative. 

'''Example:''' &lt;math&gt;S = \{ p(x), q(f(x))\} &lt;/math&gt; with Herbrand basis
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\{p(a), q(a), p(f(a)), q(f(a)), p(f(f(a))), \ldots\} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Note, that for a semantic tree &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and a node &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; the set &lt;math&gt;I(N)&lt;/math&gt;
can be seen as an assignment of truth-values to ground atoms, as it
is done in an Herbrand interpretation. Hence we call &lt;math&gt;I(N)&lt;/math&gt; a
partial interpretation. A complete semantic tree corresponds to an
exhaustive &quot;enumeration&quot; of interpretations.

==Definition 17==
*A node &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of a semantic tree &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a failure node if &lt;math&gt;I(N)&lt;/math&gt; falsifies some ground instance of a clause in  &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;I(N')&lt;/math&gt;  does not falsifiy any ground instance of a clause in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; for every ancestor node &lt;math&gt;N'&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. 
*A semantic tree &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is called closed if every path contains a failure node. 
*A node &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of a closed semantic tree is called an inference node, if both immediate descendant nodes are failure nodes. 

'''Example:''' &lt;math&gt;S = \{ p(x), \lnot p(x) \lor q(f(x)), \lnot q(f(a))\} &lt;/math&gt; with
Herbrand basis
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\{
p(a), q(a), p(f(a)), q(f(a)), p(f(f(a))), \ldots\} 
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a complete semantic tree, than we call &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; the
corresponding closed tree, if it is obtainable from &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; by cutting
all branches at a failure node.

==Theorem 5 (Herbrand's Theorem - Version 1)==

A set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of clauses is unsatisfiable, iff for every complete
semantic tree for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; there is a corresponding finite closed
semantic tree.

'''Proof:''' Assume &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to be unsatisfiable and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; a complete
semantic tree for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. For every path &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; we have the set of
labels &lt;math&gt;I_B&lt;/math&gt;, which is an interpretation, because the tree is
complete. Hence, &lt;math&gt;I_B&lt;/math&gt; falsifies a ground instance &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; of a clause
&lt;math&gt;C \in S&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable. Since there are only
finitely many literals in  &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt;, there must be a failure node
&lt;math&gt;N_B&lt;/math&gt; in a finite distance from the root. Since every path has such
a failure node, there is a corresponding closed semantic tree &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt;,
which is finite.

For the opposite direction, assume that for every complete semantic
tree &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; there is a finite closed corresponding tree &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt;. Then,
every path contains a failure node, and hence, every interpretation
falsifies &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;; hence &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable.

==Theorem 6 (Herbrand's Theorem - Version 2)==
A set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of clauses is unsatisfiable, iff there is a finite
unsatisfiable set &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; of ground instances of clauses in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. 

'''Proof:''' Assume &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to be unsatisfiable and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; a complete
semantic tree for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. By Herbrand's theorem, version 1, there is a
finite closed semantic tree &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; be the set of
ground instances of clauses, which are falsified at all failure nodes
of &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; is finite and is falisified by every interpretation and
hence unsatisfiable.
The opposite direction we show by contraposition:

Note, that this version of Herbrand's theorem can be turned directly
into a proof procedure:
Given a set of clauses &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, for which we want to proof
unsatisfiability.

  
*Generate &lt;math&gt;S_1', \ldots, S_n', \ldots &lt;/math&gt; sets of ground instances of clauses of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Perform a propositional test for unsatisfiability   on each of them.  
*According to Herbrand's theorem, there is a finite &lt;math&gt;S_N'&lt;/math&gt; which is unsatisfiable, if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable.

==Problems==
====Problem 10 (Predicate)====
Assume the following set of clauses:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; M_0 = \{ \{p(x)\}, \{q(x,f(x)),\lnot p(x)\},\{\lnot q(g(y),z)\} \} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  
#Indicate (a) the Herbrand-universe and (b) the Herbrand-basis for &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt;! 
#Give  a closed semantic tree for &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt;! 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;
====Problem 11 (Predicate)====
The following formulae &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are given.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
F  =  \forall y  p(y) \land \exists z  \lnot p(z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
G  =  r(a) \land \forall x (r(x) \to r(f(x)))
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Give for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;  (a) a finate and (b) an
infinite Herbrand model, or argument if this  is not
possible.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

====Problem 12 (Predicate)====
The following  sets of clauses are  given:
  
#&lt;math&gt;M_1 = \big\{ \{ p(a,x) \}, \{ \lnot p(y,b), q(y) \} \big\}&lt;/math&gt;             
#&lt;math&gt;M_2 = \big\{ \{ r(x), r(f(x)) \} \big\}&lt;/math&gt; 
Give for each of them  (a) a Herbrand universe, (b)  Herbrand model
and (c) a non-Herbrand model.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

==A quantum bouncing ball==
As a specific example, consider the following potential:
:&lt;math&gt;
V(z)=mgz\quad\hbox{if}\quad z&gt;0\quad\hbox{and}\quad V(z)=\infty\quad\hbox{if}\quad z&lt;0.
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational acceleration at the floor. For &lt;math&gt;z&lt;0,&lt;/math&gt; the Schrödinger equation as given in the 
[[This quantum world/Implications and applications/Why energy is quantized|previous section]] tells us that &lt;math&gt;d^2\psi(z)/dz^2=\infty&lt;/math&gt; unless &lt;math&gt;\psi(z)=0.&lt;/math&gt; The only sensible solution for negative &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is therefore &lt;math&gt;\psi(z)=0.&lt;/math&gt; The requirement that  &lt;math&gt;V(z)=\infty&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;z&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; ensures that our perfectly elastic, frictionless quantum bouncer won't be found below the floor.

Since a picture is worth more than a thousand words, we won't solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for this particular potential but merely plot its first eight solutions:

&lt;br&gt;[[image:Quantum bouncer.png|580px]]

&lt;br&gt;Where would a classical bouncing ball subject to the same potential reverse its direction of motion? Observe the correlation between position and momentum (wavenumber).

All of these states are stationary; the probability of finding the quantum bouncer in any particular interval of the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis is independent of time. So how do we get it to move?

Recall that any linear combination of solutions of the Schrödinger equation is another solution. Consider this linear combination of two stationary states:
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(t,x)=A\,\psi_1(x)\,e^{-i\omega_1t}+B\,\psi_2(x)\,e^{-i\omega_2t}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Assuming that the coefficients &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; and the wave functions &lt;math&gt;\psi_1(x),\psi_2(x)&lt;/math&gt; are real, we calculate the mean position of a particle associated with &lt;math&gt;\psi(t,x)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\int\!dx\,\psi^*x\psi=\int\!dx\,(A\psi_1e^{i\omega_1t}+B\psi_2e^{i\omega_2t})\,x\,(A\psi_1e^{-i\omega_1t}+B\psi_2e^{-i\omega_2t})&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;=A^2\int\!dx\,\psi_1^2\,x+B^2\int\!dx\,\psi_2^2\,x+AB(e^{i(\omega_1-\omega_2)t}+e^{i(\omega_2-\omega_1)t})\int\!dx\,\psi_1x\psi_2.
&lt;/math&gt;
The first two integrals are the (time-independent) mean positions of a particle associated with &lt;math&gt;\psi_1(x)\,e^{i\omega_1t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi_2(x)\,e^{i\omega_2t},&lt;/math&gt; respectively. The last term equals
:&lt;math&gt;
2AB\cos(\Delta\omega\,t)\int\!dx\,\psi_1x\psi_2,
&lt;/math&gt;
and this tells us that the particle's mean position oscillates with frequency &lt;math&gt;\Delta\omega= \omega_2-\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; and amplitude &lt;math&gt;2AB\int\!dx\,\psi_1x\psi_2&lt;/math&gt; about the sum of the first two terms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Resolution==
In the propositional case we defined the resolution inference rule by
&quot;cutting away&quot; a pair of complementary literals in two clauses which 
are resolved upon. In the first order case however this is not always
sufficient:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
C_1: &amp; p(x) \lor q(x) \\

C_2: &amp; \lnot p(f(x))
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In these two clauses there are no complementary literals, however,
after substituting the term &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt; for the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; we arrive at:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
C_1': &amp; p(f(a)) \lor q(f(a)) \\ 

C_2': &amp; \lnot p(f(a))
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Now we can apply the inference rule from propositional logic and
arrive at the resolvent &lt;math&gt;q(f(a))&lt;/math&gt;.

Another possibility is to substitute &lt;math&gt;f(x')&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; to get
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
C_1'':  p(f(x')) \lor q(f(x')) 
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and then we can have the resolvent &lt;math&gt;q(f(x'))&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;C_1''&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;, which is in a certain sense more general then the resolvent derived
previously.

==Definition 18 ==
A substitution &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a function, which maps variables 
to terms and which is the identical mapping almost everywhere. Hence
it can be represented as 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sigma =\{x_1 / t_1, \cdots , x_n / t_n\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;t_1, \cdots , t_n&lt;/math&gt; are groundterms, we call &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; a
ground substitution. The empty substitution is
notated by &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; .

==Definition 19 ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\theta = \{ x_1 / t_1, \cdots , x_n / t_n\}&lt;/math&gt; be a substitution and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; an
expression (i.e. a literal or a term), then &lt;math&gt;E\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the expression, 
obtained from &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; by replacing simultaneously each occurrence of
&lt;math&gt;X_i, 1 \leq i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;  in &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; by the term &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;. 

Example:&lt;br&gt;
With  &lt;math&gt;\theta = \{ x/a, y/f(b), z/e\}&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;E = p(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;, we get &lt;math&gt;E\theta = p(a,f(b),c)&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition 20 ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \{ x_1 / t_1, \cdots , x_n / t_n\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \lambda = \{ y_1/s_1,\cdots , y_m/s_m\}&lt;/math&gt; be substitutions. Then the composition of substitutions, denoted by &lt;math&gt; \sigma \circ \lambda &lt;/math&gt;,
is the substitution, which is obtained from &lt;math&gt; \{ x_1 / t_1 \lambda,
\cdots,x_n / t_n \lambda, y_1/s_1,\cdots , y_m/s_m \}&lt;/math&gt; by deleting any element
&lt;math&gt;x_j/t_j \lambda&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt; t_j \lambda = x_j&lt;/math&gt; and any element
&lt;math&gt;y_i/s_i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;y_i \in\{ x_1, \cdots, x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; .
&lt;br&gt;
Example:

==Definition 21 ==
Let &lt;math&gt; \{E_1, \cdots, E_n\}&lt;/math&gt;  be a set of expressions and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; a
substitution, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is unifier for  &lt;math&gt; \{E_1, \cdots, E_n\}&lt;/math&gt;
iff 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;E_1\theta = E_2\theta = \cdots E_n\theta &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;.

A unifier &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is called most general unifier iff for every
unifier &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; there is a substitution &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \sigma =  \theta \circ \lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

In the following we discuss an algorithm for computing most general
unifiers. For this we assume a set of terms   &lt;math&gt; \{t_1, \cdots,
t_n\}&lt;/math&gt; to be unified. First we transform this into a set of equations
by introducing a new variable not yet occurring in this set, say &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; 
and by defining the set of equations
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;N = \{ y = t_1, \cdots , y = t_n\} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We will now transform this set such that its unifiers stay invariant,
where a &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a unifier of a set of &lt;math&gt; \{s_1 = t_1, \cdots , s_n =
t_n\}&lt;/math&gt; if  &lt;math&gt; \{s_1 \sigma = t_1 \sigma , \cdots , s_n\sigma  =
t_n\sigma \}&lt;/math&gt; holds.

{{Box| &lt;center&gt;'''Unification'''&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Given a set of expression. Transform it into a set of equations &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;
as defined above. Apply the following transformation rules as long as
possible: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

#&lt;math&gt;\frac {R \uplus \{t=x\}}{R \uplus \{x=t\}}&lt;/math&gt;  ''Orient'' &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a variable and  &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; a non-variable term   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{R \uplus \{s=s\}}{R}&lt;/math&gt; ''Delete'' &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    
# &lt;math&gt;\frac{R \uplus \{f(s_1,\dots, s_n) = f(t_1, \dots, t_n)\}}{R \uplus \{s_1=t_1, \dots, s_n=t_n\}} &lt;/math&gt; ''Decompose ''(Termreduction)   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\frac{R \uplus \{x=t\}}{R[x/t] \uplus \{x=t\}}&lt;/math&gt; ''Eliminate'' (Elimination of variable I)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  if  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; not in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, but in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; \frac{R \uplus \{x=y\}}{R[x/y] \uplus \{x=y\}}&lt;/math&gt;''Coalesce'' (Elimination of variable II)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x \neq y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \frac{R \uplus \{f(s_1, \dots, s_m) = g(t_1,\dots, t_n)\}}{\mbox{FAIL}}&lt;/math&gt; ''Conflict''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   if &lt;math&gt;f \neq g&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;m \neq n&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{R \uplus \{x=t\}}{\mbox{FAIL}}&lt;/math&gt;  ''Occur Check'' &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; }}

==Theorem 7==
Let &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; be a set of expressions. The above unification algorithm
terminates. If it returns &lt;math&gt;FAIL&lt;/math&gt;, there is no unifier for &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise 
&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;  is transformed into a set of equation  &lt;math&gt;\{y_1 = u_1, \cdots , y_m 
= u_m\}&lt;/math&gt;, which represents the most general unifier for &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition 22==
Let two or more literals of a clause &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; have a unifier &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, then 
&lt;math&gt;C\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is called a factor of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Example: &lt;br&gt;
With &lt;math&gt; C= \{p(x), p(f(y)), \lnot q(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \{ x/f(y)\}&lt;/math&gt; we 
get the factor &lt;math&gt;C\sigma = \{p(f(y)), \lnot q(f(y))\}&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition 23==
Let &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; be two clauses with no variables in common, such
that &lt;math&gt;L_1 \in C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_2 \in C_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; have a most
general unifier &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. A binary resolvent of &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; is 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; (C_1\sigma - L_1\sigma) \cup (C_2 \sigma - L_2\sigma) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Example:
Given  &lt;math&gt;C_1 = \{ p(x), q(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2 = \{\lnot p(a),r(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;. After
renaming &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;C_2 = \{\lnot p(a), r(y)\}&lt;/math&gt; we get the resolvent 
&lt;math&gt;\{q(a), r(y)\}&lt;/math&gt; by using the most general unifier &lt;math&gt;\{x/a\} &lt;/math&gt;. 


We often depict resolvent graphically, e.g.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:resolvent.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

==Definition 24==
A resolvent of two clauses &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; is one of the
following binary resolvents:
  
*a binary resolvent of &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; 
*a binary resolvent of &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and a factor of &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; 
*a binary resolvent of a factor of &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; 
*a binary resolvent of a factor of &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and a factor of  &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Given  &lt;math&gt;C_1 = \{ p(x), p(f(y)), r(g(y))\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2 = \{\lnot
p(f(g(a))),q(b)\}&lt;/math&gt;.

A factor of &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;C_1\prime = \{p(f(y)), r(g(y))\}&lt;/math&gt;.  A binary
resolvent of &lt;math&gt;C_1\prime&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; and hence also of &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;C_3 = \{ r(g(g(a))), q(b)\} &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The following lemma is used in the completeness proof of resolution.

==Lemma 5 (Lifting lemma)==
If &lt;math&gt;C_1\prime&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2\prime&lt;/math&gt; are instances of &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;,
respectively, and &lt;math&gt;C\prime&lt;/math&gt; is a resolvent  of  &lt;math&gt;C_1\prime&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2\prime&lt;/math&gt;, 
then there is a resolvent &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of  &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt;C\prime&lt;/math&gt; is an instance of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;

==Theorem 8==
A set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of clauses is unsatisfiable iff the empty clause can be
derived from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; by resolution.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Proof:'''&lt;br&gt;
Assume that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable. Let &lt;math&gt;A = \{ A_1,A_2, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt; be
the ground atom set of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, hence the Herbrand basis. Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a
complete binary tree, as given in Figure 2. According to Herbrand's theorem
(version1)  there exists a closed finite semantic tree
&lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt;. There are two cases:
  
*If &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; consists only of one node (hence the root), The interpretation to be collected from the empty branch in this tree falsifies only the empty clause. Hence the empty clause must be in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. 
*Assume &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; consists of more than one node. Then there must be an inference node &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt;, hence both its descendants   &lt;math&gt;N_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N_2&lt;/math&gt; are failure nodes. If such a node would not exist, every node would have at least one non-failure node, which would mean that there is at least an infinite path in &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt;, which   would violate, that fact that it is a finite closed semantic tree.   Let &lt;math&gt;N, N_1, N_2&lt;/math&gt; given as described above; and let &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  I(N) &amp; =&amp; \{m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n\} 
   I(N_1) &amp; =&amp; \{m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n, m_n, m_{n+1}\} 
  I(N_2) &amp;  =&amp;  \{m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n, m_n, \lnot m_{n+1}\} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Now, let &lt;math&gt;C_1'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2'&lt;/math&gt; be ground instances of clauses &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;, such that  &lt;math&gt;C_1'&lt;/math&gt; is falsified by &lt;math&gt;I(N_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2'&lt;/math&gt;  by &lt;math&gt;I(N_2)&lt;/math&gt;, such that both are not falsified by &lt;math&gt;I(N)&lt;/math&gt;.
 Hence we have &lt;math&gt;\lnot m_{n+1} \in C_1'&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; m_{n+1} \in C_2'&lt;/math&gt; and we can construct the resolvent &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
C' = (C_1' - \{ \lnot m_{n+1}\} ) \cup (C_2' - \{  m_{n+1}\} ) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; must be false in &lt;math&gt;I(N)&lt;/math&gt;, because both &lt;math&gt;(C_1' - \lnot m_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(C_2' -  m_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt; are false in &lt;math&gt;I(N)&lt;/math&gt;. According to the Lifting Lemma 5 there exists a resolvent &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of  &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; is a ground instance of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;T \; '' &lt;/math&gt; be the closed semantic tree for &lt;math&gt; S \cup \{ C\} &lt;/math&gt; , obtained from &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; by deleting all nodes below the first node which falsifies &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt;. Note, that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable if and only if &lt;math&gt;S \cup \{ C\} &lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable. Clearly, &lt;math&gt;T \; ''&lt;/math&gt; has less nodes than &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; and we now can iterate this process until only the root of the semantic tree is remaining. This, however is only possible if the empty clause &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; is derivable. 
For the opposite direction, assume that  &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; is derivable by
resolution from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;R_1, \ldots, R_k&lt;/math&gt; the resolvents
constructed during this process. Assume &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable and
&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to be a model for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. From the correctness lemma according to
the propositional case we known, that if a model satisfies two
clauses it also satisfies its resolvent. Therefore &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; has to satisfy
&lt;math&gt;R1, \ldots, R_k&lt;/math&gt;; this, however, is impossible, because one of this
resolvents is &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Molarity versus Molality==
*Molarity (M) - moles of solute per liter of solution.
*Molality (m) - moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.

==Solubility Rules==
These will NOT be given to you on the test. You must memorize them.
# Compounds with Group 1 elements are soluble or the ammonium ion are soluble.
# Nitrates, acetates, chlorates, and perchlorates are soluble.
# Chlorides, bromides, and iodides are generally soluble, unless they contain copper, silver, lead, or mercury.
# Sulfates are soluble, unless they contain barium, lead, silver, strontium, or calcium.
# Most silver salts are insoluble unless listed in rule #2.
# Most hydroxide salts are insoluble unless stated in rule #1 or contain calcium, strontium, or barium.
# Most sulfides are insoluble unless stated in rule #1, or contain Group 2 elements.
# Carbonates and phosphates are insoluble unless listed in rule #1.

==Forgot Your Polyatomic Ions?==
*Ammonium - NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
*Nitrate - NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
*Acetate - CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
*Chlorate - ClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
*Perchlorate - ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
*Sulfate - SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;
*Carbonate - CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;
*Phosphate - PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;

==Solubility==
*Solids are more soluble when they are warm, but gases are the opposite.
*Supersaturated solutions will settle if disturbed.

==Colligative Properties==
Colligative properties are properties of solutions that depend on the amount of solute particles present rather than the identity of the particles.
*Vapor pressure lowering
*Freezing point depression and boiling point elevation (molality)
*Osmotic pressure

==Not Solutions==
*Colloids look &quot;milky&quot; when light is passed through them (Tyndall Effect)
*Suspensions settle if left long enough, and also look milky.

      <text xml:space="preserve">*Reactants form products.
*Reactions may be exothermic (releasing heat) or endothermic (absorbing heat).

==Types of Reactions==
*Synthesis: A + B → AB
*Decomposition: AB → A + B
*Single Replacement: AB + C → AC + B.
*Double Replacement: AB + CD → AD + CB.
**Precipitation - when two ionic compounds are dissolved in a solvent, they form four ions. Quite often, the positive ion from one compound will react with the negative ion from the other, forming an insoluble compound. This compound precipitates to the bottom as a solid.
**Neutralization - when an acid and base are mixed, water and a '''salt''' will form.

===Redox Reactions===
These are reactions where the oxidation numbers of particles change. The particle whose oxidation number decreases is '''reduced''', and is called an '''oxidizing agent'''. The other particle is '''oxidized''', and is called a '''reducing agent'''. If oxygen is the ''oxidizing'' agent, the reaction is called combustion.

===Predicting Chemical Reactions===
{{:General Chemistry/Predicting Chemical Reactions}}

==Kinetics==
*Rate constant - constant only for a specific reaction and temperature.
*Order of a reaction - add up all the exponents of the molarities.

==Polyprotic Acids==
Can donate more than one hydrogen ion. (Bronsted-Lowry)

==Titration==
Titration is the combining of a known concentration solution with an unknown concentration solution. The titration is stopped at the '''equivalence point''', where all of the acid or base has been reacted. Polyprotic acids have more than one equivalence point.

==Conjugate Acids and Bases==
Conjugates differ by one hydrogen ion. Strong acids have weak base conjugates, and vice versa.

==Water Dissociation Constant==
K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; = [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;][OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = 10^-14 at 298K.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About SDL Trados==
SDL TRADOS is CAT translation software, widely used by corporate language departments, language service providers, freelance translators and academic institutions. As other CAT tools, SDL Trados is designed to increase efficiency and quality during translation and localization. Probably the most frequently used components of a CAT tool are:

Translation memory: A linguistic database that records your translations as you work, then displays past translations when the same or similar source material appears again.

Terminology management: Essentially a dictionary that can be referenced on the fly while working

==SDL Trados 2007==
SDL Trados 2007 adds a new component, Synergy, which provides means to keep track of multiple files with the memory and terminology database. 

As with any CAT tool, there are frequent complaints about bugs and failures in this software. User groups are available to seek help to problems, and SDL Trados provides a fee-based support system (also the target of many complaints).

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the chapter 1 of the Disaster and WMD defence guide and its subject is Nuclear &amp; Radiation protection.

=Protection from an imminent strike=
The only thing you can do to protect your self from a strike about to occur is either to quickly go to a [[wikipedia: civil protection|CP]] shelter or to go as low underground as you can and stay near a wall to prevent being buried by a possible collapse of your roof etc.

==Protection from a possible attack==
First try to get at least 50km (40mi)

===Aftermath===

      <text xml:space="preserve">You should primaly take shelter in a [[wikipedia:Civil protection|CP]] shelter. If you don't have this option, in case of nuclear leak take cover in an under ground cellar space or in case of a gas leak you should (depending on the gas) take cover in the top floor (don't go to the attic, because attics usually present a lot of &quot;blocking&quot; which will be handled later,

==Radioactivity weakens==
When it goes through material
For example 35cm (14inches) of concrete reduces the radiation levels to 1:50

When the distance to the radiating particles grows,

* !Radio, TV or a Computer! A radio is the best because it's got a simple broadcasting system which is easier to have back up and running after any type of situation. Stay on government channels to receive more accurate info.

* =Important medication and Important documents=
* Eating utilities, Plates, forks etc.
* Matches Don't use unless you absolutely need to because they &quot;eat&quot; oxygen

'''Adrenocortical Carcinoma'''

==Overview==
*Rare tumors
**Incidence 1 per 1,000,000
**Represent 0.2% of all cancers
**Up to 14% of adrenal incidentalomas
*Located in the adrenal cortex
*Produce steroids ~50% cases
*Equal in men:women
*Often associated with [[Handbook_of_Genetic_Counseling/Beckwith-Wiedemann_Syndrome|Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome]]
*May be part of MEN I (hyperparathyroidism, endocrine pancreas tumors, pituitary adenomas, adrenal tumors, neuroendocrine tumors)


*'''UCSF, 2006''' PMID 16680602 -- &quot;Extent of disease at presentation and outcome for adrenocortical carcinoma: have we made progress?&quot; (Kebebew E, World J Surg. 2006 May;30(5):872-8.)
**SEER database review 1973-2000
**Average age 51.2, 46% men, average tumor size 12 cm (only 4% &lt;6cm)
**Treatment: 88% surgical resection, EBRT used in 12%
**Prognostic factors: low tumor grade, low stage, surgical resection
**Conclusion: no change in presentation, diagnosis, stage over time

==Staging==
*Tumor (T)
**T1: Tumor 5 cm or less in size; invasion absent
**T2: Tumor greater than 5 cm in size; invasion absent
**T3: Tumor outside adrenal in fat
**T4: Tumor invading adjacent organs

*Lymph nodes (N)
**N0: No positive lymph nodes
**N1: Positive lymph nodes

*Metastases (M)
** M0: No distant metastases
** M1: Distant metastases

==Treatment==
*Surgical
*Adjuvant mitotane
*Use of RT controversial
*Perez 4th Edition:
**Consider RT: preop in unresectable to downstage, postop with residual disease, postop with high risk features, primary RT for nonsurgical candidates, palliative
**Dose 50-60 Gy to tumor/tumor bed, nodal drainage including contralateral periaortics
**Shielding of contralateral kidney


*'''Italy/Germany, 2007''' (1985-2005) PMID 17554118 -- &quot;Adjuvant Mitotane Treatment for Adrenocortical Carcinoma.&quot; (Terzolo M, N Engl J Med. 2007 Jun 7;356(23):2372-2380.)
**Retrospective. 177 patients at 8 centers in Italy and 47 centers in Germany. Radical surgery. Adjuvant mitotane in 47 Italian patients vs. no further treatment in 55 Italian and 75 German patients. Italian patients similar, German older and more Stage I-II
**Outcome: RFS mitotane 42 months vs. Italian control 10 months vs. German control 25 months
**Conclusion: Adjuvant mitotane may prolong recurrence-free survival
**Editorial: While retrospective, well done, and provides compelling rationale for adjuvant low-dose mitotane

**Retrospective. 13 patients treated in 2 hospitals, 6 patients with primary/adjuvant RT
**Conclusion: Postop RT may have improved survival

**Retrospective. 15 patients, 9 post op RT 
**Outcome: 10-year OS 33%
**Prognostic: age at diagnosis, hormone production, complete resection

*'''Michigan, 2011''' (1989-2008) PMID 20675074 -- &quot;Adjuvant and definitive radiotherapy for adrenocortical carcinoma.&quot; (Sabolch A, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2011 Aug 1;80(5):1477-84.)
**Retrospective. 58 patients, 10 post op RT 
**Outcome: Lack of radiotherapy use was associated with 4.7 times the risk of local failure compared with treatment regimens that involved radiotherapy
**Conclusion: Adjuvant radiotherapy should be strongly considered after surgical resection.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Mediastinum_anatomy.jpg|thumb|right|385px|The heart and lungs and surrounding arteries and veins.]]  The job of the circulatory system is to provide [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#oxygen|oxygen]] and [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#nutrient|nutrients]] to all the parts of the body. Waste products like [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide]] are carried away so they can leave the body. 

__TOC__

==What does the circulatory system look like?==

The heart is about the size of a fist. The blood vessels are long, thin tubes that carry blood. There are thousands of blood vessels. If you stretched them all out, one person's blood vessels would cover over 60,000 miles!

==What are the parts of the circulatory system?==

The [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#circulatory|circulatory]] system includes the heart, blood, and blood vessels. Blood vessels are the tubes that carry blood all over the body. 
[[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#artery|Arteries]], [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#vein|veins]], and [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#capillary|capillaries ]] are all different kinds of blood vessels.
It also includes the lymphatic system, which comprises a network of conduits called lymphatic vessels that carry a clear fluid called lymph ''unidirectionally'' towards the heart.

==What is the function of the circulatory system?==

The job of the circulatory system is to carry oxygen and nutrients from food to all the parts of the body. Then waste products like carbon dioxide are carried back out. This is all done by the blood which travels through the blood vessels. The job of the heart is to pump the blood all over the body.

The circulatory system is very important. Without it, the rest of the body would die.

==How does the circulatory system interact with other parts of the body?==

All the parts of your body need a supply of blood. This red sticky liquid carries food and oxygen to every part of your body. The heart and its network of blood vessels are called the circulatory system. The artery that carries oxygen rich blood cells away from your heart is called the aorta and the vein that takes it back again is called the vena cava.

Your heart is made of two pumps. The left pump or left ventricle receives blood filled with oxygen from your lungs and sends it around your body. The right pump or right ventricle gets blood from the body and sends it to the lungs to pick up some more oxygen. The inside walls of your heart squeeze regularly to pump the blood around your body. This is called the heart beat.

In your body you have one way valves in your main veins and in your heart. They make your blood flow the right way around your body. If your blood tries to go the other way the valve will snap shut so your blood can’t get through.

Your arteries have thick walls to cope with the high pressure of the blood from your heart. They branch out to make a network of very small blood vessels called capillaries. Many substances can pass through the walls. Not only oxygen passes from blood to nearby cells but carbon dioxide and other waste matter passes into the capillary to be carried away.

Your blood is made up of four things. About half of your blood is made up of plasma, about 40% is made of red blood cells which carry oxygen and a very little bit is made of white blood cells and platelets. Plasma is a pale yellow liquid. It is made up of sugars, salts and other body chemicals. Red blood cells are donut shaped which carries oxygen around the body. The blood gets its red colour from these cells. Hemoglobin I your red blood cells are the red I it. The amount of oxygen in the blood cell determines how red the cell is. White blood cells go around the body looking for germs to eat. They are like jelly filled bags and can change their shape to get out of the blood stream and go into other body parts. Platelets help you clot your blood if you prick yourself or get a bruise. They are made in bone marrow and are round or oval in shape.

In models or diagrams oxygen rich blood is shown red and veins carrying old blood are shown in blue when it is actually a darker red.

==How can you keep your the circulatory system healthy?==

Regular [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#exercise|exercise]] and eating healthy food helps keep the heart healthy. Sometimes, the circulatory system has problems like high blood pressure or high [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#cholesterol|cholesterol]]. Diet, exercise, and sometimes [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#medication|medication]] can help those problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We need a good illustration here (the classic red arteries and blue veins image). I had a hard time finding one that didn't have prominent male anatomy that we should probably avoid in a little kids' book. If anyone can help find something for this, that would be great.

:How's that? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:50, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

I'd like to say that thie illustration that is already there is perfect, but someone should 
add labels to the picture. They should say something like: main ateries, red blood cells, heart, and anything else we can think of. Tell me your suggestions!</text>

==CSI RT Dose==
*'''POG 8631/CCG 923''' (1986-1990) -- '''CSI 36 Gy vs. CSI 23.4 Gy'''
**2000, PMID 10944134 -- &quot;Low-stage medulloblastoma: final analysis of trial comparing standard-dose with reduced-dose neuraxis irradiation.&quot; (Thomas PR, J Clin Oncol. 2000 Aug;18(16):3004-11.)
**Randomized. 126 patients, low risk (&gt;3 years, complete resection T1-T2, later also T3a, M0) standard CSI 36(20*1.8) vs. reduced CSI 23.4(13*1.8); both followed by posterior fossa boost to 54(30*1.8) Gy. ''Study closed prematurely due to high relapse in reduced arm''
**5-year EFS: standard CSI 67% vs. reduced CSI 52% (p=0.080)&lt;br&gt;8-year EFS: standard CSI 67% vs. reduced CSI 52% (p=0.141)&lt;br&gt;''These data confirm the original one-sided conclusions but suggest that differences are less marked with time''
**Conclusion: Reduced CSI 23.4 Gy alone is insufficient; may need concurrent chemo

*'''SIOP II''' (1984-1989) -- '''CSI 35 Gy vs. CSI 25 Gy; also +/- adjuvant chemo'''
**1995, PMID 7623725 &quot;Prospective randomised trial of chemotherapy given before radiotherapy in childhood medulloblastoma. International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) and the (German) Society of Paediatric Oncology (GPO)&quot;  Bailey et al.  Med Pediatr Onc 25(3):166-78, 1995
**Randomized. 364 patients. SIOP I low risk (total/subtotal resection, no brain stem invasion, M0) randomized to +/- adjuvant chemo (vincristine, methotrexate, procarbazine), and then randomized to standard CSI 35 Gy vs. reduced CSI 25 Gy. Boost posterior fossa to 55 Gy. High risk randomized to +/- adjuvant chemo, then standard CSI and additional post-RT chemo 
**Outcome: No advantage to pre-RT chemo. Standard CSI 35 Gy for low risk pts increased EFS (68% vs 55%). Low risk patients with adjuvant chemo and CSI 25 Gy did particularly badly
**Conclusion: No benefit to adjuvant chemo. Standard dose of CSI is 35 Gy

==CSI +/- Chemo==
*'''CCG A9961''' (1996-2000) -- '''CSI 23.4 Gy + CCNU-based vs. cyclophosphamide-based chemo'''
**2006, PMID 16943538 &quot;Phase III study of craniospinal radiation therapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for newly diagnosed average-risk medulloblastoma&quot;  Packer et al.  JCO 24(25):4204-8, 2006.
**Randomized. 421 patients, standard risk. Treated  with reduced dose RT (23.4 Gy CSI + 55.8 Gy to posterior fossa) and concurrent vincristine, and randomized to either:  1) CCNU, cisplatin and vincristine or 2) cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, vincristine. Median F/U 5 years
**5-year outcome: EFS 81%, OS 86%. No difference by chemo arm  
**Prognostic factors: anaplasia OS 75% vs. 89% (SS)
**Relapse: posterior fossa alone 32%, disseminated alone 40%, PF+disseminated 25%
**Toxicity: 25% with delayed onset mutism, hypotonia, cerebellar deficits, supranuclear CN deficits, extreme irritability, and/or emotional lability. ~50% residual deficits at 1 year
**Conclusion: Reduced dose CSI with chemo can be done safely to avoid toxicities of higher dose RT. No difference between chemo arms

*'''PNET 3''' (1992-2000) -- '''CSI 35 Gy +/- neoadjuvant chemo'''
**2003, PMID 12697884 -- &quot;Results of a randomized study of preradiation chemotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for nonmetastatic medulloblastoma: The International Society of Paediatric Oncology/United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group PNET-3 Study.&quot; (Taylor RE, J Clin Oncol. 2003 Apr 15;21(8):1581-91.)
**Randomized. 179/217 standard risk patients (including M1). Treated with neoadjuvant chemo (vincristine/etoposide/carboplatin/cyclophosphamide) vs. RT alone (CSI 35 Gy + 20 Gy posterior fossa boost). Median F/U 5.4 years. ''Study closed early due to lack of accrual in RT alone arm''
**5-year outcome: OS 70% (NS), EFS chemo-RT 74% vs. RT alone 60% (SS)
**Conclusion: improved EFS with addition of chemo, no impact on survival

*'''SIOP II''' (1984-1989) -- '''CSI 35 Gy vs. CSI 25 Gy; also +/- adjuvant chemo'''
**1995, PMID 7623725 &quot;Prospective randomised trial of chemotherapy given before radiotherapy in childhood medulloblastoma. International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) and the (German) Society of Paediatric Oncology (GPO)&quot;  Bailey et al.  Med Pediatr Onc 25(3):166-78, 1995
**Randomized. 364 patients. SIOP I low risk (total/subtotal resection, no brain stem invasion, M0) randomized to +/- adjuvant chemo (vincristine, methotrexate, procarbazine), and then randomized to standard CSI 35 Gy vs. reduced CSI 25 Gy. Boost posterior fossa to 55 Gy. High risk randomized to +/- adjuvant chemo, then standard CSI and additional post-RT chemo 
**Outcome: No advantage to pre-RT chemo. Standard CSI 35 Gy for low risk pts increased EFS (68% vs 55%). Low risk patients with adjuvant chemo and CSI 25 Gy did particularly badly
**Conclusion: No benefit to adjuvant chemo. Standard dose of CSI is 35 Gy

*'''SIOP I''' -- '''CSI +/- adjuvant chemo'''
**1990, PMID 2141512 -- &quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy for medulloblastoma: the first multi-centre control trial of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP I).&quot; (Tait DM, Eur J Cancer. 1990 Apr;26(4):464-9.)
**Randomized. 286 patients, 15 countries. Treated with CSI, randomized to +/- chemo (concurrent vincristine, then CCNU/vincristine maintenance)
**Survival: 5-year 53%, 10-year 45%. No difference between arms
**Subgroup benefit: subtotal surgery, brainstem involvement, T3-T4 disease
**Conclusion: No difference, but subgroup benefit

*'''CCG 942''' -- '''CSI +/- adjuvant chemo'''
**1990, PMID 2319316 -- &quot;The treatment of medulloblastoma. Results of a prospective randomized trial of radiation therapy with and without CCNU, vincristine, and prednisone.&quot; (Evans AE, J Neurosurg. 1990 Apr;72(4):572-82.)
**Randomized. 233 patients. CSI +/- chemo (CCNU, vincristine, prednisone)
**5-year outcomes: EFS chemo-RT 59% vs. RT alone 50% (NS); OS 65% for both (NS)
**Subgroup benefit: large tumors (EFS chemo-RT 48% vs. RT alone 0%)
**Conclusion: no benefit for chemo in low stage, subgroup benefit for advanced stage

==CSI + adjuvant chemo alternatives==
*'''CCG 921''' (1986-1992) -- vincristine/lomustine/prednisone (VCP) vs. 8-in-1
**Randomized. 427 children &lt;21 years, with medulloblastoma, pineoblastoma, ependymoblastoma, central neuroblastoma, PNET, or malignant ependymoma, with unfavorable features. For ST-PNET required M+ staging. Children age &gt;1.5 years (n=328) received post-op CSI with Arm A) vincristine, lomustine, prednisone vs. Arm B) ''8-in-1'' (cisplatin, procarbazine, lomustine, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, methylprednisolone, hydroxyurea, cytarabine). RT: age &gt;3 received CSI 36 Gy, boost to 50.4-54 Gy spine mets and 54 Gy primary brain site; age &lt;3 received CSI 23.4 Gy with boost to 45 Gy. Children age &lt;1.5 years (n=99) were not randomized and received only Arm B
**'''1999''' PMID 10071274 -- &quot;Metastasis stage, adjuvant treatment, and residual tumor are prognostic factors for medulloblastoma in children: conclusions from the Children's Cancer Group 921 randomized phase III study.&quot; (Zeltzer PM, J Clin Oncol. 1999 Mar;17(3):832-45.) Median F/U 7.0 years
***Subset analysis. 203 patients with medulloblastoma. Median OS 8-in-1 55% vs. VCP 54% (NS); PFS 63% vs. 45% (SS)
***Prognostic factors: age &lt;3 (who received lower CSI dose); if &gt;3 y/o then M stage (PFS M0 70% vs. M1 57% vs. M2+ 40%, SS); if M0 tumors, then residual (PFS &lt;1.5 cm2 78% vs. &gt;1.5 cm2 54%)
***Conclusion: VCP + XRT superior; if &lt;3 years (with reduced RT) had lowest survival

==Pre-RT chemo vs. Post-RT chemo==
*'''German HIT 91''' (1991-97) -- '''Chemo x2 cycles -&gt;RT vs. RT -&gt; chemo x8 cycles'''
**Trial enrolled pts with supratentorial PNET, medulloblastoma, and anaplastic ependymomas. All treated with extensive resection. In HIT 88/89, pts treated  In HIT 91, randomized to 1) chemo x2 cycles (Ifosfamide, etoposide, MTX, cisplatin, cytarabine) -&gt; RT (CSI 35.2 Gy + PF boost 20 Gy) or 2) immediate RT (35.2 + 20) followed by maintenance chemo x8 cycles (CCNU, cisplatin, vincristine).
**Medullo subset, 2000 PMID 10661332 -- &quot;Postoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy before radiotherapy as compared to immediate radiotherapy followed by maintenance chemotherapy in the treatment of medulloblastoma in childhood: results of the German prospective randomized trial HIT '91.&quot; (Kortmann RD, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 Jan 15;46(2):269-79.)
***Subset report of 158 medulloblastoma patients (137 randomized). Median F/U 2.5 years
***3-year outcome: RFS RT-&gt;chemo 78% vs. chemo-&gt;RT 65% (SS), but no difference if age 3-6 years
***Negative prognosis: M2/3 disease, age &lt;8 years. M1 not a bad prognostic factor
**Conclusion: RT upfront with maintenance chemo more effective. Neoadjuvant chemo caused higher RT myelotoxicity, and more RT interruptions</text>

=== Stems ===
In Gothic, like in many, if not all languages, words will change stems to show their meaning. '''Stems''' are sounds added to the ends of a root word to denote what the word really means. For example:
* The stem of '''gifted''' is '''ed''' and the root is '''gift'''. '''ed''' denotes that the action happened in the past.
* The stem of '''precaution''' is '''pre''' and the root is '''caution'''. '''pre''' denotes that this word is before an action.
* The stem of '''lemony''' is '''y''' and the root is '''lemon'''. '''y''' denotes that the word it is describing is similar to the root.
Now that you get the gist of what stems are, you are ready to learn the Gothic stems. The stems used by Gothic are probably larger than in Modern English. They are based on the gender given to an object, their strength, and their case in basis. 

=== The Gothic Stems ===
In Gothic, stems are used mostly to simply describe the case of a word and whether it is masculine, feminine, or neuter in nature. Here are the stems in Gothic. They are all '''suffixes''', or stems that will got on the end of a root rather than the front.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One can prepare most herbal remedies by infusion.  The infusion method involves preparing herbs by placing 1 to 2 teaspoons of dried herb or 2 to 4 fresh herbs in oil or water for approximately ten minutes, then straining.  Waiting too long before straining results in bitter tasting herbs.  People typically prepare teas and herbal teas by infusion.

Long term infusions involve leaving the herbs in the solute for at least one year.  Long term infusions result in highly concentrated solutions similar to essential oils.  Because of their concentration, users of long-term infusions must take greater care with overdose concerns; long term infusions do not function as teas.

==Presentation==

With the Finger Stretching check, you grip a finger firmly, and try to elongate it by pulling. If it stretches, you're dreaming.

See [[Talk:Lucid Dreaming: Reality Checks: Finger Stretching]] for a discussion of this reality check's effectiveness.

==Examples of this reality check working==

* I thought to myself &quot;If I am dreaming, then my finger will stretch if I tug on it hard.&quot;.  I did, and I became lucid.

==Examples of this reality check failing==

* This has yet to fail for the first editor of this article.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== WHNF picture ==

Hi David,

Just thought I might suggest making the WHNF picture correspond to the example, if possible.  Best, -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:26, 9 June 2007 (UTC)
:To add to that, boy am I looking forward to this chapter!  I've always had a vague and imprecise understanding about laziness (&quot;sum'ing about thunks&quot;) and would love to be more comfortable with the idea -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:17, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

: The reason I didn't do that is because there would be too many stages of evaluation for (length [1..5], reverse &quot;olleh&quot;). It'd go something like this:

 thunk
 (thunk, thunk)
 (length thunk, thunk)
 (length (1:thunk), thunk)
 (1 + length thunk, thunk)
 (1 + length (2:thunk), thunk)
 (1 + 1 + length thunk, thunk)
 (1 + 1 + length (3:thunk), thunk)
 (1 + 1 + 1 + length thunk, thunk)
 (1 + 1 + 1 + length (4:thunk), thunk)
 (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + length thunk, thunk)
 (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, thunk)
 (5, thunk)
 (5, reverse thunk)
 (5, reverse ('o':thunk))
 (5, reverse thunk ++ [o])
 (5, reverse ('l':thunk) ++ [o])
 (5, reverse thunk ++ [l] ++ [o])
 (5, reverse ('l':thunk) ++ [l] ++ [o])
 (5, reverse thunk ++ [l] ++ [l] ++ [o])
 (5, reverse ('e':thunk) ++ [l] ++ [l] ++ [o])
 (5, reverse thunk ++ [e] ++ [l] ++ [l] ++ [o])
 (5, reverse ('h':thunk) ++ [e] ++ [l] ++ [l] ++ [o])
 (5, reverse thunk ++ [h] ++ [e] ++ [l] ++ [l] ++ [o])
 (5, reverse [] ++ [h] ++ [e] ++ [l] ++ [l] ++ [o])
 (5, [] ++ [h] ++ [e] ++ [l] ++ [l] ++ [o])
 (5, &quot;hello&quot;)

And even that's skipping the definitions of (+) and (++). Something like that could feasibly go into the article proper, though, what do you think? [[User:DavidHouse|DavidHouse]] 10:04, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:Ouch.  What if we used a shorter example, something like &lt;code&gt;(reverse &quot;hi&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;?  Also, it might be helpful to have the implementation of reverse somewhere in a sidebox maybe (don't know if that would just be distracting).  But yeah, it would probably be useful to have an example worked out in the main text.  It's also more accessible to people who can't see the graphics -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:02, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

== Introduction ==

I thought it would be useful to start out with a quick motivation section, not a lot of blah blah but just enough to drive home the point that laziness is more about writing nice code than it is about writing efficient code (as far as I understand).  I would like to have a very simple, minimal &quot;obvious&quot; example without a lot of explanation.  I thought maybe we could lay that example down, not explain it too much, and then add a transition like &quot;so let's see what makes this tick&quot; -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:37, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:I'm somewhat unsatisfied with my ''it makes the right things '''efficient enough''''' because it doesn't capture the idea of making circular code possible in the first place.  I wonder if there is a better way to phrase this -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:11, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

== What is strict/lazy ==

Following the introduction, I was thinking that a sort of shallow bullet-pointed overview of laziness and strictness might be helpful, something like:

* data structures are lazy
* functions are lazy wrt their arguments
* pattern matching, however, is strict

Not everything in a lazy language can be lazy, otherwise nothing would ever get done!  Somewhere in the language, we need to have something to force things to get evaluated.  In Haskell, the thing which forces evaluation is pattern matching. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 08:01, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

: True. I'll add something like this in to the first section. [[User:DavidHouse|DavidHouse]] 09:55, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

== Possible split ==
I've thought about splitting this article into two sections, one that explains the theory behind lazy evaluation and one that will probably get merged with the Strictness article and can talk about the performance implications of laziness. Thoughs? [[User:DavidHouse|DavidHouse]] 10:06, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:Well, that sounds like a good idea.  On the other hand, there is this point that making code lazier can sometimes result in performance gains (but i guess that could appear in the Strictness chapter too).  I would say that if you're going to split the article, trying moving them directly to Strictness first.  But otherwise, maybe it's best to just leave those bits as stub and see how the situation clarifies itself as the rest of the article gets written -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:05, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:: Well, yeah, the idea was to have a &quot;Laziness and nonstrictness&quot; section where we explore why it's important to have nonstrict semantics in Haskell (the kinds of things that are going into your introduction, easier to write concise code, don't have to worry about execution order etc., ''brief'' mention of performance gains) and how this is implemented (explain laziness in terms of thunks), then have a different chapter where we look at the performance implications of nonstrictness and cover way to make your program more strict and ways to make it lazier, and when either is beneficial. [[User:DavidHouse|DavidHouse]] 11:34, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:::* Splitting sounds good. I originally intended that the chapter [[Haskell/Graph reduction]] covers how functional programs are evaluated at all, i.e. what the different normal forms are and how lazy and eager evaluation work. So, the basic question is &quot;How to evaluate an expression?&quot;. It really helps to do several reductions by hand on a piece of paper. Maybe the chapter name is too special, something like [[Haskell/Evaluating Functional Programs]] would be more fitting. Mixing _|_ into the reduction strategy discussion is more confusing than helpful, because it has to be mentioned over and over again. But I think it can be put in a separate extra section &quot;Approximating Reduction with Denotational Semantics&quot; or something like that. Basic cheat: assume that Haskell has lazy evaluation but don't mention this false claim :-)
:::* The plan for [[Haskell/Laziness]] was to showcase the benefits and power of lazy evaluation. There are some points to make: formulating algorithms compositionally without damaging asymptotic time complexity, create your own control structures, infinite data structures, tying knots, memoization. Reasoning about space and time complexity is needed a bit, but detailed methods (from Okasaki's book) are probably best left to a data structure chapter. This means that this chapter should not explain what lazy evaluation is, that has to be done in [[Haskell/Graph reduction]].
:::* For [[Haskell/Strictness]], I had in mind that it should explain how to enforce strictness and when or when not we want that at all. So, &lt;code&gt;foldl' (+)&lt;/code&gt; is good, &lt;code&gt;foldl' (:)&lt;/code&gt; is not, why &lt;code&gt;id $! 3&lt;/code&gt; is useless, how to get a strict state monad and so on. In other words, this chapter would focus on common cases and deal with finding out what exactly gets evaluated.
:::* The plan in a sentence: [[Haskell/Graph reduction]] tells how stuff actually works, [[Haskell/Laziness]] opens your eyes and [[Haskell/Strictness]] helps with day-to-day laziness/strictess sorrows. The chapter titles may not fit, but each chapter can mention the others in the introduction to help the reader find the right one :-)

== When to use lazy pattern matching ==

The article says to use lazy pattern matching when there is only one constructor. But normally (except in the case of tuples) you can declare a type having only one constructor as a newtype, and then there's no pattern match overhead because the constructor doesn't actually exist at runtime! So it seems that it's only useful for tuples - am I wrong?--[[User:Greenrd|Greenrd]] 21:26, 21 June 2007 (UTC)

:Well, the constructor may have multiple arguments &lt;code&gt;data Stream a = S a (Stream a)&lt;/code&gt;. But of course, you can replace this with a tuple in a newtype: &lt;code&gt;newtype Stream a = S (a,Stream a)&lt;/code&gt; and lazy pattern match as in &lt;code&gt;f (S ~(x,xs)) = ...&lt;/code&gt;.
:However, lazy pattern matches are also useful with multiple constructors, namely with the &quot;blueprint technique&quot;. An intended rewrite of this chapter will incorporate a section on this. In the meantime, see also
:* [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Tying_the_Knot Haskell wiki - Tying the Knot]

:* [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/15119 Re: Quicksearch vs. lazyness]
: -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 09:52, 22 June 2007 (UTC)

Another interesting sample where lazy pattern matching is needed is shown here:
[http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/patterns.html#sect4.4 Lazy patterns]. Two mutual recursive functions are defined producing lists, which represent a couple of interacting automata (a &quot;server&quot; and a &quot;client&quot;) exchanging tokens; without lazy patterns the two agents would deadlock waiting for each other's token.

-- [[User:Blaisorblade|Blaisorblade]] ([[User talk:Blaisorblade|talk]]) 17:42, 30 December 2007 (UTC)

== let (x,y) = ... in ==

About the following quote from the text:

 let (x, y) = (length [1..5], reverse &quot;olleh&quot;) in ...
«(We'll assume that in the 'in' part, we use x and y somewhere. Otherwise, we're not forced to evaluate the let-binding at all; the right-hand side could have been undefined and it would still work if the 'in' part doesn't mention x or y. This assumption will remain for all the examples in this section.)»

I question the validity of that comment. As I understand it, the text implies that until x and y are not used, the pattern matching is not run; but a ''non-lazy'' pattern matching is used, so the right-hand side of the let binding must be evaluated, and cannot be undefined.
What is correct to say is that &quot;length [1..5]&quot; and reverse &quot;olleh&quot; could be undefined, if x and y are not used.

-- [[User:Blaisorblade|Blaisorblade]] ([[User talk:Blaisorblade|talk]]) 17:30, 30 December 2007 (UTC)

:Let bindings - as opposed to case-expressions - are always lazy, so it's indeed true that the right-hand side won't be evaluated until x or y are demanded. But the whole chapter needs a big overhaul anyway, and I plan to rewrite this example. -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 09:19, 1 February 2008 (UTC)

== isInfixOf xs [1..] ==
&lt;code&gt;isInfixOf xs [1..]&lt;/code&gt; is presented like it will terminate, even if [1..] is infinite. I think it is a mistake: it should either return True or not terminate at all. I suggest we show two examples instead: one which make an infinite list from another infinite list (like map, tail --filter isn't completely safe), and another which produce a finite result from an infinite list (like take 42, head).

Loup Vaillant (unsubscribed)

:Right, the example is not so good. Concerning this subsection, I had examples similar to John Hughes' &quot;Why functional programming matters&quot; in mind. I'll rewrite the stuff here at some point. -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 09:19, 1 February 2008 (UTC)

== &quot;Bad haskellish logic&quot; comments ==

I removed from the body of the article the accusations of rose-tinted glasses shown in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Haskell%2FLaziness&amp;diff=2315176&amp;oldid=2314420 this diff]. While that section is not, IMO, significantly misleading, I tried to account partially for the criticism by qualifying one of the claims in the first sentence. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 09:04, 1 May 2012 (UTC)</text>

\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}\right)\psi(\mathbf{r})+V(\mathbf{r})\,\psi(\mathbf{r}).
&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r})=-e^2/r,&lt;/math&gt; the potential energy of a classical electron at a distance &lt;math&gt;r=|\mathbf{r}|&lt;/math&gt; from the proton. (Only when we come to the relativistic theory will we be able to shed the last vestige of classical thinking.)
:&lt;math&gt;
E\psi(\mathbf{r})=-{\hbar^2\over2m}\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}\right)\psi(\mathbf{r})-\frac{e^2}{r}V(\mathbf{r})\,\psi(\mathbf{r}).
&lt;/math&gt;
In using this equation, we ignore (i) the influence of the electron on the proton, whose mass is some 1836 times larger than that of he electron, and (ii) the electron's spin. Since relativistic and spin effects on the measurable properties of atomic hydrogen are rather small, this non-relativistic approximation nevertheless gives excellent results.

For bound states the total energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is negative, and the Schrödinger equation has a discrete set of solutions. As it turns out, the &quot;allowed&quot; values of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; are precisely the values that Bohr obtained in 1913:
:&lt;math&gt;
E_n=-{1\over n^2}\,{\mu e^4\over2\hbar^2},\qquad n=1,2,3,\dots
&lt;/math&gt;
However, for each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; there are now &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; linearly independent solutions. (If &lt;math&gt;\psi_{1},\dots,\psi_{k}&lt;/math&gt; are independent solutions, then none of them can be written as a linear combination &lt;math&gt;\sum a_i\psi_i&lt;/math&gt; of the others.)

Solutions with different &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; correspond to different energies. What physical differences correspond to linearly independent solutions with the same &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;?

[[image: Polarcoordinates.png|right|360px]]
Using polar coordinates, one finds that all solutions for a particular value &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; are linear combinations of solutions that have the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(r,\phi,\theta)=e^{(i/\hbar)\,l_z\,\phi}\psi(r,\theta).
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;l_z&lt;/math&gt; turns out to be another ''quantized'' variable, for &lt;math&gt;e^{(i/\hbar)\,l_z\,\phi}=e^{(i/\hbar)\,l_z\,(\phi\pm2\pi)}&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;l_z=m\hbar&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;m=0,\pm1,\pm2,\dots&lt;/math&gt; In addition, &lt;math&gt;|m|&lt;/math&gt; has an upper bound, as we shall see in a moment.

Just as the factorization of &lt;math&gt;\psi(t,\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;e^{-(i/\hbar)\,E\,t}\,\psi(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; made it possible to obtain a &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;-independent Schrödinger equation, so the factorization of &lt;math&gt;\psi(r,\phi,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;e^{(i/\hbar)\,l_z\,\phi}\,\psi(r,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; makes it possible to obtain a &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;-independent Schrödinger equation. This contains another real parameter &lt;math&gt;\Lambda,&lt;/math&gt; over and above &lt;math&gt;m,&lt;/math&gt; whose &quot;allowed&quot; values are given by &lt;math&gt;l(l+1)\hbar^2,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; an integer satisfying &lt;math&gt;0\leq l\leq n-1.&lt;/math&gt; The range of possible values for &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is bounded by the inequality &lt;math&gt;|m|\leq l.&lt;/math&gt; The possible values of the ''principal quantum number'' &lt;math&gt;n,&lt;/math&gt; the ''angular momentum quantum number'' &lt;math&gt;l,&lt;/math&gt; and the so-called ''magnetic quantum number'' &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; thus are:

Each possible set of quantum numbers &lt;math&gt;n,l,m&lt;/math&gt; defines a unique wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi_{nlm}(t,\mathbf{r}),&lt;/math&gt; and together these make up a complete set of bound-state solutions (&lt;math&gt;E&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;) of the Schrödinger equation with &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r})=-e^2/r.&lt;/math&gt; The following images give an idea of the position probability distributions of the first three &lt;math&gt;l=0&lt;/math&gt; states (not to scale). Below them are the probability densities plotted against &lt;math&gt;r.&lt;/math&gt; Observe that these states have &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; nodes, all of which are spherical, that is, surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;r.&lt;/math&gt; (The nodes of a wave in three dimensions are two-dimensional surfaces. The nodes of a &quot;probability wave&quot; are the surfaces at which the sign of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; changes and, consequently, the probability density &lt;math&gt;|\psi|^2&lt;/math&gt; vanishes.)

&lt;br&gt;[[image:S states.jpg|520px]]

&lt;br&gt;Take another look at these images:

&lt;br&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Orbitals1.png|&lt;math&gt;
Image:Orbitals2.png|&lt;math&gt;
Image:Orbitals3.png|&lt;math&gt;
Image:Orbitals4.png|&lt;math&gt;
Image:Orbitals1a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{2p0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals2a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{3p0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals3a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{3d0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals4a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{4p0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals5.png|&lt;math&gt;
Image:Orbitals6.png|&lt;math&gt;
Image:Orbitals7.png|&lt;math&gt;
Image:Orbitals8.png|&lt;math&gt;
Image:Orbitals5a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{4d0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals6a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{4f0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals7a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5d0}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals8a.png|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5f0}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

&lt;br&gt;The letters s,p,d,f stand for l=0,1,2,3, respectively. (Before the quantum-mechanical origin of atomic spectral lines was understood, a distinction was made between &quot;sharp,&quot; &quot;principal,&quot; &quot;diffuse,&quot; and &quot;fundamental&quot; lines. These terms were subsequently found to correspond to the first four values that &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; can take. From &lt;math&gt;l=3&lt;/math&gt; onward the labels follows the alphabet: f,g,h...) Observe that these states display both spherical and conical nodes, the latter being surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\theta.&lt;/math&gt; (The &quot;conical&quot; node with &lt;math&gt;\theta=0&lt;/math&gt; is a horizontal plane.) These states, too, have a total of &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; nodes, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; of which are conical.

Because the &quot;waviness&quot; in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is contained in a phase factor &lt;math&gt;e^{im\phi},&lt;/math&gt; it does not show up in representations of &lt;math&gt;|\psi|^2.&lt;/math&gt; To make it visible, it is customary to replace &lt;math&gt;e^{im\phi}&lt;/math&gt; by its real part &lt;math&gt;\cos(m\phi),&lt;/math&gt; as in the following images, which do ''not'' represent probability distributions.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Orbitals1b.jpg|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{4f1}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals2b.jpg|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{4f3}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals3b.jpg|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5f1}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals4b.jpg|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5f2}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals5b.jpg|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5f3}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals6b.jpg|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5g1}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals7b.jpg|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5g2}&lt;/math&gt;
Image:Orbitals8b.jpg|&lt;math&gt;\rho_{5g3}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The total number of nodes is again &lt;math&gt;n-1,&lt;/math&gt; the total number of non-spherical nodes is again &lt;math&gt;l,&lt;/math&gt; but now there are &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; plane nodes containing the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis and &lt;math&gt;l-m&lt;/math&gt; conical nodes.

What is so special about the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis? Absolutely nothing, for the wave functions &lt;math&gt;\psi'_{nlm},&lt;/math&gt; which are defined with respect to a different axis, make up another complete set of bound-state solutions. This means that every wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi'_{nlm}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a linear combination of the functions &lt;math&gt;\psi_{nlm},&lt;/math&gt; and vice versa.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Really Quick Start=

* Checkout the Project Wonder - the ERSelenium is in the Wonder/Common/Frameworks folder.
* Examine test cases from ERSeleniumExample/Resources/Selenium/main/ and from [http://wiki.objectstyle.org/confluence/display/WONDER/Getting+Started+with+BugTracker BugTracker] in Eclipse text editor.
* Launch ERSeleniumExample and point your browser to SeleniumStartTesting Direct Action url (e.g. http://192.168.0.58/cgi-bin/WebObjects/ERSeleniumExample.woa/-42422/wa/SeleniumStartTesting).

You can also use Selenium IDE to create and edit tests:
* Launch FireFox and install [http://release.openqa.org/selenium-ide/0.8.7/selenium-ide-0.8.7.xpi Selenium IDE Firefox plugin].
* Using [http://wiki.openqa.org/display/SIDE/Contributed+Extensions+and+Formats Selenium IDE format plugin installation instructions] install Selenese-ide-plugin.js (it is in ERSelenium/Resources).
* Play around with test cases from ERSeleniumExample/Resources/Selenium/ using Selenium IDE.

=Overview and Usage Notes=

ERSelenium provides several features for effective use of [http://openqa.org/selenium-core/ SeleniumCore] with WebObjects applications including:
* Custom setup/teardown actions that can be run before/after each test.
* Base URL independence.
* Support of HTML and Selenese test formats (Java support is planned).
* &quot;On-the-fly&quot; generation of test suites from the files in your project's source tree.
* Bookmarkable DirectAction url to run all tests (can be used for automated testing).
* Metacommands (special instructions specified in comments).
  
''[http://openqa.org/selenium-core/ SeleniumCore] is the powerful javascript toolkit for web applications &quot;black-box&quot; testing. It emulates different kinds of user actions such as: clicking the hyperlink, editing text in the input field, choosing item from the list and so on.''

==Using ERSelenium==

You can use ERSelenium directly from workspace:
# Specify it as your project's workspace dependency .
# Enable it in the project's Properties file:
&lt;pre&gt;
SeleniumTestsEnabled=true
&lt;/pre&gt;
   
Debug output of ERSelenium can be enabled in Properties by:
&lt;pre&gt;
log4j.logger.er.selenium = DEBUG
&lt;/pre&gt;

Other ERSelenium properties:
* '''SeleniumTestsRoot=&quot;SomeOtherPath&quot;''' - change the tests location. By default ERSelenium will search for tests in &quot;Resources/Selenium&quot;.
* '''SeleniumActionsClass=&quot;FullClassName&quot;''' - specifies the class with methods, which should be executed before and during the test using SeleniumAction direct action (see below for details). By default SeleniumDefaultSetupActions class is used.
* '''SeleniumReportPath=&quot;PathName&quot;''' - specified the path to the report file, which is created after the testing is done. &quot;./Contents/Resources/&quot; is the default value.

In your SeleniumTestsRoot folder (Resources/Selenium by default) you should create tests hierarchy. Tests are divided into groups, each group is located in its own folder. In each folder there should be a collection of test files, each in one of the formats, supported by ERSelenium. Example hierarchy:
&lt;pre&gt;
./Resources
  ./Selenium
    ./registration
      ./successful.sel
      ./alreadyexists.sel
    ./shop
      ./buyitem.html
      ./notenoughmoney.html
      ./transfer.sel
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can use both standard HTML and wiki-like Selenese formats for writing tests although Selenese format is usually a preferred choice.

To run all tests point your browser to SeleniumStartTesting Direct Action:
http://[baseurl]/wa/SeleniumStartTesting

Example:
http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/WebObjects/SampleProject.woa/-42421/wa/SeleniumStartTesting

To run a specific group of tests, add &quot;/TestGroupName&quot;:
&lt;pre&gt;
http://[baseurl]/wa/SeleniumStartTesting/TestGroupName
http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/WebObjects/SampleProject.woa/-42421/wa/SeleniumStartTesting/registration
&lt;/pre&gt;

=Some tips for writing tests for ERSelenium=
* Don't use full URLs with open/openWindow commands (http://[baseurl] part will be added by ERSelenium):
&lt;pre&gt;
  |open|/wa/EditPerson|
  |open|/|
&lt;/pre&gt;
* You can use setup/teardown methods from the class, specified in SeleniumActionsClass property by opening /wa/SeleniumAction/methodName URL, e.g.:
&lt;pre&gt;
  |open|/wa/SeleniumAction/resetSession|
&lt;/pre&gt;
* You can use @repeat-@values-@done metacommands to execute specific part of the test with different values edited in textboxes, e.g.:
&lt;pre&gt;
  |open|/|
  @repeat
  ...some actions...
  @values __selenium_test@ @__sel notcorrect@@
  |type|xpath=id('content')/input|__selenium_test@incorrectdomain|
  ...some actions...
  @done
&lt;/pre&gt;
The commands between @repeat and @done will be repeated several times, each time with new value in &quot;xpath=id('content')/input&quot; input field.
  
''Note: in Selenese format, lines that don't begin with &quot;|&quot; are treated as comments, so metacommands in the example above will be safely processed by Selenium IDE.''
* [http://release.openqa.org/selenium-ide/0.8.7/selenium-ide-0.8.7.xpi Selenium IDE Firefox plugin] and [https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/1095  XPath Checker] can be very handy for creating and editing Selenium tests. Selenium IDE Selenese source plugin with proper comments support resides in ERSelenium/Resources/selenese-ide-plugin.js.

== Overview ==

'''''Mrs. Norris''''' is a cat, the pet of [[../Argus Filch/]], the caretaker at [[../../Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. She is described as a thoroughly unpleasant cat, almost skeletally thin; but Filch evidently cares very deeply for her.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

When [[../Harry Potter|Harry]], [[../Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[../Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[../Neville Longbottom|Neville]] are in the Trophy Room waiting for [[../Draco Malfoy/]] to arrive for the promised Wizard's Duel at midnight, Filch's approach is heralded by us overhearing him talking to Mrs. Norris.

As Harry is on his way to the library at Christmas, under his [[../../Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], he passes Mrs. Norris in the halls. Mrs. Norris seems to be able to perceive him, but may not be able to recognize him as a student; in any event, she allows him to pass without going for Filch.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

During [[../Nearly Headless Nick/]]'s Deathday party, Mrs. Norris is Petrified and left hanging by her tail from a torch bracket. Filch is fiercely angry at this, demanding that someone must be punished. He spends much of the book sitting at the spot where Mrs. Norris was actually left hanging.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Mrs. Norris seems to distrust all of the Hogwarts students, and seems to have no mission in life other than to report their infractions to Filch. In return, all of the students detest Mrs. Norris, and many have expressed a wish to do her harm; however, whether through their fear of Filch or their inability to catch her, no harm has yet befallen her from the students.

== Analysis ==

Mrs. Norris seems exceptionally smart for a cat, to the point that we might think her a cat / [[../../Magic/Kneazle|Kneazle]] cross like [[../Crookshanks/]], an [[../../Magic/Animagus|Animagus]], or Filch's familiar, it those existed in this world. However, [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/rumours_view.cfm?id=40 the author has stated] that she is just a highly unpleasant cat.

      <comment>/* Command Line -- Interfacing */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">What about this for example:

 for /R %%A in (*.mpg) do IF NOT EXIST &quot;%dgindex%&quot; &quot;%~1%%~pnA.d2v&quot; -AIF=[%~1%%~pnxA] -OF=[%~1%%~pnA] -exit

as an example for parsing all .d2v files within a directory using DGIndex (a program part of video-editing).

I didn't write the command myself, but I just tweaked the one I was given to suit the task at hand.
Can anyone explain the use of the 'A' variable instead of 'I' in %~1%%~pnxA, and maybe explain fully what exactly is implied here?

== Command Line -- Interfacing ==

I created CountArgs.exe and counts.bat precisely according to your examples, and the value returned in DOS prompt wasn't 3, but 4.
Is there any mistake?

''I believe so, I have attempted to correct it''--[[User:AAdaamS|AAdaamS]] ([[User talk:AAdaamS|talk]]) 11:48, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

== Format of wiki page ==
Sorry for being negative, but the formating of the wiki text is quite bad. If just feels someone has copied the text from somewhere.

== Method of getting user input ==
User input in DOS is very hard to get, but there are two things that you can do: &lt;tt&gt;SET /p&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;CHOICE.COM&lt;/tt&gt;. The former is a DOS command that puts user input into a variable. The latter is a dos program you can download. I might document these some time in this book if I can.

== History ==
When the first modern digital computers appeared in the early 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Leondes|title= intelligent systems: technology and applications|year=2002| publisher=CRC Press| isbn =9780849311215 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the instructions to make them operate were wired into the machine.  At this time, people working with computers were engineers, mostly electrical engineers.  This hardware centric design was not flexible and was quickly replaced with the &quot;stored program architecture&quot; or von Neumann architecture.  Thus the first division between &quot;hardware&quot; and &quot;software&quot; began with abstraction being used to deal with the complexity of computing.

Programming languages started to appear in the 1950s and this was also another major step in abstraction.  Major languages such as Fortran, ALGOL, and COBOL were released in the late 1950s to deal with scientific, algorithmic, and business problems respectively.  E.W. Dijkstra wrote his seminal paper, &quot;Go To Statement Considered Harmful&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; in 1968 and David Parnas introduced the key concept of modularity and information hiding in 1972&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help programmers deal with the ever increasing complexity of software systems.  A software system for managing the hardware called an operating system was also introduced, most notably by Unix in 1969. In 1967, the Simula language introduced the object-oriented programming paradigm.

These advances in software were met with more advances in computer hardware.  In the mid 1970s, the microcomputer was introduced, making it economical for hobbyists to obtain a computer and write software for it.  This in turn led to the now famous Personal Computer (PC) and Microsoft Windows.  The Software Development Life Cycle or SDLC was also starting to appear as a consensus for centralized construction of software in the mid 1980s. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw the introduction of several new Simula-inspired object-oriented programming languages, including Smalltalk, Objective-C, and C++.

Open-source software started to appear in the early 90s in the form of Linux and other software introducing the &quot;bazaar&quot; or decentralized style of constructing software.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Eric S. ''The Cathedral and the Bazaar''. ed 3.0. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  Then the World Wide Web and the popularization of the Internet hit in the mid 90s, changing the engineering of software once again.  Distributed systems gained sway as a way to design systems, and the Java programming language was introduced with its virtual machine as another step in abstraction.  Programmers collaborated and wrote the Agile Manifesto, which favored more lightweight processes to create cheaper and more timely software.

The current definition of ''software engineering'' is still being debated by practitioners today as they struggle to come up with ways to produce software that is &quot;cheaper, better, faster&quot;. Cost reduction has been a primary focus of the IT industry since the 1990s.  Total cost of ownership represents the costs of more than just acquisition. It includes things like productivity impediments, upkeep efforts, and resources needed to support infrastructure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Installation==

If you have just obtained a copy of Mathematica, you will need to install it on your system. To do this, you should follow the instructions that come with your copy.

==Interfacing with Mathematica==

Mathematica runs as a &quot;kernel&quot; which performs the calculations and the &quot;front-end&quot; with which it communicates with the user by input and output. Mathematica can be used either through interactive &quot;notebook&quot; files or through a command prompt-style text interface. 

===Notebook Interface===
The notebook style interface can be started by clicking a Mathematica icon or a Mathematica entry on the start menu. When this is done, a blank notebook is opened.

You can then input commands into the notebook inteface. Pressing &lt;tt&gt;Shift-Enter&lt;/tt&gt; executes the command and produces the output you desire.

When a command is executed, it is labeled automatically by &lt;tt&gt;In[n]:=&lt;/tt&gt;, where &quot;&lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; is a unique identifier (for that session) for your input. The corresponding output is labeled &lt;tt&gt;Out[n]:=&lt;/tt&gt;. For example, consider the following command where you add 2 and 3. You simply type &quot;&lt;tt&gt;2+3&lt;/tt&gt; and press &lt;tt&gt;Shift-Enter&lt;/tt&gt;. The notebook will then display the following:

 In[1]:=  '''2+3'''

 Out[1]=  5

====Quitting====
To quit the notebook, you may click the &quot;X&quot; in the top-right of the notebook window, or press &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-F4&lt;/tt&gt; or select the &lt;tt&gt;Close&lt;/tt&gt; menu item in the File menu. This will prompt you to save if the notebook has been edited since the last save. To close the whole of Mathematica, click the &quot;X&quot; in the top right of the Mathematica window, or select the &lt;tt&gt;Exit&lt;/tt&gt; option on the File menu.

===Text Interface===

The text interface can be started in a terminal (command “math”). Input is entered as usual but it's only necessary to press “enter” to execute commands (some characters though cannot be entered — greek letters, integrals, etc. — but equivalent commands will exist).  Because of the terminal's limitations, the output is formatted differently from the graphical interface: when possible formulae are rendered with 2D constructs mimicking fractions, exponents, etc., while plots are not shown (a string “-Graphics-” appears instead).

To quit the text interface, one can use the “&lt;code&gt;Quit[]&lt;/code&gt;” command or type an “end of file” character (Unix: &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-D&lt;/code&gt;).

The text interface is most suitable to the batch execution of code or remote development when desktop sharing isn't an option (either because the bandwidth doesn't allow it or when there are restrictions preventing one from resorting to the notebook interface). This can be done by writing the code in a file and tell Mathematica to run it. This would typically be run as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
math &lt; code.m
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

==Observables and operators==
Remember the mean values
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle x\rangle=\int |\psi|^2\,x\,dx \quad\hbox{and}\quad 
\langle p\rangle=\hbar\langle k\rangle=\int |\overline{\psi}|^2\,\hbar k\,dk.
&lt;/math&gt;
As noted already, if we define the operators
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat x=x&lt;/math&gt; (&quot;multiply with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&quot;) and &lt;math&gt;\hat p=-i\hbar\frac\partial{\partial x},&lt;/math&gt;
then we can write
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle x\rangle=\int \psi^*\,\hat x\,\psi\,dx\quad\hbox{and}\quad 
\langle p\rangle=\int \psi^*\,\hat p\,\psi\,dx.
&lt;/math&gt;
By the same token,
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle E\rangle=\int \psi^*\,\hat E\,\psi\,dx \quad\hbox{with}\quad \hat E=i\hbar\frac\partial{\partial t}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Which observable is associated with the differential operator &lt;math&gt;\partial/\partial\phi&lt;/math&gt;? If &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; are constant (as the partial derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; requires), then &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is constant, and
:&lt;math&gt;
{\partial\psi\over\partial\phi}={\partial y\over\partial\phi}\,{\partial\psi\over\partial y}+{\partial x\over\partial\phi}\,{\partial\psi\over\partial x}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Given that &lt;math&gt;x=r\sin\theta\,\cos\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=r\sin\theta\,\sin\phi,&lt;/math&gt; this works out at &lt;math&gt;x{\partial\psi\over\partial y}-y{\partial\psi\over\partial x}&lt;/math&gt; or 
:&lt;math&gt;
-i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial\phi}=\hat x\hat p_y - \hat y\hat p_x.
&lt;/math&gt;
Since, classically, orbital angular momentum is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p},&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;L_z=x\,p_y-y\,p_x,&lt;/math&gt; it seems obvious that we should consider &lt;math&gt;\hat x\hat p_y - \hat y\hat p_x&lt;/math&gt; as the operator &lt;math&gt;\hat l_z&lt;/math&gt; associated with the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;component of the atom's angular momentum.

Yet we need to be wary of basing quantum-mechanical definitions on classical ones. Here are the quantum-mechanical definitions:

Consider the wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi(q_k,t)&lt;/math&gt; of a closed system &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;degrees of freedom. Suppose that the probability distribution &lt;math&gt;|\psi(q_k,t)|^2&lt;/math&gt; (which is short for &lt;math&gt;|\psi(q_1,\dots,q_K,t)|^2&lt;/math&gt;) is invariant under translations in time: waiting for any amount of time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; makes no difference to it:
:&lt;math&gt;
|\psi(q_k,t)|^2=|\psi(q_k,t+\tau)|^2.
&lt;/math&gt;
Then the time dependence of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is confined to a phase factor &lt;math&gt;e^{i\alpha(q_k,t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Further suppose that the time coordinate&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and the space coordinates&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q_k&lt;/math&gt; are homogeneous — equal intervals are physically equivalent. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is closed, the phase factor &lt;math&gt;e^{i\alpha(q_k,t)}&lt;/math&gt; cannot then depend on&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q_k,&lt;/math&gt; and its phase can at most linearly depend on&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t:&lt;/math&gt; waiting for &lt;math&gt;2\tau&lt;/math&gt; should have the same effect as twice waiting for&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\tau.&lt;/math&gt; In other words, multiplying the wave function by &lt;math&gt;e^{i\alpha(2\tau)}&lt;/math&gt; should have same effect as multiplying it twice by &lt;math&gt;e^{i\alpha(\tau)}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
e^{i\alpha(2\tau)}=[e^{i\alpha(\tau)}]^2=e^{i2\alpha(\tau)}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(q_k,t)=\psi(q_k)\,e^{-i\omega t}=\psi(q_k)\,e^{-(i/\hbar)E\,t}.
&lt;/math&gt;
So the existence of a constant (&quot;conserved&quot;) quantity &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; or (in conventional units)&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is implied for a closed system, and this is what we mean by the ''energy'' of the system.

Now suppose that &lt;math&gt;|\psi(q_k,t)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under translations in the direction of one of the spatial coordinates&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q_k,&lt;/math&gt; say&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q_j&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
|\psi(q_j,q_{k\neq j},t)|^2=|\psi(q_j+\kappa,q_{k\neq j},t)|^2.
&lt;/math&gt;
Then the dependence of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;q_j&lt;/math&gt; is confined to a phase factor &lt;math&gt;e^{i\beta(q_k,t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

And suppose again that the time coordinates&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q_k&lt;/math&gt; are homogeneous. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is closed, the phase factor &lt;math&gt;e^{i\beta(q_k,t)}&lt;/math&gt; cannot then depend on&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q_{k\neq j}&lt;/math&gt; or&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t,&lt;/math&gt; and its phase can at most linearly depend on&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q_j&lt;/math&gt;: translating &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;2\kappa&lt;/math&gt; should have the same effect as twice translating it by&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\kappa.&lt;/math&gt; In other words, multiplying the wave function by &lt;math&gt;e^{i\beta(2\kappa)}&lt;/math&gt; should have same effect as multiplying it twice by &lt;math&gt;e^{i\beta(\kappa)}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
e^{i\beta(2\kappa)}=[e^{i\beta(\kappa)}]^2=e^{i2\beta(\kappa)}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(q_k,t)=\psi(q_{k\neq j},t)\,e^{i\,k_j\,q_k}=\psi(q_{k\neq j},t)\,e^{(i/\hbar)\,p_j\,q_k}.
&lt;/math&gt;
So the existence of a constant (&quot;conserved&quot;) quantity &lt;math&gt;k_j&lt;/math&gt; or (in conventional units)&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt; is implied for a closed system, and this is what we mean by the j-component of the system's ''momentum''.

You get the picture. Moreover, the spatial coordiates might as well be the spherical coordinates &lt;math&gt;r,\theta,\phi.&lt;/math&gt; If &lt;math&gt;|\psi(r,\theta,\phi,t)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under rotations about the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis, and if the longitudinal coordinate &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is homogeneous, then
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(r,\theta,\phi,t)=\psi(r,\theta,t)\,e^{i m\phi}=\psi(r,\theta,t)\,e^{(i/\hbar) l_z\phi}.
&lt;/math&gt;
In this case we call the conserved quantity the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;component of the system's ''angular momentum''.

&lt;br&gt;
----

&lt;br&gt;Now suppose that &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; is an observable, that &lt;math&gt;\hat O&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding operator, and that &lt;math&gt;\psi_{\hat O,v}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat O\,\psi_{\hat O,v}=v\,\psi_{\hat O,v}.
&lt;/math&gt;
We say that &lt;math&gt;\psi_{\hat O,v}&lt;/math&gt; is an ''eigenfunction'' or ''eigenstate'' of the operator&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\hat O,&lt;/math&gt; and that it has the ''eigenvalue''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;v.&lt;/math&gt; Let's calculate the mean and the standard deviation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\psi_{\hat O,v}.&lt;/math&gt; We obviously have that
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle O\rangle=\int\psi^*_{\hat O,v}\hat O\,\psi_{\hat O,v}\,dx=\int\psi^*_{\hat O,v}v\,\psi_{\hat O,v}\,dx=v\int|\psi_{\hat O,v}|^2\,dx=v.
&lt;/math&gt;
Hence
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta O=\sqrt{\int \psi^*_{\hat O,v}\,(\hat O-v)\,(\hat O-v)\,\psi_{\hat O,v}\,dx }=0,
&lt;/math&gt;
since &lt;math&gt;(\hat O-v)\,\psi_{\hat O,v}=0.&lt;/math&gt; For a system associated with &lt;math&gt;\psi_{\hat O,v},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;is dispersion-free. Hence the probability of finding that the value of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; lies in an interval containing&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;v,&lt;/math&gt; is&amp;nbsp;1. But we have that
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat E\,\psi(q_k)\,e^{-(i/\hbar)E\,t}=E\,\psi(q_k)\,e^{-(i/\hbar)E\,t}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat p_j\,\psi(q_{k\neq j},t)\,e^{(i/\hbar)\,p_j\,q_k}=p_j\,\psi(q_{k\neq j},t)\,e^{(i/\hbar)\,p_j\,q_k}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat l_z\,\psi(r,\theta,t)\,e^{(i/\hbar)\,l_z\phi}=l_z\,\psi(r,\theta,t) \,e^{(i/\hbar)\,l_z\phi}.
&lt;/math&gt;
So, indeed, &lt;math&gt;\hat l_z&lt;/math&gt; is the operator associated with the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;component of the atom's angular momentum.

Observe that the eigenfunctions of any of these operators are associated with systems for which the corresponding observable is &quot;sharp&quot;: the standard deviation measuring its fuzziness vanishes.

For obvious reasons we also have
:&lt;math&gt;
{\hat l}_x=-i\hbar\left(y{\partial\over\partial z}-z{\partial\over\partial y}\right)\quad
\hbox{and}\quad{\hat l}_y=-i\hbar\left(z{\partial\over\partial x}-x{\partial\over\partial z}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;
If we define the ''commutator'' &lt;math&gt;[{\hat A},{\hat B}]\equiv{\hat A}{\hat B}-{\hat B}{\hat A},&lt;/math&gt; then saying that the operators &lt;math&gt;{\hat A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\hat B}&lt;/math&gt; commute is the same as saying that their commutator vanishes. Later we will prove that two observables are ''compatible'' (can be simultaneously measured) if and only if their operators ''commute''.

&lt;br&gt;'''Exercise''': Show that &lt;math&gt;[{\hat l}_x,{\hat l}_y]\,=i\hbar{\hat l}_z.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;One similarly finds that &lt;math&gt;[{\hat l}_y,{\hat l}_z]=i\hbar{\hat l}_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[{\hat l}_z,{\hat l}_x]=i\hbar{\hat l}_y.&lt;/math&gt; The upshot: different components of a system's angular momentum are ''incompatible''.

&lt;br&gt;'''Exercise''': Using the above commutators, show that the operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{L}^2}\equiv{\hat l}_x^2+{\hat l}_y^2+{\hat l}_z^2&lt;/math&gt; commutes with &lt;math&gt;{\hat l}_x,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;{\hat l}_y,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\hat l}_z.&lt;/math&gt;
