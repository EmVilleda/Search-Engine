In this tutorial, we will be making a Title Screen and a Main Menu Screen to come from that Title Screen. While most people hardly pay attention to these areas on a real video game, they do make the game seem much better to play, and gives the player a certain choice of what they can do before they play the game. Before beginning this, make sure you familiarize yourself with several logic sensors and actuators, such as &quot;Scene&quot; and &quot;Property&quot;, as they will heavily be relied upon. It is also best if you have several Pictures ready to use for your game or are ready for additional functions with certain programs (a Word Processor Program and Image Editing Program [that has a transparency setting] can help move along your game.)

== Making An Easy Title Menu ==
The Title Screen will be very simple -- it will be the &quot;Press Enter to Continue&quot; kind. This will lead to a more interactive kind of Main Menu, in which you can use either key commands or the mouse pointer. This tutorial will not be the most visually pleasing, but then again, you can always add whatever graphics you would like. Again, it would be wise to have handy a word-processing program and a program like Microsoft Paint. &quot;Print Screen&quot; will be a useful function to use while following this tutorial -- the corresponding button is generally located to the right of the F12 key in the row of function keys on your keyboard.

'''''If you have never used different scenes before, you're about to get a crash course. Also, Blender hotkeys and actions will not be explained with (A-key) or (numpad-6); it is assumed you have already learned at least how to perform basic Blender functions.'''''

=== Making the Menu ===
First, start up Blender and delete everything in the scene. Then, move to top orthographic view (press numpad 7, or if you have not a numpad, go to the hidden top menu and in the System &amp; OpenGL section select &quot;emulate numpad&quot;). 

[[Image:Clear_Blender.jpg|250px]]

The first thing you should do is add a new scene. In the Information view panel at the top, click the SCE: drop-down menu and click on ADD NEW. Label this new scene something like &quot;Main Menu&quot;. Now go back to your original scene and name it something like &quot;Title Menu&quot;. These names will be important when it comes to changing the scenes around. So, on your &quot;Title Menu&quot; Scene, begin by adding a Camera. Move this Camera in the Z direction about a point, just to get it above the grid. Now, set the camera view to Orthographic. Now switch to Camera View. Add a plane that is scaled to cover the entire surface of the Camera's view-bounds. Move that plane just a little bit in the -Z direction. Then, add another plane, but scale this plane to be a thin rectangle about 2/3rds down the Y-length of the Camera, centered in X-direction.

[[Image:main_menu_starting.JPG|250px]]

&lt;small&gt;'''(Image Shown with Materials for visual purposes, DON'T ADD MATERIALS)'''&lt;/small&gt;

''Now this next step isn't necessary, but if you want a good-looking game you will probably need this step.''

Let's add some UV textures. Open a good photo/image-editing program like Photoshop, GIMP, or Microsoft Photo Editor; something that preferably supports Transparency. Type some text appropriate for your game such as, &quot;Press any key to continue.&quot; What I do is add lots of extra space and add additional text that I will use in the main menu too, such as &quot;New Game&quot;, &quot;Continue&quot;, &quot;Story Mode&quot;, etc. so it is all in one image for multiple UV textures. If your editor supports it, set the background color to transparent. If not, set it to black so it will register as 0 on the alpha channel in Blender. Save the image (GIF or PNG are reasonable choices for use with transparency). Now, in Blender, split the 3D screen into 2 screens, and change one screen over to UV face select. Select your small rectangle, and switch to Edit Mode and Unwrap the face in the 3D window, then open your saved image in the UV face window. Scale your face in the UV window so it holds only the &quot;Press Any Key to Continue&quot; graphic. If you wish, also add a starting Image on the larger rectangle.

=== Setting Up The Actions ===
Now this step is necessary. Select the large background rectangle, in the Buttons Window at the bottom switch it to the Logic Tab. This will be very simple. Add one Sensor, one Actuator, and one Controller. Make the sensor a Keyboard Sensor, depress the &quot;True Pulse&quot; button, and in the key area depress the &quot;All Keys&quot; button. Make the Controller an &quot;AND&quot; controller. Make the Actuator a  Scene Actuator. Select the Drop-Down box and  make it &quot;Set Scene&quot; wit &quot;SCE:Main Menu&quot;. '''Before you test the game, make sure to save and add a Camera to the &quot;Main Menu&quot; Scene. Otherwise the game WILL crash.'''&lt;br&gt;

If you want the option of returning to this scene, instead of one Actuator make two. Make both of them Scene, but make one &quot;Suspend Scene&quot; with &quot;SCE:Title Menu&quot; and make the other Actuator &quot;Add Overlay Scene&quot; with &quot;SCE:Main Menu&quot;. Also, that means in the Main Menu Scene later you'll have to add some key to hit or some action to &quot;Remove Scene&quot; &quot;SCE:Main Menu&quot; and &quot;Resume Scene&quot; &quot;SCE:Title Menu&quot;.

== Author's Starting Menu Example ==
''The following contains actual in-progress work by the original Author of this page. The work and ideas are heavily copyrighted and it is highly encouraged (begged) that you do not rip this content off--the author has submitted this work generously to help less advanced users more efficiently.''

The following is my work on a game I am making, and I hope it helps you too.

[[Image:In_Arms_Starting_Menu.JPG]]

This will get you to the next menu, which will be on the next section.

== A Main Menu ==
This menu will be more difficult,using a mouse-python function to use and make the mouse appear when you play your game and a maze of sensors and actuators entangled. &lt;br&gt;

Here is the first thing you need: a python script to make the Mouse show --- 

''*This code is attributed to the author of the chapter &quot;Blender Game Engine/A Simple Mouse Pointer&quot; and this is not my own code.''

&lt;code&gt;import Rasterizer as r

r.showMouse(1)&lt;/code&gt;

Put this in the text editor, and save the text as something simple like &quot;Mouse&quot;. Now, on your Main Menu scene, select the camera and add 1 sensor, 2 controllers, 1 actuator, and 1 property. Name the property &quot;Switch&quot; &quot;Int&quot; Type, and set it to 0. Set up your logic as follows:

[[Image:showpointer.jpg]]

A change will need to be made in order to make yours work. The python controller should be Script:Mouse, not Script:showpointer. If you can't see the connections:&lt;br&gt;
*Connect the Sensor to the 2 controllers&lt;br&gt;
*Connect the AND controller to the actuator&lt;br&gt;
*Leave the Python controller open-ended&lt;br&gt;
If you play the game, you will see the mouse then! Now, back to the Menu, there are multiple kinds of Menus you can make when it comes to Menus popping up. The one I believe works best is a 3-layered button. To explain what this means, I'll run you through the steps of making one. Let's start with the layers themselves. (For this to work best, make the background of any images you use have transparency, so you can make invisible-yet-clickable faces.) Create a rectangle facing the camera where you want your first menu option to be. Copy the object until you have 3 rectangles, and make each one very slightly in front of the last. Now, Select the back rectangle, and on this one apply the UV face of the option's words. The second rectangle is the UV face for a graphic outline around the words if the option is selected in the game. It's not necessary but then again, it helps the player with selecting options and it looks nice. The top rectangle will be the selectable one--make the UV face applied only over a completely transparent area. Now, for the logic. 

Text-Rectangle:&lt;br&gt;
-No Logic Needed&lt;br&gt;

Outline-Rectangle:&lt;br&gt;
-Give it a Property named &quot;Selected&quot;, Int Type, starting at 0.&lt;br&gt;
-Make a Property Sensor, True Pulse, &quot;Selected&quot; Property is Equal to 1, Connected to an AND controller, Connected to a Visibility Actuator at &quot;Visible&quot;&lt;br&gt;
-Make a Property Sensor, True Pulse, &quot;Selected&quot; Property is Equal to 0, Connected to an AND controller, Connected to a Visibility Actuator at &quot;Invisible&quot;&lt;br&gt;
-Make a Property Actuator, &quot;Selected&quot; Property is Assigned Amount 1
-Make a Property Actuator, &quot;Selected&quot; Property is Assigned Amount 0
-Create AND Controller and connect both Mouse Sensors. Make this AND Controller connect to the Outline-Rectangle's Property Actuator &quot;Selected&quot; Assign=1. &lt;br&gt;

Transparent-Rectangle:&lt;br&gt;
-2 Mouse sensors: &quot;Mouse Over&quot; and &quot;Left Button&quot;. Set them to &quot;True Pulse&quot;.&lt;br&gt;


'''''(Click Image to Enlarge)'''''&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Blender_Button_arraignment.jpg|300px]]&lt;br&gt;

Now here is the trickier part to explain. To make things a little more simple, name that last Outline-Rectangle's AND controller connected to the 2 mouse sensors. Select all 3 layers, and duplicate them 3 times. Make each one (in camera view) below the last, making sure to keep them parallel on the Z axis. Now, to make only one selected at a time, take the named controller of the first, and connect it to the Outline-Rectangle's Property Actuator &quot;Selected&quot; Assign=0 of second and third button. Do the same from the second button to the first and third one, and same with the third to the first and second. It should look like the picture:&lt;br&gt;

'''''Click Image to Enlarge'''''&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Blender_Multi_Button.jpg|300px]]&lt;br&gt;

This logic arraignment should yield (when the game is played) options in which if you click one it will light up, and if you click another, that one will go down and the other will light up.&lt;br&gt;

Now this looks nice aesthetically, but the use of it is now all you have to do is make some Scene Actuators. Add 2 more actuators to each of the Transparent Planes. Use the same method as you did with the Properties, but instead of &quot;Property Assign 1/0&quot; make 1 AND controller, 1 Scene Overlay and 1 Scene Remove for each transparent button. Now make 3 additional Scenes, and either make an entirely new menu for each, or to be easier just make colored rectangles on the scene, different colors for each scene -- either way, make sure that, if the scenes overlay, the additional scene won't cover up the buttons of the Main Menu Scene. So, now connect the 2 Mouse Sensors to the corresponding AND Controller, and connect that to the Corresponding &quot;Overlay Scene&quot; Actuator and 2 Opposing &quot;Remove Scene&quot; Actuators. Do this with the other 2 Transparent Rectangles. Make sure your new scenes also have cameras and that they are scaled properly.&lt;br&gt;

'''''Click Image to Enlarge'''''&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Blender Linking Menus.jpg|300px]]&lt;br&gt;

You can use this technique to make Menus and Sub-Menus Galore! It's fairly simple to make multiple sublevels of this and get back to the original scene with this method. 

I hope this helped you make your menus work well.

==Functions==
A Javascript function is a code-block that can be reused. It can be called via an event, or by manual calling.
===Basic Example===
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
function myFunction(string) {
	alert(string);
	document.innerHTML += string;
}
myFunction(&quot;hello&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;
The example would first:
*Define the myFunction function
*Call the myFunction function with arguement &quot;hello&quot;
The result:
*An alert message with 'hello'
*The string 'hello' being added to the end of the document's/page's HTML.

==Objects==
The great thing about Javascript is that it is an OOP (Object Oriented Programming) language.
This means that with an OOP language, you can make your own objects (like the ''document'' object) and even define your own variable types.
===Basic Example===
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var site = new Object(); //Required to not cause error in Internet Explorer
site = {};
site.test = function(string) {
	alert(&quot;Hello World! &quot;+string);
	site.string = string;
}
site.test(&quot;Boo!&quot;);
alert(site.string);
&lt;/source&gt;
The example would first:
*Define site as an object
*Define site as a blank object
*Define site.test function
*Call the site.test function with variable &quot;Boo!&quot;
The result:
*An alert message with 'Hello World! Boo!'
*site.string being defined as string
*An alert message with 'Boo!'.

==Basic Usage==
Using the '''Document Object Module''' we can create basic HTML elements. Let's create a div.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var myDiv = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;
What if we want the div to have an ID, or a class?
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var myDiv = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;);
myDiv.id = &quot;myDiv&quot;;
myDiv.class = &quot;main&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;
And we want it added into the page? Let's use the DOM again...
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var myDiv = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;);
myDiv.id = &quot;myDiv&quot;;
myDiv.class = &quot;main&quot;;
document.documentElement.appendChild(myDiv);
&lt;/source&gt;

==Further Use==
So let's have a simple HTML page...
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;white&quot; text=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt; A simple Javascript created button &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;button&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
Where the div which has the id of button, let's add a button.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
myButton = document.createElement(&quot;input&quot;);
myButton.type = &quot;button&quot;;
myButton.value = &quot;my button&quot;;
placeHolder = document.getElementById(&quot;button&quot;);
placeHolder.appendChild(myButton);
&lt;/source&gt;
All together the HTML code looks like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;white&quot; text=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt; A simple Javascript created button &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;button&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
myButton = document.createElement(&quot;input&quot;);
myButton.type = &quot;button&quot;;
myButton.value = &quot;my button&quot;;
placeHolder = document.getElementById(&quot;button&quot;);
placeHolder.appendChild(myButton);
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
The page will now have a button on it which has been created via Javascript.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think the last sentences of both paragraphs (&quot;And we also find that he and his brother are attending Hogwarts in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, when Hogwarts has been closed to all except those who can claim Blood status (prove that there are wizards or witches in their ancestry).&quot;) and (&quot;However: Colin and Dennis remaining at Hogwarts in book 7 is a clear indication that they are not Muggle-born, despite their apparent wonder at the Wizarding world.&quot;) should be removed as there is no hint that Colin and Dennis Creevey were at Hogwarts as students. 

Colin was showing up among many others coming from outside when the last battle was about to start. Furthermore the author herself has stated &quot;Colin wasn’t a student. He sneaked back with the rest of the DA, along with Fred, George and the rest.&quot; [http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript]

:My recollection is that at least one of the Creeveys is mentioned by name as McGonagall sends the underage students off to the Room of Requirement before the first battle. To be confirmed...

{{stub}}

In Javascript, an element can only be deleted from its parent. To delete one, you have to get the element, then find its parent, and delete it using the &lt;code&gt;removeChild&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;ref name=&quot;stackoverflow&quot;&gt;[//stackoverflow.com/questions/3387427/javascript-remove-element-by-id StackOverflow: Javascript: remove element by id]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in a HTML document that looks like
&lt;source lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;parent&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p id=&quot;child&quot;&gt;I'm a child!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
The code you would need to delete the element with the ID &quot;&lt;code&gt;child&lt;/code&gt;&quot; would be
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
// get elements
var child = document.getElementById(&quot;child&quot;);
var parent = document.getElementById(&quot;parent&quot;);

// delete child
parent.removeChild(child);
&lt;/source&gt;
Instead of getting the parent element manually, you can use the &lt;code&gt;parentNode&lt;/code&gt; property of the child to find its parent automatically. The code for this on the above HTML document would look like
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
// get the child element node
var child = document.getElementById(&quot;child&quot;);

// remove the child element from the document
child.parentNode.removeChild(child);
&lt;/source&gt;

A '''string''' is a type of variable which stores a string (chain of characters).

==Basic Use==
To make a new string, you can make a variable and give it a value of &lt;code&gt;new String()&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var foo = new String();
&lt;/source&gt;
But, most developers skip that part and use a string literal:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var foo = &quot;my string&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;
After you have made your string, you can edit it as you like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
foo = &quot;bar&quot;; //foo = &quot;bar&quot;
foo = &quot;barblah&quot;; //foo = &quot;barblah&quot;
foo += &quot;bar&quot;; //foo = &quot;barblahbar&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

A string literal is normally delimited by the &lt;i&gt;'&lt;/i&gt;&amp;thinsp; or &lt;i&gt;&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;thinsp; character, and can normally contain almost any character. Common convention differs on whether to use single quotes or double quotes for strings. Some developers are for single quotes (Crockford, Amaram, Sakalos, Michaux) while others are for double quotes (NextApp, Murray, Dojo). Whichever method you choose, try to be consistent in how you apply it.

Due to the delimiters, it's not possible to directly place either the single or double quote within the string when it's used to start or end the string. In order to work around that limitation, you can either switch to the other type of delimiter for that case, or place a backslash before the quote to ensure that it appears within the string:

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
foo = 'The cat says, &quot;Meow!&quot;';
foo = &quot;The cat says, \&quot;Meow!\&quot;&quot;;
foo = &quot;It's \&quot;cold\&quot; today.&quot;;
foo = 'It\'s &quot;cold&quot; today.';
&lt;/source&gt;

==Properties and methods of the String() object==
As with all objects, Strings have some methods and properties.

===replace(text, newtext)===
The replace() function returns a string with content replaced. Only the first occurrence is replaced.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var foo = &quot;foo bar foo bar foo&quot;;
var newString = foo.replace(&quot;bar&quot;, &quot;NEW!&quot;)
alert(foo); //foo bar foo bar foo
alert(newString); //foo NEW! foo bar foo
&lt;/source&gt;
As you can see, the replace() function only returns the new content and does not modify the 'foo' object.

===concat(text)===
The concat() function joins two strings.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var foo = &quot;Hello&quot;;
var bar = foo.concat(&quot; World!&quot;)
alert(bar); //Hello World!
&lt;/source&gt;

===toUpperCase()===
This function returns the current string in upper case.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var foo = &quot;Hello!&quot;;
alert(foo.toUpperCase()); // HELLO!
&lt;/source&gt;

===toLowerCase()===
This function returns the current string in lower case.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var foo = &quot;Hello!&quot;;
alert(foo.toLowerCase()); // hello!
&lt;/source&gt;

===length===
Returns the length as an integer.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var foo = &quot;Hello!&quot;;
alert(foo.length); // 6
&lt;/source&gt;

===substring(start[, end])===
Substring extracts characters from the ''start'' position
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
&quot;hello&quot;.substring(1); // &quot;ello&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

When the ''end'' is provided, they are extracted up to but not including the end position.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
&quot;hello&quot;.substring(1, 3); // &quot;el&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Substring always works from left to right. If the ''start'' position is larger than the ''end'' position, Substring will swap the values; although sometimes useful, this is not always what you want; different behavior is provided by [[{{FULLPAGENAME}}#{{anchorencode:slice(start[, end])}}|slice]].
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
&quot;hello&quot;.substring(3, 1); // &quot;el&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

===slice(start[, end])===
Slice extracts characters from the ''start'' position, essentially the same as substring
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
&quot;hello&quot;.slice(1); // &quot;ello&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

When the ''end'' is provided, they are extracted up to but not including the end position.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
&quot;hello&quot;.slice(1, 3); // &quot;el&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Slice allows you to extract text referenced from the end of the string by using negative indexing.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
&quot;hello&quot;.slice(-4, -2); // &quot;el&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Unlike Substring, the Slice method never swaps the ''start'' and ''end'' positions.  If the ''start'' is after the ''end'', Slice will attempt to extract the content as presented, but will most likely provide unexpected results.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
&quot;hello&quot;.slice(3, 1); // &quot;&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

===substr(start[, number of characters])===
substr extracts characters from the ''start'' position, essentially the same as substring/slice
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
&quot;hello&quot;.substr(1); // &quot;ello&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

When the ''number of characters'' is provided, they are extracted by count.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
&quot;hello&quot;.substr(1, 3); // &quot;ell&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

    <title>Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Motion Tracking with Icarus</title>

'''Motion tracking''', also called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_moving '''Match moving'''], is an essential element when integrating 3D elements with live footage. Motion tracking software is usually pretty expensive, but the Icarus application (Windows and Mac) is available for free for educational use. Icarus, which hasn't been updated for  while, was later replaced by the commercial application [http://www.thepixelfarm.co.uk/product.php?productId=PFTrack PFTrack]. Other popular motion tracking applications are [http://www.thepixelfarm.co.uk/product.php?productId=PFMatchit PFMatchit] and [http://www.pfhoe.com/ PFHoe](both also from The Pixel Farm), [http://www.digilab.uni-hannover.de/docs/manual.html Voodoo] (for Windows/Linux; free for non-commercial use), [http://www.ssontech.com/ SynthEyes], [http://www.2d3.com/product/?v=1 Boujou] and [http://www.sci-d-vis.com 3D-Equalizer] (commercial).

The excellent CG prodigy [http://www.peerlessproductions.com Colin Levy] hosts Icarus(by kind permission of The Pixel Farm Ltd), the Icarus import script for Blender, as well as a splendid video tutorial (see [http://www.peerlessproductions.com/tuts/pages/Icarus.html Download Icarus and Video Tutorial]). However, I lacked a brief text tutorial about motion tracking, so I decided to write my own. This tutorial is extremely brief and high-level, and requires some previous knowledge on video editing, 3D, and Blender.

'''Note:''' this tutorial was created using Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, Blender 2.46, Icarus 2.09, and the [http://www.peerlessproductions.com/tuts/IcarusTutorials/ICARUS_import241.zip Icarus Import Script for Blender] v1.07e (for Blender 2.41, written by Alfredo de Greef).

=== Tutorial ===
==== Phase 1: Preparing the Video Footage ====
'''Note:''' this tutorial explains the ''Auto-feature Tracking'' mode in Icarus. There are other options which gives more user control - see the Icarus '''UserGuide.pdf''' for more information.

# Record your video footage. Having the camera on a tripod (thus limiting to just panning/rotating) simplifies the tracking, but Icarus can handle a hand-held camera as well. Filming a background with orthogonal lines (that can align to X/Y/Z dimensions), such as a room, also helps the tracking.
# Capture/import your video footage to your computer. Icarus handles video up to DV resolution (720*576 pixels).
# Start the Icarus ''Calibration'' application (there is also a ''Distortion'' and a ''Reconstruction'' application).
# Create a new project (Project-&gt;New).
# Import your video footage (Project-&gt;Import Movie).
# Fill in the ''Camera Parameters'' information in the window that pops up - especially the ''Camera Motion'' and the ''Pixel Aspect'' options.
# In the left panel, expand the group called ''Coordinate Frame''. You should see X Axis, Y Axis, etc.
# Click the Z Axis tool (blue) and mark vertical lines in your video footage. Use the X Axis (red) and Y Axis (green) tools to mark horizontal lines (up to you to decide which should be X and Y).
# Estimate the focal length (Camera-&gt;Estimate Focal Length).
# Navigate in time in your video footage using the time slider (beneath the video image). Add more X/Y/Z marker lines on a few key frames, especially as new pieces of the background are revealed when the camera moves.
# Save your project (Project-&gt;Save).
# Start the tracking process (Camera-&gt;Track and Calibrate). This will take some time.
# Export the results in human-readable form (Project-&gt;Export 3D Motion, select ''Human Readable (*.txt)'' as file type).

==== Phase 2: Importing the Motion Tracking Data into Blender ====
# Start Blender, and open a Text Editor view.
# Open the Icarus import script '''ICARUS_import241.py''' (File-&gt;Open).
# Start the script (File-&gt;Run Python Script). You should now see the Icarus Import screen.
# Press the ''FSEL'' button, and open the results you exported from Icarus.
# Press the ''Create Curves'' button. This imports the camera motion from the Icarus data and applies it to the Blender default camera.
# Press the ''Feature Points Mesh'' button. This imports 3D shape dots from the Icarus data, which helps as reference when you want to align your own 3D elements to the video footage.

You are now ready to add your own 3D elements to the Blender scene.

==== Phase 3: Compositing 3D Elements on top of Video Footage ====
If you want to easily composite the 3D elements on top of an image, you can add the image as the rendering back buffer in Blender (Scene tab in the Buttons view). However, this doesn't work for videos, so we need another solution.

# In Blender, switch to ''SR:4 - Sequence'' in the layout dropdown menu at the top of the screen.
# In the ''Video Sequence Editor'' view (middle of screen), add your video file (Add-&gt;Movie). Move the new strip to layer 1, frame 1.
# Add the current scene to the sequence (Add-&gt;Scene, Scene). Move the new strip to layer 2, frame 1.
# Select the scene strip on the second layer (right-click).
# Open the ''Scene'' panel in the Buttons view, and then open the ''Sequencer'' sub-panel.
# Change the ''Blend Mode'' dropdown from ''Replace'' to ''Alpha Over''. Your 3D elements should now render over the background video in the top-right preview screen.
# In the Render panel, enable ''Do Sequence'' just below the ANIM button. This will enable the background video when rendering.

=== Troubleshooting ===
* If your imported Feature Points Mesh looks a bit spherical, you need to generate camera distortion data using the Icarus ''Distortion'' application.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Soil is made up of=
*Water and Air 50%
*Minerals 40%
*Biology 5%

=Things to consider above the soil=
*Sun
*Water
*Temperature (Right plant for conditions or build micro climates)
*Shelter design (you should be able to see through your shelter belt)
*Soil compaction
*Breakages (human and animal movement, incorrect pruning, wind fall)
*Competition and companion plants
*Diversity
*Pests and predators

=Things to consider below the soil=
*Balance the mineral content (Physical, clay, sand, salt and all elements)
*Ensure correct soil biology organisms
*Feed soil biology

=Observing soil=
==Colour==
* Colourless/white: high silica content
* Light/white: lack of oxygen; leached; high calcium; alkaline ph
* Yellow: lack of oxygen; high clay content; aluminium &amp; iron
* Red: iron oxide
* Red/brown: volcanic basalt origin; iron &amp; magnesium
* Black: rich in organic matter &amp; nutrients; holds moisture

==Vegetation==

* Azalea, dandelion: acid soils; usually leached; often compacted.
* Berries, conifers, dock: Poor drainage
* Saltbush, spinifex: alkaline; saline; dry soils
* clovers, vetch, nettles: excess nitrogen; low humus content; low micr-organism content
* blackberries: open disturbed soil, possibly acid
* bracken: recent fire; general decline in soil fertility.      
* buttercup: poor drainage, acid.
* thistles: low calcium &amp; iron content; hard soils.
* chicory, chickweed: good fertility

==Parent Material==
Eg soils derived from:

* Sandstone: sandy, high silica.          
* Shale: clay; high silica &amp; iron.
* Basalt:  high iron &amp; magnesium.

==Smell==

* Sour:  Lacks oxygen, acidic, sulphur dioxide
* Sweet &amp; earthy: high oxygen, good soil life &amp; OM
* Garlic:  arsenic in soil (or maybe theres some onion weed nearby!)

==Taste==

* Smooth &amp; slippery: acidic, soil water lathers easily
* Weak soda: alkaline/mineral; won’t lather easily

==Life==

* Worms: good moisture, OM, low pesticide residues
* Ants: drier, sandy
* Slugs &amp; snails: damp, decomposing plant &amp; animal material.
* Skinks &amp; lizards: warm sunny, dry spots, good insect populations

==Water==

* Run –off: is increased by bare ground, compaction, steep slopes
* Repels water: compacted, eroded, excessive use of dolomite, very little OM, sandy &amp; allowed to dry out &amp; has formed a moisture resistant barrier
* Shrinks &amp; swells: high clay, holds water, cracks.
* Fast draining ( hole filled with water, drains within 10mins: erodes easily, collapses easily, few fungal diseases, good movement of water &amp; soil life. Not good for dams.

==History==

* Bare ground: agricultural or industrial contamination.
* Growth in poor soils: previous structures, compaction, old poultry or animal pen site
* No topsoil: quarry or fill site, erosion.
* Bad cracks &amp; rubbish: old tip or landfill site

 
==Plants and soil minerals==
Often plants which grow in deficient soils have the ability to concentrate those missing elements in their structure.

* Potassium present: marshmallow, knapweed, wormwood, opium poppy, fumitory, tansy &amp; borage.
* Deficient: red clover. Celery &amp; leek like potassium. Chicory is pot. rich.
* Calcium: buckwheat grown as a green manure or composted adds. Melon leaves are a source of it &amp; oak bark is especially rich all thistles &amp; willow. Dandelion “mines” it . Peas, beans, brassicas &amp; turnips need it.
* Phosphorous: bracken indicates a lack of &amp; accumulates it. Burn it &amp; spread the ashes. Valerian &amp; comfrey are rich sources. Whitefly indicates a deficiency along with magnesium. Brassicas need it to head well.
* Iron: blackberry is a rich source.
* Magnesium &amp; sulphur: broom, salad burnett, plantain, &amp; sheep sorrel (for magnesium)
* Ragwort: copper
* Thistles: nitrogen, copper &amp; silicon.

=How do we balance the minerals of soil?=
*Look for indicator plants which will tell things about Nitrogen Phosphorus and Potasium
*Look at leaves for signs of deficiencies or excesses (Permaculture Designers Manual has a simple key to follow)
*Get a soil test done
*Book - The Soul of Soil
*DCC Website has soil analysis maps
*Talk to people
*Don't rely on simple 'acid' or 'alkaline' measures. The treatment for these can be too simplistic and might not balance the soil.

=Some Ways to Improve Your Soils=
* Plant mulch making plants ~ comfrey, tree lucerne, grasses for hay, weeds such as dandelion, plantain, nettles, borage, deciduous trees.
* Use small prunings as part of the mulch around your trees. Place them over soil that you need to add organic matter to &amp; put grass clippings, weeds, &amp; manure on top &amp; let nature do the rest. Once its reasonably broken down sow seeds/plant. Good way to establish an orchard/food forest.
* Harvest local resources ~ bracken &amp; chicory are high in potassium, add it to your compost, burn it &amp; use the ashes around plants such as, celery &amp; leeks. The brassicas (cabbage, cauli, brocoli) need phosphorous to head up well, comfrey &amp; bracken supply it. Ragwort concentrates copper. Broom is high in magnesium &amp; sulphur, lupins in nitrogen &amp; calcium. Seaweed has many of the essential trace elements that plants need. Food scraps from cafes &amp; super markets.
* Plant wind breaks to filter air-born pollution
* Plant trees &amp; shrubs to take up ground water pollution e.g alongside a road, runoff from your nieghbour who uses chemicals.
* Create wet lands planted with macrophytes ( reeds &amp; rushes) to take up the above pollution.
* Use raised beds for growing in.
* Seaweed, compost &amp; dolomite help to clean soils of pollutants such as heavy metals.
* Allow weeds to grow ~ add OM, take up pollutants.
* Spread rock dust to supply minerals ~ basalt, granite, dolomite.
* Remember that the more conditions you create for soil life to thrive the better your soils will be. Create diversity.

=Notes on soil=

*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_food_web Soil food web]

*Feed the soil and land base and you will indirectly feed your plants
*Arden Anderson = Soil sciences writer and speaker
*Why is it that plants that are healthy tend not to be attacked by pests and diseases? Their defense system is in tact. A plant that is unhealthy or stressed will be full of simple carbohydrates - which attract pests and diseases. Healthy plants have complex carbohydrates which humans require. Therefore, nature has a way to clean up weak systems.
*Arden Anderson started to observe a relationship between human disease and crop diseases, because of our industrial productions methods that prevent natures way of cleaning out weak species - and so we are interrupting our access to complex carbohydrates.
*How then do we ensure healthy plants?

==Things to do==
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compost Compost] and spread or inoculate areas during planting 30g per m2
*Site specific compost made of the materials of the plants being nurtured
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodynamics Biodynamics]
*Apply seaweed and fish 300g per m2
*3 comfry plants per fruit tree
*For some pests consider using micro organisms from [Bokashi http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokashi] to out compete pests

&lt;big&gt;'''Melanoma Staging'''&lt;/big&gt;



==Clark Levels==
*Level I - Confined to epidermis (in situ); not an invasive lesion
*Level II - Invasion of papillary dermis; invasion past basement membrane
*Level III - Papillary dermis filled by tumor and reticular dermis compressed, but not invaded
*Level IV - Invasion of reticular dermis; subcutaneous tissue not involved
*Level V - Invasion of subcutaneous tissue


*'''Univ Pennsylvania; 1989''' PMID 2593166 -- &quot;Model predicting survival in stage I melanoma based on tumor progression.&quot; (Clark WH Jr, J Natl Cancer Inst. 1989 Dec 20;81(24):1893-904.)
**Prognostic model for primary, clinical Stage I cutaneous melanoma. Clark levels defined
 

==Current staging==

:''Note:'' ulceration (b) upstages by one grouping

&lt;br&gt;''Pathologic Stage Grouping:''
&lt;p&gt;Includes information obtained from lymphadenectomy
&lt;p&gt;Same as clinical staging except for Stage III

Satellite metastases: defined as intralymphatic metastases occurring within 2 cm of primary melanoma
&lt;br&gt;In-transit metastases: more than 2 cm from primary melanoma but before the first echelon of regional lymph nodes

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'''AJCC 5th edition (1997)''' &lt;br&gt;
T stage was based primary on Clark level of invasion. Used Breslow thickness as a secondary prognostic factor: with different thresholds of 0.75, 1.5, and 4 mm. Did not include ulceration. Satellite mets were in the T-stage. Thick (&gt;4mm) melanomas were Stage III, not IIC. For N-stage used size not number of mets. Did not use microscopic vs macroscopic. Did not have separate M stage for lung mets. Did not use LDH.

==Survival==
10-year OS: (estimated from graph, AJCC staging manual)
*Stage IA: 90%, IB: 80%
*Stage IIA: 65%, IIB: 50%, IIC: 35%
*Stage III: 35%
*Stage IV: &lt; 10%</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Malignant Melanoma Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*Lentigo maligna - type of melanoma in-situ, induced by long-term cumulative UV injury. Slow horizontal growth of atypical melanocytes, that are partially replacing the basal layer of epidermis, with no evidence of dermal invasion
*Lentigo maligna melanoma (10-15%) - arise from lentigo maligna precursor lesion. Most benign behavior. Occupational sun exposure, frequently on head and neck. Typically in the elderly
*Superficial spreading melanoma (70%) - often arise from a pigmented dysplastic nevus. Associated with intermittent sun exposure, most common on trunk and extremities. Initial radial growth over many years has 5% metastatic potential; following vertical growth has 35-80% metastatic potential
*Nodular melanoma (10-15%) - most malignant type. Arises de novo. Early vertical growth.
*Acral lentiginous melanoma (5%) - occur on palms, soles, and subungal areas. High incidence in blacks, asians, and hispanics. Commonly metastatic
*Desmoplastic melanoma (1-3%) - pronounced neurotropism, and locally aggressive behavior. Frequent local recurrences, but lymph and distal mets are rare. Often amelanotic
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Melanoma/Mucosal|mucosal melanoma]] (1%) - arise from mucosal epithelium of respiratory, GI and GU tracts
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Eye/Ocular_melanoma|ocular melanoma]] (5%) - arise mostly in uvea or conjunctiva


*'''NCDB; 1998''' (1985-1994) PMID 9781962 -- &quot;The National Cancer Data Base report on cutaneous and noncutaneous melanoma: a summary of 84,836 cases from the past decade. The American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer and the American Cancer Society.&quot; (Chang AE, Cancer. 1998 Oct 15;83(8):1664-78.)
**Population study. 84,836 cases of melanom reported to National Cancer Data Base
**Outcome: cutaneous 91.2%, ocular 5.2%, mucosal 1.3%, unknown primary 2.2%
**Cutaneous: Stage 0 15%, Stage I 48%, Stage II 23%, Stage III 9%, Stage IV 5%
**Ocular: uveal 85%, conjunctival 5%, other sites 10%
**Mucosal: H&amp;N 55%, female genital tract 18%, anal/rectal 24%, urinary tract 3%

==Lentigo maligna==
*Subtype of melanoma in-situ
*Usually occurs in elderly patients, usually on the face
*Slow horizontal growth. May progress to lentigo maligna melanoma
*Treatment is surgery with negative margins. When surgery is undesirable, RT or topical Imiquimod may be used

==Prevention==
'''''Sunscreen:'''''
*'''Australia''' (1992-6) No PMID yet -- &quot;Reduced Melanoma After Regular Sunscreen Use: Randomized Trial Follow-Up&quot; (Green AC, J Clin Oncol online early release 6 December 2010)
**1621 pts (ages 25-75) randomized to daily vs discretionary use of sunscreen application to head and arms in combination with beta carotene or placebo supplements. Followed through 2006. 
**11 new primary melanomas in the daily sunscreen group vs 22 in the discretionary group (HR=0.50). Reduction in invasive melanomas (3 vs 11) was substantial compared with preinvasive melanomas.
**Conclusion: Melanoma may be preventable by regular sunscreen use in adults.

==Adjuvant systemic therapy==
'''''Interferon alfa 2b:'''''
*'''EORTC 18952''', 2005 (1996-2000) - PMID 16198768 &amp;mdash; &quot;Post-surgery adjuvant therapy with intermediate doses of interferon alfa 2b versus observation in patients with stage IIb/III melanoma (EORTC 18952): randomised controlled trial.&quot; Eggermont AM et al. The Lancet 2005; 366:1189-1196.
**1388 pts. Thickness &gt; 4mm, Stage IIb-III. Randomized to 1) 13 months or 2) 25 months of IFN-alfa-2b vs 3) observation. 
**Median f/u 4.6 yrs. For 25-month group, 7.2% increase in distant metastases free interval (S.S.) and 5.4% increase in OS (p=0.12); for 13-month, N.S. difference for DMFI and OS. 18% of pts went off study due to toxicity or refusal of treatment.
**Conclusion: does not improve outcome.

Autoimmunity as a prognostic factor:
*'''Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group''', 2006 (1998-2004) &amp;mdash; &quot;Prognostic Significance of Autoimmunity during Treatment of Melanoma with Interferon.&quot; Gogas H et al. N Engl J Med Feb 16 2006; 354:709-718.
**200 pts (subgroup of a larger study) receiving interferon alfa-2b after surgery for Stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma. Tested blood for the presence of antithyroid, antinuclear, anti-DNA, and anticardiolipin autoantibodies before and after treatment.
**Median f/u 45 mo. Autoantibodies in 26% of pts. 108 of 148 pts without autoantibodies had a relapse (median RFS 16 mo) vs 7 of 52 pts with autoantibodies (median RFS not reached). Median time to detection of autoantibodies was after 3 mo of treatment.
**Conclusion: development of autoimmunity was an indepedent prognostic factor for improved RFS and OS.

==Supportive Care==
*'''Denmark Psychoeducation''' (1991-2001) 
**Randomized. 262 patients, primary malignant melanoma, T1-4N1-2aM0. Arm 1) control vs. Arm 2) six weekly 2-hour sessions of psychoeducation. Replication study of UCLA study
**'''2007''' PMID 18089864 -- &quot;Survival after a psychoeducational intervention for patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma: a replication study.&quot; (Boesen EH, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Dec 20;25(36):5698-703.)
***Outcome: No difference for OS or for recurrence; however, nonparticipants had 2x higher death rate
***Conclusion: Psychoeducation doesn't increase survival

*'''UCLA''' (1985-1986)
**Randomized. 68 patients. Stage I-II melanoma, surgical treatment only (wide excision, some with LND). Arm 1) controls vs. Arm 2) 6 week structured psychiatric group intervention
**'''1993''' PMID 8357293 -- &quot;Malignant melanoma. Effects of an early structured psychiatric intervention, coping, and affective state on recurrence and survival 6 years later.&quot; (Fawzy FI, Arch Gen Psychiatry. 1993 Sep;50(9):681-9.)
***Outcome: Death rate control 29% vs. intervention 9% (SS); recurrence rate 38% vs. 21%
***Poor predictors: male, greater Breslow depth
***Conclusion: Psychiatric intervention had beneficial impact on survival

==Treatment toxicity==
'''''Lymphedema after radiotherapy:'''''
&lt;br&gt;''Using hypofractionated RT''
&lt;br&gt;At 5-yrs (needing compressive device, surgery, or medical treatment):
*Cervical - 11%
*Axillary - 30%
*Groin - 39%

&lt;big&gt;'''Metastatic Melanoma'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
Prognostic factors:
*Balch et al, 1983 - PMID 6668496 &amp;mdash; &quot;A multifactorial analysis of melanoma. IV. Prognostic factors in 200 melanoma patients with distant metastases (stage III).&quot; Balch CM et al. J Clin Oncol. 1983 Feb;1(2):126-34.


==Systemic therapy==
*Dacarbazine - standard of care


==Metastatic to brain==
===Epidemiology===
Brain metastases are common in melanoma, with brain involvement found on autopsy in 49-73% of those who die from melanoma &lt;ref&gt;PMID 665907 - Patel et al. Metastatic pattern of malignant melanoma. A study of 216 autopsy cases.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PMID 6850649 - de la Monte et al. Patterned distribution of metastases from malignant melanoma in humans.&lt;/ref&gt;.  10% of pts with melanoma ultimately develop brain mets&lt;ref name=&quot;sampson&quot;&gt;PMID 9420067 - Sampson et al. Demographics, prognosis, and therapy in 702 patients with brain metastases from malignant melanoma.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Melanoma is the third most common cause of brain mets (after lung and breast). Brain mets present in 6.7% of pts with melanoma at the time of diagnosis&lt;ref name=&quot;fourth&quot;&gt;PMID 15051777&lt;/ref&gt;.  Brain mets more common in males (2/3 of cases are in men)&lt;ref name=&quot;fourth&quot; /&gt;.  Those with brain mets were more likely to be male; have a primary lesion on the trunk, head and neck, or mucosa; or have a thick or ulcerated primary lesion.  Limb primaries have a low chance of metastasizing to the brain.  Median time from diagnosis of primary lesion to development of brain mets was 3.7 years&lt;ref name=&quot;sampson&quot; /&gt;.

===Radiotherapy===
*Doses: 30 Gy in 10, or 20 Gy in 5.
*May be better outcomes for patients treated more aggressively, but that may also be due in part to selection bias. 

===Outcome===

**Purpose is to determine prognostic factors.  Used the database of the Sydney Melanoma Unit, which contains more than 21,000 pts treated since 1952.  1137 pts with brain mets from 1952-2000.  Restricted this study to the subgroup of 686 pts with brain mets diagnosed between 1985 (when CT scanning became available) and 2000.
**Median survival surgery+XRT, 8.9 months; surgery alone, 8.7 mo.; XRT alone, 3.4 mo.; supportive care only, 2.1 mo.  By multivariate analysis, the type of treatment and the presence of other metastases were the most important predictors of survival.

&lt;big&gt;'''Melanoma: Management of the Primary Site'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Primary Surgery==
*Wide excision, with clinical margin depending on Breslow thickness:
**In situ: 0.5 cm
**&lt;=1 mm: 1.0 cm
**1-2 mm: 1.0 - 2.0 cm
**&gt;2 mm: 2.0 cm
*Sentinel lymph node biopsy for lesions &gt; 1 mm thick
*For lesions &lt; 1 mm thick, SLN biopsy is not routine, but should be considered if LVI, mitotic rate &gt; 0, or Clark level IV-V, or young age.


===Randomized===
*'''UK Melanoma Study Group''' (1993-2001) -- surgical margin 1 cm vs. 3 cm
**Randomized. 900 patients, high risk melanoma, thickness &gt;=2.0 mm, trunk or limbs. Excluded palms and soles. Arm 1) 1 cm excision margin vs. Arm 2) 3 cm excision margin. ELND or SLND or adjuvant therapy not allowed.
**'''2004''' PMID 14973217  &amp;mdash; &quot;Excision margins in high-risk malignant melanoma.&quot; (Thomas JM, N Engl J Med. 2004 Feb 19;350(8):757-66.) Median F/U 5 years
***Outcome: local recurrence 1 cm 3.3% vs. 3 cm 2.9% (NS), in-transit/nodal recurrence 32% vs. 28%. No difference in DSS or OS. Median OS after locoregional recurrence 28 months vs. 18 months (p=0.05) 
***Conclusion: Higher locoregional recurrence rate with 1 cm margins in high risk melanomas, but no difference on survival

*'''Intergroup Melanoma Surgical Trial''' (1983-89) -- surgical margin 2 cm vs 4 cm
**Randomized. 468 patients intermediate thickness (1.0-4.0 mm) melanoma, on trunk or proximal extremity. Arm 1) 2cm surgical margin vs Arm 2) 4 cm surgical margin. Secondary randomization to observation vs ELND (see below). Also, nonrandomized 272 patients with distal extremity or H&amp;N enrolled prospectively to 2 cm excision (Group B)
**'''2001''' PMID 11258773 (Free full text) &amp;mdash; &quot;Long-term results of a prospective surgical trial comparing 2 cm vs. 4 cm excision margins for 740 patients with 1-4 mm melanomas.&quot; (Balch CM et al. Ann Surg Oncol. 2001 Mar;8(2):101-8.) Median F/U 10 years
***Outcome: surgical margin 2 cm 0.4% vs. 4cm 0.9% (NS), anytime failure 2.1% vs. 2.6% (NS). 10-year DSS 70% vs. 77% (NS). LR profoundly affected by presence of ulceration (RR approx 6)
***LR impact: LR strongly associated with survival. 5-yr OS of 9% for pts with LR as first relapse (n=13), 11% for any LR (n=28), vs 5-yr OS 86% if no LR. Higher LR for head/neck 9.4%, vs 5.3% dist ext, 3.1% trunk, 1.1% prox ext. Patient who had LR all died of melanoma within 10 years.
***Conclusion: 2 cm margins are safe for intermediate thickness melanomas 

*'''Swedish Melanoma Study Group''' (1982-1990) -- surgical margin 2 cm vs 5 cm
**Randomized. 769 patients, intermediate thickness (0.9 - 2.0 cm). Excluded H&amp;N, distal extremities, vulva. Arm 1) resection margin 2 cm vs. Arm 2) resection margin 5 cm
**'''1996''' PMID 8646678 -- &quot;Resection margins of 2 versus 5 cm for cutaneous malignant melanoma with a tumor thickness of 0.8 to 2.0 mm: randomized study by the Swedish Melanoma Study Group.&quot; (Ringborg U, Cancer. 1996 May 1;77(9):1809-14.) Median F/U 5.8 years
***Outcome: Local recurrence 2 cm 0.8% vs. 5 cm 1.0% (NS) No difference in DFS, DSS, or OS
***Conclusion: Recommend excision margin of 2 cm

*'''France/UK''' (1981-2000) -- surgical margin 2 cm vs. 5 cm 
**Randomized. 337 patients, melanoma &lt;=2.0 cm. Excluded age &gt;70, toe/nail/finger, and acral melanoma. Arm 1) 2 cm excision vs. Arm 2) 5 cm excision. Second randomization for adjuvant isoprinosine
**'''2003''' PMID 12673721 -- &quot;Surgical margins in cutaneous melanoma (2 cm versus 5 cm for lesions measuring less than 2.1-mm thick).&quot; (Khayat D, Cancer. 2003 Apr 15;97(8):1941-6.) Median F/U 16 years
***Outcome: Local recurrence 2 cm 0.6% vs. 5 cm 1.8 cm (NS). Median TTR 3.5 years. 10-year DFS 85% vs. 83% (NS). No difference for second randomization.
***Conclusion: Surgical margin of 2 cm sufficient for melanoma &lt;=2 mm

*'''WHO Melanoma Programme Trial #10''' (1980-?) -- surgical margin 1 cm vs 3 cm
**Randomized. 612 patients with clinical Stage I melanoma, thickness &lt;=2 mm. Facial or digital melanoma excluded. Arm 1) 1 cm surgical margin vs. Arm 2) 3 cm surgical margin
**'''1991''' PMID 2009058 -- &quot;Narrow excision (1-cm margin). A safe procedure for thin cutaneous melanoma.&quot; (Veronesi U, Arch Surg. 1991 Apr;126(4):438-41.). Mean F/U 8 years
***Outcome: Local recurrence 1cm 1.3% vs 3 cm 0% (NS). 8-year OS 1cm 90% vs. 3 cm 90% (NS); DFS 82% vs. 84% (NS). First event most frequently nodal relapse (7%).
***Conclusion: Narrow 1cm excision as effective as wide excision


===Retrospective===
*'''Sydney Melanoma Unit; 2005''' (1951-1996) PMID 15650644 -- &quot;Histopathologic excision margin affects local recurrence rate: analysis of 2681 patients with melanomas &lt; or =2 mm thick.&quot; (McKinnon JG, Ann Surg. 2005 Feb;241(2):326-33.)
**Retrospective. 2681 patients, cutaneous melanoma &lt;=2mm. SM-. Median F/U 7 years
**Outcome: 10-year LR 2.9%, predictors for LR were margin of excision and thickness. If margin 1cm excluded, margin status no longer significant. LR margin &lt;8mm 3.8% vs. 8-15mm 1.6%. Margin status not predictive of survival
**Conclusion: Pathologic margin affected risk of LR, but only if &lt;1 cm clinical. It does not affect survival

*'''MD Anderson; 1998''' (1985-1996) PMID 9641453 -- &quot;Surgical margins and prognostic factors in patients with thick (&gt;4mm) primary melanoma.&quot; (Heaton KM, Ann Surg Oncol. 1998 Jun;5(4):322-8.)
**Retrospective. 278 patients, thick primary melanoma &gt;4 mm (median 6.0 mm), ulceration 57%. Median F/U 2.2 years
**Outcome: LR 12%. LR or margin width not associated with DFS or OS, but nodal status, thickness, and ulceration was
**Conclusion: 2cm margin sufficient

===Desmoplastic and/or Neurotropic Melanoma===
*Desmoplastic melanomas were initially believed to have a high recurrence rate (~50% in early literature review from 1995). This may have been related to high rate of neurotropism, and high frequency with H&amp;N location, which may compromise surgical margins
*However, desmoplastic melanoma with appropriate surgical resection appears to have local recurrence rate of 4-7%. 
*Neurotropic desmoplastic melanoma had historically local recurrence of 20-30%, but Michigan data suggest low recurrence rate with appropriate surgical margins
*Role of initial adjuvant RT is not clear, but may be reasonable if SM are &lt;1cm or with neurotropism. Whether RT has any impact on development of distant disease and overall survival has not been established


*'''Queensland Melanoma Project, Australia; 2008''' (1997-2006) PMID 18366400 -- &quot;Desmoplastic melanoma: the role of radiotherapy in improving local control.&quot; (Foote MC, ANZ J Surg. 2008 Apr;78(4):273-6.)
**Retrospective. 24 patients with desmoplastic melanoma, surgical excision followed by postop RT. Median thickness 5.2 mm. SM &lt;1 cm in 71% patients
**Outcome: 3-year in-field RFS 91%, OS 83%
**Conclusion: Adjuvant RT may have been effective in reducing rate of local recurrence

*'''Sydney Melanoma Unit, Australia''' 
**'''2008''' (1996-2007) PMID 18823042 -- &quot;Desmoplastic neurotropic melanoma: a clinicopathologic analysis of 128 cases.&quot; (Chen JY, Cancer. 2008 Nov 15;113(10):2770-8.)
***Retrospective. 128 patients with desmoplastic neurotropic melanoma. Wide local excision. Median thickness 4 mm. SM &gt;0.5 cm in 70%, &gt;1 cm in 40%. Adjuvant RT in 21% (typically for thicker tumors (median thickness 7 mm), H&amp;N locations, and close surgical margins). RT 33/6 or 50/25
***Outcome: local recurrence surgery 6% vs surgery + RT 7%. No LR with surgery only if SM &gt;1cm. Predictors were SM+ and H&amp;N location. DM surgery 17% vs. surgery + RT 11%. 
***Conclusion: Local recurrence lower than historical controls. When margins compromised (possibly &lt;1cm), RT may reduce local recurrence
**'''1998''' (1979-1995) PMID 9740077 -- &quot;Desmoplastic and desmoplastic neurotropic melanoma: experience with 280 patients.&quot; (Quinn MJ, Cancer. 1998 Sep 15;83(6):1128-35.)
***Retrospective. 280 patients (desmoplastic melanoma 190, desmoplasti neurotropic melanoms 90). Male-female 1.7:1, median thickness 2.5 mm, amelanotic 44%
***Outcome: 5-year OS 75%. Local recurrence 11%, regional/in-transit 12%, distnat mets 14%. Desmoplastic melanoma LR 7% vs. desmoplastic neurotropic melanoma 20% vs. historical overall melanoma 3%. As a function of thickness, comparable recurrence rate for desmoplastic melanoma. LR higher if SM &lt;1 cm or if neurotropism present
***Conclusion: Comparable survival between DM, DNM, and other cutaneous melanomas. Lower rate of LN mets

**Retrospective. 49/65 patients with cutaneous desmoplastic melanoma. Wide excision (&gt;2 cm in 63%, &gt;1cm in 100%), most H&amp;N patients required reconstruction. No RT given. Mean thickness 4.2 mm, 38% had thickness &gt;4 mm. Neurotropism in 32%. Mean F/U 3.7 years, minimum 2 years
**Outcome: Local recurrence 4% (1 neurotropic, 1 not). LN mets no neurotropism 4% vs neurotropism 28% (SS)
**Conclusion: Local recurrence considerably less than historically reported; careful attention to appropriate margins produces excellent local control

*'''University of Florida; 2005''' PMID 16062083 -- &quot;Neurotropic melanoma of the head and neck with clinical perineural invasion.&quot; (Newlin HE, Am J Clin Oncol. 2005 Aug;28(4):399-402.)
**Retrospective. 3 patients with clinical perineural invasion. 2 patients incomplete resection, and received definitive RT 74.4 Gy BID. 1 patient postop RT after multiple recurrences of desmoplastic neurotropic melanoma.
**Conclusion: RT may provide relatively long-term local control in patients with clinical perineural invasion

*'''UCLA; 2003''' (1976-1997) PMID 12784232 -- &quot;Efficacy of radiation therapy in the local control of desmoplastic malignant melanoma.&quot; (Vongtama R, Head Neck. 2003 Jun;25(6):423-8.)
**Retrospective. 44 patients, desmoplastic melanoma, H&amp;N 68%, neurotropism 48%. Local recurrence in 21/44 (48%), and extent of SM couldn't be determined. 14/21 local recurrences received postop RT (32% overall). Median dose 50 Gy (44-66 Gy), no regional LN coverage. Indications for RT: R2 resection, R1 resection, deliberate close SM, surgical concern about adequacy of resection, or multiply recurrent tumor
**Outcome: Local recurrence RT 0% vs. no RT 57% (SS). DM rate comparable no RT 35% vs. RT 40% (NS). No difference in recurrence rate by neurotropism. Local control in 4/4 patients with R1/R2 disease
**Conclusion: Postop RT effective in recurrent disease; consider RT as part of initial adjuvant treatment; consider RT as primary treatment if cannot clear margins

**Retrospective. 28 patients, desmoplastic neurotropic melanoma. Most H&amp;N (75%) and amelanotic (57%), associated LM in 56%. Mean thickness 4.1 mm.
**Outcome: Local recurrence 27%, visceral mets 11%, survival 81%. Literature review composite LR 50% (22-77%)
**Conclusion: Present at more advanced stage locally, but may be associated with better survival stage for stage


==Adjuvant RT to Primary Site==
*'''Sydney Melanoma Unit, Australia; 2000''' (1989-98) - PMID 10618610 &amp;mdash; &quot;Locally advanced melanoma: results of postoperative hypofractionated radiation therapy.&quot; (Stevens G, Cancer. 2000 Jan 1;88(1):88-94.)
**Retrospective. 174 patients treated with postop RT (primary n=35, or lymph nodes n=139). RT 33/6 over 18 days. Median F/U 2.5 years
***For primary site (Group A): RT given initially (n=11) or after recurrence and re-exsision (n=21). Indications: SM+, SM close, desmoplastic histology, PNI, satellitosis, early/multiple recurrences
***For adjuvant LN (Group B): RT given initially (n=107) or after recurrence (n=35). Indications: SM+, ECE, multiple LN+, large LNs, PNI, LVI, parotid node involvement
**Outcome: In-field local recurrence 11%. Recurrence rate if RT given in &lt;18 days 4% vs. &gt;=18 days 15% (p=0.06). 5-year OS Group A 49% vs. Group B 38% (p=0.07)
**Toxicity: symptomatic lymphedema 58%, worse if initial dissection. 
**Conclusion: Postop RT improved local control compared with published series. Adjuvant RT should be considered for high risk patients, including SM+, desmoplasia with neurotropism, multiple LN+, and large LN with ECE

==Definitive RT==
===Lentigo maligna &amp; Lentigo maligna melanoma===
*Surgical excision would be considered the first line treatment
*However, in elderly patients large lesions can often be present on the face, and radiotherapy may be warranted if they have significant comorbidities
*Historically, Grenz or soft X-ray therapy was used, with success rate &gt;90%
**In Europe, the Miescher technique was popular, involving contact therapy (50% depth dose 1mm) and use of very high doses
*Lesions may take up to 2 years to completely regress, and careful clinical follow up is required

&lt;big&gt;'''Melanoma: Management of regional lymphatics'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Evaluation of regional lymphatics==
===Elective LND vs Delayed LND===
*Overall, no survival benefit for performing immediate LND vs observation/delayed LND
*Results from WHO Melanoma Trial #14 suggested that for patients who have LN disease, immediate LND improves survival over delayed LND
*Planned subgroup analysis of the Intergroup Melanoma trial showed survival benefit for intermediate risk patients (non-ulcerated, thickness 1.0-2.0 mm, or located in extremity). It was felt that high risk patients (ulcerated, thickness &gt;2.0 mm, and trunk) are at high risk of distant failure, and immediate LND does not provide significant benefit


*'''Intergroup Melanoma Surgical Trial''' (1983-1989) -- elective LND vs. observation
**Randomized.  740 patients, Stage I-II melanoma, intermediate Breslow thickness (1.0-4.0 mm). WLE minimum margin 2cm. . Planned subgroup analysis based on previously known risk factors
**'''2000''' PMID 10761786 (Free full text) &amp;mdash; &quot;Long-term results of a multi-institutional randomized trial comparing prognostic factors and surgical results for intermediate thickness melanomas (1.0 to 4.0 mm). Intergroup Melanoma Surgical Trial.&quot; (Balch CM, Ann Surg Oncol. 2000 Mar;7(2):87-97.) Median F/U 10 years
***Outcome: 10-year OS ELND 77% vs. observation 73% (NS). In non-ulcerated subgroup, ELND 84% vs observation 77% (SS). In thinner subgroup (Breslow 1.0-2.0), ELND 86% vs. observation 80% (SS). In extremity subgroup, ELND 84% vs. observation 78% (p=0.05)
***Negative predictors: Breslow thickness, ulceration, age &gt;60
***Conclusion: No benefit overall; however, survival benefit for select patient populations (non-ulcerated, thickness 1.0-2.0, extremity).

*'''WHO Melanoma Trial #14''' (1982-1989) -- immediate LND vs delayed LND
**Randomized. 240 patients. Trunk melanoma, Breslow thickness &gt;=1.5 mm (median 3.3 mm). WLE with 3cm margin. Arm 1) immediate LND vs. Arm 2) delayed LND until clinical metastases
**'''1998''' PMID 9519951 -- &quot;Immediate or delayed dissection of regional nodes in patients with melanoma of the trunk: a randomised trial. WHO Melanoma Programme.&quot; (Cascinelli N, Lancet. 1998 Mar 14;351(9105):793-6.) Mean F/U 11 years
***Outcome: 5-year OS delayed LND 51% vs. immediate LND 62% (NS)
***LN Status: LN+ in delayed LND 37% vs. immediate LND 22%. Median TTF 8 months. Survival of patients with immediate LN+ better than with delayed LN+ (p=0.04)
***Conclusion: No difference. However, immediate LND offers improved survival in patients with LN mets
**Comment: No lymphoscintigraphy to determine draining lymph node basin; substantial proportion of thickness &gt;4.0 mm lesions which are at high risk of distant mets

*'''Mayo Clinic''' (1971-1976) -- immediate LND vs delayed LND
**Randomized, 3 arms. 173 patients, localized malignant melanoma. Arm 1) delayed LND until clinical progression vs Arm 2) delayed LND 3 months after primary surgery vs. Arm 3) immediate LND. H&amp;N and midline lesions excluded. Breslow depth &lt;1.5mm in 57%

***Outcome: 5-year OS delayed LND 63% vs. short delayed LND 56% vs. immediate LND 54% (NS)
***LN Status: LN+ in delayed LND 16% vs short delayed LND 9% vs. immediate LND 4%
***Conclusion: Elective LND not beneficial in management of melanoma
**'''1986''' PMID 3747613 -- &quot;Lymphadenectomy in the management of stage I malignant melanoma: a prospective randomized study.&quot; (Sim FH, Mayo Clin Proc. 1986 Sep;61(9):697-705.)
***Outcome: No difference in OS or DMFS
***Prognostic factors: level of invasion, thickness
***Conclusion: No difference

*'''WHO Cooperative Trial #1''' (1967-1974) -- immediate LND vs delayed LND
**Randomized. 553 patients, Stage I (T1-3N0) melanoma of the extremities (83% lower extremities), Breslow thickness &gt;=1mm in 90%, &gt;=4mm in 31%. Satellite nodules permitted. Tumors &gt;5 cm excluded. Wide local excision with at least 3cm margin. Arm 1) immediate LND vs Arm 2) delayed LND until clinically positive LNs detected. For lower extremity, inguino-illiac LND; for upper extremity, axillary en bloc resection including pectoralis minor
**'''1982''' PMID 7074555 -- &quot;Delayed regional lymph node dissection in stage I melanoma of the skin of the lower extremities.&quot; (Veronesi U, Cancer. 1982 Jun 1;49(11):2420-30.) Follow-up 7-13 years
***Outcome: 5-year OS immediate LND 68% vs delayed LND 69% (NS); 10-year OS 9% vs. 13% (NS). No subset benefited from immediate LND. 
***LN status: Frequency of LN+ in immediate arm 20% vs. frequency of clinical LN failure in delayed arm 22%. Mean TTF 13 months. No survival difference between patients with initially positive LN and with delayed positive LNs. 5-year OS 46% vs. 41% (NS)
***Conclusion: Delayed LND as effective as immediated dissection in Stage I melanoma of extremities

**Retrospective. 141 patients, malignant melanoma, radical LND (axilla 61%, groin 44%). Prior intervention (&quot;tampering&quot;) in 13%. Elective LND 26%, therapeutic LND 51%, positive SLND 24%. Median F/U 3.4 years
**Outcome: Regional recurrence 16%, in-transit mets 11%. Tampering only predictor of regional recurrence 10% vs. 83% (SS), but no impact on OS
**Conclusion: Previous interventions in draining basin increase risk of melanoma recurrence in the surgical field. FNA and SLN are safe

**Retrospective. 104 patients, melanoma to ilioinguinal LNs. Median F/U 10 years
**Prognostic factors: &gt;2 LN+, truncal primary, ilio-inguinal vs inguinal location
**Conclusion: Presence of pelvic mets indicates systemic disease. Local recurrence depend on regional tumor burden

**Retrospective. 217 patients, primary H&amp;N melanoma, who underwent RLND. Postop RT 10%. Median F/U 2.7 years
**Outcome: cervical LN recurrence 14%. 5-year regional control ECE- 87% vs. ECE+ 69% (SS), nonpalpable 96% vs. palpable 87% (p=0.07), 1-3LN+ 82% vs. &gt;3LN+ 91% (NS). On multivariate analysis, ECE+ only predictor. Failure with postop RT 14% (ECE present in 43%) vs. no PORT 14% (ECE present in 23%)
**Conclusion: Low incidence of cervical recurrence doesn't justify RT, except in patients with ECE

Clinical LND 36% vs. elective LND 16%. By size &gt;6 cm 80% vs. 3-6cm 42% vs. &lt;3cm 24% (SS). By number 1-3 LN+ 25% vs. 4-10 LN+ 46% vs. &gt;10 LN+ 63%. No difference if adjuvant systemic therapy given
**Predictors: Number of nodes, elective vs therapeutic LND. If nodal basin failure, risk of DM 87% vs. 54%

***Outcome: 5-year DFS SLNB 78% vs. observation 73% (SS), but this was predominately due to expected nodal relapse in the observation arm. 5-year DSS 87% vs. 87% (NS). LN+ SLNB 16% immediately vs. observation 5-year failure 16% (NS), however, higher LN+ burden in delayed arm SLNB 1.4 vs observation 3.3 (SS) indicating disease progression during observation
***SLN Status: 5-year DSS SLN- 90% vs. SLN+ 72% (SS). If LN+, 5-year DSS SLNB+ 72% vs. observation LN+ 52% (SS). If SLN+, 70% had only that LN+, 28% had 2-3 LN+, and 2% had 4+ LN+
***Conclusion: No overall survival difference. However, staging by SLNB can identify patients with LN+, whose survival is improved by immediate LND
**Lessons learned (from NCCN.org 2009 conference): Similar proportion will recur in regional node basin as that with positive SLN, status of SLN most powerful predictor of outcome in intermediate thickness melanoma, if SLN+ survival better if LNs removed immediately, but there is no improvement in disease-specific survival and thus SLNB is purely a staging procedure. Cost to find one SLN+ is ~$90,000 in intermediate-thickness melanoma

**Population survey. 44,548 patients in National Cancer Data Base, Stage I-III melanoma. SLNB done in 39%; of these 17% SLNB+. 
**Outcome: Completion LND in 50%. Less likely to undergo CLND if &gt;75 years or lower extremity melanoma. Only 42% underwent CLND as a separate procedure (NCCN guideline). 69% had at least 10 LN examined (NCCN guideline)
**Conclusion: Only half of patients undergo completion LND; quality surveillance measures are needed

*'''Multi-Institutional; 2006''' PMID 16604476 -- &quot;Melanoma patients with positive sentinel nodes who did not undergo completion lymphadenectomy: a multi-institutional study.&quot; (Wong SL, Ann Surg Oncol. 2006 Jun;13(6):809-16. Epub 2006 Apr 12.)
**Retrospective. 134 patients with SLN+ without completion LND (patient refusal 49%, patient/physician decision 48%). Median thickness 2.6 mm, 33% ulcerated. Compared with reference 164 patients treated at MSKCC who underwent CLND. Median F/U 20 months &amp; 30 months
**Outcome: Nodal recurrence as component of first recurrence 15% (similar to expected non-SLN rate in patients with SLN+). TTF 11 months. Nodal recurrence-free survival CLND- 80% vs. MSKCC CLND+ 88% (p=0.07), and similar DSS (NS)
**Conclusion: Outcome in SLN+ patients who did not undergo completion LND was comparable to matched patients with completion LND

**Retrospective. 191 patients, SLNB positive and followed by completion LND
**Outcome: Non-SLN+ in 24%. Predictors: Breslow thickness (&gt;=3 mm), SLN size (&gt;=2 mm)
**Model: If 0 risk factors, 12%; if 1 risk factor, 31%; if both risk factors, 42%
**Conclusion: Thicker primary and larger SLN correlate with non-SLN lymph nodes

==RT to regional lymphatics==
*Administration of adjuvant RT to regional lymphatics remains controversial
*Risk of relapse after lymph node dissection is 15-20%, but may be as high as 30-50% with certain high risk factors
*One randomized trial using substandard technique in the mid 1970's showed no benefit. Two further randomized trials in the U.S. were closed due to non-accrual (RTOG 93-02 and ECOG 3697). In Australia/New Zealand, TROG 02.01 has completed aand showed improvement in regional control but not OS or RFS (see below).
*While it appears that adjuvant RT improves regional control, it has no impact on survival. On the other hand, a regional recurrence can be significantly morbid
*Based on multiple surgical series (see above) and retrospective institutional reviews, for now it is probably reasonable to at least discuss adjuvant RT with the following patient subsets:
**Extracapsular extension
**Multiple (&gt;2-4) involved lymph nodes (fewer needed in cervical regions, more in groin regions)
**Large lymph nodes (&gt;=3 cm)
**Recurrent disease after prior complete lymph node dissection


===Randomized===
*'''ANZMTG 1-02 / TROG 02.01 (Australia / New Zealand)''' (2002-2007) -- Observation vs Adjuvant RT
**Randomized. 217 patients, 16 centers. High risk patients: One nodal basin, completely resected. Significant risk for relapse defined as parotid &gt;= 1 LN+, or axilla &gt;= 2 LN+, or groin &gt;=3 LN+, or ECE+, or LN size neck &gt;= 3cm or axilla/groin &gt;= 4cm. RT to nodal basin 48 Gy/20 fx. Relapses in OBS arm could be offered RT. Primary endpoint regional relapse.

**Comparison of 106 Roswell Park pts meeting Ballo criteria (see below), where RT was not delivered, vs 509 MDACC pts who received adjuvant RT after TL if meeting Ballo criteria (30 Gy, 5 fx's over 2.5 weeks).
**Regional recurrence 10% in RT group vs 40% in TL alone group (SS).
**Distant recurrence (55% vs 74%) (SS) and disease-specific survival (30% vs 51%) (SS) improved in RT group
**Conclusion: Adjuvant RT associated w/ improved LC and may impact DSS.

**Retrospective. 56 patients (H&amp;N 87%), high risk disease (recurrent 52%, cervical LNs, lymph nodes &gt;3cm, &gt;3 LN+, ECE, gross residual disease, close/positive SM, satellitosis), treated with adjuvant RT. Hypofractionated RT 30/5 (73%) or conventional with median dose 60/30 (27%). Median F/U 4.4 years
**Outcome: 5-year LRC 87%, CSS 57%, OS 46%. No difference between schedules (p=0.97) for any endpoint. In-field failure worse with satellitosis (SS)
**Toxicity: late toxicity 4% (1 osteoradionecrosis of external auditory canal, 1 radiation plexopathy), both in hypofractionated regimens
**Conclusion: Hypofractionation and conventional fractionation equally efficacious

**Retrospective. 466 patients, nodal mets from melanoma, managed with LND + adjuvant RT. Therapeutic LND in 93%. Systemic therapy in 33%. Median F/U 4.2 years
**Outcome: 5-year regional control 89%, DFS 42%, DMFS 44%, DSS 49%. No predictors of worse regional control. Predictors for DSS number of LN, ulceration
**Toxicity: Grade 2 in 16%, Grade 3 &lt;1%. 10-year symptomatic lymphedema 11%, worse with groin LN (27%)
**Conclusion: Regional disease can be controlled with LND+RT, but risk of DM and melanoma death remains high
**Refined indications: 
***For most patients: ECE+, LN &gt;=3 cm, 4+ LN+, recurrent disease
***For cervical patients: ECE+, smaller LNs, fewer LNs, recurrent disease
***For groin patients: 2 of the high-risk features
***For &gt;10 LN+: 2 of the high-risk features, given their risk of systemic disease is very high

===Graphics object===
A System.Drawing.Graphics object represents a drawing surface. 

To get a Graphics object for a PictureBox control, use the .Graphics property of the PaintEventArgs parameter in the PictureBox's Paint() event.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
    Private Sub PictureBox1_Paint(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs) Handles PictureBox1.Paint
        Using g as Graphics = e.Graphics
            'use the methods of g to draw 
        End Using
    End Sub
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To load an image and then draw on it, use Graphics.FromImage()
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
    Using MyImage As Bitmap = Bitmap.FromFile(&quot;C:\Temp\MyImage.BMP&quot;)
        Using g as Graphics = Graphics.FromImage(MyImage)
            'use the methods of g to draw 
        End Using
    End Using
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The .Save() method can be used to save the Bitmap to a file or a Stream. Note: Bitmap objects created from a file keep the file open and are linked to the file while the object is in use. You will need to copy the file into a MemoryStream first if you do not want the Bitmap object to be linked to the file.

===Drawing Methods===
Use methods such as Graphics.DrawLine and Graphics.DrawString to draw lines and text

===Measurement===
Graphics.MeasureString can be used to measure how tall or wide a piece of text will be when output with .DrawString.

===Scaling===
====Simple scaling====
Use the Graphics.PageUnit property as a simple way to change the coordinate system. More complicated transformations and scaling are described below.

====World, Page and Device coordinate systems====
When you supply coordinates to VB.NET graphics functions, these coordinates are part of the World Coordinate system. The units of the World coordinate system are defined by you, but the default is Pixels.

The World Transformation converts your World coordinates to Page coordinates. Page coordinates can use different units, but are device independent. The idea is that a distance expressed in Page coordinates will be the same if viewed on a monitor, or printed on a page.

The Page Transformation converts Page Coordinates to Device Coordinates. In other words, the Page Transformation ensures that the graphics output looks the same no matter what device the image is sent to. Device Coordinates are usually Pixels.

You can specify a translation matrix to convert the points you specify into the final output. This transformation can translate (offset), scale, rotate or skew the final output. This transformation is called an [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7e1w5dhw%28v=vs.110%29.aspx Affine Transformation].

====Converting from Twips====
Previous versions of Visual Basic used Twips as the unit of measure. 1,440 Twips = 1 inch. However, VB.NET uses Pixels as its unit of measure. To convert from Twips to Pixels requires a Graphics object (since you don't know the number of dots-per-inch). Therefore, if &lt;code&gt;XTwips&lt;/code&gt; is the measurement in Twips, then &lt;code&gt;XPixels&lt;/code&gt;, the measurement in pixels, is calculated as follows (&lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; is the appropriate &lt;code&gt;Graphics&lt;/code&gt; object):
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
    XPixels = XTwips * g.DpiX / 1440
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Use &lt;code&gt;g.DpiY&lt;/code&gt; to calculate coordinates for the Y axis.

0. PREAMBLE
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.) To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.


2. VERBATIM COPYING
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. 
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. 
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. 
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. 
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. 
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. 
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. 
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. 
I. Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. 
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. 
K. For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. 
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. 
M. Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. 
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. 
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. 
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled &quot;Endorsements.&quot;


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.


9. TERMINATION
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 July 2008

Copyright (C) 2008 Free Software Burundi Librestez. &lt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Burundi_Librestez&gt;  

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.
As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.

The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or 
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy. 
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. 
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. 
4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. 
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. 
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document. 
d) Do one of the following: 
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source. 
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version. 
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.) 
5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License. 
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.



GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 July 2008

Copyright © 2008 Free Software Burundi Librestez,  &lt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Burundi_Librestez&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Definitions.
“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.
The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. 
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”. 
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. 
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. 
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. 
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. 
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. 
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. 
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. 
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or 
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or 
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or 
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or 
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or 
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. 
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.

A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.

JavaScript implement numbers as floating point values, that is, they're attaining decimal values as well as whole number values.

==Basic Use==
To make a new number, a simple initialization suffices:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var foo = 0; // or whatever number you want
&lt;/source&gt;
After you have made your number, you can then modify it as necessary.  Numbers can be modified or assigned using the [[JavaScript/Operators|operators]] defined within JavaScript.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
foo = 1; //foo = 1
foo += 2; //foo = 3 (the two gets added on)
foo -= 2; //foo = 1 (the two gets removed)
&lt;/source&gt;

Number literals define the number value. In particular:
* They appear as a set of digits of varying length.
* Negative literal numbers have a minus sign before the set of digits.
* Floating point literal numbers contain one decimal point, and may optionally use the [[w:Scientific Notation#E notation|E notation]] with the character e.
* An integer literal may be prepended with &quot;0&quot;, to indicate that a number is in base-8. (8 and 9 are not octal digits, and if found, cause the integer to be read in the normal base-10).
* An integer literal may also be found with prefixed &quot;0x&quot;, to indicate a hexadecimal number.

==The Math Object==
Unlike strings, arrays, and dates, the numbers aren't objects, so they don't contain any methods that can be accessed by the normal dot notation. Instead a certain Math object provides usual numeric functions and constants as methods and properties. The methods and properties of the Math object are referenced using the ''dot operator'' in the usual way, for example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var varOne = Math.ceil(8.5);
var varPi = Math.PI;
var sqrt3 = Math.sqrt(3);
&lt;/source&gt;

===Methods===
====random()====
Generates a pseudo-random number.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var myInt = Math.random();
&lt;/source&gt;

====max(int1, int2)====
Returns the highest number from the two numbers passed as arguments.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var myInt = Math.max(8, 9);
document.write(myInt); //9
&lt;/source&gt;
====min(int1, int2)====
Returns the lowest number from the two numbers passed as arguments.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var myInt = Math.min(8, 9);
document.write(myInt); //8
&lt;/source&gt;
====floor(float)====
Returns the greatest integer less than the number passed as an argument.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var myInt = Math.floor(90.8);
document.write(myInt); //90;
&lt;/source&gt;
====ceil(float)====
Returns the least integer greater than the number passed as an argument.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var myInt = Math.ceil(90.8);
document.write(myInt); //91;
&lt;/source&gt;
====round(float)====
Returns the closest integer to the number passed as an argument.
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var myInt = Math.round(90.8);
document.write(myInt); //91;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Properties===
Properties of the Math Object are most commonly used constants.
*'''PI:''' Returns the value of pi.
*'''E:''' Returns the constant e.
*'''SQRT2:''' Returns the square root of 2.
*'''LN10:''' Returns the natural logarithm of 10.
*'''LN2:''' Returns the natural logarithm of 2.

[[Category:Prolog]]

== Definition ==

A Difference list in Prolog is a normal list except the very end of it is a logic variable, paired with that variable. For example:

  [a,b,c|E]-E

== Demonstration ==

A common example to explain why they are useful is:

  append(I-M, M-O, I-O).

Given this clause one can query:

  ?- append([a,b,c|E]-E,  [x,y,z|W]-W,  O).
  E = [x, y, z|W],
  O = [a, b, c, x, y, z|W]-W.

Since this uses a single unification to append you have O(1) instead of O(n) complexity.

== Internal to Definite Clause Grammars ==

You can expect a [[Prolog#Definite Clause Grammar|DCG]] to expand into normal Prolog rules which use difference lists, for example.

 ?- expand_term(( o --&gt; [a,b,c] ), E).
 E = (o(I, O) :- I=[a, b, c|O]).

is a valid expansion.

== Examples ==

One of the earlier examples, revappend, can be written using DCG:

 revappend([]) --&gt; [].
 revappend([X|Xs]) --&gt; revappend(Xs), [X].</text>

'''Earthwork''' is something that transportation projects seldom avoid.  In order to establish a properly functional road, the terrain must often be adjusted.  In many situations, geometric design will often involve minimizing the cost of earthwork movement.  Earthwork is expressed in units of volumes (cubic meters in metric).  Increases in such volumes require additional trucks (or more runs of the same truck), which cost money.  Thus, it is important for designers to engineer roads that require very little earthwork.

==Cross Sections and Volume Computation==

[[Image:Cross-section.PNG|thumb|A Roadway Cross Section on otherwise Level Ground | right|350px]]

To determine the amount of earthwork to occur on a given site, one must calculate the volume.  For linear facilities, which include highways, railways, runways, etc., volumes can easily be calculated by integrating the areas of the cross sections (slices that go perpendicular to the centerline) for the entire length of the corridor.  More simply, several cross sections can be selected along the corridor and an average can be taken for the entire length.  Several different procedures exist for calculating areas of earthwork cross sections.  In the past, the popular method was to draw cross sections by hand and use a planimeter to measure area.  In modern times, computers use a coordinate method to assess earthwork calculations.  To perform this task, points with known elevations need to be identified around the cross section.  These points are considered in the (X, Y) coordinate plane, where X represents the horizontal axis paralleling the ground and Y represents the vertical axis that is elevation.  Area can be computed with the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;A = |\frac{{1}}{{2}}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {X_i(Y_{i+1} - Y_{i-1})}|\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;A\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Area of Cross-Section
* &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Number of Points on Cross Section (Note: n+1 = 1 and 1-1=n, for indexing)
* &lt;math&gt;X\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = X-Coordinate
* &lt;math&gt;Y\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Y-Coordinate

With this, earthwork volumes can be calculated.  The easiest means to do so would by using the average end area method, where the two end areas are averaged over the entire length between them.

&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{{A_1 + A_2}}{{2}}L\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;V\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Volume
* &lt;math&gt;A_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Cross section area of first side
* &lt;math&gt;A_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Cross section area of second side
* &lt;math&gt;L\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Length between the two areas

If one end area has a value of zero, the earthwork volume can be considered a pyramid and the correct formula would be:

&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{{AL}}{{3}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

A more accurate formula would the prismoidal formula, which takes out most of the error accrued by the average end area method.

&lt;math&gt;V_p = \frac{{L(A_1 + 4A_m + A_2)}}{{6}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;V_p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Volume given by the prismoidal formula
* &lt;math&gt;A_m\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Area of a plane surface midway between the two cross sections

==Cut and Fill==

[[Image:CutFillDiagram.PNG|thumb|A Typical Cut/Fill Diagram | right|350px]]

Various sections of a roadway design will require bringing in earth.  Other sections will require earth to be removed.  Earth that is brought in is considered '''Fill''' while earth that is removed is considered '''Cut'''.  Generally, designers generate drawings called Cut and Fill Diagrams, which illustrate the cut or fill present at any given site.  This drawing is quite standard, being no more than a graph with site location on the X-axis and fill being the positive range of the Y-axis while cut is the negative range of the Y-axis.

[[Image:MassDiagram.PNG|thumb|A Typical Mass Diagram (Note: Additional Dirt is Needed in this Example) | right|350px]]

==Mass Balance==

Using the data for cut and fill, an overall mass balance can be computed.  The mass balance represents the total amount of leftover (if positive) or needed (if negative) earth at a given site based on the design up until that point.  It is a useful piece of information because it can identify how much remaining or needed earth will be present at the completion of a project, thus allowing designers to calculate how much expense will be incurred to haul out excess dirt or haul in needed additional.  Additionally, a mass balance diagram, represented graphically, can aid designers in moving dirt internally to save money.

Similar to the cut and fill diagram, the mass balance diagram is illustrated on two axes.  The X-axis represents site location along the roadway corridor and the Y-axis represents the amount of earth, either in excess (positive) or needed (negative).

==Examples==

===Example 1: Computing Volume===

{{TProblem |
A roadway is to be designed on a level terrain.  This roadway is 150 meters in length.  Four cross sections have been selected, one at 0 meters, one at 50 meters, one at 100 meters, and one at 150 meters.  The cross sections, respectively, have areas of 40 square meters, 42 square meters, 19 square meters, and 34 square meters.  What is the volume of earthwork needed along this road?
}}

{{Answer |
Three sections exist between all of these cross sections.  Since none of the sections end with an area of zero, the average end area method can be used.  The volumes can be computed for respective sections and then summed together.

Section between 0 and 50 meters:

&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{{A_1 + A_2}}{{2}}L = \frac{{40 + 42}}{{2}}50 = 2050\ cubic-meters\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Section between 50 and 100 meters:

&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{{A_1 + A_2}}{{2}}L = \frac{{42 + 19}}{{2}}50 = 1525\ cubic-meters\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Section between 100 and 150 meters:

&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{{A_1 + A_2}}{{2}}L = \frac{{19 + 34}}{{2}}50 = 1325\ cubic-meters\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Total Volume is found to be:

&lt;math&gt;2050 + 1525 + 1325 = 4900\ cubic-meters\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
}}

===Example 2: Mass Balance===

{{TProblem |
Given the following cut/fill profile for each meter along a 10-meter strip of road built on very, very hilly terrain, estimate the amount of dirt left over or needed for the project.

* 0 Meters: 3 meters of fill
* 1 Meter: 1 meter of fill
* 2 Meters: 2 meters of cut
* 3 Meters: 5 meters of cut
* 4 Meters: 7 meters of cut
* 5 Meters: 8 meters of cut
* 6 Meters: 2 meters of cut
* 7 Meters: 1 meter of fill
* 8 Meters: 3 meters of fill
* 9 Meters: 6 meters of fill
* 10 Meters: 7 meters of fill
}}

{{Answer |
If 'cut' is considered an excess of available earth and 'fill' is considered a reduction of available earth, the problem becomes one of simple addition and subtraction.

&lt;math&gt;[(-3) + (-1) + 2 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 2 + (-1) + (-3) + (-6) + (-7)] * 1 m^2 = 3\ cubic-meters\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

3 cubic-meters of dirt remain in excess.
}}

==Thought Question==

'''Problem'''

If it is found that the mass balance is indeed balanced (end value of zero), does that automatically mean that no dirt transport, either out of or into the site, is needed?

'''Solution'''

No.  Any soil scientist will eagerly state that dirt type can change with location quite quickly, depending on the region.  So, if half a highway cuts from the earth and the other half needs fill, the dirt pulled from the first half cannot be simply dumped into the second half, even if mathematically it balances.  If the soil types are different, the exact numbers of volume needed may be different, as different soil types have different properties (settling, water storage, etc.).  In the worse case, not consulting a soil scientist could result in your road being washed out!

In JavaScript you can change elements by using the following syntax:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
element.attribute=&quot;new value&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, the &quot;src&quot; attribute of an image is changed so when the script is called, it changes the picture from &quot;myPicture.jpg&quot; to &quot;otherPicture.jpg&quot;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
//The Html
&lt;img id=&quot;example&quot; src=&quot;myPicture.jpg&quot;&gt;
//The JavaScript
document.getElementById(&quot;example&quot;).src=&quot;otherPicture.jpg&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;
In order to change an element, you use its argument name for the value you wish to change.
For example, let's say we have a button, and we wish to change its value.
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; id=&quot;myButton&quot; value=&quot;I'm a button!&quot;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
Later on in the page, with JavaScript, we could do the following to change that button's value:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
myButton = document.getElementById(&quot;myButton&quot;); //searches for and detects the input element from the 'myButton' id
myButton.value = &quot;I'm a changed button&quot;; //changes the value
&lt;/source&gt;
To change the type of input it is (button to text, for example) then use:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
myButton.type = &quot;text&quot;; //changes the input type from 'button' to 'text'.
&lt;/source&gt;
Another way to change or create an attribute is to use a method like &lt;code&gt;element.setAttribute(&quot;attribute&quot;,&quot;value&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;element.createAttribute(&quot;attribute&quot;,&quot;value&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;.
Use &quot;setAttribute()&quot; to change a attribute that has been defined before.
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
//The Html
&lt;div id=&quot;div2&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; //Make a div with an id of div2 (we also could have made it with JavaScript)
//The Javascript
var e = document.getElementById(&quot;div2&quot;); //Get the element
e.setAttribute(&quot;id&quot;,&quot;div3&quot;); //Change id to div3
&lt;/source&gt;
But use &quot;createAttribute()&quot; if you want to set a value that hasn't been defined before.
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
var e = document.createElement('div'); //Make a div element (we also could have made it with Html)
e.createAttribute(&quot;id&quot;,&quot;myDiv&quot;); //Set the id to &quot;myDiv&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:HK ifc Overview.jpg|thumb|right|Two International Finance Centre designed by César Pelli in Hong Kong is the tallest building on the skyline completed in 1998 at the end of the Asian economic crisis. Multiple owners hold a stake and the building is occupied by influential local banks to corporations from across the globe including Ernst &amp; Young and the Blackstone Group. To be fair, there are no naming rights to the building. Hong Kong since before its handover to China in 1997 is a leading example of Westernized values of economic development being exported globally. The territory has even influenced similar development in China's mainland.]]

A multitude of perspectives define and shape economic development as we proceed into the 21th Century. Economic development affects all realms of life, economic, political and philosophical. It is policy in practice and a goal in process, yet there is no end point. This book will help you explore and understand what is meant by this term and how it affects the world and your local environment.

Questions that will be explored include:
* How can economic development best be stimulated? 
* What sort of business regulations are most conducive to quality economic development?
* How can regulations be developed to maximize the benefit for both the people of the state and the businesses and their customers?

It should be clarified, this book is not about the [[Principles of Economics]], nor to explain the mathematical formulas and functions which govern the actions of governments. 
Though numbers will enter into the discussion, economic development is more a theory and philosophy of ''what'' works best and ''what'' is needed, as opposed to, ''how'' does it work and ''how'' should we manage our economies. 
It is suggested of course that a reader should familiarize themselves with the principle measures of the economy and the financing actions of enterprise. 

Lastly, this book does not attempt to provide an entire global examination of economic development as it uniquely occurs in each country, but to generalize and provide a basic view of its process as it occurs and changes in the Western world. As stated, economic development continues to be re-defined and each era marks a different interpretation as technology and circumstances change in the world. Hopefully this text will attempt to weave common elements together and present the situation as it exists today.

==What is economic development?==
'''Definition'''
Economic development has several definitions from local to global perspectives. Professor of Economics and Public Policy Alan Deardorff at the University of Michigan as part of his International Economics Glossary calls it: &quot;Sustained increase in the economic standard of living of a country's population, normally accomplished by increasing its stocks of physical and human capital and improving its technology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/e.html International Economics Glossary ]&lt;/ref&gt; At the local level, the term is brought to a more reachable level. For example the UrbanPlan curriculum states: &quot;Economic development—A term generally applied to the expansion of a community’s property and sales tax base or the expansion of the number of jobs through office, retail, and industrial development.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbanplan.org]&lt;/ref&gt; An interesting Cornell article expands: &quot;Economic development is typically measured in terms of jobs and income, but it also includes improvements in human development, education, health, choice, and environmental sustainability. Business and economic developers in the US are increasingly recognizing the importance of quality of life, which includes, environmental, and recreational amenities, as well as social infrastructure such as child care, in attracting and retaining businesses in a community.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://government.cce.cornell.edu/doc/html/MethodologyGuide_TermsUsed.htm Cornell]&lt;/ref&gt; In each of these definitions, the focus is on growth of the physical and social sphere of life. As well there is an inherent goal, that such growth achieves a greater &quot;standard of living&quot; or &quot;quality of life.&quot; Important to note is that residential development is a separate component. Lastly, the field does presume one common fact, that what ''is'' there is not providing what that community needs. 

'''In government structure'''
Economic development (ED) is seen both as a policy and a profession. In the United States, most local governments have an economic development authority that oversees and guides enterprise in states and cities. Many states have multiple layers of such groups. For example, a neighborhood might have its own non-profit to help small businesses establish storefronts. The municipality's economic development department would help major corporations locate into city limits. Most cities have metropolitan regions, and such regional authorities can promote entire areas of a state for new companies. The state's workforce and employment department would then overlap all of these, tracking job growth and ensuring Federal funds may be available for job programs and assistance. ED many times is an expected part of government function because cities and regions are constantly competing for jobs which no longer need a specific location. 

'''As government policy'''
As policy, ED is frequently noted in the news as a function of a country's government to improve the welfare of its citizens by providing and literally building opportunities. The skyscrapers and dams being fervorently built in China's coastal cities and rural west have become a symbol of ED. The term started for American cities in the advent of suburbia in the 1970s but had not exactly entered American politics until the economic boon of the 1990s. ED has traditionally been applied to major projects such as a new industrial zone or enclosed shopping mall as well as waterworks projects and freeway expansion. However suburbia by the 1990s began to realize that the capitalist micro-economies of downtowns were not going to remake themselves and the term gained full footing to ensure stability in new cities by carefully planning and plotting the location of potential retail, services, and office. ED has also become familiar with medical and hospitality industries, seeing hospital campuses and hotels as valuable as an office tower. The main goal with ED as government policy is that jobs must grow in the end, much like how private companies ultimately wish to gain profits from new investment. 

'''As a profession'''
As a profession, ED Directors and Business Specialists work with business owners and much like courting deals in the private sector, will try to provide opportunities to entrepreneurs. These may include qualifying special new business loans, offering tax breaks on a piece of land, or ensuring planning officials can compromise to approve a project. While ED personnel are generally &quot;on the ground,&quot; they also do extensive research and quantitative analysis as to potential sites which may accommodate future employers. Regularly they perform many urban planning and community development functions such as identifying properly zoned areas for commercial or industrial and the accompanying codes and variances that could suit a business model. With these goals, ED staff may also influence planning decisions and encourage the establishment of Enterprise Tax Zones which specifically encourage businesses to locate in a particular geographic area. 

===The city and the hinterland===
The basis for urban economies is in understanding the relationship of cities and the hinterland.  The hinterland has been used since the 20th century by geographers to describe rural land, the &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;wild&quot; space between cities. Eugene van Cleef would better define it in &quot;Hinterland and Umland,&quot; tracing its Germanic routes as the land extending from the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hinterland and Umland|author=Eugene van Cleef|volume=Geographical Review, Vol. 31, No. 2 (Apr., 1941), pp. 308-311   (article consists of 4 pages)|publisher=Published by: American Geographical Society|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/210211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best equivalent is &quot;back country.&quot; Though with a slight negative connotation, the hinterland has become an appropriate term to describe land areas that do not necessarily have a city or urbanized function but are not necessarily rural lands. For example much of the central to western United States is unincorporated or not in use at all due to natural features.  As well hinterland encompasses all natural lands even those in protected status.   

The need to understand the relationship between the city (meaning both urbanized and metropolitan areas) and the hinterland, is helpful to understanding the cycle of urban economies and flow of investment and assets. 

===Urban economies: cycle flow and assets===

Urban economies seen through input and output, are essentially machines in themselves. Urban means dense or close together and the proximity allows economic activity to blossom. Flour milling was an early American economic industry that was inherently urban. The multiple costs of each component limited millers to draw from local economies.

[[Image:Wal-Mart in Madison Heights.jpg|thumb|right|This Wal-Mart in Madison Heights, Virginia is one of nearly 2000 stores in smaller communities of the United States. By the 1990s, the &quot;big box&quot; store became a regular icon of economic development in rural areas where typical retail found in major cities would not establish. By the turn of the century, Wal-Mart's effects on these communities was marked by the downfall of local retail and criticized labor practices. Corporate expansion into undeveloped areas is an example of incompatibility between city and hinterland.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Is adding other herbs apart from Parsley a good idea? I plan to do it tonight, the first time I make this, but I'm interested to hear your opinions. I'd probably enjoy it regardless, but I'm wondering if, like, other green herbs would be a good addition or if they'd ruin the flavor. I'll report back with a review of it and a list of what I modified. [[Special:Contributions/66.215.20.28|66.215.20.28]] ([[User talk:66.215.20.28|talk]]) 23:10, 21 July 2008 (UTC)
:If anyone's interested: I made it with the standard recipe, but with a turnip, a parsnip, and a bottle of Guinness extra stout. Mutton works incredible for this; even after 2.5 hours of stewing, it's got texture and flavor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The .NET Framework is a common environment for building, deploying, and running Web Services, Web Applications, Windows Services and Windows Applications. The .NET Framework contains common class libraries - like ADO.NET, ASP.NET and Windows Forms - to provide advanced standard services that can be integrated into a variety of computer systems.

== Introduction ==

VB.NET is a language in itself. It can perform mathematical and logical operation, variable assignment and other expected traits of a programming language. This in itself is not flexible enough for more complex applications. At some stage, the developer will want to interact with the host system whether it be reading files or downloading content from the internet. 

The .NET framework is a toolset developed for the Windows platform to allow the developer to interact with the host system or any external entity whether it be another process, or another computer. The &lt;em&gt;.NET&lt;/em&gt; platform is a Windows platform specific implementation. Other operating systems have their own implementations due to the differences in the operating systems I/O management, security models and interfaces.

== Background ==

*.NET was originally called NGWS(Next Generation Windows Services).
*.NET does not run IN any browser.  It is a RUNTIME language (Common Language Runtime) like the Java runtime.  [[w:Microsoft Silverlight|Microsoft Silverlight]] does run in a browser, but has nothing to do with .NET.
*.NET is based on the newest Web standards.


*.NET is built on the following Internet standards

** HTTP, the communication protocol between Internet Applications
** XML, the format for exchanging data between Internet Applications
** SOAP, the standard format for requesting Web Services
** UDDI, the standard to search and discover Web Services

A Microsoft.NET Assembly is an exe or dll. Assemblies are the basic unit of deployment. An assembly consists of 4 components:
# Assembly Metadata (also known as Assembly Manifest)
#*This is sort of like a packaging list of everything that is required for this assembly to work. A manifest contains:
#*#Version requirements
#*#Security Identity
#*#Scope of assembly
# Type Metadata 
# IL (Intermediate Language)
# Resources

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:41, 22 July 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Delta3D''' - A Free Open Source Software (FOSS) Game engine - gaming/simulation engine - API.

Wish I could say this is a &quot;how to&quot; guide. Mostly it's a reference, inverse tree. How, sure, but not necessarirly current or complete. 

Most folks can build and run Delta3D... but that isn't why you're here.

==Disclaimer==
All products' trademarks and copyrights referenced are property of their respective trademark and copyright holders... yadda, yadda, yadda. Read the product licenses.

There are several Delta3D package sources. Ensure you have the right version and configure your environment correctly, otherwise the build(s) and/or execution will fail. The most recent isn't necessarily the best.

Your system hardware and software will affect the use and operation of Delta3D and related applications. Sadly, I can only attest to my experience using Windows OS and MSVC 2005 development environment. Hopefully cross-platform source and development has progressed to the point that this won't be a limiting factor should you be using a different system.

Take a minute to do some research and verify anything you plan to use or install - tools in particular and as always if you create a user account for any site related to source (Delta3D, SourceForge, OSG, etc), manage your accounts and behave well in the community forums and discussions to get the most out of the products. Use Google, Yahoo, Bing, Wikipedia, MSN, whatever search reference/resource you like, or any other file verification facility you think is best to confirm an application/file before installing and using as described here - even ask your friends. There are impostors, leeches, and scams; or different (older/newer) versions that aren't going to work. Better yet, go to the forum and see what the latest news is before getting started.

==Credits==
The &quot;product&quot; (Delta3D) is managed and supported by the &quot;Modeling, Virtual Environments, and Simulation&quot; (MOVES) Institute at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. They hire programmers, you should apply. The &quot;software&quot; is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). The external modules (libraries) have their own licensing. Some modules, such as Qt (kute), require the user (you) to download - install - build - separately for use with Delta3D.

As a cross-platform &quot;application&quot;, primarily written in C++, different operating systems and development environments are supported. That means you can create a simulation or game (MMORPG) using your computer and &quot;make&quot; (IDE); once you have an idea - otherwise it just tests and pre-built applications.

== How long will this take? ==
At a minimum this is a &quot;Two week&quot; project, for anything more than just seeing what Delta3D has to offer as a game development platform. If you install the  Delta3D base package, and it's compatible with your system, you'll be up and running in an hour or so. Otherwise this will take a bit, it may take a few days - for the full package (including external dependencies) download, install, configure, and build. You will have to accept accomplishments in stages. Beyond that, if you delve into development using Delta3D, you can spend years working with it. It's a great hobby.

== What do I need? ==
You will need a number of different tools to download and use the packages that comprise the Delta3D &quot;package&quot;. There may be better applications available than those listed here, use at your discretion.

The following are suggested tools and used for purposes of reference for build and access in this &quot;guide&quot;. You may find alternatives or have a different environment.

MSWindows Vista SP2, MSVC 2005 (documented example).

[http://tortoisesvn.net/ TortoiseSVN], using TortoiseSVN 1.6.14.

[http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html CMake], using CMake 2.8.4.

[http://www.7-zip.org/ 7Zip] if your OS does not support the extraction of all &quot;archive&quot; files provided in the various packages.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Source==
Delta3D consists of many libraries - some outdated. As a game developer, that is why you are here, you will have to deal with several different &quot;systems&quot; and requirements.

You will need a &quot;Source Control&quot; application to access the files for the latest versions of Delta3D and the related libraries/modules. Tortoise SVN is a good one; at least for Windows.

It is continually changing. That means you can only rely on the last version you built to work. Keep track of tags and changes that affect your &quot;game&quot; - Save early, save often.

The &quot;user&quot; (developer) is expected to &quot;leverage&quot; the provided applications and libraries as resources and technical references in order to create their own custom implementation to make &quot;full&quot; use of Delta3D.

&lt;b&gt;Getting started&lt;/b&gt; - You're going to need about 11GB of disk space to download, install, and build all of Delta3D; less than half that if you only want the basics. If you use &quot;zip&quot; or other source double the space needed for extract. It really is best if you just directly download from SVN and build, but, that's up to you.

Create a new folder, name it something like &quot;Delta3D&quot;. 

Document what you do - it will save you time later when you have questions or are just not sure where you were last. Create a text file, something like &quot;Delta3dVer.txt&quot;; so you can keep notes on versions and results.

&lt;b&gt;Delta3D source.&lt;/b&gt; Download will take about 6 minutes using 87MB disk space. The &quot;trunk&quot; is the &quot;latest&quot; development version of Delta3D, it may include incomplete implementations and cause errors during builds. If you want an official release version download the [http://www.delta3d.org/index.php?topic=downloads Delta3D base package].

SVN repository: https://delta3d.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/delta3d/trunk/delta3d.

Using Windows and TortoiseSVN (sorry to all other users), right-click (yep, Windows vernacular) on the folder you created and select &quot;SVN Checkout...&quot;

Set the source path (SVN repository as noted above) and folder (as you created). If you get a warning that the folder isn't empty, that's fine, you may have your text file for notation there; select OK - the operation will only add files. If for some reason you don't get the download right you can always copy/move the folders; as long as the &quot;.svn&quot; folders are present it will track for source control check-out/check-in.

Add a note to your version text doc; Delta3D 07/19/2011 rev 8377.

&lt;b&gt;Delta3D external dependency files.&lt;/b&gt; It will take about 4 minutes to download and needs 57MB disk space, each, you only need one. Which version you need depends on your &quot;Windows version&quot;, at present 2005 or 2008; any other version requires a custom build. Pick one, as appropriate for your system. If you're adventurous, you can download both - set the target directory to something like &quot;extVS2005&quot; and &quot;extVS2008&quot;. You can set the path to whichever you want for each build or rename &quot;ext&quot; as needed so you don't have to change the environment variables when switching versions.

SVN repository: http://delta3d-extras.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/delta3d-extras/ExtDep/dev/Windows/XP/VS2008/ext/

or

SVN repository: http://delta3d-extras.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/delta3d-extras/ExtDep/dev/Windows/XP/VS2005/ext/

From any non-source controlled directory (i.e. not the Delta3D folder you created), right-click and select &quot;SVN Checkout...&quot;. Set a sub-directory in the target folder for easy tracking (i.e. &quot;your Delta3D path&quot;/ext).

Add a note to your source control text doc - Delta3D ext 3/19/2011 rev 3107. The version number is not same as the Delta3D core source; it tracks with dtPhysics and Simulation Core. Even though there will be version changes you may not get updates for any or all directories.

[http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/delta3d/index.php?title=TutorialEnvVar &lt;b&gt;Delta3D Environment&lt;/b&gt;]. Before you proceed any further, make sure you have your path and environment variables setup. Without configuring your environment you will not be able to properly build or execute the applications.

Note:
If you have your environment variables setup, and the package matches your system, you can run applications using the pre-compiled versions provided; no build necessary.

Windows - Tortoise SVN users, right click on folder and select properties to view SVN source. You can verify which version/path the files are based on (i.e. 2005); knowing which version you are using is important when errors occur for missing links during build or failure to execute.

If you need to do a custom build - ouch - you can retrieve the &quot;current&quot; external dependency source file &quot;packages&quot; from: http://delta3d-extras.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/delta3d-extras/ExtDep/dev/src/. About 100MB, and 7 minutes to download. You will have to extract, configure and build for your local system/version. Additional packages will be required for dtPhysics and Simulation Core. It is best if you create a completely separate directory for these files.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Build the &quot;basic&quot; Delta3D package.&lt;/b&gt; Additional external dependencies and options will be required to do a full build with all of the &quot;Delta3D features&quot; available; these are described later.

You don't need to build &quot;everything&quot; see [http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/delta3d/index.php?title=TutorialDelta3DCMake Delta3D CMake] for options.

&lt;b&gt;CMake&lt;/b&gt; - Launch CMake; desktop shortcuts are handy, make one. CMake will create the &quot;solution&quot; files needed to build Delta3D based on the provided support file CMakeLists.txt. It is so much easier than setting your path and dependencies manually. When you get to the point of making your own custom application based on Delta3D you'll want to create a CMakeLists.txt too so updates to Delta3D are easily integrated.

Set the &quot;source&quot; and &quot;build&quot; directories to your Delta3D folder. Use the &quot;browse&quot; options or enter paths manually. You may create a custom build folder (sub-directory or separate location) to track versions if desired. The custom build folder will have to be added to your path environment in order to properly run applications.

Select File&gt;&gt;Delete Cache to reset output - not necessary for first build but good practice to do clean builds later. Clearing the cache will prevent previous settings from causing errors during build. If you have properly set your environment variables there will be little or nothing to change in order to generate a proper configuration.

Click on &quot;Configure&quot; to set the system - &quot;Visual Studio 8 2005&quot; - and generate the initial parameter list.

All items will appear &quot;red&quot; initially. If you got all the preparation steps done correctly the default settings will work without any modification. However, review and set the parameters/options as appropriate for your system - you may need to manually enter values for some options, depending on your environment settings. For absolute certainty, select &quot;Advanced&quot; option to view all settings.

Click on &quot;Configure&quot; to process your settings - there should be no &quot;red&quot; entries remaining, but make sure there are no &quot;NOT FOUND&quot; items - correct/change as needed and select Configure again if modifications made.

Click on &quot;Generate&quot; - if there are no errors you are now ready to build.

&lt;b&gt;MSVC 2005 build&lt;/b&gt;. Open the &quot;solution&quot;, generated by CMake, make a shortcut on your desktop for easy access. Select the build type you want (release, debug) and perform the build. Takes about 5 minutes (each).

==Idea==
First you have to have an idea.

Delta3D is not a finished product ready for release/deployment. Tests, examples, and other support applications are provided. But those only serve to test your system not provide a &quot;game&quot; as you want/expect. Or does it...

Try the test applications. Despite the fact that the &quot;test&quot; applications are outdated or nearly obsolete, they do make good use of functionality. You may find something that is a good base for your design. FireFighter (demo) is a reasonable example for the core product; you're better off using Simulation Core (SimCore) for more advanced, current, and complete development but that requires much more work on your part for installation and compilation/development.

FPS; MMORPG; SimCore (simulation core).

There are plenty of ideas out there, you have one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Delta3D Knowledge Tree'''

Woops.  I thought that tree metaphor was dead!?  Sorry.  

So, there are some core areas of knowledge that, if you don't have any clue about them you're in trouble with Delta3D.

Here's the basic list (upside down tree, root first!):

* C++
* Basic Graphics Concepts
* OpenGL
* Open Scene Graph (OSG)
* Delta3D

'''C++'''

Delta3D is a set of libraries written in C++.  So you'll be writing your core VSG (Vis, Sim, Game!) code in C++ in order to easily call these functions and use these classes.
You can learn C++ as you go, but we strongly encourage looking up on wikipedia or cplusplus.com any concepts you read that you don't understand.  

Here's a little test.  Do you feel comfortable when I speak the following words?

* Method
* Member
* Derived class
* Virtual function
* Protected member
* Interface
* Organism

Forget that last one.  It's a silly reference to a Ren and Stimpy cartoon.
You're going to be sifting through reams of Delta3D and OSG online docs to find the classes and functions you'll need.  These docs use these fancy C++ terms like they're going out of style.  Unless you've got a decent handle on them you're going to be popping handfuls of ibuprofen.

'''Basic Graphics Concepts'''

Know what a sphere is?  How about a plane?  How about a vertex, vertex normal, face, polygon?  
Vector?
Again, look these graphics terms up on wikipedia and follow some of the links.  It's quite fun.
OpenGL is all about this stuff and OpenGL is REALLY near the root of that mythical Knowledge Tree.
It wouldn't hurt to read a bit of OpenGL too but I think that can wait until you start getting deeper into your own VSG development.

'''OpenGL'''

Really, look up OpenGL in Wikipedia and you'll have everything you need.
Let's just add this, as a useful simplification: There are only two low-level graphics libraries in existence, one of which every computer needs to do 3D graphics:  DirectX and OpenGL.
DirectX runs only on Windows.
OpenGL runs on everything else, including Windows.
Delta3D uses OpenGL.

'''Open Scene Graph'''

Delta3D is a set of functions and classes that make building a VSG easier and more worry-free. It's got lots of things that assume you want to build a VSG in a particular way (but not too particular).
However, there exists a data structure called a scene graph that assumes even less about what you are trying to do with your code but still tries to help.  Mostly what the scene graph attempts to do is hide some of the nasty, voluminous OpenGL code that you need to make 3D graphics appear on the screen.
Open Scene Graph is a very successful, long-lived open source scene graph library that you can download and start using today!  Of course, Delta3D beat you to that.  It's already based on top of OSG.
Does Delta3D hide all the nasty OSG workings from you like OSG did for OpenGL?  Not really!  Or, partly, but not as much as you might like.  
This is VERY important:  You're not going to get very far with Delta3D without knowing the how/what/why of OSG workings.   This is sad but true.  You've really got two large libraries, Delta3D AND OSG, to get a handle on before you can work magic with Delta3D.

So might as well take a look at it now: www.openscenegraph.org.
There's not avoiding it.
Of course, this book covers OSG too, but from the perspective of someone trying to get it working with Delta3D.

'''Delta3D'''

Finally we arrive at the glittery leaves of our tree, Delta3D itself.  
Lots of classes and functions to explore.  And it's very well organized so each bit you learn solidly will pay off in helping you understand that which still lies before you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Delta3D, Ground Floor=

'''A Quick Scapegoat'''

Delta3D is a work in progress.  There are several very smart people constantly adding, changing, and improving the library for us.  They are all marines and work at an aquarium apparently.  : )

This means, somewhat unfortunately, that the &quot;ground floor&quot; can shift a bit here and there as new, cool ideas are implemented.

So, I'd like to say &quot;the following is how ALL Delta3D applications work&quot; but that's skipping the fact that there are now various ways to structure a Delta3D app depending on what you're trying to build.

So, the following is one of the most basic ground floors for Delta3D, but not the only one.

'''The Ground Floor'''

In order to have a game you need a game loop. This is some kind of timed, cycling if-then code block that is checking for mouse movement, updating zombies positions, making plasma shots inch slightly closer to the zombies, etc.

Do you program your own loop?  NEVER!  That would so old-school.

Delta3D takes care of this when you create an instance of the Application class.
The Application class has a game loop built into it along with other functions to make useful stuff happen inside the game loop.

So one of the first things you'll see is a variable getting initialized as an Application?  NO!

What?!  Why?!

Because the Application class has virtual functions, which means its got functions that it really, really wants to make real but doesn't know what their internals should look like.  This means you have to provide the internals.  Which means you have to &quot;derive&quot; your own class from the Application class, THEN you can create a new variable to store this game instance.
So chances are, most Delta3D code you've looked at (or will), will have something like this:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class MainApp : public dtABC::Application
&lt;/source&gt;

Here our MainApp is OUR class that's derived from the Application class (that is stored in the dtABC 'namespace')

And then somewhere in the main block something like

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
RefPtr&lt;MainApp&gt; app = new MainApp(&quot;config.xml&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

Which creates a new variable app to store our MainApp object.  Inside app now lives our game loop which can be started with

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
app-&gt;Config();
app-&gt;Run(); 
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;u&gt;'''What is an Acceptable Use Policy?'''&lt;/u&gt;
An Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) (as applied to education) is a written agreement that outlines the terms and conditions for using technology in a school district as well as  personal technology used on the school property during school hours. This document should be signed annually by all active members of a school District including employees, students and parents.  A model AUP is provided by the US Department of Justice at http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/rules/acceptableUsePolicy.htm .

The AUP may include information on

•	the instructional philosophies that will be supported through the incorporation of the Internet and technology within the school environment
•	benefits associated with the incorporation of technology
•	 a code of conduct detailing expectations, consequences and safety with regards to the use of technology
•	Ways in which students can use technology in accordance with the stated regulations
•	roles and responsibilities of technology employees
•	a statement regarding legal compliance.  
•	a place for signatures

&lt;u&gt;'''Instructional philosophy'''&lt;/u&gt;
In this section of the document, the District’s instructional philosophy should be included as well as information regarding how the incorporation of technology addresses this philosophy. A school’s instructional philosophy should be developed independent of the AUP but, within the AUP, the ways in which technology will enhance the instructional philosophy should be discussed.
 
&lt;u&gt;'''Benefits'''&lt;/u&gt;
Benefits associated with the incorporation of technology in a school District should be included in the AUP. Such benefits include anything that is created by or facilitated by the integration of technology including teaching or administrative tasks. These may include (but are not limited to) the perks of e-mail, the necessity of gaining information from the Internet, and the utilization of interactive whiteboards (Smartboards) and other curriculum-enhancing technology. Also included is the access and exchange of information; communications; and the organization, analysis and presentation of information.

&lt;u&gt;'''The code of conduct'''&lt;/u&gt; 

Within this section, there must be a detail of all expectations of technology use, consequences of misuse, and safety related to proper use. Forms of banned software, hardware and technology -based applications including websites must be detailed to insure that users utilize technology in accordance with the stated policy. If, for example, a policy includes the term “the access or transmission of materials using district technology resources which are inappropriate in the school environment is strictly prohibited” there must also be a list of offences which would be included in the definition of ”inappropriate in the school environment”. Without the explicit list, a debatable area may exist in regards to the definition which may defeat the purpose of creating an AUP.
Expectations may include (but are not limited to)

•	Students must respect and protect the privacy of others by not sharing passwords, by not accessing other’s accounts and by keeping private information private.
•	Students must respect and protect the intellectual property of others by not violating copyright laws and by not plagiarizing as well as “stealing” other’s digital property.
•	Students must respect and practice the principles of community by only communicating in an ethical manner, by reporting inappropriate material to an adult and by not utilizing material in an illegal manner or using illegal material.
The above are examples of guidelines that may be present in an AUP. These come from the model AUP posted at the link above provided by the USDOJ.

Also included in this section, should be the need to address Internet filtering (see below), cyberethics and cybersafety (see below) as well as the penalties associated with the misuse of District technology or personal technology during school hours on school property. For each expectation there should be a consequence addressing non-compliance.  Such consequences can range from loss of on campus technology privileges to penalties associated with breaking a Federal or State law. 
Sections on personal and system safety should address the need to ban the sharing of username/passwords, entering chat rooms, posting personal information and accessing inappropriate material such as pornography or violent content. Also, restrictions on accessing information that could harm a system such as spam or viruses with the intent to disrupt the network should be included in the AUP. Other information which addresses the breaches in Internet or Intranet security by members of the school community or by unrelated persons should be explicitly included as well. Also included in this document should be a description of security measures that currently exist as well as a plan to address the needed security with new technology. A description of data and network security is important. Many of these safety regulations could be included as part of the expectations. However, it is important to include security information as well as a verbal or written explanation of the reasons why the security guidelines are in place. 

&lt;u&gt;'''What is Internet filtering?'''&lt;/u&gt;

Internet filtering blocks users from accessing sites that may contain material deemed inappropriate. Twenty-one States have Internet-filtering laws that apply to public schools and libraries. These laws stem from the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) which grants federal funds to public schools which abide by the outlined regulations. Such regulations require the School Board to adopt an Internet use policy (many create an AUP which covers Internet use) that limits and/or bans minors from gaining access to inappropriate materials such as explicit sexual content or other harmful sites.

To accomplish adequate filtering, some states require that the public schools install filtering software to insure that all explicit content is filtered. Filtering software blocks sites based on words, phrases or other criteria. Many users have found that certain words that may not refer to an explicit site resulted in a blocked search because of their sexual or harmful connotations. For example, creating a filter based on the word “breast” will block all sexually explicit content as well as potentially blocking chicken recipes, science-related topics and other content that may be useful for an educational environment. Additionally, some filtered software recognize a combination of letters and therefore may block searches that contain the same letters as an explicit term. Lastly, some filtering software has been known to block non offensive material such as information on certain religions and cultures.

Internet filtering software can also block specific websites such as YouTube. Often, such blocked sites may provide benefits to teachers. Districts may want to analyze the Internet filtering software that they are incorporating to allow different users access to different materials. For example, while YouTube as a lot of inappropriate material for students, it also has a plethora of video lessons and clips which can supplement a teacher’s lesson. Students have grown up in a technological environment which often means that they have learned how to surpass or to override certain barriers associated with the use of technology. Because of their familiarity with Internet filtering, many students are able to get around blocked websites by accessing them through different country codes or by using different search terms. 

When purchasing and implementing Internet filtering software, school districts must research the best software for their particular needs. Taking into consideration terms and sites that may need to be blocked along with material that may not need to be restricted is important when implementing the correct software. Additionally, districts may consider providing a code for teachers or administrators to override certain restricted searches in case there is an exception. Science teachers may have many of the terms for certain units of study, like reproduction, blocked but, given a code, could filter the useful material from the sites that could be harmful. 

&lt;u&gt;'''What are cyberethics and cybersafety?'''&lt;/u&gt;

With the rise of Internet use comes the increase in potential danger. In a world of anonymity, children are faced with the threats of online bullying, predators and a plethora of inappropriate material. Without guidance, children can communicate with unknown users, share personal information and access sites that could provide potential dangerous information.  In 2000, Janet Reno issued a letter to parents regarding the need to educate their children on appropriate Internet behavior as well as the ethics and responsibility associated with using the Internet. A website www.cybercitizenship.org was created to address these issues. Two years later, President George W. Bush announced efforts to promote online safety by encouraging parents to teach their children how to stay safe while online as well as by addressing the growing issue of child pornography. Through his efforts, many child pornography rings were disbanded, and many predators were prosecuted. Also through his initiative, many sites have been created to address the growing need to educate and to guide safe Internet use. Links to such sites can be found at http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/cyberethics.htm 

&lt;u&gt;'''Student uses'''&lt;/u&gt;

The AUP may include a section which details the ways in which students can use technology in accordance with the AUP. These uses may be ones that fall in a grey area of technology use. These may include (but are not limited to)

•	Design and post websites using school technologies and other materials that relate to school curriculum or events. Because websites, like MySpace and Facebook, may be banned, it is important for students to understand that they can create a website as long as it addresses a topic related to school like clubs, projects or community service.
•	Use communication software for school purposes with teacher permission. Instant messaging and other online chat software would not be in compliance with most AUPs. However, under certain circumstances, IM and other chat software may be necessary to fulfill a school purpose. Students must understand that there is a difference between personal and educational uses of such resources and therefore must receive permission to utilize such software on school grounds or during school hours.
•	Install software as long as it is within licensing agreements and with teacher permission. For example, certain movie or music software may have educational uses. iTunes and other digital media software may not be an appropriate installation on school computers unless there is a specific educational purpose. When a student as defined this purpose and received permission to download, he/she will no longer be in violation of stipulations laid out in the AUP.

&lt;u&gt;'''Legal compliance'''&lt;/u&gt;

The AUP must include a statement that proves that the document complies with state and federal telecommunication regulations as well as a statement that details the need to comply with fair-use policies and copyright laws. Copyrighting and plagiarism may be addressed in other places, but the legal ramifications attached to these items should be explicitly stated. There have been many concerns that the AUP infringes on First Amendment Rights but the legal system has supported the need for such policies to ensure the safety of children. 

&lt;u&gt;'''Roles and responsibilities'''&lt;/u&gt;

This document may outline the roles and responsibilities of all members of the school community including District personal, parents, students and teachers. Within this section, the document should address the ongoing professional development for all members of the community. At the end of the document, there should be information on the process by which the District will reevaluate and modify the AUP. Additionally, a statement regarding supervision and monitoring on a administrative level. Many schools reserve the right to monitor Internet and technology use including e-mail and websites. A statement such as “Administrators reserve the right to examine, use, and disclose any data found on the school's information networks in order to further the health, safety, discipline, or security of any student or other person, or to protect property. They may also use this information in disciplinary actions, and will furnish evidence of crime to law enforcement”( taken from the USDOJ site linked above) to insure that all school users understand that information sent or received over a school district’s system is the property of the school district. This, again, may seem like a violation of privacy, but district’s technically own their computer systems and therefore all users are simply that, users of someone else’s system. 

&lt;u&gt;'''Signatures'''&lt;/u&gt;

At the bottom of the document should be a place for the signatures of the students, teachers and parents to insure that the document has been read and reviewed by all. By signing the document, all users are agreeing to the terms and conditions stated in the AUP. He/she understands that the district may own all material on its computer system and each user must use all technology in compliance with the signed AUP. Without a signed AUP, a member of the school community may not be able to access school technology. 


'''&lt;u&gt;Why do schools need AUPs and how are they developed?'''&lt;/u&gt;

In order to keep the school environment safe, an Acceptable Use Policy is necessary to insure that only appropriate information is accessible to students. Additionally, an AUP is necessary to regulate and to standardize the appropriate uses of all technologies present on school grounds. With the development of new technologies, the guidelines present in the AUP should be continuously updated. A committee of users including teachers, students, parents and administrators should be included in developing and maintaining the district’s AUP. The AUP may be written based on guidelines set forth my State mandates or national recommendations and may need certain criteria for the district to qualify for State or Federal funding. Because different states have different requirements, committees should investigate such requirements before beginning the writing process to insure that the AUP is complete and accurate. There is a vast amount of information that can be included in the AUP. Therefore, the committee members must include regulations, expectations and consequences that they feel relate to their district. In a sense, the AUP must be personalized to each school district based on the technology, uses and community members of each district. Committee members and their responsibilities as well as the AUP updating process should be included under the roles and responsibilities section of the AUP.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}
You have, in all likelihood, previously made acquaintance
with sines and cosines. Sinusoids (which include sines and cosines)
are periodic functions. Periodic functions have the
following property:

    &lt;math&gt; f\,(x) = f\,(x + p) = f\,(x + 2p) = ... &lt;/math&gt;
    
for all ''x'' and certain values of ''p''.
The smallest value of ''p'' for which the above equation
holds is known as the ''period'' of the function.

If you not familiar with sines and cosine functions,
this is what a sine wave looks like:

[[Image:ch15-figure01.png|center]]

Note that for sine waves without phase and frequency shifts (as
above), when ''x'' is zero, the amplitude (y-value) of
the sine wave is zero (with a rising slope).
The wave reaches zero again 
(with a rising slope) ''x'' = 2&lt;big&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/big&gt;.
Contrast this with the cosine wave:

[[Image:ch15-figure02.png|center]]

Unlike the sine wave, which has zero-crossings at multiples of &lt;big&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/big&gt;,
the cosine wave has peaks and troughs at multiples of &lt;big&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/big&gt;.
As with the sine wave, the ''period'', or peak to peak length,
is 2&lt;big&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/big&gt;.

== The general sine wave ==

If you look closely at the two waves, you'll see that the cosine
is just the sine wave shifted &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; units to
the left. So, we can define cosine in terms of sine:

    &lt;math&gt; \cos(x) = \sin(x + \frac{\pi}{2}) &lt;/math&gt;

Note that mathematicians often abbreviate sine to ''sin'' and cosine
to ''cos''.
The above illustrates one of the common ways to modify a sine wave:
shifting the ''phase'' of the wave,
for which the symbol &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;
is often used:

    &lt;math&gt; y = \sin(x + \theta); &lt;/math&gt;

Another modification is to change the amplitude of a sine wave or,
on other words,
to change how high and how low the peaks range. The variable
''a'' is used to indicate amplitude, so the formula for a sine wave
that allows amplitude modification is:

    &lt;math&gt; y = a \sin(x + \theta); &lt;/math&gt;

Finally, it is common to change the frequency of sine waves,
or how many peaks (or troughs) are in a given region. The
variable &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is often used for this task:

    &lt;math&gt; y = a \sin(\omega x + \theta); &lt;/math&gt;

If we set &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; to 2, we will get twice as
many peaks (or troughs) within a given region. The inverse
of frequency is period, so setting &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; to 2
will shorten the peak to peak distance by half. In the particular
case of frequency 2, the period of the sine wave would be
&lt;big&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/big&gt;.

Here's a neat trick.
If you want to find the location of the 'first' zero crossing,
of a general sign wave of this form,
change the sign of both the phase shift and the operator
combining it with ''x'' and then factor out &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;.
For cosine, with
unit amplitude and frequency doubled, we have:

    &lt;math&gt; \cos(x) = \sin(2x + \frac{\pi}{2}) &lt;/math&gt;
     
    &lt;math&gt; \cos(x) = \sin(2x - (-\frac{\pi}{2})) &lt;/math&gt;
     
    &lt;math&gt; \cos(x) = \sin(2[x - (-\frac{\frac{\pi}{2}}{2})]) &lt;/math&gt;
     
    &lt;math&gt; \cos(x) = \sin(2[x - (-\frac{\pi}{4})]) &lt;/math&gt;

This version of cosine has its first zero crossing at
&lt;math&gt;x = -\frac{\pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;ref&gt;
Contrast this with the
cosine wave with unit amplitude and frequency
(shown at the beginning of this chapter),
which has
a zero crossing at &lt;math&gt;x = -\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, to find the
first zero crossing, divide the phase shift by the frequency
and negate it (assuming that the phase shift is being added in).

== Implementing the general sine wave ==

Sway has the functions ''sin'' and ''cos'' built-in, but these functions
assume amplitude = 1, frequency = 1, and phase shift = 0.
&lt;ref&gt;
There is also a generalized cosine function:
&lt;math&gt;y = a \cos(\omega x + \theta)&lt;/math&gt;.
Of course, this is equal to
&lt;math&gt;a \sin(\omega x + \frac{\pi}{2} + \theta)&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/ref&gt;
To implement ''sine'' and ''cosine'', we will take our
usual object approach:

    function sine(amp,freq,shift)
        {
        function value(x)
            {
            amp * sin(freq * x + shift);
            }
        this;
        }
     
    function cosine(amp,freq,shift)
        {
        sine(amp,freq,shift + (pi() / 2));
        }

Note how we make cosine a wrapper for sine as cosine is just
sine with a phase shift.

Let's take that little trick we learned in the previous section
for finding the 'first' zero crossing and implement it:

    function sine(amp,freq,shift)
        {
        function value(x) { ... }
        function firstZero()
            {
            // phase shift is added in so just divide and negate
            -(real(shift) / freq);
            }
        this;
        }

Let's see if it works for cosine with frequency 2:

    var w = cose(1,2,0);
     
    sway&gt; -(pi() / 4);
    REAL_NUMBER: -0.7853981634
    
    sway&gt; w . firstZero();
    REAL_NUMBER: -0.7853981634

Good. Let's also check that the value of the sine wave is indeed zero
at that point:

    sway&gt; var fz = w . firstZero();

== Differentiating sine and cosine ==

As SPT points out in Chapter XV in CMT, the derivative
of sine is cosine and the derivative of cosine is the
negative of sine.

Using the first rule, we can add a ''diff'' function
to the ''sine'' constructor. Of course, in keeping
with our unassuming differentiation system, we need
to pass in independent and with-respect-to variables,
as appropriate:
    
    function sine(amp,freq,shift)
        {
        function value(x) { ... }
        function firstZero() { ... }
        function diff()
            {
            cosine(amp,freq,shift);
            }
        this;
        }

Of course, this implementation assumes that the independent
variable and the with-respect-to variable are one and the same.
It also assumes that the independent variable is just a symbol.
As such, we could not construct a sine wave of the form;

    &lt;math&gt; y = 3 \sin(2 x^2 + pi) &lt;/math&gt;

To do so, we will have to take the same approach as for terms,
by allowing the independent variable to be a differentiable
object. Recall the term constructor:

    function term(a,iv,n)
        {
        function value(x) { ... }
        function toString() { ... }
        function diff(wrtv)
            {
            if (n == 0)
                {
                constant(0);
                }
            else
                {
                term(a * n,iv,n - 1) times iv . diff(wrtv);
                }
            }
        
        if (iv is :SYMBOL) { iv = variable(iv); }
        this;
        }

Recall also how the ''diff'' function implements the chain rule.
We will need to follow the same strategy for our ''sine'' constructor:

    function sine(amp,freq,iv,shift)
        {
        function value(x) { ... }
        function firstZero() { ... }
        function diff(wrtv)
            {
            cosine(amp,freq,iv,shift) times iv . diff(wrtv);
            }
         
        if (iv is :SYMBOL,iv = variable(iv));
        this;
        }

All that's left for us to do is implement our visualization for
''sine'' (and, of course, test):

    function toString()
        {
        &quot;&quot; + amp +
            &quot; sin(&quot; + freq +
                &quot;(&quot; + iv . toString() + &quot;)&quot;
                + shift + &quot;)&quot;;
        }

== What is -sin? ==

According to CMT, the derivative of sine is cosine and the derivative
of cosine is -sin. Therefore, the second derivative of sine is -sine.

==Questions==

'''1.'''
What is the difference between the function &lt;math&gt;\sin(x + \frac{\pi}{2})&lt;/math&gt; and the function &lt;math&gt;\sin(x) + \frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;?

'''2.'''
Why can't we name ''sine'' and ''cosine'' constructors ''sin'' and ''cos''?

'''3.'''
Add the following simplification to the ''sine'' constructor. If the phase shift is equal to or greater than 2 &lt;big&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/big&gt;, subract off 2 &lt;big&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/big&gt;.

'''4.'''
Explain why the previous simplification is mathematically valid.

'''5.'''
Simplify the construction of sine objects so that a zero object is generated if the amplitude is zero.

'''6.'''
Simplify the construction of sine objects so that a constant term object is generated if the frequency is zero.

'''7.'''
Simplify the visualization of sine objects so that the amplitude, frequency, and phase shift are omitted if they are 1, 1, and 0, respectively.

'''8.'''
Find and add other visualization mods. Hint: what should your visualization look like if the frequency is != 1 but the independent variable is a term with a coefficient != 1?

== Writing systems of Punjabi ==
We have noted elsewhere that Punjabi is spoken in Punjab, India as well as Punjab, Pakistan. 
Different writing systems are in vogue on either side of the international border. 
While Gurmukhi script is used in India [[Punjabi/Shahmukhi|Shahmukhi]] 
script is used in Pakistan. 
In this book, as of now, we are concerned with Punjabi as written in Gurmukhi script.

== Gurmukhi script ==
Gurmukhi is also called ‘Penti’ which literally means thirty five or consisting of thirty five. 
The original script, as the name suggests, consisted of thirty five letters, 
the present script though contains 41 letters. 
The additional six letters have been added as the neo-group as a result of 
Persian and other foreign language influences. 
The letters are arranged in rows according to the [[Punjabi/Phonetics|place of articulation]] of sound. 
Letters of succesive rows, leaving aside the first and the last of the original Penti, 
are articulated at starting with the velum in the back of the mouth and 
moving out with each succesive row and ending up at the lips.

Gurmukhi has special symbols called [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi/Vowels|matras]] to denote vowels. 
First three letters of Gurmukhi are used to carry the matras when a consonant is not present. 
The remaining 38 letters are consonants and are introduced in the chapters 1 and 4 to 10. 
Gurmukhi also has three diacritics, three sub joined letters and its own set of numerals through 0 to 9 besides the punctuation marks. 
Lesson 11 will be devoted to [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi/Conjuncts|conjuncts]] in Gurmukhi. 
The international numerals are popularly used in Punjabi instead of the 
Gurmukhi numerals and the punctuation marks are also the same as used in English, except for full stop, a bar representing it instead of the dot.
For that reason we will not touch them here.

== Phonetic script ==
Unlike the Roman script Gurmukhi is a phonetic script. Each spoken 
sound is represented by a letter or matra and each letter or matra represents a unique sound. 
We will take advantage of this feature and after we are done with introducing Gurmukhi script module, 
use of Roman letters to show pronunciation will no more be required and will be dispenced with. 
''It is, therefore, important that you should thoroughly learn and practise the use of the script before you move on to other modules of the book.''

 The author is indebted to [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] ([[User talk:Junesun|talk]]) for her very constructive suggestions which&lt;br&gt;resulted in complete recasting of this module making it much simpler to follow by a non-&lt;br&gt;native learner of Punjabi.

[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]]'''Solution:'''&lt;br&gt;
'''A.) What is the curve length?'''

The curves are equal tangent, so we know that: PVI - PVC = PVT - PVI = L/2

From this, we know:
* PVC of First Curve: 48+24
* PVI of Both Curves (this is a constant): (48+24.00 + (450/2) = 50+49)
* &lt;math&gt;x_{rr}&lt;/math&gt;: Distance between PVI and railroad tracks: (51+50 - 50+49 = 101 feet)
* PVI Elevation: 1591 + (0.04*225) = 1600 feet

Use the offset formula for the first curve to find the vertical distance between the tangent and the curve:

&lt;math&gt;Y = \frac{{Ax^2}}{{200L}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;A\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = 7 (Change in Grade)
* &lt;math&gt;L\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = 450 feet
* &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = 51+50 - 48+24 = 326 feet

The offset, Y, at the railroad tracks's station is computed to be 8.27 feet.

The road is to be lowered an additional 20 feet.  Therefore, the new offset at that sight would become 28.27 feet.  The equation for the second curve becomes:

&lt;math&gt;Y = 28.27 = \frac{{7x^2}}{{200L}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Neither L (length of curve) or x (distance of offset from PVC) are known.  However, we know this is an equal tangent curve, meaning the distance from PVC to PVI is L/2 for the curve in question.  Also, the distance between PVI and the railroad tracks is &lt;math&gt;x_{rr}&lt;/math&gt;, which is 101 feet.  Therefore, (L/2) + &lt;math&gt;x_{rr}&lt;/math&gt; equals the distance from PVC to the railroad tracks, which is what we want for x.  Thus, we are left with one unknown and one equation.

&lt;math&gt;Y = 28.27 = \frac{{7(L + 101)^2}}{{200L}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The new curve length is found to be 2812 feet.

'''B.) How deep is the cut at the PVI?'''

To find this, the offset formula can be used again, using the length L/2 as the distance from the PVC on any curve.

For the old curve, the offset is:

&lt;math&gt;Y = \frac{{A(L/2)^2}}{{200L}} = \frac{{7(450/2)^2}}{{200(450)}} = 3.935\ feet\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For the new curve, using data found from before, the offset is:

&lt;math&gt;Y = \frac{{A(L/2)^2}}{{200L}} = \frac{{7(2812/2)^2}}{{200(2812)}} = 24.605\ feet\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The difference between the two offsets is 20.67 feet.  This is the depth of the cut at the PVI.
&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the real world, various factors contribute to non-idealities within inductors.

===Nonzero Resistance===

Nearly all common components have wire leads.  Inductors specifically have this drawback in addition to the fact that they are typically made from a length of wire which is coiled around some form of material.  This wire typically does not have zero resistance.  While small lengths of wire made of typical conductive materials, such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper copper], larger coils will have a relatively large amount of this wire, leading to an added resistance which may not be neglected.  This also becomes true when the potential applied across the inductor increases.

To account for this added resistivity, a non-ideal inductor may be modeled as an ideal inductor in series with a resistor.  This resistance may be measured under DC steady-state conditions.

===High-frequency considerations===

Although quite small, lead wires do have some amount of self-inductance.  This will usually be neglectable except in the case of very small values for inductive components as well as for high frequency design.  To account for the inductance added by these wires, one may model such a non-ideal inductor by including series inductors on for each of the two (or more) leading wires coming from the component.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The second to the last bullet item says, &quot;Some people may feel uncomfortable being seen by their parents during sex = wear a t-shirt or nightgown during sex. Wear a pair of pants with the crotch cut out.&quot;
I am assuming this is a typo.  The article is about colostomy patients, not about being seen by their parents during sex. Perhaps the author meant partner rather than parents?  The author might want to correct this.</text>

A given curve was very poorly designed.  The two-lane road used has a lower-than-average coefficient of friction (0.05), no superelevation to speak of, and 4-meter lanes.  900 kg vehicles tend to go around this curve and are stylistically top heavy.  County engineers have warned that this curve cannot be traversed as safely as other curves in the area, but politicians want to keep the speed up to boost tourism in the area.  The curves have a radius of 500 meters and a design speed of 80 km/hr.  Because the vehicles using the curve are top heavy, they have a tendency to roll over if too much side force is exerted on them (the local kids often race around the curve at night to get the thrill of &quot;two-wheeling&quot;).  As an engineer, you need to prove that this curve is infeasible before an accident occurs.  How can you show this?
}}

{{Answer |
The stated speed is 80 km/hr.  The easiest way would be to prove that this is too high.  We will look at the innermost lane, since forces will be greater there.  Using the general curve radius formula and solving for v, we find:

&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{{v^2 }}{{g\left( {e + f_s } \right)}} = \frac{{v^2 }}{{9.8\left( {0.05 + 0 } \right)}} = 500 - (4/2)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v = 15.62\ m/s = 56.23\ km/hr \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

80 km/hr is much greater than 56.23 km/hr, which by default means that more force is being exerted on the vehicle than the road can counter.  Thus, the curve's speed limit is dangerous and needs to be changed.

[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]]'''Solution:'''&lt;br&gt;
The winner is obvious the Tour-de-France champion, as everything between the two is equal with the exception of power.  Since the champion produces more power, he, by default, would win.

We need to find the maximum steady state speed for each racer to compute the differences in arrival time.  At the steady state speed we must have:

&lt;math&gt;  F_t  = R_a  + R_{rl}  + R_g  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*  &lt;math&gt;F_t\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Tractive Effort
*  &lt;math&gt;m\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Vehicle Mass
*  &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Acceleration
*  &lt;math&gt;R_a\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Aerodynamic Resistance
*  &lt;math&gt;R_{rl}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Rolling Resistance
*  &lt;math&gt;R_g\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = Grade Resistance

We also know:
*  &lt;math&gt;\rho\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = 1.0567 kg/cubic-m
*  &lt;math&gt;W\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = 756 N
*  &lt;math&gt;f_{rl}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = 0.01
*  &lt;math&gt;G\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = 0.06
*  &lt;math&gt;A\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = 0.4 &lt;math&gt;m^2&lt;/math&gt;
*  &lt;math&gt;C_D\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = 0.9

To estimate available tractive effort we can use the definition of power as time rate of work, P = FV, to get:

&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{{P}}{{v}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting in the components of the individual formulas to the general one, we get:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{{P}}{{v}} = \frac{\rho }{2}AC_D V ^2 + f_{rl}W + WG\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

If we compute rolling and grade resistance, we get:

&lt;math&gt;R_{rl} = f_{rl}W = 0.01(756) = 7.56\ N\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;R_g = WG = 756(0.06) = 45.36\ N\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Together, they add up to 52.92 N.

Aerodynamic Resistance can be found to be:

&lt;math&gt;R_a = \frac{1.0567}{2}(0.4)(0.9)v ^2 = 0.19v ^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

With everything substituted into the general formula, the end result is the following formulation:

&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{{P}}{{[0.19v^2 + 52.92]}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This problem can be solved iteratively (setting a default value for v and then computing through iterations) or graphically.  Either way, when plugging in 510 watts for the Tour-de-France champion, the resulting velocity is 7.88 meters/second.  Similarly, when plugging in 310 watts for the HYHM, the resulting velocity is 5.32 meters/second.

The hill is five miles in length, which translates to 8.123 kilometers, 8,123 meters.  It will take the champion 1030 seconds (or 17.1 minutes) to complete this link, whereas the HYHM will take 1527 seconds (or 25.4 minutes).  The resulting difference is 8.3 minutes.
&lt;/div&gt;

Often users ask why nothing happens at the end of the quiz or occasionally report that the quiz &quot;gets stuck on &quot;Finished&quot; - with a loading bar in an endless loop going from 0 to 100&quot;

That loading bar is actually just an animation - to get rid of it and to save any confusion on the part of your quiz takers, it is best and tidiest to redirect the quiz takers to another web page after the quiz is completed.  You can do this using the [[../../Quiz Options/Web Settings|After Quiz]] setting.  You can tell people that this will happen using the '''Finished Quiz Screen Text''' in [[../../Quiz Options/Other Labels|Other Labels]].

&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt;

If you have the Professional version of Question Writer and have used branching you can set the quiz up so that users are sent to different webpages at the end of the quiz depending on their score.  See [[Question_Writer_Manual/About_Questions/Skipping_and_Branching|Skipping and Branching]] for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{prognav|JavaScript|Introduction to the Document Object Model (DOM)|Adding Elements}}

The most common method of detecting page elements in the DOM is by the '''document.getElementById(id)''' method.

==Simple Use==
Let's say, on a page, we have:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;myDiv&quot;&gt;content&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
A simple way of finding this element in Javascript would be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var myDiv = document.getElementById(&quot;myDiv&quot;); // Would find the DIV element by its ID, which in this case is 'myDiv'.
&lt;/source&gt;

== Use of getElementsByTagName ==
Another way to find elements on a web page is by the '''getElementsByTagName(name)''' method. It returns an array of all ''name'' elements in the node.

Let's say, on a page, we have:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;myDiv&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paragraph 1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paragraph 2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;An HTML header&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paragraph 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
Using the getElementsByTagName method we can get an array of all &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; elements inside the div:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var myDiv = document.getElementById(&quot;myDiv&quot;); // get the div
var myParagraphs = myDiv.getElementsByTagName('P'); //get all paragraphs inside the div

// for example you can get the second paragraph (array indexing starts from 0)
var mySecondPar = myParagraphs[1]
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">
&lt;big&gt;
== '''Effectively Using Volunteers''' ==


&lt;big&gt;'''Why Volunteers?'''&lt;/big&gt;

----

Volunteers are anyone who is helping you that isn’t being paid.  They can include students, teachers, parents, administrators and community members.  Volunteers may exist informally (i.e. a student who gives up recess), or formally in the shape of a not-for-profit organization (i.e. the MOUSE project).  Volunteer programs can be either an indispensible asset or an uncompromising consumer of your time.  The key is to maintain control, adapt to the situation, and, as in all other aspects of teaching, plan ahead.  



&lt;big&gt;'''Advantages to Organizing Volunteers'''&lt;/big&gt;

----

There are many advantages to hiring volunteers, and most of them are obvious.  For technology coordinators time is a precious commodity.  Volunteers can be trained to complete jobs that require little training, yet command an inordinate amount of time.
  
For example, you have just ordered a whole lab license for of your favorite webpage designing software.  It could take a whole day of work to load the program into thirty desktops (presuming you can’t push the application out from a central server).  Or, you could train one intelligent child to load the software, enter the serial number, and register the copy online.  In fact, you could train one child; then, he/she could train three friends at lunch.  Surprisingly, the task that took you a whole day to complete can be handled by five school children in less than an hour
	
Often the solution to your colleague’s technical problem is mindlessly simple, and, children relish the opportunity to play teacher to adults.  Therefore, teaching a responsible child to troubleshoot saves you time, and it builds the child’s self esteem in addition to her/his technical skills.  Furthermore, by cultivating students’ problem solving skills, troubleshooting helps students become better analytical thinkers.  


&lt;big&gt;'''Select and Train Volunteers'''&lt;/big&gt;--

----

Although starting a volunteer program may seem like the panacea to many of your problems, there are some subtle nuances to starting a program.  First, you have to select potential candidates.  These students must be somewhat self-governing.  Despite the degree of intelligence, a child you can not trust to walk the halls alone is not a good candidate.  Remember—most of the tasks the volunteer will be doing are simple.  So, a moderately good student who is extremely trustworthy is a better volunteer than a genius with a record.  
	
Next, you will have to find the time to train these children.  Human nature dictates that we appreciate more things that we must sacrifice to attain.  Hence, children who are willing to sacrifice their recess time or are willing to come to school early will appreciate their position more.  Additionally, you know those are children who really want the job.  Let’s face it…if you’re the technology coordinator, your are probably at school working before the day starts anyway.  If you invest that time to train several students, your investment can pay you back exponentially.
	
Training your volunteer staff can be as simple or as complicated as the tasks you want the volunteer to be able to complete.  Never assume a child just knows how to do something.  Actually, make them prove to you by demonstrating.  If you simply ask, the child will tell you “yes” because he/she feels embarrassed.  Most likely, the students that volunteer for service in the computer lab will be bright; therefore, they will be uncomfortable not knowing answers when confronted by a teacher.  If they are not trained properly, inevitably, they will end up costing you time instead of saving you time.

When in doubt remember-- there is an old Slovenian saying that translates to, “the lazy man works twice.” Always thoroughly train your volunteers before assigning them tasks.  Or, you’ll end up spending twice as much time cleaning up the mess or putting out the fire they accidently created.

Finally, you must carefully consider scheduling.  Make sure your volunteers’ schedule doesn’t conflict with their important academic subjects.  If your volunteer fails a math test because she/he missed a class while fixing a teacher’s I-tunes, you may find yourself confronted by a host of angry parents, teachers, and administrators.  Explain to your volunteers that they can’t miss key subjects to volunteer, and randomly spot check to ensure they are telling the truth.

It is a good idea to stick to your schedule.  Don’t allow students to “no show” without an explanation or a good reason.  Truly, consider the time you use to train your volunteers as an investment.  If they aren’t there when you need them, you’ve wasted your investment in time.

  

&lt;big&gt;'''Disadvantages of Volunteer Tech Assistance'''&lt;/big&gt;

----

Volunteers are supposed to make your job easier.  If the volunteer program you are utilizing is costing you unnecessary time and (or) creating more work than tit resolves, consider disbanding the program.  Frequently, volunteer programs can result in the technology coordinator being responsible for supervising more children.  Of course, some children will attempt to abuse their privileges.  If your trusted student is running amuck through the halls while he/she is supposed to be working, don’t take it personally.  Inevitably, children try to test boundaries.  Take swift disciplinary action to resolve the issue expediently.

Unfortunately, children are not the only culprits.  Some teachers will attempt to abuse your good intentioned attempt at efficiency by sending their worst behaved students to volunteer in the computer lab.  Notwithstanding, volunteerism can be an excellent means to remediate the behavior of a wayward child.  Additionally, teachers may attempt to abuse the program by sending flocks of children when they are insufficiently prepared to teach.  The technology coordinator must ALWAYS control who participates in the program.  Programs where there is a clearly defined set of guidelines, and open lines of communication among teachers succeed most frequently.  

A token economy or a hierarchy of responsibility can be a great way of applying ensuring the degree of seriousness with which your student volunteers approach their responsibilities.  For example, in a hierarch of responsibility a computer lab black belt might have permission to assemble new systems, and a white belt may only be aloud to calibrate SMART boards.  In regards to a toke economy, students earn tokens for each day of responsible action.  Earning one token would allow the student to shelve laptops, earning five permits him/her to install new software.  Forcing students to earn their responsibilities will, in effect, ensure you have best workers doing the more complicated work.  Furthermore, from the student’s perspective, applies a degree of cognitive dissonance; thus, they will appreciate their jobs more.

      <text xml:space="preserve">By &quot; Dartanian Dawson&quot;

== Computer Operating Systems ==



&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;== &lt;u&gt;Let Start With The Basic 3 OS Everybody Knows&lt;/u&gt; ==&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;An operating system&lt;u/&gt;&lt;big/&gt;&lt;sub/&gt; is the core element of a computer system.  It is the most important  software that runs on a computer.  It creates an interface so that users are able to interact with the computer hardware.  Simply put, you need an operating system, otherwise, your computer is deemed useless 

                                                                                     -Jennifer Williams-Onyeulo &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;Diagram &lt;h4&gt;


[[File:Operating system placement.svg|thumb|299 px|Diagram of OS]]
&lt;p&gt;
The three main operating systems for personal computers are Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.  Microsoft remains the most popular of the operating system.  Mac OS X was developed by Apple for their Macintosh computers.  Linux started out as a college student hobby and has grown into a very comprehensive and growing operating system.  It became popular because it is both free and open source software.
&lt;p&gt;
All of these operating systems have pros and cons. However, they are all similar and buying the right one is all about personal preference.

==Choosing an Operating System==

When you decide to buy a new computer system or upgrade your existing operating system you have to ensure that you make the right choice.  This is the most important component of your computer that runs all the other programs you have on your computer.  Therefore you should make certain that it will be compatible with the software that you want to use.
&lt;p&gt;
You should think to yourself, &quot;What will I need from my operating system?  Do I need it to run video and image editing applications, or do I need it to run word processing applications? Is it secure enough to withstand hackers? How does the cost compare with other operating systems? Another thing to consider is how will it be maintained and whether software is available.

Making the Break from Windows to Linux
http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000575.htm

==Advantages and Disadvantages of the Major Operating Systems==

No operating system is perfect, each has its advantages and disadvantages. Let's look at each operating system and identify some of its advantages and disadvantages.
 

Mac OS X is great for keeping out hackers and for graphic design and video editing.  However, some software is still not available for Macs.  If the software is for Video and Image editing then clearly Mac would be the choice.  

&lt;p&gt;
Windows score lower points than the others in terms of security, it is very good for compatibility.  There are lots of software and hardware on the market that is compatible with windows. Windows also comes with applications already installed.  On the other hand, it is weak against viruses and can get bogged down easily. 
&lt;p&gt;
Linux, can be obtained for free and it is completely customizable. However, one major drawback is the extreme scarcity of applications for it. Microsoft and other software developers are often very reluctant to release their products for Linux. 

Each operating system will have its advantages over the competition so you need to do thorough research in order to get the best, based on your needs. If you never use a Mac before, visit an apple store and play with it or go to their website http://www.apple.com/mac/
&lt;p&gt;
If you never use Windows, go to a computer store and play with it or go to their website to learn more about it.  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/
&lt;p&gt;

For Linux you can download a live CD distribution for Linux and burn a version of Linux, install it and play with it. Otherwise go online to learn about it http://www.linux.org/  
&lt;p&gt;
Last but not least, check with other Technical Coordinators in your district.  Visit a school and see what operating system they are using and note what problems they are having, if any.

== Securing Your Operating System==

No matter what applications you are running on your operating system, It should be secured to avoid any conflict or leak of data. 

&lt;p&gt;
Here are some guidelines for securing Your operating system
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Windows&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Keep your system and software up to date:&lt;/u&gt;
This is one of the easiest, most effective things you can do to keep your computer secure. You can either update manually with Windows Update, or configure your systems to download updates automatically from Windows website
&lt;br&gt;
http://update.microsoft.com/windowsupdate
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Install antivirus software:&lt;/u&gt;
The vast majority of viruses are designed to affect Windows systems. Get site-licensed antivirus software that is configured to automatically update itself and protect your system. 

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Install anti-spyware software:&lt;/u&gt;
Many of the nuisance-level problems affecting Windows computers are caused by spyware rather than viruses. Spyware can cause effects ranging from a noticeable slowing of your computer to pop-ups and hijacked web browsers; spyware can also be malicious, reporting personal information from credit cards to passwords to other unauthorized websites.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Install Service Pack&lt;/u&gt; 
Install appropriate Service Pack for your operating system. This offers several security enhancements and tools such as firewall and a security configuration wizard to check the system's security.

&lt;p&gt;

Use Manage your Server for server operating systems to enable only the services you need.  This tool is found in the server administration area of your system.

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Choose a good password&lt;/u&gt; 
Any computer that will have multiple useers or attached to a network needs to have good password protection for each user.  Make sure that all user accounts on your network has a password.  A blank password will allow anyone to login to the network simply by clicking.
&lt;p&gt;
Use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to detect and correct common security misconfigurations.  Microsoft provides a tool called the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to assist with detecting potential security flaws and correcting them. The MBSA tool checks for issues such as missing patches, user accounts without passwords, available updates to installed Microsoft software, and more. 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Don't give out too many &quot;administrator&quot; group memberships:&lt;/u&gt;
The Administrator account is the most powerful account on a Windows system. Most users shouldn't log in with administrator privileges for everyday work; the administrator privileges should be reserved for actions such as installing software and patching the system. 

&lt;p&gt;
If only the administrator and guest accounts have been created on the computer, you should create an individual user name so that you can have a regular account for daily use without administrator privileges.
&lt;p&gt;
However, make sure that the administrator account does still have administrator privileges; it's important that at least one user has that ability at all times. 
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Disable unnecessary services and accounts:&lt;/u&gt;
Because each service and account represents a potential entry point to your computer, disabling the features you don't use will greatly diminish your exposure to security risks. Remember, you can always enable a service later if you decide you really do need it. You can enable and disable services with the Manage Your Server tool.  

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Securing Your Mac OS System&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Keep your system and software up to date:&lt;/u&gt;
This is one of the easiest, most effective things you can do to keep your computer secure. The automatic update tool can be found in System Preferences under the apple menu in the top left corner of your screen. Click Software Update, and then choose whether you want to update manually or automatically.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Install antivirus software:&lt;/u&gt;
While Mac OS is not as susceptible to viruses as some other operating systems, you should still install antivirus software to help alert you to viruses in email messages or downloads. Even if the virus doesn't affect Mac OS, you don't want to pass it on to friends, family, or colleagues who may be using a different operating system. Virex (antivirus software for Macs) is a popular antivirus software.

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Don't run services you don't need:&lt;/u&gt;
Each service you run represents a means of access to your computer. That's not inherently bad, but there's no need to expose yourself to unnecessary risks. If you don't need to run a web server on this computer, don't start it up. The list of available services can be found in System Preferences under the Services tab of the Sharing icon. Be cautious of the sharing services; a misconfiguration here could grant full access to personal files or system resources.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Choose a good password:&lt;/u&gt;
Any computer that will have multiple users or be attached to a network needs to have good password protection for each user.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Use your personal firewall:&lt;/u&gt;

While the firewall included in Mac OS is not nearly as customizable as other software firewalls, it is effective in reducing the amount of network traffic that is allowed to reach your computer. Open System Preferences and click the Sharing icon. Next, click the Firewall tab and then click Start. 

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Limit administrative access:&lt;/u&gt;
Mac OS allows you to designate certain users as system administrators. These users are allowed much greater access to the system, meaning that care should be taken when granting these privileges. If a user doesn't need to modify the system's settings, there is no reason for that user to have administrative access. All users can modify their own personal preferences. Administrative privileges grant access to system to functions such as services and patches.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Securing Your Linux Operating System:&lt;/u&gt;
There are many variants to the Linux operating system.  Here is a website that will give you information on how to secure your Linux and different versions of UNIX operating systems http://www.cites.uiuc.edu/wsg/resources/security/

4. When choosing an operating system, what are some of the things you should consider?

==Answers to Quiz==
Question 1
&lt;p&gt;
The operating system is the software that controls the computer.  Without it the computer would not be able to start. 
&lt;p&gt;
It controls the memory needed for computer processes, manages disk space, controls peripheral devices, and allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing exactly how a computer works. 
 
&lt;p&gt;
It is labeled software because software is a set of instructions that performs some task on the computer. The Operating system is the boss of all software on a computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==School Websites==

    If you are developing your school web page, chances are you have volunteered to do so or you have been co-opted by the school administration because you are the most tech savvy person on staff.  In either case, it is no minor undertaking especially because of the time involved in maintaining the site.  Some of you will have full teaching schedules; some will be the school technology coordinators who are “masters” of many areas and cannot be dedicated web masters.  Therefore it is necessary to manage time wisely. &lt;p&gt;

    School web sites follow the same principal as any other website: it must be attractive enough for people to want to revisit it.  If not, it is not worth developing.  Attractive means good design, interesting content and easy navigation.  Thane Terrill, in his book &lt;u&gt;Technology on a Shoestring: A Survival Guide for Educators and Other Professionals&lt;/u&gt;, recommends the following team if you are developing a major website:&lt;p&gt;


	*'''Graphic designer''': Focuses on the appearance and layout of the site. They also create the images and graphics for the site. &lt;p&gt;
	*'''Programmer''': Responsible for the web programming.  Many of the advanced features of modern websites require some level of programming skill.&lt;p&gt;
	*'''Database Administrator''': Handles mangement of the databases.  Frequently, a website is constructed to provide access to a currently existing database, such as student records.&lt;p&gt;
	*'''Editor''': Editing for the web is a specialized skill because the lack of screen space requires a terse writing style capable of being understood by a user skimming the text. &lt;p&gt;
	*'''Content Specialist''': Responsible for the accuracy and relevancy of the site's content.&lt;p&gt;
	*'''Publicist''': If the  site requires that the public know about it, a publicist can help get the word out.&lt;p&gt;
	*'''Attorney''': This person makes sure you don't get sued and that you secure the appropriate trademarks.&lt;p&gt;
	*'''Project Leader''': Develops the concept for the site, protects the vision for the site during the developmental process, and makes sure the group works well together. &lt;p&gt;

    No doubt, such as team requires a sizeable budget, and if executed at the district level is quite feasible; however, if you are developing your site single-handedly, you will need to combine many the skills of all of the persons mentioned above with little or no funding in order to produce an effective website. The time and commitment to create a website should not be underestimated. The following questions should guide your project: &lt;p&gt;



 

===What is the purpose of the website? ===

 


Often a school’s website provides and opportunity to celebrate students’ work and the school’s achievements and provide an effective way of communicating with the school family; but not all school sites set out to do this.  For example, a small therapeutic school in Connecticut directs all website content to prospective parents:  it outlines the school’s clinical programs, staff qualifications, academic programs and tuitions costs.  It is highly unlikely that an adolescent would be seeking this kind of placement independently of his family and so the information targets parents. &lt;p&gt;
Who will your website target? You will need to consult with the school administration in order to make this decision.  The answer to this question will determine the content because you then have to think about what information these different groups might want or find interesting. &lt;p&gt;

===What sort of content and information should be on the site?===

It would be a good idea at this point to look at other school websites and decide what features you like; what features you do not like; what seems to work well; what does not.  Just because information can be placed on your web site does not mean that it should.  Having fresh content on your Web site will encourage readers to return frequently and that is your over-riding objective: having people return to your site. Just as important as what kind of content, is how that content is presented. 

Not everyone can write content for the web.  Writing for the web requires a particular skill set Web users do not read a page word by word.  Instead, they scan the page looking for individual words or key sentences.  Web pages need to employ scannable text:  highlighted keywords, meaningful sub-headings, one idea per paragraph. The style of writing would be closest to writing for a televison news report: short and to the point.  There are may tutorials on the Web which offer guidelines; for example, [http://www.gerrymcgovern.com/guide_write_01.htm The Web Content Style Guide]

==='''Who will create and maintain the site? '''===
As the designated webmaster, you will be responsible for designing, creating, monitoring, and gathering content for your school's web site. As stated above, this is no small task and you will need help. The web site must be updated and reviewed regularly so that readers return to it. Solicit representatives from each department or each year level to feed the content to you. You may find staff members who are skilled at developing web pages and who can be counted on to post information on the web themselves. If not it would be worthwhile to facilitate a few workshops to help your team develop Web publishing skills.  Having staff members responsible for updating and posting information pertinent to their respective areas is less time consuming.

'''Note''': One of the easiest ways to create a school web page is to use a Web Content Management system or CMS.  CMS is software used to create, edit, manage and publish Web content. The system essentially provides a template or templates into which individuals can create or modify content. The advantage of such a system is that staff need very little technical knowledge to use the system and the site maintains a uniform appearance. The down side to this is that CMS sites allow for no flexibility in design. CMS is expensive to purchase, but there are many open source systems available such as Joomla.&lt;p&gt;

==='''How regularly will the site be updated? '''===


Your website must be reviewed regularly so that readers return to it.  Gather feedback from students, teachers and parents about the site’s strengths and weakness.  This will help you to make improvements when you update. Getting feedback will mean that your intended audience knows that you are there. Publicize and promote your web site through parent newsletters, announcements at meetings or placing ads in local newspapers. &lt;p&gt;
Some pages will require more time than others to maintain. For example, if homework is posted on the site, these pages will need to be updated weekly, if not daily. If pages contain many external links they have to be checked regularly to make certain the links are still viable.  That is why it is essential to have a team; one person would never be able to attend to this kind of detail unless he was a dedicated webmaster. &lt;p&gt;

==='''What software will you use to author the site? '''===
The most popular HTML editors are Dreamweaver and Microsoft Front Page.  Your choice depends on your level of skill and the end objective you have for your website.&lt;p&gt;
Microsoft FrontPage Editor is a useful HTML editor that is meant for fast website design. and is available as part of the Office Suite of applications.  Microsoft Office applications such as Word, Publisher and even PowerPoint offer the option of saving your document as a web page.  These are quite user friendly as the beginning web developers are already familiar with their layout. FrontPage is an inexpensive web design application,It does not ask much of you in terms of skills, and all you need to do is to know what you want your web page to look like. Adding website elements is quite easy and extensive tutorials are readily available in case you have a problem. Whereas Macromedia Dreamweaver  takes sometime in getting used to, particularly the interface and the myriad of options, FrontPage is designed with the novice web designer in mind and thus its approach to designing web pages is different from the start. You are automatically exposed to step-by-step methods of creating pages, and in a lot of cases you don't even need to know HTML! &lt;p&gt;
FrontPage is a different breed of HTML editor; it's targeted towards users who want to get their website up and running fast, and users who are not interested in too many extensive features. Of course, like any self-respecting HTML editor FrontPage supports the latest technology and modules but its main purpose is ease of use and simple development. In this role FrontPage is ideally suited for web designers who are looking for simple websites without many bells and whistles. &lt;p&gt;
Both FrontPage and Dreamweaver offer an HTML “hard coding” feature, but Dreamweaver is the industry standard for commercial web design. &lt;p&gt;
Dreamweaver has many more built-in features that include interactive design elements, Flash animations and even pre-coded JavaScript functions. An author has many more design tools to work with, enabling them to create websites with a more sophisticated look and feel. Because of its mainstream commercial use, Dreamweaver is an expensive application that is NOT for the design novice. &lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Special Note&lt;/b&gt;:  Americans with Disabilities Act or ADA &lt;p&gt;
The US congress amended the Rehabilitation act of 1973 to require Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. This amendment is known as section 508.  Standards were established within the act for web-based intranet and internet information and applications.  They assure accessibility to web page graphics by the visually impaired using assistive technology such as screen readers and refreshable Braille displays.  When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, all users can have equal access to information and functionality. For example, when a site is coded with semantically meaningful HTML, with textual equivalents provided for images and with links named meaningfully, this helps blind users using text-to-speech software and/or text-to-Braille hardware. When text and images are large it is easier for users with poor sight to read and understand the content. When links are underlined  as well as coloured, this ensures that color blind users will be able to notice them. When clickable links and areas are large, this helps users who cannot control a mouse with precision. When pages are coded so that users can navigate by means of the keyboard alone, or a single switch access device alone, this helps users who cannot use a mouse or even a standard keyboard. When videos are closed captioned or a sign language version is available, deaf and hard of hearing users can understand the video. When flashing effects are avoided or made optional, users prone to seizures caused by these effects are not put at risk. And when content is written in plain language and illustrated with instructional diagrams and animations, users with dyslexia and learning difficulties are better able to understand the content. When sites are correctly built and maintained, all of these users can be accommodated while not impacting on the usability of the site for non-disabled users.

Although there is no penalty at the moment for not being 508 compliant, it is a good idea to construct your pages according to the standards.&lt;p&gt;

For full accessibility guidelines see article [http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/guide/1194.22.htm 1194.22 of Section 508.]&lt;p&gt;

There are many software tools which evaluate whether your web page content is Section 508 compliant.  One such free tool is the HiSoftware Cynthia Says portal.  It is an online test which checks one page at a time and identifies which aspects are not 508 compliant.&lt;p&gt;

==='''A Comment from a Tech Coordinator'''===
There is a gap of understanding that comes from the discrepancy between the client’s ideal and the ability and time limitations of the designer. &lt;p&gt;
Most people think that because they have years of experience using Internet sites, that designing one should almost be as effortless. This akin to thinking that because you’ve been driving a car for years, building one should be as easy as snapping Legos together. &lt;p&gt;
Depending on how basic or sophisticated the site is going to be the volunteer should be brutally honest about their level of expertise and limitations This can save the school a  great deal of time and money when these matters are dealt with in the beginning. &lt;p&gt;
The school must also be very clears about their expectations. They need to be able to articulate exactly what they wish to see on their site. Do they want an event calendar, a staff email list?  Does each department have their own site? Who is responsible for providing the content for each page?  Will the students be featured? Who will secure the permissions for the students?  Do you want an online request/survey form? What exactly are they paying for? Who is responsible for upgrade and maintenance? &lt;p&gt;
To make sure all the cards are on the table, it would be prudent to query the client for this information. To make life easier, the designer could create a list of the features they would like to have on their school site and check. &lt;p&gt;  
A good site for calculating the price of your site can be found at [http://www.luciddesigns.com/Price.html Lucid Designs] &lt;p&gt;
 
Here at least can the abstract become more concrete.   Along with calculating the price of web design elements and features, the web designer can also use this opportunity to calculate the time involved in implementation.  Regardless of working for free or a fee, the client should know what this undertaking is worth in time and money.  Everyone must be on the same page at the outset in an effort to avoid misunderstanding. &lt;p&gt;

 	Technology of Filtering Programs: Blocking Child Pornography on the Internet 
				          Bryan Apt
 Child pornography.  The Internet, a prime source of free, unfettered information, leaves it vulnerable to child pornography, a very small part of what’s available on the Internet that is not readily in public view. Erotic and pornographic information, available on the Internet virtually to everyone, including children, has created a great deal of concern. Because some 20% of children (1 in 5) aged 10 to 17 have been sexually solicited over the Internet, efforts have been made to block child pornography, including the Child Online Protection Act (COPA) (1998) that had been passed and, then, struck down as unconstitutional, most recently July 22 by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. The federal appeals court, in its ruling, argued that COPA is overly broad and vague and violates the First Amendment because “filtering technologies and other parental control tools offer a less restrictive way to protect children from inappropriate content online.” (Tessler, J., A.P., July 23, 2008, 3A)
 What is child pornography?  Child pornography consists of photographs, videotapes, magazines, books, and films that depict children in sexual acts. It is illegal. Although law enforcement has begun to police the Internet, it still relies principally on a vigilant watch of cyberspace to apprehend lawbreakers and on the technology of filtering to block or screen pornography from children using the Internet. 
   But not only schools and families! Businesses are also concerned with the type of Internet materials their workers are assessing over corporate networks. Most companies simply don’t want their workers accessing that material on company time. Some companies now lease the same software parents and schools are buying, and it checks all incoming Internet traffic to every computer in the company on a vigilant watch of cyberspace to apprehend lawbreakers. 
Workplace Surveillance Methods: Many companies track the Internet behavior of their employees with “packet sniffers,” software that examines or “sniffs” every packet of data that comes across the network and stores it in a log file. Filtered “sniffers,” capture only packets that have passed into the network from specified Web sites. Which enables technical support staff to examine the file and reconstruct Internet behavior. A more insidious kind of software, called key loggers, is installed in the computers of employees without their knowledge. This software sends a record of every keystroke, which is recorded.   
Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) and the Expansion of Filtering. CIPA requires recipients of Universal Service Discounts (USD) and recipients of ESEA Title III or Library Service funds must have technology in place that filter child pornography and material harmful to minors. Local officials, however, are given the latitude to temporarily suspend filtering or blocking for research or other legal purposes.
Internet filtering technology: More effective than legislative action, however, is Internet filtering technology—software that enables parents and teachers to ensure that their children are not viewing pornographic material. A number of companies, such as Net Nanny, SurfWatch and CyberPatrol, make and sell protective software that monitors their time on the Internet.. Powerful, yet easy to install, they help parents protect their children. The software checks sites for content and bars children from sites that are unsuitable for them. Some routers, widely used for home networks, have filtering capabilities that block pornography, hate sites, questionable chat rooms, and other dangers of the Internet. In addition, they team with “Safe Search” options found in widely used search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Alta Vista, Dogpile, Lycos, AllTheWeb, and MSN. Children using search engines on the World Wide Web, when engaged in an “image only” search, will not see links to blocked sites that offer protection against pornographic images. Filtering may be implemented in a number of ways:
Filtering Services. Internet service providers, that are “child friendly,” such as AOL and MSN, offer effective filtering as a service to their customers.
Filtering Software. A number of software programs monitor Internet use and block objectionable sites on the World Wide Web as well as on less known but equally dangerous areas like Peer-to-Peer.  Downloading networks, Chat Rooms, Instant Messages, FTP, Forums, and email, they serve as effective software filters. 
A New Front in War Against Child Pornography developed last summer (July, 2007). Verizon and Time Warner Cable, two of the nation’s largest service providers that service roughly 16 million customers between them--after undercover agents of New York State revealed that Internet providers were allowing child pornography to proliferate online (but only after resistance and prolonged negotiation)--agreed to curtail access to child pornography and to purge their servers of Internet bulletin boards and Web sites that disseminate child pornography. They further agreed to purge web sites hosted on the three companies’ servers that traffic in child pornography. 
   New York State developed a new system for identifying child pornography online. Every online picture has a unique “Hash Value” that, once identified and collated, can be used to digitally match the same image wherever it is distributed. By building a library of the Hash values for images identified as child pornography, investigators are able to filter through tens of thousands of online filters at a time, speedily identifying which Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are providing access to child pornography. Investigators, by pursuing Internet service providers, essentially moved beyond the traditional enforcement strategy of confronting the producers of child pornography and their customers. Spearheaded by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, these major Internet service providers represent a significant new front on the battle against child pornography.
    Many in the communication industry, arguing that, given the decentralized and largely unmonitored nature of the Internet, they could not be responsible for content online, had previously resisted similar efforts.  But not only that! These companies, plus Sprint, agreed to shut down access to traffic in pornographic images of children on Usenet, one of the oldest outposts of the Internet that, some thirty years ago, was one of the earliest sources of information online. As the World Wide Web continued to flourish, Usenet, essentially supplanted by other search agents, became a favored back alley for traffickers in illicit material. 
   For all of the apparent progress of filtering campaigns against Internet pornography, extended by the goal of making it extremely difficult to find or disseminate pornography online, it is acknowledged that access can not be eliminated entirely. Potential obstacles include third-party companies that sell paid subscriptions that permit consumers to access newsgroups privately, thus preventing even their Internet service providers from tracking their activity. 
   However, for all of its limitations, the process of filtering to prevent child pornography on the Internet has had significant success. For while Internet usage skyrocketed, crimes against children notable declined during the last ten years.
Site Restrictions. There are some browsers that can check for special rating tags that are embedded in a website. For information about these tags, see the Internet Content Rating Association (ICRA) www.icra.org. These tags often identify content descriptors for one website or for one specific page. Users can set their browsers on pages that display “fantasy violence” but not sex. Websites with rating tags embedded in their pages do not display, for the browser is unable to ensure that the site is safe. The system of rating tags, which is not used widely, may be useful but, as of now, does not appear to be a general solution to the problem of child pornography on the Internet
How Does One Determine the Suitability of a Website? First, filter the incoming content as it enters the system. The filter is programmed to look for targeted words or images that may have “too many flesh tones.” Such filters, however, are unable to eliminate sites on sex education or breast cancer. (Terrill, 2006) Moreover, while looking for email messages with targeted words, the filter may be unable to recognize “s*e*x” as “sex.” Porno spammers, though, know the limits of common filters and designs around them. Scanning images is tricky. Which is why, flawed though content filters often are, schools have little choice but to consider them. For they may be able to block a hitherto unknown bad web site.
 Second method. The second method is based on lists of “good” and “bad” sites. A number of firms that do little but label websites send out regular updates of the “good” and “bad” lists to the subscribers, who may add their sites to the list.
   Search engines are a new area of concern, Google, by using the “cache” option on its  search result page, can allow its users to see websites without having actually to visit the sites. Google keeps copies of web pages on their site. Even after a website has been removed, Google may still be able to display its contents.
   Images are another area of concern. Google permits users to search for images without visiting the site from which the image resides. A student can enter the name of a famous person into a search engine’s image search engine and come up with a listing of nude and seminude images. One protective measure you can take with Google is to turn on its built-in filter called SafeSearch. This setting offers protection both against “adult” images and text.
   Few have the time to look for all the ways to evade the filters—but evidently students do. Which is why there is no effective substitute for simply watching the students. It’s not hard to spot the reaction when students stumble across pornography they should not have found. Hopefully, one can block that website in a short while. In addition, computer-based logging programs can be used to track student activity. If the students have found their way around the filter, the log files will indicate this. Throughout, the age of the student and concerns for privacy should be weighed against the student’s protection. For the protection required for a high school student differs than that for a third grader.  
Debate about use of filtering programs has stirred controversy in the education community. Pro-filtering advocates believe that the filters do a good job in disallowing children into inappropriate sites. Anti-filtering proponents feel that the filtering software keeps children out of sites that hold appropriate information but  “inappropriate” words. Questioned, also, is the “moral compass” used in filtering software. It is maintained that teachers should be able to teach children what to avoid without having children locked out of sites by filtering
Effective is a Combination of Filtering Systems, Education, and Vigil.  While freedom of the web may work well in secondary education, it seems it is too great a risk to include pornographic sites in elementary education. A single moment on one of these sites may be all it takes to increase prurient interest or to initiate desensitization to such images. Hence, it is recommended that a combination of filtering systems, teaching, and vigil be employed at the elementary level. The mere presence of an educator should not be underestimated. Having a teacher nearby and actively interested in what the students are pursuing on the Internet can effectively deter inappropriate access. Having computers situated in rooms where the screen content can be viewed by the teacher at all times is also a good classroom deterrent.
   Images, we noted above, are also a concern.  Student may enter the name of a famous person into a search engine’s image and retrieve questionable images. One protective measure you can use is to turn on SafeSearch a built-in filter that protects against both “adult” images and texts.
   Although it does not seem that one has the time to search for all the ways around the filters, students seem to find the ways. There is little option, then, but to simply watch the students and quickly block a questionable website. Also, you can also use computer-based log files to keep track of the activities of students. The age of the student and concerns for privacy should be weighed against the student’s right for privacy and protection-- the protection required for a high school student differs from that of a third grader.
PICS.  One group working on the issue is Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS), which is trying to give parents control over the type of material that their children can access. PICS is trying to develop industry standards for technology that would allow the content of all sites and documents on the Internet to be rated according to their suitability for children, Additionally, the group would create standards that would enable software to be developed to block sites based on those suitability ratings.
    But not only schools and families! Businesses are also concerned with the type of Internet materials their workers assess over corporate networks. Retrieving and displaying sexual material can be interpreted as sexual harassment, and can lead to serious legal ramifications. In addition, most companies don’t want their workers accessing that material on company time. Some companies now lease the same software parents and schools are buying. Instead of installing the software on individual computers, however, the software is installed on a server, which checks all incoming Internet traffic to every computer in the company.
How Parental Controls Work.  (1) The SurfWatch software the URL of every address coming toward the TCP/IP stack. It searches for five types of URLs: http, nntp, ftp, gopher, and IRC—the ones most likely to contain objectionable material. It puts each into its own separate “box.” It allows the rest of the Internet data coming in to go through.
(2_ SurfWatch software is installed on  a computer that a parent wants to monitor to ensure that children can not get to objectionable material on the Internet. When a child launches software to get onto the Internet, SurfWatch latches onto Winsock or MacTCP, depending on whether a PC or Macintosh is being used. A SurfWatch software module sits “in front” of Winsock or MacTCP and monitors the TCP/IP data stream coming to the TCP/IP stack. 
Conclusion. Although child pornography on the Internet may form only a small percent of Internet content, it possesses a huge challenge for society. To protect children from child pornography, the use of a filtering system is an effective way to block pornography. In addition, an essential partnership between major servers, such as AOL, Verizon, and Time Warner, and parents, educators, and librarians will further reduce the incidence of child pornography. Hotlines are a mechanism for receiving complaints from the public, collecting intelligence for law enforcement, removing illegal content from servers, and providing safety education. In short, an effective partnership against pornography seems to be emerging. 
For a Summary of How Parental Controls Work, See Diagrams One and Two, Page 10, Below. 
   The oval-shaped Surf/Watch module looks for and screens http, nntp, ftp, gopher, IRC, which are most likely to contain objectionable material, from their respective boxes.
  SurfWatch checks thousands of sites and indexes those found to be objectionable. URLs in each of the boxes are checked against those from objectionable sites, blocking the site so that information can’t be viewed. 
  Not only images that offend but offensive words as well!  SurfWatch looking for objectionable words, pattern matching, alerts the child that the site has been blocked, preventing that information from being viewed. 
   In addition, SurfWatch employs a rating system, Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS), to determine if objectionable material can be found among the documents. Objectionable material is blocked, preventing it from entering the TCP/IP stack. As above, the child is alerted that the site has been blocked.
   If the URL is not found objectionable, it is passed to the TCP/IP stack and then to the Internet software, where the child can view it and interact with it. SurfWatch does the checking instantaneously so there is no apparent delay in getting material from the Internet.
   Because of the furious growth of the Internet, new sites are created frequently. SurfWatch, to keep from being dated, automatically updates the data of sites every month, keeping the list of sites current.
   Businesses, to prevent workers from accessing objectionable sites over corporate networks, have the SurfWatch software installed on a site through which all Internet traffic must travel, filtering Internet traffic for the entire company.

An example from the corporate world, this Senior Technical Trainer shows that security is a major concern for her clients, however she is able to reduce their concern with some specific details and by staying positive. Remember, if you are trying to pitch your system to teachers and parents— be positive. Instead of listing all the problems that could potential happen (not an effect way to be persuasive), list all the solutions and security steps you plan to use. Take a note from this corporate trainer and address security concerns while staying positive and being confident.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Wikis, blogs, eBooks, and ePortfolios== 
The explosion of the Internet worldwide and the usefulness of its websites has been a turning point in societal exchange of information.  In the educational field, websites are an excellent way for providing information and resources for both teachers and students.  And the wide use of the Internet has caused many changes of standards and redefinition of terms and concepts and created the need for a level of technology literacy.  And like all things technology based, a new version comes along and we must adapt once again.  Enter, Web 2.0.

=====Web 2.0=====

Web 2.0 is at term “describing the trend in the use of World Wide Web technology and web design that aims to enhance creativity, information sharing, and, most notably, collaboration among users” (Wikipedia).  It differs from ‘Web 1.0’, the earlier use of the Internet, in that it is based more on interaction.  Users are not just creating websites and retrieving information, rather users collaborate on different aspects, from websites, to image manipulation, to audio/video mixing.  A self publishing mode has taken over users of the internet, particularly the youth, and people are becoming much more ‘social’.  More communication is taking place and email is not the sole way to discuss or share information.  For discussion of interests and popular topics, in addition to project based work, wikis and blogs are two very popular tools that are now widely used on the web.

=====It’s all just reading and writing, so why bother with these things?=====
Technology changes so fast that it’s hard to keep up: blogs, wikis, Facebook, twitter, and you can bet that there’s more coming. Why bother trying to keep up when it’s all just reading and writing? Print books, paper and pencil, and maybe some word processing—shouldn’t that be enough of the basics to prepare students? The simple answer is no. 


No, those basics are not enough. New technologies have extended and enhanced the definition of meaningful literacy practice. Texts are produced, distributed, and received in new ways.  For students to be considered fully literate, they must develop skills to find, select, comprehend, evaluate, and compose information using new technology (Larson, 126). The skills students need to master reading online are different than the skills they need to read and retain information from a print text. Writing for wikis, blogs, and traditional paper require different voices, different understandings of audience, and different types of referencing. Students should have practice switching between these different types of writing with guidance, feedback, and support from a teacher. 


“Electronic technologies are changing the forms by which people communicate with each other and understand the world. Changes in technology have and will continue to change the nature of literacy practices in society, and the cognitive and social skills needed to be considered fully literate” (MacArthur, 248).


Bottom line, we can compare incorporating digital literacy skills in the classroom to teaching a man to fish. Omitting these important skills from the classroom is equivalent to telling a man that a thing called a fish can be caught and lives in the ocean (which the man may or may not have experience sailing but has definitely seen on TV). One man will clearly succeed and the other is likely to starve. Students need to be exposed to these communication technologies in an environment that lets them practice and develop important new skills. The basic skills have changed and students need to master new skills to be considered fully literate and to grow into effective communicators.

=====Adding to the basics, not replacing them=====
In making the argument that basic literary skills have changed, it is important to stress that these changes do not replace tried-and-true literacy practice. Some people view digital forms of reading and writing as a threat to the hierarchy that places print books and academic writing at the top. But it’s not a case of pushing the king off the top of the hill. New literacies can be, and often are, intertwined with traditional literacy practices (Larson, 122). Learning with technology does not replace or diminish current standards. Remember after all, “writing itself is a technology” (MacArthur, 248) and it’s continuously being updated. Learning with new communication technologies actively engages students in important literacy practices and prepares students for the new ways that texts are produced and received. 


Digital technologies have broadened the definition of literacy and require practice and development of skills that support and build on traditional academic literacies. Incorporating these technologies into classrooms is necessary for developing fully literate students. As educators and technical coordinators in schools, we must strive to encourage the connection of new and traditional literacies in the classroom while making time for activities that involve on-screen reading and for-screen writing.

==Blogs==


=====What is a blog?=====

A Blog, in its simplest form, is a website that is an online journal.  A combination of two words, web and log, a blog allows a ‘blogger’ to create postings on any subject.  Blogs are different from a written journal in that upon first entry, the last posting is viewed first -- reverse chronological order.  On the technical side blogs are ‘a hierarchy of text, images, media objects and data, arranged chronologically, that can be viewed in an HTML browser” (Winer). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By being an avid blogger one is classified as being part of the ‘blogosphere’, the social networking community of blogs.  And there are many different communities to be a part of.  There are blogs for pretty much every subject.  Everyone has their very own late night talk show where they can rant, rave, share, and discuss their interests.  Also, there are blogs that aren’t just written posts.  We have video blogs, picture blogs, and even audio blogs (podcasts), where the blogger will publish some different type of media on their site.  But, written blogs are often most common. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Blogs have often been compared to discussion board in that they both allow for interaction between students, as well as the teacher.  However, the main difference between blogs and discussion boards is the level of ownership.  Within discussion boards students interact with each other and share ideas, but no student has control over the content of that collaborative space.  Blogs on the other hand allow students to take the reins and have control over the content.  At the same time, students can collaborate with each other, as blogs allow for students to comment on the work of the other.  This tool allows for both individualistic creativity as well as collaborative cooperation.

=====Why Blogs?=====

Literacy is an integral part of a student’s education.  Students must have the ability to read and write to express their opinions and ideas.  Often times in the class there may be students who are a bit introverted, or others who have a hard time expressing themselves in front of the class verbally.  Blogs provide these students with a platform to contribute to a discussion that they may not necessarily contribute to inside of the class.  The reflective nature of blogs gives students comfort and ease in expressing their ideas that may not be possible immediately in a classroom.  Students can develop confidence in their ability to formulate and opinion and may be more vocal in class at a later time.  Students still feel engaged in the class and are less likely to get unmotivated because they can now contribute in their own way.  At the same time, students can have much more experience writing and teachers can access student development over time from their constant blog posts.

=====Composition of Blog Posts=====

Certain standard features are available within all blogs:

*Post Title:  A post is an entry on the blog.  Users have the ability to name the post anything they choose.

*Time Stamp:  Each post is stamped with the time that it was created, enabling visitors to know when information is posted, and keep track of how often posts are made.

*Links: Links allow the blogger to connect their posts to other websites and even connect their blogs to other blogs that are on the web.

*Comments:  Bloggers allow visitors to leave comments about their posts.  Comments are also time-stamped and visitors can communicate directly with the blogger on individual posts or in general.

*Archives:  Allows a blogger to store information on a month by month basis within the year.  All posts for that time are grouped together, allowing for easy retrieval.

=====Podcasts=====
Since we have discussed blogs, it is imperative for us to talk a little bit about podcasts.  'ipod' and 'broadcast' are the two words that were combined to create the name 'podcast.  Podcasts are audio files that are uploaded to a web page for download.  Essentially it is blogging with audio.  Podcasts can have their own sites or can be incorporated into a blog.  There is some confusion about the name 'podcast' as it implies that one needs to have an iPod.  Anyone who has an mp3 player or a computer can listen to a podcast.  Users can use RSS feeds to receive notification when a new file has been uploaded to the site and can download it to their mp3 player or their computer for listening. Users can choose to download the new audio or stream it from the website.  A link is provided with the notification that will take you to where the file is stored.  Instructors can use this for new course announcements.  Language teachers can use this tool to give assignments for students to practice listening skills of a second language. In collaboration with blogs an instructor can get a certain concept across to a student and have them respond with their opinions while they are outside of the classroom.

==Wikis==

=====Wiki Who? Wiki Why? Wiki How?=====
[[Image:HNL Wiki Wiki Bus.jpg|thumb|right|Wiki Wiki Bus]]
What to wiki?? Oh, that’s not one of the options.  Well neither is ‘who’ or ‘why’, but definitely ‘how’.  ‘Wiki how’ is a component of the very popular Wikipedia.  Wikipedia is an online line encyclopedia that has collaborators from all parts of the world.  It is the most used wiki online, so much so that it is now used as a verb, “Wiki it”, when telling someone to look for information on Wikipedia.  So what is a wiki anyway?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The word ‘wiki’ is Hawaiian for ‘fast’. It has been suggested that ‘wiki’ means ‘What I Know Is’” (Wikipedia).  A wiki is ‘a software tool that allows users to freely create and edit hyperlinked web pages using a browser” (Ribble and Bailey).  Most wiki interfaces are similar to word processing program interfaces with options to modify font size, color, style, etc.  Wikis allow you to edit pages, create new pages, and add links to rich media files.  The great thing about wikis is that if you make a mistake or want to add something that you previously saved, you can always revert back to a previously saved version.  This is a wonderful feature that is different from normal websites.  With wikis, you have a constant history of everything you have changed and can retrieve it at any time.

===== Why Use A Wiki? =====
“If we accept the premise that knowledge is an artifact created by a community of knowledgeable peers constituted by the language of that community and that learning is social and not an individual process, then to learn is not to assimilate information and improve our mental eyesight. To learn is to work collaboratively to establish and maintain among a community of knowledgeable peers...” (Brody and Wallace).  A Wiki is a tool that embodies this concept fully.  Students can share resources that they create, amongst themselves, in addition to annotating previously existing documents.   Additionally, wikis promote more attentiveness towards writing.  Students often do research papers of a certain caliber and know that the instructor will only see it.  However, when a student is writing on a wiki there is more of a consciousness about what they are writing and how they are writing as their work will be viewed by many different people.  It raises the bar to an extent and can encourage competition and instill the drive for perfection.

==Really Simple Syndication (RSS)==

With all of the discussion of blogs and wikis, and the collaboration that both of them facilitate, we must realize that information may be updated on a daily basis.  If someone is reading many blogs, or collaborating in a wiki with someone, it can be time consuming to online and check every single website for new information.  This is where RSS feeds come in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:RSS.png|left]]RSS started out being referred to as Rich Site Summary as far back as 1999 by Netscape.  Several attempts at effective syndication were not reached until late 2002when RSS 0.94 was upgraded to RSS 2.0.  At this point the name was changed to what we now use today.  Technically, RSS “is an XML-based format for content distribution” (RSS Specifications).  ‘Feeds’ allow the user to have specific content delivered to a RSS reader.  All major newspapers now have RSS subscriber buttons on their website that allow visitors to choose which part of the newspaper they would like to receive updates about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:RSS icon.svg|left]]For educators this is a very handy tool.  Instructors can be kept apprised of new projects that other schools are working on that is related to their subject area.  Schools can set up a blog to have an RSS feed that will allow teachers, parents and even students to obtain new information pertinent to the school.  This cuts down on mass emails and even paper distribution that a school may solely rely on.



==eBooks==
====What is an eBook?====
[[Image:Laptop-ebook.jpg|thumb|right|A user viewing an [[electronic page]] on an eBook-reading device]]

Available in several formats, eBooks are just what they sound like—electronic versions of full-text books. Students download the texts and screen-read eBooks on desktop computers, laptops, and handheld devices that include readers, PDAs, and some mobile phones. Similar to traditional print books, eBooks can include combinations of text and image. eBooks may also incorporate multimodal features such as animation, sound, music, video, and hyperlinks. 


Students can purchase eBooks from online bookstores, borrow them from online libraries, or access them for free from several other online resources (Larson, 122). As long as the technology to view the eBooks is accessible to students, eBooks are easy to download and cost significantly less than purchasing print books; typically US$3.99 with no shipping and handling (Larson, 123). 


Text editing tools enable students to mark passages by highlighting, underlining, or crossing out words. Students are also able to add text or audio comments, attach files, and manipulate the text size and screen layout. Traditional print conventions for navigating texts (such as table of contents and pagination) become less functional in eBook format. However, particularly useful ‘search’ features allow readers of eBooks to instantaneously locate specific words or phrases within the text and select specific pages to view (Larson, 123). 


Students have reported enjoying the convenience of storing eBook on the computer without the worry of misplacing the hard copy. However, students also reported the following disadvantage of using eBooks: 

• they were easily distracted while reading because of the internet access on the device they were reading from 

• they lacked and missed the tangible interaction with a printed text

• some lost portability of texts and had to read in front of a screen in one location (Larson, 123). 


While the issue of portability is lessened through the use of handheld reading devices, the first two disadvantages (distraction and difficult connecting to the text) highlight the need to practice and develop on-screen reading skills that are different from print reading skills.

====Why eBooks?====
More and more critical reading is being pushed on-screen as emails, web-browsing, and social networking sites become dominate features in everyday life. Incorporated into the classroom, eBooks can help to develop important on-screen reading ability as well as promote reading comprehension, literacy development, and personal meaning making. eBooks can be used to build important critical reading skills that support academic literacy while engaging in digital literacy development.
	

====Sample eBook Assignment: Electronic Reading Workshop====
Incorporated into the classroom as features of electronic reading workshops (ERWs), eBooks help develop important on-screen reading skills in addition to developing the goals of traditional print reading workshops. Four common aspects of any reading workshop are: 

1) Literature selection 

2) Literature response journals 

3) Literature conversations

4) Project response options.


ERWs incorporate technology into all four aspects of reading workshop, including above mentioned blogs, and provide multiple opportunities for new literacy practice and integration of technology. ERWs use the following technologies to fit in each of the four aspects of a reading workshop:

1) Literature selection- eBooks 

2) Literature response journals- blogs 

3) Literature conversations- synchronous or asynchronous online discussions (threaded discussion groups, chat rooms)

4) Project response options- technology-based projects, such as 
internet publishing, youtube videos, multimedia presentations. 


ERWs help prepare students by integrating new digital literacies for on-screen reading and for-screen writing with traditional academic literacy skills.

==ePortfolios==

====What is an ePortfolio?====
A portfolio, electronic or paper, is an organized collection of completed work. ePortfolios were born out of faculty-assigned, print-based student portfolios dating back to the mid-80s. In print portfolios, as well as today’s ePortfolios, students collected their work, received feedback, selected examples to showcase, and reflected on what they learned. (Lorenzo &amp; Ittelson, 4). Definitions of ePortfolios vary, but typically all involve the development of a digital space to archive student work where they, their classmates, their teachers, and their parents can see and potentially add comments. ePortfolios have become increasingly popular for student-use, teacher-use, and corporate-use as a way to track learning and development. ePortfolios can be used as records of students’ learning experiences as well as tools to develop students’ digital literacy skills.


An ePortfolio is a digital collection of artifacts. These artifacts can include texts, graphics, videos, audio files, and other multimedia elements. ePortfolio artifacts are archived to a website or other electronic media such as a CD-ROM or DVD. Student work can be added, commented on, and reviewed in a variety of custom ways. There are seemingly limitless ways to managing and organizing ePortfolios. Several companies, including BlackBoard, WebCT, SCT, Nuventive, Concord, and McGraw-Hill, either have or are currently developing ePortfolio tools (Batson, 2).


More than a simple collection work, an ePortfolios can also serve as an administrative tool to document learning over time. ePortfolios encourage personal reflection and involve the exchange of ideas and feedback. Concisely defined ePortfolios are a “personalized, digital collections of work, responses to work, and reflections that are used to demonstrate key skills and accomplishments for a variety of contexts and time periods” (Lorenzo &amp; Ittelson, 3).

====Why ePortfolios?====

ePortfolios make students' work organized and searchable as well as transportable and lasting. They offer a better tool for us to manage, review, reflect, and comment on student work. Teachers and administrators have recognized that ePortfolios have the potential to:


• Create a system of tracking student work over time, in a single course and over several years

• Aggregate many students' work in a particular course to see how the students as a whole are progressing toward learning goals  

• Integrate digital literacy skills around current curriculum learning goals  

• Encourage continuity of student work from semester to semester in linked courses 

• Help students become critical thinkers and aid in the development of their writing and multimedia communication skills. 


ePortfolios give students the opportunity to create a digital showcase of their academic work and digital literacy skills that can be presented to a variety of audiences, including parents, funding organizations, college admissions committees, and prospective student employers.

====Components of an ePortfolio====

An ePortfolio can include a wide range of information. Some common components are:

• Personal information

• Personal values and interests

• Goals and plans

• Coursework – assignment &amp; projects

• Self-reflections 

• Peer comments

• Instructor comments

• Presentations, papers, and multimedia projects – final &amp; draft versions

• Recognition – awards and certificates (Siemens).


====Questions to consider:====

An ePortfolio archives successes, failures, and struggles in a students learning experiences. It is a compilation of work-in-progress and taken out of context, could misrepresent intended meaning. Like any web resource, ePortfolios are subject to security and privacy risks.


In addition to security and privacy risks, other questions to think about include:

• Should an e-portfolio be an official record of a student’s work? 

• How long should students’ ePortfolios be saved, stored, and accessible?

• Who owns the ePortfolio? 

• How are ePortfolios evaluated in a manner that is both valid and reliable?



Other implementation questions that involve hardware and software requirements include:

• How will an e-portfolio system impact other software systems, such as an institution’s course management system (CMS), student information system (SIS), and databases? 

• How many and what kind of servers will be necessary to hold increasing numbers of ePortfolios? What will be needed to maintain and back up these servers? 

• What plugins, file formats, and browsers will be required or supported in any e-portfolio system? 

• Is there an adequate staff to develop, deploy, and maintain the system? 

• Will there be an infrastructure in place to properly train students, faculty, and administrators how to use the e-portfolio system?

==Uses &amp; Benefits==
'''See a video interview discussing usage of blogs and wikis in education.''' http://www.youtube.com/v/GC6WsBQW6T8&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is a need for digital literacy in our current information age.  Students must have a degree of know-how to maneuver around a computer and basic software.  Tools like blogs and wikis not only encourage and facilitate literacy standards that schools must adhere to but also support basic computer literacy that students will need as a foundation for future learning.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In higher education, wikis can be used to facilitate communication between teachers in a university that are teaching the same course.  Instructors can share developed learning material, links to materials on the web, articles in journals, articles that other instructors have written and discuss the student reaction to the course subject.  This increased communication can assist departments in developing programs that are tailored to the students’ interests and offer courses that will increase enthusiasm for the subject and perhaps student enrollment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A wiki can be used to have students begin a portfolio for the year.  Students can each be given the responsibility of creating a history of their work over in a certain course, or many, over the semester and collaborate with their classmates.  Students can post notes, create study guides, post their media projects, images and create a whole year experience.  This can be left for the next year of students who can add on to this wiki, or even begin creating another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a K-12 environment which may often be smaller institutions, a blog can be a great facilitator in increase teacher morale and increase the interaction between the school and the surrounding community.  Like some corporations that have an ‘Employee of the Month’ program, schools can have a ‘Teacher of the Month’.  A blog can create a platform for teachers in the school to recognize the work of their colleagues.  Teachers can post things that they have witnessed (positive please) that illustrates what it means to be an educator.  At the end of the month an administrator can determine which teacher should be chosen.  A blog can also be used for school announcements and for hearing the voice of parents and others in the surrounding community.   This, however, should be careful planned out as to not have an open forum for school bashing.

=====Assessment=====
Due to the very nature of blogs and wikis, that allow a user to have much control over content, it is imperative for instructors to monitor and guide posting on these tools.  Students should be given the chance to explore and to be creative, at the same time there are elements that the instructor aims to have the student embody.  For this reason it is necessary that a structure is created for students when using blogs and wikis.  Students should be aware of what they will be graded on and what things the instructor is looking for when reading their posts.  Below is a sample of an assignment for a blog and wiki:

&lt;u&gt;Sample Blog Assignment&lt;/u&gt;: Poetry Reflection&lt;br&gt;
*	Read the poem on conformity located here: http://www.commongroundconsulting.org/values/conformity.cfm
*	Answer the following questions: (Your post should be at least 2 paragraphs)
**	What feeling did you have after reading the poem?&lt;br&gt;
**	Have you ever felt like this? &lt;br&gt;
**What things can be done to prevent someone from constantly feeling this way?&lt;br&gt;
**	Do you think writing helps you overcome or express certain feelings?&lt;br&gt;
*	Comment on two of your classmates posts (at least  1 paragraph)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Sample Wiki Assignment&lt;/u&gt;:  Media Analysis
(Students may choose to work together)
*	Create a wiki that will be a study of specific American newspaper
*	Your wiki should include
**	History of the paper&lt;br&gt;
**	Discussion of main writing style and any changes over time&lt;br&gt;
**	Images of how the paper has visually changed over time &lt;br&gt;
**	Links to an online paper&lt;br&gt;
**	Discussion of any influence of this on the average American&lt;br&gt;
**	Statistics of its readership and how the paper is accessed&lt;br&gt;
**	An interview with an avid reader of this paper&lt;br&gt;
**	A section for ‘Dissension’ &amp; ‘Editorial’&lt;br&gt;
**	One short article that you would submit for publication (min. 1 page)&lt;br&gt;
*	Each student will comment on the wiki of another paper explaining why they are not a fan (Dissension Section)
*	Each student will comment on the article posted by a classmate (Editorial Section)

==Acceptable Use Policy==
&lt;u&gt;'''What is an Acceptable Use Policy?'''&lt;/u&gt;
An Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) (as applied to education) is a written agreement that outlines the terms and conditions for using technology in a school district as well as  personal technology used on the school property during school hours. This document should be signed annually by all active members of a school District including employees, students and parents.  A model AUP is provided by the US Department of Justice at http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/rules/acceptableUsePolicy.htm .

The AUP may include information on

•	the instructional philosophies that will be supported through the incorporation of the Internet and technology 
        within the school environment
•	benefits associated with the incorporation of technology
•	 a code of conduct detailing expectations, consequences and safety with regards to the use of technology
•	Ways in which students can use technology in accordance with the stated regulations
•	roles and responsibilities of technology employees
•	a statement regarding legal compliance.  
•	a place for signatures

&lt;u&gt;'''Instructional philosophy'''&lt;/u&gt;
In this section of the document, the District’s instructional philosophy should be included as well as information regarding how the incorporation of technology addresses this philosophy. A school’s instructional philosophy should be developed independent of the AUP but, within the AUP, the ways in which technology will enhance the instructional philosophy should be discussed.
 
&lt;u&gt;'''Benefits'''&lt;/u&gt;
Benefits associated with the incorporation of technology in a school District should be included in the AUP. Such benefits include anything that is created by or facilitated by the integration of technology including teaching or administrative tasks. These may include (but are not limited to) the perks of e-mail, the necessity of gaining information from the Internet, and the utilization of interactive whiteboards (Smartboards) and other curriculum-enhancing technology. Also included is the access and exchange of information; communications; and the organization, analysis and presentation of information.

&lt;u&gt;'''The code of conduct'''&lt;/u&gt; 

Within this section, there must be a detail of all expectations of technology use, consequences of misuse, and safety related to proper use. Forms of banned software, hardware and technology -based applications including websites must be detailed to insure that users utilize technology in accordance with the stated policy. If, for example, a policy includes the term “the access or transmission of materials using district technology resources which are inappropriate in the school environment is strictly prohibited” there must also be a list of offences which would be included in the definition of ”inappropriate in the school environment”. Without the explicit list, a debatable area may exist in regards to the definition which may defeat the purpose of creating an AUP.
Expectations may include (but are not limited to)

•	Students must respect and protect the privacy of others by not sharing passwords, by not accessing other’s accounts 
        and by keeping private information private.
•	Students must respect and protect the intellectual property of others by not violating copyright laws and by not 
        plagiarizing as well as “stealing” other’s digital property.
•	Students must respect and practice the principles of community by only communicating in an ethical manner, by 
        reporting inappropriate material to an adult and by not utilizing material in an illegal manner or using illegal  
        material.
The above are examples of guidelines that may be present in an AUP. These come from the model AUP posted at the link above provided by the USDOJ.

Also included in this section, should be the need to address Internet filtering (see below), cyberethics and cybersafety (see below) as well as the penalties associated with the misuse of District technology or personal technology during school hours on school property. For each expectation there should be a consequence addressing non-compliance.  Such consequences can range from loss of on campus technology privileges to penalties associated with breaking a Federal or State law. 
Sections on personal and system safety should address the need to ban the sharing of username/passwords, entering chat rooms, posting personal information and accessing inappropriate material such as pornography or violent content. Also, restrictions on accessing information that could harm a system such as spam or viruses with the intent to disrupt the network should be included in the AUP. Other information which addresses the breaches in Internet or Intranet security by members of the school community or by unrelated persons should be explicitly included as well. Also included in this document should be a description of security measures that currently exist as well as a plan to address the needed security with new technology. A description of data and network security is important. Many of these safety regulations could be included as part of the expectations. However, it is important to include security information as well as a verbal or written explanation of the reasons why the security guidelines are in place. 

&lt;u&gt;'''What is Internet filtering?'''&lt;/u&gt;

Internet filtering blocks users from accessing sites that may contain material deemed inappropriate. Twenty-one States have Internet-filtering laws that apply to public schools and libraries. These laws stem from the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) which grants federal funds to public schools which abide by the outlined regulations. Such regulations require the School Board to adopt an Internet use policy (many create an AUP which covers Internet use) that limits and/or bans minors from gaining access to inappropriate materials such as explicit sexual content or other harmful sites.

To accomplish adequate filtering, some states require that the public schools install filtering software to insure that all explicit content is filtered. Filtering software blocks sites based on words, phrases or other criteria. Many users have found that certain words that may not refer to an explicit site resulted in a blocked search because of their sexual or harmful connotations. For example, creating a filter based on the word “breast” will block all sexually explicit content as well as potentially blocking chicken recipes, science-related topics and other content that may be useful for an educational environment. Additionally, some filtered software recognize a combination of letters and therefore may block searches that contain the same letters as an explicit term. Lastly, some filtering software has been known to block non offensive material such as information on certain religions and cultures.

Internet filtering software can also block specific websites such as YouTube. Often, such blocked sites may provide benefits to teachers. Districts may want to analyze the Internet filtering software that they are incorporating to allow different users access to different materials. For example, while YouTube as a lot of inappropriate material for students, it also has a plethora of video lessons and clips which can supplement a teacher’s lesson. Students have grown up in a technological environment which often means that they have learned how to surpass or to override certain barriers associated with the use of technology. Because of their familiarity with Internet filtering, many students are able to get around blocked websites by accessing them through different country codes or by using different search terms. 

When purchasing and implementing Internet filtering software, school districts must research the best software for their particular needs. Taking into consideration terms and sites that may need to be blocked along with material that may not need to be restricted is important when implementing the correct software. Additionally, districts may consider providing a code for teachers or administrators to override certain restricted searches in case there is an exception. Science teachers may have many of the terms for certain units of study, like reproduction, blocked but, given a code, could filter the useful material from the sites that could be harmful. 

&lt;u&gt;'''What are cyberethics and cybersafety?'''&lt;/u&gt;

With the rise of Internet use comes the increase in potential danger. In a world of anonymity, children are faced with the threats of online bullying, predators and a plethora of inappropriate material. Without guidance, children can communicate with unknown users, share personal information and access sites that could provide potential dangerous information.  In 2000, Janet Reno issued a letter to parents regarding the need to educate their children on appropriate Internet behavior as well as the ethics and responsibility associated with using the Internet. A website www.cybercitizenship.org was created to address these issues. Two years later, President George W. Bush announced efforts to promote online safety by encouraging parents to teach their children how to stay safe while online as well as by addressing the growing issue of child pornography. Through his efforts, many child pornography rings were disbanded, and many predators were prosecuted. Also through his initiative, many sites have been created to address the growing need to educate and to guide safe Internet use. Links to such sites can be found at http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/cyberethics.htm 

&lt;u&gt;'''Student uses'''&lt;/u&gt;

The AUP may include a section which details the ways in which students can use technology in accordance with the AUP. These uses may be ones that fall in a grey area of technology use. These may include (but are not limited to)

•	Design and post websites using school technologies and other materials that relate to school curriculum or events. 
        Because websites, like MySpace and Facebook, may be banned, it is important for students to understand that they can 
        create a website as long as it addresses a topic related to school like clubs, projects or community service.
•	Use communication software for school purposes with teacher permission. Instant messaging and other online chat 
        software would not be in compliance with most AUPs. However, under certain circumstances, IM and other chat software 
        may be necessary to fulfill a school purpose. Students must understand that there is a difference between personal and 
        educational uses of such resources and therefore must receive permission to utilize such software on school grounds or 
        during school hours.
•	Install software as long as it is within licensing agreements and with teacher permission. For example, certain movie 
        or music software may have educational uses. iTunes and other digital media software may not be an appropriate 
        installation on school computers unless there is a specific educational purpose. When a student as defined this 
        purpose and received permission to download, he/she will no longer be in violation of stipulations laid out in the AUP.

&lt;u&gt;'''Legal compliance'''&lt;/u&gt;

The AUP must include a statement that proves that the document complies with state and federal telecommunication regulations as well as a statement that details the need to comply with fair-use policies and copyright laws. Copyrighting and plagiarism may be addressed in other places, but the legal ramifications attached to these items should be explicitly stated. There have been many concerns that the AUP infringes on First Amendment Rights but the legal system has supported the need for such policies to ensure the safety of children. 

&lt;u&gt;'''Roles and responsibilities'''&lt;/u&gt;

This document may outline the roles and responsibilities of all members of the school community including District personal, parents, students and teachers. Within this section, the document should address the ongoing professional development for all members of the community. At the end of the document, there should be information on the process by which the District will reevaluate and modify the AUP. Additionally, a statement regarding supervision and monitoring on a administrative level. Many schools reserve the right to monitor Internet and technology use including e-mail and websites. A statement such as “Administrators reserve the right to examine, use, and disclose any data found on the school's information networks in order to further the health, safety, discipline, or security of any student or other person, or to protect property. They may also use this information in disciplinary actions, and will furnish evidence of crime to law enforcement”( taken from the USDOJ site linked above) to insure that all school users understand that information sent or received over a school district’s system is the property of the school district. This, again, may seem like a violation of privacy, but district’s technically own their computer systems and therefore all users are simply that, users of someone else’s system. 

&lt;u&gt;'''Signatures'''&lt;/u&gt;

At the bottom of the document should be a place for the signatures of the students, teachers and parents to insure that the document has been read and reviewed by all. By signing the document, all users are agreeing to the terms and conditions stated in the AUP. He/she understands that the district may own all material on its computer system and each user must use all technology in compliance with the signed AUP. Without a signed AUP, a member of the school community may not be able to access school technology. 


'''&lt;u&gt;Why do schools need AUPs and how are they developed?'''&lt;/u&gt;

In order to keep the school environment safe, an Acceptable Use Policy is necessary to insure that only appropriate information is accessible to students. Additionally, an AUP is necessary to regulate and to standardize the appropriate uses of all technologies present on school grounds. With the development of new technologies, the guidelines present in the AUP should be continuously updated. A committee of users including teachers, students, parents and administrators should be included in developing and maintaining the district’s AUP. The AUP may be written based on guidelines set forth my State mandates or national recommendations and may need certain criteria for the district to qualify for State or Federal funding. Because different states have different requirements, committees should investigate such requirements before beginning the writing process to insure that the AUP is complete and accurate. There is a vast amount of information that can be included in the AUP. Therefore, the committee members must include regulations, expectations and consequences that they feel relate to their district. In a sense, the AUP must be personalized to each school district based on the technology, uses and community members of each district. Committee members and their responsibilities as well as the AUP updating process should be included under the roles and responsibilities section of the AUP.

=====Video Report=====
'''This video report provides a review of social networking and Web 2.0 usage in the classroom.'''
&lt;br&gt;
By R. Wilensky

There are all sorts of networks in a school environment including computer networks, informal social networks and now online social networks.

* An online social network consists of a network of individuals (often called “friends”) who are linked in some way.
* An online social network makes use of Web 2.0 technologies to connect these friends in a useful and meaningful way
* An online social network and its associated Web 2.0 tools can greatly enhance learning in the classroom if utilized appropriately

The utilization of social networks and Web 2.0 tools should be looked at in various classrooms and settings. This video report uses highlights three different perspectives.

* Jen works for an education non-profit that services many schools in the New York City school district. Her job is to integrate technology into the curriculum at many different schools in the district.
* Liz is Instructional Technology Specialist and Director of 21st Century Learning outside of Boston, MA and she discusses technology integration at several schools in which she has worked. 
* Linda is a teacher in a 5th grade classroom on Long Island, New York known as “North London” collaborative. She, along with a co-teacher, are utilizing technology in innovative ways to enhance learning.

You can have up to 100 questions with question feedback or 200 questions without question feedback in a quiz.  Having too many questions in a quiz will slow down the performance and may cause unexpected problems with the quiz.

If you need more questions - a good idea is to split the quiz into parts of around 100 questions each and link each part automatically by adding a URL to the [[../../Quiz Options/Web Settings|After Quiz]] option in '''Quiz Options - Web Settings'''.  You can either do this invisibly or you can add some explanation and give the quiz taker the opportunity to have a comfort break - by adding some text into [[../../Quiz Options/Other Labels|Finished Quiz Screen Text]] in '''Quiz Options - Other Labels'''.

This problem can also be overcome using Pages. You can have up to 200 pages in a quiz and those pages can have multiple questions per page. We don't recommend a quiz that large though! However you'll find for a 100 question quiz, it is usually better to have a quiz of 20 pages with 5 questions each for performance reasons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:N64-gnu-app.png|250px|thumb|right|The error handling routine of an application coded from the ground up in C]]The N64 is by no means resource limited, so writing software for it in C is perfectly reasonable. One thing you must keep in mind, though: coding for the N64 requires extensive knowledge of both C and [[MIPS Assembly|MIPS R4K assembly]]. However, assembly will only have to be used in small routines that initialize the N64 (or handle exceptions). You also have to be familiar with the GNU toolchain (binutils and gcc namely).

This tutorial is, obviously, for a UNIX environment. If you're lazy, there's a link to an automated build script at the bottom of the page!

== Initial Steps ==
The version of GCC this document will be covering is a few years old, and the newer compilers are unable to compile it for whatever reason. To combat this, grab a GCC compatibility compiler (3.x should do; they're usually in the repos). I'll be using GCC 3.2.3 ('gcc32') for my examples.

Choose a directory that you want the compiled binaries and set this to $DIR. For example,
&lt;pre&gt;export DIR=`pwd`/root&lt;/pre&gt;
Next, set $GCC to the compiler you are going to use (the compatability one). For example,
&lt;pre&gt;export GCC=gcc32&lt;/pre&gt;

== Building binutils ==
Download the appropriate version (2.16 - link in the links section), extract, change into that directory and run the following commands:
&lt;pre&gt;./configure --target=mips64 --prefix=$DIR --program-prefix=mips64- --with-cpu=mip64vr4300
make CC=$GCC
make install&lt;/pre&gt;
Hopefully everything went well, and now you'll have a binutils package targeting MIPS.

== Compiling GCC ==
GCC needs to use some of the binaries that you compiled above, so do the following:
&lt;pre&gt;export PATH=$PATH:$DIR/bin&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make GCC be able to find them.

As with binutils, download the appropriate version (3.3 - link in the links section), extract, change into the created directory, and run the following commands:
&lt;pre&gt;./configure --target=mips64 --prefix=$DIR --program-prefix=mips64- --with-cpu=mip64vr4300 -with-languages=c --disable-threads
make CC=$GCC
make install&lt;/pre&gt;

== Coding examples ==
While coding C for the N64 is no different than any other platform (except that you don't have any libraries at your disposal), you may, at times, have to write to memory mapped registers. The following example (which utilizes DMA) demonstrates this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **
** N64 DMA                         **
** ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ */

typedef struct
{
	/* Pointers to data */
	void *ramp;
	void *romp;
	
	/* Filesizes (8-byte aligned) */
	u32 size_ramrom; /* RAM -&gt; ROM */
	u32 size_romram; /* RAM &lt;- ROM */
	
	/* Status register */
	u32 status;
} DMA_REG;

/* DMA status flags */
enum
{
	DMA_BUSY  = 0x00000001,
	DMA_ERROR = 0x00000008
};

/* DMA registers ptr */
static volatile DMA_REG * dmaregs = (DMA_REG*)0xA4600000;

/* Copy data from ROM to RAM */
int dma_write_ram ( void *ram_ptr, void *rom_ptr, u32 length )
{
	/* Check that DMA is not busy already */
	while( dmaregs-&gt;status &amp; DMA_BUSY );
	
	/* Write addresses */
	dmaregs-&gt;ramp = (u32)ram_ptr &amp; 0x00FFFFFF; /* ram pointer */
	dmaregs-&gt;romp = (u32)rom_ptr &amp; 0x1FFFFFFF; /* rom pointer */
	
	/* Write size */
	dmaregs-&gt;size_romram = length - 1;
	
	/* Wait for transfer to finish */
	while( dmaregs-&gt;status &amp; DMA_BUSY );
	
	/* Return size written */
	return length &amp; 0xFFFFFFF8;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

You may also have to use inline assembly a fair bit. The function below sets a breakpoint on a region of memory:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
enum
{
        BREAKPOINT_READ  = 1,
        BREAKPOINT_WRITE = 2
};

/* Set breakpoint */
void bp_set ( u32 addr, u8 flags )
{
        addr &amp;= 0x3FFFF8; /* assuming lower 4MB, also doubleword */
        flags &amp;= 0x03; /* only lower two bits */
        addr |= flags;

        asm(&quot;mtc0 %0, $18\n&quot; /* WatchLo */
        &quot;mtc0 $zero, $19\n&quot; /* WatchHi */
        ::&quot;r&quot;(addr));
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Alas, today that Sourceforge URL is giving me a 404 error.

[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]]'''Solution:'''&lt;br&gt;
Two different methods need to be used here to compute earthwork volumes along the five strips.  The average end area method can be used for non-zero sections.  The pyramid method needs to be used for areas with zero ends.

For 0+00 to 0+50, use average end area:

&lt;math&gt;Fill = \frac{{60+50}}{{2}}(50) = 2750\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For 0+50 to 0+75, use average end area:

&lt;math&gt;Fill = \frac{{50+25}}{{2}}(25) = 937.5\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For 0+75 to 1+00, use the average end area method for the fill section and the pyramid method for the cut section:

&lt;math&gt;Fill = \frac{{25+5}}{{2}}(25) = 375\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Cut = \frac{{10(25)}}{{3}} = 83.3\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For 1+00 to 1+15, use the pyramid method for the fill section and the average end area method for the cut section:

&lt;math&gt;Fill = \frac{{5(15)}}{{3}} = 25\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Cut = \frac{{10 + 15}}{{2}}(15) = 187.5\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For 1+15 to 1+50, use the average end area method:

&lt;math&gt;Cut = \frac{{15 + 30}}{{2}}(35) = 787.5\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The sums of both cut and fill can be found:

* Fill = 4087.5 cubic-meters
* Cut = 1058.3 cubic-meters

Thus, 3029.2 cubic-meters of dirt are needed to meet the earthwork requirement for this project.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #02D4EE; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]]'''Solution:'''&lt;br&gt;
With the statements in the problem, we know:
* Green Time = 30 seconds
* Red Time = 70 seconds
* Cycle Length = 100 seconds
* Arrival Rate = 500 veh/hr (0.138 veh/sec)
* Departure Rate = 3000 veh/hr (0.833 veh/sec)

Traffic intensity, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, is the first value to calculate.

&lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{{\lambda}}{{\mu}} = \frac{{500}}{{3000}} = 0.167\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Time to queue clearance after the start of effective green: 

&lt;math&gt; t_c {\rm{ }} = {\rm{ }}\frac{{\rho r}}{{1 - \rho }} = \frac{{0.167(70)}}{{1 - 0.167}} = 14.03\ s \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Proportion of the cycle with a queue:

&lt;math&gt; P_q {\rm{  }} = {\rm{ }}\frac{{r{\rm{ }} + {\rm{ }}t_c }}{C}{\rm{ }} = {\rm{ }}\frac{{70{\rm{ }} + {\rm{ }}14.03 }}{100}{\rm{ }} = 0.84\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Proportion of vehicles stopped:

&lt;math&gt; P_s  = \frac{{\lambda \left( {r + t_C } \right)}}{{\lambda \left( {r + g} \right)}} = \frac{{0.138 \left( {70 + 14.03 } \right)}}{{0.138 \left( {70 + 30} \right)}} = 0.84 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Maximum number of vehicles in the queue:

&lt;math&gt;Q_{\max } {\rm{ }} = {\rm{ }}\lambda r = {\rm{ }}0.138(70) = 9.66 \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

Total vehicle delay per cycle:

&lt;math&gt; D_t {\rm{  }} = {\rm{ }}\frac{{\lambda r^2 }}{{2\left( {1 - \rho } \right)}}{\rm{ }} = {\rm{ }}\frac{{0.138(70^2) }}{{2\left( {1 - 0.167 } \right)}}{\rm{ }} = 406\ veh-s \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Average delay per vehicle:

&lt;math&gt; d_{avg} {\rm{ }} = \frac{{r^2 }}{{2C\left( {1 - \rho } \right)}} = \frac{{(70)^2 }}{{2(100)\left( {1 - 0.167} \right)}} = 29.41\ s\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Maximum delay of any vehicle:

&lt;math&gt; d_{\max } {\rm{ }} = {\rm{ }}r = {\rm{ }} 70\ s \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the solution can be determined:

* Proportion of the cycle with a queue = 0.84
* Maximum number of vehicles in the queue = 9.66
* Total Delay = 406 veh-sec
* Average Delay = 29.41 sec
* Maximum Delay = 70 sec
&lt;/div&gt;

 Bridge Picture[[http://www.humberbridge.co.uk/resources/humber_bridge_shot1.jpg]]

'''Introduction'''

Your career progression will most likely be determined by you.  So to begin, think about your professional, educational and extracurricular backgrounds in terms of how they relate to a career education technology.  The purpose of this exercise is to understand what you have to offer and where you are coming from.  This is needed to understand where you can go, in terms of your career.  

Many technologists, and other professionals, go through their entire careers with little to no active ownership of their career progression.  They do so at their own peril.  Pity the person who does not know his or her professional value and how to market that value in a ever-changing job market.  The education technologist, sitting in the seemingly secure world of education, should not be lulled into believing that just because she may be to only one in their school performing the critical tasks of technology management, she is in a secure position with little possibility of loses her job.  It must be remembered that the tight budgets that education technologists suffer under can sometimes lead to loss of funding for their own positions.  Unemployment may only be one rejected school budget vote away.

1. Taking charge of your career is important because:
A: No job is secure
B: I may want different challenges
C: Who knows what will happen in the future
D: School budgets are often not approved


'''Charting Your Course'''

So now think about these next questions, what is next for you? and what career moves are you contemplating? E.g., “ I am working towards becoming a Microsoft Certified Network Administrator.”  Also what parts of technology and education technology, in particular, interest you?  It is not only important to answer these questions, but also important to ask them.  By asking them, you start to think about yourself as not someone who is just in a current position into perpetuity, but rather as someone who is at a career stop on the track that could possibly lead to other opportunities.  This type of thinking may rid you of the ignorant bliss of believing that you are safe in your position until retirement, but you gain the comfort that comes with taking charge of your career and having a 'plan B' in the event that you are forced to find another job.

So now that you been ‘primed’ for thinking about your career and beginning to take ownership of it, it is important to understand who you are and what you bring to the ‘table’.  In essence, it will help us to understand what are your marketable skills and what type of situation you should be look for.  Often professionals engage in a ‘reactive’ job search.  This entails a lot of reacting the job market and the situations that they find themselves in.  They wait for jobs to come to them.  While in interviews, they wait to be asked questions and when offered a job they accept whatever terms are put forth by the potential employer.  We want to shift your thinking to one of ‘proactively’ controlling your career, so that you are taking charge of your career and have as much control over your career as possible.  

2.  The difference between a proactive and reactive stance on your career is:
A: Proactive is about sitting around and reactive is about taking charge
B: Proactive is about taking charge and reactive is about sitting around
C. Proactive makes you feel like you don’t have control, while reactive does
D: Reactive is results in a great new job more than proactive


'''Assessment'''

This begins with assessment.  There are four main areas of assessment: skills, style, values and interests.  By determining yours, you will be able to chart your career direction better and evaluate potential future jobs more comprehensively.  Let’s begin with skills; these are the things that you do on the job that add value.  In short, they are the reason that you are needed in your job in the first place.  The computer languages that you know and apply such as, C, C++, Java, and Visual Basic fall into this category.  In looking at your skills, it is important to distinguish between all your skills and those that can directly be applied to future job opportunities.  These skills are termed, ‘transferable skills’.  An example of a transferable skill could be your ability to build comprehensive networking under tight budget constraints.  This skill is one that other educational institutions would surely be interested in and could be a main reason why they would hire you.  While skills are usually hard and fast and easily identifiable, style is more nebulous.  By style, we are referring to your personality style—how you act, especially how you act in the work environment.   Using personality preference measures such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (a light version can be found at [http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes1.htm]), and working with a certified professional to interpret and discuss the results, you can understand your personality and what type of work environments, potential bosses and co-workers you would work best in.  This can be invaluable as you seek out different employment opportunities and save you from taking a position that looked great in terms of skills need, but was lacking in style consistency for your personality preferences.  Next, we should examine your values ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_](personal_and_cultural).   Your values are a set of beliefs that guide your life and your interpretation of the world.  Obviously, not understanding your values, and how they match up with certain job opportunities, could lead to you working in environs where there is a mismatched fit and could lead to poor performance.  For instance, if you believe in a healthy lifestyle and clean air, it would not be the best fit for you to work in a tobacco company.  While values seem obvious to us, they need to be assessed and compiled in a deliberate manner in order to make you cognizant of them and apply them to the career development process.  Lastly, we need to define your interests in order to seek out the optimal job fit.  Your interests are the areas of work and non-work that pique your curiosity, hold your attention and fill you with energy and vitality.  By understanding what these interests are, we can seek to maximize them in our search for your next job.  By doing so, we can increase the likelihood that you are engaged and happy in your next position.

3.  The four main areas of assessment are:
A: Skills, ability, experience and desire
B: Ability, skills, tasks, computer languages
C: Who you know, where you are from, how much you like your job, what is next for you
D: Skills, style, values and interests


'''Establish Preliminary Goals'''

So now that you have standardized who you are personally and professionally, it is time to turn our attention to establishing preliminary goals.  This is done most effectively by building a developmental action plan to ensure job pathing, goal setting and next steps.  It is said that by writing things down, they are 80% more likely to occur.  The idea is not that things magically happen when you write them down, but rather by doing so you are forming a plan and based on that plan you are more likely to pursue coordinated action.  This plan can be created by the bottom up or top down, but for the sake of consistency let us go through a top down plan.  It starts by using your assessment results to help determine what job positions you would like to achieve.  For example, if you are a network administrator in your local elementary school, someone who is a ‘jack of all trades,’ you may be seeking out the ultimate goal of being the head of IT for the entire school district.  With that goal in mind, we can now work backwards to reverse engineer the job paths to get there.  Job paths, as one might guess, are the ways in which you move in your career to achieve your job goals.  There are often numerous paths that can take you to the same job goal.  In our example, the elementary school network administrator can take at least two general paths to achieve her goal of becoming head of all IT.  The first would be to move into progressively larger generalist roles where she still is a ‘jack of all trades,” but the scope of her responsibility gets larger and larger until she is a place where she has amassed enough experiences to be a viable candidate for the head of IT position.  The second general path would be for her to become a specialist.  In this path she would seek out different positions in order to collect all the pieces of the puzzle in order to become a viable candidate for the top spot.  In essence, she would be creating her own rotational program.  Her roles might be made up of taking stints as a systems administrator, programmer, security specialist and IT strategist.  Now that we have the main goals set and the job paths laid out, we can turn our attention towards next steps.  This is how we will get there and it entails understanding and taking action around the job search skills of networking, and resume writing. 

4. What are the two distinct paths to Head of IT, as cited in the example?
A: There is only one path
B: Generalist and specialist
C: Systems and programming
D: Politics and networking



'''Networking of a Different Kind'''

As an IT professional, you have a leg up on others in terms of understanding the concept of networking.  By networking, I mean the human equivalent of computer networks.  The initial goal of this type of networking build out is to create a seamless and ever-growing group of connected individuals who can assist you in progressing in your career.  Remember that we now have our assessment and plan in hand, so it is time to put them into action by developing connections to your next opportunities.  Your human professional networking is probably larger and will be of more assistance than you can imagine.  People consistently underrate the power of working with those they already know to achieve their goals.  So with that in mind, let us take a look at the network that is sitting right in front of your face, ready to help you get to where you want to go.  In a spreadsheet or piece of paper, write out all of the people that you know, starting with those in the IT profession, continuing with other professionals that you know and ending with friends, family and non-professionals.  Next to this list, make another column in which you write what each individual could help you with in terms of your job progression.  Some common entries could be: “information, further people to network with, possible job opportunities-now or in the future.”  Now form a third column and in it write what you would is the ultimate goal of networking with each person.  For some it will be information that leads to me being more informed in interviews and for others it may be a certain type of job.  These ultimate goals will help you to focus as you meet with these people to discuss your job progression.  People are the most power way to get to you next position with 60-80% of people who get new positions reporting that networking was the way that they did it  [http://books.google.com/books?id=KqyVZSZI6RQC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=percentage+of+people+who+find+jobs+through+networking&amp;source=web&amp;ots=xl3zLrK1Y6&amp;sig=abcEaARWXnwtAYVI9kKBU5ifTLs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result].

5. In terms of networking with people, individuals often:
A: Think that they don’t have a network
B: Believe that they have a robust network
C: Think that they don’t have a robust network, when often they do
D: Think that they have a robust network, when often they don’t


'''Resume Writing'''

Onto the dreaded resume and the painful resume creation process.  The good news is that resume are not nearly as important as common wisdom suggests and not nearly as important as networking.  The bad new is that you still need one, so to make the process as painless as possible, use a resume template from a site like www.Monster.com/Resume-Templates  to see the proper format to follow.  Then work with a career professional or a trusted colleague to craft the document.  Working with others really helps you to bring out your best skills and accomplishment in the resume.  That other person can act as a mirror to reflect your experiences back to you ensure your resume is as good as it can be.  Another key point is to treat the resume as a marketing document, it is not intended to be all things to all people, so create an all-inclusive master resume from which you create customized versions to use for certain positions.  Finally, once you have created a resume, put it away and go back to networking.  Only bring it out after you have made a personal connection with people, thus ensuring that it is you and not your resume that is making the connection.  Always remember that is people who get hired, not resumes.

6. Resumes should:
A: Be your be all to end all document
B: Seen as a marketing tool
C: Put away once completed
D: Choices B &amp; C


'''Conclusion'''

By taking a deliberate approach to your career; by focusing on up front exploration and assessment and matching it up with the creation of multi-pathed plan with specific goals, you are insuring the highest likelihood of career satisfaction and success, on your terms.  Instead of being reactive and letting your career happen to you, you can take charge and make your career happen for you.

7. Networking only involves computers? (T/F)
8. Resume writing is the most important part of career progression? (T/F)
9. Assessment consists of 3 main areas? (T/F)
10. Proactive is better than reactive? (T/F)

Finally we find ourselves prepared with all the tools to read a complete Sumerian sentence. I'm going to show you the complete sentence right away, then we'll analyze it just like we've analyzed noun phrases and verb phrases in the previous lessons.

== The Sentence ==

And now, here is your first Sumerian sentence! You can use the hovertext to explore each piece of the sentence.

This sentence is real Sumerian. It's from a literary piece called &quot;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.1.1.4&amp;display=Crit&amp;charenc=gcirc# Enki's journey to Nibru]&quot;, and can be referenced in the [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/ ETCSL] as 1.1.4.13 (in other words, line thirteen of the linked text, which is numbered 1.1.4).

 '''{{H:title|Eridug, a city in ancient Sumer|Eridug}}.{{H:title|.a, the locative case marker|a}} {{H:title|house, temple|e}} {{H:title|riverbank|gu}}.{{H:title|.a, the locative case marker|a}} {{H:title|bi., the locative verbal cross-reference|bi}}.{{H:title|.n., the absolutive verbal cross-reference|n}}.{{H:title|to build|du}}'''

We have already broken the sentence into words, which is something you'll have to do on your own when you read from a tablet, but for right now, let's see what we can figure out about this sentence.

== Concepts ==

As we analyze this sentence, you'll notice that we take each phrase, find its base, and then examine the particles affixed to the base. This is how you'll really analyze Sumerian when you're at a museum or online at the [http://www-etcsl.orient.ox.ac.uk/ ETCSL]. It's a very methodical approach, and can often resolve any ambiguities that arise from the context. First, let's make sure we know our base words!

== Vocabulary ==

* '''Eridug''' = ''Eridug'', the name of a city in ancient Sumer
* '''e''' = ''house, temple''
* '''gu''' = ''riverbank''
* '''du''' = ''to build''

== Analysis ==

Let's take a look at each separate phrase. We note that from the vocabulary that the first three phrases must be noun phrases, and the last phrase is a verb phrase. Let's examine them!

=== '''Eridug.a''' ===

From the vocabulary, we immediately notice the name '''Eridug''' here. Now, this is going to be the base of our noun phrase. So what's the other piece here? As it turns out, Sumerian used '''.a''' to mean a lot of different things, so we have to be careful. One of the uses of '''.a''' is as the locative particle. The locative case is used, as the name suggests, to locate the action in a sentence. In this case, our base noun is ''Eridug'', so it seems quite likely that the '''.a''' is, in fact, the locative marker. So we read '''Eridug.a''' as ''in Eridug'', or possibly ''at Eridug'' (context will help you decide which reading is better).

=== '''e''' ===

Our vocabulary lists this little word as meaning ''house'', or in some contexts, ''temple''. But, unlike the other noun phrases in this sentence, this one seems to have no case marker! So how do we know what case to put this noun phrase?

Well, linguists like to tell us that every single noun phrase in a sentence needs to be marked for some case or other, and when things show up with no markers, they like to put a &quot;null&quot; marker in their analysis. So instead of just '''e''', our analysis will look like '''e.Ø'''. The mark that looks like a zero there just means we have a null marking.

Now, in Sumerian, the null marking means that the noun is in the absolutive case. You're probably not familiar with this case, as it doesn't crop up in English. For now, just think of it like our direct object. In other words, the null marking marks whatever the action is happening to.

=== '''gu.a''' ===

We know from above that '''gu''' means ''riverbank'', so all we have to do now is figure out the '''.a''' particle. Just as in the first noun phrase, it seems likely that this '''.a''' is the locative particle, locating our action. So we can read this phrase as ''at the riverbank''.

=== '''bi.n.du''' ===

We already know that '''du''' means ''to build'', so let's analyze the other pieces in this verb phrase. First, we have the '''.n''' in the middle. This is a little particle letting us know that the agent of the action was third-person singular. As Sumerian does not distinguish biological gender, let's just use masculine for this translation. That gives us '''.n.du''' meaning ''he builds''. Now we are left with the '''bi.''' particle.

Sumerian, as is typical of agglutinating languages, likes to &quot;cross-reference&quot; the cases of all noun phrases in a sentence with markers in the verb. In other words, for every noun phrase that has a case marker, there will be a little marker in our verb as well. So if you had a sentence with a noun phrase in the dative case and one in the comitative case, you would see a matching dative marker and a matching comitative marker in the verb.

In our example sentence, we only see noun phrases in the locative case. That's what this little '''bi.''' particle does - it cross-references the locative case. In particular, it cross-references locative phrases which have ''non-human'' bases. Here, we're talking about a riverbank and the city of Eridug, both inanimate things, so we use the inanimate cross-reference, '''bi.'''.

Finally, Sumerian allows us to cross-reference the ''patient'' of an action (think of it like the object of the sentence). This cross-reference is usually a particle attached at the end of the phrase, or suffixed after the verbal root. But we look here, and see nothing after our verb root, '''du'''. What does this mean? Well, just like we saw the absolutive case marker '''.Ø''' marking the '''e''' just above on a noun, the third-person singular patient case is marked with '''.Ø''' on a verb. So we would really analyze our verb as '''bi.n.du.Ø'''.

Got all that? So in order, we would analyze our verb as:

 '''bi.n.du.Ø''' = ''inanimate-locative-cross-reference.3rd-sg-animate-agent.BUILD.3rd-sg-inanimate-patient''

Whew! That's a lot to take in, but I think you get the idea. Each particle in our verb here cross-references a noun phrase in our sentence. (The actual subject of the sentence isn't explicitly written here, but we just translate it as &quot;he&quot;).

== Putting it all together ==

Now that we've analyzed all four pieces of this sentence, let's see what we have! The first phrase translated to &quot;at Eridug&quot;, the second to &quot;the house&quot;, the third to &quot;by the riverbank&quot;, and the last to &quot;he built&quot;. So now we can translate the entire sentence:

 '''Eridug.a e gu.a bi.n.du'''

Analyzed phrase by phrase:

 ''at Eridug, the house, by the riverbank, he built''

And translated:

 ''At Eridug, he built the house by the riverbank''

The important thing to remember here is that once you've broken your sentence up into words (or more properly, phrases), then it's just a simple process of analysis to determine the meaning of each piece, then adding the meanings back together to get your final translation.

Pretty fun, huh? You just read your first sentence in Sumerian!

== Quick Quiz ==

Now, let's try one yourself! I'll give you a sentence and the vocabulary for the base words, then see if you can figure out what each phrase means, and put it all together to see what the sentence means.

 '''{{H:title|Nanna, a Sumerian deity|Nanna}}.{{H:title|.ir, the dative case marker|r}} {{H:title|wall|bad}} {{H:title|mu., the ventive verbal prefix|mu}}.{{H:title|.na., the dative case cross-reference|na}}.{{H:title|.n., 3rd sg animate agent|n}}.{{H:title|to build|du}}'''

=== Quiz vocabulary ===

* '''Nanna''' = ''Nanna'', a Sumerian deity
* '''bad''' = ''wall''
* '''.ir''' = ''dative case marker''
* '''mu.''' = ''ventive verbal marker''
* '''.na.''' = ''dative case verbal cross-reference''

=== Quiz hints ===

You can use the hovertext over any piece of the example sentence to get more information on that particular particle or word.

If you're wondering what the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventive ventive] mode is, it means that the action of the verb is performed in the direction of the speaker. This can be meant concretely or abstractly. In this case, with the verb '''du''' = ''to build'', it's likely that the meaning is a little more abstract. The speaker perhaps became the owner of the built object, or something like that.

If you're wondering what the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dative_case dative] case is, it marks a noun phrase as being the beneficiary of the action. In this case, it's attached to a deity, '''Nanna''', so it's likely that whatever action was being done, it was being done ''for Nanna''.

[[File:srwc.jpg|center|]]


== Introduction ==
Over 20 years ago a study showed that teachers did not view computers as a threat to their jobs. They believed that computers should be used in all subject areas and that teaching computer literacy is the responsibility of teachers on all grade levels. However, in that study it also showed that 50% of teachers indicated a preference for traditional teaching methods; the other half felt that students enjoy using computers and should have more access to them and believed that students learn faster on computers. Today, computers assist in the teaching/learning process.  When teachers are provided with  opportunities to acquire appropriate computer skills, they gain access to an unfathomable amount of information. However, unless teachers  view computers as an opportunity, it is unlikely that they will  use technology constructively, to help facilitate classroom work and achieve educational goals. But how can this be done without isolating the traditionalist teachers versus the technology driven teachers?  Many factors are involved and covered in this topic. The position of Technology Coordinator at a school is presumed in this discussion.
== The Job of the Technology Coordinator ==
Technology coordinators in general work with principals, department heads, teachers, and others who will help implement the district/school technology plan. They establish evaluation guidelines so that data from different schools can be compared and can be used as part of the evaluation of district progress. They develop, implement, and periodically evaluate technology instruction and training. This assists them in developing resources in every discipline to provide leadership in working to accomplish instructional technology plans. They help teachers and school administrators become functionally computer-literate and learn their roles in accomplishing the technology plans.
In addition they assist the school board/district in developing and implementing plans for the acquisition and maintenance of hardware and software. This involves going out for bids for necessary equipment,etc. These acquisitions accommodate the needs of each of the schools in the district consider current use and availability of equipment to determine location of equipment and how it will provide a more efficient use of technology. The technology coordinator is also responsible for maintenance which includes routine preventive maintenance as well as more general repair and replacement. They are responsible to train teachers to at least do a minimal level of maintenance. Technology coordinators help develop and implement procedures for the evaluation of software, hardware, and course ware, and for the sharing of the results of those evaluations. They are involved in district research projects to evaluate instructional use of computers and tie in with national or state organizations that are doing software evaluation.
Technology coordinators, with all other school employees, work to improve the overall quality of education received by students. They must be sensitive to equity issues and work to resolve inequities, and be an educational &quot;change agent.&quot; To accomplish this they must participate in the development of curricular standards and benchmarks to encourage appropriate use of technology; work with teachers and peers to develop lesson plans and activities involving use of technology. Technology coordinators inform teachers of new technologies, both hardware and software, which may assist in developing content specific materials, and must be aware of  trends in the field of technology in education.
So what does a district/school look for in a technology coordinator? A broad general education and dedication to lifelong learning. Overall intelligence and perseverance; a strong work ethic; high ethical standards; self confidence; good time-management skills; budgeting and other fiscal skills.  Appropriate skills for teaching school children as well as educators and other adults, are required as is knowledge of curriculum, curriculum development, and school reform and knowledge of testing and assessment.
Technical coordinators must also have knowledge in the fields of computer science, computer education, and the broad range of technologies used in hypermedia environments.
A technology coordinator has many responsibilities, but ultimately, the job is measured by how effectively teachers use technology in the classroom.  So, communication and understanding the school's attitudes is as important as anything. According to Keengwe, et al (2008):
:: ...It is usually the factors that are personal and deeply ingrained, such as teachers’ beliefs about the instruction process ... and the value of computing in education ... that play a big role in the way teachers generally integrate educational technology tools into instruction.
Bill Mackenty, an instructional designer for Hunter College in New York City, agrees that managing personal relationships is central to this role.  He blogs about studying the field of “emotional intelligence” in order to have effective communications with different groups of educators.
== Definition of Educational Technology ==
From Wikipedia: 
::Educational technology is most simply and comfortably defined as an array of tools that might prove helpful in advancing student learning. Educational Technology relies on a broad definition of the word &quot;technology&quot;. Technology can refer to material objects of use to humanity, such as machines or hardware, but it can also encompass broader themes, including systems, methods of organization, and techniques. Some modern tools include but are not limited to overhead projectors, laptop computers, and calculators. Newer tools such as &quot;smartphones&quot; and games (both online and offline) are beginning to draw serious attention for their learning potential. 
It is important to remember that &quot;technology&quot; and &quot;computers&quot; are not synonyms.  It is also helpful to discuss this concept with teachers—especially those who are reluctant to use new technology.  There really is not a classroom in this country that uses no technology at all (even pencils and blackboards are types of &quot;technology.&quot;)
== Context of School ==
School Administrators in charge of technological resources should work to foster an open and healthy climate that allows teacher and staff to have supportive communication to share ideas about the use of computers in the classroom setting. Many schools have technical coordinators who for the most part purchase or utilize the software approved by the school administration. Teachers are often forced to learn and implement a curriculum in which they had little or no input, and often do not have the opportunity to initiate new practices. Because their input is not given, potential for improvement with current technical resources does not occur.
Often times teachers and administrators do not have enough time or do not have time set aside to collaborate on projects or resources that may be beneficial to their peers or the school system in general. Teacher are a times not allowed to engage in activities that would bring new knowledge for changes in computer education because they can only utilize the computers within the context of the curriculum already designed.
Professional development time and resources are as important as open communication and time for collaboration on and implementation of technological projects.  Peer-to-peer training is perfectly acceptable, and even desirable in many cases, but teachers should not be left to train themselves on their own time.
Schools that do not take teacher input into account, do not provide time for experimenting and collaborating, and that don't provide adequate training will, inevitably, suffer from bad relationships between the teaching faculty and the technology staff.  An “us versus them” attitude is counterproductive and difficult to overcome.
== Communication Needs ==
Technology coordinators and administrators should organize monthly meetings with teachers for the purposes of informing teachers about upcoming or future changes to software or technical resources, changes to procedures and practices, etc. These monthly meetings will allow the teachers to express and share their ideas on the current technology they are using, solve problems and create an ongoing communication network. These meetings can lead to assessments. These assessments can provide evidence to technology coordinators essentially about what works or is working and what is not. If this type of communication is lacking in the school, it fosters a sense of mistrust and animosity between teachers and use of advanced and improved technical resources. Not as a detriment to their students, but as a passive aggressive behavior to show their displeasure with the &quot;authoritarian&quot; methods of introducing technology to their learning environment.
Teacher and technology administrators need to have a collaborative setting to discuss and share instructional ideas and materials. Technology leaders can show initiative and willingness to accept or at least listen to new ideas and offer an &quot;opening&quot; to assist with the problem solving in relation to using technology at schools. This will in turn empower the teachers to seek help on these issues from students,parents and others to identify the best solutions.
== Goals ==
Barth (1990) stated that a good school is a place in which everyone is teaching and everyone is learning simultaneously under that same roof. Taking this a step further regarding staff interaction with technology resources, schools should involve the teachers to take advantage of suggestions and &quot;untapped&quot; knowledge available to them without hiring consultants to explain to teachers what they may already know regarding what resources are best for their setting.  Relying on teachers for providing knowledge and other input to technology use at the school has the added benefit of making it easier for faculty “buy-in” of new technologies and technological projects.  Goals for technology use and sharing of technological ideas at a school can be formed around this concept, and then the goals can be used to formalize the structure of the relationship between the technology staff and the rest of the faculty.  Generic goals, that can be applied to almost any school:
#Teachers workload and time constraints will be respected.
#Teachers'  methods and styles will be considered when implementing new technologies.
#Teachers' level of understanding about educational technology will improve each year.
#Teachers will be used for peer-to-peer training of “standard” or preexisting technologies.
#“Best Practices” will be promulgated through the faculty.
#Teachers will have a major role in deciding the role of technology in their classrooms.
#The best instructional techniques should be used in the classroom—whether or not they involve technology.
It is not a trivial task to reach theses goals.  The technology coordinator must have access to administration as well as faculty, and good communication with both. The relationship between teaching faculty and the technology staff must be formalized, or at least analyzed and understood by the coordinator.  
Perhaps the most important role that the technology coordinator has, with respect to relationships with the faculty, is as a teacher.  Given a school environment, this would seem to be obvious, but  it is important to keep in mind pedagogical concepts.  
Dewey (1902) said: “The problem of direction is thus the problem of selecting appropriate stimuli for instincts and impulses which it is desired to employ in the gaining of new experience.”  So, the technology coordinator should use the existing knowledge and skills of the faculty to build upon and advance the use of educational technology at the school.
Technology coordinators should keep in mind the last goal listed above.  The most effective teaching does not have to involve technology.  In fact, one could argue that an education provided through purely “high-tech” means would be no better, and possibly worse, than one provided with zero use of technology. 
== Formalized Structure ==
In order for staff relations to be effective where technological resources are concerned technology coordinators should:
#Create  teams with teachers who will serve as models for technology use,&quot;train- the-trainer” experts, and will generally act as technology peer leaders.  Besides these three explicit roles, probably the most important reason for a faculty tech team is to create “buy-in” among teachers, and minimize the “us-versus-them” attitude that can subvert implementation of technology in a school. The structure of a “tech team” will vary from school to school, as determined by these factors:
##Extent of technology use at the school
###Ratio of computers to students
####As this ratio increases, so does the number of teachers required, as does the optimal number of levels of organization.  At a school with a one-to one laptop program, for instance, a large, multi-level teacher tech  team will likely be required. Each department might supply one (or more) “senior” team members, who mentor and supervise the “junior” members.  The junior members will be more numerous, and will be the primary “work force” that can be put to use by the technology coordinator and technology staff.
####A model incorporating senior and junior members allows for more efficient management of a relatively large tech team.  The technology coordinator can spend most planning time with the senior members, who, in turn, meet with their respective junior members to carry out the task at hand.
####Another advantage of a multi-level approach is that a peer-to-peer training structure is “built in.” The senior members can be expected to train the junior members.  This can also lead to a natural rotation of tech team members.  Junior members can be promoted to Senior members after a standard amount of time—or perhaps after meeting some minimum requirements.  Senior members would then be relieved of their duties; or move on to an even more senior role, if the faculty tech team has a need for this.
####As this model matures at a school, the team can “grow” in both directions.  Not only can senior faculty members be promoted to even more senior levels, but the team can grow at the “bottom” by adding students to the team.  The student tech-team can serve as peer leaders for students, and as classroom assistants to teachers.   Students will gain practical experience, and should be formally recognized by the school, with community service points if the school has this program, or, if incorporated into a class, with computer science credits.  Students' presence on the tech team also serves to increase the school community's “buy-in” to the technological programs at the school.
####If the ratio of computers to students is low, then a lower percentage of the faculty is needed for the support team, of course. However, if the team is set up with a multi-level structure in mind, even this structure is not immediately implemented, then future expansion of the program won't require a complete restructuring.
###Ratio of computers to teachers
####Just as the tech team's optimal size is proportional to the computer to student ratio, it is also affected, albeit less so, by the extent of computer use among the faculty.  A small team—perhaps a sub-portion of the tech team—should be designated as the mentors/trainers for new faculty for all schools. For schools with minimal technology use in the classrooms, this may be the entire extent of the tech team. Once again, though, even this “starter” tech team should be organized with the future in mind.
###Amount of “other” technology use at the school
####Projectors, interactive white boards, student response systems, and other technologies add to the burden on the technology coordinator, and can't be ignored when determining tech team responsibilities.  A natural way to help spread the workload is to include in the tech team positions for peer experts in the use of each technology that the school has.  Ideally, the library should be involved with managing the inventory of technology equipment for classroom use.
###Experience of faculty with respect to technology
####Little or no prior experience
#####A faculty without any significant experience in applying technology in the classroom obviously presents a challenge to a technology coordinator.  In an environment such as this, the ideal strategy is to introduce educational technology to a select group of teachers, and work intensely with them, slowly creating a core group of educational technology experts.  These experts can then serve as the core of the tech team described above.
#####While the optimal strategy may be to work slowly with small group of teachers in order to develop a strong tech team core that can be expanded, this is not always practical.  However, even when there are time pressures and rigid requirements imposed from “above,” the technology coordinator will benefit from attempts to build this model into the education technology structure of the school.  At worst, having a few teachers—even with no educational technology experience—to help organize and facilitate training, will not only ease the burden on the technology coordinator, but will, to some extent, start creating the “team” concept that will help to break down any “us versus them” attitudes.
####Experienced Faculty
#####As the educational technology experience of the faculty increases, the tech team can grow and become or approach the multi-level team “ideal.”
#####As the experience level of even the least-proficient faculty members reaches the point of competence, the structure of the tech team can remain the same, while the focus changes.  Goals and action items for the tech team should change in the following ways:
######Reduced focus on basic training, more on investigating creative uses of technology
######Reduced focus on learning to use current technological “tools,” more on discovering new technologies
######Increased focus on solving  problems that have impeded technology use in the classroom.
######The technology coordinator can become more of a “liaison” between the the classroom and the world of technology, and less of a technology “tutor.”
###Workload of the Faculty
####In the real world of schools, finding the time to meet every requirement and also do a good job preparing for and teaching classes is a consistent issue.  If the faculty believe that the technology coordinator is sensitive to this, there is more likely to be a better relationship between the teaching faculty and the technology staff.
####New projects and standards should be developed with the idea that, in the long run, they will lead to more efficient use of a teacher's time.  This isn't always possible, but a new policy should only increase the long-term effort of the teacher if the pedagogical benefits out weigh the increased time requirement. If a new requirement will truly require more of a teacher's time without increasing the educational outcome for students, it should be one that leads to a smaller time requirement in another aspect of the teacher's job.
####It may seem counter-intuitive, but the higher the overall workload on the faculty, the larger the optimal tech team will be.  A larger tech team means responsibilities can be more spread out.  The structure of the tech team, in this case, will likely involve a smaller relative number of senior-level members, but a larger number of junior-level members, so the responsibilities of each junior member is reduced.  Instead of working with their entire department grade level, a junior member of a team in this type of school may be responsible for working with just one other member of their department, for instance.
####At an extremely understaffed school, the technology coordinator will have to make some very difficult decisions.  Maybe a tech team cannot be created, and the technology coordinator must fill all of the roles.  This of course, means the breadth and depth of technology projects will be limited.  A costly solution that may be available because of  special technology funding for the district or school is to hire outside consultants to help with the technology coordinator's job.  However, a less-costly solution is to involve parents on a volunteer basis.  Often, there are technology experts in the family of school parents, who can provided knowledge and labor to school projects and initiatives.
#Set aside time to discuss instructional needs
##Consideration of instructional needs should be the highest priority for the technology coordinator and the tech team at all times!  In a general sense, “instructional needs” can be interpreted as the needs that support the primary purpose of the school, and so should be the top priority for any committee, team, or project at the school.
##More specifically, the technological instructional needs of the teachers—hardware, software, training, and support—should be the major focus of the tech team in at least three circumstances:
###At a technologically inexperienced school, or one with no history of faculty tech teams.
###Early in the school year, to address problems discovered only in the application of technology in the classrooms.
###Late in the school year, to plan for the next year's needs.
#Create time for staff to share new ideas and improvements in instruction
##“Best Practices” meetings should be held, where teaches can discuss and demonstrate techniques and tips for the best use of technology in the classroom, as well as help with avoiding troubles with technology.
##In order to use faculty time as efficiently as possible, the sharing of technological best practices doesn't have to be separated from discussions of best practices in general.   If the school has a structure that allows for teachers to share ideas in a formal way already, the technology coordinator should work to include technology in the existing discussions.
##Sharing of best practices should be encouraged—even informally.  The technology coordinator's job becomes more effective when there are many channels providing similar information.  Teachers are aware that their students learn best when material is presented in more than one way.  Teachers, when they learn, are students like anyone else!
##Request and act on feedback. 
###In addition to sharing “best practices,” a technology coordinator should also ensure teachers share stories about problems they have had with technology.
###Sharing of negative stories can lead to peer-developed solutions, or, at least help determine where major problems exist.  This will allow the technology coordinator to set his priorities for developing or discovering new educational technology, and, when the negative stories involve hardware or software problems, setting priorities for the “support” side of the job (or, even better, provide these priorities to the tech support staff!).-Teachers relating negative stories often provide for good “reeducation” opportunities.  The feedback may be negative because of a misunderstanding on the teacher's part, or the solution may be a simple one.  If this type of feedback is responded to immediately, the teachers involved will be more likely to remember the correct “answer.”

The structure detailed above will give staff the opportunity to design, prepare and evaluate instruction based on the technology resources that they have available and are required to use. Allow the teachers to demonstrate to their peers will reduce the training burden on the technology staff and lead to more creative use of technology in the classroom.
The stated goals support a positive relationship with between teachers, the school's technological experts and the software/instruction itself, by increasing the sharing of ideas and information, and by fostering regular communication and ongoing dialogue between and among teaching faculty and the technology staff. If these objectives are implemented teachers will reach a level of trust and cooperation needed to work effectively with the technology staff. This, then,  promotes a better understanding of faculty needs in the technology staff, who become more equipped to communicate with administrators who determine budgets and school- (or district-) wide priorities.  It also leads to a better understanding of limitations and &quot;why things are the way they are&quot; on the part of the teachers.
Teacher participation in decision-making has a positive correlation between increases in morale.  This leads to more  cooperation and  and effectiveness in the classroom.

== Human Resource Management Issues ==

Being a Technology and Networking Coordinator in a K-12 school is not an easy job.  Based on the website Technology Coordinator’s Handbook – A Website Dedicated to School-based Technology Professionals, “Technology coordinators are ultimately responsible for entire networks, hundreds of computers and printers, and a host of other assorted electronic devices. Besides keeping track of all the technology, a technology coordinator is also expected to conduct and maintain training and training schedules, attend technology meetings, help with grants and funding, introduce technology-integrated curriculum, fix and upgrade computers, install software, troubleshoot networks, etc., etc.”  (School-based Technology Coordinator’s Home Page, http://schools.pinellas.k12.fl.us/tchandbk/default.htm)

Besides tackling the challenges from technology projects and network trouble-shooting, the Technology and Networking Coordinator must manage and maintain good relationships with a wide range of staff, namely the teachers, principals, and administrative staff in order to successfully implement his or her technology initiatives.  Not only is the Technology and Network Coordinator required to be a change agent, he or she is also required to have the knowledge and the skill-set to influence the school staff to accept, adopt, and implement these technology changes.  However, most of the time, the Technology and Networking Coordinator will run into several road blocks in his or her relationship with the staff.  With the tremendous benefits and potential offered by technology, it might be puzzling for many Technology and Networking Coordinators to understand why do so many teachers and staff resist technology and even resist having a productive professional relationship with the Technology and Networking Coordinator.

This chapter will examine some of the challenges that a Technology and Networking Coordinator will face in his or her relationships with the teachers and staff, the causes for these strains in relationships, and suggestions to overcome these challenges.

== Staff Relations Challenge #1: Technology Resistance ==

Understand your co-workers: There are numerous ways the school staff may view the school Technology and Networking Coordinator.  Some teachers and staff welcome the introduction of technology into the classrooms and will view the Technology and Networking Coordinator as a resource and a go-to person for IT questions and issues.  However, there are also some staff who are fearful of technology and will be resistant to the technology proposals and projects implemented by the Technology and Networking Coordinator.  In the latter case, strains and challenges will occur in staff relations.  To influence someone, it is important to first understand how the other person thinks.  This section of the chapter will explore the potential mind sets of these staff.

Many of the teachers and staff who are fearful and resistant to technology are those who have been teaching and working for the school for many years, some of them might almost reach retirement. These staff did not grow up in the digital generation and are intimidated by the fast and ever-changing technological tools around them.  One of the common complaints voiced about technology is, “I am so busy with teaching and my job that I just don’t have the time to learn to how to use this new technology.”  This complaint is a common defense remark against change, they felt threatened by these new technologies because they have not learned much about them.  

Many staff may even fear for their job security with an introduction of a new technology.  There have been many observed cases when a new technology has been introduced to an organization or a company, the “old way” of doing things have been replaced.  Those who have introduced the new technology have been viewed as indispensable by the organization, while those who have been doing things the “old way” have either lost their power in the organization or are being replaced by younger and newer staff.  In Dr. Terrill’s book Technology on a Shoestring, he mentioned 2 types of resisters, the active resisters and the passive resisters, and the active resisters are the more difficult people to obtain support from.  The active resisters are those who “don’t like change under any circumstances.  Perhaps they are a few years from retirement and the last thing they want is to have their life turned upside down.  Often they are in a position to protest with impunity.  You may win them over to your camp, but consider yourself lucky if you can negotiate a deal with them that lets them change as little as possible in return for their support.” (Terrill, Page 122-123)

With a deeper understanding of the root of technology resistance and strains in staff relations, the Technology and Networking Coordinator should be in a better position to improve and effectively manage his or her relationships with the other staff.

== Tackling Staff Relations Challenge #1 ==

Once the Technology and Networking Coordinator has developed a better understanding of his or her co-workers’ strengths and weaknesses, as well as their fears and pressures, the Technology and Networking Coordinator will be in a better position to plan for ways to improve and manage a better relationship.

Align goals: One way to obtain support from the co-workers is to meet with them and show how their goals and the Technology Coordinator’s goals are aligned.  For example, the Technology and Networking Coordinator can approach teachers who teach subjects in Business and show these teachers how important it is for students to obtain an education enriched with networking technology in order to be competitive in the job marketplace.  The Technology and Networking Coordinator can also approach teachers who teach subjects in foreign language and show them network technology tools that can connect their students with students in a foreign country.

Respect your co-workers, be supportive, be a team-player: Some older staff who have not grown up during the digital and information age might feel very insecure when it comes to using technology.  In addition, some co-workers might have a personality that is overly-sensitive, he or she may resent the reliance on others.  They might resent the fact that they are always the less knowledgeable party when it comes to technology.  When giving these staff networking and IT guidance and help, the Technology and Networking Coordinator should maintain their respect for these staff and their line of work, the Technology and Networking Coordinator should especially be careful to not correct the other’s IT mistakes in public.  By showing respect to the staff, the Technology and Networking Coordinator is also adopting a non-threatening attitude that will help to ease the insecurity felt by those staff who fear for their job security.  To interact with those co-workers who resents direction and help from others, the Technology and Networking Coordinator should use words such as “tips” and “suggestions” to show that he or she is not giving them orders or challenging their intelligence and knowledge in IT.  To be supportive to his or her staff, the Technology and Networking Coordinator can establish a support group among the teachers and school staff as well as holding regular “open-door” office hours and welcome any co-workers who are seeking IT support.  In a web posted job description of a Technology Coordinator, the following was stated for the school’s expectation of its Technology Coordinator: (Website: Technology Coordinator, http://www.k12.hi.us/~wilcox/techcoor.html)
	
The ideal school Technology coordinator would:

- ensure that teacher in-service training is ongoing in the school

- organize and be responsible for the continued development of Technology Cadres (consisting of teachers and students) in the school.

- be responsible for training and utilizing a technology cadre consisting of teachers and students to help assist in training, trouble shooting and installations of hardware and software.

- participate in the continued development, with the administration and faculty, spectrum of skills for students to be able to attain, with benchmarks and timeframes, from K through 6.

- work cooperatively and productively with the school administration and faculty. &quot;People&quot; skills are needed because everyone works at different levels when they are being trained on &quot;how to&quot; use technology.

- help establish support groups for new technology based programs introduced by the school administration.

Keep the knowledge and information flowing: To help his or her co-workers to overcome their fear of technology, the Technology and Networking Coordinator should take the initiative to offer training sessions in Technology and Networking to help the staff learn more about the advantages offered by technology.  The more familiar the staff become with the various forms of technology, the less likely they will display outward resistance to the adoption of new technology in the classroom.  Based on the website Technology Coordinator’s Handbook – A Website Dedicated to School-based Technology Professionals, an effective Technology Coordinator should work with the human resources department “to survey the staff with needs assessment tools to ensure that all training opportunities are aligned to the goals of the various plans in place such as Technology Plan, School Improvement Plan and National Standards for teachers and administrators.” (School-based Technology Coordinator’s Home Page, http://schools.pinellas.k12.fl.us/tchandbk/default.htm)

== Staff Relations Challenge #2: Coping with too many IT help requests from fellow staff ==

When the school adopts a new technology or installs a new network, it would be natural for the first few weeks or months to be hectic and filled with database or network problems.  Naturally, the Technology and Networking coordinator might feel overwhelmed with the overwhelming requests for IT help from his or her co-workers.  

== Tackling Staff Relations Challenge #2 ==

It is natural for the Technology and Networking Coordinator to feel frustrated and overworked when he or she is being called on constantly by his or her co-workers for help in addition to fulfilling the regular job duties and the IT projects.  The Technology and Networking Coordinator can try the following guidelines in resolving this challenge:

Open communication: When the Technology and Networking Coordinator is being pulled by teacher A and teacher B at the same time to help them with their problems, the Technology and Networking Coordinator can get them together either in person or by the phone and explain to them that the Technology and Networking Coordinator would be more than happy to help them both, however, there is a time conflict and the Technology and Networking Coordinator can’t visit 2 classrooms at the same time.  Then ask the 2 teachers to see if they can come to some sort of agreement on whose IT problem should be resolved first.  It is possible that the 2 teachers might get into some sort of disagreement on whose problem should receive priority.  Openly discuss both of these teachers’ problems over the phone and encourage all to focus on the problems instead of fighting with each other.

== Staff Relations Challenge #3: The principal and the school administration is not enthusiastic about your technology initiatives ==

In other words, the principal and the other school administrators are not supporting the Technology and Networking Coordinator’s technology proposals.  Principals should be the key leaders in technology integration efforts, it is crucial for the Technology and Networking Coordinator to obtain the support from the principal.   The principal needs to be aware of the benefits offered by technology tools in order to effectively lead the integration of technology into the classroom.  However, due to the principals’ busy schedules, they often do not have the time to be trained in technology in order to know first hand the benefits offered by technology.  

== Tackling Staff Relations Challenge #3 ==

Take the initiative to set up meetings with the principal and the management team at the school.  In these meetings, the Technology and Networking Coordinator should show that he or she identifies with the principal’s strategic goals for the school, then show how the technology plans can help the school to reach those goals.  For example, if one of the strategic goals for the school is to aspire to become a “learning organization”, the Technology and Networking Coordinator can demonstrate how technology can help the teachers and the other staff to become a learning organization through continuous learning, empowerment by IT, and the creation and distribution of information. (Wilson, Page 100-102)  

If one of the goals for the school is to improve its curriculum, the Technology and Networking Coordinator can demonstrate to the principal and the school management board how today’s high-speed network can revolutionize knowledge gathering for the new curriculum.  With a better network infrastructure, teachers and students can have access to information that can give them insights and knowledge in every academic subject.

If one of the goals for the school is to increase access to more courses for its students, the Technology and Networking Coordinator can demonstrate how the IT network and technology can bring customized knowledge to the students through distance learning.  With distance learning, the school’s students will no longer need to go to a certain location at a certain time to take a course or obtain training in a certain subject, they can remotely access various courses and tailor their class schedules that would respond to each of their learning needs.

== Closing remarks and suggestions for further reading ==

The Technology Coordinators’ jobs are getting harder with new technology innovations and the expectations from school leaderships that the Technology Coordinators are expected to introduce new technologies into the classrooms, manage change, and provide technical leadership and support to his or her co-workers who in turn, might misdirect their fears of innovation and frustrations from the change process towards the Technology Coordinators.  In order to be successful at their jobs, the Technology Coordinators should not only possess sound technical knowledge about networking and other technological tools, but they should also become well-versed in interpersonal skills in order to effectively introduce and manage change.  This Chapter has reviewed some causes for staff relationship strains in the professional lives of the Technology Coordinators as well as given some suggestions on how to address these challenges.

Following are two external resources that can serve as guides and additional readings for Technology and Networking Coordinators:

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TProblem |
A poll is taken in regards to a sports car.  Of the 1000 people in the class, the polling results came back for the two series of questions:

Question 1:
* How many people would buy a brand new sports car for $500,000: 10 people
* How many people would buy a brand new sports car for $50,000: 95 people
* How many people would buy a brand new sports car for $5,000: 812 people
* How many people would buy a brand new sports car for $500: 995 people
* How many people would buy a brand new sports car for $50: 999 people
* How many people would buy a brand new sports car for $5: 1000 people

Question 2:
* How many people would sell their brand new sports car for $500,000: 995 people
* How many people would sell their brand new sports car for $50,000: 500 people
* How many people would sell their brand new sports car for $5,000: 90 people
* How many people would sell their brand new sports car for $500: 3 people
* How many people would sell their brand new sports car for $50: 1 person
* How many people would sell their brand new sports car for $5: 0 people

What would be the appropriate balance of price and people interested?
}}

{{Answer |
This is a supply and demand curve.  The demand for a car increases as price goes down while the supply of people for cars goes up as the price goes up.  The balance would be at the point of intersect of the two curves.  The Y-axis would be price of car while the X-axis would be number of people

Looking at the $50,000 and $5,000, we can see that the number of people goes from 95 to 812 for demand while the number goes from 500 to 90 for supply.  Somewhere between these two points, the lines intersected.  If one were to draw out the curves in detail, they could interpolate the intersection point to be approximately at $25,000, with a number of buyers and sellers being equal to 350.

[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]]'''Solution:'''&lt;br&gt;
Convert everything to Present Value and see just how great a deal this is.

For the present value of the $5,000,000 benefit (gas reduction):

&lt;math&gt;
P = \frac{F}{{\left( {1 + i} \right)^n }} = \frac{$5,000,000}{{\left( {1 + 0.03} \right)^{10} }} = $3,720,469.57
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The benefit in present-day value is $3,720,469.57.

For the money (cost) being sent to the contractor, a payment of $470,000 per year, the present value would be:

&lt;math&gt;
P = A\left[ {\frac{{\left( {1 + i} \right)^n  - 1}}{{i\left( {1 + i} \right)^n }}} \right] = $470,000\left[ {\frac{{\left( {1 + 0.03} \right)^{10}  - 1}}{{0.03\left( {1 + 0.03} \right)^{10} }}} \right] = $4,009,195.33
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The cost in present-day value is $4,009,195.33.  Therefore, this detail, while shiny in appearance at first, is NOT a wise decision, since costs exceed benefits.

&lt;/div&gt;

==1. Distinguish:==
===a. Mammal from other animals.===
The mammals are the class of vertebrate animals characterized by the presence of mammary glands, which in females produce milk for the nourishment of young.

===b. Placentals, marsupials and monotremes from one another.===
;Placentals: The placentals are distinguished from other mammals in that the fetus is nourished during pregnancy via a placenta.  

;Marsupials:Marsupials are mammals in which the female typically has a pouch (called the marsupium) in which it rears its young through early infancy. They differ from placental mammals in their reproductive traits.  

;Monotremes: Monotremes are mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young like marsupials and placental mammals.

==2. Understand how marsupials are classified into families and describe, in a general way, the habits of these families.==
Marsupials are classed mainly by their dietary habits.  
;Herbivorous marsupials: (such as kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, wombats, and possums) eat only plants.  
;Carnivorous marsupials: (such as Tasmanian devils, numbats, and quolls) eat only meat.  They are very similar to one another in shape, though their sizes vary considerably.
;Omnivorous Marsupials: (such as opossums) eat just about anything they can find.

==3. Describe the distribution, habitat (ie. type of country they live in), diet breeding behavior, as well as any other interesting information of twelve different groups of marsupials and monotremes.==

===Tasmanian Devil===
[[Image:Tasdevil large.jpg|thumb|200px]]
The Tasmanian Devil (''Sarcophilus harrisii''), also referred to simply as &quot;the devil&quot;, is a carnivorous marsupial now found in the wild only in the Australian island state of Tasmania. The Tasmanian Devil is the only extant member of the genus ''Sarcophilus''. The size of a small dog, but stocky and muscular, the Tasmanian Devil is now the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world after the extinction of the Thylacine in 1936. It is characterised by its black fur, offensive odor when stressed, extremely loud and disturbing screech, and viciousness when feeding. It is known to both hunt prey and scavenge carrion and although it is usually solitary, it sometimes eats with other devils.

The Tasmanian Devil became extirpated on the Australian mainland about 400 years before European settlement in 1788. Because they were seen as a threat to livestock in Tasmania, devils were hunted until 1941, when they became officially protected. Since the late 1990s devil facial tumour disease has reduced the devil population significantly and now threatens the survival of the species, which in May of 2008 was finally declared to be endangered. Programs are currently being undertaken by the Tasmanian government to reduce the impact of the disease.

Tasmanian Devils can take prey up to the size of a small wallaby, but in practice they are opportunistic, and eat carrion more often than they hunt live prey. Although the devil favours wombats, it will eat all small native mammals, domestic mammals (including sheep), birds, fish, insects, frogs and reptiles. Their diet is largely varied and depends on the food available. On average, they eat about 15% of their body weight each day; however, they can eat up to 40% of their body weight in 30 minutes if the opportunity arises. Tasmanian Devils eliminate all traces of a carcass, devouring the bones and fur in addition to the meat and internal organs. In this respect, the devil has earned the gratitude of Tasmanian farmers, as the speed at which they clean a carcass helps prevent the spread of insects that might otherwise harm livestock.

===Numbat===
[[Image:Numbat.jpg|thumb|200px]]
The Numbat is a small, colorful creature between 20 and a little under 30 cm long, with a finely pointed muzzle and a prominent, bushy tail about the same length as its body. Color varies considerably, from soft grey to reddish-brown, often with an area of brick red on the upper back, and always with a conspicuous black stripe running from the tip of the muzzle through the eyes to the bases of the small, round-tipped ears. The underside is cream or light grey; weight varies between 280 and 550 grams.

Adult Numbats are solitary and territorial; an individual of either sex establishes a territory of up to 150 hectares (370 acres)[4] early in life, and defends it from others of the same sex. The animal generally remains within it from that time on; male and female territories overlap, and in the breeding season males will venture outside their normal home range to find mates.

Another common name for the Numbat was Banded Anteater, though this has now fallen into disuse. Though it will in fact consume ants, its diet otherwise consists almost exclusively of termites.

While the numbat has relatively powerful claws for its size,[4] it is not strong enough to get at termites inside the concrete-like mound, and so must wait until the termites are active. It uses a well-developed sense of smell to locate the shallow and unfortified underground galleries that termites construct between the nest and their feeding sites; these are usually only a short distance below the surface of the soil, and vulnerable to the Numbat's digging claws.

===Quoll===
[[Image:SpottedQuoll 2005 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|200px]]
Quolls or native cats (genus ''Dasyurus'') are carnivorous marsupials, native to Australia and Papua New Guinea. Adults are between 25 and 75 cm long, with hairy tails about 20-35 cm long. Females have six to eight nipples and develop a pouch—which opens towards the tail—only during the breeding season, when they are rearing young. The babies are the size of a grain of rice. Quolls live both in forests and in open valley land. Though primarily ground-dwelling, they have developed secondary arboreal characteristics. They do not have prehensile tails, but do have ridges on the pads of their feet. Their molars and canines are strongly developed.

The Eastern Quoll is a solitary predator, hunting at night for its prey of insects and small mammals. They have also been known to scavenge food from the much larger Tasmanian Devil.

The breeding season begins in early winter, and the female gives birth to up to 30 young. Of these, the first to attach themselves to the six teats will be the only survivors. Weaning takes place at about 10 weeks of age, with the young staying in the den while the mother forages.

===Kangaroos===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 heights=200px&gt;
Image:Red kangaroo - melbourne zoo.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Red Kangaroo&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Kangaroo and joey03.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Eastern Grey Kanagroo&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Western Grey Kangaroo SMC 2006.JPG|&lt;center&gt;Western Grey Kangaroo&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

There are three species of kangaroo:
* The '''Red Kangaroo''' (''Macropus rufus'') is the largest surviving marsupial anywhere in the world. Fewer in numbers, the Red Kangaroos occupy the arid and semi-arid centre of the continent. A large male can be 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 90 kg (200 lb).
* The '''Eastern Grey Kangaroo''' (''Macropus giganteus'') is less well-known than the red (outside of Australia), but the most often seen, as its range covers the fertile eastern part of the continent.
* The '''Western Grey Kangaroo''' (''Macropus fuliginosus'') is slightly smaller again at about 54 kg (119 lb) for a large male. It is found in the southern part of Western Australia, South Australia near the coast, and the Darling River basin.

===Wallabies===
[[Image:Red-necked-Wallaby.jpg|thumb|200px]]
Essentially, a wallaby is any macropod that isn't large enough to be considered a kangaroo and has not been given some other name. There is no fixed dividing line. In general, a wallaby is smaller and has a stockier build than a kangaroo; a wallaroo is any of a few species somewhat intermediate in size between a wallaby and a kangaroo.
{{clear}}
===Possums===
[[Image:Brushtail possum.jpg|thumb|200px]]
Possums are small marsupials with brown or grey fur, ranging in size from the length of a finger (pygmy possums and wrist-winged gliders), to the length of a forearm (brushtails and ringtails). All possums are nocturnal and omnivorous, hiding in a nest in a hollow tree during the day and coming out during the night to forage for food. They fill much the same role in the Australian ecosystem that squirrels fill in the northern hemisphere and are broadly similar in appearance.

The two most common species of possums, the Common Brushtail and Common Ringtail, are also among the largest.
{{clear}}

===Opossums===
[[Image:AwesomePossum-AmericanOpossum.jpg|thumb|200px]]
Opossums are nocturnal marsupials found in the Western Hemisphere.  They are small to medium-sized creatures, about the size of a large house cat.  Although there are many exceptions, most of them spend time living both in trees and on the ground, and they eat many different things (plants and animals).

Opossums are usually nomadic, staying in one area as long as food and water are easily available. Though they will temporarily occupy abandoned burrows, they do not dig or put much effort into building their own. They favor dark, secure areas, below ground or above.

When threatened or harmed, they will &quot;play possum&quot;, mimicking the appearance and smell of a sick or dead animal. The lips are drawn back, teeth are bared, saliva foams around the mouth, and a foul-smelling fluid is secreted from glands. This response is involuntary, rather than a conscious act. Their stiff, curled form can be prodded, turned over, and even carried away. Many injured opossums have been killed by well-meaning people who find a catatonic animal and assume the worst. If you find an injured or apparently dead opossum, the best thing to do is leave it in a quiet place with a clear exit path. In minutes or hours, the animal will regain consciousness and escape quietly on its own.

===Shrew Opossums===
[[Image:Shrew opossum - Caenolestidae.png|thumb|200px]]
Shrew opossums (also known as rat opossums) are about the size of a small rat (9–14 cm long), with thin limbs, a long, pointed snout and a slender, hairy tail. They are largely meat-eaters, being active hunters of insects, earthworms and small vertebrates. They have small eyes and poor sight, and hunt in the early evening and at night, using their hearing and long, sensitive whiskers to locate prey. They seem to spend much of their lives in underground burrows and on surface runways.

Largely because of their rugged, inaccessible habitat, they are very poorly known and have traditionally been considered rare. Recent studies suggest that they may be more common than had been thought.

===Koalas===
[[Image:Koala climbing tree.jpg|thumb|200px]]
The Koala is broadly similar in appearance to the wombat, but has a thicker, more luxurious coat, much larger ears, and longer limbs, which are equipped with large, sharp claws to assist with climbing. Weight varies from about 14 kg for a large, southern male, to about 5 kg for a small northern female. Contrary to popular belief, their fur is thick, not soft and cuddly. Koalas' five fingers per paw are arranged with the first two as opposable thumbs, providing better gripping ability.

===Wombats===
[[Image:Wombat at Lone Pine.jpg|thumb|200px]]
Wombats are Australian marsupials; they are short-legged, muscular quadrupeds, approximately one meter (3 feet) in length and with a very short tail. Wombats have an extraordinarily slow metabolism, taking around 14 days to complete digestion, and generally move slowly. When required, however, they can reach up to 40 km/h and maintain that speed for up to 90 seconds.

When attacked, they can summon immense reserves of strength — one defense of a wombat against a predator (such as a Dingo) underground is to crush it against the roof of the tunnel until it stops breathing.

===Tree-kangaroo===
[[Image:Buergers' Tree-kangaroo back and tail.jpg|thumb|200px]]
Tree-kangaroos are macropods adapted for life in trees. They are found in the rainforests of New Guinea, far northeastern Queensland, and nearby islands, usually in mountainous areas. Although most are found in mountainous areas, several species also occur in lowlands, and one, the aptly named Lowlands Tree-kangaroo, appears to be restricted to lowlands.

Tree-kangaroos feed mostly on leaves and fruit, taken both in trees and on the ground, but other foods are eaten when available, including grain, flowers, sap, bark, eggs and young birds. Their teeth are adapted for tearing leaves rather than cutting grass.

===Wallaroo===
[[Image:Macropus robustus.jpg|thumb|200px]]
A wallaroo is any of three closely related species of moderately large macropod, intermediate in size between the kangaroos and the wallabies. The name &quot;wallaroo&quot; is a portmanteau of wallaby and kangaroo. In general, a large, slim-bodied macropod of the open plains is called a &quot;kangaroo&quot;; a small to medium-sized one, particularly if it is relatively thick-set, is a &quot;wallaby&quot;: most wallaroos are only a little smaller than a kangaroo, fairly thickset, and are found in open country. All share a particular habit of stance: wrists raised, elbows tucked close into the body, and shoulders thrown back, and all have a large, black-skinned rhinarium.

The best-known species is ''Macropus robustus'', which is known as the Eastern Wallaroo, Common Wallaroo or just Wallaroo on the slopes of the Great Dividing Range (which runs for more than 3,000 km around the eastern and south-eastern coast of Australia), and as the Euro in most of the rest of the continent. There are four subspecies: the Eastern Wallaroo and the Euro, which are both widespread, and two of more restricted range, one from Barrow Island, the other from the Kimberley.

The Black Wallaroo (''Macropus bernardus'') occupies an area of steep, rocky ground in Arnhem Land. At around 60 to 70 cm in length (excluding tail) it is the smallest wallaroo and the most heavily built. Males weigh 19 to 22 kg, females about 13 kg. Because it is very wary and is found only in a small area of remote and very rugged country, it is remarkably little known.

The Antilopine Wallaroo (''Macropus antilopinus'') is the exception among wallaroos. It is, essentially, the far-northern equivalent of the Eastern and Western Grey Kangaroos. Like them, it is a creature of the grassy plains and woodlands, and gregarious, where the other wallaroos are solitary. Because of this difference, it is sometimes called the Antilopine Kangaroo.
===Pademelon===
[[Image:RedNeckedPademelon-front-800.jpg|thumb|200px]]
A pademelon is any of seven species of small marsupials of the genus ''Thylogale''. They are usually found in forests. Pademelons are the smallest of the macropods. The name is a corruption of badimaliyan, from the Dharuk Aboriginal language of Port Jackson.

Pademelons, wallabies, and kangaroos are very alike in body structure, and the names just refer to the three different size groups. Originally wallabies were divided into small and large wallabies, but a more suitable name was needed to differentiate between them.

Besides their smaller size, pademelons can be distinguished from wallabies by their shorter, thicker, and sparsely haired tails.

If there are no predators, such as dogs, they graze in the early mornings or evenings on grassy slopes near thickets into which they can quickly escape at the first sign of danger. Having noticed danger, such as a python, they may try to warn others by stomping their feet on the ground producing surprisingly loud sound. Pademelons are nocturnal and tend to feed at night.

Their main diet is made up of grasses, leaves, and small shoots. They do little damage to crops and are not as aggressive as wallabies and kangaroos can be, making them gentle pets.

Normally, a group of females would stay on the territory with males showing up, only when one of the females is ready for mating. This is in contrast to the behavior of bigger kangaroos, who stay in mixed mobs with a male leader.
{{clear}}

===Quokka===
[[Image:Rottnest Quokka 2004 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|200px]]
The Quokka (''Setonix brachyurus''), the only member of the genus ''Setonix'', is a small macropod about the size of a large domestic cat. Like other marsupials in the macropod family (such as the kangaroos and wallabies), the Quokka is herbivorous and mainly nocturnal.

In the wild, its roaming is restricted to a very small range in the South-West of Western Australia. The Quokka has become rare, but remains a protected species on islands off the coast of that area, Bald Island, Rottnest Island, Garden Island and rarely Penguin Island. The islands are free of foxes and cats. On Rottnest Island, it is common and occupies a wide range of habitats, ranging from semi-arid scrub to cultivated gardens.

The Quokka is gregarious and gathers in large groups where food is available: primary items are grasses, sedges, succulents and foliage. The health of some animals has suffered significantly by the ingestion of inappropriate foods, such as bread, given by well meaning visitors to Rottnest Island. Visitors are now asked to refrain from feeding them. It breeds at any time on the mainland, but in late summer on Rottnest. The Quokka only produces a single joey in a year. Restricted availability of the trace element copper appears to be a major limiting factor of the ability of the Quokka to breed on Rottnest.

The Quokka's movements are similar to a kangaroo, using mixture of small and large hops.

==4. Be able to explain the difference between marsupial reproduction and that in true mammals (ie. placentals).==
The pregnant female marsupial develops a kind of yolk sack in her womb which delivers nutrients to the embryo. The embryo is born at a very early stage of development (at about 4-5 weeks), upon which it crawls up its mother's belly and attaches itself to a nipple (which is located inside the pouch). It remains attached to the nipple for a number of weeks. The offspring later passes through a stage where it temporarily leaves the pouch, returning for warmth and nourishment.

The placenta is a temporary organ composed of two parts, one of which is part of the fetus, the other part of the mother. It is implanted in the wall of the uterus, where it receives nutrients and oxygen from the mother's blood and passes out waste. This interface forms a barrier, the placental barrier, which filters out some substances which could harm the fetus.

==5. Explain the significance of the direction of opening of the pouch and the number of young per litter in marsupials.==
[[Image:Joey in pouch.jpg|thumb|200px|Kangaroo joey inside the pouch]]
The pouch is a distinguishing feature of female marsupials; the name marsupial is derived from the Latin marsupium, meaning pouch. Marsupials give birth to a live but relatively undeveloped fetus called a joey. When the joey is born it crawls from inside the mother to the pouch. The pouch is basically a fold of skin with a single opening that covers the nipples to protect the joey as it continues to develop.

Pouches are different amongst the different marsupials: for example for Quolls and Tasmanian Devils, the pouch opens to the rear and the joey only has to travel a short distance to get to the opening of the pouch. While in the pouch they are permanently attached to the nipple and once the young have developed they leave the pouch and do not return. The kangaroo's pouch opens horizontally on the front of the body, and the joey must climb a relatively long way to reach it. Kangaroos and wallabies allow their young to live in the pouch well after they are physically capable of leaving. 

Tasmanian Devils give birth to up to 50 young, each weighing approximately 0.18–0.24 grams. When the young are born, they move from the vagina to the pouch. Once inside the pouch, they each remain attached to a nipple for the next 100 days. Despite the large litter at birth, the female has only four nipples, so that no more than four young can survive birth. On average, more females survive than males.  The female Tasmanian Devil's pouch, like that of the wombat, opens to the rear, so it is physically difficult for the female to interact with young inside the pouch. Unlike kangaroo joeys, young devils (and other marsupials with rear-opening pouches) do not return to the pouch; instead, they remain in the den for another three months, first venturing outside the den between October and December before becoming independent in January.

==6. Give an explanation of the unique occurrence of marsupials in Australia.==
Marsupial success in Australia has been attributed to the lack of placental mammals living there.   When marsupials and placental mammals share an environment, the placental mammals typically outcompete the marsupials and the marsupials do not survive.

It has also been suggested that since marsupials have a lower metabolic rate, they are better able to survive the heat of Australia.  However, this conjecture does not account for the success of placental mammals in other hot climates such as Africa and India.  Furthermore, placental mammals, when introduced to Australia, repeatedly demonstrate their fitness to Australia's climate by outcompeting the marsupials.

==7. Be able to explain the need for conservation of our marsupials.==
Many marsupials have been listed as endangered species.  Until the Europeans arrived in Australia, it was an isolated continent and no placental mammals (other than man) were able to travel there.  When the Europeans arrived on ships, they brought placental mammals with them - sometimes intentionally, as in the case of cattle and sheep, and sometimes unintentionally, as in the case of rats and mice.  These placental mammals pose a great threat to the native marsupials, as they compete for the same resources, often displacing them.

==8. Write a report of your visit to a natural history museum, wild-life sanctuary, zoo, etc. indicating in about 10-15 lines, the extent of your observations.==
The place you visit should presumably have some marsupials in its collection, and the 10-15 lines should document observations of the marsupials.  Here are some ideas for the sorts of things you might be looking for:

*'''Species:'''  what is the name of this marsupial?  What is its scientific name?
*'''Natural habitat:''' where does this animal live in the wild?
*'''Artificial habitat:''' how were its needs being met (if it was a live animal)
*'''Diet:'''  How does its natural diet compare to its diet in the sanctuary or zoo?
*'''Conservation Status:''' is this animal threatened or endangered?  If so, what is being done to conserve it?
*'''Breeding:''' Were the animals in this collection part of a breeding program?
*'''Young:''' Did you see any young marsupials? Were they in their mother's pouch?
*'''Unique Features:''' what is unique about this animal?
*'''Fascinating Features:''' what did you like best about this animal?

If you choose to visit a zoo or wildlife sanctuary, be sure to check out the [[../Endangered Animals|Endangered Animals]] honor too, as this will meet a requirement for that honor as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Making the Student Computer Decision =
By R. Wilensky
== Student Computer Fundamentals ==
When developing a network infrastructure design in a school environment, one critical component of a network infrastructure design in a school environment is the choice of student computers that you opt to deploy. The reason that this decision is so critical is that it will affect all other aspects of the network infrastructure. But, how do you make this, often 'religious', decision? The answer to this question, and hence any purchasing decisions, can be found through an initial assessment. There are several factors that you must consider when making this decision. We will touch on each factor briefly. Following this assessment, you can begin researching the options available. Both platform and form factor choices will be considered. Platform refers to the hardware and operating system of the units while form factor refers to mobility and data residence. Lastly, I will include several case studies.

=== Objectives ===
Before beginning any of the assessments, your should begin by having an objective for the students' usage of these computers. This may be dictated by administration, faculty, parents or other parties of interest, but the ultimate result must be clearly defined. In the business world, this is called the requirements gathering and mission statement phase. While the goals may seem obvious (we want the students to integrate technologies to enhance learning), the actual implementation of this goal is quite complex. That is because people's ideas of how this gets implemented varies significantly. Make sure your mission statement is clear and that your objectives are listed as SMART goals. SMART goals are Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Realistic and Time-bound. For example, one goal may be to &quot;Enhance literacy by ensuring that each student maintains his/her own blog by the end of the school year and posts entries at least once per month.&quot; Remember that the key questions you should be answering in determining goals and objectives are &quot;What do you want your kids to be able to do? What should they be able to produce using the computers?&quot;says Kevin Gole, NYC Public School Teacher.

=== Application Assessment and Selection ===
The next consideration must be application oriented. Before making any decision with regard to student computer selection, you need to inventory and analyze your existing software in use at the school today, as well as software you would like to use in the future. 

It is equally important to look at freeware/opensource options as well. Application assessment is critical because you obviously don't want to deploy student computers that will not be useful for enhancing learning in the classroom. If you don't know what you'll need ask your Educational Technology Specialist, Computer Teacher, Librarian, computer-saavy teachers and even students. Enlist help to make sure you are getting the right tools. 

=== Existing Infrastructure ===
Most schools today have some form of student computers in the district already. Similarly to application assessments, you must do an inventory and assessment of your existing infrastructure. 

Once you have assessed your current environment and can reasonably estimate the expected life remaining on each system, you are ready to begin thinking about your future computer needs. 

=== Security ===
You have to know your school on this one. Consider both the physical security of the computers and the issues of ensuring that the computers are not compromised by viruses, spam and the like. It is easy to neglect the applications running on the operating system but &quot;hackers are starting to attack the applications more often because they know users are not updating them&quot; as frequently as the operating system (Terrill, 2006, p. 60). 

=== Cost ===
Obviously, for a school environment, cost of systems and anticipated budget are key things to consider. It would be easy to look at your budget, get quotes from various computer manufacturers, subtract and see what you have left. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. The &quot;cost&quot; of purchasing student computers is more than just the cost of the hardware and the software (which, by the way, is often heavily discounted for educational institutions). There are also support costs. &quot;Cost of operation can be determined by multiplying the expected frequency of trouble by the cost of getting the problems fixed (Terrill, 2006, p. 22).&quot; There is also the cost of training any administrators for any new applications. The last item to think about, which is often overlooked, is the cost of replacement. 

=== Future Growth ===
Replacement cost leads us to the discussion of future growth. In addition to the number of students that each year will bring, there is is the consideration of computing demands. As technologies advance and as technology becomes more integrated into curricula, system capacity requirements will increase in order to support the demands that students will place on them.

== Platform Choices == 
This section will provide a brief overview into the different platform choices available.  It is impossible to cover significant details on each solution however links to various reference sites are provided below.  A word of caution when beginning your research is to be aware of vendor biases.  All vendors mentioned have a division solely devoted to education and you should request a meeting with your local sales representative (and sales engineer). There is also what I call &quot;User Bias.&quot; User bias is the inclination by students and teachers to favor a particular platform, largely because this is what they are &quot;used to.&quot;  This should be considered but not allowed to create tunnel vision for alternate and perhaps more appropriate solutions. 

=== The &quot;PC&quot; ===
The Personal Computer is general acknowledged as the most popular home computer with the Windows Operating System having the largest market share among desktop users.  It is also generally accepted that there are the most applications for Windows.  That being said, it may or may not be appropriate for your school.  The PC model differs from the Mac model below in that the operating system and hardware are made by different manufacturers.  Microsoft licenses it's operating system to OEM's (Original Equipment Manufacturers) like Dell, IBM, HP, and Sun so it will be important to compare pricing, support and other options among all manufacturers when considering a PC decision.  [http://www.microsoft.com/education/default.mspx Microsoft in Education]

:Microsoft understands that technology funding can be a significant hurdle for educational institutions - one that  can keep you from realizing your vision for using computers as powerful educational tools.  Moving to Windows Vista can actually help reduce your information technology (IT) costs, because the operating system is easier to deploy, manage, and support (&quot;Make the PC an educational tool-not an expense-with Windows Vista&quot;, 2008)

The benefits to using a PC are that the learning curve should be easy for most users (since many students and teachers have them at home), there is a wealth of applications available, and the cost is typically less than Mac environments since there is competition on the hardware side of the equation.  The challenges are typically focused on concerns over security. Windows is a favorite target of hackers, viruses, spam and other malware and while protection software and hardware design can minimize the risk, there is always concern in this regard.  Additionally, PC hardware (mice, keyboards, laptops, etc...) and data are subject to theft more easily than in other environments.

=== The &quot;Mac&quot; ===
While PC's have the lion's share of the market in the desktop space, Apple's Macintosh is certainly gaining headway in the laptop arena.  The main difference from a pure purchasing perspective is that Apple manufactures and distributes the hardware and the operating system (OSX, a form of linux).  The other important consideration is that Mac's have always been known to excel at desktop publishing and other multimedia type applications. [http://www.apple.com/education/k12/curriculumsolutions/collections.html Apple in Education]

:Apple helps schools engage students with a 21st century digital learning environment that mirrors the way they live - and increasingly would like to learn (&quot;Apple - Education - K-12.&quot;, 2008).  Apple Distinguished Schools are recognized by Apple for their demonstrated success in implementing a 21st century learning environment (&quot;Apple Learning Interchange - Apple Distinguished Schools&quot;, 2008).

The benefits of deploying a Mac environment are that it is easy for students and teachers to use and learn.  It is also more secure than PC environments because, to date, it is less likely to be the target of malicious attacks and typically is designed with fewer security holes.  This is even more true now that the Mac OS is an implementation of linux. Additionally, [http://www.apple.com/education/profiles/cartersville/ Mac's now support running Windows XP alongside OSX]. The challenges are that fewer application choices exist for the Mac and it is traditional the most expensive option.  Additionally, most enterprises utilize PC's and in teaching for 21 century jobs, consideration should be given to the transferability of knowledge.

=== &quot;Lintel&quot; ===
Lintel is the catch-all phrase used to describe any distribution of Linux on an Intel chip and although these days Linux is equally likely to be deployed on an AMD processor, I use the term here generically to describe this platform.  Linux is the newest player to enter the field of education, at least in the K-12 space. Linux and it's cousin, Unix, have been used for far longer than Mac's or PC's in the higher education area.  Like PC's, Linux distributions are not packaged together with the hardware.  RedHat is the most popular distribution of linux but plenty of others exist.  The choices for hardware are the same as the choices for PC's. The [http://www.classroom20.com/forum/topic/show?id=649749%3ATopic%3A167773 debate on using Linux in K-12] is still open. 

The benefits of linux are its increasing popularity, low cost and tight security.  Good uses of it for K-12 would be programming classes and classes teaching about web site administration and infrastructure because these are popular applications for linux.  The challenges for a Lintel solution are limited applications and possibly more complex management and administration.  It is also important to note that while linux is typically thought of as &quot;free&quot;support, indemnification and maintenance make the total cost of ownership decisively &quot;not free.&quot;

== Form Factor Choices ==
=== The Desktop ===
Schools around the country and administrations in particular are pushing for &quot;wireless cafe's&quot; at school.  However, there are some compelling reasons to consider sticking with traditional desktops.  First, let's talk about battery life.  Desktops are always connected to power so there is no concern about running out of &quot;juice&quot;in the middle of a lesson. Desktops are also (usually) wired - meaning they are connected to the Internet by cable (not wireless) so they are more secure and also less likely to lose connections to the Internet.  Use of multimedia is another consideration.  According to the IT Guy, &quot;if the computer will be used for hard-drive intensive activities like video editing, then a desktop has more hard drive expandability options&quot; (&quot;techLEARNING.com | Technology &amp; Learning - The Resource for Education Technology Leaders&quot;, 2008).  Generally speaking, the best uses for desktops in a school environment will be in student computer labs, student access in libraries, permanent computers in the classroom and multimedia stations throughout the school. 

=== The Laptop ===
Laptop carts (COWs) are all the rage these days.  There are some clear advantages for laptop carts in a school environment, however I'd like to start by pointing out some of the shortcomings first to remember that it's not necessarily nirvana.  First, as hinted at earlier, laptops run out of battery.  Secondly, one of the advantages of laptops (no connection required) is also a downfall.  Wireless access to the Internet is more of a security concern than wired access and also has issues of signal strength and scalability.  In practicality, a wireless access point supports up to 15-20 laptops depending on the location, according to Kevin Gole.  Lastly, there is the fact that students are more often than not asked to help carry several laptops at a time from one classroom to another and even the most responsible child has a tendency to drop things. Laptops will get dropped.  It is inevitable.  They are also more expensive than their desktop counterparts, not to mention that they are more susceptible to theft.  Ok, so with all the caveats, why even consider laptops? Because there are also a lot of benefits associated with these portable devices. 

Laptops distinct advantage is the mobility factor.  Laptop carts allow students to share computing power and also allow for more access to computers than would otherwise occur if they only went to the computer lab for one period per week.  Another advantage is that students feel a sense of ownership since they are &quot;assigned&quot; a specific laptop on the cart and can quickly find what they need.  As early as 2005, some schools became &quot;ebook-only&quot; schools meaning that laptops replaced traditional textbooks throughout the school (&quot;Arizona school ditches texts for laptops - Engadget&quot;, 2005) and more schools have followed suit.  Whether or not schools allow students to take laptops home with them varies. &quot;In the United States, school districts and states with one-to-one laptop programs are considering ways in which the portable computers can be used outside the norm of in-class lessons, such as when bad weather or other events force schools to close&quot; (&quot;Education Week's Digital Directions: Learning Even When Schools Are Closed&quot;, 2008).

When considering laptops, the other additional component to factor in, is the laptop carts themselves.  Features to look for include power options, ventilation, caster movement, cabinet size, locking/security mechanisms and organization aspects (&quot;Laptop Carts - School Computing&quot;, 2008).

=== Mobile Devices ===
One short comment on mobile devices including mobile phone and PDA's: This is a yet unexplored area for learning and while there is a great debate on whether or not schools should or should not allow the presence of mobile phones or devices in schools, the penetration of mobile devices is only likely to continue.  Therefore, it is worth considering learning situations that might benefit from the use of these devices in the classroom and/or educational setting.  An example is the use of cell phones by students on a field trip to document and blog to their class blog sites (&quot;20 Ideas: Getting students to use their mobile phones as learning tools&quot;, 2008).

=== Thin Clients ===
&quot;One of an emerging array of choices for low-cost computing in schools, 'thin client' computing is an old idea that has been made new again.  The term refers to a decades-old arrangement in which many low-capacity computers - or thin clients - depend on a powerful central computer server to do most of their data processing. The data is passed back and forth between clients and servers over a network&quot; (&quot;Education Week: 'NComputing' Developers Tout Savings for Schools&quot;, 2008).  The advantage of a thin client environment is that you get &quot;the best of everything&quot;.  The actual processing systems can be PC, Mac, Linux or whatever else you may have and they are all managed centrally in the server room.  The actual student computer itself is nothing more than a &quot;smart&quot; terminal - a thin client device - so named because it typically has no hard drive in it. In fact, beyond a smart card reader, some USB ports and the input device ports, there is little to it. 

[[Image:SunRay.jpg|thumb|left|A SunRay]]
[[Image:SunRay%40Home.jpg|thumb|right|SunRay@Home]]
To illustrate the solution, Sun Microsystems Virtual Desktop Solution is described below.  The SunRay is a &quot;thin&quot; or &quot;virtual display&quot; client.  Virtual display clients are just as they sound.  They display any desktop as though they were running locally, but in fact they are running at the server level.  Sun Microsystems, like the Apple model, is the sole manufacturer of SunRay's in the desktop form factor and they also make the software that drives this architecture.  Companies like [http://www.accutechco.com/2_product_02.html Accutech] and [http://www.naturetechws.com/_2005/_products/_Jasper320.html  Naturetech] make SunRay laptops.  There is no configuration, operating system, or data residing on the student computers which offers more security and manageability over traditional PC's or Mac's.  Sun is helping schools to manage challenges such as limited budgets, rising costs of desktops, patch management overload and desktop downtime (&quot;Sun Virtual Desktop Solution: Connecting the Campus&quot;, 2008).

[[Image:SunRay-in-Schools_2_with_text.jpg|Thin Client Architecture in a School Environment|upright|1000x2000px]]

The benefits of a thin client architecture such as this are: enhanced security due to data residing in central location and hence minimization of device theft, flexibility to deploy multiple platforms easily, reuse of existing student computers and/or monitors, improved administration, reduced cost and more eco-friendly components.  Additional benefits of the Sun Virtual Desktop Solution include the ability for teachers to easily &quot;control&quot; the students desktops in the classroom and anytime anywhere access via a browser on any device. The challenges are management of a more complex server room, initial training considerations and limited multimedia functionality (currently).

== Case Studies ==
The final step in the decision making process, after assessing your current goals and environment, and after researching all the options, is to ask for references. You always want to talk to people who have done it. Ask them not only what worked but what pitfalls they encountered. Every situation is different but every situation will likely also have some similarities that you can use to further refine your choices. To that end, I will provide a few sample case studies below.

The PC Decision: &quot;''Tri-Center Community Schools educates 900 K-12 students on one campus in southwest Iowa. By upgrading its computers to ... Windows Vista® ..., the district provided teachers with state-of-the-art multimedia capabilities for creating more engaging learning experiences that better prepare students for college and work&quot; ''(&quot;Microsoft Case Studies: TriCenter Community Schools&quot;, 2008).

The Mac Decision: &quot;''Echo Lake Elementary continues to be recognized for its innovative use of technology in education... Echo Lake students and teachers are creating every day...Pages for student-generated newsletters to communicate to parents; Garageband for Civil Rights podcasts that connect literature to history; iMovie for stop-motion claymation fables... iPhoto for mathematic slideshows... iMovie for math tutorials... &lt;nowiki&gt;[and] iWeb for biography projects. &lt;/nowiki&gt;The beauty of Apple technology is that new projects are being generated every week, and the students keep raising the bar for one another''&quot; (&quot;Apple Learning Interchange - Echo Lake Elementary School&quot;, 2008).

The Thin Client Choice: ''J. Holland of Sun Microsystems described two urban school districts who have deployed thin client architectures. The first is one of the poorest districts in the US. They chose to install Sun Secure Global Desktop because they could not afford to replace the old unusable computers that were in place. This solution allowed students all over the district to access the extra tutoring available as part of NCLB. The other selling point was the ability for teachers to lock the displays of student computers while teaching a lesson. They plan to deploy low-cost SunRay's once multimedia support becomes available because they have a life-span of at least 10 years. The other urban district has already deployed SunRay's in their science classes. Java programs were taking about ½ the class time to load on the old computers they had in the classroom. Each student now has a SmartCard and simply inserts the card into the SunRay when they get to class, instantaneously bringing up the session where they left off the day before, regaining precious classroom time. They also were able to save money in reduced power consumption in a much quieter environment. See also: [http://uk.sun.com/sunnews/press/2006/2006-03-08.html UK Bradford School of the future]. ''

== Conclusion ==
While the preparation and choices may seem overwhelming, we must remember that &quot;Technology will not go away, and educators have to come to terms with it as an educational tool. &lt;nowiki&gt;Understanding technology and ...[its] force in society is incumbent on both students and adults&quot; (Cuban, 2003, p. 194). &lt;/nowiki&gt;So we, as educators, have a responsibility to our students to teach computer literacy. Today, computer literacy is more than simple office productivity software. It involves more powerful applications, a comfort level with technology usage throughout all disciplines and a general acceptance that 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century careers require 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century tools. 

:Computers are used in [/wiki/Schools schools] for many applications such as writing papers or searching the [/wiki/Internet Internet] for information. Computer skills are also a subject being specifically taught in many schools, especially from adolescence onward.... One problematic element of many (though not all) &quot;computer literacy&quot; or computer education programs is that they may resort too heavily on rote [/wiki/Memorization memorization]. Students may be taught, for example, how to perform several common functions (e.g.: Open a file,...) in very specific ways, using one specific version of one specific program. When a graduate of such a program encounters a competing program, or even a different version of the same program, they may be confused ... by the differences from what they learned. This is one reason why major computer ... firms ... consider the [/wiki/Education educational] market important: The often time-limited computer education provided in schools most often lends itself to rote memorization, creating a sort of [/wiki/Vendor_lock-in vendor lock-in] effect whereby graduates are afraid to switch to competing computer systems (&quot;Computer literacy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&quot;, 2008).

Hence, the decisions we as technology coordinators and educational technology specialists make with regard to student computer selection, as well as, application &amp; tool choices, is critical to enabling successful knowledge transfer and developing computer literate graduates.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== First row of Gurmukhi ==
The original Gurmukhi has thirty five letters and is hence called '''Penti''', literally meaning thirty five. 
Six letters have been added subsequently to represent the borrowed sounds. 
It is divided into seven rows of five letters each. 
In this chapter you will learn the letters of the first row (ਪ੍ਰਥਮ ਵਰਗ) which are

The first three letters ੳ, ਅ and ੲ, the only letters of this kind, have no sounds of their own and act as matra (vowel) carriers. Let us first study ਹ. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%;&quot;&gt;ਹ&lt;/span&gt; Haha''', the fifth letter of Gurmukhi, is pronounced the same as /h/ in English. For example, the word ''who'' will be written as ਹੂ in Gurmukhi. The matra attached with ਹ represents the /oo/ vowel as in ''boot''.  Thus we have
:ਹੂ /hoo/ = who
Now have a look at another word ''how'' which will be written in Gurmukhi as
:ਹਾ + ਉ = ਹਾਉ /hau/ = how
The matra attached with ਹ represents vowel /a/ as in /last/. The second letter of this example is &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%;&quot;&gt;ੳ&lt;/span&gt; Urha''', the first Gurmukhi letter, has no sound of its own and is used as a matra (vowel) carrier. In the above example the matra attached with ੳ represents vowel /u/ as in ''put''. Now let us learn ਸ also &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%;&quot;&gt;ਸ&lt;/span&gt; Sussa''', the fourth Gurmukhi letter, is pronounced the same as /s/ in English. If we add ਸ to ਹਾਉ  we get
:ਹਾ + ਉ + ਸ = ਹਾਉਸ /haaus/ = house
The word ''eye'' when written in Gurmukhi illustrates the remaining two letters of the first row namely &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%;&quot;&gt;ਅ&lt;/span&gt; Airha''', the second letter of Gurmukhi script and &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
'''&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%;&quot;&gt;ੲ&lt;/span&gt; Irhi''', the third letter of Gurmukhi script are both used as matra (vowel) carriers. See how ''eye'' is written in Gurmukhi
:ਆ + ਇ = ਆਇ = eye
The matra attached with ਅ represents vowel /a/ as in ''last'' and the one attached with ੲ represents vowel /i/ as in ''list''. Look at some more illustrations of the use of ਸ in transliteration of the words ''sigh'' and ''ice'' in Gurmukhi
:ਸਾ + ਇ = ਸਾਇ /sai/ = sigh
:ਆ + ਇ + ਸ = ਆਇਸ /aais/ = ice

== Exercises ==

1. Practice module, accessible from navigation menu above, has been provided to help you practice writing Gurmukhi letters. Use it to write the letters of the first row in your note book as many times as you may feel comfortable. You can click one of the letters below to go to see its animation.

== What is Ergativity? ==

=== Subjects and Objects ===

In English, we're used to talking about the subject and object of a sentence. In fact, almost every language in the Indo-European language family uses this mechanism in its syntax. Consider the sentence:

 The student studied the Sumerian tablet.

The subject, in English anyway, comes just before the verb, and the object after. So here we have ''the student'' as our subject, and ''the Sumerian tablet'' as our object.

Only slightly more complicated is the distinction between direct and indirect objects. Consider the sentence:

 The student gave the curator a Sumerian tablet.

Here, as before, our subject ''the student'' lies in front of the verb. But now, we have two noun phrases after the verb: ''the curator'' and ''a Sumerian tablet''. In English, we call ''a Sumerian tablet'' the direct object (here, the object actually being given) and we call ''the curator'' the indirect object.

Hopefully you're familiar with these terms. If you're not, you can brush up with any decent English grammar or linguistic introductory text that focuses on English.

=== Transitive vs Intransitive ===

But there are other types of sentences too, ones that have no object at all. These types of sentences are called &quot;intransitive&quot;, and sentences with objects are called &quot;transitive&quot;. Consider the intransitive sentence:

 The student napped.

We don't need anything after ''napped'', as we did before with ''gave''. These types of sentences are equally common in English. Again, though, we call the noun phrase before the verb the subject.

=== Agents and Patients ===

Ergative languages, in contrast, have another way to mark these roles in a sentence. They use &quot;agents&quot; and &quot;patients&quot; instead of subjects and objects. Consider, for instance, the transitive sentence:

 The curator woke up the student.

In ergative terms, ''the curator'' is the agent of this sentence - the one doing the action. Also, ''the student'' is called the patient - the one to whom the action is being done.

So what happens in intransitive sentences? Let's take a look at the sentence:

 The student awoke.

Here, ''the student'' is the one to whom the awakening is happening - and so we would assign the syntactic role of patient to this noun phrase.

So we can see how the &quot;subject&quot; in English becomes the &quot;agent&quot; of a transitive sentence, but the &quot;patient&quot; of an intransitive sentence! It's all in your perspective, I guess.

== How does Sumerian use Ergativity? ==

=== Split Ergativity ===

As it turns out, quite a few languages use ergativity. However, it's extremely uncommon for a language to be completely ergative. Sumerian, like most languages with ergative features, is actually &quot;split-ergative&quot;, meaning that sometimes Sumerian uses ergative cases, and sometimes it uses the familiar &quot;subject/object&quot; cases.

We'll get into more detail in later lessons about when Sumerian uses the subject/object case system, but for now, we're just going to focus on the ergative aspects of the language.

=== Case Markers ===

==== A transitive example ====

As it turns out, we've already seen the case markers for the ergative cases, both in lesson three and in lesson six. Let's look at our example sentence from lesson six again, from &quot;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.1.1.4&amp;display=Crit&amp;charenc=gcirc# Enki's journey to Nibru]&quot;:

 '''{{H:title|Eridug, a city in ancient Sumer|Eridug}}.{{H:title|.a, the locative case marker|a}} {{H:title|house, temple|e.Ø}} {{H:title|riverbank|gu}}.{{H:title|.a, the locative case marker|a}} {{H:title|bi., the locative verbal cross-reference|bi}}.{{H:title|.n., 3rd sg animate agent marker|n}}.{{H:title|to build|du}}'''

In this sentence, the temple ('''e''') is the thing being built, our patient. We see that the '''.Ø''' marker is used for the absolutive case. Remember, since this is a transitive sentence, the object of action is called the patient, and the case used is called the absolutive case.

Note, however, that the agent in this sentence is implicit - since we don't know ''who'' exactly the agent is, we just translate the subject into English as &quot;he&quot;. In this sentence, we have no noun phrases marked in the ergative case. Below, we'll take a look at a sentence that has an explicit marker.

==== An intransitive example ====

Let's also look at an intransitive sentence, from &quot;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.1.2.1&amp;display=Crit&amp;charenc=gcirc# Enlil and Ninlil]&quot; (ETCSL number 1.2.1.91):

 '''{{H:title|Enlil, a deity|Enlil}} {{H:title|i., default finite-aspect marker|i}}.{{H:title|to go|ĝen}}'''

We begin, as always, by analyzing our phrases. First up is the name '''Enlil''', who was a deity in Sumerian lore. This phrase is unmarked, leading us to guess that it is actually in the absolutive case.

Our final phrase is the verb chain. The root of the chain is '''ĝen''', meaning ''to go'' or ''to travel''. '''i.''' at the front is just a filler vowel that Sumerian uses if a verb has no other markings, but we want to put it in the &quot;finite aspect&quot; (which you can think of as past tense). So we translate this verb simply as

 Enlil went.

Couldn't be simpler! Now, '''Enlil''' being the subject of an intransitive verb, we can confirm our suspicions that it was indeed in the absolutive case, and hence unmarked.

==== An example with the ergative case marker ====

So far we haven't run into the ergative case marker, only the absolutive. That's because our sentences that had ergative subjects have all lacked explicit subjects to this point. Let's look at the following example, from &quot;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.2.2.2&amp;display=Crit&amp;charenc=gcirc# The Lament for Urim]&quot; (ETCSL reference 2.2.2.172):

 '''{{H:title|Enlil, a deity|Enlil}}.{{H:title|.e, the ergative case marker|e}} {{H:title|storm|ud}}.{{H:title|.e, the ablative case marker|e}} {{H:title|voice|gu}} {{H:title|ba., involvement indicator|ba}}.{{H:title|.n., 3rd sg animate agent marker|n}}.{{H:title|to pour|de}}'''

By now you know that the first thing to do is to analyze our phrases.

First up is '''Enlil.e'''. As you probably guessed, the '''.e''' is our elusive ergative marker! It's attached to the name '''Enlil''', which we've seen before, and is the name of an important Sumerian deity. So we find that this phrase marks Enlil as the agent of the sentence.

Next up is '''ud.e'''. The base noun here, '''ud''', means ''storm''. And just like in the first phrase, we have a '''.e''' case marker. Now, it's unlikely that we have another phrase in the ergative case - but it turns out that the terminative case also uses '''.e''' as a marker! Ambiguity can arise when analyzing cases, so usually you just make a best guess and see from context if your guesses hold up. For now, let's guess that we translate this phrase as ''to the storm''.

An interesting feature of this sentence is that the verb here is actually a two-word mash-up! This is really common in Sumerian - many different concepts can be described by combining several smaller concepts. In this case, '''gu''' is a noun meaning ''voice'', and '''de''' is our root verb meaning ''to pour''. So our verb means something like ''to pour the voice''. If you are starting to think like a Sumerian, you're probably thinking that this could translate best as ''to speak''. In fact, that's how Sumerologists read this verb in most texts! Occasionally, the translation might work better in english as ''to call'' or ''to tell'', but you get the idea.

Now let's look at the verb chain proper. As we just noted, the root verb is '''gu ... de''' meaning ''to speak''. We see our familiar friend '''.n.''' just before the root, and we remember seeing that before as the (third-person singular inanimate) cross-reference for the agent of a transitive verb. And just before that, we see '''ba.'''. This one is new, and means something like &quot;the interests of the subject are immediately affected&quot;. While you might find it odd that Sumerian has a verbal prefix expressing such a concept, to Sumerians, it was completely natural. However, in translation, we usually ignore this in the English. So we can translate this verb roughly as ''spoke'', but with this extra meaning on top.

Putting it all together, we translate this sentence as:

 Enlil spoke to the storm.

I love Sumerian literature. It really uses anthropomorphism in wonderful ways! But more importantly, we see here that we can be pretty sure that we guessed right in our assignment of the ergative and terminative case markers.

=== Verbal Chain Cross-References ===

As we've already noticed, Sumerian verb chains have markers cross-referencing ergative and absolutive elements of a sentence, when present. This is no different that a verb in any of the other cases - if we had a noun phrase in the ablative case, we'd expect to see the ablative cross-reference marker in the verb chain.

So far, though, the only markers we've seen are the '''.n.''' prefixed just before the verbal root, signifying that the patient was third-person singular inanimate, and the '''.Ø''' after the verbal root, signifying that the agent was third-person singular animate.

Obviously, there are markers for all the different persons and pluralities, but we'll get to those in later lessons.

== Quick Quiz ==

Okay, now that you've got the basics of ergativity, consider the following sentence, from &quot;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.1.4.3&amp;display=Crit&amp;charenc=gcirc# Dumuzid's dream]&quot; (ETCSL reference 1.4.3.18):

 '''{{H:title|eye|igi}}.{{H:title|.ani, 3rd sg. animate possessive particle|ani}} {{H:title|hand|cu}} {{H:title|bi., perfect aspect marker|bi}}.{{H:title|.n., 3rd sg animate agent marker|n}}.{{H:title|to seek|kij}}'''

First, let's get some vocabulary.

=== Quiz Vocabulary ===

* '''igi''' = ''eye''
* '''cu''' = ''hand''
* '''kij''' = ''to seek''

=== Quiz Analysis ===

We start by analyzing our first noun phrase, '''igi.ani'''. We know that '''igi''' means ''eye''. Remember lesson two, possessives? Look back at the table and see if you can figure out what '''.ani''' means, and hence what the whole noun phrase means.

Next, we see that we have a noun, '''cu''', and a verb '''kij'''. Sumerian, as we have already learned, has a lot of multiword verbs, and this is no exception! Here, literal translation gives us ''to seek with the hand''. A little creativity, and we realize that in Sumerian, this is an idiom that means ''to rub''. Pretty neat, eh? So really, we can add the following multiword verb to our vocabulary:

* '''cu ... kij''' = ''to rub''

Now, let's tackle our verb chain. As usual, we see a '''.n.''' just before the verbal root. Do you remember what this means? If not, look back at the example sentence in lesson six to refresh your memory.

Also, we start the verbal chain with the '''bi.''' particle. We saw that already in this lesson - see if you can remember what it means.

=== Quiz Answers ===

For convenience, I've put the meaning of each phrase in the hovertext in the following sentence. Once you have figured out what your phrases mean, you can check here.

 '''{{H:title|his eye|igi.ani}} {{H:title|he rubbed|cu bi.n.kij}}'''

How did you do? Excellent, I'm sure! At this point, I'm sure you can supply the meaning of the entire sentence given the individual phrases. Now you're really reading Sumerian!

      <comment>/* Two Forms */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Now that you've decided to take the AP Computer Science exam and prepare for it, it's important to learn more about the test.

== Two Forms ==
&lt;s&gt;There are currently two forms of the exam.  The AP Computer Science A exam covers the knowledge required for the first semester of a college-level computer science course.  The AP Computer Science AB exam, on the other hand, is more in-depth in content, and covers the knowledge required for the first year, or two semesters, of computer science.  There are currently plans to merge the two exams.  The AP Computer Science AB Exam will be discontinued following the May 2009 exam administration, and May 2009 will be the last offering of the AP Computer Science AB Exam.
&lt;/s&gt;

There is now only one form of the exam; AP Computer Science A.

== Exam Format ==
The AP Computer Science exam is administered in two parts: a multiple choice section and a free response section.  The first section has 40 multiple-choice questions, to be answered in minutes.  Because this section is multiple-choice, no partial credit is given for wrong answers.  The second section gives a set of four free-response questions, each having multiple parts.  Each question will give you the code for part of a program, leaving space for additional code, and each part of the question will give you instructions for what code you should write to fill the spaces left in the original program.  Partial credit is given for wrong attempts and incomplete answers on this section

== Scoring ==
The multiple-choice and free-response sections are each scored separately.  The free-response section is given a weighted value, and both are added together to provide a raw score.  This score is then compared to other scores, and a final scaled score is given between 1 and 5, with 5 being the best score.  Generally, most colleges in the United States will accept a 3 as a passing score for college credit, roughly equivalent to a &quot;C&quot; on the A-F grading scale.  Some schools may require a &quot;4&quot;, roughly equivalent to a &quot;B&quot;, and the most competitive universities in the nation will only accept a &quot;5&quot;, roughly equivalent to an &quot;A&quot;.  Many schools who do not offer college credit may offer accelerated or advance placement in college-level courses for those who have taken the exam.

      <comment>&quot;If you want to import every class or most classes in a single package&quot; - this was originally flipped and didn't make sense.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This will provide a basic overview of the usage of packages and classes in the Java programming language.

== Packages and Classes ==
A '''class''' groups together the related code belonging to a single program.  A class is generally made of a group of '''methods''', or groups of code that tell the computer what to do when they are '''called''', or used.  Classes can be related to each other and be used with each other, but some classes can stand alone.  Java provides many classes that are created in advance, but the typical Java program relies on user-defined classes.  These classes have objects, which interact with each other and those from Java class '''libraries'''.

Related Java classes are grouped together into '''packages'''.  Many packages are provided with the Java '''compiler''', which turns the code into executable programs.  You can put your classes together into your own package, but this will not be tested on the exam.

The package &lt;tt&gt;java.lang&lt;/tt&gt; contains the most commonly used classes in Java programming, and is automatically provided to all programs.  If you need to use any other classes, you must '''import''' them into you program by placing an &lt;tt&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; statement in your program.  For example, to import a class called &lt;tt&gt;ClassName&lt;/tt&gt; from a package called &lt;tt&gt;packagename&lt;/tt&gt;, use the following &lt;tt&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; statement:
&lt;pre&gt;import packagename.ClassName;&lt;/pre&gt;
Java has a hierarchy of packages and '''subpackages''' which are smaller groups of classes grouped together in a package.  Sometimes you will need to import a class from within a subpackage.  To import a class called &lt;tt&gt;ClassName&lt;/tt&gt; from subpackage called &lt;tt&gt;subpackagename&lt;/tt&gt; from a package called &lt;tt&gt;packagename&lt;/tt&gt;, use the following &lt;tt&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; statement:
&lt;pre&gt;import packagename.subpackagename.ClassName;&lt;/pre&gt;
If you want to import every class or most classes in a single package, there is no need to make a long list of import statements! Instead, you can simply import every class in a package using a simple &lt;tt&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; statement by using the asterisk or &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; in the statement.  For example, to import every class in the package &lt;tt&gt;packagename&lt;/tt&gt;, use the following &lt;tt&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; statement:
&lt;pre&gt;import packagename.*;&lt;/pre&gt;
This does not, however, import any subpackage included in the package, or any class included in the subpackages!  To import all of the classes in a subpackage called &lt;tt&gt;subpackagename&lt;/tt&gt; from a package called &lt;tt&gt;packagename&lt;/tt&gt;, use the following &lt;tt&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; statement:
&lt;pre&gt;import packagename.subpackagename.*;&lt;/pre&gt;
The &lt;tt&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; statement allows you to use the objects and methods defined within the packages and/or classes that are imported.  While you will neither be required to know about packages nor write &lt;tt&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; statements on the exam, it is important to know about them and how to use them when you practice writing code because unlike the AP exam, your computer will not import any required packages for you!

== All books? ==

Is there a category containing all books without subcategorising? I am trying too see approximately how many books there are and using the using [[:Category:Alphabetical]] I have to add all page counts, if there is a single category I could just look up &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGESINCATEGORY:Allbooks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. /[[Special:Contributions/90.229.131.75|90.229.131.75]] ([[User talk:90.229.131.75|talk]]) 15:40, 6 July 2008 (UTC)

: No there isn't. I made {{tlx|NUMBEROFBOOKS}} a bit ago, which adds up all the alphabetical pages. According to it there are {{NUMBEROFBOOKS}} books on WB that are properly categorized at least. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:00, 6 July 2008 (UTC)

::That template that darklama mentioned is helpful but is suspect. It only counts books which are tagged (and tagged properly) with {{tlx|Alphabetical}}. I was able to tag some books automatically using my bot, but I used the list of books on the various bookshelves, and they are terribly incomplete too. I would not be surprised to hear that the number of books here on Wikibooks (for various definitions of the word &quot;book&quot;) is closer to 2500-3000. What would be awesome is if we had a way to find and tag all the &quot;missing&quot; books. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:13, 7 July 2008 (UTC)
:::I think due to it's continued growth of uncategorised pages this want's to be resolved in some way. I estimate about 2000 uncategorised pages have been added this year alone. Perhaps a bot could go through them and put some template on them to get them appropriately categorised? [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 16:19, 10 July 2008 (UTC)
:::: A bot fix is not inconceivable. However, adding all currently un-categorized pages to a single generic &quot;uncategorized&quot; category doesn't help anybody, and simply duplicates effort that the software already performs. A good bot would probably follow these basic rules, if it wants to be worthwhile:
::::#For toplevel pages such as &quot;Bookname&quot;, add {{tlx|Alphabetical}} (with the first letter of the book name) and {{tlx|Subject}} (possibly with no arguments immediately). Also, add it to &quot;Category:Bookname&quot;
::::#For subpages such as &quot;Bookname/Pagename&quot;, add them to &quot;Category:Bookname&quot;. Notice that this is done automatically with the {{tlx|BookCat}} template.
::::#Pages in other namespaces get dealt with differently. Talk pages should not be categorized. Pages in &quot;Cookbook:&quot; should have special cookbook-specific templates added. Pages in &quot;Wikijunior:&quot; should probably be treated similarly to points 1 and 2 above, except the main pages of the books should also be added to &quot;Category:Wikijunior&quot;. 
::::This is a pretty big job, and one that we should not just throw together. We should spend some time talking about what, exactly, we want to have happen. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:06, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

== Book on Mathematical Physics ==

I am frankly astounded that Wikibooks neither has a book nor a request for a book on this topic. In my opinion, an undergraduate text on mathematical methods is invaluable before going to standard books on advanced physics (including some of our own: [[Quantum Mechanics]], [[General Relativity]], [[Statistical Mechanics]] etc.). I plan to start a book about general mathematical methods (I've just had a course on it). I'd like to invite specific guidance or help in contribution.

== References ==

I notice almost none of the Wikibooks have a reference to it's content, including [[Wikibooks:Featured_books|Featured books]]. I'm assuming there is no requirement to reference material on wikibooks. Is that correct, has the issue been discussed somewhere. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 16:15, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

:Although I am not 100%(so if someone is, correct me if I'm wrong), I do not believe there is any specific policy regarding as to if there need to be references or not. However, as you may notice, it is not common to cite reference in the manner in which Wikipedia does. It is more common to have something like this. [[Dutch Empire/Contents/Bibliography]] A different section of the book to list your source. This example is from a book I wrote. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 18:19, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

::I think Wikibooks is getting to a point where not just quantity of material but now ''quality'' of it should be a large motivational concern. We have plenty of books, plenty of featured books, and now we should be standardizing things like references to help improve overall quality. A policy (or, better yet, a guideline) on this topic might be invaluable to help us move forward in this area. PErhaps we should draft one? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:34, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

:::I wouldn't object to the idea. I don't believe it would be best to have it orginized like wikipedia(citations on the page and ref section at the bottom), but more along the lines of a regular book, such as I did with the [[Dutch Empire]]. As for the specifics, well, if we do this we'll get to that later. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 03:25, 11 July 2008 (UTC)

:::Quality is indeed often quite dysmal, especially in the language books section, which I like to contribute to. However, for the quality of textbooks I believe that references are not as invaluable as they are on Wikipedia, because books will rarely contain the latest (or contested) findings. I don't need to cite anything to prove that &quot;Hello&quot; is &quot;Salut&quot; in French, or even that titles (like &quot;Mr. General Director of Sales&quot;) play a more important role in France than in the USA. I can base that on my personal knowledge, as long as nobody contests it. What is really needed to improve Wikibooks are ways to make contributors continue working on courses rather than leaving abruptly, and ways to make them plan better, i. e. not writing any course without first defining goal/scope, target audience, methodology used and lesson plan / curriculum. With these things specified, the development of a course will go more smoothly, conflicts can be avoided and the book won't fall into decay once the original contributor leaves. Also, there have been issues where these pages existed but weren't read by new contributors, so we should probably find a way to include them prominently somewhere and/or to link to them on the edit page itself (not to mention linking to the Wikibook on how to write a good course). Anyway, does anybody want to discuss how to achieve this? Right now I can only think of one thing: creating templates for links to these course development pages and also templates for missing development pages, e. g. &quot;This course is missing a lesson plan&quot;. [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] ([[User talk:Junesun|talk]]) 13:44, 11 July 2008 (UTC)

::::Naturally it would be ridiculous to have to cite the words &quot;Salut&quot; or &quot;Hola&quot;. As said though, I think we should encourage people to list where they have gotten their information from. I'm not really sure what we can do to encourage people to stay longer and not leave halfway through, although that is a big problem. A template is a start, but I think we would need something else, although I'm not sure what. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 14:23, 12 July 2008 (UTC)

::::Establishing a guideline for all subject areas would be tricky and possibly too voulmnious to be of much practical use because the content areas each have specific requirements that vary. If I contribute to a field like literary criticism, let's say, do I really need the ins and outs of citing words introduced in language textbooks, or to know how to use tables to show results of experiments performed in natural sciences to support hypotheses that are being tested? To be useful, I think an overall guideline for all areas would be short and very general. Then, you would need more specific guidelines for various content areas. Quite a challenge! [[User:DanQuigley|DanQuigley]] ([[User talk:DanQuigley|talk]]) 18:05, 12 July 2008 (UTC)

I don't think a guideline is necessary. This seems more like a FAQ to me. Perhaps [[Help:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] would be a good place to mention it. Something simple as &quot;Q: How do I cite sources or include references? A: Most books if they cite sources at all gather all citation references in a single biographical type page, similar to what is commonly done in dead-tree books.&quot; --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:38, 12 July 2008 (UTC)
:That seems a good idea to me Darklama. It would be good to advise adding references as you go along or even before the book is done, that way you reduce the issue of people leaving. Also link to an example. Do we have a good example? [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 10:51, 14 July 2008 (UTC)

== Someone with administrative power? ==

Is there anyone at Wikibooks that has administrative power over content of books?
I have a suggestion regarding a book called &quot;Marksmanship&quot; and would like to
have someone with administrative power other than the originator of the book to see and comment on my suggestion. You will find a copy of my comment I posted with the book below:

I agree with the opening statement at the top 100% and it angers me that a book titled &quot;Marksmanship&quot; includes facsimiles of the human form as targets. Incuding being exceedingly distasteful, there are ethical, psychological and legal issues that make the use of the human form as a shooting target dangerous. 
To begin with those who oppose the non-military/non-police use of firearms can use this book as an argument against those who legally use firearms for other purposes therefore supporting their arguments. I am suspicious of the person who has published these targets in this book for that reason and the others you will find below. The purpose of using the human form as a target is to desensitize people to make it easier for them to shoot and possibly kill other humans. I have no intention of ever killing another human, so do not even like seeing a target of the human form. There have been court cases and legal precedents regarding practising shooting on targets representing the human form where premeditation of murder was proven based on this. A case could be make of premeditated murder or attempted murder if there was say, a shooting accident and the defendant had at some time practised shooting at a human form target. I once had a police officer attempt to gift me some human silhouette targets. He had a reputation of being shady.
I would like the original contributor to remove the human silhouette targets from the book and replace them with types of targets that were more traditionally used by marksmen or to be more PC &quot;sharpshooters&quot;.

Thanks in advance for your attention.

== Bot request ==

I while back I was working on [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Birds]] and created several subpages that I then transcluded.  Each of these pages have the prefix [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixIndex&amp;from=Adventist+Youth+Honors+Answer+Book%2FNature%2FBirds%2F&amp;namespace=0 Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Birds/] (note trailing slash).  After working with it for a while, I realized that it was far beyond the scope of a single chapter, so I added them to [[Field Guide/Birds]] which has a couple of sub pages which link back to the originals.  I would like to remove my original tentacles.  I started doing this by hand, but it's quite tedious. To further complicate matters, I feel that the pages should be named according to the bird's latin name rather than its common name.  Fortunately, each page uses a template that includes latin_name as an argument. 

Long story short, I would like to have the remaining several pages moved to [[Field Guide/Birds/latin_name_of_bird]].  Then edit all the pages that link to it (there may be more than one, such as [[Field Guide/Birds - Eastern US and Canada]] and [[Field Guide/Birds - Western US and Canada]].  Most - if not all - of these also have pages in Transwiki space from where I imported the base info from WP.  The transwiki pages should prolly be deleted, and finally, the original page should be deleted too.

To summarize:
* move [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Birds/common name]] → [[Field Guide/Birds/Latin_name]]
* edit all pages that include the original, except the one in Transwiki name space
* delete the transwiki page.
* delete original (should be an orphan)

:If you want to customise the look just for yourself, you can either modify your own User:username/common.css file, or use the per-book CSS gadget - but I suspect you want to change it for all readers, in which case you will need to specify the background colours for each cell, like this:

== Five Year Anniversary ==

It is hard to believe, but the five year anniversary of Wikibooks is coming up!  On July 2003, Wikibooks was started by [[User:Karl Wick]] and a few others as a result of a Vote for Deletion on Wikipedia when a &quot;textbook&quot; about Chemistry was debated.  Going over some of those historical pages of the very first edits on this project as well as plowing through the archives of Textbook-l give some interesting insight about how crazy it was just to get this project started.

In these five years, we have seen a huge turnover in terms of participants and contributors, but through it all some amazing progress has been made.  I'd like to take this time to urge some reflection on just what has been accomplished and &quot;toot our horn&quot; as this project passes this important milestone.  With well over 1 million edits on just en.wikibooks, we've had our fair share of edit wars, wheel warring, arguments, flames, and vandalism.  We've also in spite of all of that contention some incredible books that have been written and have come through all of that discussion with a rather amazing body of literature.  

The wiki concept seems to be alive and well here, and on a personal note I'd like to thank all of those who have made donations to this project (both financial and in terms of making editorial contributions) and for the hard work that a small cadre of people have done to keep the flame alive that is Wikibooks!  This project wouldn't be what it is without you.  If you are a long time contributor or somebody new to Wikibooks, I hope that you can join with me in an amazing next five years that can only promise more and exciting things in the future.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 10:37, 27 June 2008 (UTC)
:We should perhaps think about a &quot;press release&quot; sort of thing on Foundation-l, Whiteknight's blog (etc?) and see if we can't use this milestone as an opportunity to gain some new contributors.

It would be interesting if perhaps we could come up with something a bit more up-to-date like that.  It takes quite a bit of effort to dig up even a statistical summary of significant accomplishments, much less go into issues related to project governance.  Still, it would be worthwhile to reflect back and see what has happened in the past couple of years.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 16:48, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

== Collapsible - what is possible? ==

Hello,

I'm hoping to start developing [[Calculus/Tables of Integrals]], but before I get started I have a question about the collapsible class. I spend most of my time on Wikipedia so if I'm asking this in the wrong place then a point in the right direction will be appreciated :).

Ok, some background. There are a lot of &quot;in print&quot; tables of integrals around ([http://www.amazon.com/Table-Integrals-Products-Seventh-Jeffrey/dp/0123736374/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1215869391&amp;sr=8-1 some] over a thousand pages long with tens of thousands of results), but for practical reasons none of them contain the derivations of each (or any) result. Wikipedia is starting to amass a few tables (see [[:w:Lists of integrals|Lists of integrals]]) and in some cases derivations (see [[:w:Integral of secant cubed|Integral of secant cubed]]). They're tempting additions since the Wiki software solves all the practical 'paper' problems that I mentioned above. Ultimately, they don't really belong on Wikipedia though - it's textbook stuff and should be fully fleshed out here, and so I'm hoping to get that ball rolling.

This brings me to my question. There will be a problem when it comes to readability. Some of the derivations will be painfully long, and others so simple they won't generally be worth looking at. I'm hoping it's possible to set up a collapsible 'class' (or something similar) that lets people add an integral, so the integral sits left aligned on the page, and a ''show/hide derivation'' button (right aligned) that readers can click if they want to. Most readers will simply want a particular result, so the default value should be 'hidden', allowing readers to quickly scan the results to find what they're looking for. On occasion, readers may want to see how a result is derived. There may even be more than one derivation. Some users will be able to contribute results but not the derivation, so a template message could be developed asking for someone else to add the derivation and placed in this hidden area. In other cases, derivations have references in journal articles that people might find interesting or helpful. Maybe there could be interwiki or crosswiki links too.

I can't think of a way of doing this with a template (would it even be possible? I believe all the collapsible stuff is tucked away in [[MediaWiki:Common.js]]), but my template experience is next to nil so maybe I'm overlooking an obvious way to do this. Any help would be appreciated. Cheers, [[User:Ben Tillman|Ben Tillman]] ([[User talk:Ben Tillman|talk]]) 13:46, 12 July 2008 (UTC)

:We do have a template {{tlx|Dynamic navigation}} that collapses and expands when clicked on. I don't know if you want something more general or flexible then that, maybe you could ask [[User:Darklama]] (he created that template and is the resident expert on it). For most derivations, maybe you should consider creating sub-pages to host them, instead of trying to keep things inline. If you put the derivation on a separate page, you can transclude it to a main page with many derivations. You have lots of options here. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:40, 13 July 2008 (UTC)
::I thought about subpages, but as the number of integrals grows, certain classes of integrals may need to be shifted off onto their own separate pages, and so on. I thought it might get a bit messy that way. The dynamic navigation template looks great though, so I'll have a chat to Darklama. Thanks for your help.

== Question about the tone of writing in a Wikibook ==

Hello!  I'm literally brand new to the Wikibooks community, and of course I got started in the logical place to start - [[Using Wikibooks]].  As I was working my way through, I noticed that certain sections (notably [[Using Wikibooks/The Wikibooks Editor/Advanced Techniques|Advanced Techniques]]) had a very casual tone.  I'm used to Wikipedia, admittedly, and I know I shouldn't apply my understandings of style from different projects, but I'm wondering if it's appropriate to edit for style, or if that would be considered bad faith/vandalism.  The last thing I want to do is start off on the wrong foot.

Thank you for your help! [[User:Keakealani|Keakealani]] ([[User talk:Keakealani|talk]]) 01:12, 31 July 2008 (UTC)

: Wikibooks includes many separate works, unlike Wikipedia where every article can be considered part of a single work. The import thing is for the style to be consistent within a single book. A casual tone is fine, and may help the audience the book is aimed for to not feel overwhelmed or intimidated when learning the subject for instance. You may find [[Help:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] a bit helpful in understanding some of the differences between Wikibooks and Wikipedia. I recommend getting a feel for the overall style of the book first. If you still feel it could be improved, [[WB:BOLD|be bold]] and do so, or discussion it with other book contributors, depending on how conferable you feel. The worst that could happen is you end up having to discuss the style of the book with other contributors anyways. Depending on how drastically you want to change the style you might want to discuss it first anyways. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:37, 31 July 2008 (UTC)

I don't want to step over toes or make the book seem too encyclopedic, but at the same time, sometimes I feel like referring to specific things as &quot;stuff&quot; might just be confusing... At any rate, I'll probably read those articles, make a couple specific changes, and address any other problems on the discussion page, and I think it's all good.

== My thoughts on Wikibooks ==

===Why aren't we more popular?===
Wikis are good for collaborative, standardizable projects, like encyclopedias and software manuals. However, textbooks are more individualized. From what I've seen, good books usually have at most a dozen significant contributors, although the number is often significantly less. For example, the [[Formal Logic]] book is largely the work of [[user:JMRyan]], and [[New Zealand History]] by [[User:Helpfulstuffnz]]. A notable exception is the [[Cookbook]], due to its modular structure.

In an encyclopedia, there is one &quot;best&quot; way to convey information. In a textbook, the presentation depends on the audience. Hence many books will overlap the same material, but teach in a different way, leading to what could be interpreted as wasted effort. A good example of this is the [[Wikibooks:Mathematics_bookshelf|Mathematics bookshelf.]]

Textbooks also require much more in terms of graphics. Encyclopedias are meant for reference, not for learning. Because of this, they only include a picture if it is noteworthy. A textbook, on the other hand, are made to teach people something that they don't yet know, and quite often diagrams and pictures are necessary for retention of information.

Another problem with Wikibooks is the lack of a uniform goal. WikiHow is very organized and easy to browse, and has a clear &quot;how-to&quot; theme. Wikibooks, on the other hand, is a mess.

The sad truth in my opinion is, most Wikibooks are mediocre at best at teaching what they're supposed to, and there are usually other websites that are more comprehensive, and when necessary, more personal.

In other words, I pretty much agree with [[w:Wikibooks#Criticisms]].
&lt;br&gt;
:I'm not familiar with wikis so apologies if there are formatting shortcomings but I think I might have an answer to your question and that's in the lack of the definition of the target user.

:Who is it that's supposed to grab an open source textbook and use it? Not students, they get the textbook they're told to get or are handed. &lt;i&gt;Generally&lt;/i&gt;, it won't be teachers who decide which textbook to use. Teachers are too low on the hierarchy to make what, in the selection of a textbook, would be a policy decision. In most schools the decision's made higher up the hierarchy by administrative or elective persons. If you'll grant that I'm correct, how are these people being made aware of open source textbooks?

:But the lack of awareness of the existence of open source textbooks by the people who run public education is only one problem and not, I feel, the most important problem.

:The inescapably political nature of the management of public education creates barriers to open source textbooks which have nothing to do with the quality, or lack, of the textbooks. Without getting into the merits of the demands of competing interest groups on textbook publishers and textbook selection committees just the fact that there are competing demands has an inevitable erosive effect on the educational value of the textbook. Commercial publishers will accommodate those often conflicting demands by producing an educationally inferior but politically acceptable textbook. Since I very much doubt that the authors of open source textbooks are willing to accommodate those demands, were they even in a position to do so, the bulk of the public education market is off limits.

:So, in a couple of paragraphs I've disposed of students, teachers and public schools as possible &quot;customers&quot; for open source textbooks. Does that leave anyone/anything? Yes, I believe it does. I believe there are several worthwhile markets for open source textbooks.

:One worthwhile market may be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_school public charter schools]. While they are public schools in every sense of the word they enjoy a great deal more autonomy then schools which are part of a school district. They develop their own policies and to a considerable extent, go their own way within the legal requirements set forth in law. That independence alone provides an opening for open source textbooks.

:Sorry, I just noticed the extent to which I've warmed up to one of my favorites subjects so I'll try to wrap things up. 

:The reason you aren't more popular is that you represent a pretty peculiar breed; people who are willing to put a great deal of time in on a project which doesn't appear have much chance of ever being put to use. In the public education system open source textbooks are an order of magnitude less well know then open source software which is only now starting to make inroads against commercial software. So other then the rare exception you won't see open source textbooks being used in the public education system. The only motivation in that circumstance is purely internal - the hope that someday open source textbooks will be put to use. That sort of faith just isn't a common commodity.

:I'll finish with what I believe is the other viable customer for open source textbooks: private schools for lower-income families. More common then is generally suspected in the U.S., much more common then is realized in the [http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_16/c3677155.htm &quot;poor nations&quot;] of the world. [[User:Allen majorovic|Allen majorovic]] ([[User talk:Allen majorovic|talk]])

===What can we do about it?===
*Add the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wikibooks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template to corresponding Wikipedia articles. This is probably the easiest thing to do, and I've already done it a few times.
*Know our audience. I doubt that many people who want to learn [[Arithmetic]] know about Wikibooks, let alone Wikipedia.
*Make it easier to create print versions. I'm no PHP/Mediawiki/PDF expert, so I don't know how this could be done.
*Use Bittorrent to distribute PDFs of featured books. Most BT users use it for movies and TV shows, but a decent amount (which includes me) use it for e-books.
*Get other websites to link to and collaborate with us, e.g., what [http://www.blender.org/education-help/tutorials/getting-started/ Blender] has already done.
*Get hitcounts for WikiBooks pages; not just overall edits, surfers too.   Writers like their work to be read, or is that too obvious?  [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]])

A large part is few visitors, because search engines show few wikibooks pages high. There are some ways to boast your profile in Google and other search engines.
:A simple way would be to remove the wording from the title in every book '- Wikibooks, collection of open-content textbooks'.
:Have more links from appropriate articles on Wikipedia
:Another would be to submit more books(perhaps every Featured book?) to [http://www.dmoz.org/ DMOZ].
: There is some more [[W:Search engine optimization|Optimization for Search Engines]] type things you could do but the above three would be a great help.  [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 12:49, 13 July 2008 (UTC)

===What things can we do that are less likely to succeed?===
*Make free, open-source projects in general more mainstream. Most people won't go through the effort of finding a GDFL-compatible license or fair use rationale just to upload a picture on Wikimedia Commons. Also, most computer users don't care what the EULA of their product says, just as long as it works. Mention GDFL and Creative Commons and they'll look at you like the geek you probably are. =)
*Recruit people on forums to work on specific Wikibooks. I already tried this with the [[College Guide]], but it didn't work.

=== Comments ===

* I agree that books need more graphics. Wikibooks also needs more motivated artists to make relevant illustrations, diagrams, figures, etc. I encourage you to add images to books.
* A book's scope, depth, audience, and presentation should be different enough to avoid material overlap. These things should probably be made more clearer in more books, just as more books need to use more graphics. A neutral audience and presentation would be difficult, if not impossible, to do without leaving some people needing to turn to other sources for books.
* Wikibooks has a uniform goal: &quot;to write free open textbooks&quot;. I think the problem is that not enough people outside of the project understand Wikibooks' goals. This is reflected in how often Wikipedians use Wikibooks as a dumping ground for there unwanted materials for instance.
* I have at times used the wikibooks template on wikipedia pages as well. One thing to consider is sometimes people also remove them, because some consider it spam, advertising, etc.
* In order to know our audience, Wikibooks would need more readers to provide feedback. The sad fact is currently only even a minority of contributors, contribute to discussions such as this. Most people focus on there individual books, giving the impression that only a minority of people are really all that interested in any bigger picture.
* I think there is some work already to make it easier to generate print versions of books. If you have some ideas on this or any other ideas for improving the software for Wikibooks, I encourage you (and everyone else for that matter) to contribute your ideas to [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Feature requests]].
* Anyone can redistribute books found here. To make books available by bittorrent it only takes people willing to make the books available by bittorrent. The same is true for making books available by any other methods or means. If there not available its because there isn't anyone willing to do it. I encourage you to make books available by bittorrent if that is what you want.

* I agree that it would be good if more websites linked to us and more people used Wikibooks for there collaboration needs. I think some of this goes back to not understanding Wikibooks' goals and scope. Wikibooks gets some book donations and sometimes people do decide Wikibooks best meets there needs. Perhaps you could help improve [[Help:Contributing|Help:Why contribute?]], help to do something to make pages like that more known, and help encourage any websites you know of that would be interested in books here, to link to Wikibooks.
* Recruitment isn't easy as you and I have both experienced. In my case the feeling from people was that it is much more rewarding to contribute to short one page articles, tutorials, etc. that don't take a lot of time and effort. I think this goes back to knowing your audience. Its hard to go to the right places to get people interested, if you don't know what audience would be interested in Wikibooks.

All in all I think it comes down to being bold and trying to make a difference where you can. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:36, 13 June 2008 (UTC)

:This doesn't quite answer the concerns raised above, but this is my thought. I think that it is expected that Wikibooks would evolve differently from how Wikipedia has, because the nature of textbooks is different from that of encyclopedia. Textbooks are often more personal and individualistic. Even though we have the NPOV policy in Wikibooks (which is of course necessary one), the books are going to reflect inevitably the research interest and background of the authors. Since we are not here to create a new kind of textbooks, I don't think this is a problem. As to why Wikibooks isn't popular as we hoped (I don't think the project has (so far) lived up to the hype.), I would say it is too early to make a judgement. Serious books take literally years to write. (For example, writing proofs is really time-consuming even when you know the materials very well; and making sure that the ideas behind the theory develop well is a very challenging job. writing good exercising is in an order of magnitudeharder than solving them, etc.) Accordingly, the development process is probably not going to be linear. Books or parts of them may be abandoned from time to time. This need not be perceived as failure. It's just part of a process. Overall, my impression (mostly from math books) is that we are moving forward, if very slowly.

:(straying further from the main issue), to me the major problem of wikibooks isn't the contributors, the community nor the policies; but the software on which Wikibooks runs. I know I'm not the first to say this, but mediawiki, at the current state, is very ill-suited for textbook writing. Manually maintaining the books (e.g., chapters, pages, navigation stuff etc.) is just so tedious, error-prone and no fun at all. I have been witnessing a lot of time wasted on the maintenance work. This is very serious issue. My most-wished feature is a referencing mechanism across not just pages but the entire book. This is, for example, numbering theorems or adding reference to them in an automatic manner. If you know Latex, you know what I'm taking about. (Though I'm thinking if this can be achieved via templates. An alternative is to use bots or scripts.) -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] ([[User talk:TakuyaMurata|talk]]) 00:14, 14 June 2008 (UTC)

*Recently I've been tagging more articles on wikipedia with wikibook tags, but I agree with TakuyaMurata. Many books develop at an extremely slow rate, and more often than not it appears the author leaves the book half completed. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 18:39, 16 June 2008 (UTC)

* I think the end user needs to know that the information in the book is reliable.  The current system unfortunately is open to abuse either by straight sabotage, a book I was looking up a reference in had had its title / contents page edited by some one who replaced it with a rather impolite comment, or by some one not understanding the system and putting capitals on page so the links get lost.  Yes I corrected them but I don't really have time to patrol each page each day.  Once a book gets a cetain amount of work in it can it get assigned a group of people who may make corrections or approve corrections made by others?  It is of especial concern on the Trainz wiki book where we have some tutorials that say on your computer do this or that.  If the instructions are modified to say &quot;format C:&quot; then people's computers can be damaged and this is a major concern.  Perhaps wikibook without some safeguards is not appropiate for certain types of material?  JohnWhelan

== Books with only a title page ==

Given that 68% of &quot;books&quot; only have a title page or 1 page - see http://toolserver.org/~john/wikibooks-works.php - why not place all of these &quot;title page&quot; books in a separate area once they are 3 months old and delete them after 2 years?  This would help cleanup exercises because orphaned pages would disappear from books.  A new book type of &quot;pamphlet&quot; might be needed so that &quot;books&quot; that are really pamphlets are not removed.  The separate area could be called &quot;empty_books&quot;. As well as helping cleanup, this process would remove the clutter of shell's of books that put off readers of Wikibooks. Authors could find pages that have disappeared because of poor naming etc. by looking in the empty books folder (ideally a robot would remove these pages and mark linked pages with &quot;see empty_books&quot;).

:Some of them are redirects to outside projects, and could probably be deleted by now. Some of the results are due to having moved books and having left only the title page as a redirect. Some of them are due to using inconsistent names, but aren't really orphaned. Some might be due to a decision to delete a book, where someone didn't take care of the subpages too. Some of them might be duplicates that need to be merged due to copy+pasting rather then just moving the pages. Overall I don't think 68% of &quot;books&quot; consist of 1 page, but consist of problems that just need to be fixed. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:10, 15 July 2008 (UTC)

There were:

4 P pamphlets

3 O Seemed OK and were bona fide parts of larger books (misclassified by tool?)

3 E Were effectively empty. Weirdly they were all started in November 2006!

2 S were page spelling errors

1 R was a redirect

1 D was an early take on work already covered ie: should have been deleted

So 7 out of 15 were in classes (PED) which fall under my original comment (ie: about 40% of Wikibooks &quot;books&quot;). The comment still stands - what about deleting empty books after a while and having a separate category for pamphlets? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|talk]]) 10:12, 16 July 2008 (UTC)

: Wikibooks doesn't delete &quot;books&quot; simply because there stubs (&quot;empty&quot;), and Wikibooks doesn't work on a timetable. What your calling pamphlets are also considered stubs. I suggest you add {{tlx|book stub}} or {{tlx|expand}} to them if you feel like categorizing them. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:23, 16 July 2008 (UTC)
:: I think RobinH has a good point, there are a lot of pages that require some effort even if that is adding an appropriate category and 1 page books in my view require filing in some other way then being a book. There perhaps could be a systematic check through of pages and categories. Problem is it's a very big task so perhaps break it down into sections.

:::As [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) points out, 1 page books need to be seen as such by readers.  Perhaps Pamphlets could have a special symbol next to them on the Bookshelves so that potential readers can see what they are.  In a bookshop or library it is obvious when a publication is a pamphlet, we should make it obvious here.

== Standards for Box and other Margins ==

Can somebody please advise me on the following?   Are there house standards or recommendations for the padding and margins for box template making?   I mean, should margins be provided on the right and bottom or what:  Are top and left to be ignored?

== Navigation sidebar question ==

&lt;small&gt;&lt;s&gt;Hi, Is the [[MediaWiki:Sidebar|site sidebar customisation]] where the following html code comes from?

&lt;source lang=xml&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;p-Navigation&quot; class=&quot;generated-sidebar portlet&quot;&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Navigation&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;&lt;s&gt;I'm curious because I use this line in my custom js on about a dozen wiki sites:

&lt;source lang=javascript&gt;
var toolbox = document.getElementById(&quot;p-navigation&quot;);
 toolbox.innerHTML += '&lt;h5&gt;Myn knopkes&lt;/h5&gt;'+buttons;
&lt;/source&gt;

But here, I had to change it to p-Navigation. And, none of the sites where the original code works, as well as the others I happened to spot check, capitalise the word &quot;navigation.&quot; Curiously, with your customisation, I would expect to see &quot;Navigation&quot; with a capital letter on the actual sidebar. But I don't--it's lower case. 

But I could be barking up all the wrong trees here. :-) Thanks for any and all enlightenment. [[User:Snakesteuben|Snakesteuben]] ([[User talk:Snakesteuben|talk]]) 17:41, 20 July 2008 (UTC)

== New page on PHP user login systems ==

After trawling the web and finding umpteen articles/tutorials about how to build 'secure' user login systems in PHP&amp;mdash;many of which have ''huge'' security flaws&amp;mdash;I've started building a [[PHP Programming/User login systems|page]] in the [[PHP Programming]] book devoted to this topic.  However, I'm no expert, and I'm quite sure I've missed out some things (in fact, I can list a few of them...).

So, this is a call to anyone here to knows a bit about PHP (and computer security) to come and edit [[PHP Programming/User login systems|this new page]] and make it a well-written, well-researched article about how to build (actually) secure user login systems in PHP.

:Yes, for instance the C++ Programming (15 + 16 + 64 people, depending on C++, C++ Programming or TOC1 url ref.) and More C++ Idioms (saved by 158 people) have also featured on that page several times, it all depends on the number of people subscribing the same url in a given timeframe, and it's pretty common since the site permits you to subscribe to other people directly or to a given tag, so people with the same interest can share references.

== So Confused, my questions have questions - please help 1st timer! ==

After spending 90 minutes bouncing from page to page, I still do not have an understanding of what I was hoping would be a simple question. After '''discovering''' Wiki Books, I want to use the content of some to benefit the visitors of my website/blog.

My questions are:

* 1. If I copy Wiki book content verbatim and convert it to a PDF, is this allowed and what (if any) copyright or legal disclosures need to be added to the PDF document?

* 2. I would like to use information from several books, and add my own images and edit the content. 
**     A. Is this OK to do?
**     B. What copyright or &quot;author&quot; credits need to be on the new document?
**     C. Do any answers to the above questions change depending upon me making the new document available free of charge, versus for a fee?

Thanks for any help in understanding this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ltk''' is a portable set of Tk bindings for Common Lisp.  Tk is a graphical ‘toolkit’, a library that makes GUI building easier by providing widgets, i.e. graphical elements such as buttons an drop-down menus.  Tk originated and gained great popularity as part of Tcl/Tk, the dynamic Tcl language paired with the simple to use Tk toolkit.  Due to Tcl/Tk's popularity, implementations exist for most systems and Ltk is portable to any such system.

Ltk is not truly a binding in the usual sense, it is really an interface to the &lt;tt&gt;wish&lt;/tt&gt; shell, a shell that interprets commands to build a window.  This allows Ltk to operate via a simple stream of commands to an external process running &lt;tt&gt;wish&lt;/tt&gt;, rather than the linking needed in most other GUI builders.  While passing commands to the &lt;tt&gt;wish&lt;/tt&gt; interpreter may produce slower programs, it makes the Ltk package very simple to build, use, extend, and debug, and it removes the need for any FFI.  These features stand in stark contrast to most other GUI builders for Common Lisp.

== Basic Ltk ==

A program that uses Ltk to build its GUI needs three main parts.  It needs to create widgets, place the widgets on the window, and then associate actions for when the widgets are activated.  An Ltk program typically has the following basic format:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(with-ltk ()
  (let* (;; Creating widgets
         (widget1 (make-instance 'widget))
         ...more widgets... )
    ;; Associating actions with widgets
    (bind widget1 event (lambda (evt) ...do something...))
    ;; Placing widgets on the window
    (pack widget1) ))
&lt;/source&gt;

Ltk operation is based on the instantiation of CLOS objects.  To create any particular widget, you would make and instance of that class.  This instance does not need to be retained, but if it is, it can then be used to alter the properties of the widget.

Ltk includes the following common widgets:&lt;ref&gt;For the up to date and complete list of supported widgets check the &lt;code&gt;ltk.lisp&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Buttons
* Check boxes
* Radio buttons
* Text entry fields and text editor boxes
* Listboxes
* Menu bars
* Frames and scrolled frames
* Canvases and scrolled canvases

If this list seems quite short, you are not wrong.  These widgets will allow you to create many useful programs, but you will find them lacking for certain tasks (such as a progress indicator for a download).  Latter we will see how to add new widgets.

=== Laying out Widgets ===

With Ltk (as with Tk) once a widget is created, it is not visible until you tell &lt;tt&gt;wish&lt;/tt&gt; where to put it in the window.  Ltk has two geometry mangers, &lt;tt&gt;pack&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;grid&lt;/tt&gt;.  &lt;tt&gt;Pack&lt;/tt&gt; treats widgets as boxes and packs them horizontally or vertically.  &lt;tt&gt;Grid&lt;/tt&gt; lays out widgets on a regular grid.  Of the two, &lt;tt&gt;pack&lt;/tt&gt; is much more commonly used.

=== Events and Binding ===

Like most graphical interfaces, all computation in Ltk is event driven in nature.  This means that any event that happens inside your window, like a key press or a mouse click, is sent to your program by the windowing system.  Ltk then looks up what handler functions, typically defined by you, are associated with this event and calls them.  Event handlers can be established in two ways, by the &lt;tt&gt;command&lt;/tt&gt; slot in many widgets and &lt;tt&gt;bind&lt;/tt&gt; function.  The &lt;tt&gt;bind&lt;/tt&gt; function is more complex than the &lt;tt&gt;command&lt;/tt&gt; slot method, but &lt;tt&gt;bind&lt;/tt&gt; is a general and more flexible way to associate functions with events.

=== A Simple Example ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(with-ltk ()
  (let* ((button (make-instance
                   'button :text &quot;Press Me!&quot;
                   :command (lambda ()
                              (do-msg &quot;Hello World!&quot;) ))))
    (pack button :pady 30 :padx 30) ))
&lt;/source&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Placing Widgets ===

For widgets to be visible, they must be placed on the window.  This is done with one of three functions: ‘&lt;tt&gt;place&lt;/tt&gt;’, ‘&lt;tt&gt;pack&lt;/tt&gt;’, or ‘&lt;tt&gt;grid&lt;/tt&gt;’.  Each is used for different circumstances.  In some simple cases, widgets may be placed by specifying the placement method as a keyword argument to &lt;tt&gt;make-instance&lt;/tt&gt;.  We will deal with each of these methods in turn.

==== Placing Widgets ====
The most rudimentary way of placing widgets on a window is to specify an x and y position along with a width and height.  The ‘&lt;tt&gt;place&lt;/tt&gt;’ function will perform this task for you.  However, this is typically harder than it needs to be (compared to the methods we will explore next) so its use is not advised for any purpose.
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(with-ltk ()
  (let ((button (make-instance 'button :text &quot;A Button&quot;)))
    ;; Place BUTTON at x=50, y=40
    (place button 50 40 :width 100 :height 50) ))
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Pack Geometry ====

==== Grid Geometry ====
Here is a mock up of the video game [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game) Lights Out].  We use the &lt;tt&gt;grid&lt;/tt&gt; geometry manager to assemble an NxM array of buttons where each button is either ‘on’ or ‘off’.  For simplicity sake we will represent on by an ‘X’ and off by no text.  Whenever you click a button, it toggles the button and the four adjacent buttons between the blank and ‘X’ state.  The goal is to change all of the buttons to blanks.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defun button-on? (button)
  &quot;Tell me if the button is 'on' or not.&quot;
  (equal (text button) &quot;X&quot;) )

(defun toggle-button (b)
  &quot;Toggle one button from an X to a Space or a Space to an X.&quot;
  (if (button-on? b)
      ;; To change a widget's text, ltk doesn't use CONFIGURE, but
      ;; instead you just SETF the text
      (setf (text b) &quot; &quot;)
      (setf (text b) &quot;X&quot;) ))

(defun toggle-block (buttons i j n m)
  &quot;Change the button, and the buttons neighboring it \(if they are in
bounds).&quot;
  (toggle-button (aref buttons i j))
  (when (&lt; (1+ i) n) (toggle-button (aref buttons (1+ i) j)))
  (when (&lt; (1+ j) m) (toggle-button (aref buttons i (1+ j))))
  (when (&gt;= (1- i) 0) (toggle-button (aref buttons (1- i) j)))
  (when (&gt;= (1- j) 0) (toggle-button (aref buttons i (1- j)))) )

(defun lights-out (n m)
  &quot;Create an N by M lights out game.&quot;
  (with-ltk ()
    (let* ( ;; Create button widgets and store them for later
           (buttons
            (coerce
             (iter (for i below (* n m))
                   (collect (make-instance 'button
                                           :text &quot; &quot; )))
             'vector ))
           ;; Displace the button vector into a 2D array representing
           ;; the n by m grid.  With this we can reference buttons by
           ;; a pair of indicies, i and j.
           (b-array
            (let ((array (make-array (list n m) :displaced-to buttons)))
              ;; Some iteration stuff to build a random (yet solvable)
              ;; selection of `X's and spaces.
              (iter (for i below n)
                    (iter (for j below m)
                          (when (= 1 (random 2))
                            (toggle-block array i j n m) )))
              array )))
      (iter
        ;; Iterate over buttons
        (for b in-vector buttons)
        ;; Keep a numerical index of what button we are on.
        (for tot below (* n m))
        ;; Calculate the indicies, i and j, on the grid
        (for i = (mod tot m)) (for j = (floor tot m))
        ;; Bind a button press on one of the buttons to flip its `X'
        ;; to a space (or vice verse) and toggle its neighbors as well.
        (bind b &quot;&lt;Button-1&gt;&quot;
              (let ((i i)
                    (j j) )
                (lambda (evt)
                  (declare (ignore evt))
                  (toggle-block b-array j i n m)
                  ;; Check if you have solved the problem
                  (when (iter (for button in-vector buttons)
                              (never (button-on? button)) )
                    (do-msg &quot;You have won!!!&quot; &quot;You a winner&quot;) ))))
        ;; Here, we will use the GRID geometry manager.  This makes
        ;; sense, we are building a grid...
        (grid b i j) ))))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Modifying Widgets with ‘&lt;tt&gt;configure&lt;/tt&gt;’ ===

The function &lt;tt&gt;configure&lt;/tt&gt; is used to change various attributes of a widget such as color and font.

=== Binding ===

Binding, in the Tk sense, is associating actions with events.  We do this by calling the function &lt;tt&gt;bind&lt;/tt&gt; which modifies a widgets list of event handlers.

=== The Canvas Widget ===

The canvas widget allows you to draw arbitrary vector graphics.

==== Modifying canvas items ====
* ‘&lt;tt&gt;itemconfigure&lt;/tt&gt;’
* ‘&lt;tt&gt;itemmove&lt;/tt&gt;’
* ‘&lt;tt&gt;itembind&lt;/tt&gt;’
* ‘&lt;tt&gt;itemdelete&lt;/tt&gt;’
* ‘&lt;tt&gt;itemlower&lt;/tt&gt;’ and ‘&lt;tt&gt;itemraise&lt;/tt&gt;’

=== Bitmaps ===

Ltk can display bitmaps in widgets.  By default, Tk (and thus Ltk) supports &lt;tt&gt;GIF&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;PBM&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;PPM&lt;/tt&gt; images, all of which are rarely used these days.  In order to use modern formats like &lt;tt&gt;PNG&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;JPEG&lt;/tt&gt; you will need to install the &lt;tt&gt;libimg&lt;/tt&gt; extension library for Tcl/Tk (e.g. in Ubuntu, you need to install the &lt;tt&gt;libtk-img&lt;/tt&gt; package) and require the package before you use it (see the code below).

The following piece of code creates an Ltk window with a canvas object in it.  It then loads the image specified by the pathname &lt;tt&gt;filename&lt;/tt&gt; and places it on the canvas.  Anything outside of the 300x300 pixel canvas is merely not drawn.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defun display-image (filename)
  (with-ltk ()
    (format-wish &quot;package require Img&quot;)
    (let* ((img (make-image))
           (c (make-instance 'canvas :height 300 :width 300)) )
      ;; Pack the canvas
      (pack c)
      ;; Load the image from the file
      (image-load img filename)
      ;; Draw the image on the canvas
      (create-image c 0 0 :image img) )))
&lt;/source&gt;

The return value of &lt;tt&gt;create-image&lt;/tt&gt; is a canvas item designator.  It could be saved so the image may be modified later (i.e. moved around like in the canvas item modification examples).

Bitmaps are not limited to canvas widgets.  They can also be placed on buttons instead of text.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defun click-change (filename1 filename2)
  &quot;Make a button that switches between two different images whenever pressed.&quot;
  (with-ltk ()
    (format-wish &quot;package require Img&quot;)
    (let* ((img (make-image))
           ;; We specify text here, but it is overridden by the :image keyword
           (b (make-instance 'button :text &quot;hello!&quot; :image img
                             :command
                             (let ((imgs (make-circular-list 2 :initial-element filename2)))
                               (setf (car imgs) filename1)
                               (lambda ()
                                 (setf imgs (cdr imgs))
                                 (image-load img (car imgs)) )))))
      ;; Load the image from the file
      (image-load img filename1)
      ;; Pack the button
      (pack b) )))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Threads, lengthy calculations and ‘&lt;tt&gt;process-events&lt;/tt&gt;’ ===

The basic structure of an event driven system might look something like the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(loop
  (let ((event (get-next-event)))
    (case (name-of event)
      (:window-resize (funcall *window-resize-handler* event))
      (:button-click (funcall *button-click-handler* event))
      (:keypress (funcall *keypress-handler* event))
      ... )))
&lt;/source&gt;

This is called an event loop, or event pump.  The purpose of the event loop is to map the actions that a user performs onto the functions defined to handle them.  Any action the user makes causes new event to be inserted in a queue.  The function &lt;tt&gt;get-next-event&lt;/tt&gt; pulls the next event out of the queue and the case statement dispatches it to the correct location.  If a handler doesn't return in a timely manner, this can lead to an unresponsive program.

In order to use Ltk for more applications, we need methods of avoiding this unresponsive behavior, so we can do things like have cancel button to stop a lengthy calculation.  There are several methods of dealing with this issue; we will discuss three:

# Set up a timer event in the Tk event loop.
# Periodically pause your calculations to explicitly process events via &lt;tt&gt;process-events&lt;/tt&gt;.
# Use the Lisp implementations internal threads to separate computations from the thread running the event loop.  Of course this only works on threaded Lisp implementations.

==== Timers and ‘&lt;tt&gt;after&lt;/tt&gt;’ ====

In some cases, the handler is slow to return because you are waiting for something to happen, not computing at all.  In these cases, the correct way for the handler to behave is to return immediately, but not before telling the event loop to retry at some later time.  This is done by inserting a timer event which will come off the queue after your specified delay.  A timer event is set up by using the &lt;tt&gt;after&lt;/tt&gt; function.

==== ‘&lt;tt&gt;process-events&lt;/tt&gt;’ and ‘&lt;tt&gt;after-idle&lt;/tt&gt;’ ====

In order to use &lt;tt&gt;after&lt;/tt&gt;, it was necessary that our task was only waiting (in our example above, waiting for input on a socket) ''and'' easily suspended and resumed.  If this is not the case, then you have another option available, &lt;tt&gt;process-events&lt;/tt&gt;.  With &lt;tt&gt;process-event&lt;/tt&gt;, instead of inserting a new event and allowing LTK to process other event in the mean time, it asks the main loop to process all events currently waiting in the queue then return and allow your code to continue.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defun count-down (n)
  (with-ltk ()
    (let* ((cvs (make-instance 'canvas :height 400 :width 400))
           (text (create-text cvs 100 100 &quot;Count down: &quot;)) )
      (pack cvs)
      (force-focus cvs)
      (bind cvs &quot;&lt;q&gt;&quot;
            (lambda (evt)
              (declare (ignore evt))
              (return-from count-down) ))
      (iter (for i from n downto 0)
            (itemconfigure cvs text
                           :text (format nil &quot;Count down: ~A&quot; i) )
            ;; We must explicitly process events since the event loop isn't
            ;; running yet (not until after the body of WITH-LTK)
            (process-events)
            ;; Pretend this sleep command is actually doing some work...
            (sleep 1/100) ))))
&lt;/source&gt;

Similarly, &lt;tt&gt;after-idle&lt;/tt&gt; behaves like &lt;tt&gt;after&lt;/tt&gt; except it gets processed once the event queue is flushed but no intrinsic delay.  This has the basic behavior of &lt;tt&gt;process-events&lt;/tt&gt; but instead of resuming in the middle of a function, it triggers a new function call.  It is useful if your code is not just waiting, but is easily suspended and resumed.

==== Threaded Ltk applications ====

Using threads is by far the most powerful solution to this problem.  However, with that power, there is a great deal of added complexity.  All of the issues with threaded programs come up.  There is an added catch with Ltk, though.  The &lt;tt&gt;with-ltk&lt;/tt&gt; form sets up a special environment for your Ltk commands.  However, dynamic variables by design are not lexically captured.  This means that your function that is bound to an event is not necessarily executed in an environment where the dynamic Ltk environment is set up (although it seems like it should be).  Although this comes up in single threaded Ltk programs as well, this happens all the time in multithreaded programs.  The solution is to force the function to lexically close over the desired environment and remake the environment inside the function.

=== Remote Ltk sessions ===

Tk (and hence Ltk) provides for remote sessions.  In a remote session, a program is run on a server but the display happens elsewhere, on a client computer.  The display information is transmitted as a series of &lt;tt&gt;wish&lt;/tt&gt; commands, so efficiency of such a system is not bad.  To X11 users, this is quite similar to X11 forwarding.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is helpful to learn more about a programming language before you begin coding programs with it.  This page will help you learn more about Java.

== Programming Languages ==
Java is a programming language, a language of code the computer uses to understand what the programmer wants it to do.  There are many different programming languages, many of which are related to each other and have similar features.  Java is related to the C and C++ programming languages.  These languages have a similar structure and syntax, or word order and style.

== Object-Oriented Programming ==
Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means that nearly everything used in Java code is represented by an object.  These objects can include types of numbers such as integers, individual characters, strings of letters, or other types of objects.  Many types of objects will be created and designed by the programmer.  While Java does provide basic control structures, the strength in the language lies in the manipulation and interaction of these objects within programs.

Histograms are very important.  What is a good example for histograms where neighboring values are put in the same bucket?  Ideally buckets would be equal-count (not equal-size).

The &quot;sort the csv&quot; file example fails if the csv includes quoted text with embedded commas.

== Overview ==

The '''''Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery''''' is a law that limits the magic that underage wizards are allowed to use. The apparent intent is to keep young, untutored wizards from running amok with their [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wand|wands]] and causing consternation among the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggles]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Our first introduction to this statute is the note given to every student at the close of each school year; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] first receives his at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 17|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]] comment they always hope the note will be forgotten one year, but it never is. While not mentioning the rule by name, the note informs students they are forbidden to perform magic outside of school until they come of age.

Harry first runs afoul of this law in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 2|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']] when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] uses a Hover Charm to destroy a dessert in the Dursleys' kitchen. Evidently, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] assumes Harry performed the magic, because a letter is sent by one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mafalda Hopkirk|Mafalda Hopkirk]] warning him not do that again. 

When Harry accidentally inflates his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marge Dursley|Aunt Marge]], he is deathly afraid that, having violated this Statute, he may now be expelled from the Wizarding world. He decides his only recourse is to become a fugitive, but as he is approaching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]] to retrieve his money, he is intercepted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic]]. Fudge inexplicably dismisses the inflating incident.

When Harry uses [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|the Patronus charm]] to protect [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]], he is once again told that he has violated this Decree, and his wand will be destroyed. This results, eventually, in a hearing, at which it is determined that Harry was justified in using magic to defend himself and a Muggle bystander against a magical threat.

Finally, Harry is overjoyed when, on his seventeenth birthday, he is free to use any magic he chooses without hindrance.

== Analysis ==

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we learn that the technique that is used to determine whether a Wizarding child has performed magic is called the Trace. This apparently will detect a child using magic by triggering some alert within the Ministry. Apparently, in order to be sensitive enough to register the child using small spells, it also detects other magic being used nearby. We are told that in Wizarding households, it is the parents responsibility to monitor their child using magic, as adults using magic near him may trigger the Trace accidentally; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle-born|Muggle-born]] wizards, however, are directly monitored by the Ministry, as it is assumed that the only magic that can occur near them is their own. This is presumably why Dobby's Hover charm was attributed to Harry.

One must wonder, though, about the Trace's accuracy. There is no apparent notice when Aunt Marge's glass magically shatters, or the cabinet under the stairs magically unlocks as Harry leaves [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]]. There is no apparent notice when magic occurs in Harry's vicinity when he stays at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Burrow]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]], or in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]]. There is no notice of the magic occurring in his vicinity when he is being visited by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]], the Advance Guard, or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] at Privet Drive, or when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is taking him off the island and back to shore in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|the first book]]. If we assume that the Trace can detect an adult wizard, and damp its responses accordingly, then the only unexplained situations are the shattering wineglass and the opening cupboard during Aunt Marge's stay at Privet Drive, and possibly the summoning of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Knight Bus|Knight Bus]]. Those, along with Aunt Marge's inflation, might have been lumped together and forgiven by Cornelius Fudge.

However, it is also true that the Ministry does not seem to be aware of Harry's use of magic before he turns eleven. In the first chapters of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', Harry unknowingly shrinks a horrible sweater down to doll-size so that he won't have to wear it, flies to a rooftop to avoid a beating from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] and his gang, regrows his hair overnight, and makes the glass vanish from a snake's cage. However, there are no warnings issued by the Ministry during this time. Possibly the Trace is only activated when the child reaches the age of 11 and is assumed to be consciously able to direct his or her magic. Could the law also prevent selling or giving wands to children under the age of 11?

This still leaves issues with the Trace remaining quiescent when the Twins and Ron are in Arthur's flying car, when Harry joins them, and when Harry and Ron are flying the car to Hogwarts. Certainly the car is a magical artifact, and so the Trace should be active, but none of the underage wizards involved in that escapade receive warnings. Another writer, in another series (Randall Garrett, in the ''Lord Darcy'' series), has drawn a distinction between active and passive magic, saying that possessing or using a charmed object is significantly different than actively creating a new spell. It is probably necessary that this same distinction be built into the Trace, as the number of charmed objects in the ordinary Wizarding household that would be used by a child is quite extensive — an infant banging on a self-stirring cauldron with a spoon, for instance, could be considered someone using a magical object. If this distinction was not made by the Trace itself, the Ministry would be overwhelmed with reports of magical objects being used by underage wizards.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

As a side light, we note that Harry's being able to do magic at will after his seventeenth birthday proves nothing about whether the Trace has ended (&quot;been broken&quot;). At the time, Harry is in Ron's room, in close company with a wizard who is of age (Ron). In such a situation, as we have noted above, the Trace does not respond to use of magic in the vicinity. This actually becomes a plot point shortly thereafter: the following day, the Trio leave The Burrow as the news of the fall of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] reaches there, and shortly afterwards are attacked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] in a café on the Tottenham Court Road. Harry wonders if they had been located through the Trace, but Ron dismisses that, saying the Trace could not have been re-established since it had broken the day before.

As both Ron and Hermione are of age before Harry, even if the Trace had remained in place, it quite possibly would have remained quiescent as long as Harry remained in their company. So the fact that it had not triggered a warning from the Ministry is not a clear indication that it had ceased to exist. As it turns out, there is no point at which Harry was completely out of the company of nominally-mature wizards until after the retreat to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]]. Once they have settled there, Harry does [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparate]] out to the approaches to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] as the Trio plan their break-in. This is the first point in the story where Harry is performing magic when he is not near mature wizards. We believe that this surveillance of the Ministry continues through much of August, starting after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus]] is brought back to Grimmauld Place, possibly a week after Harry's birthday. So while we cannot be certain exactly when the Trace is broken, it is reasonably certain that it occurred no later than early August, and that it is likely that it occurred as expected on Harry's birthday.

This is worth mentioning because a plot point hinges on it. After the Death Eater attack on the Tottenham Court Road, Harry wonders if they might have located the Trio by means of the Trace. Despite Ron's assurances, readers may wonder if the Trace could still be active, given that Harry had not been out of the company of mature wizards when doing magic. It will turn out that the mechanism by which they had been discovered was their use of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's]] name; Voldemort had placed a taboo on his name, so that Death Eaters could be sent to destroy anyone who dared to speak it. Harry's raising the possibility of the Trace still being active obscures this possibility, until it is revealed by Ron after Christmas.

Now that you are armed with the knowledge of letters ੳ, ਅ, ੲ, ਸ and ਹ along with the vowels and the diacritics let us 
move on to the second row (ਕ ਵਰਗ) of Gurmukhi script. 
The letters of this row are called ''velars'' because they are articulated at ''velum''. Velum is the soft palate, the back part of the roof of the mouth. The back part of the tongue called dorsum touches the velum for their articulation and hence they are also occasionally called dorsals.

== Second row - the Velars ==

{{Listen|filename=GurmukhiVelars.ogg|title=Second row|description=Play for names of these letters|format=[[Ogg]]}} The second row of Gurmukhi consists of the following five letters. 
:&lt;span style =&quot;font-size: 200%;&quot;&gt;ਕ ਖ ਗ ਘ ਙ&lt;/span&gt;
These letters are called ਕ - ''kukka'', ਖ - ''khukha'', ਗ - ''gugga'', ਘ - ''ghugga'' and ਙ - ''ngunga''. Their pronunciation is ਕ - /k/, ਖ - /kh/, ਗ - /g/, ਘ - /gh/ and ਙ - /ng/. We now consider each of them one by one.
;&lt;span style =&quot;font-size: 200%;&quot;&gt;ਕ&lt;/span&gt; Kukka : The sixth letter of Gurmukhi is equivalent to /k/ in English. This illustration will explain its usage.
::ਕੇ + ਕ = ਕੇਕ = cake
:See how ਹ that you learnt in first lesson and ਕ combine to give ''hook'' and ''hockey''.
::ਹੁ + ਕ = ਹੁਕ  = hook
::ਹਾ + ਕੀ = ਹਾਕੀ = hockey 
;&lt;span style =&quot;font-size: 200%;&quot;&gt;ਖ&lt;/span&gt; Khukha : The seventh letter of Gurmukhi is equivalent to /kh/ as in Kazakh. This sound is rarely used in English but is quite prevalent in Punjabi. The word ''khaki'' contains both the letters ਕ and ਖ
::ਖਾ + ਕੀ = ਖਾਕੀ = khaki 
: If you have difficulty pronouncing ਖ try this - while producing /k/ sound throw out lots of breath from the throat, the resultant sound shall be ਖ. Sounds so produced, that is by throwing breath out with a rush, are called aspirated sounds. 
: The second letter ਜ਼ in the following example is equivalent to /z/.
::ਕ + ਜ਼ਾ + ਖ = ਕਜ਼ਾਖ = Kazakh (Kazakh language or a Kazakhstan national)
;&lt;span style =&quot;font-size: 200%;&quot;&gt;ਗ&lt;/span&gt; Gugga : The eighth letter of Gurmukhi is equivalent to /g/. The words ''gas'' and ''hug'' when written in Gurmukhi will further ilustrate its use.
::ਗੈ + ਸ = ਗੈਸ = gas 
::ਹੱ + ਗ = ਹੱਗ = hug
;&lt;span style =&quot;font-size: 200%;&quot;&gt;ਘ&lt;/span&gt; Ghugga : There is no English equivalent of ਘ, the ninth letter of Gurmukhi. ਘ sound is produced by combining ਕ sound with a [[Punjabi/Phonetics#tone|tone]] in the initial position and a tone with ਗ sound elsewhere. The nearest English equivalent of ਘ is /gh/ and nearest examples illustrating the use ਘ will be '''ghost''' and '''Ghana'''. The letters ਟ and ਨ represent /t/ and /n/ sounds to be introduced later.
::ਘੋ + ਸ + ਟ = ਘੋਸਟ = ghost
::ਘਾ + ਨਾ = ਘਾਨਾ = Ghana
;&lt;span style =&quot;font-size: 200%;&quot;&gt;ਙ&lt;/span&gt; Ngunga : The tenth letter of Gurmukhi is equivalent to /ng/ as in sing. The use of this letter is becoming scarce in Punjabi. It never comes at the initial position in any Punjabi word. The words ''sing'' and ''king'' will be written in Gurmukhi as
::ਸਿੰ + ਙ = ਸਿੰਙ = sing
::ਕਿੰ + ਙ = ਕਿੰਙ = king

== Exercises ==

1. Use Practice module to write the letters of the second row in your note book as many times as you may feel comfortable. You can click one of the letters below to go to relevant page of the practice module.
: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%; align: center;&quot;&gt;[[Punjabi/Gurmukhi/Practice/ਕ|ਕ]] [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi/Practice/ਖ|ਖ]] [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi/Practice/ਗ|ਗ]] [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi/Practice/ਘ|ਘ]] [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi/Practice/ਙ|ਙ]] &lt;/span&gt;

2. Read these English words written in Gurmukhi
#ਹੁਕ
#ਹੱਗ
#ਹਾਂਗਕਾਂਗ
#ਕੇਕ
#ਕਾਂਗੋ
#ਕਿੰਙ 
#ਖਾਕੀ
#ਸੇਕ
#ਕਿਸ
{{HideNseek|title=Solutions|text=
#Hook
#Hug
#Hongkong
#Cake
#Congo
#King
#Khaki
#Sake
#Kiss}}
3. Write the above listed words in Gurmukhi and English side by side.

4. Write these English words in Gurmukhi
#Gas
#Hockey
#Case
#Kiosk
#Excess
#Egg
#Sick
#Hague
{{HideNseek|title=Solutions|text=
#ਗੈ + ਸ = ਗੈਸ
#ਹਾ + ਕੀ = ਹਾਕੀ
#ਕੇ + ਸ = ਕੇਸ
#ਕਿ + ਔ + ਸ + ਕ = ਕਿਔਸਕ
#ਇ + ਕ + ਸੈੱ + ਸ = ਇਕਸੈੱਸ 
#ਐੱ + ਗ = ਐੱਗ
#ਸਿੱ + ਕ = ਸਿੱਕ
#ਹੇ + ਗ = ਹੇਗ }}

== Summary ==

In this lesson we have learnt the five letters of the second row (ਕ ਵਰਗ) of Gurmukhi script. These letter are ''kukka'' (ਕ = /k/), ''khukha'' (ਖ = /kh/), ''gugga'' (ਗ = /g/), ''ghugga'' (ਘ = /gh/) and  ''ngunga'' (ਙ = /ng/). We have seen that ਖ and ਘ sounds are rarely used in English and ਙ in Punjabi.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''hard disk drive''' (HDD), commonly referred to as a hard drive, or hard disk, is a non-volatile storage device which stores digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating platters with magnetic surfaces. Strictly speaking, &quot;drive&quot; refers to a device distinct from its medium, such as a tape drive and its tape, or a floppy disk drive and its floppy disk. Early HDDs had removable media; however, an HDD today is typically a sealed unit (except for a filtered vent hole to equalize air pressure) with fixed media.

There are four main connection types for HDDs.  These are:
*PATA - parallel ATA.  (previously known as IDE or EIDE). 
*SATA - serial ATA.
*SCSI - small computer system interface.  
*External - hard drives that connect to an external port on the system.

== Parallel ATA ==
[[File:Ata_20070127_002.jpg|thumb|right|A parallel ATA ribbon cable.]]
The parallel ATA (PATA) is a keyed 40-pin connection commonly in a form of a ribbon cable, with the first pin being marked by a red wire.  Most cables give two connections for two potential hard drives.  The later standard of PATA allowed for a total of 80 connections (2 per pin) for a faster transfer rate.  

Hard drives connected by this system need to be set to either a Master or Slave using a removable jumper. In some cases, you may need to set the jumper to &quot;Cable select&quot; if the cable is designed in that fashion. 

Mainboards normally have two PATA connections available, and support two devices on each connection.  Expansion cards are available to allow additional hard drives within a computer.  

Parallel ATA originally supported 16MB/s.  Later versions of ATA increased the speed to 33, 66, 100, and 133MB/s. 

== Serial ATA ==
[[File:SATA ports.jpg|thumb|right|SATA and its port]]
{{sect-stub}}
Serial ATA hard drives use a small connector.  Unlike Parallel ATA, only one hard drive per port is allowed. 

Despite only having a few pins, Serial ATA is much faster than the predessor.  It allows data transfer starting at 1.5 Gbit/s (192MB/s), and can be as high as 6Gbit/s. 
{{-}}
== SCSI ==
{{sect-stub}}
SCSI, or Small Computer System Interface, is a standard for attaching multiple devices onto a single connection chain.  It normally allows 7 or 15 devices depending on the standard (not counting the SCSI controller itself.) It is mostly used in servers. 

SCSI connection chains must be terminated - otherwise you will have undesirable interference preventing the devices from working.

== External ==
{{sect-stub}}
There are hard drives that connect to an external port on the computer, either due to their design, or because they are mounted in an external hard drive.  The common connection types include Firewire and USB - both of these connections are described in more detail in the [[A+ Certification/Ports|ports chapter]].

Found this page while exploring a list of uncategorized pages. It's generally worthy of deletion anyway (short stub, un-edited, old, etc) but I think it's also a copyright violation. At least, the note at the bottom of the page indicates that it was previously published. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:51, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' - I agree this is very likely a copyright violation until we get [[m:OTRS|permission]]. Furthermore, it is an [[WB:OR|essay]], not a textbook. While it is possible to have a textbook on safe drinking water, this is not it, and this is not something to build from. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:54, 13 July 2008 (UTC)
:[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' - I tried multiple scholarly journal sites and could not find anything resembling this article, though Dr. Haroon had many hits which dealt water/sewage sanitation and Pakistan. The user is also gone, it seems, so we can't contact him/her. Ultimately it does seem it is copyrighted material.

Enough with the differentiation, already! Time for
something new.
New, but not all that different.
Once you have learned about differentiation in your
Math classes, you will surely start to learn about
''integration''. As stated very early on,
integration is the summing up 
of all the tiny (infinitesimal) pieces of a curve.
So if ''dy'' represents one of the (infinitely) many
bits of the curve ''y'', then:

    &lt;math&gt; \int\! \, dy = y&lt;/math&gt;

Indeed, if you sum up all the bits of a thing, you
get the thing itself.
&lt;ref&gt;
Assuming you don't believe in that magical marketing term, ''synergy''.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summing a series ==

As with differentiation, there are two kinds of integration,
numeric and symbolic.
Like differentiation, numeric integration gives an
approximate result while symbolic integration gives an
exact result.  Since numeric integration involves the actual
summing up of a bunch of little bits,
let's get some practice summing.

What is the sum of:

    &lt;math&gt; 1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{16}+ ... &lt;/math&gt;
    
with an infinite number of fractions following the pattern.
We have a two issues to solve before we can write code to give
us the answer. The first is that the sum seems to be composed of 
two different things, a whole number (1) and a bunch of fractions.

Life is so much easier when all things are the same; if
this is so, we
have no need of cluttering up our code with ''if'' expresssions to
decide on what kind of thing we are working on.
&lt;ref&gt;
We saw this previously when we made a constant look like a term.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In general, if we have two kinds of things we wish to treat the same,
we need to either make the first look like the second, the
second look like the first, or both look like some other thing.
In the specific case of this summation, we need to either:

* make the fractions look like whole numbers,
* make the whole number look like a fraction, or
* make the whole number and the fractions look like a third kind of thing

Of the three strategies, the second seems to be the easiest route
since a a whole number is easily represented as a fraction by
placing a one in the denominator:

    &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{1} +\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{16}+ ... &lt;/math&gt;

----
At this point, you should familiarize yourself with
[[The Sway Reference Manual/Loops|iterative loops]] and
[[The_Sway_Reference_Manual/Recursion#More_on_recursive_loops|recursive loops]].
----

The remaining issue we need to solve is how to structure our code. It
is clear that we will need some kind of loop, either recursive or
iterative, to add up as many fractions as desired.
In order to use a loop, we usually need to make the items we are looping
over look the same or at least be a function of the loop counter.
In our case,
how do we make each fraction look alike?

If we look at the denominator, we see that each can be described
as a power of two:

    &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2^0} +\frac{1}{2^1}+\frac{1}{2^2}+\frac{1}{2^3}+\frac{1}{2^4}+ ... &lt;/math&gt;

It seems that we can use a loop counter (starting at zero) as the
exponent in the denominator of each fraction.  With these two
issues out of the way, we can begin to write some code.
Let's try the recursive route first.

=== The recursive way ===

We will use ''n'' as our
loop counter:

    function total(n)
        {
        1 / (2 ^ n) + total(n + 1);
        }

If we call ''total'' with an initial value of zero for ''n'',
we should get:

    1 / (2 ^ 0) + total(1)

Upon the next recursive call, we should get:

    1 / (2 ^ 0) + [1 / (2 ^ 1) + total(2)]

And then:

    1 / (2 ^ 0) + [1 / (2 ^ 1) + [1 / (2 ^ 2) + total(3)]]

This is exactly what we want, but we are going to end up
summing an infinite number of terms.
We have neglected to have a base case for stopping
the recursion. Let's pass in the number of fractions we wish to
sum up as ''max'':

    function total(n,max)
        {
        if (n == max)
            {
            0;
            }
        else
            {
            1 / (2 ^ n) + total(n + 1,max);
            }
        }

The recursion stops when ''n'' reaches ''max''.

What do we get if we total up five fractions?

    sway&gt; total(0,5);
    REAL_NUMBER: 1.9375000000

Is this correct? Let's add up five fractions explicitly:

    sway&gt; 1.0 / 1 + (1.0 / 2) + (1.0 / 4) + (1.0 / 8) + (1.0 / 16);
    REAL_NUMBER: 1.9375000000

Seems to be. How about ten fractions?

    sway&gt; total(0,10);
    REAL_NUMBER: 1.9980468750

Fifty fractions?

    sway&gt; total(0,50);
    REAL_NUMBER: 2.0000000000

One hundred fractions?

    sway&gt; total(0,100);
    REAL_NUMBER: 2.0000000000

These results lead us to believe that if we were to add up
these fractions out to infinity, we would get 2 as a total.
Of course, since our result is a real number, we need to be
wary of 
trusting it absolutely, but in this case, I'd be willing to
bet the result is correct.

How about we add some visualization to this function?
We probably should have done this first to make sure our
code was behaving as expected:

    function total(n,max)
        {
        if (n == max)
            {
            println(&quot;0&quot;);
            0;
            }
        else
            {
            var denom = 2 ^ n;
            print(&quot;1/&quot;,integer(denom),&quot; + &quot;);
            1 / denom + total(n + 1,max);
            }
        }

Note how we 'precomputed' the denominator since we need it twice,
once for the visualization and one for the actual computation.
We also use the ''integer'' function to convert the real number
that exponentiation produces back to an integer.

    sway&gt;total(0,5);
    1/1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 0
    REAL_NUMBER: 1.9375000000

Looking good!
Of course, our visualization does not produce a valid Sway
expression (whitespace and precedence problems), but that
is rarely necessary for a visualization.

=== An iterative approach ===

Let's try using an iterative loop instead.
There is a standard methodology for converting 
a recursive loop to an iterative loop.
The first step is to initialize a local variable,
say ''result'', to the recursive loop's base case
return value (and then return it).
In this case, the return value is
zero:

    function total(n,max)
        {
        var result = 0;

        return result;
        }

Now we add a while loop with the opposite
of the test found in the recursive loop's ''if'' expression:

    function total(n,max)
        {
        var result = 0;

        while (not(n == max))     //better is n != max)
            {
            }

        return result;
        }

In the body of the loop, we place the recursive case calculation:

    function total(n,max)
        {
        var result = 0;

        while (n != max))
            {
            var denom = 2 ^ n;
            1 / denom + total(n + 1,max);
            }

        return result;
        }

replacing the recursive call with ''result'':

    function total(n,max)
        {
        var result = 0;

        while (n != max))
            {
            var denom = 2 ^ n;
            1 / denom + result;   //was total(n + 1,max)
            }
        }

and assigning the whole expression back to ''result'':

    function total(n,max)
        {
        var result = 0;

        while (n != max))
            {
            var denom = 2 ^ n;
            result = 1 / denom + result;   //was total(n + 1,max)
            }

        return result;
        }

Finally, if any variable was updated in the original recursive
call, update the variable at the bottom of the loop using assignment:

    function total(n,max)
        {
        var result = 0;

        while (n != max))
            {
            var denom = 2 ^ n;
            result = 1 / denom + result;
            n = n + 1;
            }

        return result;
        }

Voila! We're done. This technique generally works 
well and will even work if there are multiple base
cases and mulitple recursive cases.
Sometimes, however, things go a little bit wrong in the
transformation. Here's and example;
let's convert the recursive version of
the greatest common divisor function:

    function gcd(n,d)
        {
        if (d == 0)
            {
            n;
            }
        else
            {
            gcd(d,n % d);
            }
        }

We start with the base case return value:

     function gcd(n,d)
         {
         var result = n;

         return result;
         }

Next, we add a while loop:

     function gcd(n,d)
         {
         var result = n;

         while (d != 0)
             {
             }

         return result;
         }

Then we copy over the recursive case calculation:

     function gcd(n,d)
         {
         var result = n;

         while (d != 0)
             {
             gcd(d,n % d);
             }

         return result;
         }

We replace the recursive call in the calculation by ''result'':

     function gcd(n,d)
         {
         var result = n;

         while (d != 0)
             {
             result;      //was gcd(d,n % d);
             }

         return result;
         }

Now we update the variables that change in the recursive call:

     function gcd(n,d)
         {
         var result = n;

         while (d != 0)
             {
             result;      //was gcd(d,n % d);
             n = d;
             d = n % d;
             }

         return result;
         }

We should be done at this point, but we still have a couple
of problems. The first is that the statement:

    result;

in the body of the while loop isn't doing anything useful.
This is our first clue that something is amiss. For now,
let's delete it:

     function gcd(n,d)
         {
         var result = n;

         while (d != 0)
             {
             n = d;
             d = n % d;
             }

         return result;
         }

The second problem is that in the recursive call, the update to 
variable ''d'' used the old value of ''n'' but in our transformation,
the update to ''d'' uses the ''new'' value of ''n''. We need
to save the old value and we use a temporary variable to do so:

     function gcd(n,d)
         {
         var result = n;

         while (d != 0)
             {
             var temp = n;
             n = d;
             d = temp % d;
             }

         return result;
         }

The final problem is that result never changes. That's because
we initially set result to the original value of ''n'', not
the last value of ''n''. Note that the recursive version uses
the last value of ''n'' as desired. Thus, we update ''result''
after the while loop terminates to get the last value of ''n''.

     function gcd(n,d)
         {
         var result = n;

         while (d != 0)
             {
             var temp = n;
             n = d;
             d = temp % d;
             }

         result = n;

         return result;
         }

Of course, we can clean up our function up a bit by realizing that
''result'' isn't doing anything at all; we can just return 
the last value of ''n'':

     function gcd(n,d)
         {
         while (d != 0)
             {
             var temp = n;
             n = d;
             d = temp % d;
             }

         return n;
         }

This technique, at best, gets you the right answer. At worst,
it gets you well on the way towards the right answer.

== Summing as an abstraction ==

Note that in both our recursive and iterative solutions to the original
summation, we have hard-wired the function that computes the
next element in the sequence (namely the inverted exponentiation).
An important design strategy for writing computer programs is
called ''separation of concerns''.
With this strategy, we try to write functions, or sets of
functions, so that each function performs a single task.
In our solutions, both the generation of the next fraction
(one concern) and the summing of those fractions (another
concern),
are found in a single function,
We can separate those concerns into individual functions.
One function generates the fractions to be summed; the
other performs the actual summing, given the previously
generated collection
of fractions.
Our first task, then, is to generate
the collection of fractions.
We will examine to ways of gathering a collection together,
''arrays'' and ''lists''.

----
At this point, you should familiarize yourself with
[[The Sway Reference Manual/Arrays and Lists|arrays and lists]].
----

Here is the code for generating a list of the desired fractions:

    function invPowOfTwo(n,max)
        {
        if (n == max)
            {
            :null;
            }
        else
            {
            1 / (2 ^ n) join invPowOfTwo(n + 1,max);
            }
        }

If I wanted an array instead of a list, I might write the function
as&lt;ref&gt;
Lists lend themselves to recursive solutions, arrays to iterative
solutions.
&lt;/ref&gt;:

    function invPowOfTwo(n,max)
        {
        var a = allocate(max);

        while (n &lt; max)
            {
            a[n] = 1 / (2 ^ n);
            n = n + 1;
            }

        a;
        }


Either way, once I have my collection of fractions, I can now
sum then with a general purpose summer:

    function sum(items)
        {
        if (items == :null)
            {
            0;
            }
        else
            {
            head(items) + sum(tail(items);
            }
        }

Whether I pass an array or list to ''sum'', I get the total of
all the items in the collection.
&lt;ref&gt;
Don't try this with other languages! In almost every other
language, the operators/functions for decomposing a list
are different than decomposing an array.
&lt;/ref&gt;.

I could also have written ''sum'' iteratively:

    include(&quot;basics&quot;);
     
    function sum(items)
        {
        var i;
        var total = 0;

        for-each(i,items)
            {
            total = total + i;
            }

        total;
        }

This version will also sum up the collection of items in either list
or array form, but for one of these forms, the process is rather slow
(see the exercises).

The advantage of separating the generation of elements from the
process of summing is this. Once we have our list of elements,
we can do more things than just sum with them. We can visualize
them, invert them,
(after inverting) find the ones that are Mersenne primes plus 1, and so on.
Likeise, we can use our summing function to sum up other kinds
of collections.

== Pseudo-infinite sequences ==

What if we go through the trouble a generating a set of elements to
be summed or processed in some fashion and neglected to produce a
large enough collection? We are stuck with regenerating the collection
again, throwing away all the work we did previously.

The problem is we had to specify the max before we perform the
summing:

    function invPowOfTwo(n,max)
        {
        if (n == max)
            {
            :null;
            }
        else
            {
            1 / (2 ^ n) join invPowOfTwo(n + 1,max);
            }
        }

It sure would be nice if we didn't have to specify in advance
how large the collection should be. Not requiring a ''max''
also would simplify the
code:

    function invPowOfTwo(n)
        {
        1 / (2 ^ n) join invPowOfTwo(n + 1);
        }

The problem is, without a base case,
we will fall into an infinite recursive
loop. However, we can avoid this pitfall through ''delayed'' or
''lazy evaluation''.

----
At this point, you should familiarize yourself with
[[The Sway Reference Manual/Lazy Evaluation|lazy evaluation]].
----

Let's write a version of ''invPowOfTwo'' that delays evaluation
of the recursive call:

    function invPowOfTwo(n)
        {
        1 / (2 ^ n) join delay(invPowOfTwo(n + 1));
        }

Note the use of the ''delay'' function wrapped around the
recursive call.
What ''delay'' does is save everything needed to compute
the recursive call without actually making the call. The
actual call can be made later using the information
saved by ''delay''.

Let's look at the result of callng our new function:

    sway&gt; var items = invPowOfTwo(0);
    LIST: (1.0000000000 # &lt;THUNK 11167&gt;)

We see the first element of our list is 1.0, as expected.
Rather than seeing the rest of our list, however,
we see that a ''thunk'' has been glued on as the
tail of the list (the sharp sign signifies that the
tail of the list is not a proper list). We can examine
the thunk:

    sway&gt; var t = tail(items);
    THUNK: &lt;THUNK 11167&gt;
     
    sway&gt; pp(t);
    &lt;THUNK 11086&gt;:
        context: &lt;OBJECT 11071&gt;
        code: invPowOfTwo(n + 1)
    THUNK: &lt;THUNK 11086&gt;

We see that the ''code'' field of the thunk object holds
the actual call. The ''context'' field holds an environment
containing the values
of ''n'' and ''invPowOfTwo'', all that is
needed to make the actual call.

A list of this sort is known as a ''delayed stream'' or
''stream'' for short. The stream metaphor is used since
as long as there is source of water (memory), the stream will never
run dry.

How do we get the elements other than the first element out
of the stream? With the ''force'' function. The ''force''
function, when given a thunk as an argument, performs the
evaluation that was delayed in the first place:

    sway&gt; head(items);
    REAL_NUMBER: 1.0000000000
      
    sway&gt; tail(items):
    THUNK: &lt;THUNK 11167&gt;

    sway&gt; force(tail(items));
    LIST: (0.5000000000 # &lt;THUNK 11193&gt;)

By forcing the tail of the original list, we end up with
a new list generated by the call &lt;tt&gt;invPowOfTwo(n + 1)&lt;/tt&gt;.
When this call was delayed, ''n'' had a value of zero. Now
that the call is being made, ''invPowOfTwo'' is passed a
value of one. This generates a new list with &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2^1}&lt;/math&gt;
at the head and another delayed recursive call. This time, delay
will remember that ''n'' has a value of one instead of zero.

Let's define a function to obtain any element of a stream.
We will pass in the index and then successively force the
tail of the list until we get to the correct element:

    function streamIndex(s,i)
        {
        if (index == 0) // the head of the stream is desired
            {
            head(s);
            }
        else
            {
            streamIndex(force(tail(s)),i - 1);
            }
        }

Note that if we want element ''i'' of a list with more than
''i'' elements, that is
the same as wanting element ''i'' - 1 of the tail of the list.
When we take the tail of the list, the desired element appears
to move one step closer to the front of the list.
&lt;ref&gt;
This is very important. Convince yourself this is so.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Now we can sum a stream:

    function sumStream(s,count)
        {
        if (count == 0)
            {
            0;
            }
        else
            {
            head(s) + sumStream(force(tail(s)),count - 1);
            }
        }

without having to worry about how many elements were originally
generated.
Iteratively, summing a stream might look like:

    function sumStream(s,count)
        {
        var total = 0;

        while (count &gt; 0)
            {
            total = total + head(s);
            s = force(tail(s));
            count = count + 1;
            }

        total;
        }

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''Educational Grant Writing for Technology==


Usually for a designated purpose, an educational grant is a sum of money or resources that is donated to a school.  The person(s) or institution who authors the grant is called the grant writer, while the person or, more likely, organization that donates the money/resources is called the grant maker.

[[Image:Dollar_symbol_gold.svg‎|right|thumb|250px|cashmoney]]


=='''Planning'''==






Writing grants is an excellent way to augment a school's resources; however, grant writing is a process rather than an event.  The actual writing is only a small part of the overall process.  For the purposes of your planning, I’ve organized the process in the subsequent stages:

•Identifying a need

•Conceptualize a project

•Researching for donors

•Draft the proposal

•Implement the project

•Thank the donor

== '''Pre-Planning Steps''' ==



Long before you ever put pen to paper (more likely finger to keyboard), you should ask yourself some very important questions.  Why are you about to engage in this arduous and time consuming project?  And, is it worth it?  Prior to taking any of the more formal steps that I have laid out, conduct an informal cost-benefit analysis.  Are you passionate about the project to the extent that you’re willing to commit yourself to it?  

Only proceed if the answer is an honest “yes”.  Writing a grant may seem somewhat like typing a paper for a college class; but, it’s different in one very important way. There is no A-.  Either you are funded, or you are not.  Engaging in grant writing is, by nature, entering into a competition.  Therefore, the quality of your work must be par excelam.  A halfhearted attempt isn’t worth making.

== '''Assembling a Team''' ==




It is better to work alone than to toil beside colleagues who cannot or will not make a positive contribution to your project.  Having a teammate who is resistant, indifferent, or incompetent is a burden, but sometimes working with other people is unavoidable.  By planning ahead and starting your project early, you can avoid needing the help of colleagues.  Rewriting a poorly drafted piece can be more time consuming than authoring it from scratch.  A common mistake is presuming an individual is a competent writer because she/he appears to be intelligent.  Good writers only become good writers through practice.  


As technology coordinator, it is unlikely that you will have the means to dole out a reward or the authority requisite for coercing other teachers into helping.  If you are going to assemble a volunteer army, you’ll need a phenomenon referred to in educational academia as “teacher buy in.”  Especially, when the task you are proposing is not rewarded in some way (typically with extra pay), motivating colleagues to perform can be extremely frustrating.  


Making the project appear like it’s a worthwhile endeavor, “teacher buy in” means that you sell the idea of proceeding with a project to your colleagues .  Often, striking a deal works well.  When participating colleagues understand that they will benefit upon the funding of a project, the quality of their work escalates due to their newfound degree of stakeholder-ship.  


Although grants can be written without the help of administrators, it is good to involve supervisors for several reasons.  First, they may be able to pay you for extra work or free you from your other obligations.  Secondly, if you are awarded the grant, you will most likely need their help in implementing the resources into the school culture.  A grant is not successful if the school acquires a wealth of resources and nobody uses them.  Finally, if you are awarded the grant, and they hear about it from an outside party, the administrators might feel slighted and react with anger.


== '''Identify a Need''' ==



Identify a specific need you have that obstructs the attainment of an educational goal.  The need should be related to an educational outcome derived from some measure of student learning.  For example, one doesn’t begin the grant writing process with the idea “I want a Mac lab.”  Rather, begin the process with the idea, “I want my students to become proficient with digital multimedia.”  Or, “I want my students to understand the basic tenants of graphic design, so they can incorporate these skills into an online portfolio.”  

Although this seems like a semantic step, it will galvanize the specific points you will address in your statement of need.  The nature of your starting point is critical because it will inform you as to both the software and hardware requirements requisite to fulfill your grant.  Additionally, better understanding your desired outcome will inform you regarding the various forms of teacher training you will need to integrate.

== '''Design a Project''' ==



After you identify a specific need, then you can begin to conceptualize a project.  Build your project from your original educational goal.  First, brainstorm a series of ideas.  It helps to have a colleague(s) who is professionally “operating on the same wavelength.”  Make a conscious effort to make a logical decision.  Often times, we become attached to ideas because they are our own.  Remember to be open to the ideas of others.


When beginning to conceptualize your project, keep in mind, “Is this practically feasible?”  Getting funding to replace your computer lab is reasonable.  Installing a retractable dome above the school’s playground is unreasonable and a waste of time.  You are going to have to explain this project in detail, so consider the feasibility in terms of not only money, but time and legality as well.


Among the most important aspects of a grant proposal is a quantifiable measure of success (or failure).  Grant makers want to be able to discernibly prove that their money has not been wasted.  So, conceiving of a finished product that can be photographed, measured, and displayed is advantageous toward the success of your grant.  The numbers of clients served is additionally important to the attractiveness of the proposal.  For example, having you students host a school-wide film festival that is the culmination a whole years work is attractive because the number of participants can be measured.  And, there is a tangible product complete with photo opportunities.

== '''The Search for Donors''' ==



I would categorize the way one goes about finding a grant maker in two separate groups.   The first way is to cross reference your need with the mission statements of foundations and philanthropic organizations.  The Foundation Center in Manhattan is an excellent resource which archives charitable foundations throughout the United States.  Of course, you can search online for NGOs and foundations that are a good match.  Remember—these organizations ''raison d’être'' is funding projects like yours.  Without projects like yours foundations are failing to achieve their mandated goals.

Here are some places that might help you find a prospective donor:


[Discovery Education
http://school.discoveryeducation.com/schrockguide/business/grants.html]

[Grant Alerts
http://www.grantsalert.com/]
	   

The second way of identifying a project is by maintaining open lines of communication and seizing opportunities as they come along.  Regularly check websites in your school district that post tech grant opportunities.  Utilize professional organizations and trade shows.  Grant opportunities are showcased in trade journals for teaching, supervision/administration, and technology.  For example, grants are posted in NYC in the principal’s weekly newsletter.  Google the descriptors for educational grant AND technology (you can reduce the number of hits by including your location) whenever the thought crosses your mind.  Ask individuals in administrative rolls for any information they might have because they may have information that they themselves are to busy (or apathetic).  Persistence typically pays off.  If you always keep your eyes out for potential ways to score a grant, eventually a good candidate will fall in your lap.

== '''Draft the Proposal''' ==


Drafting the proposal is the part of the process you colleagues associate with grant writing.  In regard to writing, the style should be hyper-journalistic.  It should be extremely concise and as brief as possible.  Your use of language should be accessible and clear without sounding inarticulate.  Avoid using any professional jargon because the person reading your grant will probably not be an educator.  

Remember the main idea from the first paragraph…grant writing is a process not an event.  So, write and refine, then rewrite and re-refine until you have it just right.  As with any piece of writing, never submit it until you’ve had someone who you trust review it for errors.  

Some grants are structured with predefined templates that have very specific parameters.  Read and reread the direction, and follow the directions exactly.  Grant makers will eliminate documents based upon disqualifications for not writing in accordance with the rules of the grant.  This means that they won’t even read any of your hard work if they suspect that you have violated the terms of the grant.  There are few things more discouraging than working for weeks to draft the perfect proposal, patiently waiting for a response, and getting it back only to be informed that your work was unread due to a technicality.

If you are submitting a grant which does not have a predefined form, a typical grant is structured in the following way:



•Introduction

•Statement of need

•Project Outline

•Budget


'''Introduction'''

In the introduction section, state the nature of your project.  Highlighting the most positive aspects, profile the school.  Oddly, grant makers would rather give money to a school with a proven track record of success than an institution in extremely high need that’s falling apart.  Always consider that they need to feel like their money won’t be wasted.  The introduction should showcase the educational outcome rather than the school need.  For example, “The brilliant students from PS 123 are high achievers despite coming from a socio-economically disadvantageous family situation.  Evidence for this exists in the following form….”  Never bash the school; instead, point to any measurable degree of recent progress.  Elevated test scores are an excellent point of fact.  Don’t be afraid to interpret statistics to make your school appear as good as possible.


'''Statement of Need'''


The statement of need is a carefully walked tightrope.  Essentially, the trick is to make the school appear clearly in need without seeming desperately needy.  In your statement of need, specifically state the materials you will need to make your project a success.  Again, don’t denigrate the school by making it sound excessively dilapidated (even if it is).  You want to give the impression that your school is a highly functional environment in spite of some of its economic hardships.  Never give the impression that the school is dysfunctional or unsafe.  Grant makers won’t fund you if they think their granted resources will be stolen.


'''Project Outline'''

The project outline is the heart of your grant.  Demonstrate to the reader that you have a precisely clear picture of your project.  Instrumental in developing an excellent project outline is the formulation of a good “hook.”  A “hook” is a special aspect of your grant that makes it stand out from your competitors.  Your “hook” should make your grant stand out, and it should demonstrate a degree of creativity in your planning.  A good &quot;hook&quot; might include ways of incorporating special needs students to tutor younger children or having ESL students learn English by working with artists.  

Include a clear timeline, and a definitive measurement for success.  State the number of clients the project will serve, and if the project can be carried into the following school-year.  Remember to make the project serve students, teachers, parents, administrators, and community members.  If possible, fit all this information onto a single page.


'''Budgeting'''

The budget authoring process is feared by many grant writers.  Different organizations have different rules about the nature of the budget they can fund, so research as much as possible before you get to pen the budget.  Many foundations have strict rules about the distribution of funding.  Some grant proposals stipulate that X% must be dedicated to teacher training (which is actually a good idea from their standpoint).  You need to know all those nuances before you start to write.  A good way of getting an indication is by reading mission statements.  

Be careful not to “gouge” the budget.  Budget “gouging” is when a grant writer applies for funding they don’t need, so they can use the money for something else.  When the grant gets funded, they use the original earmarked money for something entirely different.  Consider the following example of budget gouging:   A school has a technology budget of $30,000 to purchase hardware for a new lab.  Instead of buying the lab, they get a grant funded to pay for the lab.  Then, they use that $30,000 line item to buy office furniture and pay for substitutes.  

Grant makers are aware of budget gouging.  And, if they suspect you are conspiring with your administration to misrepresent yourself, they will immediately disqualify your proposal.  Therefore, it is best to keep honest when drafting your budget.

In summary, your budget should mirror your project proposal.  Keep it brief, modest, and honest.

== '''Implementing your Project''' ==




A grant isn’t truly successful until those educational objectives you began the process with are achieved.  The work isn’t done once the boxes arrive.  In fact, as any grant writer knows, no good deed goes unpunished.  A wealth of resources causes its own new set of problems.  

Teachers can be just like children.  You may have authored a successful grant that provided half your staff with laptops.  Suddenly, you find that the other half of the staff won’t talk to you.  Or, the people to whom you gave the machines either don’t know how or simply refuse to use them.  Or, they may complain that their Internet doesn’t work.  Or, they may complain that it’s no good without a printer.

Don’t be discouraged by a delusional sense of entitlement or pettiness your colleagues may exude.  These issues can be mineralized by clear communication.  If teachers are left to gossip about why only ½ the staff received resources, they will often come up with worst case scenario answers.  It may behoove you to send out a letter, have the administration issue some form of communication, or speak up at your monthly union meeting.  Whatever you do…it is best not to leave the teachers guessing.  

Furthermore, good communication will help you to get those teachers to “buy in” to facilitating those educational goals that you set out in your grant.  It helps to host teacher trainings with briefings and debriefings.  The same way you would never give a young child a laptop without first inspecting her/his degree of computer literacy, you should require teachers to participate in some type of training before you bequeath them the materials.  If not, you will find that many of the teachers will misuse them, infect them with malware, or never turn them on.  Then, you will find that they believe it is your responsibility to repair the broken resources because you delivered them.

== '''Thank the Donor''' ==




As with all things in life, it is a good idea to present the grant maker with some formal statement of thanks.  This statement may entail having students make “thank you” cards or inviting the donor to the school for some formal presentation.  The end objective should be to leave the grant maker with a feeling of appreciation.  A statement of thanks serves two purposes.  First, it demonstrates to all participating parties (the donor and the members of the school community) that positive progress is being made in your school culture.  Secondly, it will open the door to future opportunities between your school and the grant making organization.

== '''Maintaining Your Sanity''' ==
(a la Dr. Thane Terrill)


Writing and submitting a grant is no assurance the grant will be awarded.  Because grant makers, specifically grant readers, are fickle human beings like the rest of us, excellently penned grants often go unfunded, while grants may be awarded to writers of low quality proposals.  The awarding of grants seems very unfair at times, but don’t be discouraged because persistence will eventually pay.

It is a good idea to maintain a light hearted approach to grant writing.  If you expect grants you’ve written to pay out, there is a good chance you will be disappointed.  Grant writing isn’t like working at a typical job where you work hard, so you get paid.  When a grant gets funded, it is always a combination of hard work and good luck.  Keeping in mind that luck plays a factor, the best attitude to have is to constantly learn from your mistakes.

Although there is no assurance in the educational grant writing game, there are ways to increase your likelihood of success.  Think about it like a game of blackjack—you want to make discussions that will best improve your odds of success.  In a sense, you are gambling that all your hard work researching, establishing contacts, and writing will pay off.

      <comment>/* Third row of Gurmukhi */Fixed description of tone</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Punjabi/Navigation panel|Gurmukhi}}

Let us recall that besides vowels and diacritics you have already learnt the first ten letters of Gurmukhi viz. ੳ, ਅ, ੲ, ਸ, ਹ, ਕ, ਖ, ਗ, ਘ and ਙ. We now move on to the third row (ਚ ਵਰਗ). These letters are called ''palatals'' for they are articulated with the body of the tongue raised against the hard ''palate'', the middle part of the roof of the mouth.

== Third row of Gurmukhi ==

The third row of Gurmukhi consists of {{Listen|filename=GurmukhiPalatals.ogg|title=Third row|description=Play for names of these letters |format=[[Ogg]]}}
:&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਚ ਛ ਜ ਝ ਞ&lt;/span&gt;
These are called ਚ - ''chucha'', ਛ - ''chhuchha'', ਜ - ''jujja'', ਝ - ''jhujja'' and ਞ -''neya''. 
Their pronunciation is ਚ -/ch/, ਛ - /chh/, ਜ - /j/, ਝ - /jh/ and ਞ - /ny/.&lt;br&gt;We now briefly explain each of these 
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਚ&lt;/span&gt; Chucha : The eleventh letter of Gurmukhi is equivalent to /ch/ of English. Now, how do you write ''catch'' in Gurmukhi? I write it for you below
::ਕੈ + ਚ = ਕੈਚ = catch
:This example illustrates the use of ਚ as well as ਕ which you learnt in the last chapter. Here are some more examples illustrating the use of ਚ.
::ਚੈੱ + ਕ = ਚੈੱਕ = cheque 
::ਸੱ + ਚ = ਸੱਚ = such  
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਛ&lt;/span&gt; Chhuchha : There is no English equivalent of ਛ, the twelfth letter of Gurmukhi. It is the aspirated form of ਚ and is articulated the same way as ਚ with lots of breath being ejected from the mouth. Have a look at the following Punjabi example 
::ਛਾਂ /chhan/ = shade
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਜ&lt;/span&gt; Jujja : The thirteenth letter of Gurmukhi is equivalent to English /j/. Writting ''judge'' in Gurmukhi will illustrate its use.
::ਜੱ + ਜ = ਜੱਜ = judge 
:Here are some more illustrations
::ਜੱ + ਗ = ਜੱਗ = jug 
::ਜੈ + ਕ = ਜੈਕ = jack 
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਝ&lt;/span&gt; Jhujja : The fourteenth letter of Gurmukhi is not spoken in English. ਝ sound is produced by combining ਚ sound with a [[Punjabi/Phonetics#tone|tone]] in the initial position and a tone with ਜ sound elsewhere. Its use in Punjabi is not infrequent.
::ਝੱ + ਟ = ਝੱਟ /jhatt/ = instantly
::ਝੁ + ਗੀ = ਝੁਗੀ /jhuggii/ = cottage 
::ਝੰ + ਡਾ = ਝੰਡਾ /jhandhaa/ = flag
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਞ&lt;/span&gt; Neya : The twentieth letter of Gurmukhi is also not spoken in English. It is the nasalised version of /y/ sound in English and will be represented with /ny/. Its use in Punjabi is also becoming scarce. A marriage party in Punjabi is called
::ਜੰ + ਞ = ਜੰਞ = marriage party

== Exercises ==

1. Use Practice module to write the letters of the third row many times in your note book. You can click one of the letters below to go to relevant page of the practice module.
: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%; align: center;&quot;&gt;[[Punjabi/Gurmukhi/Practice/ਚ|ਚ]] [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi/Practice/ਛ|ਛ]] [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi/Practice/ਜ|ਜ]] [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi/Practice/ਝ|ਝ]] [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi/Practice/ਞ|ਞ]] &lt;/span&gt; 

2. Read these English words written in Gurmukhi
#ਚਾਕ

#ਇੰ + ਚ = ਇੰਚ
#ਇ + ਸ + ਚੂ = ਇਸਚੂ
#ਚਿ + ਕ  = ਚਿਕ
#ਈ + ਚ = ਈਚ
#ਜੰ + ਕ = ਜੰਕ }}

== Summary ==

In this chapter we have learnt the alphabets of the third row (ਚ ਵਰਗ) of Gurmukhi. The letters are ਚ called ''chucha'', ਛ called ''chhuchha'', ਜ called ''jujja'', ਝ called ''jhujja'' and ਞ called ''neya''. In the next lesson we will learn the alphabets of the fourth row.

===Nitrogen overview===

Nitrogen species are analysed as indicators of the health of salt lakes, providing information about the likelihood that the water body will support microalgal blooms. Nitrogen is a very labile element and is found in many forms, from simple oxidized inorganic nitrogen to complex proteins. 

[[File:NitrogenISSLR.jpg|frame|Typical N species in natural water samples]]

Considerable confusion can arise about what species of N are being tested and what units are being reported in nitrogen analysis. For example, the common ‘nitrate tests’ available in zinc-reduction field kits actually measure oxidized N in the form of nitrite, after the zinc reduces a known percentage of the nitrate present to nitrite, then the method calculates the quantity of nitrate, or of nitrogen, depending on the kit (Eaton ''et al'', 1995). Unfortunately, any nitrite present produces a high reading, which may be unquantifiable using colour chart type tests in the field. 

The choice of analyses depends on what you wish to understand about the salt lake you are studying, and whether you will be conducting the analyses in the field or in a laboratory.

'''Total oxidised nitrogen''' (N&lt;sub&gt;ox&lt;/sub&gt;) analysis measures the two types of nitrogen ('''nitrite''' and '''nitrate''') that are immediately available to plants in brine. Because of their immediate availability to plant life, testing for these species provides a useful indicator of a waterbody's ability to support a bloom. Separate '''nitrate''' (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''nitrite''' (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) test methods are also available that are suitable for either field or laboratory use.

'''Ammonium''' (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is a common nitrogenous pollutant that is toxic to many species in excess amounts. For fieldwork, it is possible to measure ammonium at the site, as the method does not require digestion. 

'''Total nitrogen''' (TN) is the most useful routine laboratory measure, as N is very labile and changes rapidly, both within the waterbody and in the removed sample. The full suite of nitrogen testing should be conducted where it is important to understand speciation within the waterbody. Should total nitrogen be required, use an appropriate method and analyse in the laboratory, as a high temperature digestion is required. Total nitrogen measures a combination of Kjeldahl (organic) nitrogen, oxidised nitrogen and ammonia. Subtracting oxidised nitrogen from total nitrogen provides a measure known as '''TKN (Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen)''' which is a sum of the organic N and ammonium components.  

When you wish to discover whether your salt lake is nitrogen or phosphorus limited, you need to measure an appropriate range of species. It is common to compare Total N to Total P ('''TN:TP''') or to compare dissolved inorganic N to dissolved inorganic P ('''DIN:DIP'''). The nitrogen tests required for DIN are the measures of total oxidised N (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).


===Sample handling===

Nitrogen may be fixed from the air by bacteria within the sample. Always fill sample jar to the top if it will be a while before testing. Keep samples cool and test on the day of collection.


===Notes about oxidised nitrogen analysis=== 

The two most common methods for the analysis of nitrate in saline waters are the cadmium reduction colorimetric method and the zinc powder reduction colorimetric method. Both methods are affected by the salinity of the sample.

Thomas and Chamberlin (1953) propose the use of a zinc powder reductant to avoid salt effects.  Despite  being adequate in salinities around that of sea-water, the method is impacted, physically, at higher salinities. High salt levels interfere with flocculation of the zinc reductant used in many field test kits, so dilution or filtration may be necessary. Most field test kits rely on gravity to 'floc' the zinc, and in dense brines the fine powder may not settle completely. Any zinc remaining in the sample will prevent the azo dye from developing its full colour causing underestimation of the oxidized nitrogen concentration, so the zinc must be removed completely. Diluting slightly hypersaline samples with distilled water(minimally) is one way to correct this. However dilution reduces the sensitivity of the method, so always use the minimal dilution possible. It is good practice not to exceed a 5 times dilution. Carefully quantify your dilution so that you can correct your results. Remember that the chance of error is lessened if you dilute a large ampunt of sample and then use an aliquot, rather than trying to measure tiny amounts of sample and diluent.

An alternative to dilution is to use a nitrate-free membrane filter (e.g. Supor) attached to a syringe to separate the reduced sample from the zinc powder. Make sure you do '''not''' use cellulose nitrate membrane filters!

Ghassemzadeh ''et al'' (1997) examined salt effects on the cadmium column reduction colorimetric method. They discovered a significant salt effect on this method. The authors felt that dilution was not always appropriate in highly saline samples, as the concentration of nitrate in the natural brines they were testing were very low, thus becoming undetectable with dilution.  The authors suggested that using spiked samples of varying salinities of brine from specific salt lakes would allow researchers to develop a salt effect correction formula that was specific to each lake they were studying. The authors provided a salt effect correction for hypesaline water derived from seawater. Such brines are common in coastal lagoons, salinas and commercial saltworks.

% salt error = -0.0007salinity&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 0.3322salinity + 1.1095

The r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the equation is 0.9638

 
===Notes about ammonium analysis===

Check the selected test method's sensitivity to salt and use an appropriate dilution, based on the salinity of your sample. Overly saline samples may affect the colour development of many ammonium test methods and this may be specified in the reagent manufacturer's notes. If no information on salinity effects has been provided, using a bracketed series of dilutions or a spiked sample will provide you with the information you need to determine what dilutions are appropriate and what colour changes indicate an overly saline sample.

==Uses, Limitations, Parameters and Options==
===Uses===
----
Intended to make a top section for a Wikibooks page so that the Table of Contents,(TOC), a block of text, and an image can line up horizontally.   Options allow multi-use of the three spaces.   This avoids the white space which usually results to the side of the TOC.

The template merges well, edge to edge, with another instance of the template following it.   Simply avoid any line breaks between the calls.

A wide range of options is given. 

It is called as follows:
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Thetop|background=ivory|leader=the top text|1=__TOC__|2=Two paragraphs here|3=[[image:ArialSpecimen.svg|200px|center]]|trailer=the bottom text}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}  

===Limitations===
----
Care must be taken to distinguish between the number 'one' and the lower case of the letter L.

Note that the widths are defaulted to percentage values, and that these units make sense only when the cell widths add to 100%.

====The Table in a Template Problem====
The template suffers from the usual problems when a wikitext table is used.   The method found to work for tables used as parameters is as follows:
* Make an ''HTML table'' from the wikitext table.
* Remove any ''cellspacing'' attribute from the table and a CSS style for spacing.
* Use a numbered or named parameter.
* Remove the wikitext apostrophe code headings and replace them with the HTML tag equivalents.  

Note that the leader and trailer parameters '''must be named''', and are lower case spellings. They do not use numbered parameters.  Line height could not be provided since it works only in a block element.   Use a text span if it is needed. 

===Parameters===
----
'''There are five parameters:'''

;leader:             fills a full width of the page at the top. '''Must be named.'''
;1&amp;nbsp;, theleft:   is the leftmost of three cells in a row   
;2&amp;nbsp;, themiddle: is the middle cell of the three cells 
;3&amp;nbsp;, theright:  is the rightmost cell of the three 
;trailer:            fills a full width of the page at the bottom. '''Must be named.'''

{{hiddenh4|The Parameter Layout; ''all parameter names are lower case''.}}
{{thetop|cp=10px|cp1=0 10px 0 20px|cp3=0 20px 0 10px|cs=0|bd=papayawhip|leader={{hiddenh3|This is the 'leader'}}It wraps text in the top section, all the way across the page.  '''If it is used, it must be named'''. If it is not used, it just collapses and is unseen. {{text}}|1={{hiddenh3|This is 'theleft'.}}It has a default width of 25%. {{text}}|2={{hiddenh3|This is 'themiddle'.}}It has a default width of 50%.{{text}}{{text}}|3={{hiddenh3|This is 'theright'.}}It has a default width of 25%. {{text}}|trailer={{hiddenh3|This is the 'trailer'.}}It wraps text in the bottom section all the way across the page.  '''If it is used, it must be named'''.  If it is not used, it just collapses and is unseen. {{text}}}}

The leader and trailer need not be used, while the three others will signify any omission.

;br:   Table perimeter border, defaults to 1px solid lightgrey

Great to see you found the book and edited it! Well done. I'm letting 80 third-year students loose on Wikiversity this semester to create e-portfolios of their learning journey - we'll see how that goes.

Found this page while exploring a list of uncategorized pages. It's generally worthy of deletion anyway (short stub, un-edited, old, etc) but I think it's also a copyright violation. At least, the note at the bottom of the page indicates that it was previously published. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:51, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

==1. Be able to identify at least one example of fifteen of the following seashore animals: ==
In other words, you need to be able to identify one animal from each of fifteen of the following twenty categories.
===a. Tunicate (Sea Squirt)  ===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Sea-tulip.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Pyura spinifera'' &lt;br&gt;(Sea Tulips)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Cionaintestinalis.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Ciona intestinalis'' &lt;br&gt;(Vase Tunicate)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Botrylloides violaceus.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Botrylloides violaceus'' &lt;br&gt;(Orange Sheath Tunicate)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Didemnum overgrowing dark green algae.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Didemnum spp.'' &lt;br&gt;(Colonial Tunicate)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Leucothea_pulchra.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Salpidae'' &lt;br&gt;(Salp)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Tunicate, also known as ''Urochordata'', tunicata (and by the common names of urochordates, sea squirts, and sea pork) is the subphylum of a group of underwater saclike filter feeders with incurrent and excurrent siphons, that are members of the phylum Chordata. Most tunicates feed by filtering sea water through pharyngeal slits, but some are sub-marine predators such as the ''Megalodicopia hians''.

===b. Anemone (Sea Flower)  ===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Urticina piscivora 1.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Urticina piscivora'' &lt;br&gt;(Fish-eating anemone)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Fly-trap anemone.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Family ''Hormathiidae''&lt;br&gt;(Fly-trap Anemone)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Sea anemone in tidepools.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Anthopleura sola'' &lt;br&gt;(Sunburst Anemone)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Sea anemones are a group of water dwelling, predatory animals of the order Actiniaria; they are named after the anemone, a terrestrial flower. As cnidarians, sea anemones are closely related to corals, jellyfish, tube-dwelling anemones and Hydra.

===c. Chiton  ===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Tonicella-lineata.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Tonicella lineata'' &lt;br&gt;(Lined Chiton)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Acanthopleura spinosa 01 Pengo.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Acanthopleura spinosa'' &lt;br&gt; (Spiny Chiton)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Chitons live attached to rocks in shallow water.  The Chiton feeds mainly on plants of the sea, removing the plant with its radula (rough tongue).  They glide using a massive foot.  Their back is covered with eight heavy armor-like dorsal plates.

===d. Hermit Crab  ===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Hermit crab cropped.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Clibanarius tricolor''&lt;br&gt;(Blue-legged Hermit Crab)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Coenobita clypeatus1.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Coenobita clypeatus''&lt;br&gt;(Caribbean hermit crab)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:DirkvdM hermit crab.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Coenobita compressus''&lt;br&gt;(Ecuadorian hermit crab)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Most species of hermit crabs have long soft abdomens which are protected from predators by the adaptation of carrying around a salvaged empty seashell, into which the whole crab's body can retract. Most frequently hermit crabs utilize the shells of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks. The tip of the hermit crab's abdomen is adapted to clasp strongly onto the columella of the snail shell. As the hermit crab grows in size it has to find a larger shell and abandon the previous one.Hermit crabs live in the wild in colonies of 100 or more, and do not thrive in smaller numbers

===e. Brittle Star or Serpent Star===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Greenbrittlestar.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Green brittle star&lt;br&gt;(''Ophiarachna sp.'')&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Reef2589.jpg|&lt;center&gt;reticulated brittle star&lt;br&gt;(''Ophionereis reticulata'') &lt;/center&gt;
Image:Giant red brittlestar.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Giant red brittlestar&lt;br&gt;''Ophioderma sp.'' &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Brittle stars are echinoderms, closely related to starfish. They crawl across the sea-floor using their flexible arms as &quot;legs&quot; for locomotion. The Brittle star generally have five long slender, whip-like arms which may reach up to 60 centimeters (2 feet) in length on the largest specimens.There are some 1,500 species of brittle stars living today, and they are largely found in deep waters more than 500 metres (1,650 feet) down.

===f. Sea Urchin  ===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;
Image:Strongylocentrotus purpuratus P1160330.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Strongylocentrotus purpuratus'' &lt;/center&gt;
Image:Paracentrotus lividus.001 - Aquarium Finisterrae.JPG|&lt;center&gt;''Paracentrotus lividus'' &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Sea Urchins are small, spiny sea creatures of the class Echinoidea found in oceans all over the world. (The name urchin is an old name for the round spiny hedgehogs sea urchins resemble.) Their shell, which is also called the &quot;test&quot;, is globular in shape and covered with spines. The size of an adult test is typically from 3 to 10 cm.Typical sea urchins have spines that are 1 to 3 cm in length, 1 to 2 mm thick, and not terribly sharp. Common colors include black and dull shades of green, olive, brown, purple, and red.

===g. Sea Cucumber  ===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Sea cucumber.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Trachythyone elongata''&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Sea Cucumber.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Thymiosycia hilla''&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Three-Rowed Sea Cucumber.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Three-Rowed Sea Cucumber&lt;br&gt;(''Isostichopus badionotus'')&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The sea cucumber is an echinoderm of the class Holothuroidea, with an elongated body and leathery skin, which is found on the sea floor worldwide. It is so named because of its cucumber-like shape. Like all echinoderms, sea cucumbers have an endoskeleton just below the skin, but this can actually be absent in some species

===h. Bryozoa colony (Moss animal)  ===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200&gt;
Image:Reteporella grimaldii.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Reteporella grimaldii''&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Schizobrachiella sanguinea.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Schizobrachiella sanguinea''&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Costazia costazi.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Costazia costazi''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Bryozoans are tiny colonial animals that generally build stony skeletons of calcium carbonate, superficially similar to coral. They are also known as moss animals (which is the literal Greek translation) or sea mats. They generally prefer warm, tropical waters but are known to occur worldwide. There are about 5,000 living species, with several times that number of fossil forms known.

===i. Barnacle  ===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;
Image:Chthamalus stellatus.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Chthamalus stellatus''&lt;br&gt;(Poli's Stellate Barnacle)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Balanus glandula01.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Balanus glandula''&lt;br&gt;(White Acorn Barnacle)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Seepocke fg02.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Semibalanus balanoides''&lt;br&gt;(Rock Barnacle)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
A barnacle is a type of arthropod belonging to infraclass ''Cirripedia'' in the subphylum ''Crustacea'', and is hence distantly related to crabs and lobsters. Around 1,220 barnacle species are currently known. The name &quot;Cirripedia&quot; is Latin, meaning &quot;curl-footed&quot;.

===j. Sea Star ===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;
Image:Red-knobbed.starfish.arp.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Protoreaster linckii''&lt;br&gt;(Red-knobbed Starfish)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Sunflower sea star.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Pycnopodia helianthoides''&lt;br&gt;(Sunflower Starfish)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Starfish.JPG|&lt;center&gt;''Oreaster reticulatus''&lt;br&gt;(Cushion Sea Star)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Starfish or sea stars are any echinoderms belonging to the class Asteroidea. The names sea star and starfish are also (incorrectly) used for the closely related brittle stars, which make up the class Ophiuroidea.They typically have five or more &quot;arms&quot; which radiate from an indistinct disk (pentaradial symmetry). Starfish do not rely on a jointed, movable skeleton for support and locomotion (although they are protected by their skeleton), but instead possess a hydraulic water vascular system that aids in locomotion. The water vascular system has many projections called tube feet on the bottom side of the starfish's arms which function in locomotion and aid with feeding.

===k. Mussel or Clamworm===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Nereis succinea (epitoke).jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Nereis succinea''&lt;br&gt;(Common Clam Worm)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Nereis diversicolor 1.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Nereis diversicolor''&lt;br&gt;(Ragworm)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Clamworms are predominantly marine organisms that may occasionally swim upstream to rivers and even climb to land (for example Lycastopsis catarractarum). They are commonly found in all water depths, foraging in seaweeds, hiding under rocks or burrowing in sand or mud. Nereids are mainly omnivorous but many are active carnivores.

===l. Sea Jelly===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Jellyfish.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Chrysaora quinquecirrha''&lt;br&gt;(Stinging Sea Nettle)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Ripleys jellyfish.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Aurelia aurita''&lt;br&gt;(Crystal Jellyfish )&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Blubber Jellyfish 1.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Catostylus mosaicus''&lt;br&gt;(Blubber Jellyfish)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Jellyfish are marine invertebrates belonging to the class Scyphozoa of the phylum Cnidaria. They can be found in every ocean in the world and in some fresh waters. They are found drifting in the ocean either by themselves or in great schools.  Each has a bell-shaped hollow body with tentacles used for catching food.

===m. Limpet===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Napfschnecken Galizien2005.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Patella vulgata''&lt;br&gt;(Common Limpet)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The name Limpet is used for many kinds of mostly saltwater but also freshwater snails, specifically those that have a simple shell which is more or less broadly conical in shape, and which is either not coiled, or appears not to be coiled, in the adult snail.

Thus the word &quot;limpet&quot; is an inexact term, which is fairly often used as part of the common name of a wide variety of different marine and freshwater gastropod species, some of which have gills and some of which have a lung. The name is given on the basis of a limpet-like or &quot;patelliform&quot; shell, but the several groups of snails which have such a shell are not at all closely related to one another.

===n. Tube Worm===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:CyprusPlioceneGastropod.JPG|&lt;center&gt;A fossilized tube-dwelling serpulid worm attached to the shell of a gastropod.&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Nur04505.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Riftia pachyptila''&lt;br&gt;(Giant tube worm)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The name tube worm may refer to any of a number of unrelated tube-dwelling worm-like invertebrates.

These include chiefly various polychaetes, specifically the family Siboglinidae (beard worms), Serpulidae, and related families of the order Canalipalpata. Other groups also called tube worms include members of the phylum Phoronida (horseshoe worms).

===o. Oyster===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Ostrea edulis p1040847.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Crassostrea gigas''&lt;br&gt;(Pacific Oyster)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Sydney rock oysters.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Saccostrea glomerata''&lt;br&gt;(Sydney Rock Oyster)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Pinctada margaritifera.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Pinctada margaritifera''&lt;br&gt;(Pearl Oyster)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The common name oyster is used for a number of different groups of bivalve mollusks, most of which live in marine habitats or brackish water. The shell consists of two usually highly calcified valves which surround a soft body. Gills filter plankton from the water, and strong adductor muscles are used to hold the shell closed.Some of the groups known as oysters, also known as mullusks (true oysters), are highly prized as food, both raw and cooked (though the Bible categorizes them as unclean, and therefore unfit as human food). Some other groups also called oysters, such as pearl oysters, are not widely eaten, at least not since recent times.
True (edible) oysters are incapable of making gem-quality pearls, although the opposite idea is a commonly-encountered misapprehension, often seen in illustrations or photographs where an edible oyster shell is mistakenly paired with a gem-quality pearl.

===p. Amphipod (Sand Flea)===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Hyperia.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Hyperia macrocephala''&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Pariambus typicus.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Pariambus typicus''&lt;br&gt;(Skeleton shrimp)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Gammarus roeselii.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Gammarus roeselii''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Amphipoda (amphipods) is an order of animals that includes over 7,000 described species of small, shrimp-like crustaceans.Most amphipods are marine; although a small number of species are limnic or terrestrial. Marine amphipods may be pelagic (living in the water column) or benthic (living on the ocean bottom). Pelagic amphipods are eaten by seabirds, fish, and marine mammals. Terrestrial amphipods such as sand fleas can often be seen amongst sand and pebbles or on beaches.

===q. Sponge===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Aphrocallistes vastus.jpg |&lt;center&gt;''Aphrocallistes vastus''&lt;br&gt;(Cloud Sponge)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Tedaria ignis.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Tedaria ignis''&lt;br&gt;(Fire Sponge)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Ophiocoma echinata on Agelas clathordes.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Agelas clathrodes)''&lt;br&gt;(Orange Elephant Ear Sponge, behind a brittle star)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The sponges or poriferans (from Latin porus &quot;pore&quot; and ferre &quot;to bear&quot;) are animals of the phylum Porifera. Porifera translates to &quot;Pore-bearer&quot;. They are primitive, sessile, mostly marine, water dwelling filter feeders that pump water through their bodies to filter out particles of food matter. Sponges represent the simplest of animals. With no true tissues (parazoa), they lack muscles, nerves, and internal organs. There are over 5,000 modern species of sponges known, and they can be found attached to surfaces anywhere from the intertidal zone to as deep as 8,500 m (29,000 feet) or further.

===r. Sand Dollar===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Keyhole sand dollar 01.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Mellita quinquiesperforata''&lt;br&gt;(Keyhole sand dollar)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Reef0260.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Clypeaster reticulatus''&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Echinocyamus pusillus.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Echinocyamus pusillus''&lt;br&gt;(Pea Urchin)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Sand dollars are in the Echinoid (Echinoderms) class of marine animals. When they are living, they are covered with a suit of moveable spines that encompass the entire shell. Like its close relative the sea urchin, the sand dollar has a set of five pores arranged in a petal pattern. The pores are used to move sea water into its internal water-vascular system, which allows the creature to move.Sand dollars live beyond mean low water on top of or just beneath the surface of sandy or muddy areas. The spines on the somewhat flattened underside of the animal allow it to burrow or to slowly creep through the sand. Fine, hair-like cilia cover the tiny spines. Tubefeet or podia that line the food grooves, move food to the mouth opening which is in the center of the star shaped grooves on the underside of the animal called the oral surface. Its food consists of crustacean larvae, small copepods, detritus, diatoms, algae and organic particles that end up in the sandy bottom.On the ocean bottom, sand dollars are frequently found together.

===s. Coral===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Montastrea cavernosa.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Montastrea cavernosa''&lt;br&gt;(Cavernous Star Coral )&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Orange cup coral (Balanophyllia elegans) 01.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Balanophyllia elegans''&lt;br&gt;(Orange cup coral)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Trachyphyllia geoffroyi.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Trachyphyllia geoffroyi''&lt;br&gt;(Brain Coral)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Corals are skeletal remains of marine organisms from the class Anthozoa and exist as small sea anemone–like polyps, typically in colonies of many identical individuals. The group includes the important reef builders that are found in tropical oceans, which secrete calcium carbonate to form a hard skeleton.Over thousands of generations, the polyps lay down a skeleton that is characteristic of their species. A head of coral grows by asexual reproduction of the individual polyps. Corals also breed sexually by spawning, with corals of the same species releasing gametes simultaneously over a period of one to several nights around a full moon.Although corals can catch plankton using stinging cells on their tentacles, these animals obtain most of their nutrients from symbiotic unicellular algae called zooxanthellae. Consequently, most corals depend on sunlight and grow in clear and shallow water, typically at depths shallower than 60 m (200 ft).

===t. Ghost Crab===
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Yellow crab.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Ocypode quadrata''&lt;br&gt;(Yellow Crab)&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Sunagani060612.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Ocypode stimpsoni''&lt;br&gt;( )&lt;/center&gt;
Image:BBayCrab2.jpg|&lt;center&gt;''Ocypode cordimana''&lt;br&gt;(Common Ghost Crab)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Ghost crabs, also called sand crabs, are crabs of the genus Ocypode, common shore crabs in many countries. In the eastern United States, Ocypode quadrata is frequently seen scurrying along beaches between sunset and dawn.These crabs are called ghosts because of their ability to disappear from sight almost instantly, scuttling at speeds up to 10 miles per hour, while making sharp directional changes. These creatures have two black eyes, with sharp 360° vision which they use to see flying insects and catch them in mid air. The ghost crab, however, cannot see directly up, so it must burrow into the ground to prevent birds from catching it.The ghost crab tunnels down four feet into the ground at a 45° angle, creating 1-2 inch wide holes, which speckle the beach. At dusk, these crabs will sprint to the ocean in order to obtain oxygen from the water which washes over their gills, and in June, females will release their eggs into the ocean. Ghost crabs hibernate during the winter, holding their breath for six months, by storing oxygen in sacs near the gills. They can also have a natural filter system which gathers oxygen from the air humans breathe, enough to survive for one year without entering into water.

==2. Make a collection or photographs of the following seashore animals: &lt;br&gt;a. Three kinds of crabs &lt;br&gt;b. One kind of sea star &lt;br&gt;c. Any other five animals listed in requirement 1. Hard-bodied animals, such as crabs, sea star, and chitons, may be killed in a 5% solution of formaldehyde or a 70% solution of alcohol, and then dried by a fire. The sun will cause the color to fade. Soft-bodied animals must be kept in a 3% solution of formaldehyde or a 70% solution of alcohol. If commercial formalin is used in place of formaldehyde, the above percentage figures should be doubled. ==
Pathfinders are encouraged to take photographs of these animals rather than killing them.  Descriptions of each of these animals can be found above in requirement 1.

==3. Describe the following processes: ==
===a. The swimming action of a sea jelly ===
Most jellyfish are passive drifters and slow swimmers, as their shape is not hydrodynamic. Instead, they move so as to create a current forcing the prey within reach of their tentacles. They do this by rhythmically opening and closing their bell-like body.

===b. The method of an anemone capturing food ===
When small fish or other sea creatures swim by the sea anemone's tentacles, the tentacles will paralyze the creature with so-called stinging or nettle cells, which throw out barbed threads.  The tentacles drag the paralyzed creature to the mouth in the center of the sea anemone.

===c. The running of a crab ===
Crabs run sideways on the tips of their claws.

===d. How does a sea star digest a clam or oyster when it has such a small mouth opening? ===
They have two stomachs. One stomach is used for digestion, and the other stomach can be extended outward to engulf and digest prey. This feature allows the starfish to hunt prey that is much larger than its mouth would otherwise allow.

==4. Name four low-tide animals and two high-tide animals. ==
&lt;gallery caption=Low-tide Animals perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==5. Answer the following questions on relationships: ==
===a. What relationship do crabs and barnacles have to insects? ===
Each body section is closely jointed.  Each section usually bears a pair of jointed legs.  The eyes are compound.

===b. What relationship does the sea squirt have to man? ===
The larva has a rod-like &quot;backbone&quot;

===c. Name a common land dweller that is related to the clamworm. ===
Earth worm

===d. The octopus belongs to the phylum Mollusca. Which two animals listed in No. 1 are related to the octopus? ===
Oyster and Chitons

===e. Sea star, sea cucumber, and sea urchin all belong to the phylum Echinodermata. Why do they belong together? (Clue: Find out what &quot;Echinodermata&quot; means.) ===
They belong together because they are spiny-skinned animals.

==6. Give an oral report on two of the following activities: ==
===a. Visit a seashore at night and by means of a flashlight observe the activity of animals on shore and in the water. Notice the many plants and animals visible when the beam of light is directed into the water. These minute organisms are called plankton.=== 
This is a fun activity to do if you find yourself at a beach at night.  If you have the opportunity, plan a campout near a beach.  Some clubs might use an overnight trip to the beach as an incentive for the merit points system.

===b. Tow a fine-mesh cloth or regular plankton net through the water and observe through a microscope the many tiny animals and plants that are collected. ===
This is somewhat easier to accomplish that the previous activity, as most people go to the beach during the day and then have to leave before it gets dark to return home at a reasonable hour.  Tow the mesh through the water several times, and then turn it inside-out in a jar of sea water.  Repeat several times so that the jar of sea water ends up with a high concentration of sea life.  When you have access to a microscope, place a drop of water on a slide and examine it.
===c. Select three items under #1 that are important economically. Explain why they are important.===
*Many of the animals in requirement #1 are beautiful to look at, and this makes them a tourist attraction in many areas.  The economy of such places is ''built'' on tourism, and these animals are an important part of the draw.

*Hermit crabs are sold as pets.

*Though none of the animals listed here are Biblically clean, many of them are eaten.  Entire communities base their economies on the catching of shell fish such as oysters, clams, crabs, and mussels.  Some, such as the sea urchin, are served as delicacies

*Plankton (such as shrimp and sand fleas) are positioned at the base of the food chain, providing nutrients to larger fish which are then eaten by humans.

      <comment>/* Sixth row of Gurmukhi */Fixed description of tone.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Punjabi/Navigation panel|Gurmukhi}}

You have already learnt the ''velars'', ''palatals'', ''retroflexes'' and ''dentals'' besides the vowel carriers and ਸ and ਹ. In this lesson we will learn the letters of the sixth row (ਪ ਵਰਗ) of Gurmukhi consisting the Labials. The Labials are articulated either with lips.

== Sixth row of Gurmukhi ==

The letters of the sixth row of Gurmukhi are {{Listen|filename=GurmukhiLabials.ogg|title=Sixth row|description=Play for names of these letters|format=[[Ogg]]}}
:&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:200%&quot;&gt;ਪ ਫ ਬ ਭ ਮ&lt;/span&gt;
They are called ਪ  - ''puppa'', ਫ - ''phupha'', ਬ - ''bubba'', ਭ - ''bhubba'' and  ਮ - ''mumma''. Their pronunciation is ਪ - /p/, ਫ - /ph/, ਬ - /b/, ਭ - /bh/ and ਮ - /m/.&lt;br&gt;Each of them is explained below.
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:200%&quot;&gt;ਪ&lt;/span&gt; Puppa : This is how words ''peach'' and ''pass'' are written in Gurmukhi
::ਪੀ + ਚ = ਪੀਚ = peach 
::ਪਾ + ਸ = ਪਾਸ = pass 
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:200%&quot;&gt;ਫ&lt;/span&gt; Phupha : ਫ is equivalent to /ph/. For illustration of the use of ਫ see these example
::ਫੋ + ਟੋ = ਫੋਟੋ = photo 
:'''NB''' : We have used /ph/ to denote that this sound which is produced by closing both lips (bilabial) is aspirated version of the plosive /p/. The English /f/ or /ph/ are in fact labio-dental fricatives. See [[Punjabi/Phonetics|Phonetics]] for more details.
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:200%&quot;&gt;ਬ&lt;/span&gt; Bubba : ਬ is equivalent to /b/. The words ''bus'' and ''biscuit'' are written in Gurmukhi as
::ਬੱ + ਸ = ਬੱਸ = bus &lt;br&gt;
::ਬਿ + ਸ + ਕੁ + ਟ = ਬਿਸਕੁਟ = biscuit 
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:200%&quot;&gt;ਭ&lt;/span&gt; Bhubba : There is no equivalent of ਭ in English. ਭ sound is produced by combining ਪ with [[Punjabi/Phonetics#tone|tone]] in initial position of a word and a tone with ਬ sound elsewhere. Here are some Punjabi examples.
::ਭਾ + ਰ = ਭਾਰ /bhaar/ = weight
::ਭਾ + ਗ = ਭਾਗ /bhaag/ = part
::ਭਾ + ਲੂ = ਭਾਲੂ /bhaloo/ = bear
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:200%&quot;&gt;ਮ&lt;/span&gt; Mumma : Let's now go to the last letter of this row which is ਮ and is equivalent to /m/. We have already seen Gurmukhi transcription of ''Pyjama''(ਪ + ਜਾ + ਮਾ = ਪਜਾਮਾ) above which illustrates use of ਮ. Here are some examples.
::ਮਿੰ + ਟ = ਮਿੰਟ /mint/ = minute 
::ਮੈ + ਨ = ਮੈਨ = man

== Exercises ==

      <comment>/* Fourth row of Gurmukhi */Fixed descrition of tone.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Punjabi/Navigation panel|Gurmukhi}}

This chapter will be devoted to the fourth row (ਟ ਵਰਗ ) of Gurmukhi consisting of five letters called the Retroflexes. 
They are so called because of the manner of articulation by touching the roof of the mouth by a curled up tongue with a flap.

== Fourth row of Gurmukhi ==

The letters of the fourth row of Gurmukhi are {{Listen|filename=GurmukhiRetroflexes.ogg|title=Fourth row|description=Play for names of these letters|format=[[Ogg]]}}
:&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਟ ਠ ਡ ਢ ਣ&lt;/span&gt;
These are called ਟ - ''tainka'', ਠ - ''thutha'', ਡ - ''dudda'', ਢ - ''dhuda'' and  ਣ -''nhanha''. They are pronounced as ਟ - /t/, ਠ - /th/, ਡ - /d/, ਢ - /dh/ and ਣ - /nh/.&lt;br&gt;
Each of these letters is explained below.
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਟ&lt;/span&gt; Tainka : The twenty first letter of Gurmukhi is equivalent to English /t/. Transcription of ''tank'' and ''test'' shall demonstrate its use.
::ਟੈਂ + ਕ = ਟੈਂਕ = tank 
::ਟੈ + ਸ + ਟ = ਟੈਸਟ = test 
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਠ&lt;/span&gt; Thutha : The twenty second letter is not spoken in English. Nevertheless there are words in some Asian languages which are familiar to and are spoken by speakers of English language and which illustrate the use of this sound. For example the word ''thug'' will be written in Gurmukhi as under
::ਠੱ + ਗ = ਠੱਗ = thug
: Kathmandu is the capital city of Nepal. The first part (we will come back to the other part later) ''Kath'' of Kathmandu will be written in Gurmukhi as
::ਕ + ਠ  = ਕਠ = Kath
:ਠ is an aspirated form of /t/. This implies that its sound is produced the same way as /t/ but by simultaneously exhaling lots of breath. So speaking /t/ continuously and throwing lots of breath out of the mouth will correctly produce this sound.
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਡ&lt;/span&gt; Dudda : ਡ is equivalent to English /d/. The words ''desk'' and ''date'' will demonstrate its use.
::ਡੈ + ਸ + ਕ = ਡੈਸਕ = desk 
::ਡੇ + ਟ = ਡੇਟ = date 
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਢ&lt;/span&gt; Dhudda : ਢ sound is produced by combining ਟ sound with a [[Punjabi/Phonetics#tone|tone]] in the initial position of a word and with a tone and ਡ sound elsewhere. This is how the word ''Dhaka'', the Bagladesh capital, will be transcribed in Gurmukhi
::ਢਾ + ਕਾ = ਢਾਕਾ = Dhaka 
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਣ&lt;/span&gt; Nahnha : The last letter ਣ of this row is not spoken in English. It is similar to /n/ except that instead of tongue touching the teeth, it touches the roof of the mouth with a flap. To produce the sound ਣ /nh/ continue to repeat /n/ and simultaneously touch the roof of the mouth with a flap. ''Haryana'', a state of India, will be written as
::ਹ + ਰਿ + ਆ + ਣਾ = ਹਰਿਆਣਾ /Hariaanhaa/ = Haryana
: No Punjabi word starts with this letters.

== Exercises ==

1. Use Practice module to write the letters of the fourth row many times in your note book as you did earlier. You can click one of the letters below to go to relevant page of the practice module.

#ਸੂ + ਡਾ + ਨ = ਸੂਡਾਨ}}

== Summary ==

In this lesson we have learnt the five letters of the fourth row of Gurmukhi script. We found that ਠ ''thutha'', ਢ ''dhudda'' and ਣ ''nahnha'' sounds are not spoken in English but we found a way to produce these sounds by relating them to other similar sounds. We also found that letter ਣ never occupies the initial position in any Punjabi word.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Optimal classification''' refers to any method of classification&lt;ref&gt;Although classification elements and attributes and decision actions and conditions may employ tables and trees there are important differences in how each is defined.

A classification table or tree is defined by having an element with at least one attribute with at least one value and may have more than one element, attribute or attribute value but ''may not have more than one element per rule''.  

On the other hand, a decision table or tree may have more than one condition per rule, more than one state per condition and ''more than one action per rule''.
 &lt;/ref&gt;, which ''inexclusively'' minimizes the number of queries necessary to identify a particular '''element''' within a [[w:Bounded (set theory)|'''bounded''']] class&lt;ref&gt;A '''''bounded''' class'' is a collection of elements defined by the same finite '''''group''''' of attributes.&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <comment>/* Fifth row of Gurmukhi */Fixed description of tone</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Punjabi/Navigation panel|Gurmukhi}}

We have already learnt the velars, palatals and retroflexes besides the vowel carriers and ਸ and ਹ. We now move on to the fifth row (ਤ ਵਰਗ ) of Gurmukhi 
consisting of the dentals. The dentals are so called because of the fact that they are articulated with the tongue touching the upper teeth.

== Fifth row of Gurmukhi ==

The letters of the fifth row of Gurmukhi are {{Listen|filename=GurmukhiDentals.ogg|title=Fifth row|description=Play for names of these letters|format=[[Ogg]]}}
:&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਤ ਥ ਦ ਧ ਨ&lt;/span&gt;
These are called ਤ - ''&lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;u&lt;u&gt;tt&lt;/u&gt;a'', ਥ - ''&lt;u&gt;th&lt;/u&gt;u&lt;u&gt;thth&lt;/u&gt;a'', ਦ - ''&lt;u&gt;d&lt;/u&gt;u&lt;u&gt;dd&lt;/u&gt;a'', ਧ - ''&lt;u&gt;dh&lt;/u&gt;u&lt;u&gt;dd&lt;/u&gt;a'' and  ਨ - ''nunna''. They are pronounced ਤ - /&lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;/, ਥ - /&lt;u&gt;th&lt;/u&gt;/, ਦ - /&lt;u&gt;d&lt;/u&gt;/, ਧ - /&lt;u&gt;dh&lt;/u&gt;/ and ਨ - /n/.&lt;br&gt;Each of these letters is explained below.

:&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਤ&lt;/span&gt; &lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;u&lt;u&gt;tt&lt;/u&gt;a : ਤ sound is not found in English. It is produced the same way as /t/ except that instead of the tongue touching the roof of the mouth it touches the teeth. The world famous monument of love ''Taj'' is spelt in Gurmukhi as
::ਤਾ + ਜ = ਤਾਜ = Taj
:''Tibet'' will be written in Gurmukhi as under
::ਤਿੱ + ਬ + ਤ = ਤਿੱਬਤ = Tibet
:ਤ /&lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;/ is a dental sound. It is produced the same way as /t/ but by placing the tongue against the upper teeth, as is done to produce th sound in ''then''. To produce ਤ sound repeat the /t/ sound and continue to do so by placing the tongue against the upper teeth. This will produce the ਤ sound.
:&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਥ&lt;/span&gt; &lt;u&gt;Th&lt;/u&gt;u&lt;u&gt;thth&lt;/u&gt;a : ਥ is same as /th/ in thank. Let us see some examples of its use in English words
::ਥੈਂ + ਕ = ਥੈਂਕ = thank 
::ਥੀ + ਸਿ + ਸ = ਥੀਸਿਸ = thesis
::ਥਿੱ + ਕ = ਥਿੱਕ = thick
:&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਦ&lt;/span&gt; &lt;u&gt;D&lt;/u&gt;u&lt;u&gt;dd&lt;/u&gt;a : ਦ is equivalent to /th/ as in the. Here are some examples of its use in English words
::ਦਿੱ + ਸ = ਦਿੱਸ = this 
::ਦੈ + ਟ = ਦੈਟ = that 
:&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਧ&lt;/span&gt; &lt;u&gt;Dh&lt;/u&gt;u&lt;u&gt;dd&lt;/u&gt;aa : ਧ has no equivalent in English. ਧ sound is produced by speaking ਤ combined with a [[Punjabi/Phonetics#tone|tone]] in an initial position of a word and a tone with ਦ sound elsewhere.
::ਬੁੱ + ਧਾ = ਬੁੱਧਾ /Bu&lt;u&gt;dh&lt;/u&gt;aa/ = Buddha
:&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਨ&lt;/span&gt; Nuna : ਨ is equivalent to /n/. Let us see some examples of use of ਨ in English words written in Gurmukhi
::ਨੈੱ + ਟ = ਨੈੱਟ = net 
::ਨਿ + ਬ = ਨਿਬ = nib 
::ਨੋ + ਟ = ਨੋਟ = note

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Resistors''' are passive devices, meaning that they cannot provide any power gain (amplification). They have a linear IV characteristic, meaning that the voltage across the resistor is directly proportional to the current through the resistor. The coefficient of proportionality is called the '''resistance''' (R). This is Ohm's Law:

:&lt;math&gt;V=IR&lt;/math&gt;

==Resistor's Characteristics==
===Resistance===
[[Image:Resistor_symbol_Europe.svg|frame|ISO standard resistor symbol|left]]
[[Image:Resistor_symbol_America.svg|frame|Old-fashioned, but common, American resistor symbol|right]]












Resistors have the symbol on the right. Resistance is defined as the voltage developed across the resistor per ampere of current through the resistor. Resistance has a symbol of R measured in unit called Ohm which has a symbol Ω.

:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{V}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

===Conductance===
Conductance is the reciprocal of resistance (current per unit voltage), and is given the symbol ''G'' and the units ''siemens'' with symbol ''S''.

:&lt;math&gt;G = \frac{1}{R} = \frac{I}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

===Resistor's Construction===
If we assume a resistor to be made of a prismatic (invariant cross-sectional area A along its length) conductor with length ''l'', and conductivity ''ρ'', we can express the conductance as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;G = \rho \frac{A}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

Form above, conductivity of materials can be calculated by
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{I}{V} \frac{l}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

When a resistor is connected with a DC source voltage, the resistance is calculated by Ohm's law:
:;&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{V}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

When a resistor is connected with an AC voltage source, voltage and current in the resistor have zero phase difference. The impedance of a resistor is calculated in the same way as in the DC case:
:&lt;math&gt;Z_R = \frac{V}{I} = R&lt;/math&gt;

==Identification==
Resistors used in practical electronics range from one ohm to several million ohms
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
!Resistance in Ohms!!Unit!!Symbol
|-
|1||Ohm||align=&quot;center&quot;|&amp;Omega;
|-
|1,000||Kilo-ohm||align=&quot;center&quot;|K&amp;Omega;
|-
|1,000,000||Megaohm||align=&quot;center&quot;|M&amp;Omega;
|}

Often a shorthand is used which means that the &amp;Omega; symbol, which is usually not easily accessed on a computer, is not needed. The shorthand also eliminates the need for decimal points which are sometimes lost or missed off when documents are copied. The shorthand works by replacing a decimal point with the prefix of the resistance (e.g. K for kilo-ohms) or, for resistances in just ohms, R:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
!Standard Notation!!Shorthand Notation
|-
|1 &amp;Omega;||1R
|-
|1.2 &amp;Omega;||1R2
|-
|1 K&amp;Omega;||1K
|-
|1.2 K&amp;Omega;||1K2
|}

This notation is preferred, and will be used in this book. please note that the resistances are still ''said'' the same, so the value of a 1K2 resistor is pronounced &quot;one point two kilo-ohms&quot;. The shorthand is not used when we are not talking about an individual resistor, for example, when measuring the resistance of a combination of resistors, we then express the value in ohms.

Resistors are not made perfect, and so they each have a '''tolerance'''. This is the maximum that a resistor can deviate from its specified value. It is expressed in percent, and the standard tolerance is 10%, which is more than adequate for most of our needs.

===Preferred Values===

To prevent thousands of different values of resistors clogging everything up, resistors only come in specified values. These values are spread across multiples of ten so that each is a constant multiple of the one beneath. The number of divisions per multiple of ten (decade) depends on the tolerance of the resistors. Standard (10%) resistors belong to the '''E12''' series. The values are spread according to the rounded results of the following rule:

::&lt;math&gt;R_n=R_{n-1} \times \sqrt[12]{10}&lt;/math&gt;

These numbers are:

 1.0 1.2 1.5 1.8 2.2 2.7 3.3 3.9 4.7 5.6 6.8 8.2

After that, the cycle repeats, but a power of ten higher. Therefore, the first three decades are as follows:

  1R  1R2  1R5  1R8  2R2  2R7  3R3  3R9  4R7  5R6  6R8  8R2
 10R  12R  15R  18R  22R  27R  33R  39R  47R  56R  68R  82R
 100R 120R 150R 180R 220R 270R 330R 390R 470R 560R 680R 820R

This pattern continues right up to the top of the resistor values that are available. For more accurate resistors, there exists an E24 (5%), E96 (1%) and an E192 (0.5%) series. There is also an E6 series for 20% resistors. To see a list of all values in these series, see this [[Practical_Electronics/Preferred Values|appendix]].

Another way to understand the choice of resistor values in a given series (based on tolerance of the resistors) is as follows:
Say there is a 10K resistor (nominal value) of tolerance 10%, then the actual value can be anything between 9K and 11K (approximately).
So specifying another resistor value within this range is nonsense. The next available value is actually 12K (nominal), since its actual
value can spread from 11K to 13.5K (approx). The following nominal value is 15K (with actual stagger within 13.5K and 16.5K) and so on.
Hence the values available in this series are 10K, 12K, 15K, 18K, 22K, 27K, 33K, 39K, 47K, 56K, 68K, 82K and 100K (which starts the next
series).

Check:

68K (range (68K - 6K8) to (68K + 6K8) or between 61K to 75K)

82K (range (82K -8K2) to (82K + 8K2) or between 74K to 90K)
etc.

===Colour Codes===

The value and tolerance of a resistor is normally given by a sequence of coloured bands on the resistor body. Normally, there are four bands, three to give the value and one for the tolerance. Occasionally, a fifth and a sixth band may be added. When four bands are used, first two are digits, the third is a multiplier and the last is the tolerance. When five bands are used, first three are digits, the fourth is a multiplier and the fifth is the tolerance. The sixth band is included to give information about how the resistance changes according to temperature. These are generally found only in military equipment.

{{:Engineering_Tables/Electronic_colour_codes}}

Mnemonics exist for remembering the order of the colours. A common one is:
:'''B'''lack '''B'''ears '''R'''obbed '''O'''ur '''Y'''ummy '''G'''oodies, '''B'''eating '''V'''arious '''G'''ray '''W'''olves.  '''G'''et '''S'''ome '''N'''ow.

There is usually a small gap between each value band and a wider gap between the three (or four) value bands and the tolerance (and temp. coefficient) bands. These are read last in the code. No resistor colour code ever starts with gold or silver.

[[Image:4-Band_Resistor.svg|right|200px]]

The image on the right shows a resistor with a 4-Band colour code.

*The first band is red, so the value starts '''2'''.
*The second band is violets, so the next digit is '''7''', giving 27.
*The multiplier band is green, so the value is multiplied by '''10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;''', giving 2,700,000.
*The tolerance band is gold, so the tolerance is '''&amp;plusmn;5%'''.

The value of the resistor is therefore 2M7, with a tolerance of 5%.

For an online calculator for resistors with 4, 5, or 6 bands, see [http://samengstrom.com/nxl/3660/4_band_resistor_color_code_page.en.html].

===Power dissipation===
[[File:Carbon and ceramic resistors of different power ratings.jpg|thumb|Carbon and ceramic resistors of different power ratings alongside a scale. The scale smallest division is millimetres (mm) and the largest (numbered) is centimetres (cm).]]
Besides resistance, the resistors available in the market also vary according to the power they can dissipate. In general terms, the greater the power dissipation, the larger the resistor. Thus size can be taken as a rough measure of power dissipation. On the photography to the right there is a visual comparison of resistors rated at various power dissipations.

==Resistors in Series and Parallel==
Resistors can be connected in series to increase resistance or in parallel to decrease resistance

===Series===
[[Image:Resistors in Series.svg|right]]
When resistors are wired in [[w:Series_and_parallel_circuits#Series_circuits|series]], the total resistance is the sum of all the individual resistances. For an explanation of this, see [[Practical_Electronics/Resistors/Series_Proof|this proof]]. So for the resistor network to the right, the total resistance, R&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;, is:

::&lt;math&gt;R_{tot}=R_1+R_2+\ldots+R_n&lt;/math&gt;

If ''n'' identical resistors are in series, then the total resistance is ''n'' times the resistance of those identical resistors. This is useful when you want a simple multiple of the resistance.

When a resistance is added in series with others, the total resistance always increases. The total resistance will therefore be more than the greatest value of resistor present.

===Parallel===
[[Image:Resistors in Parallel.svg|right]]
When resistors are wired in [[w:Series_and_parallel_circuits#Parallel_circuits|parallel]], the [[w:reciprocal|reciprocal]] of the total resistance is the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances. For an explanation of this, see [[Practical_Electronics/Resistors/Parallel_Proof|this proof]]. So for the resistor network to the right, the total resistance, R&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;, is:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{R_{tot}}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\ldots+\frac{1}{R_n}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''n'' identical resistors are in parallel, then the total resistance is 1/''n'' the resistance of those identical resistors. This is useful when you want a simple fraction of the resistance.

When a resistance is added in parallel with others, the total resistance always decreases. The total resistance will therefore be less than the smallest value of resistor present.

===Series and Parallel===

[[Image:Resistors in Series and Parallel.svg|right|302px]]
Resistors can also be combined in a combination of series and parallel. To calculate the total resistance in these cases, simply break it into smaller parts that are basic series/parallel combinations and treat each one as one resistor. Consider the arrangement to the right. This is made up of two resistors in parallel, in series with another resistor.

The resistance of the two in parallel is:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{R_p}=\frac{1}{100}+\frac{1}{10}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;R_p=\frac{100}{11}&lt;/math&gt;

When combined in series with the other resistance,

::&lt;math&gt;R_{tot}=R_p+3.3\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;R_{tot}=\frac{100}{11}+3.3\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;R_{tot}=\frac{1363}{110}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;R_{tot}=12.4 \Omega\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Uses of Resistors==

As we saw in a previous chapter, the current flowing in a simple circuit depends only on the voltage and resistance. This means that given a fixed voltage, by changing the resistance, the current can be tuned. The same applies when the voltage is what we want to fix, and the current is constant (or cannot be changed). By altering the resistance, we can set the voltage.

Because they resist flow of charge, resistors are also used to limit the current flowing through sensitive components. For example, a component that has a low resistance but cannot tolerate too much current should be used in series with a resistor, which will limit the current. The exact value of the resistor depends on the specifications of the device being used. A common application like this is when an [[Practical_Electronics/LEDs|LED]] is used. LEDs generally need 2V at 20mA to work properly. Say we have a 9V circuit, we need to lose 7V to operate the LED. Putting this into Ohm's Law, we get:

::&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{V}{I}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{7}{20 \times 10^{-3}}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;R=350\,&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the resistor should be 350R to give the LED 2V at 20mA. However, this is not in the E12 series, so we find the next best, which is 390R. 330R is closer, but may exceed the LEDs current capacity, damaging it.

= Food =

Food, much much more often than not, is bought from a shop or restaurant. It may also be home-grown, a practice which has recently been on the increase, or hunted, gathered or scavenged for, but this happens much less often, and there are often legal restrictions on doing so. For example, it is illegal to kill a swan, and on specified land in Scotland and Wales, deer&lt;ref&gt;from http://www.basc.org.uk/content/stalkingpractice&lt;/ref&gt; deliberately, especially for the purposes of consumption, without the permission of the appropriate authority.

Food enjoyed by the British is extremely varied, due to the history of the regions and more recently multiculturalism, and includes the following dishes (recipes for which can be found at [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom]]):

=== Savoury ===
* Fish and Chips - battered fish deep fried accompanied by chips, often with a sauce such as gravy, mushy peas or curry sauce
* Pies - pastry casings containing meat and/or vegetables sometimes with gravy or jelly. Well loved varieties include :-
** Steak and Kidney pie
** Meat and potato pie
** Pork Pie
** Cornish Pasty
** Chicken and Mushroom pie
** Chicken and Bacon pie
* Sandwiches (with various fillings)
* Jacket Potatoes, also with various fillings
* Roast Meat (often Chicken, Lamb, Beef or Pork but others are also enjoyed) accompanied by roast, boiled or steamed vegetables and gravy
* Cottage Pie - a minced beef sauce covered with mashed potato often topped with cheese and then baked (Shepherd's pie if minced lamb/mutton is used, and fish pie when cooked with fish
* Bangers and mash
* Madras - a moderately hot sweet and sour dish
* Korma - a dish with a mildly spiced coconut sauce
* Dopiaza - a moderately hot onion-based dish

=== Desserts ===
* Crumble
* Fruit Pie
* Summer Pudding
* Roly-poly pudding

      <text xml:space="preserve">The 1st Assistant Director is responsible for managing the set during production of a motion picture.  They are the primary interface between Director and Crew. They ensure that the technical and logistical facets of production are handled smoothly so that the Director can focus on the artistic aspects.

The 1st AD is responsible for scheduling the shoot each day as well as managing the set during production. Good communication skills are key. Shot lists are crucial to the 1st AD performing his or her job efficiently. Without them, the shooting schedule may be created on the fly, and this disorganization will most likely show up on screen.

The Assistant Director's job of calling out &quot;lock it up, quiet, roll sound, roll camera&quot; in advance of each shot.

&quot;Lock it up&quot;: On-Set Term; A get ready signal shouted out by the AD, when shooting is about to begin. Because there must be quiet on the set, the phrase suggests that any open doors, cabinets or moving parts on any equipment must be closed, taped, locked or otherwise made immobile in order to ensure silence.

&quot;Picture's up!&quot;: On-Set Term; Warning shouted out by the AD that the sequence of cues to shoot a scene is about to begin. Also, a final warning to everyone on set to shut-up.

&quot;Roll Sound&quot;: On-Set Term; A call made by the director or 1st AD to cue the sound guy in anticipation of shooting a take. The command always precedes &quot;Action!&quot; so as to allow sufficient lead-time for the audiotape to begin in front of the rolling film.

Both are gross generalizations, and, one should try to avoid making gross generalizations about anything.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Location Scout: Player; Scouts out locations for the film to be shot. Most start by making a list and getting feedback from the director on the size, feel and dynamics of each location. The scout will then photograph the different possibilities and report back to the director who in turn chooses the ones he or she likes and goes to visit them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Production Assistant: Player; (PA) Adam Gelvan was one of the production assistants on the set of Project Greenight's first film, &quot;Stolen Summer.&quot; We think his definition of a PA is spot-on: &quot;Think of the ideal movie set as a well-oiled machine. While the large gears perform larger, 'more important' tasks, the smaller gears must perform theirs as well. If one small gear stops working, it will be disastrous for the rest of the machine. I would liken a PA to a small gear. We take care of all the things that allow the large gears (Director, AD, Producer, etc.) to function smoothly and properly.&quot; Very diplomatically stated, Adam.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Script Supervisor: Player; This person treats the script as the Bible, taking great care to ensure that what is written in the script is shot on film. Writer/directors like Project Greenight's first winner, Pete Jones, are usually good at doing this themselves but, often times, directors who are shooting someone else's script need a script supervisor to keep them in check.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt; [[Python Programming/Variables and Strings|Back to Problems]]

1. ''Write a program that asks the user to type in a string, and then tells the user how long that string was.''

We will save the string in question as &quot;&lt;code&gt;string1&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.  The &lt;code&gt;str()&lt;/code&gt; command converts the user input into a string.  Then we have the program print the length.  Note that the print statement doesn't require extra spaces - these are added automatically. 

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
string1 = str(raw_input(&quot;Type in a string: &quot;))
print (&quot;The string is&quot;, len(string1), &quot;characters long.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

2. ''Ask the user for a string, and then for a number. Print out that string, that many times. (For example, if the string is &lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt; and the number is &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; you should print out &lt;code&gt;hellohellohello&lt;/code&gt;.)''

Ask the user for some text and use the &lt;code&gt;str()&lt;/code&gt; command to turn it into a string (we will save it as &quot;&lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt;&quot;).  Then ask the user for a number and use the &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; command to turn it into an integer.  We'll save this as &quot;&lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.  

Lastly print &lt;code&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/code&gt; times &lt;code&gt;&quot;number&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.  

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
text = str(raw_input(&quot;Type in some text: &quot;))
number = int(raw_input(&quot;How many times should it be printed? &quot;))
print (text * number)
&lt;/source&gt;

3. ''What would happen if a mischievous user typed in a word when you ask for a number?  Try it.  ''

Let's try it!  You can use a simple program such as this one: 

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
number = int(raw_input(&quot;Type in a number: &quot;))
doubled = number * 2
print (doubled)
&lt;/source&gt;

When we run it with text we get an error: 

&lt;pre&gt;
Type in a number: I am not a number!  

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;C:/Documents and Settings/D Irwin/Desktop/test2.py&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    number = int(raw_input(&quot;Type in a number: &quot;))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'I am not a number!  '
&lt;/pre&gt;

The program calmly reminds us that &lt;code&gt;'I am not a number!  '&lt;/code&gt; is not a number!

The last six chapters were devoted to learn the ''velars'', ''palatals'', ''retroflexes'', ''dentals'' and ''labials''. In this chapter we will learn the letters of the seventh row (ਯ ਵਰਗ) of Gurmukhi consisting of the ''Semi vowels''. 

== Seventh row of Gurmukhi ==

The letters of the seventh row of Gurmukhi are 
{{Listen|filename=GurmukhiSemiVowels.ogg|title=Seventh row|description=Play for names of these letters|format=[[Ogg]]}}
:&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਯ ਰ ਲ ਵ ੜ&lt;/span&gt;
They are called ਯ - ''yaiia'', ਰ - ''raaraa'', ਲ - ''lallaa'', ਵ - ''vavaa'' and ੜ - ''rhaarhaa''. Their pronunciation is ਯ - /y/, ਰ - /r/, ਲ - /l/, ਵ - /v/ and ੜ - /rh/.&lt;br&gt;
Each of them is explained below.
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਯ&lt;/span&gt; Yaiiaa : This is how words ''yak'' and ''yes'' are written in Gurmukhi
::ਯਾ + ਕ = ਯਾਕ = yak 
::ਯੈੱ + ਸ = ਯੈੱਸ = yes
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਰ&lt;/span&gt; Raaraa : ਰ is equivalent to /r/. For illustration of the use of ਰ see these examples
::ਰੈ + ਟ = ਰੈਟ = rat 
::ਰੇ + ਡੀ + ਓ = ਰੇਡੀਓ = radio 
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਲ&lt;/span&gt; Lallaa : ਲ is equivalent to /l/. The words ''lava'' and ''jail'' are written in Gurmukhi as
::ਲਾ + ਵਾ = ਲਾਵਾ = lava
::ਜੇ + ਲ = ਜੇਲ = jail
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਵ&lt;/span&gt; Vavvaa : ਵ is equivalent to /v/. Notice the words ''vest'' and ''velar'' in Gurmukhi below.
::ਵੈ + ਸ + ਟ = ਵੈਸਟ = vest 
::ਵੈ + ਲ + ਰ = ਵੈਲਰ =velar 
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ੜ&lt;/span&gt; Rhaarhaa : Last letter ੜ of the original 'Penti' has no English equivalent. We will denote it with to /rh/. Have a look at a Punjabi example.
:: ਵਾ + ੜ = ਵਾੜ =  fence
:: ਮਾ + ੜਾ = ਮਾੜਾ = weak, bad

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt; [[Python Programming/Loops|Back to Problems]]

1. ''Create a program to count by prime numbers. Ask the user to input a number, then print each prime number up to that number.''

For this program we will make a list of possibilities up to the user's input, then test each one using [[W:Fermat's little theorem|Fermat's little theorem]], verifying that it is prime, then adding the prime to a list of primes.  Finally we print the list of primes.  

Comment: All primes fulfill [[W:Fermat's little theorem|Fermat's little theorem]], but some returned results are &quot;pseudoprimes&quot; which are not primes (e.g. 341=11*31, in python: (((2**341)-2)%341 == 0)).  More information about [http://primes.utm.edu/prove/prove2_2.html finding primes &amp; proving primality]

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
primes = []
                    # Creates a list that we will throw our prime numbers into.  
user = 1 + int(raw_input(&quot;What number would you like to count primes up to?  &quot;))
                    # 1 is added on to the user's number so that their number
                    # is counted.  
list = range(2,user)
                    # 0 and 1 are not prime, but our algorithm registers them
                    # as prime, so we start with two
for possibility in list:
    if ((2**possibility)-2)%possibility == 0:
                    # Our algorithm (Fermat's little theorem)  states
                    # that if &quot;i&quot; is an integer and i^p-i divides evenly
                    # into p, p is prime.  We are using 2 in place of i.
                    # See Python Programming/Basic Math for more info.  		
        isprime = True
        test = 2
        while test &lt; possibility and isprime:
                    # Here we verify that the number is in fact prime by
                    # starting at 2 and dividing it by every number lower 
                    # than the potential prime.  See comment above.
            if (possibility%test) == 0:
                    # This ends the while loop causing the next number
                    # to be tested.
                isprime = False
            test = test + 1
        if isprime:
                    # We add each prime to the primes list.  
            primes.append(possibility)
print (&quot;The prime numbers from 0 to&quot;, user-1, &quot;are: &quot;)
for possibility in primes:
    print possibility
                    # Print out all the primes!
&lt;/source&gt;

2.  Instruct the user to pick an arbitrary number from 1 to 100 and proceed to guess it correctly within seven tries. After each guess, the user must tell whether their number is higher than, lower than, or equal to your guess.

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
print &quot;\nIn your head, pick a number between 1 and 100, \ni'll guess it with some hints:\n&quot;
letsstart = raw_input(&quot;ready? input anything...\n&quot;)
uppers = 100
lowers = 0
guess = 50
boom = 0
for c in range(1,10):
	if boom == 0:
		print &quot;guess: &quot;,guess
		answer = raw_input(&quot;Was that\na. too low\nb. too high\nc.  thats right!\n&quot;)
		if answer == &quot;c&quot;:
			print &quot;I got it!  Thanks for playing.\n&quot;
			boom = 1
		elif answer == &quot;a&quot;:
			lowers = guess
			blah = int((uppers-guess)/2)
			guess = guess + blah
		elif answer == &quot;b&quot;:
			uppers = guess
			blash = int((guess-lowers)/2)
			guess = guess-blash
&lt;/source&gt;

== [[x86 Disassembly]] ==

I've seen some of your fixes to this book, thanks a lot! I don't always proofread my own work very well, so a lot of small typos tend to linger around till fresh eyes take a look at them. While you're reading through that book, let me know if there are any topics that need better coverage, and feel free to add any material that you have. Let me know if you have any questions about this book or about Wikibooks in general. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:11, 4 August 2008 (UTC)</text>

== what is a &quot;book&quot;  ==

Hi Mike, I saw your post on foundation-l about the the AllBooks extension, and .. as you can well imagine, this is a wikisource problem as well.  For Wikisource I have developed a mean and nasty script to work this out, or at least provide everyone with a list of pages to be fixed up.  see [[s:User:Jayvdb/Toolserver]] and [[s:Wikisource:Scriptorium#Statistics]] and [[s:User talk:GrafZahl#statistics]].  My thoughts on this is that naming conventions are the simplest way to define works.

I've copied the scripts to run on the wikibooks database: [http://toolserver.org/~john/wikibooks-works.php works] and [http://toolserver.org/~john/wikibooks-subpages.php just the subpages].  I suspect that the logic will need to be tweaked to work for Wikibooks; let me know if you see any major shortcomings in the algorithm.  Once the major kinks are removed, we can take it to the WB VP for more eyes. [[User:Jayvdb|John Vandenberg]] ([[User talk:Jayvdb|talk]]) 05:21, 5 July 2008 (UTC)
:It is splitting apart some books into multiple parts, but I'm not sure why that would be. In any case, it's pretty good - thanks for that. I'd recommend grabbing [[User:Darklama]] and/or [[User:Ramac]] to figure out the technical details though. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:13, 5 July 2008 (UTC)

== IP blocking - notice regarding Virgin Media IP addresses ==

Hi Mike. Please be careful when blocking Virgin Media IPs (as you did with 82.46.8.90 and 82.42.237.84) and make sure the block summary is easy to understand: these IPs &lt;b&gt;are&lt;/b&gt; shared IPs, and they get recycled by people across the country.

Note that 82.* Virgin Media IPs cover most of the North of England, up to Yorkshire at least, 195.* covers most of the Midlands, and there's some others I'm not sure about.
I do know that there was persistent abuse of 195.188.152.16 on Wikipedia (which is now an indef-blocked IP, unusual considering it's not marked as a zombie or open proxy there).

A block length of about a year should be sufficient, not 2 years (as you set with one IP). Be aware though, that some IPs that are Virgin Media ones can be zombie computers and insecure wireless networks that anyone can access, plus public computers. (if you want to let the people on the mailing list called &quot;checkuser-l&quot; know this, feel free to).

Public computers sometimes do have Virgin Media IP addresses - e.g. 195.188.50.200 is for Sefton Libraries, in Merseyside, North West England.

I hope this has helped you, and feel free to let the other checkusers know. In any case, I was a checkuser at a non-Wikimedia wiki that's now gone (mainly due to the fact that no-one apart from me, the site owner and 3 - 4 dedicated contributors were ever editing it) so that's how I know my stuff. if you want to know any more leave a note at my talk page. Hope I helped ya. --[[User:Wilsow66|Wilsow66]] ([[User talk:Wilsow66|talk]]) 22:43, 6 July 2008 (UTC)

==Userboxes==
If you don't mind me asking, how did you get all of those userboxes orginized like that? [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 17:33, 7 July 2008 (UTC)
:Which ones, organized how? :) First of all, they're transcluded from subpages [[User:Mike.lifeguard/Userboxes]] and [[User:Mike.lifeguard/UserboxesTop]] so they don't clutter my actual userpage. And then the big set is inside a {{tlx|dynamic navigation}}. The actual code for them is copied (then modified) from [[w:User:Mike.lifeguard/Userboxes]], where I had simply substituted the userboxes. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:29, 7 July 2008 (UTC)
::Alright, I have no idea how to do that. But, one more question. Did you makea template of your userboxes? Looking at your wikipedia page, I noticed all you have is &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:User:Mike.lifeguard/Userboxes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. I would like to do something like that, so I could better orginize my userpage as I add userboxes over time.

== Logos and copyright ==

Hallo - its me again on the subject of images and copyright (I will soon be able to write a book on it!).  The book I have been writing was going to have a copy of the software logo on the front page but obviously the logo is not free for all to use.  While looking for something else I thought I saw a copyright tag that would protect it, but now I can't find it so maybe I just imagined it.  Any suggestions would be as welcome as ever! [[User:Hskeet|Hskeet]] ([[User talk:Hskeet|talk]]) 12:26, 8 July 2008 (UTC)
:You're looking for {{tlx|logo}} and {{tlx|fair use rationale}}, I think.

== First sentences ==

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]], I will be manually editing &quot;'''''Severus Snape''''' is the Potions teacher...,&quot; to &quot;'''Severus Snape''' is the Potions teacher...&quot;, etc. on most pages (i.e. The first use of an article's title in that article will become plain bold instead of bold-italic).

== Indef Block ==

== Re:Vandal ==

Thanks. I would have (asked for rollback) but I'll be leaving for college in a fortnight, which has a potential to disrupt my routine, and I can't guarantee if I'll be able to spare the time. When (and if) I get settled in college, I'll think about this. 

Also, I seem to be unable to get to the IRC channels. Do you know why this may be happening?

Mike,

Tonight I added three icons derived from others.  Wasn't exactly clear how to attribute them. On one the words I put in the summary box appeared in the file history but on the others it's hanging under the licensing. I'd be extremely grateful if you could point me in the right direction.

== Linux Networking How-to ==

Hello Mike,
I saw your Copyright violation message in Wiki'fying of Linux Networking How-to. In the link you mentioned, It pointed to older maintainer.
The current link is http://tldp.org/HOWTO/NET3-4-HOWTO.html 
This book is unmaintained and I had volunteered for the maintainership, but I wanted to keep a reference of the book to be constantly edited and maintained, thats the reason for me chosing wikibooks (instead of someother wiki site).
And that material is also Copyrighted under GPL, so I free to copy/edit in Wikibooks. Don't you agree? 
Let me know if I need to be aware of anything.

Thanks,
Senthil

:Sorry to intrude but since Mike is away and this seem somewhat urgent, I'll try to answer your core question.
:I've no previous knowledge of the problem, except the above post (I did some patrolling on the pages). GPL and GFDL + Exceptions (Wikibooks license) aren't compatible, the most problematic point is that each license requires that any modification uses the same license (or newer), so if you are not the author you can't relicense it (there are more incompatibilities). In any case the intention of the licenses are mostly the same, so if you can get in contact to the rights owner you may request to use the work under the GFDL + Exceptions. If you do contact the authors (Terry Dawson, Alessandro Rubini, POET) you can also take the time to explain that GPL is for software/code and GFDL is for documentation, both from the FSF (Free Software Foundation), we could even argue that the use of the GPL for texts is an error, if you check the copyright section of the page you linked above you can clearly read that &quot;This program is free software...&quot; since we can argue that there is no program the license isn't applicable.
:If no permission is given by all the authors the work will falls under a copyright violation and should be deleted.
:You can nevertheless write a similar work, there are ways to bypass the problem, simply by altering the structure, wording etc... , don't know if there is a guide on how to do it on texts but the FSF had a guide on how to avoid copyright violation when reimplementing (freeing) software. Well, hope this helps if I said something wrong Mike will correct me as soon as he is back...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:47, 22 July 2008 (UTC)

Since you initiated the VFD, did you at the time shared the view that DL was objecting to the decission (not the proceedings, he does indeed rant on how it was reached but historical it was always done in that way, so the argument is moot), if so I don't understand why you thought the VFD was a good idea, and promoted it as a reasonable solution and how ending it will help the situation (the only positive outcome is calming things up)...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:59, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

::What is your base to claim that the requirements for a speedy were not met? Do you read DL reply as an objection to the decission ? To me &quot;I don't care&quot; suffices as a statement of no interest for the outcome, an expression of non objection, the user was free to participate and even go to the place were the discussion was completed and clarify his position. (there was a proper time and place to do it properly) But again if you shared that view what was the point for the VFD? You could have stated it next to WK post or ask DL to be more clear.

::If your concern is the expressed opinion of Jammes then I share your view, but the discussion was completed, even so his newly expressed objection didn't address the issue at hand (did not provide a reason for keeping the page, nor a commitment to improve it), Jammes merely states that he doesn't like how the issue was resolved, but he was always free to act, sadly he only did it after WK refused to act.

::::As for consensual decission [[User:Panic2k4/Decision making and Community consensus on Wikibooks|I understand the concept very well]]. I have all intentions to promote even a more deeply use that the one has been used on Wikibooks (since the last revision), dropping completely majority rule voting (or consensus by majority if we take in consideration the argumentation provided) that is no decission would be passed until a a valid block exists, so I have a tendency more inclusive than the actual practice.
::::On the item at hand that is not the problem, and I'm open to address any objection, the issue is that up till now the reason not to execute the action was not substantiated by the claimed opposer and new objections haven't dealt with the issue under discussion, more the only way we have to evolve on a consensual decission process is to establish rules for the discussion that is establishing guidelines to the procedure and limitations may it be credentials, actions or timelines to validate any reached decission. In this case the discussion was transparent, in good intention and inclusive since the proceeding would be valid by common practice even if hadn't contacted DL.
::::My divergences with DL and WK are more complex and that is why I thread a thin line each time I have to interact with the users, one quick example was the &quot;correction&quot; DL made to my post here about GFDL+Extensions (correction that was wrong, I dropped the issue so to avoid conflict as it wasn't very relevant to the other user).
::::The thing is that WB doesn't use the standard GFDL it includes some exceptions 1) the stated exclusion of Invariant Sections (if this was the only difference then the exception word could probably be argued as an overstatement since the license clearly covers this standard option out, but requires it to be expressed) but 2) no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. could be but aren't defined as invariant sections, that is why the copyright notice clarifies it, those are indeed exceptions (anything excluded from or not conforming to a general rule or classification), the understanding of this fact (that some strongly object to) makes it clear that not all GFDL documents can be merged (historically we only raise problems when the original work has any of those excluded parts) but when you accept the use of works that originally don't have those stated exclusions we create the problem or relicensing the work beyond what the copyright holder (not necessarily the author) intended. That could cause future problems at least I claim so. I don't have any intention of calling wolf but I do state my objections when this information is not transmitted to people that are asking and porting works into the project (the simple request that they also agree to the exceptions would suffice). This is one examples of things put me on the bad side of some Wikibookians.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:01, 31 July 2008 (UTC)

== voting to keep a book ==

[[Optimal Classification]] was originally published in the Wikipedia in May of 2007. It contained an unwikified primary reference that was wikified as an inline reference, along with several notes. It had two minor typo's, which were corrected and wiki graphic tables which made it larger than necessary. The graphics were converted to images and the size reduce. Currently references and notes are being expanded and text added to clarify the theoretical and empirical separatory equations. It is a work in progress.

It was moved from the Wikipedia to the Wikibooks because Wikipedia user Jiuguang Wang read a Wikia article by the original author of the Wikipedia article which he rejected due to his being raised in Chinese Communist Beijing as an atheist prior to moving to Atlanta in 2000 when he was 12. The Wikia article uses logic to both define and support the existence of God.

In line with his rejection of the Wikia article he rejected the [[Optimal Classification]] article as a hoax and nominated it for deletion on the Wikipedia. Proof that the article is not original research can be found by reading the primary reference while the notability of the subject can be verified by reading the references the primary reference lists. 

I am contacting you because user Jiuguang Wang along with a Wikipedia administrator have now nominated the [[Optimal Classification]] ''book'' for deletion as a continuation of their harassment and personal attack against the Wikipedia author and since I have never been through a nomination for deletion experience I do not know how to post a vote to keep this book from being deleted.

I couldn't find the place to request SUL-related usurpations here, so ''hopefully'' they'll fail to draw and quarter me to ask you for some help. Rebecca (the ombudsman) doesn't have a unified account yet, and Cary asked for some help on that special global groups page on meta.

Hence my asking you if you'd be willing to either do her rename or properly file on her behalf. :D

Any assistance would be appreciated. Let me know if you have any questions! [[User:Kylu|Kylu]] ([[User talk:Kylu|talk]]) 03:10, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

==1. Use the following safety gear and know why it should be worn when skateboarding: helmet, elbow pads, knee pads, high top boots, wrist support gloves. ==

;Helmet: To protect head in case of fall
;Elbow Pads: To protect elbows in case of fall
;Knee Pads: To protect knees in case of fall
;High Top Boots: To support ankles when skating
;Wrist Support Gloves: To protect Wrists in case of fall

==2. Name all the parts of a skateboard. ==
Descriptions of the following skateboard parts are the ones most prevalent in popular, modern forms of skateboarding. Many niche disciplines exist with exotic or alternative constructions and designs that fall outside of much of the descriptions listed.

Skateboards are composed of the following parts:

===Decks===
[[Image:Skateboard.JPG|thumb|The underside of a skateboard. In this photo the deck, trucks and wheels can be seen.]]
Most decks are constructed with a seven-ply cross-laminated layup of Canadian maple. Sometimes other, more exotic materials, such as fiberglass, bamboo, resin, Kevlar, carbon fiber, aluminum, or plastic are incorporated into deck construction, usually to lighten the board or increase its strength or rigidity. Modern decks are usually 7 to 10.5&amp;nbsp;inches wide although they can vary. The width of a deck depends on personal preference though most people use 7.5-8&amp;nbsp;inch wide decks for street skating. Generally, riders use a wider deck for vert, to provide more stability. Skateboard decks are usually between 28 and 33&amp;nbsp;inches long. The underside of the deck is usually printed with a design by the manufacturer.   
    
The longboard, a common variant of the skateboard, has a longer deck. &quot;Old school&quot; boards (those made in the 1970s-80s or modern boards that mimic their shape) are generally wider and often have only one kicktail. 1970s variants often have little or no concavity, whereas 1980s models have deeper concavities and steeper kicktails.   
    
Grip tape is used to give a skater's feet more grip on the deck. It usually has an adhesive back and a sandpaper like top.

===Trucks===
[[Image:Skateboard-truck.jpg|thumb|A skateboard truck]]
Attached to the deck are two metal (usually aluminum alloy) trucks, which connect to the wheels and deck. The trucks are further composed of two parts. The top part of the truck is screwed to the deck and is called the baseplate, and beneath it is the hanger.  The axle runs through the hanger. Between the baseplate and the hanger are ''bushings'', also ''rubbers'' or ''grommets'', that provide the cushion mechanism for turning the skateboard. The ''bushings'' cushion the truck when it turns. The stiffer the bushings, the more resistant the skateboard is to turning. The softer the bushings, the easier it is to turn. A bolt called a ''kingpin'' holds these parts together and fits inside the bushings. Thus by tightening or loosening the kingpin nut, the trucks can be adjusted loosely for better turning and tighter for more control.

===Wheels===
The wheels of a skateboard, usually made of polyurethane, come in many different sizes and shapes to suit different types of skating. Larger sizes like 65-90&amp;nbsp;mm roll faster, and also move more easily over cracks in pavement. Smaller sizes like 48-54&amp;nbsp;mm keep the board closer to the ground, require less force to accelerate and produce a lower center of gravity, but also make for a slower top speed. Wheels also are available in a variety of hardnesses usually measured on the durometer 'A' scale. Wheels range from the very soft (about 75a) to the very hard (about 101a). As the scale stops at 100a, any wheels labelled 101a or higher are harder, but do not use the appropriate durometer scale. Some wheel manufacturers now use the 'B' or 'D' scale, which has a larger and more accurate range of hardnesses.

Modern street skaters prefer smaller wheels (usually 48-53 mm), as small wheels make tricks like kickflips and ollies easier. Street wheels also need to be quite hard, as small soft wheels absorb too much energy. Vert skating requires larger wheels (usually 55-65 mm) as vert skating involves high speeds that smaller wheels are unable to sustain. Vert wheels are usually very hard, so they can roll faster. As they are only used on ramps and parks that are smooth they are usually on the harder end of the durometer scale. Slalom skating requires even larger wheels (60-75 mm) to sustain the highest speeds possible. They also need to be soft and have better grip to make the tight and frequent turns in slalom racing. Even larger wheels are used in longboarding and downhill skateboarding. Sizes range from 65 mm right up to 100 mm. These extreme sizes of wheels almost always have cores of hard plastic that can be made thinner and lighter than a solid polyurethane wheel. They are often used by skateboard filmers or videographers, as the large soft wheels allow for smooth and easy movement over any terrain.

===Bearings===
Each skateboard wheel is mounted on its axle via two  ball bearings.  With few exceptions, the bearings are the industrial standard &quot;608&quot; size, with a bore of 8 mm, an outer diameter of 22 mm, and a width of 7 mm. These are usually made of steel, though silicon nitride, a high-tech ceramic, is sometimes used.  Many skateboard bearings are graded according to the ABEC scale. The scale starts  with ABEC1 as the lowest, 3, 5, 7, 9. It is a common misconception that higher numbers are better for skateboarding, as the ABEC rating only measures tolerances which do not necessarily apply to skateboards. The ABEC rating does not determine how fast or how durable a bearing used for skateboarding will be.  In particular, the ABEC rating says nothing about how well a bearing handles axial (side-to-side) loads, which are severe in most skateboard applications. Many companies do not show the ABEC rating, such as Bones Bearings, who are known for their high quality bearings.

===Hardware===
Mounting hardware is a set of eight 10-32 bolts, usually an allen or cross head, and matching self-lock nylock nuts. They are used to attach the trucks to the board. Some have a different colored bolt to show which side is the nose of the skateboard.
===Optional components===
====Rails====
Narrow strips of plastic that are fastened under the deck lengthwise along the edges. They are used for additional grip for grabs, and to enhance sliding while protecting the deck's graphics at the same time. These are seldom used in modern skateboarding.

====Slip Tape====
Slip tape is a clear piece of self adhesive plastic that sticks to the underside of a deck. It helps protect the board's graphics and can allow the board to slide better. These are becoming more popular in modern skateboarding.

====Lapper====
A lapper is a plastic cover that is fastened to the rear truck and serves to protect the kingpin when grinding. It also prevents hang-ups by providing a smoother transition for the truck when it hits an obstacle or a metal pipe or bar used to grind.These are non-existent in modern skateboarding.

====Nose guard====
A plastic bumper used to protect the tip of a skateboard. These are rare in modern skateboarding.

====Tail guard====
A tail guard is a plastic skid plate used to prevent wearing of the tail; they can also be used as a means to stop the board. The tail guard is not commonly used in skateboards today.

====Risers====
Riser or riser pads are made of plastic or rubber and go between the truck and the board to provide additional clearance for the wheels to prevent wheel-bite (when the truck turns to a degree where the wheel will contact with the deck and stop spinning). They usually range in height from 3mm to 12mm. Shock pads are a variation of risers that are usually made of rubber or neoprene. They absorb impact and reduce vibration, which in turn helps prevent hardware from loosening and they can also prevent pressure cracks from forming. Although they help to reduce the impact of the drop they also reduce the pop (Snapping on the tail of your skateboard to make it jump up.).

====Angled risers====
Angled riser, or 'wedges' are risers that alter the turning geometry of the truck they are bolted to. Thin side out results in more turn per board lean, thick side out results in less.

==3. Completely disassemble and reassemble a skateboard, repacking the bearings and setting wheelnuts and truck pivoting nut at correct tension. ==
==4. Demonstrate eight skateboarding skills which will include some of the following and do them to the instructors satisfaction on authorized property. Five of these should be demonstrated on a skateboarding ramp. ==

===Tick Tack—from a standing start to a minimum of 10 meters on level ground ===
===Ollie—minimum of 10 centimeters ===
===Rail Slide—minimum of 1 meter ===
===Drop In—off a ramp 2-3 meters high ===
===Gurreo Slide ===

      <comment>/* The Login Form */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Many beginning PHP programmers set out to build a website that features a '''user login system''' but are unaware of the awaiting pitfalls.  Below is a step-by-step guide through the necessary components of both a '''user authentication''' system and a '''user authorization''' system. The former is about determining whether users ''are who they say they are'', while the latter is concerned with whether or not users ''are allowed to do what they are trying to do'' (e.g. gain access to a particular page, or execute a particular query).

{{info|It is recommended that readers integrate the ''concepts'' outlined below into their scripts, and not simply cut and paste the code examples.}}

==Authentication==
There are two parts to the authentication process:
# The '''login form'''.  The user is presented with some way of entering their credentials; the system checks these against a list of known users; if a match is found, the user is authenticated.  This part of the system generally also initiates some way of remembering that a user is authenticated (such as by setting a cookie) so that this process doesn't have to be repeated for each request.
# The '''per-request check''' (for want of a better name!).  This is the same as the second part of the login form process, with the user credentials being acquired from a source more convenient to the user&amp;mdash;such as the cookie.

The code given below may need adjustment depending on the architecture of your scripts, whether object-oriented or procedural, having a single entry-point into your code or a dozen scripts each called separately. However the components of a login system are executed, their fundamentals are the same.  Similarly, when a 'database' is referred to, it does not necessarily mean MySQL or any other RDBMS; user information could be stored in flat files, on an LDAP server, or in some other way. 

=== The Login Form ===
This is the simplest part of the system, and the easiest place to start.  Put simply: an HTML form is presented to the user, the user enters his credentials, the form contents are submitted to the next part of the login system for processing.

The user's credentials are generally a username and password, although others are possible (such as a nonce from a hardware token-generator).  Many sites are now using the user's email address rather than a username. The advantages of this are that the e-mail addresses will be unique to one user, and it allows people to have consistent usernames since users with common usernames may not be able to get the same username everywhere they register.

{{Code:Basic
|The HTML for a basic login form could be something like this:
|&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;form action=&quot;/login&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;email&quot;&gt;Email address:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id=&quot;email&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;email&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;password&quot;&gt;Password:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id=&quot;password&quot; type=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;password&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

===Per-request Check===
The users authenticity must be verified upon each HTTP request (i.e. for a page, image, or whatever).  This is ostensibly as simple as seeing whether the relevant session variable is set:

{{Code:Basic
|The basic authentication check that needs to be run for each user request.
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
session_start();
if (!isset($_SESSION['email_address']))
{
    // User is not logged in, so send user away.
    header(&quot;Location:/login&quot;);
    die();
}
// User is logged in; private code goes here.
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

This is sufficient in many ways, but it is vulnerable to a number of attacks.  It relies utterly upon the session being tied to the right user. This is not a good thing, because sessions can be ''hijacked'' (the session key can be stolen by a third party) or ''fixed'' (a third party can force a user to use a session key that the third party knows).  Read the [[{{BOOKNAME}}/sessions|sessions]] page of this Wikibook for more information about this and how to avoid it.

{{Code:Basic
|The basic authentication check, with additional guards against session hijacking or fixation.
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$timeout = 60 * 30; // In seconds, i.e. 30 minutes.
$fingerprint = md5($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'].$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']);
session_start();
if (    (isset($_SESSION['last_active']) &amp;&amp; $_SESSION['last_active']&lt;(time()-$timeout))
     || (isset($_SESSION['fingerprint']) &amp;&amp; $_SESSION['fingerprint']!=$fingerprint)
     || isset($_GET['logout'])
    )
{
    setcookie(session_name(), '', time()-3600, '/');
    session_destroy();
}
session_regenerate_id(); 
$_SESSION['last_active'] = time();
$_SESSION['fingerprint'] = $fingerprint;
// User authenticated at this point (i.e. $_SESSION['email_address'] can be trusted).
&lt;/source&gt;
|
}}

The &lt;code&gt;$_SESSION['last_active']&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$_SESSION['fingerprint']&lt;/code&gt; variables will also need to be set at the initial log in point (where the login form was processed) if they are to be used; simply insert the following lines above where the &lt;code&gt;email_address&lt;/code&gt; variable is set:

{{Code:Basic
|The code used to check if the user is the same user that logged in.
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$fingerprint             = md5($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'].$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']);
$_SESSION['last_active'] = time();
$_SESSION['fingerprint'] = $fingerprint;
&lt;/source&gt;
|
}}

One thing to remember when using browser fingerprints, however, is that, while they do add some security to your application, they are not a catchall by any means. Many [[ISP]]s offer Dynamic IP addresses, which are IP address that change at certain intervals. If this were to happen while a user is browsing your page, he would be kicked out of his account. Also, the code snippet that checks to make sure the browser is the same, can be modified via Firefox extensions which modify the headers while requesting the page.

And that is how a secure user-authentication system is implemented in PHP5!  There are a number of points that have been glossed over in the information above, and some that have been left out completely (e.g. how to only start a session when necessary).  If you are implementing your own user login system and are trying to follow the advice given here, there are sure to be things that you will figure out as you go and will wish were explained here, so please be bold and edit this page to add anything that you feel is missing.

* User-, group-, role-based authorization.

      <text xml:space="preserve">could use more explaining to do with the roasting, are they dry roasted?, what temperature should they be at?

Why does the recipe calls twice for cumin seeds? It seems that there is a mix up.

It appears as though the double reference for cumin seeds came from this revision[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook:Garam_masala&amp;oldid=1001305].I am not an expert on this type of cooking so I don't know which one is correct.--[[User:GordonChil|GordonChil]] ([[User talk:GordonChil|talk]]) 20:03, 23 March 2009 (UTC)

I think that 20g of cumin is more likely to be correct than 90g --[[User:Chrisfl|Chrisfl]] ([[User talk:Chrisfl|talk]]) 22:26, 23 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Consoles and GUI ==
[[Image:Delphi okruženje.gif|thumb|right|160px|A dialog coded in Delphi. It's a GUI.]]
At first we want to begin with a console application, but what's the difference between consoles and GUIs? GUI is the short form of Graphical User Interface which means that the user has one or more windows with so called components &amp;mdash; e. g. edit fields, buttons, check boxes, scroll bars, a toolbar, a menu, ... &amp;mdash; where he can edit something or do something with them to call an event, linked with a procedure (in other programming languages called functions &amp;mdash; but there's a difference between functions and procedures in Delphi). The procedure is a sub algorithm with some commands (also called statements) that are only executed by calling that event.

[[Image:Pascal-console-howoldru1.png|thumb|left|324px|The program ''howoldru'' coded in Pascal. It runs in console.]]
In Windows, a console is also a little window, but it isn't called 'window' officially! By default the background of this 'window' is black and the font color is white. But you also can change those colors. You can put out or in a text there, but you can't set real components on it. The only thing you can do is simulating this. There are normally no events; your code will be executed off the reel. If you write nothing, the application will be terminated. If you write nothing in a GUI application, nothing will happen &amp;mdash; the application won't be terminated!

Most today's applications are GUI application, for example Word, Excel or even Delphi itself. If you want to see a console application, all you have to do is pressing the start button, click Run and enter &quot;cmd&quot;. Press 'Return' and the command prompt will open soon.

How can we create a GUI application? There are two ways. The first way &amp;mdash; which is not very comfortable &amp;mdash; is taking a console application and creating components and windows by using complicated commands defined by the Windows ''API'' (Application Public Interface), a library of many functions and procedures about multimedia, graphics and windows.

The second way which is more comfortable is using a special ''Integrated Development Environment'' (IDE) where we can design the components at design time (when we develop the application) and the IDE (Delphi) generates the code which creates those windows and components. Normally we &amp;mdash; as a Delphi programmer &amp;mdash; use this way!

== The first application: a console ==
Start the IDE; Enter &quot;file&quot; / &quot;new&quot; and choose &quot;console&quot;. You will see the following:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 program Project1;
 
 {$APPTYPE CONSOLE}
 
 uses
   SysUtils;
 
 begin
   { TODO -oUser -cConsole Main : Enter your code here }
 end.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
You can delete line 9. Between &lt;code&gt;'''begin'''&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'''end.'''&lt;/code&gt; you can type your code. More about that you will find in the chapter [[Delphi Programming/Statements|Statements]]. The first line means that the project is registered and saved under 'Project1', so the unit is saved under 'Project1.pas' (pas = Pascal). '&lt;code&gt;{$APPTYPE CONSOLE}&lt;/code&gt;' means that it is a console application. We use the library 'SysUtils' → we have to enter it in the &lt;code&gt;uses&lt;/code&gt; clause. Later, when you have written some code, press F9 to compile and run. You will see your program under 'Project1.exe'. This is the file you have to copy to give your application to other people.

In an effort to combat one of the most common criticisms of Wiki-based resources (that &quot;the encyclopedia anyone can edit&quot; can in fact be edited by ''anyone'' - namely those who have absolutely no knowledge of the subject)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/the-big-question-do-we-need-a-more-reliable-online-encyclopedia-than-wikipedia-420497.html &quot;Using it [Wikipedia&amp;#93; is like asking questions of a bloke you met in the pub. He might be a nuclear physicist. Or he might be a fruitcake.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;, I have compiled a brief &quot;résumé&quot; of &quot;credentials.&quot;

I have taken eleven Advanced Placement exams offered by the College Board. Exams are scored on a 1 to 5 scale, with a score of 3 being a passing grade. Grades of 5 are considered &quot;extremely well qualified,&quot; 4 considered &quot;well qualified,&quot; and 3 considered &quot;qualified.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/student/testing/ap/AP-bulletin_2007-08.pdf AP Bulletin 2007-08]&lt;/ref&gt;

Please note that as a logical extension of these listed credentials, I am not to be trusted regarding any perceived knowledge I may think I have on subjects including (but not limited to) biology, chemistry, computer science, physics, psychology, or any field of knowledge considered to be in any way related to any type of hard science.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">First, let's define a ''type''.

In Delphi, like in [[C Programming|C]], [[Visual Basic|VB]] and unlike [[PHP Programming|PHP]], [[Python Programming|Python]] or other modern languages, a variable is ''typed'' and can only contain values of this type. To make it simple, a type is a variable attribute.

== Basic types ==

Delphi is extremely complete for this. There are lots of predefined types and you can also create your own types (we will see it later). Here is a table with the most useful basic types (also called ''primitive types''):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Type
! Description
! Size
! Value
|-
| boolean
| boolean
| 1 bit
| True/False
|-
| char
| character
| 1 byte
| One item of the ASCII table (or ANSI)
|-
| string
| string of characters
| Depends on its number of characters
| Dynamic table of items of the ASCII table (or ANSI)
|-
| integer
| positive or negative integer
| 4 bytes
| -2147483648 '''to''' 2147483647
|-
| cardinal
| unsigned integer
| 4 bytes
| 0 '''to''' 4294967295
|-
| real (equivalent to double)
| real number
| 8 bytes
| 5.0 x 10^-324 '''to''' 1.7 x 10^308
|}
:'''Remarks:''' Above are only the most popular predefined types. There are dozens of other types just for the integers (smallint, longint, int64...) whose usage fits very specific needs (like the size of the data we will put in) and so optimizes the memory usage. For more information about it, see the documentation in the Delphi help content.

== char ==
A char (a character) is something like '#', 'A', '2', ';', '.', '?' and so on. It has a number in a library of chars, the ASCII. In Delphi, a char is typed between two single quotes. If the given character is the single quote itself, you should double the character, in other words, you have to type four single quotes.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
var
  a, b: char;

begin
  a := 'H';  // a = &quot;H&quot;
  b := 'i';  // b = &quot;i&quot;
  WriteLn(a);  // Display &quot;H&quot;
  WriteLn(a, b);  // Display &quot;Hi&quot;
  WriteLn(a, b, '!');  // Display &quot;Hi!&quot;
end.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== string ==
You have already worked with strings in the last chapter, such as 'Hello World' or 'Hi there' and so one. A string is a sequence of chars.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
 var
   text1: string;
   character1: char;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
And then write between begin and end:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 character1 := 'H';
 text1 := 'ello World!';
 WriteLn(character1, text1);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
If you want to write a single quote in a string, the best way is to type two successive single quotes:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 text1 := 'I''m John Doe.';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Strings behave like the tables. You can access to a character using an index:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
 text := 'Hello World!';
 WriteLn(text[1]); // Only print &quot;H&quot;.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The first index is 1 (and not 0).

=== Textual expressions ===
Strings can be linked using the + operator:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3-4&quot;&gt;
 firstWord := 'Hello';
 secondWord := 'World';
 WriteLn(firstWord + ' ' + secondWord + '!');
 wholeText := firstWord + ' ' + secondWord + '!';
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The + operator can be used with variables with different types. According to the types, the result will have a different type:
* string + string → string
* string + char → string
* char + char → string
* char + string → string
* string + number → error
* number + string → error
* number + number → number
* number + char → error
* char + number → error

== Integers ==

Integers are even integers, you write:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 a: Integer;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Floats ==

Floats are decimal numbers. They use a [[w:Floating point|floating point]]. You can write:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 c: Real;   // Real is normally the same like Single
 a: Single;
 b: Double;
 d: Extended;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
An Extended is more precise than a Real, but needs more main storage.

== Boolean ==

Boolean is a logical value. It can be 'True' or 'False'. Write:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
 var
   a: Boolean;
 begin
   a := True;
   // or
   a := False;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
But there is only a sense of Boolean when you know the conditional structures in the next chapter.

== Arrays ==

An array is a collection of strings, floats, integers or any data type. It can also contain an array. In this case, we have an array with several dimensions. You say:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 a: array [from..to] of data_type;
 → a: array [1..3] of string;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
for one dimension. For two:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 a: array [fX..tX] of
    array [fY..tY] of data_type;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
and so on. A single element of an array is for example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 a[1] := 'Hello '
 a[2] := 'World'
 a[3] := '!';
WriteLn(a[1],
         a[2],
         a[3]);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Record ==
A record (also called a ''structure'' in other languages) represents a set of heterogeneous data. Each item is a field. The record type declaration specifies the name and the type of each field. By convention, the name of a record type starts with a &quot;T&quot;. A record type declaration has the following syntax:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
type recordTypeName= record
listField1: type1;
 ...
listFieldn: typen;
end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

For example, the following declaration creates a record type called ''TDateRec''.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
type
  TDateRec = record
    Year: Integer;
    Month: (Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun,
            Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec);
    Day: 1..31;
  end;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Each TDateRec contains three fields: an integer value called ''Year'', an enumerate value called ''Month'' and another integer value between 1 and 31 called ''Day''. The identifiers Year, Month and Day are names of fields of TDateRec that behave as variables. However, the TDateRec type declaration doesn't allocate memory for the Year, Month and Day fields. The memory is allocated when you instantiate a record, which you do as follows:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
var Record1, Record2: TDateRec;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The variable declaration creates two instances of TDateRec, called Record1 and Record2.

You can access to a record field by qualify the name of the field with the name of the record:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Record1.Year := 1922;
Record1.Month := Nov;
Record1.Day := 26;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Or by using the &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; instruction:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
with Record1 do
begin
  Year := 1922;
  Month := Nov;
  Day := 26;
end;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Examples ==
The following example asks a question, retrieves the answer and prints the answer:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 var
 _Input, _Linkage: string;
 begin
   WriteLn('Hello, what is your name?');
   ReadLn(_Input);
   _Linkage := 'Hello, ' + _Input;
   WriteLn(_Linkage);
 end.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ReadLn(_Input)&lt;/code&gt; means that the application waits for the user to enter a text and then saves the text in the variable &lt;code&gt;_Input&lt;/code&gt;.

This other example gets the number of a char in the ASCII:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 var
   number: Integer; // Declare number as an integer
   _Input: string;
   _Char1: char;
 begin
   WriteLn('Enter a char!');
   ReadLn(_Input);
   _Char1 := _Input[1];
   number := Ord(_Char1);
   WriteLn('ASCII is: ', number);
 end.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
With _Input[1] you get the first char of _Input. And the first char is char 1, (not char 0 like in [[C++ Programming|C++]]!)

Welcome to the Wikibooks guide to '''Bonsai''', the art of miniature trees in pots.  Creating bonsai involves artistic skills, akin to sculpture and painting: bonsai design.  Caring for bonsai involves the science and skill of keeping potted trees healthy and growing: bonsai horticulture.

The aim of this book is to provide everything a beginner needs to know about to get started in bonsai, from selecting trees, to caring for trees, to potting and repotting trees, to styling trees, to displaying trees.

&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How to get Delphi ==

All you need for programming in Delphi / Object Pascal is Delphi or a related IDE. For buying Delphi see http://www.embarcadero.com. For a free (but less powerful) version of Delphi see http://www.turboexplorer.com. For a related open-source IDE see http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org.

Choose one of those links and install the IDE. You should know that there are some differences between Delphi and Lazarus. So the best variant would be Turbo Delphi Explorer.

In the previous chapters we have learnt all the letters of original ''Penti'', the ''velars'', the ''palatals'', the ''retroflexes'', the ''dentals'', the ''labials'' and the ''semi vowels'' in addition to the vowel carriers and ਸ and ਹ. Here we will learn the letters of the eighth row (ਨਵੀਨ ਵਰਗ) of Gurmukhi. This group of letters is called the Neo group because the letters have been added to Gurmukhi to represent sounds borrowed from Persian and other foreign languages.

== Eighth row of Gurmukhi ==

The Neo group consists of the following letters 
:&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਸ਼ ਖ਼ ਗ਼ ਜ਼ ਫ਼ ਲ਼&lt;/span&gt;
These are called ਸ਼ - ''susse pair bindi'', ਖ਼ - ''khukhe pair bindi'', ਗ਼ - ''gugge pair bindi'', 
ਜ਼ - ''jujje pair bindi'' , ਫ਼ - ''phuphe pair bindi'' and ਲ਼ - ''lulle pair bindi''. 
ਸ਼ is pronounced as /sh/, ਖ਼ as /khh/, ਗ਼ as /ghh/, ਜ਼ as /jhh/ , ਫ਼ as /phh/ and ਲ਼ as /lh/. 

;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਸ਼&lt;/span&gt; - sasse pair bindi : This is how words ''shark'' and ''shore'' are written in Gurmukhi 
::ਸ਼ਾ + ਰ + ਕ = ਸ਼ਾਰਕ = shark 
::ਸ਼ੋ + ਰ = ਸ਼ੋਰ = shore
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਖ਼&lt;/span&gt; - khakke pair bindi : This sound is not found in English. However here are some Punjabi examples
::ਖ਼ + ਤ = ਖ਼ਤ = letter
::ਤ + ਖ਼ + ਤ = ਤਖ਼ਤ = throne
::ਖ਼ + ਰ + ਗੋ + ਸ਼ = ਖ਼ਰਗੋਸ਼ = rabbit
::ਸ਼ਾ + ਖ਼ = ਸ਼ਾਖ਼ = branch
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਗ਼&lt;/span&gt; - gagge pair bindi : This sound is also not found in English. However here are some Punjabi examples
::ਗ਼ + ਮ + ਲਾ = ਗ਼ਮਲਾ = flower pot
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਜ਼&lt;/span&gt; - jajje pair bindi : This sound is equivalent to /z/. Here are some examples
::ਜ਼ਿ + ਪ = ਜ਼ਿਪ = zip
::ਜੈ + ਬ + ਰਾ = ਜ਼ੈਬਰਾ = zebra
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਫ਼&lt;/span&gt; - fufe pair bindi : As in 
::ਫ਼ਾ + ਰ + ਸੀ = ਫ਼ਾਰਸੀ = faarsi(persian)
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਲ਼&lt;/span&gt; - lulle pair bindi : 

Some of these letters merely represent the sounds borrowed from foreign languages but the use of others is lexically significant for that changes the word meanings. For example 
:ਗਲ =  talk and  ਗਲ਼ = decompose
:ਸੇਰ = a unit of measurement and ਸ਼ੇਰ = lion

== Exercises ==

1. Read these English words written in Gurmukhi
#ਸ਼ੈੱਡ
#ਸ਼ਾਉਟ
#ਐਸ਼
#ਗੱਸ਼
{{HideNseek|title=Solutions|text=
#Shed
#Shout
#Ash
#Gush}}
2. Write these English words in Gurmukhi
#Shop
#Shoe
#Rush
#Blush
#Push
{{HideNseek|title=Solutions|text=
#ਸ਼ੌ + ਪ = ਸ਼ੌਪ
#ਸ਼ੂ
#ਰੱ + ਸ਼ = ਰੱਸ਼
#ਬ + ਲੱ + ਸ਼ = ਬਲੱਸ਼
#ਪੁ + ਸ਼ = ਪੁਸ਼}}

== Summary ==

In this lesson we have learnt the five letters of the second row of Gurmukhi script. These letter are ਸ਼ ''susse pair bindi'', ਖ਼ ''khukhe pair bindi'', ਗ਼ ''gugge pair bindi'', ਜ਼ ''jujje pair bindi'' , ਫ਼ ''phuphe pair bindi'' and ਲ਼ ''lulle pair bindi''. We have now learnt the complete Gurmukhi alphabet: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:200%&quot;&gt;
: ੳ ਅ ੲ ਸ ਹ
: ਕ ਖ ਗ ਘ ਙ
: ਚ ਛ ਜ ਝ ਞ
: ਟ ਠ ਡ ਢ ਣ
: ਤ ਥ ਦ ਧ ਨ
: ਪ ਫ ਬ ਭ ਮ
: ਯ ਰ ਲ ਵ ੜ
: ਸ਼ ਖ਼ ਗ਼ ਜ਼ ਫ਼ ਲ਼
&lt;/span&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Structures ==

=== The if-structure ===
The if-structure executes a block of commands if a boolean expression returns True. A more simple to understand explanation is: It executes a block or a single command '''if''' a condition is true. Example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2-4&quot;&gt;
 begin
   if a = False then
     WriteLn('a is false')
   else WriteLn('a is true');
 end.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Never write &quot;if a = True&quot; but simply write &quot;if a&quot;. Writing &quot;if a = False&quot; is correct, but you can also write &quot;if not a&quot; or (with brackets) &quot;if (((((a)))))&quot; (or as many brackets you want), also &quot;(if (not(a)))&quot;.

Structure:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2-4&quot;&gt;
 begin
   if CONDITION then
     DO_ANYTHING
   else DO_THIS;
 end.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

or (for more than one command to execute):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2-8&quot;&gt;
 begin
   if CONDITION then
   begin
     DO_ANYTHING;
   end
   else begin
     DO_THIS;
   end;
 end.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Or without the else:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2-5&quot;&gt;
 begin
   if CONDITION then
   begin
     DO_THIS;
   end;
 end.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Except the last end there's always a semicolon behind the end. There is never a semicolon before an &quot;Else&quot;!

Example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
 var
   _Answer: string;
 begin
   WriteLn('Do you want to order a pizza?');
   ReadLn(_Answer);
   if _Answer = 'Yes' then
     WriteLn('You decided for yes!')
   else WriteLn('Don''t want to have a pizza?');
 end.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

You can start and end a string with a quote (&lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;) or a double quote (&lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;). How to write a quote or double quote in a string? It would end the string in the middle! If you have to write a quote in the text, you can start and end your string with a double quote or write your quote twice as it has been done at line 8. Do the same thing for a double quote.

=== The case structure ===
The Case structure is quite similar to the if structure with the following difference: You can more easily ask for several cases!

Structure:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 case VARIABLE_NAME of
   VALUE_1:
     DO_THIS;
   VALUE_N:
     DO_THIS
   else
     DO_THIS
   end;
 end;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

But with a case-structure you can only ask for Integers and chars.

== Operators ==

=== Expanding the condition ===
You can expand your condition with a few operators:

* AND (like &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; in [[C Programming|C]]): logical 'and': &lt;code&gt;'''if''' (a = 1) '''and''' (b = 2)&lt;/code&gt;. The value of the expression &quot;&lt;code&gt;(a = 1) '''and''' (b = 2)&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is TRUE if a is 1 and b is 2. Else, the value is FALSE and the ELSE-part will be executed (and not the part after THEN). Don't forget the brackets!

* OR (like &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; in C): 'or': &lt;code&gt;'''if''' (a = 1) '''or''' (b = 1)&lt;/code&gt;. If a is 1, b is 1 or both is 1, the value of the expression is TRUE.
* XOR: If only one of the conditions is true: &lt;code&gt;'''if''' (a = 1) '''xor''' (b = 2)&lt;/code&gt;. The expression is true if a is 1 or b is 2. If a is 1 AND b is 2, the value will be '''FALSE'''!
* NOT: The opposite of the expression.

It's also possible to interlink that operators. But then don't forget the brackets!

By the way: Every condition returns a boolean value. If it is TRUE, the then-part will be executed. If not, the processor goes to the else-part.

=== Operators such as 'equals' ===
Operators such as '=' are:

* =  -  equals
* &gt;  -  greater than
* &lt;  -  less than
* &lt;= -  less or equals
* &gt;= -  greater or equals
* &lt;&gt; -  not equal (less or greater, not the same)

=== Operators for calculating ===

* You can use ( and ) as brackets.
* / means 'divided by', the result is a float
* div means 'divided by', the result is a rounded integer
* &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; means 'times'
* + means 'plus'
* - means 'minus'

+ also means linking of strings or chars:

* string + string : string
* string + char : string
* char + char : string
* char + string : string
* string + number : error
* number + string : error
* number + number : number
* number + char : error
* char + number : error

== Loops ==

Loop means: A block will be executed many times. There are four types of loops:

=== For-to ===

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 for [var] := [start] to [end] do
 begin
   [execute the following code]
 end;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The var will count from [start] to [end] and after every counting step the code will be executed. Normally the [var] is defined as i, j or k, but you can also choose &lt;tt&gt;counting_var_with_this_name&lt;/tt&gt; or any name.

=== For-downto ===

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 for [var] := [start] downto [end] do
 begin
   [execute the following code]
 end;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The var will count '''down''' from [start] to [end] and after every counting step the code will be executed.

=== While-do ===

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 while [condition] do
 begin
   [code]
 end;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

While the condition is true, the code will be executed. Whether the condition is TRUE or FALSE will be checked '''BEFORE''' executing the code.

=== Repeat-until ===

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 repeat
   [code]
 until [condition];
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The code will be executed until the condition is true. Whether the condition is TRUE or FALSE will be checked '''AFTER''' executing the code.

== Setting values ==

The operator for setting values is &lt;tt&gt;:=&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;delphi&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 a := b;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

By executing, a will get the value of b.

EXAMPLE:

a equals 1; b equals 3

After executing:

a equals 3; b equals 3

and not:

a equals 1; b equals 1



Be careful with the order!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Punjabi/Navigation panel|Gurmukhi}}

Now that you have learnt the first five letters of the Gurmukhi script, it is time to turn attention to the vowels. Mantras represent vowels in Gurmukhi. The letters ੳ, ਅ and ੲ are not consonants but are merely the matra carriers. When a consonant is not available to attach matra one of these matra carriers is used. Armed with this knowledge you can now proceed to learn the 10 matras.

==Punjabi Vowels==
The following are the ten matras of Gurmukhi
:&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਅ ਆ ਇ ਈ ਉ ਊ ਏ ਐ ਓ ਔ&lt;/span&gt;
Here we have used letters ੳ, ਅ or ੲ only to demostrate how matras combine with other letters. In reality they can combine with any other letter as well. However when they combine with matra carriers they can individually combine with only the matras as they have above. We now explain each of the above matras. 
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਅ&lt;/span&gt; Muktaa : Mukta literally means free and therefore, has no symbol. It is equivalent to a in ''above'' or e in (British) ''dancer''. Hence forth in this module mukta vowel will be denoted by /a/. 
::ਅ + ਸ = ਅਸ /as/ = us 
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਆ&lt;/span&gt; Kannaa : Kanna is equivalent to a in ''alter'' or ''father''. Hence forth in this module we will denote kanna vowel with /aa/. 
::ਸਾ /saa/ = saw
::ਹਾ + ਉ = ਹਾਉ /haau/ = how
::ਹਾ + ਉ + ਸ = ਹਾਉਸ /haaus/ = house
::ਆ + ਇ = ਆਇ = eye
:Vowels in Punjabi come in pairs, a short vowel and a long one. Here mukta and kanna form one such pair where mukta is the short vowel and kanna the long one. ਇ and ਈ; ਉ and ਊ; ਏ and ਐ; ਓ and ਔ are other pairs.
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਇ&lt;/span&gt; Sihari : Sihari is equivalent to i in ''pin'' or ''thin''. Hence forth in this module we will denote sihari vowel with /i/. 
::ਹਿ + ਸ = ਹਿਸ = hiss
::ਆ + ਇ + ਸ = ਆਇਸ /aais/ = ice
::ਆ + ਇ = ਆਇ = eye
::ਉ + ਏ + ਸਿ + ਸ = ਉਏਸਿਸ = oasis
: A distinct characteristic of sihari is that unlike other matras it precedes the letter it is spoken after. &lt;br&gt;
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਈ&lt;/span&gt; Bihari : Bihari is equivalent to ea in ''teacher'' or ee in ''seek''. We will denote bihari vowel with /ii/ in this module. See the following examples of use of bihari.
::ਸੀ = see
::ਹੀ = he  
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਉ&lt;/span&gt; Aunkarh : Aunkarh is equivalent to u ''put'' or oo in ''book''. We will denote aunkarh vowel with /u/ in this module. See the following examples of use of aunkarh.
::ਹਾ + ਉ + ਸ = ਹਾਉਸ /haaus/ = house
::ਸਿ + ਉ = ਸਿਉ = sew 
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਊ&lt;/span&gt; Dulenkarh : Dulenkarh is equivalent to oo in ''boot''. We will denote dulenkarh vowel with /oo/ in this module. See the following example of use of dulenkarh.
::ਹੂ /hoo/ = who
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਏ&lt;/span&gt; Lanv : Lanv is equivalent to a as in ''hate'' or ''rate''. We will denote lanv vowel with /e/ in this module.See the following examples of use of lanv.
::ਏ + ਸ = ਏਸ = ace
::ਹੇ = hey
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਐ&lt;/span&gt; Dulanvan : Dulanvan is equivalent to a in ''matter'' or ''hat''. We will denote dulanvan vowel with /ae/ in this module. See the following examples of use of dulanvan.
::ਅ + ਸੈ + ਸ = ਅਸੈਸ = assess
::ਐ + ਸੇ = ਐਸੇ = essay
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਓ&lt;/span&gt; Horha : Horha is equivalent to o sound as in English home. Horha vowel will be denoted with /o/ in this module. See the following examples of use of horha.
::ਸੋ = sow
::ਹੋ = hoe
:'''NB''' : When horha is used with ੳ there is no space left above ੳ for placing horha and therefore whenever horha has to be used with ੳ the upper semi-circle is left open to denote horha matra. In all other cases horha is written as in &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 150%&quot;&gt;ਹੋ&lt;/span&gt;.
;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 200%&quot;&gt;ਔ&lt;/span&gt; Knaorha : Knourha is equivalent to o as in ''odd'' or ''hot''. Knaourha will be denoted with /ao/ in this wikibook. See the following examples of use of knaorha in Punjabi words.
::ਸੌ + ਸ = ਸੌਸ = sauce

== Summary ==

We have devoted this lesson to learning of the ten matras which represent the vowels. However we have still not touched the diacritics which form integral part of Gurmukhi script. We will learn the

      <text xml:space="preserve">Appropriate soil is one of the essential elements to maintaining healthy bonsai.  Bonsai soil serves several key purposes: it proves a secure base for the tree to stabilize itself; it holds water for the roots to drink; it holds air for the roots to breath; it holds nutrients for the roots to absorb; and it provides an attractive visual setting for the tree.

One thing in particular distinguishes bonsai soil from typical soils: ''drainage''.  Very few trees like to have &quot;wet feet&quot;, i.e., soil that is always soggy in the bottom layers.  These conditions starve the roots of oxygen and may kill them; damaged or dead roots are then likely to rot away.  (&quot;Root rot&quot;, a variety of fungal infections that destroy root tissue, is often thought to be caused by too much moisture, but according to bonsai master Walter Pall root rot is the consequence, not the cause, of dead roots.)  Beyond good drainage, bonsai growers recommend a wide (sometimes conflicting) array of soil advice, so there is no single &quot;best soil&quot; recipe.

In many cases, &quot;soil&quot; is actually a misnomer, as the potting medium may contain no soil in the traditional sense.  For trees growing in nature, the decaying organic matter in soil provides nutrients necessary for growth.  In bonsai, limited soil volume means than any nutrients from natural organic matter is quickly depleted, so fertilizer and sometimes other supplements are added to the potting medium to provide nutrition.  The fine particles of clay and organic matter in potting soil and most natural types of soil hold too much water and not enough air for all the but the most water-loving bonsai, so bonsai soils usually contain generous portions of course inorganic particles, such as grit and/or porous clay.  These inorganic particles allow water to drain freely and create numerous small air pockets in the soil.  Baked clay particles (including natural volcanic clays such akadama) also retain water and nutrients.  To hold more water, most bonsai soils also contain some kind of organic component; the most common choice is small pieces of conifer bark (e.g., pine bark or fir bark), which provides better drainage and breaks down slower than peat moss or generic potting soil.

Water requirements vary from species to species and climate to climate, so traditional bonsai soils are customized meet the needs of a particular plant and grower.  Typically, evergreen conifers (such as pines, junipers, and spruces) are allowed to dry out almost completely between waterings, so more porous soils light on organic components are used.  Deciduous trees vary widely in water needs; some (such maples) do well in very fast-draining soil, while others (such as Chinese Elms) can tolerate slightly moister conditions.  Many conifers can go completely dry for short periods without any ill effects, while some flowering evergreens (such as boxwoods) will die if allowed to dry completely.  In traditional soils with significant fine particles, the organic and inorganic portions of soil are balanced so that a tree goes nearly dry (but not totally dry!) between waterings.

Traditional bonsai soils and watering methods were developed before baked clay products such as arcillite were available.  Baked clay particles are course and shed excess water quickly, but are also porous and retain water and nutrients.  Soils based on such particles are much more flexible than traditional soils; they can be watered more frequently without concern for overwatering, since they admit plenty of air even when wet, and do not need to be monitored as carefully.  Some growers even plant their trees is pure baked clay, although such soils may shift around more (thus disrupting root growth) compared with mixtures with at least some fine, sticky particles.

==Soil components==
These are some of the most common components of bonsai soil.  Almost all soil components should be sifted to remove dust and very small particles, which can clog a pot and hamper drainage.

===Organic===
*'''Conifer bark''' - in particular, &quot;aged pine bark&quot; or &quot;aged fir bark&quot;.  Conifer bark is often sold as &quot;orchid bark&quot; (since orchids are usually planted in pure bark), as soil conditioner made of &quot;decomposed pine bark&quot; or the like, and as mulch.  Most sources of conifer bark must be screened to remove large pieces (larger than about 1/4&quot; or 1/8&quot;) and very small pieces (smaller than about 1/16&quot;).
*'''Peat moss''' - retains a lot of water, so it is used sparingly.  Peat moss is slightly acidic; some plants (in particular, azaleas) need acidic conditions to thrive.
*'''Potting soil''' - not widely recommended, but it works and is easy to find.  May also contain slow-release fertilizer pellets, which can supplement periodic fertilization.
*'''Leftovers''' - the decomposed organic components from used soil is often the most convenient source of water-retaining organic material, especially soil from the same tree.  There may be a danger of transferring harmful microorganisms (such as root rot).  Keeping some soil from a previous potting is also a way to preserve helpful microorganisms (such as the symbiotic ''Mycorrhizae'' fungus), which is especially important for pine trees (although not as important as proper soil drainage!).

===Inorganics===
*'''Akadama''' - the traditional soil of Japanese bonsai.  A natural volcanic clay surface-mined in Japan, akadama is an expensive (and fast-disappearing) soil component.  It breaks down relatively quickly (a year or two) when exposed to freezing and thawing, but many bonsai artists attest to superior root development compared to manufactured substitutes.
*'''Arcillite''' - baked montmorillonite clay, sold as Turface, Schultz Aquatic Soil, and other products.  Arcillite has an attractive reddish color that darkens to brown when wet.  It has high nutrient-retention properties, and is very stable and long-lasting.
*'''Baked fuller's earth''' - variable baked clay products, sold as an oil absorbent (e.g., Oil-Dri) and a variety of cat litters (e.g., Johnny Cat), among other products.  The most economical, and often easiest to find, porous clay component.  Some types of baked clay break down faster than others, and some are less attractive than others.
*'''Horticultural perlite''' - A very light-weight, fast-draining substance that holds a small amount of water.  Perlite floats in water, breaks apart easily, and can be quite the eyesore on the soil surface.  However, it is a helpful component in large pots, which can be extremely heavy when filled with dense soil components. 
*'''Horticultural vermiculite'''- A light-weight, brown substance than retains more water than perlite.
*'''Haydite'''
*'''Crushed granite''' - an inert, non-porous particle that promotes drainage, often sold as poultry grit.  The sharp edges are thought to stimulate splitting of roots and the growth of many small drinking roots.
*'''Flint grit''' - an inert, non-porous particle like crushed granite.

==Recipes==

Probably the most common general-purpose soil recipe is:
*1 part conifer bark
*1 part porous clay (akadama, arcillite, or baked fuller's earth)
*1 part non-porous inorganic (stone grit or large-grained sand)

An easy alternative is:
*2 parts porous clay
*1 part potting soil

Soil mixtures should be rinsed thoroughly to remove clay dust before use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Malware''' ==
DPWEISBORD

Imagine that you are having a great day and then all of a sudden your head starts to ache, your muscles may hurt, you may start to get a fever or the chills.  These are all the signs that a person can be coming down with a bug or virus.  Sometimes the bug can last for only a couple of days and sometimes it may take longer for the body to rid itself of the germs.

For a computer, getting sick can cause a lot of headaches as well.  Malware, which many times is also known as Malicious Software is a general term.  In the simplest form, it is a general term used by many computer professionals to describe annoying, dangerous, or intrusive computer code. Many times malware can cause minor problems, but sometimes these can turn major.

Malware is a term used to broadly classify a form of software which is installed in a computer system mostly without the owners permission with malicious intentions.

It is also important to note that many times the media uses the term computer virus to describe malware.  While malware can be a computer virus, not all computer viruses are malware.  In addition, malware should not be confused with defective software.

Types of malware may include worms, computer viruses, trojan horses, adware and other unwanted dangerous software.

== '''Types of Malware''' ==

-Spyware
-Adware
-Trojans
-Viruses
-Browser Hijackers
-Rootkit
-Web bug or Web beacons

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Pubs of Southampton ==


Data on [http://www.pubsinsouthampton.co.uk/ Pubs in Southampton] has collected by a couple of enthusiasts. John Goodwin created an [http://www.johngoodwin.me.uk/pubs/models/pubs.rdf RDF] representation of this data and an [http://www.johngoodwin.me.uk/pubs/pubindex.html interface] to the data.

== Conversion to KML ==

The RDF is straightforward to convert to KML. The RDF uses a number of namespaces, not all of which are used in this extract. 

March 2009: This script was discovered to be broken. The base RDF file has been changed to add a new namespace for addresses [http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#] in place of the local pub namespace. Since there is of course no notification of such changes, the user of published RDF data sets is not in a much better position than the web scraper, unless the application is written to first check that the vocabulary assumed by the application is still used. However there is no mechanism for expressing the mixture of bits of vocabs used in a RDF dataset. If there were, at least the interfaces could be checked by having a similar definition of the parts actually used in this application to compare. 

5 March 2008

Sadly John has been forced to take down this data set due to adverse reaction to one of the pub reviews.

      <comment>/* Perimeter of Circle */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Perimeter of [[../Circle|Circle]]==
The circles perimeter &lt;math&gt;\textstyle O&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated using the following formula

:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle O=2 \pi r&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \pi = 3.1415926535 \dots&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r&lt;/math&gt; the radius of the circle.

==Perimeter of [[../Polygons|Polygons]]==
The perimeter of a polygon &lt;math&gt;\textstyle S&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n&lt;/math&gt; number of sides abbreviated &lt;math&gt;s_1,s_2,\dots,s_n&lt;/math&gt; can be caculated using the following formula

:&lt;math&gt;S=\sum_{k=1}^n s_k&lt;/math&gt;.

==Arclength of Circles==

The arclength &lt;math&gt;\textstyle b&lt;/math&gt; of a given circle with radius &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated using

:&lt;math&gt;b=\frac{v}{2\pi}2\pi r=vr&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle v&lt;/math&gt; is the angle given in radians.
==Arclength of [[../Curves|Curves]]==
If a curve &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \gamma&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; have a parameter form &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbf{r}\big(t\big)=\big(x\big(t\big),y\big(t\big),z\big(t\big)\big)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\textstyle t \in \big[a,b\big]&lt;/math&gt;, then the arclength can be calculated using the following fomula

:&lt;math&gt;S=\int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{ \left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2 } \, dt=\int_{\textstyle \gamma} \sqrt{ \left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2 } \, dt&lt;/math&gt;.

Derivation of formula can be found using differential geometry on infinitely small triangles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generally, each program in Windows has its own virtual memory space. In other words, one program cannot change variables in another program. ''Marshalling'' is the process of passing data and memory addresses between applications.
There are several ways different programs can communicate with each other.

===Shared file(s)===
This is a 'roll your own' solution. Both applications access files in a shared directory, reading and writing data from them to communicate. The simplest method is for the sending application to write a separate file for each message and the receiving application to delete those files once processed. The sending application should create the file with exclusive access so the receiving application cannot access a half-written file. There should also be a mechanism for re-synchronising if one or the other application is shut down during a conversation.

The main downside of this approach is that the receiving application must poll the shared directory at regular intervals (e.g. by using a Timer control). This generates harddisk/network traffic, and the polling interval limits the responsiveness of the conversation.

===Windows messages===
This method consists of overriding the WndProc method in a Form to receive, and the PostMessage Win32 API call to send a custom Windows message.

===.NET Remoting===
This method has the advantage of easily accommodating both communication between programs on the same computer, and programs on different computers in the same network (or even across the internet). It uses the System.Runtime.Remoting namespace, which you can add via Project References.

==Older methods==
These methods are not used much anymore, but may be encountered if you are trying to communicate with a legacy application.
====DDE====
''Dynamic Data Exchange'' was the original method Windows used for programs to communicate with each other. It is still used by Windows for &quot;Cut and Paste&quot;. 
====OLE====
''Object Linking and Embedding'' 
====COM====
''Common Object Model''. 
*Reference counting
*Late binding via IDispatch
====OLE Automation====
OLE Automation
====ActiveX====
ActiveX EXEs and DLLs

== Project Scope ==

Greetings.  Your recent file uploads are of copyrighted material (logos or book covers).  These could qualify for being kept under fair use, but they may be replaceable or not essential, and as such they would then be deleted.  Furthermore, you may be confusing Wikibooks for [[w:|Wikipedia]].  We don't create short encyclopedic articles here, but rather whole books of many pages that teach something about a certain subject, like Physics.  Your recent contributions would be better suited there.  Please see [[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks?]] for more information. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:46, 1 September 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* What might an alien phonology have in it */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Navlist/Top}}

==What is an alien phonology?==

An alien phonology is a system of sounds &amp;mdash; and perhaps other, non-vocal signals &amp;mdash; for a language designed to be used by beings that are not human.  It is designed to take advantage of a non-human anatomy, and will often use mechanisms of sound/signal production that would be convenient for the beings the language is made for, but are either inconvenient or impossible for humans.

==What might an alien phonology have in it==
An alien phonology would contain any phoneme (sound that is seen as being different form the other sounds) that would be easy for the alien to use.
It's not too hard to imagine one, without even leaving Earth.
*Plates that make noise when they glide over one another.
:Used by many insects, chirp chirp!
*Colour changes.
:Many octopuses can change colour fast enough to use colour phonemically (to distinguish words form one another).
*No vocal cords.
:Birds have no vocal cords.  Instead, they have a different kind of vocal organ called a [[w:Syrinx (biology)|syrinx]].
*Two air streams
:Some kinds of birds use two air streams when they sing.  (Mentioned [http://www.annalsnyas.org/cgi/content/abstract/1016/1/109 here].)
*Non-aerial sound transmission
:There is evidence that pachyderms can send and receive sounds through the ground.
:This could be useful for a place where there is little air.
*Flashing lights
:Some species of deep water fish communicate warning signals with pockets of bio-luminescent bacteria that they can cover and reveal alternately. 



Any and all methods of noise production and such can be used as phonemic signals, just because red is not phonemic to humans does not mean it isn't for octopi. Just because the smell of sulfur doesn't make an English word an adverb, doesn't mean it can't for an alien.

Alien language should be built around alien anatomy, I suggest that you figure out how they look, how would they make their sounds? what would be the most effective method of communication in their environment, would sound be used at all? 

How do they think, who says they use verbs and nouns? I once read an article about a language that was so context-dependent that there was a play that was simply the same word ~6,000 times, with no rhythm or stress changes, but the fact that each word had been preceded by the same word changed its meaning.

Throw away traditional thinking when you work with aliens, they are after all, alien.
When you're working with aliens, anything goes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It's a little late but I'm still recovering from a night of comics, games and tasty beverages. Some of the Zam team attended Sony Online Entertainments block party that they've been holding annually during comic-con for three years now. Ryan &quot;Draknorr&quot; Bohmann and I arrived fashionably late after the first couple of buses of fans had arrived from Comic-con. The SOE band was already playing, the food was hot and tasty and the beer was icy cold and ready to serve - it was a beautiful, cool summer day in San Diego.

We met with the Free Realms team to take a look at the game and let me just say: I was definitely impressed with how far along its come. Free Realms is a casual MMO designed for a very broad range of players. We were shown several different areas that were actually designed for specific demographics. The game looks amazing but will require less system resources than World of Warcraft. While there are things I personally don't like about it because of my affinity for hardcore gaming, this game will have plenty to offer children, families, and casual or new gamers. It was great to see it in action; I look forward to seeing it again at Fanfaire in August.

After we were done checking out Free Realms the DC Universe Online line tour caught our attention. While we had played it several times throughout the week on the Comic-con floor, it was too noisy to really enjoy. During the tour we watched a short gameplay video and then there were two machines available for play. Every time I play DCUO I enjoy it a little bit more. The game looks amazing and there is nothing boring about the gameplay, which can be described as constant action along the lines of a button masher console game combined with a strategic MMO.

Despite its projected 2010 launch, the game already looks very polished and ready to play. We were actually told several times that there were people on the Comic-con floor asking where they could buy it and how long had it been on the market. Our biggest concern was the camera movement / angles and the possibility that they'd be releasing a product that wasn't ready and &quot;rushed&quot; out the door. It was made very clear however that there is no way that this game will launch until it's 100% ready.

The battle raged on inside the DC Universe but we had another agenda: we we're foaming at the mouth to see The Agency. Unfortunately the line was incredibly long but we endured and made our way inside yet another building to get our first look. The tour was unfortunately very basic, with nothing playable and just two videos. The only video worth mentioning was the second one that actually walked you through an in-game spy mission. The graphics are great, but sort of a less innovative version of Team Fortress 2. I don't want to judge the gameplay because it's still too early to tell. I will say this though: The Agency is nothing like anything else they've ever tried; kudos to them for thinking outside the box and giving new concepts a try.

As we ventured back outside the SOE band was in the middle of J.J. Cale's &quot;Cocaine&quot;, the crowds were bigger than we had seen them all day and members of the Community team were bussing dirty tables. It was indeed a good day to be an MMO gamer in San Diego.</text>

==What is etymology==
Etymology is the study of the origin of words, for example the modern English word &quot;today&quot; from the on-line etymological dictionary

&quot;
O.E. todæge, to dæge &quot;on (the) day,&quot; from to &quot;at, on&quot; (see to) + dæge, dative of dæg &quot;day.&quot; Generally written as two words until 16c., after which it usually was written to-day until early 20c. Similar constructions exist in other Gmc. languages (cf. Du. van daag &quot;from-day,&quot; Dan., Swed. i dag &quot;in day&quot;). Ger. heute is from O.H.G. hiutu, from P.Gmc. *hiu tagu &quot;on (this) day,&quot; with first element from PIE pronomial stem *ki-, represented by L. cis &quot;on this side.&quot; 
&quot;

It might not be too far to say that some words in a conlang will not have an etymology, but doubtless most will.
All of the words in esperanto are taken from another language, so all of them will share most of their etymology with the root. so ''kiso'' comes from the english ''kiss'', and shares the rest of that words etymology.

In another conlang, Jorayn, the word ''dufadufath'', meaning ''deer'' has the etymology that follows

&quot;Imitative of the sound made by a deer's feet as they fall upon the freshly rained upon earth of the forest floor&quot;


So the etymology might be more complex, such as that of Tolkien, who had the [[w:Elvish languages (Middle-earth)#Fictional development|Quendian language family]].

above is a chart tracing the etymology of the word for ''people''

''kwendī'' -&gt; ''pendi'' -&gt; ''penni''


If you want to have full etymologies for you language it would be best to have it evolve from a proto-language. Following sound changes and lexical shifts along the way.

==Missing License==
Many of the images you have recently uploaded are missing a license. They will be deleted after August 5th if one if not applied by then. It appears it is your own personal work, so, I woud suggest adding &lt;nowiki&gt;{{pd:self}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to each image. That license realeases it into public domain. If you need further help you may contact me on my talk page.[[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 14:27, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

== [[Communication Systems]] ==

I've been watching your work, and you're doing a really good job! The stuff you are writing is excellent. If you want to move pages around, rename pages, delete pages, or add new pages, please feel free to do so. The outline that I had was a bit naive and could probably use some improvement. If you need any other help (including help with your image licensing issue, discussed above) don't hesitate to ask. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:55, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

== Re: Image Licenses ==

It's actually very easy. All the images are pages, just like pages in your book. The only difference is that they have the word &quot;Image:&quot; in front of them. So, you can go to &quot;[[:Image:Transmission line.gif]]&quot; and add any information that you missed when you uploaded them. Here is a list of all images you've uploaded:

http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?limit=50&amp;title=Special%3AContributions&amp;contribs=user&amp;target=Jugandi&amp;namespace=6&amp;year=&amp;month=-1

I have a bot that I can use to help fix all these problems. If you would like me to automatically fix all your images, just tell me what you want them to say and I can do it. If you would like to do it yourself, or if every image needs something different, that's fine too. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:07, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

:Well, it looks like Whiteknight beat me to helping you. But, maybe you're lucky, I don't have a bot so I would have had to do it manually. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 22:16, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

== Correlative Coding ==

I removed a red link (a link to a page that doesn't yet exist, in case you've never heard that term before) to a page called &quot;Correlative Coding&quot; from the TOC of the [[Communication Systems]] book. It's a topic that I think might be better suited in the [[Data Coding Theory]] book instead. Let me know if you disagree, I can always put the link back if it's better where it was. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:58, 4 August 2008 (UTC)

== Images which contain only text ==

FYI: http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Assistance&amp;diff=1247114&amp;oldid=1247025

In general, everything is easier if we display information with text, wikitext, and LaTeX markup. In practice, I know it's difficult to translate images like these into text, especially if you already have the images in your possession, or if you aren't totally familiar with our LaTeX and Tables markup. 

I would say right now not to worry about this issue. I may go through and try to replace some of these images with text, if I think I can do it accurately. I hope you don't mind if I remove and possibly delete some of these images if they can be adequately replaced. Let me know if it's a problem. Nothing is going to change drastically or quickly, however. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:20, 6 August 2008 (UTC)

:You're right, some kind of macro or automation or simplification for our messy tables syntax would be much appreciated. Unfortunately, no intrepid programmers have taken up the challenge yet. I might be able to put together something with javascript, but the first step would be to know what it ''should be'' and how we could make it better then it already is. Maybe that's a task that I can work on later. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:24, 6 August 2008 (UTC)

::Please see my latest comment at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance#images in mainspace pages which contain only text/formulas]] and if you get a chance take a look at my changes.  Thanks, [[User:Jeremyb|Jeremyb]] ([[User talk:Jeremyb|talk]]) 08:11, 7 August 2008 (UTC)

== Preview ==

I would suggest you use the preview function a bit more. Making dozens of edits like this[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Communication_Systems/Time-Division_Multiplexing&amp;curid=47411&amp;diff=1248440&amp;oldid=1248439] in a row is clogging up the recent changes. I would also suggest that you mark your minor edits, which adding line breaks definitely are. [[User:Icewedge|Icewedge]] ([[User talk:Icewedge|talk]]) 23:22, 8 August 2008 (UTC)</text>

__NOTOC__
{{recipesummary|Cheesecake recipes||Slightly over 5 hours|3}}

'''Vancouver Cheesecake''' is a light, baked [[Cookbook:cheesecake|cheesecake]] variant, which uses no crust.  It is typically served chilled with fresh berries and a warmed sauce.

== Ingredients ==

=== Cake ===

* 500 ml [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]], softened to room temperature
* 125 ml [[Cookbook:Ricotta|ricotta cheese]]
* 6 large eggs
* 250 ml [[Cookbook:Cream|whipping cream]]
* 80 ml white sugar
* 5 ml of lemon juice
* 1 [[Cookbook:Vanilla Bean|vanilla bean]], or 10 ml of pure vanilla extract

=== Sauce ===

* 250 ml of fresh, cleaned [[Cookbook:raspberry|raspberries]]
* 125 ml water
* 60 ml brown sugar
* 30 ml rum

Additionally, raspberries should be served with the cake.

== Procedure ==

=== Cake ===

# Preheat oven to 160°C
# [[Cookbook:beat|Beat]] the cream cheese and ricotta together until smooth, continue beating as you mix in the sugar, then the eggs.
# Slowly beat in the whipping cream
# Add lemon juice.
# To add the bean, using a sharp knife, slice down the length of the bean, peal open and scrape down the bean to collect the contents.  Using a spatula or second knife, scrape the contents of the bean into the mixture.  [[Cookbook:fold|Fold]] in.
# Pour into large baking pan, or series of loaf pans.
# Bake at 150°C for 45 minutes or so, slightly less time in loaf pans.  The cake should still be jelly-like in the centre when done.  Remove and allow to cool, then refrigerate for a minimum of 4 hours.

=== Sauce ===

# [[Cookbook:puree|Puree]] raspberries and strain through [[Cookbook:Cheese cloth|cheese cloth]] into a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]].
# Place berry mix on burner at medium, add water.  Stir occasionally.
# When warm, stir in sugar and your rum of choice, turn burner to high.  Increase stirring rate.
# After sauce has reached a boil, turn down to a low-medium range and allow to simmer for 15 minutes, stirring constantly.  Then remove from burner and allow to cool.

Slice, sprinkle berries and drizzle on sauce, serve.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* Store sauce in an air-tight container in the fridge. Can last for up to two weeks, heat before serving.
* If not planning to serve in 3 days, store cake in a freezer, in an air-tight container which will not pop open.  Cake should last two weeks if properly stored.
* To ensure quality cheesecake, be certain the ricotta and cream cheese mix is absolutely smooth prior to continuing on to the next step.
* Of course, the cake can be served without berries, or sauce, but can also be served with berries other than the raspberries used in the recipe as well as an alternative sauce.
* This cheesecake can also be served on a crust, as with more traditional recipes, this is however contrary to the Vancouver-style of cheesecake.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An equation of the form

&lt;math&gt;{dy \over dx}+ f(x)y = g(x)y^n&lt;/math&gt;

can be made linear by the substitution &lt;math&gt;z=y^{1-n}&lt;/math&gt;

Its derivative is

&lt;math&gt;{dz \over dx}=(1-n)y^{-n}{dy \over dx}&lt;/math&gt;

So that multiplying it by &lt;math&gt;y^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;

The equation can be turned into

&lt;math&gt;{dy \over dx}y^{-n} + f(x)y^{1-n} = g(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Or

&lt;math&gt;{dz \over dx} + (1-n)f(x)z = (1-n)g(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Which is linear.

===Jacobi Equation===

The Jacobi equation

&lt;math&gt;(a_1+b_1x+c_1y)(xdy-ydx)-(a_2+b_2x+c_2y)dy+(a_3+b_3x+c_3y)dx=0&lt;/math&gt;

can be turned into the Bernoulli equation with the appropriate substitutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Riccati Equation

&lt;math&gt;{dy \over dx} + f(x)y^2 + g(x)y + h(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

is different from the previous differential equations because, in general, the solution is not expressible in terms of elementary integrals.

However, we can obtain a general solution from a single particular solution when one is known.

Let &lt;math&gt;y_1(x)&lt;/math&gt; be a particular solution, and let &lt;math&gt;y(x)=y_1+z&lt;/math&gt;

so that the equation becomes

&lt;math&gt;{dy_1 \over dx} + {dz \over dx} + f(x)(y_1^2+2y_1z+z^2)+g(x)(y_1+z)+h(x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;= {dz \over dx} + (2y_1f(x)+g(x))z+f(x)z^2=0&lt;/math&gt;

which is a Bernoulli equation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Equations without y==

Consider a differential equation of the form

F(x, y')=0.

If we can solve for y', then we can simply integrate the equation to get the a solution in the form y=f(x). However, sometimes it may be easier to solve for x. In that case, we get

&lt;math&gt;x=f(y')&lt;/math&gt;

Then differentiating by y,

&lt;math&gt;{1 \over y'}={df \over dy'}{dy' \over dy}&lt;/math&gt;

Which makes it become

&lt;math&gt;y=C+\int y' {df \over dy'} dy'&lt;/math&gt;.

The two equations

&lt;math&gt;x=f(y')&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;y=C+\int y' {df \over dy'} dy'&lt;/math&gt;

is a parametric solution in terms of y'. To obtain an explicit solution, we eliminate y' between the two equations.

If it is possible to express

F(x, y')=0

parametrically as x=f(t), y'=g(t),

then one can differentiate the first equation:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{y'}\frac{dy}{dt}=f'(t)&lt;/math&gt;

So that

&lt;math&gt;y=C+\int g(t)f'(t)dt&lt;/math&gt;

to obtain a parametric solution in terms of t. If it is possible to eliminate t, then one can obtain an integral solution.

==Equations without x==
Similarly, if the equation

F(y, y')=0.

can be solved for y, write y=f(y'). Then the following solution, which can be obtained by the same process as above is the parametric solution:

y=f(y')

&lt;math&gt;x=C+\int \frac{f'(y')}{y'} dy'&lt;/math&gt;

In addition, if one can express y and y' parametrically

y=f(t), y'=g(t),

then the parametric solution is 

y=f(t),

&lt;math&gt;x=C+\int \frac {f'(t)}{g(t)} dt&lt;/math&gt;

so that if the parameter t can be eliminated, then one can obtain an integral solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;math&gt;y'=f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; has a solution &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the initial condition &lt;math&gt;y(x_0)=y_0&lt;/math&gt;, then it must satisfy the following integral equation:

&lt;math&gt;y=y_0+\int_{x_0}^x f(t, y(t))dt&lt;/math&gt;

Now we will solve this equation by the method of successive approximations.

Define &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; as:

&lt;math&gt;y_1=y_0+\int_{x_0}^x f(t,y_0)dt&lt;/math&gt;

And define &lt;math&gt;y_n&lt;/math&gt; as

&lt;math&gt;y_n=y_0+\int_{x_0}^x f(t,y_{n-1})dt&lt;/math&gt;

We will now prove that:

# If &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is bounded and the Lipschitz condition is satisfied, then the sequence of functions converges to a continuous function
# This function satisfies the differential equation
# This is the unique solution to this differential equation with the given initial condition.

== Proof ==

First, we prove that &lt;math&gt;y_n&lt;/math&gt; lies in the box, meaning that &lt;math&gt;|y_n(x)-y_0|&lt;\frac{1}{2}h&lt;/math&gt;. We prove this by induction. First, it is obvious that &lt;math&gt;|y_1(x)-y_0|\le\frac{1}{2}h&lt;/math&gt;. Now suppose that &lt;math&gt;|y_{n-1}(x)-y_0|\le\frac{1}{2}h&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;|f(t,y_{n-1}(t))|\le M&lt;/math&gt; so that

&lt;math&gt;|y_n(x)-y_0|\le\int_{x_0}^x |f(t,y_{n-1}(t))|dt\le M(x-x_0)\le \frac{1}{2}Mw\le \frac{1}{2}h&lt;/math&gt;. This proves the case when &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and the case when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is proven similarily.

We will now prove by induction that &lt;math&gt;|y_n(x)-y_{n-1}(x)|&lt;\frac{MK^{n-1}}{n!}(x-x_0)^n&lt;/math&gt;. First, it is obvious that &lt;math&gt;|y_1(x)-y_0|&lt;M(x-x_0)&lt;/math&gt;. Now suppose that it is true up to n-1. Then

&lt;math&gt;|y_n(x)-y_{n-1}(x)|\le\int_{x_0}^x |f(t,y_{n-1}(t))-f(t,y_{n-2}(t))|dt&lt;\int_{x_0}^x K|y_{n-1}(t)-y_{n-2}(t)|dt&lt;/math&gt; due to the Lipschitz condition.

Now,

&lt;math&gt;|y_n(x)-y_{n-1}(x)|&lt;\frac{MK^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}\int_{x_0}^x ||u-x_0|^{n-1}du=\frac{MK^{n-1}}{n!}|x-x_0|^n&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, the series of series &lt;math&gt;y_0+\sum_{n=1}^\infty (y_n(x)-y_{n-1}(x))&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely and uniformly convergent for &lt;math&gt;|x-x_0|\le\frac{1}{2}w&lt;/math&gt; because it is less than the exponential function.

Therefore, the limit function &lt;math&gt;y(x)=y_0+\sum_{n=1}^\infty (y_n(x)-y_{n-1}(x))=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}y_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; exists and is a continuous function for &lt;math&gt;|x-x_0|\le\frac{1}{2}w&lt;/math&gt;.

Now we will prove that this limit function satisfies the differential equation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;math&gt;({dy \over dx})^n+F_1(x,y)({dy \over dx})^{n-1}+...+F_{n-1}(x,y)({dy \over dx})+F_n(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

can theoretically be factored into

&lt;math&gt;({dy \over dx}-r_1(x,y))({dy \over dx}-r_2(x,y))...({dy \over dx}-r_n(x,y))&lt;/math&gt;

Then any solution for the individual factors will be a solution to the whole equation. The general equation can be found to be the product of the solutions.

&quot;The Beauty of Fractals gives an almost correct computer program for the distance estimation shown in the right image. A possible reason that that method did not gain ground is that the procedure in this program is seriously flawed: The calculation of zk is performed (and completed) before the calculation of z'k, and not after as it ought to be (z'k + 1 uses zk, not zk + 1). For the successive calculation of z'k, we must know f'(zk) (which in this case is 2zk). In order to avoid the calculation of zk (k = 0, 1, 2, ...) again, this sequence is saved in an array. Using this array, z'k + 1 = 2zkz'k + 1 is calculated up to the last iteration number, and it is stated that overflow can occur. If overflow occurs the point is regarded as belonging to the boundary (the bail-out condition). If overflow does not occur, the calculation of the distance can be performed. Apart from it being untrue that overflow can occur, the method makes use of an unnecessary storing and repetition of the iteration, making it unnecessarily slower and less attractive. The following remark in the book is nor inviting either: &quot;It turns out that the images depend very sensitively on the various choices&quot; (bail-out radius, maximum iteration number, overflow, thickness of the boundary and blow-up factor). Is it this nonsense that has got people to lose all desire for using and generalizing the method?&quot; (Gertbuschmann)</text>

==Section A - What is Anarchism? (Introduction)==
Modern civilisation faces three potentially catastrophic crises: 
# social breakdown, a shorthand term for rising rates of poverty, homelessness, crime, violence, alienation, drug and alcohol abuse, social isolation, political apathy, dehumanisation, the deterioration of community structures of self-help and mutual aid, etc.
# destruction of the planet's delicate ecosystems on which all complex forms of life depend.
# the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons.

Orthodox opinion, including that of Establishment &quot;experts,&quot; mainstream media, and politicians, generally regards these crises as separable, each having its own causes and therefore capable of being dealt with on a piecemeal basis, in isolation from the other two. Obviously, however, this &quot;orthodox&quot; approach isn't working, since the problems in question are getting worse. Unless some better approach is taken soon, we are clearly headed for disaster, either from catastrophic war, ecological Armageddon, or a descent into urban savagery - or all of the above. 

Anarchism offers a unified and coherent way of making sense of these crises, by tracing them to a common source. This source is the principle of '''hierarchical authority''', which underlies the major institutions of all &quot;civilised&quot; societies, whether capitalist or &quot;communist.&quot; Anarchist analysis therefore starts from the fact that all of our major institutions are in the form of hierarchies, i.e. organisations that concentrate power at the top of a pyramidal structure, such as corporations, government bureaucracies, armies, political parties, religious organisations, universities, etc. It then goes on to show how the authoritarian relations inherent in such hierarchies negatively affect individuals, their society, and culture. In the first part of this FAQ ('''sections A to E''') we will present the anarchist analysis of hierarchical authority and its negative effects in greater detail. 

It should not be thought, however, that anarchism is just a critique of modern civilisation, just &quot;negative&quot; or &quot;destructive.&quot; Because it is much more than that. For one thing, it is also a proposal for a free society. Emma Goldman expressed what might be called the &quot;anarchist question&quot; as follows: ''&quot;The problem that confronts us today ... is how to be one's self and yet in oneness with others, to feel deeply with all human beings and still retain one's own characteristic qualities.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Emma, Red Emma Speaks: An Emma Goldman Reader, 3rd Edition, Alix Kates
Shulman (Ed.), Humanity Books, New York, 1998. pp. 158-159&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, how can we create a society in which the potential for each individual is realised but not at the expense of others? In order to achieve this, anarchists envision a society in which, instead of being controlled '''''&quot;from the top down&quot;''''' through hierarchical structures of centralised power, the affairs of humanity will, to quote Benjamin Tucker, ''&quot;be managed by individuals or voluntary associations.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, George (ed.), The Anarchist Reader, Fontana, Glasgow, 1987. pp. 149&lt;/ref&gt; While later sections of the FAQ ('''sections I and J''') will describe anarchism's positive proposals for organising society in this way, &quot;from the bottom up,&quot; some of the constructive core of anarchism will be seen even in the earlier sections. The positive core of anarchism can even be seen in the anarchist critique of such flawed solutions to the social question as Marxism and right-wing &quot;libertarianism&quot; ('''sections F and H, respectively''').

As Clifford Harper elegantly puts it, ''&quot;[l]ike all great ideas, anarchism is pretty simple when you get down to it - human beings are at their best when they are living free of authority, deciding things among themselves rather than being ordered about.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Harper, Clifford, Anarchy: A Graphic Guide, Camden Press, London, 1987. p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their desire to maximise individual and therefore social freedom, anarchists wish to dismantle all institutions that repress people: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;Common to all Anarchists is the desire to free society of all political and social coercive institutions which stand in the way of the development of a free humanity.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Rocker, Rudolf, Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice, AK Press, Edinburgh/Oakland, 2004. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As we'll see, all such institutions are hierarchies, and their repressive nature stems directly from their hierarchical form. 

Anarchism is a socio-economic and political theory, but not an ideology. The difference is '''very''' important. Basically, theory means you have ideas; an ideology means ideas have you. Anarchism is a body of ideas, but they are flexible, in a constant state of evolution and flux, and open to modification in light of new data. As society changes and develops, so does anarchism. An ideology, in contrast, is a set of &quot;fixed&quot; ideas which people believe dogmatically, usually ignoring reality or &quot;changing&quot; it so as to fit with the ideology, which is (by definition) correct. All such &quot;fixed&quot; ideas are the source of tyranny and contradiction, leading to attempts to make everyone fit onto a Procrustean Bed. This will be true regardless of the ideology in question - Leninism, Objectivism, &quot;Libertarianism,&quot; or whatever - all will all have the same effect: the destruction of real individuals in the name of a doctrine, a doctrine that usually serves the interest of some ruling elite. Or, as Michael Bakunin puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;Until now all human history has been only a perpetual and bloody immolation of millions of poor human beings in honour of some pitiless abstraction - God, country, power of state, national honour, historical rights, judicial rights, political liberty, public welfare.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;God and the State, Dover, New York, 1970. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dogmas are static and deathlike in their rigidity, often the work of some dead &quot;prophet,&quot; religious or secular, whose followers erect his or her ideas into an idol, immutable as stone. Anarchists want the living to bury the dead so that the living can get on with their lives. The living should rule the dead, not vice versa. Ideologies are the nemesis of critical thinking and consequently of freedom, providing a book of rules and &quot;answers&quot; which relieve us of the &quot;burden&quot; of thinking for ourselves. 

In producing this FAQ on anarchism it is not our intention to give you the &quot;correct&quot; answers or a new rule book. We will explain a bit about what anarchism has been in the past, but we will focus more on its modern forms and why '''we''' are anarchists today. The FAQ is an attempt to provoke thought and analysis on your part. If you are looking for a new ideology, then sorry, anarchism is not for you. 

While anarchists try to be realistic and practical, we are not &quot;reasonable&quot; people. &quot;Reasonable&quot; people uncritically accept what the &quot;experts&quot; and &quot;authorities&quot; tell them is true, and so they will always remain slaves! Anarchists know that, as Bakunin wrote: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;[a] person is strong only when he stands upon his own truth, when he speaks and acts from his deepest convictions. Then, whatever the situation he may be in, he always knows what he must say and do. He may fall, but he cannot bring shame upon himself or his causes.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Meltzer, Albert, I Couldn't Paint Golden Angels, AK Press, Edinburgh, 1996. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What Bakunin describes is the power of independent thought, which is the power of freedom. We encourage you not to be &quot;reasonable,&quot; not to accept what others tell you, but to think and act for yourself! 

One last point: to state the obvious, this is ''not'' the final word on anarchism. Many anarchists will disagree with much that is written here, but this is to be expected when people think for themselves. All we wish to do is indicate the ''basic'' ideas of anarchism and give our analysis of certain topics based on how we understand and apply these ideas. We are sure, however, that all anarchists will agree with the core ideas we present, even if they may disagree with our application of them here and there.

==Hello==
Hi this message should be seen as more or less spam.  I have been trying to revive the [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Mathematics]] page in an attempt to improve some of the mathematics here, so far I think I am the only person who knows this page exists.  Anyways, Calculus is the book I decided should sort of be a first priority for a collaborative project a few months back, and I am glad to see the work you've been doing on it.  (I have been rather distracted by the Linear Algebra book, on which 90% of the TeX would fail to render, but I am almost finished cleaning that up now.)  If there is any way I can be helpful, don't hesitate to ask.  

Despites my complaints otherwise, having a user page is a prerequisite for getting editor privileges.  Wikibooks is using this extension to the software called flagged revisions, which allows it to show only the most recent flagged revision, but not the most recent revision.  This is considered good because if someone comes by and vandalizes a page, the vandalism would not be shown to the public.  The flip side of the coin is that if someone like yourself comes along and improves the Differentiation page of the calculus book, then it doesn't get shown until someone comes along and &quot;sights&quot; it.  Which most of the time can take a long time.  On the other hand most pages have never had a revision flagged, in which case the software shows the latest revision.  When you get autopromoted to an editor, then you may set which revision is flagged yourself, and if you edit the latest revision of something, and that revision is flagged, then the new revision automatically gets flagged.  So that is a very long winded comment about why someone may want a user page.

Lastly, do you know a Geometric group theorist by the name of Margalit? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 09:41, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Existence of Solutions==

Just like with separable equations, not all initial value problems for linear equations have a solution.

:'''Theorem 1''': If P(''x'') and Q(''x'') are continuous on an interval I containing the point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, then the initial value problem has a single unique solution.

This is different from separable equations where the conditions for uniqueness and existence are different - with linear equations, if it exists, it will be unique.

'''Proof'''
We will use the method of successive approximations just as we did before.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Not to be confused with homogeneous equations, an equation homogeneous in x and y of degree n is an equation of the form

F(x,y,y')=0

Such that

&lt;math&gt;a^nF(x,y,y')=F(ax,ay,y')&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the equation can take the form

&lt;math&gt;x^nF(1,\frac{y}{x},y')=0&lt;/math&gt;

Which is essentially another in the form

&lt;math&gt;x^nF(\frac{y}{x},y')=0&lt;/math&gt;.

If we can solve this equation for y', then we can easily use the substitution method mentioned earlier to solve this equation. Suppose, however, that it is more easily solved for &lt;math&gt;\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{y}{x}=f(y')&lt;/math&gt;

So that

&lt;math&gt;y=xf(y')&lt;/math&gt;.

We can differentiate this to get

y'=f(y')+xf'(y')y''

Then re-arranging things,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{x}=\frac{f'(y')}{y'-f(y')}dy'&lt;/math&gt;

So that upon integrating,

&lt;math&gt;ln(x)=\int \frac{f'(y')}{y'-f(y')}dy'+C&lt;/math&gt;

We get

&lt;math&gt;x=Ce^{\int \frac{f'(y')}{y'-f(y')}dy'}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, if we can eliminate y' between two simultaneous equations 

&lt;math&gt;y=xf(y')&lt;/math&gt;

and 

&lt;math&gt;x=Ce^{\int \frac{f'(y')}{y'-f(y')}dy'}&lt;/math&gt;,

then we can obtain the general solution..

==Homogeneous Ordinary Differential Equations==

A function P is homogeneous of order &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;a^\alpha P(x,y)=P(ax,ay)&lt;/math&gt;. A homogeneous ordinary differential equation is an equation of the form P(x,y)dx+Q(x,y)dy=0 where P and Q are homogeneous of the same order.

The first usage of the following method for solving homogeneous ordinary differential equations was by Leibniz in 1691. Using the substitution y=vx or x=vy, we can make turn the equation into a separable equation.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=F \left (\frac{y}{x} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v(x,y)=\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y=vx \,&lt;/math&gt;

Now we need to find ''v''&amp;#39;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=v+\frac{dv}{dx}x&lt;/math&gt;

Plug back into the original equation

:&lt;math&gt;v+x\frac{dv}{dx}=F(v)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}=\frac{F(v)-v}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

:Solve for v(x), then plug into the equation of v to get y

:&lt;math&gt;y(x)=xv(x) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Again, don't memorize the equation.  Remember the general method, and apply it.

=== Example 2 ===

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=5\frac{y}{x}+3\frac{x}{y}&lt;/math&gt;

Let's use &lt;math&gt;v=\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;.  Solve for ''y''&amp;#39;(''x,v,v''&amp;#39;)

:&lt;math&gt;y=vx \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=v+x\frac{dv}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

Now plug into the original equation

:&lt;math&gt;v+x\frac{dv}{dx}=5v+\frac{3}{v}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x\frac{dv}{dx}=4v+\frac{3}{v}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v\frac{dv}{dx}=\frac{(4v^2+3)}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

Solve for ''v''

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{vdv}{4v^2+3}=\frac{dx}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{vdv}{4v^2+3}=\int \frac{dx}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{8}\ln(4v^2+3)=\ln(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;4v^2+3=e^{8 \ln(x)} \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;4v^2+3=e^{\ln(x^8)} \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;4v^2+3=x^8 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v^2=\frac{x^8-3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

Plug into the definition of ''v'' to get ''y''.

:&lt;math&gt;y=vx \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y^2=v^2x^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y^2=\frac{x^{10}-3x^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

We leave it in &lt;math&gt;y^2&lt;/math&gt; form, since solving for ''y'' would lose information.

Note that there should be a constant of integration in the general solution.  Adding it is left as an exercise.

=== Example 3 ===

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{x}{\sin(\frac{y}{x})}+\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

Lets use &lt;math&gt;v=\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt; again.  Solve for &lt;math&gt;y'(x,v,v')&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y=vx \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=v+x\frac{dv}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

Now plug into the original equation

:&lt;math&gt;v+x\frac{dv}{dx}=\frac{x}{\sin(v)}+v&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x\frac{dv}{dx}=\frac{x}{\sin(v)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin(v)dv=dx&lt;/math&gt;

Solve for ''v'':

:&lt;math&gt;\int \sin(v)dv=\int dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-\cos v=x+C \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v=\arccos(-x+C) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Use the definition of ''v'' to solve for ''y''.

:&lt;math&gt;y=vx \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y=\arccos(-x+C)x \,&lt;/math&gt;

=== An equation that is a function of a quotient of linear expressions ===

Given the equation &lt;math&gt;dy+f(\frac{a_1x+b_1y+c_1}{a_2x+b_2y+c_2})dx=0&lt;/math&gt;,

We can make the substitution x=x'+h and y=y'+k where h and k satisfy the system of linear equations:

&lt;math&gt;a_1h+b_1k+c_1=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;a_2h+b_2k+c_2=0&lt;/math&gt;

Which turns it into a homogeneous equation of degree 0:

&lt;math&gt;dy+f(\frac{a_1x'+b_1y'}{a_2x'+b_2y'})dx=0&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">d'Alembert's Equation, which is sometimes called the Lagrange equation was solved by John Bernoulli before 1694, and d'Alembert studied its singular solutions in a 1748 publication. It is essentially an equation of the form

y=xf(y')+g(y')

Where f and g are functions of y'.

Take the derivative

y'=f(y')+(xf'(y')+g'(y'))y&quot;

Now write this equation as

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dy'}-\frac{f'(y')}{y'-f(y')}x=\frac{g'(y')}{y'-f'(y')}&lt;/math&gt;

There are many types of &quot;perforated prototyping board&quot;.

The vast majority of such boards are perforated at 10 holes per inch both horizontally and vertically (also called &quot;tenth inch spacing&quot;), made out of either &quot;synthetic resin bonded paper&quot; or fiberglass, and have some kind of copper pattern on one or both sides of the board.

Perhaps the most popular pattern is &quot;stripboard&quot; -- which has wide strips of copper running one way all the way along one side of the board, but no copper on the other side.

Let X be a '''totally ordered set''' with ordering &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider all subsets of X of the form

&lt;math&gt;{x\in X|x&lt;a}&lt;/math&gt;

and 

&lt;math&gt;{x\in X|x&gt;a}&lt;/math&gt;

where a is any element of X. We call these the ''open rays'' of X. Since the union of all open rays is X, this is a '''semibase''' of some topology in this set.

We define the '''order topology''' of this ordered set to be the topology &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; that is generated by this semibase.

We define the ''open intervals'' in this set to be all sets of the form

&lt;math&gt;{x\in X|a&lt;x&lt;b}&lt;/math&gt;.

A base of this topology is the set of all open rays and open intervals. This is because the set of all open rays and open intervals together is the set of all finite intersections of the semibase of open rays.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Algebraic topology is the branch of topology where algebraic methods are used to solve topological problems. First, let's recall the fundamental problem of topology; given topological spaces &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, to determine whether they are homeomorphic. Recall that two spaces are homeomorphic if and only if there exists a homeomorphism, that is, an open continuous bijection, between them. Thus, to conclude that two spaces are not homeomorphic, we need to go through each and every continuous map btween them and check that it is not a homeomorphism! In general, this is impossible. Thus we need methods to deal with this problem. Algebraic topology makes some progress along these lines by assigning so-called ''algebraic invariants'' to topological spaces, in such a way that homeomorphic spaces have isomorphic invariants. Conversely, that means that if two spaces have different algebraic invariants, then they cannot be homeomorphic! Checking whether two algebraic structures are isomorphic or not in in general much easier than the original problem of homeomorphism, so this is a huge step forward.

Over the years, a multitude of different algebraic invariants have been developed. Whenever one designs or implements an invariant, it is important to have a good balance of computability versus completeness. We need to be able to compute the invariant invariant, and it must be &quot;fine&quot; enough to distinguish the properties we want to check. There is a fine line between vacuous computability and non-computable information! An invariant which achieves a good balance are the ''homotopy groups'' of a space, so we will start here. The homotopy groups are an infinite sequence &lt;math&gt;\pi_0(X), \pi_1(X), \pi_2(X),...&lt;/math&gt; of groups assigned to a space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. In this chapter, we will only concern ourselves with the first two groups, namely &lt;math&gt;\pi_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(X)&lt;/math&gt;, as these are the easiest to compute. We will come back to the rest of the sequence in a while.

==Paths and Loops==
We have worked with the concept of paths before in the concepts of path connectedness and local path connectedness. Here, we will review them again, and then define some new terms.

===Paths===
'''Definition:''' We denote by &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; the unit interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; equipped with the subspace topology with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition:''' A '''path''' from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in a space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function from &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(0)=x&lt;/math&gt; and such that &lt;math&gt;f(1)=y&lt;/math&gt;.

===Loops===
'''Definition:'''  Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space and &lt;math&gt;a\in X&lt;/math&gt;. One says that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a loop with base &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is path from a to a.

==Definition==
Let X and Y be topological spaces, and let f(x) and g(x) be continuous functions from X to Y. A homotopy between f and g is a continuous function h(x,r) from the set X×[0,1] to Y, such that h(x,0)=f(x), and such that h(x,1)=g(x).

Intuitively, we can think of a homotopy between two functions as a kind of continuous mapping between the two functions.

One can easily verify that homotopy is an equivalence relation both on paths and loops.

Homotopy of loops:&lt;br /&gt;
We can define two loops to be homotopic, when we consider a homotopy through loops, i. e. a homotopy h(x,r) between the two loops such that h(x,0)=h(x,1) for all x.

Note: If &lt;math&gt;X=\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; then all loops with base &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; are homotopic. We just have to take
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;F(t,s)=(1-s)\alpha(t)+s\beta(t).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In this section, you are going to learn a variety of ways to make menus with motions. These menus can be used in more ways than the simple pop-Up menus, such as in-game if you need to select something you can use this to bring up a menu smoothly. In this section there is heavy use of Properties, &quot;Property&quot; Logic Blocks, and especially IPO usage. When you do it once, it will be very much easier to do it again.

== Making Moving Selectors==
To kick this tutorial off, let's just do a simple icon that will be next to the selected menu item. There will be 6 possible menu items, which can be controlled with both the arrow keys and the mouse. Let's begin by booting up Blender, and deleting everything--then adding a camera.&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Clear_Blender.jpg|300px]]&lt;br&gt;
Set this camera to orthographic. Now I like making things look nice, but here are the basics of what you will need for this tutorial:
* Make 6 Planes, all different objects, and put them in a vertical list.
* Make a circle next to the first plane. This will act as the Selector.

So after you've made you objects, it should look similar to this:&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Blender basic menu.jpg|300px]]&lt;br&gt;

For me, I made mine look more like this, a little more detailed:&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Blender Graphic Menu.jpg|300px]]&lt;br&gt;

So now that we have our menu set up, it's time to set up the properties that will tell the selector how to move. Select the selector that will be moving and give it a property name &quot;Selection&quot;. Make it &quot;Int&quot; type, and start it out at &quot;1&quot;. To get this selector to move the way we want it, we have to set up its movements. Make sure you are on frame 1, and put the cursor on the first menu item, then Insert Keyframe for &quot;Loc&quot;. Next, move to frame 2, and put the cursor on the second menu item, then insert &quot;Loc&quot; Keyframe, and continue in this fashion for all your menu items. To get this applied in the Game Engine, in the logic bricks, add an &quot;Always&quot; Sensor (True Pulse Enabled), connected to an &quot;AND&quot; connector, and connected to a &quot;IPO&quot; Actuator, set to &quot;Property&quot; with Prop:Selection. Now we can do 3 things with this selector to have it move like a selector in a video game:&lt;br&gt;

'''Up/Down Arrow Keys'''&lt;br&gt;
To make the up and down arrow keys work properly, Select the Selector and add four sensors, controllers, and actuators. Make two sensors keyboard, with one set to &quot;Uparrow&quot; and one set to &quot;Downarrow&quot; (do not activate pulse triggering). Make the other two sensors Property Sensors, with True Pulse. For the first, make it &quot;Equal&quot;, Prop:Selection, Value:0. For the other, make it &quot;Equal&quot;, Prop:Selection, Value:7. For the Actuators, make all four &quot;Property&quot; sensors. For two of them, make them &quot;Add&quot;, Prop:Selection, and make the first &quot;Value:-1&quot; and the second &quot;Value:1&quot;. The other two should be &quot;Assign&quot;, Prop:Selection, with the first at &quot;Value:1&quot; and the next as &quot;Value:6&quot;. Now connect them as follows:&lt;br&gt;
'''''Click To Enlarge Image'''''&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Menu icon selector1.jpg|450px]]&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Keyboard:Uparrow&quot;--&quot;AND&quot;--&quot;Prop:Selection/Add/Value:-1&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Keyboard:Downarrow&quot;--&quot;AND&quot;--&quot;Prop:Selection/Add/Value:1&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Prop:Selection/Equal/7&quot;--&quot;AND&quot;--&quot;Prop:Selection/Assign/Value:1&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Prop:Selection/Equal/0&quot;--&quot;AND&quot;--&quot;Prop:Selection/Assign/Value:6&quot;&lt;br&gt;

Now you can play your game, and the arrow keys should work just fine!&lt;br&gt;

'''HotKeys'''&lt;br&gt;
If you don't know what a HotKey, it's a way to access menu items or action by pressing a specified letter, instead of just clicking or arrow keys. This method will require a different step when you make your UV text textures, as you will need to somehow change one letter (either the color or possibly underline) to let people know that that is a HotKey action.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The HotKey system is easy to set up right alongside the IPO/Selection property. In each menu item, highlight or make special one unique letter in each menu item. Then, with the selector selected, set up 6 keyboard logic sensors, each one for a different letter. Add 6 controllers, and 6 actuators as well. Make all the actuators &quot;Property&quot;, &quot;Assign, Prop:Selection, starting with Value:1 progressing to Value:6&quot;&lt;br&gt;

'''Mouse Selection'''&lt;br&gt;
Our final selection method we can add is the mouse scroll over. Set up the Mouse Sensor to Scroll Over for all 6 invisible selection planes. Then, make the AND Controllers and connect to your original set of &quot;Set Property&quot; Actuators. that matches the Object's IPO property number. It's fairly simple.&lt;br&gt;

'''Make the Selection'''&lt;br&gt;
The final thing to do is, once the selections are set up, make another 8 sensors, 7 controllers, 6 and actuators. Now make the 7th one a keyboard sensor for the ENTER key, as most people usually think they can start a game by pressing ENTER. The 8th Sensor is for another Mouse Sensor for &quot;Left Click&quot; so that if any of them is highlighted and you Left-Click the mouse, then it will be equivalent to pressing the ENTER key. That may be confusing as, unless you set up the dozen extra sensors, controllers, and actuators, you don't need to scroll over the selection to pick it, so that 8th sensor is your choice whether you want to add it. Connect the 7th and 8th sensor to the 7th controller. If you have the 8th sensor, make it an OR controller; otherwise, make the controller AND. As for the first 6 sensors, they should be Property Sensors for &quot;Prop:Selection&quot; &quot;Value:[1-6]&quot;. Connect each to their own separate controller. Now connect the 7th controller to all 6 Actuators, and the first 6 controllers connect to their own Actuator alongside the 7th. The Actuators can be whatever you want them to: whatever the selection causes to happen when you select the item selection.&lt;br&gt;

== Make the Menu Move ==
So we created a selection-based moving icon on a menu, but what might happen if you select that item and need a sub-menu in-game? You can't very well pause the game every time (unless it's a pause menu). This is where making the menu itself move comes in very handy. In this section, you will make an object clickable, and once clicked it will give out a submenu, which in itself will be able to give out a submenu.&lt;br&gt;

'''The IPOS'''&lt;br&gt;

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:04, 31 July 2008 (UTC)</text>

::[[Optimal Classification]] was originally published in the Wikipedia in May of 2007. It contained an unwikified primary reference that was wikified as an inline reference, along with several notes. It had two minor typo's, which were corrected and wiki graphic tables which made it larger than necessary. The graphics were converted to images and the size reduced. Currently references and notes are being expanded and text added to clarify the theoretical and empirical separatory equations. It is a work in progress.
::It was moved from the Wikipedia to the Wikibooks because Wikipedia user Jiuguang Wang read a Wikia article by the original author of the Wikipedia article which he rejected due to his being raised in Beijing as a Chinese Communist and as an atheist prior to moving to Atlanta in 2000 when he was 12. The Wikia article uses logic to both define, support and defend the existence of God.
::In line with his rejection of the Wikia article he rejected the [[Optimal Classification]] article as a hoax and nominated it for deletion on the Wikipedia. Proof that the article is not original research can be found by reading the primary reference while the notability of the subject can be verified by reading the references the primary reference contains. 
::I am contacting you because user Jiuguang Wang along with a Wikipedia administrator have now nominated the [[Optimal Classification]] ''book'' for deletion as a continuation of their harassment and personal attack against the Wikipedia author and since I have never been through a nomination for deletion experience I do not know how to post a vote to keep this book from being deleted. Your help is needed and will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 22:32, 31 July 2008 (UTC)

*{{keep}} Two points worth noting: First, a person's behavior on Wikipedia does not matter here at Wikibooks. When he comes here, he has a blank slate and is not to be punished for his behavior elsewhere. This is most true of Wikipedia, which is known to have a very tough and incompassionate system of justice. Second, transwiking from Wikipedia to Wikibooks ''might be the right thing to do'' since the two projects have very different inclusion criteria. The idea of classification, and the idea of an optimal classification scheme are not unique nor original. This topic is an important one in the field of computer science (and less important but still pertinant for other fields). Wikibook's notion of &quot;original research&quot; is different from that at WP, and I do not believe this book to be in violation of our policies. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:51, 31 July 2008 (UTC)

: Can you elaborate on WikiBooks' policy on original research? At the previous AfD, concerned were raised over the &quot;references&quot; provided in the article in that they do not actually provide references for the materials in the article. You are right - optimal classification is an important ''idea'', but the article here is about an algorithm the editor invented. The cited works (by Rypka) contains no mentions of an ''algorithm'' called optimal classification. As for the behavior - should I assume that calling another editor &quot;...Chinese Communist Beijing as an atheist&quot; do not constitute a personal attack here? --[[User:Jiuguang Wang|Jiuguang Wang]] ([[User talk:Jiuguang Wang|talk]]) 23:02, 31 July 2008 (UTC)

::If the editor has made a personal attack, we will deal with that elsewhere. It is not the purpose of VFD to examine behavior issues, and we will not make deletion decisions based on them.
::Wikibook's OR policy is far less restrictive then that at WP. We don't require references (although they are always appreciated), because books tend not to have them in the same way that Encyclopediae do. Books will have biblography, however, and we encourage that. We require that books be ''verifiable'', either through normal references/bibliography, common knowledge, or self reproduction. If a result can be reproduced faithfully by a reader, it satisfies our criteria. Because of the verifiability requirement, books tend to build from easy results which are obvious to results which are not. However, since books are works in progress, we can't expect new books to contain all the necessary scaffolding to support later results. Ideally, that scaffolding will be added eventually. Is this enough information for you? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:14, 31 July 2008 (UTC)
::: Yes, thank you. I would still like to know in what way this article is verifiable, though - the original editor would argue that it is verifiable by Rypka's work, except I cannot find anything online or in books that matches the statements and equations in the article (please provide a page number?) The work has also not been peer-reviewed elsewhere. --[[User:Jiuguang Wang|Jiuguang Wang]] ([[User talk:Jiuguang Wang|talk]]) 23:27, 31 July 2008 (UTC)
::::Okay, and we can take those kinds of criticisms into account later. All books have problems, new books especially so. We can't damn a book for being imperfect before it's even a week old (and not even then, usually). What this book needs is time to improve. If you've read relevant works in the area, are familiar with the subject, and are obviously taking the time to post comments here, maybe you would be interested in helping this book to grow correctly? Small books need all the help they can get. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:00, 1 August 2008 (UTC)
:::::What was &quot;''invented''&quot; by Dr. Rypka and his team, which included scientists from the former Soviet Union, were the theoretical and empirical separatory equations. The &quot;''algorithm''&quot; is merely the application of the equations to static or incoming dynamic data. The word &quot;''optimal''&quot; as explained in the text is used throughout Dr. Rypka's work to denote the ''type'' of classification along with the word &quot;''continuous''.&quot; Contrary to the statements of User:Jiuguang Wang, on page 161 of the Primary reference can be found a photocopy of the Burroughs 5700 Time Sharing Service Terminal printout and a full description of the algorithms which implement the separatory equations. Elucidating the equations by describing each of their variables is hardly original research. Rather it is the equivalent of paraphrasing the text of Dr. Rypka's work. You will have to obtain and read a copy of his publication to understand the reason for use of the word &quot;optimal&quot; in the name of the book's title since I do not have permission (''yet'') from the publisher to publish a photocopy of Dr. Rypka's work here or in the Wikipedia. What disturbs me most however is that [[User:Jiuguang Wang|Jiuguang Wang]] would nominate an article for deletion without reading the primary reference or the references it contains. It would be the equivalent of an anthropologist going into the jungle, seeing a skeleton he had never seen before and for that reason taking a mallet to it.

*{{keep}}, but revisit. He's only had just over 3 days to work on it, and textbook materials take a lot more time to develop than wikipedia articles (we also don't have the same sorts of notability requirements). If it ''is'' original research in the sense of an interpretation or extrapolation, it can be transwikied to Wikiversity for further development. I recommend closing the VfD for at least a few weeks to see what can be made of the text without undue pressure. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:54, 31 July 2008 (UTC)
*{{keep}}, as per SBJ.  It doesn't sit well with me that two people create accounts here apparently for the sole purpose of nominating a new book for a VfD and voting on it. I view such activity with a jaundiced eye.  I have a difficult time believing they intend to become a regular, constructive part of this community once this issue is resolved.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:10, 1 August 2008 (UTC)
* [[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' The background history to this over at Wikipedia is somewhat disturbing and doesn't really make anyone look particularly good. It seems like people are taking this very personally. I agree with Whiteknight, SB_Johnny and Jomegat. Let's close this for now and give it some time to develop. Perhaps this should eventually move to Wikiversity. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:07, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

== Splitting into smaller sub-pages ==
Why should this be split into smaller sub-pages? I don't find the length confusing in the least. On the contrary, keeping everything here allows for a quick overview. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 23:10, 31 July 2008 (UTC)
:I felt the same way since for one thing the application example has a tendency to immediately capture one's attention. One might otherwise keep on &quot;thumbing&quot;.

[[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 11:20, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

:I also don't see a need to split it into sub-pages at this time (the book is to recent and still very small in size).

:::One of the problem I find when contributing to a book even if its size is an impediment to a monolithic approach, is that if it is to segmented, there is no way to see all the structure, it becomes very hard to give the work any flow or sense of directionality and to reduce duplication of content.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:43, 4 August 2008 (UTC)

== Expand this ==

The theory of optimal classification is a large area of research.This book, however, only covers a single algorithm, like an article would. This book really needs to be expanded to include more information, like a book should. There are a lot of important topics like Bayes classification algorithm that aren't covered here. To help expand this book quickly, you can [[WB:RFI|request imports of related articles from Wikipedia]], and turn those into book pages. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:53, 31 July 2008 (UTC)
*What I had in mind was limiting it to algorithms and processes that perform the same function. Is that what you have in mind as well? [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 11:23, 1 August 2008 (UTC)
*Just tested method of hierarchal expansion similar to computer folder tree (Microsoft Windows) hierarchy with:
:&quot;''Optimal Classification/Application Example/Flag Recognition''&quot;. 
:The tree structure can easily accommodate expansion or contraction. 
:For instance, if one assumes ''Optimal Classification'' to be at &quot;book&quot; level then a &quot;'''chapter'''&quot; level for each method of Optimal Classification can be inserted into the hierarchy as follows: 
:''Optimal Classification/'''Chapter 1'''/Application Example/Flag Recognition''. 
:Revisions of the tree will require that links be updated manually or perhaps by bot.
:[[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 14:47, 1 August 2008 (UTC)
:: This is the benefit of the flat database structure of the wiki. Don't introduce a hierarchy except where absolutely needed. So, to indicate which pages are part of a book, you place them under &lt;Bookname&gt;/&lt;pagename&gt;. Where there is clear use in mutual back-links (such as is the case with [[Japanese/Vocabulary]]: there are links to this page just under the title on the sub-pages, e.g. [[Japanese/Vocabulary/Animals]]) pages can be place in deeper sub-pages. Otherwise, the structure of the book should be created simply by linking.
:: That allows for a more flexible system of interlinking and breaks us out of the confines of linear books. It also allows for reorganising of content such as moving a page between chapters simply by changing the link, rather than having to move the page as well. A page can even appear in the learning path more than once. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:46, 4 August 2008 (UTC)
:::So it sounds like you are saying that the tree structure is already automated here and to take advantage of its automation only requires use of a tag like object (&lt;bookname&gt;/&lt;pagename&gt;) at the head of the page? [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 07:37, 4 August 2008 (UTC)
:::: The back-links don't require any &quot;tags&quot; &amp;mdash; just a hierarchy. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 11:28, 7 August 2008 (UTC)
*Further testing indicates that a lot of work is required to manually fix the links when the hierarchy structure is changed. Although a tree structure is logically superior it may not be feasible without a bot to follow and make the changes.

:::No tags, it's only based on the location of the pages take a look into the [[C++ Programming]] notice that if you select TOC1 on the top of the window it shows &quot;&lt; C++ Programming&quot;, the order is given by the location of the page on the book namespace.

== Additional methods being sought to fill additional chapters... ==

Starting with [[w:Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Mathematics#list_methods_which_can_demonstrate_ability_to_perform_a_given_function| this]]  query at the Wikipedia mathematics reference desk.

Note: Due to the limitation of set size shown in the primary reference and the notation of a sub-scheme, the method of permutation was used in the evaluation program. It is assumed the need for a set size limit and a sub scheme was due to the limitation of the computational facility a the time (1971), namely a Burroughs 5700 time sharing terminal. Current PC technology is sufficient to accommodate a much larger set size before a sub-scheme for remaining characteristics that fall outside the limit of the set must be used. If a decision tree trimming method which can accomplish the same function without requiring a limit on set size or the need for a sub-scheme then it should be included here. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 13:42, 12 August 2008 (UTC)

== more general book ==

I think a discussion of classification algorithms, such as this algorithm, should stay at Wikibooks.
However, rather than put each algorithm in its own book, I think it would be better to collect several algorithms per book.
So I suggest moving this &quot;Optimal Classification&quot; &quot;book&quot;, to make it part of a more general book.

Which book is the appropriate place for this algorithm?
* [[Algorithm implementation]]?
* [[Artificial Intelligence]]?
* [[Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms]]?
* [[Systems Theory/Decision Structure]]?
* Start a new book that covers only classification and clustering algorithms?
* Some other book I've overlooked?

Which book do you feel is most appropriate for discussing this algorithm?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 15:56, 13 August 2008 (UTC)

:I agree with you, my preference goes to a work that &quot;covers only classification and clustering algorithms&quot;, but then why not let this evolve into a more complete book or just wait for someone else to create book on the same lines and propose a merge ? (for what I've understood the actual author only intended to cover this one algorithm, that gives us a usable book on a given subject, not the beginning of a great project, with luck and more contributions maybe it will get there).&lt;rb&gt;
:I take you aren't committing to help extend it, just advancing the proposal ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:34, 13 August 2008 (UTC)

::Although in need of improvement and expansion (still) I liked this &quot;book&quot; in the form of an article much better than in the form of a book. In the form of a book I agree that it makes a very thin, although very potent, book which has already been expanded about as much a possible without making it more complicated than it needs to be by covering every minute detail as in the primary reference. My goal after all in creating it online anywhere in the first place was to show its, 
::#universal application and 
::#practical simplicity in combination with its solid mathematical base.
::I feel therefore that perhaps a new book project which &quot;...covers only classification and clustering algorithms&quot; so as to show and compare the advantages, disadvantages and applications of each method (in which case Dr. Rypka's method might become only a section within a chapter covering optimal classification) with additional sections to cover other methods of optimal classification is acceptable but may also be highly beneficial and supportive of the understanding of Dr. Rypka's method as well.

== clustering ==

Hi David,

I noticed your clustering link at [[Optimal Classification]].

I had not previously read the Wikipedia [[w:Cluster analysis|cluster analysis]] article. 

Dr. Rypka refers to clustering on page 171, section 3(a) of the '''Primary reference'''&lt;ref&gt; Biological Identification with Computers edited by R.J. Pankhurst, British museum (natural history) London, England proceedings of a meeting held at Kings College, Cambridge 27 and 28 September 1973 of the Systematics Association Special Volume Number 7 and published by the Academic Press 1975 noting the work of Eugene W. Rypka, Dept. of Microbiology, Lovelace Center for Health Sciences, Albuquerque, New Mexico, &quot;Pattern Recognition and Microbial Identification.&quot;  ISBN 0125448503&lt;/ref&gt;. The &quot;number of clusters&quot; label on the graphic in the [[w:Cluster analysis#Elbow criterion|&quot;Elbow&quot; clustering]] paragraph corresponds directly to the &quot;number of attributes&quot; in the ''target set'' of Dr. Rypka's method.

While Dr. Rypka stopped at three attributes and thereafter incorporated a sub-scheme to complete the classification, presumably due to the computing limits imposed by his Burroughs (now UNISYS) 5700 TimeShare Terminal, it is easy, using the computing power of a modern PC, to optionally match the number of attributes in the target set with the number of attributes in the group or to stop computing when separation of the elements reaches 100%. The failure to find 100% separation within the group indicates the need for additional attributes to be incorporated into the group. However, since the process is dynamic and dependent upon attribute values, attributes which are included in the target set may still be necessary when values change.

Since Dr. Rypka's method employs the method of ''attribute value clustering'' as shown [[Optimal Classification/Rypka Method/Examples/Computational#Count multisets|here]], I wonder if the level of the book chapter or page hierarchy should be changed?

Coincidentally, I am very much aware of this clustering method having discovered and applied a [http://academia.wikia.com/wiki/Check_sort#Check_sort_and_Rapid_sort sort routine] which the clustering method serves to demonstrate perfectly.

===notes===

&lt;references/&gt;

A lot of people are tricked [http://communitywiki.org/BestPracticesForWikiTheoryBuilding] into thinking that book writers and newspaper journalists first come up with a title, then create an outline, then start filling in the information -- merely because that's the order they read in.

So I strongly recommend that people write down everything they know about a subject first.
After you can't think of anything else about the subject, then start organizing.
So ... yes, I agree that the book page hierarchy should be changed, someday.
But rather than put it into the &quot;final&quot; order, I much prefer putting the pages of the book into an &quot;easy to shuffle and reorganize&quot; order -- the &quot;flat page structure&quot; ([[WB:NP]]).

As I already said on [[Talk:Optimal Classification]], I think this algorithm needs to be placed into a more general book that includes more than just this one algorithm, but I haven't yet decided which one is best yet (or if we should start yet another book).

I am confused.
When you mention &quot;this clustering method&quot;, are you referring to Rypka's algorithm, or one of the other 10 algorithms listed at [[Optimal Classification/clustering] ?

When I talk about clustering, I use the term &quot;number of attributes&quot; to describe the amount of information attached to each element -- in my case, it's almost always &quot;3&quot; integers.
But I see that other people often work with far more information, and with textual tags rather than simple integers.

I use the term &quot;number of clusters&quot; to describe the number of different &quot;buckets&quot; that I use to sort the elements.
I toss each element into one and only one bucket.
I often use 256 buckets.

So you can see how I would be confused if someone told me that &quot;number of attributes&quot; and &quot;number of clusters&quot; are the same thing.
I suspect it's a terminology thing -- those terms mean something else to you.

You know what would help?
It would help if someone wrote a book about this subject. :-)

:I will have to look at the other &quot;clustering&quot; algorithms before I can comment further. Over the years I have studied many algorithms to learn about them and many of those algorithms may have changed and I have not looked at the changes. 
===Wikipedia Cluster analysis - [[w:Cluster analysis#Elbow criterion|&quot;''Elbow criterion''&quot;]] - obvious misinterpretation/original research ===
'''Theoretical and Empirical Separation Curves'''
:In the context we are discussing a '''''set''''' or '''''multiset''''' of values or states is called an '''''attribute''''' when it is used in combination with other attributes to define a bounded class of elements that have the same attributes in common. It appears that the point of confusion here is that you (and others) are using the term &quot;cluster&quot; to refer to a &quot;subset of a set&quot; or to a ''group'' of ''attributes'' which define a bounded class rather than using the term &quot;cluster&quot; to refer to the multiset count for each value or state of an ''attribute.'' In this context the set or multiset of values of an attribute will always have a number of clusters equal to the count of its values or states.

:The number of attributes selected to derive target set size of the subset is usually not fixed but initially set to one and thereafter incremented progressively until 100% separation is achieved or before the target set size exceeds computer capacity or the time allocated for classification is exceeded. The minimum number of attributes can be determined mathematically as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; t_{min} =  \frac{\log G}{\log V}&lt;/math&gt;, where:&lt;ref&gt;See page 157, ''Primary Schemes'' footnote of the '''primary reference'''&lt;/ref&gt;

::*'''''t&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is the minimal number of characteristics to result in theoretical separation,
::*'''''G''''' is the number of elements in the '''bounded''' class and
::*'''''V''''' is the highest value of logic in the group.

:My comments are indented below... [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 22:05, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

One of the difficult things about teaching is trying to describe some concept to a student without dragging in a bunch of other abstract concepts that the student hasn't learned yet.

I like the flags example. 
:Look at it again. Recall the statement under the [[Optimal_Classification/Rypka_Method/Examples/Application#Flag_overlay_grid|Flag overlay grid]]? The '''areas''' represent '''attributes''', the '''colors''' represent '''attribute''' '''values''' and the '''flags''' represent '''elements'''.  [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 18:50, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

An example for clustering:

I have a pile of rocks.
And I'm sorting them into some literal buckets.
:To sort you need first to separate. To separate you first need a '''''criteria''''' upon which to separate. The criteria in regard to rocks might be weight or size or color or shape. What criteria are you going to use to separate the rocks? [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 18:50, 10 September 2008 (UTC)
As you probably already know, any one rock can be put into at most one bucket. 
:Correct but irrelevant. The rock itself can not be split between two buckets without using a mallet or sledge hammer. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 18:50, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

Once I'm done, each bucket contains one cluster of rocks. 

:What makes these rocks a cluster? The weight or size or color or shape? Being in the same bucket without a criteria does not make them a cluster, like a &quot;cluster&quot; of stars in the heavens with no other criteria except proximity, i.e., you can't rationally say they are a cluster because they are close together in the bucket. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 18:50, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

I suppose you could call that cluster &quot;a subset of a set or ''group'' of ''attributes'' which define a bounded class&quot;.
Forgive me for thinking that is [http://communitywiki.org/PlainTalkDrama unnecessarily confusing].

:No. It is improper to use the term '''''cluster''''' in this way. The word '''''set''''' is a generalized term but the word '''''cluster''''' is not. Think about the flag above. A flag is made up of different colors in different locations but a flag is not properly defined as a cluster of colors. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 18:50, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

Another example for clustering:

I'm drawing a map.
I want to use 3 colors for &quot;forest&quot;, &quot;plains&quot;, and &quot;houses/roads&quot;,
and I draw a thin black line between each of those colors.
But the photograph I'm using for a reference has jillions of tiny little spots, one for each tree.

I draw a loop around each &quot;forest&quot;, and fill in with with the dark green &quot;forest&quot; color.

In several places there's a flat path that winds through an area that is dense with trees on both sides of the path.
In some of those places, I say there is 2 different forests bordering that path -- I draw 2 loops of black line, and the path between those loops has the &quot;plains&quot; color.
Other times I call it one big forest -- I draw one big loop of back line, and points on that path have the &quot;forest&quot; color.

After I'm done, each forest is a cluster of trees.

:Okay, I believe I see the problem. You are deriving the meaning of the word '''''cluster''''' from its colloquial uses. Another example would be an oak leaf cluster.
:Also, you are using &quot;forest&quot;, &quot;plains&quot;, and &quot;houses/roads&quot; as if they were '''''attributes''''' when in fact they are  '''''elements''''' in your '''bounded''' class. (See [[w:Attribute-value system|attribute-valued system]].) [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 18:50, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

Even though I only know 2 attributes about each tree (its x and y location on the photograph),
I may draw dozens of small forests on this map.
:You are describing &quot;trees&quot; here as if they are elements but using them above as if they are attributes.  [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 18:50, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

This kind of spacial clustering is hard-wired in the human eye/brain.
But just because humans can quickly draw loops around each forest doesn't make it easy to program a computer to do it.

In particular, counting &quot;how many forests are in this photograph?&quot; is surprisingly difficult for current computer algorithms, given how quickly and easily humans can do it &quot;without giving it much thought&quot;.

Okay, I have inserted comments above instead of placing them down here to help eliminate confusion but I need to eat super before concluding.
Please review the attribute-value systems Wikipedia article linked to above and I will return as soon as possible. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 18:50, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

A brief look at the list of [[Optimal Classification/clustering|clustering algorithms]] tends to convince me now that most do not belong here,i.e., clustering and classification are two different things of which clustering is but one step in the process of classification just as it is but one step in the process of executing an artificial neural network and just as it appears to be but one step in the other examples of what are called clustering algorithms in the above list. Putting it here would be a bit like a page or a chapter about multiplication being put in a book about linear programming. Sure, linear programming relies upon multiplication but so do many other techniques and methodologies. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 22:01, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /br&gt;

: Dear fellow Wikibookian,

: I see that what I've been doing is actually [[w:vector quantization|vector quantization]].
: So we shouldn't be surprised that what I am doing is technically not exactly the same thing as &quot;classification&quot;.

: I've been asked ''To separate you first need a '''''criteria''''' upon which to separate. ... What criteria are you going to use to separate the rocks? What makes these rocks a cluster? The weight or size or color or shape?''

: I don't know ahead of time which criteria I will use.

: I have a bunch of rocks. (I actually work with other things, but I don't want to bring in a bunch of irrelevant details, so let's pretend I'm working with rocks).
: For each one, I measure its density and hardness.
: I suppose I *could* decide, before looking at any rocks (top-down), exactly which range of density and hardness to assign to each bucket.
: However, many times I do something more like spread them across the ground in a density-vs-hardness graph.
: In an ideal world, there would be a few discrete points in the density-vs-hardness graph (&quot;sandstone&quot;, &quot;granite&quot;, &quot;salt&quot;), and every rock would fall exactly on top of one of those points, making a tower.
: And in that ideal world, it would be easy to discover exactly how many kinds of rocks I have, *after* I have already divided up all the rocks into a few discrete towers (bottom-up), by counting how many towers I see.
: Alas, because of my own measurement error, and also because of variations in the rocks, very rarely do 2 rocks fall at exactly the same point in this graph.
: Still, I can usually visually pick out one group of closely spaced rocks, call them all &quot;Type 1&quot; and put them into bucket #1, and pick out another group of closely spaced rocks (far away form the first group), call them &quot;Type 2&quot;, put them into bucket #2, etc.

: Now it may turn out that *all* of tomorrow's rocks have the same hardness, and my criteria ends up being density alone.
: Or it may turn out that *all* of tomorrow's rocks have the same density, and my criteria ends up being hardness alone.
: Or it may turn out that *all* of tomorrow's rocks fall along a diagonal line, and *either* density alone *or* hardness alone is sufficient to separate the piles I discover.
: Or it may turn out that they end up in one tight pile, and I may decide to use color or shape or some other measurement to divide them.
: But I won't know until I try it.

: I don't know ahead of time which criteria I will use.
: Tomorrow, *after* I divide up all the rocks, *then* I could give you some criteria -- a range of hardness and density (or something else) that describes the rocks in each bucket.

: Let me say again -- what I'm actually doing in this example is vector quantization.
: The reason I'm bringing up vector quantization is that I think that the &quot;Optimal Classification&quot; algorithm *should* go into some book at Wikibooks. However, I think a book that discussed that algorithm *and* other closely-related algorithms would be *better* than a book about a single algorithm.
: And &quot;vector quantization&quot; is the most closely related algorithm that I am familiar with.
: I suspect other algorithms have been developed that are even more closely related -- the book should talk about those as well.
: If we discover that there are 100 other algorithms that are even more closely related to &quot;Optimal Classification&quot; than &quot;vector quantization&quot;, then I would agree that &quot;vector quantization&quot; doesn't belong in this book -- we would put the most-closely-related algorithms in this book, and put the other algorithms (and vector quantization) in some other book or books.

: I agree that &quot;vector quantization&quot; and &quot;optimal classification&quot; are &quot;two different things&quot;.
: But how can a book discuss several algorithms unless those algorithms are different?

: If X is the first step in the process of doing Y, then I think a Wikibook about Y should *either* also cover X, *or* have a link to some other prerequisite book. (For example, [[Microprocessor Design]] points out that [[Digital Circuits]] is a prerequisite).
: So would you prefer me to keep talking about clustering and classification and &quot;vector quantization&quot; in this book? Or are you going to point out a more appropriate prerequisite book?

Okay, lets see. First it might help if you understand that you don't have to know what label you are going to put on a bucket because the first rock to go into any bucket will do that for you. its really that simple. Of course you have to decide thereafter 1.) what criteria the next rock you pick up embodies and 2.) if a bucket already contains a rock with the same criteria or if you have to recruit another bucket. [http://academia.wikia.com/wiki/Check_sort This] might help.

How about other types of classification besides optimal? For instance, how about a chapter on temporal classification such as is used to create a family tree or a biological taxonomy that has a hierarchy which is not optimal but based on sequence of events? A chapter I think would be really great would be on the classification used in soil taxonomy. In fact I'm working on a way to classify soil using optimal classification instead of the method used to classify soil so it would be really helpful to have such a chapter. Lots of things just do not fit the optimal classification scheme. There could also be chapters on how create a classification table, that is, how to select elements, attributes and values or one on how to find applications. There could be a chapter on examples and a chapter on the whole theory behind classification and why do it and what advantage it offers. That way the book won't be entitled Optimal Classification but rather Classification with Optimal Classification as a chapter just like the other types of classification or topics about classification will have their own chapter.  [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 23:04, 11 September 2008 (UTC)

: Yes. I agree that it would be good to open this book up to all kinds of classification algorithms and related techniques. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 23:11, 3 October 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Linear Equations and Linear Operators ==

A general linear equation is of the form

&lt;math&gt;P_0(x)y^{(n)}+P_1(x)y^{(n-1)}+...+P_ny=Q(x)&lt;/math&gt;,

where we will assume that the coefficient functions &lt;math&gt;P_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; and Q(x) are continuous functions in an interval [a,b], and that &lt;math&gt;P_0(x)\neq0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in [a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. The existence theorem proves that a unique solution exists that passes through the point &lt;math&gt;(x_0,y_0)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x\in [a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, with continuous derivatives up to the n-1 order, and satisfies initial conditions for each of those derivatives at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.

One can also write this as

&lt;math&gt;L(y)=(P_0\frac{d^n}{dx^n}+P_1\frac{d^{n-1}}{dx^{n-1}}+...+P_n)y=Q(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where L is called a '''linear differential operator''' of order n.

A differential equation of the form L(y)=0 with the same linear differential operator as above is called a ''homogeneous equation'' corresponding to the above equation, and the ''reduced equation'' of the above equation.

We will now prove some properties about the linear differential operator.

The linear differential operator:

&lt;math&gt;L(C_1y_1+C_2y_2)=C_1L(y_1)+C_2L(y_2)&lt;/math&gt; which is true because differentiation is linear. Thus, we can make the two following statements:

*If &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; are two solutions of the homogeneous equation, then &lt;math&gt;C_1y_1+C_2y_2&lt;/math&gt; is also a solution.
*If y is a solution to the homogeneous equation L(y)=0, and &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; is a solution to the equation L(y)=Q(x), then &lt;math&gt;y+y_0&lt;/math&gt; is also a solution to the equation L(y)=Q(x).

==Wronskian==

Let L(y)=0 be a homogeneous equation of degree n, and let &lt;math&gt;y_1,y_2,...,y_n&lt;/math&gt; be linearly independent solutions of this equation.

The general solution is then &lt;math&gt;y=C_1y_1+C_2y_2+...+C_ny_n&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose instead that the solutions are not linearly independent. Then there exists values for &lt;math&gt;C_1,C_2,...,C_n&lt;/math&gt; not all zero such that &lt;math&gt;C_1y_1+C_2y_2+...+C_ny_n&lt;/math&gt;=0.

Then the following equations also hold true:

&lt;math&gt;C_1y_1'+C_2y_2'+...+C_ny_n'=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;C_1y_1''+C_2y_2''+...+C_ny_n''=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;C_1y_1^{(n-1)}+C_2y_2^{(n-1)}+...+C_ny_n^{(n-1)}=0&lt;/math&gt;

When there is to be a non-trivial solution to this system of homogeneous linear equations, the column vectors corresponding to each coefficient are linearly dependent. This is equivalent to saying that the following determinant, called the '''Wronskian''' is 0:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{Vmatrix}
y_1 &amp; y_2 &amp; ... &amp; y_n \\
y_1' &amp; y_2' &amp; ... &amp; y_n' \\
y_1'' &amp; y_2'' &amp; ... &amp; y_n'' \\
... &amp; ... &amp; ... &amp; ... \\
y_1^{(n-1)} &amp; y_2^{(n-1)} &amp; ... &amp; y_n^{(n-1)} \\
\end{Vmatrix} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, if the solutions are dependent, then their Wronskian is equal to 0, and conversely, and conversely if the Wronskian is equal to 0, then the columns of that matrix must be linearly dependent, indicating that the solutions are linearly dependent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fields are very important to the study of linear algebra. This is because any result in linear algebra applies to all fields, because the basic operations in linear algebra involve only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

However, they are primarily the study of [[Abstract Algebra]] and will not fully be treated here. Instead, we provide only the definition.

A '''field''' is a set F with two binary operators (or functions) + and * and with elements 0 and 1 such that:
*Commutativity of addition: a+b=b+a
*Associativity of addition: (a+b)+c=a+(b+c)
*Additive identity: 0+a=a+0=a
*Additive inverse: There exists an element b such for all a such that a+b=0
*Commutativity of multiplication: ab=ba
*Associativity of multiplication: (ab)c=a(bc)
*Multiplicative identity: 1a=a1=a
*Multiplicative inverse: There exists an element b for all nonzero a such that ab=1
*Distributivity of multiplication over addition: a(b+c)=ab+ac

Examples of fields:
#The rational numbers Q
#The real numbers R
#The complex numbers C
#The set of rational polynomial functions

===Characteristic 0===
Another important assumption for linear algebra is that we are working with a field of characteristic 0.

==Definition==
The ''characteristic'' of a field is the first natural number n such that 1+1+1+...+1 (n times) is equal to 0. If there is no such number, then it is of characteristic 0.

Example:
#The integers modulo p, Z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; where p is a prime number.

In linear algebra, we do not work with such fields as Z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, so we will only work with fields of characteristic 0.

== Allotones? ==

I just have an issue with the tones being listed as allophones, is this correct, wouldn't they be allotones or something? because to me an allophone is a phoneme not a toneme, but I could be wrong, comments?[[User:Ave matthew|Ave matthew]] ([[User talk:Ave matthew|talk]]) 00:28, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

: It's my understanding that ''allotone'' is a sometimes-used term for a kind of allophone, and ''toneme'' is a sometimes-used term for a kind of phoneme; which would make the usage here correct.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 18:52, 3 January 2010 (UTC)

== Completion stage ==

Imho, the one significant outstanding issue with this section is the dependence of the sounds on regional accent.  I don't seem to pronounce ''complexity'' quite as depicted; and the examples of words illustrating vowel sounds are more problematic since in my accent some of them illustrate different vowel sounds that they're used for here.  A ymmv note would cover ''complexity'', but the illustrations not illustrating is more awkward.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 07:08, 24 December 2013 (UTC)</text>

The &lt;code&gt;kanji&lt;/code&gt; variable will try to use the ''order'', ''red'' or ''bw'' image types (in that order) for the character from the [[commons:Commons:Stroke Order Project|Commons:Stroke Order Project]]. If none of these exists, it falls back on a large font. The image can also be explicitly declared with the &lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; variable.

The &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; determines the width of both the character image and of the table element in which it sits. The meaning is passed to &lt;code&gt;meaning&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;onyomi&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;kunyomi&lt;/code&gt; are the readings, &lt;code&gt;onrei&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;kunrei&lt;/code&gt; are the examples for these readings (as in: 音例 and 訓例). The &lt;code&gt;nanori&lt;/code&gt; (名乗り) are irregular readings used almost exclusively in Japanese names. The &lt;code&gt;special&lt;/code&gt; are special readings that are not considered onyomi, kunyomi or nanori. Examples of these readings are given with &lt;code&gt;specialre&lt;/code&gt;.

'''Note:''' The reading examples should be in bulleted form. The bullets '''must''' be put at the start of a line for them to be formatted properly.

A pumapard is a hybrid of a female puma and a male leopard or a female leopard and a male puma. Both of these pairings have been known to have babies. In general, these hybrids have a short stature and are smaller than their parents.

==Appearance==
Pumapards tend to be smaller than their parents. The ones who were reported grew to only half the size of their parents. They have a Puma-like long body and they also have short legs. Their coat is described as yellowish brown or greyish with brown imitations of forms of roses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Just wanted to say great &quot;living&quot; book so far.  You've covered most of the 640-821 test with this information, and its a great way to study while at work, in between actual work.

I just wanted to clear up a little confusion about the UDP section.  The whole part on UDP says:
The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core protocols of the Internet protocol suite. Using UDP, programs on networked computers can send short messages sometimes known as datagrams to one another. UDP is sometimes called the Universal Datagram Protocol or Unreliable Datagram Protocol.

UDP does not provide the reliability and ordering that TCP does. Datagrams may arrive out of order, appear duplicated, or go missing without notice. Without the overhead of checking whether every packet actually arrived, UDP is faster and more efficient for many lightweight or time-sensitive purposes. Also, its stateless nature is useful for servers that answer small queries from huge numbers of clients. Compared to TCP, UDP is required for Broadcasting (send to all on local network) and multicast (send to all subscribers).

Common network applications that use UDP include the Domain Name System (DNS), streaming media applications such as IPTV, Voice over IP (VoIP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) and online games.

------------

That last part  explains applications of UDP is VoIP... Now I won't argue that VoIP isn't using UDP, but its not exactely UDP that does the real portion of it, its really Real-Time Transfer Protocol.  I would put a little bit of information in there about that, just to make sure people don't think VoIP is that unreliable.  

If you're going to throw in the VoIP information to get some references when people go for a CCNP, make sure you atleast throw that in there cause it can DEFINATELY cause some confusion in the beginning.  I know this is the CCNA not the CCNP, but its still nice to have proper information.

Though you shouldn't confuse it with RTP Protocol, cause that Real-Time Transfer Protocol has been called RTP, from what i've seen.  I do not have any experience with Real-Time Transfer Protocol, but I have read about it from a few sources, though most of them internet based, I'm not sure how well you can trust them.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">We will have here, a more general theorem on the expansion of a determinant based on more than one row or column.

Let us have a square matrix M or order n. Let us specify 0&lt;k&lt;n rows and columns. The intersection of those rows and columns form a square matrix of order k. Such a matrix is called a minor of order k. We shall denote such a minor with the following notation:

&lt;math&gt;M_{j_1,j_2,...,j_k}^{i_1,i_2,...,i_k}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;i_1,i_2,...,i_k&lt;/math&gt; specify the selected rows and where &lt;math&gt;j_1,j_2,...,j_k&lt;/math&gt; specify the selected columns.

Now suppose that we delete the selected columns and rows. Then, again, we have a square matrix, this time of order n-k. This is called the '''complementary minor''' of the previous minor.

Consider the minor &lt;math&gt;M_{1,2,3,...,k}^{1,2,3,...,k}&lt;/math&gt; consisting of the first k rows and columns.

Now consider all the terms of the determinant M such that the elements of the first k columns also belong to the first k rows. Let such a term be denoted q. Its first k terms is in the minor &lt;math&gt;M_{1,2,3,...,k}^{1,2,3,...,k}&lt;/math&gt;. Now we shall determine the sign in front of this term in the determinant. The first k factors are all in the minor, so the number of reversals among the first k terms is the same as the number of reversals in the minor. The last n-k terms are all in the complementary minor so the number of reversals among the last n-k terms is the same as the number of reversals in the complementary minor. Note how there is no reversal between the first k terms, and the last n-k terms. Thus, the total number of reversals is the sum of the reversals in the minor and in the complementary minor. Let the number of reversals in the minor be denoted &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt; and let the number of reversals in the minor be denoted &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt;. Then the sign of the term in the determinant M is simply &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{r_1+r_2}&lt;/math&gt;, so it is equal to the product of the signs of the term in the minor and the term in the complementary minor. Thus, we can conclude that the product of one term in the minor, and one term in the complementary minor gives a term in the determinant M. Moreover, for all terms in the determinant M, there exists the corresponding two terms in the minor and complementary minor. Thus, the sum of all terms whose first k factors are also in the first k rows, is exactly equal to the product of the minor &lt;math&gt;M_{1,2,3,...,k}^{1,2,3,...,k}&lt;/math&gt; and its complementary minor.

Now we consider an arbitrary minor

&lt;math&gt;M_{j_1,j_2,...,j_k}^{i_1,i_2,...,i_k}&lt;/math&gt;.

We can exchange rows and columns of the matrix M until all the rows and columns of the minor are in the top-left corner. This requires a total of &lt;math&gt;(i_1-1)+(i_2-2)+...+(i_k-k)+(j_1-1)+(j_2-2)+...+(j_k-k)&lt;/math&gt; exchanges of rows. Thus, in performing the rows exchanges, it is multiplied by -1 that many times, or, to factor out even powers of -1, it is multiplied by &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{\sum_{z=0}^k i_z + \sum_{z=0}^k j_z}&lt;/math&gt;.

We have already proved that the sum of all terms with k terms in the first k rows and columns is the product of the minor with its complementary minor. Thus, the sum of all terms with k terms in the rows and columns of the minor is essentially the product of the determinant of the minor, times the product of the determinant of the complementary minor, multiplied by &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{\sum_{z=0}^k i_z + \sum_{z=0}^k j_z}&lt;/math&gt;.

If we denote the complementary minor of 
&lt;math&gt;M_{j_1,j_2,...,j_k}^{i_1,i_2,...,i_k}&lt;/math&gt; as 
&lt;math&gt;K_{j_1,j_2,...,j_k}^{i_1,i_2,...,i_k}&lt;/math&gt;

Then we can express this relation the sum as &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{\sum_{z=0}^k i_z + \sum_{z=0}^k j_z}M_{j_1,j_2,...,j_k}^{i_1,i_2,...,i_k}K_{j_1,j_2,...,j_k}^{i_1,i_2,...,i_k}&lt;/math&gt;

Or

&lt;math&gt;M_{j_1,j_2,...,j_k}^{i_1,i_2,...,i_k}A_{j_1,j_2,...,j_k}^{i_1,i_2,...,i_k}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;A_{j_1,j_2,...,j_k}^{i_1,i_2,...,i_k}=(-1)^{\sum_{z=0}^k i_z + \sum_{z=0}^k j_z}K_{j_1,j_2,...,j_k}^{i_1,i_2,...,i_k}&lt;/math&gt; is called the cofactor of the minor &lt;math&gt;&lt;math&gt;M_{j_1,j_2,...,j_k}^{i_1,i_2,...,i_k}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since all terms of the determinant M has at least k terms in the minor, one on each selected row, we can make a selection of rows, and then group together all the terms which pass through a selection of columns. We have already proven that the sum of all such terms is the product of the minor with its cofactor. Since we can select any term by making an appropriate selection of columns, all terms are in one of the groups characterized by such a selection of columns. Thus, all the groups contain all terms of the determinant, and therefore, if we are given a selection of k rows &lt;math&gt;i_1,i_2,...,i_k&lt;/math&gt; the determinant can be characterized as the sum

&lt;math&gt;\sum M_{j_1,j_2,...,j_k}^{i_1,i_2,...,i_k}A_{j_1,j_2,...,j_k}^{i_1,i_2,...,i_k}&lt;/math&gt; where the columns vary over all possible combinations of k columns.

Of course, an analogous result that given a selection of k columns, that the determinant can also be characterized as the sum of all products of minors with their cofactors, where the rows vary over all combinations of k rows, can be proved in an analogous method.

== [[First Aid]] ==

I did undo the edit you made to the section on spinal injuries - we had made that a relative instead of absolute length because
*it is an international book - not everyone will be familiar with a given measurement system
*people are bad at estimating absolute distances
Thanks for your help &amp; I welcome other changes you might make to the book, particularly in [[First Aid/Advanced Topics]], which is still unfinished. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:59, 1 August 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Geometric Algebra link on this page. ==

I've been learning Geometric algebra and some associated physics as a self study project.  I see there's a link on this page under see also:

http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Geometric_algebra&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1

but this page does not exist.  Was it intended to be a chapter of this abstract algebra book or a separate book?  I've dumped a fair amount of simple geometric algebra content into the wikipedia page:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra

but not all of it is really appropriate (I have the urge to write more than is encyclopedic, and have started to collect notes in standalone latex instead of contributing to wikipedia).  I'd say that it would make more sense to move some of it here, but perhaps as a separate (physics biased) book.

A very rough possible outline is as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
motivation and definition
   dot product
   wedge product
axiomatic development
   contraction, linearity, associativity
identities
   norm
   vector inversion
   lagrange.
   determinants
   grade
   reversion
   generalized dot and wedge product
   commutator
examples
   orthogonal decomposition
   bivectors
   trivectors
   generalized exponentials
   cross product
   complex numbers
   quaternions
   reciprocal frame relations
      raised and lowered indexes
      components of vectors with non-orthonormal basis vectors.
   gradient
   antisymetric tensors and bivector representation.
   reduction identities
   wedge product use to solve linear systems.
geometry
   lines, planes, conics, ...
   angle between lines, planes, ...
   projection and rejection
      comparision to matrix methods.
   rotors
   area
   volume
   intersection of spaces
      line and line
      line and plane
      plane and plane
physical examples
   torque
   radial velocity and acceleration
   spacetime gradient
   lorentz boost
   maxwells equations
   rigid bodies
      kinetic energy of rotating body.  comparision to cross product variation.
   spherical triangulation
      (measurement of angles from well separated points on the earth).
history
references and learning material
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Use of α in the definition of the Clifford group ==

:Many authors define the Clifford group slightly differently, by replacing 
the action ''xv''α(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; by ''xvx''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This produces the same Clifford group.

I believe the statement that &quot;this produces the same Clifford group&quot; is wrong.  Or I'm confused.  Consider the case of a positive definite quadratic form ''Q'' over a 3-dimensional real vector space ''V'', and write &lt;math&gt;e_1,e_2,e_3&lt;/math&gt; for some orthonormal basis.  Then the element &lt;math&gt;u = e_1 e_2 e_3&lt;/math&gt; of the Clifford algebra is central and its inverse is &lt;math&gt;-u&lt;/math&gt; which is also &lt;math&gt;\alpha(u)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u^t&lt;/math&gt;.  Being central, it belongs to the Clifford group with either definition: so far so good.  But now consider the element &lt;math&gt;x = \cos\theta + \sin\theta\,u&lt;/math&gt;: this is again central, so that &lt;math&gt;xvx^{-1} = v&lt;/math&gt; for all ''v'' in ''V'' and it belongs to the Clifford group with the second (alternative) definition.   However, &lt;math&gt;\alpha(x)^{-1} = x&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;xv\alpha(x)^{-1} = x^2 v = \cos2\theta\, v + \sin2\theta\,uv&lt;/math&gt; and the second term is not in ''V'' for &amp;theta; not a multiple of &amp;pi;/2 so that ''x'' does not belong to the Clifford group with the first (main) definition.  Also, this element ''x'' is neither purely even nor purely odd.  Presumably (actually, quite trivially) the definitions become equivalent if ''x'' is assumed up front to be purely even or odd, but the one with &lt;math&gt;xv\alpha(x)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; does not need to assume this (or something).  Any comments before I try to fix this?  --[[User:Gro-Tsen|Gro-Tsen]] ([[User talk:Gro-Tsen|talk]]) 18:49, 4 September 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Natural Selection==
===Mutations===
A '''normalizing''' or '''stabilizing''' mutation favors those individuals that are like those that came before. Example: Snakes on an island on lake Erie are grey. If any are born with stripes they get eaten, so most snakes on the island remain grey.

'''Directional''' mutations are ones that go in one direction over time. The fossil record shows that the ancestors of horses were shorter. As time went on, larger animals were favored and survived so the species as a whole got larger.

'''Diversifying''' selection is when two or more phenotypes are maintained. For example near copper mines some of the soil is heavily contaminated with copper. Some alleles allow growth of plants on the copper. Wild type plants will die on the copper, so both alleles are maintained in the population.

In rare cases such a dimorphism of environment leads the species to divide into groups. This is called a '''disruptive''' selection.

===Speciation===

A '''species''' according to the biological species concept is defined as a group of actually or potentially interbreeding individuals reproductively isolated from others.

Factors such as mutation can cause a species to change into another species. This is called '''speciation'''. There are many ways that speciation can occur.

Speciation often occurs because individuals of a species cannot breed with each other. It is called '''reproductive isolation'''. When individuals are reproductively isolated, they begin to differ from each other. 

Methods that occur before fertilization are called '''prezygotic'''. Those that occur after fertilization are called '''postzygotic'''. Prezygotic methods include ''ecological isolation'', ''behavioral isolation'', ''mechanical isolation'', ''temporal isolation''. Postzygotic isolation includes ''hybrid inviability''. ''hybrid sterility'', ''hybrid breakdown'' which occurs when there is reduced viability in later generations.

===Methods of Species Change ===

When some kind of barrier like a mountain rises up between two groups of the same species,  it may cause ''allopatric speciation''. Sometimes species will split without geographic isolation for reasons such as chromosome duplication (polyploidy). When new species result this way it is called ''sympatric speciation''.

Sometimes it is hard to tell if two species have descended from a common ancestor ( share a phylogeny). When two organisms who may or may not be distantly related develop a similar appearance that evolved completely independently it is called '''parallel evolution'''.

When organisms that are only distantly related develop analogous modifications (similar structures) because of similar selective forces on them, it is called ''convergent'' evolution. Examples include how dolphins and penguins have fins because they live in the ocean. ''divergent'' evolution happens when a species splits and forms different but related new species. This is also called ''radiation''.


'''Homology''' occurs when some biological structure derives from the same ancestral structure. For example what became hands for humans became wings for birds and bats.

With image restoration, the first decisions are often the most important ones.  It's important to select an image that has good potential and fits your skills.  

==Clarify goals==
Some historic images have the potential to become featured pictures with a good restoration.  Other times, because of limitations in the digital file or the scan the original image, a restoration can only go so far.

Here's an image of judge [[w:Learned Hand|Learned Hand]] as a student:

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Learned Hand at Harvard.jpg|A historic and useful image, but one that will never be a visual knockout.  The photographer took the shot off center and cut off the building arch, and the file is low resolution.
Image:Learned Hand at Harvarda.jpg|After restoration: rotated and cropped, with ink marks removed and tears repaired.  A small area of trouser leg at lower left was reconstructed.  Levels adjusted.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Click on the thumbnails for the student portrait shows that the original version above was 922 × 682 pixel, file size: 136 KB, MIME type: image/jpeg.  Compare that to the size below for a restoration that became a featured picture.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Stonemasonry.jpg|2,613 × 3,519 pixels, file size: 3.25 MB, MIME type: image/jpeg
Image:Stone_sculptor_at_work.jpg|2,613 × 3,519 pixels, file size: 3.52 MB, MIME type: image/jpeg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

It may be a humbler subject--just a stonemason at work instead of law students at Harvard--but the photographic composition is pleasing and it serves as a good illustration of stonemasonry using traditional tools.  The file size is also more than 20 times greater.  Large files take more time to repair, but they also carry more information at high resolution.

One type of restoration isn't necessarily better than the other: both serve useful purposes.  Be realistic about what your aims are, and about how much time and effort you intend to devote to a restoration.  A skilled restorationist could do the student portrait in an hour, but the stonemason image would take a couple of days.

==Be realistic about your skills==

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Locomotives-Roundhouse.jpg|A good candidate for a beginning restorationist: moderate amounts of dust, dirt, and fiber to remove.
Image:Doubledayuncropped.jpg|A tough challenge.  Good quality scan and high resolution file, but a severely damaged portrait.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

One of the key factors in a successful business is to know what your customers are thinking - about your business, your products, your services. As a business owner, you'll get feedback from your current customers just in the course of day-to-day business. But the results can be skewed by the interaction itself, and so most business owners find it useful to allow their customers to answer questions anonymously. And that's where surveys come in.

Anywhere on One of the best tool for online survey is [http://www.magicsurveytool.com Survey Software] generally falls into two categories. The first type gets installed on your computer and allows you to run the show yourself, and the other type is a hosted application on the web that can be accessed from any computer on the web. The second type gives you the flexibility of operating your software from earth.

Some businesses hire market research firms to survey their customers or target customers. For new or smaller businesses, this can be an expensive proposition

The Online Survey method has many clear benefits over other methods of surveying. But as simple and easy it may sound, it also can have certain limitations. For instance, this method may not give a representative sample, as everybody does not have access to a PC and the internet. In some cases, online survey software should be used to complement other methods, and not as a total replacement of conventional methods. Our Online Survey Software is a best option of conducting your own business.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Customer Survey - Avoid Customer Survey can create problems and loses of clients'''

Many companies in the world have spent millions of dollars on &quot;Customer Relationship Management Software&quot;(CRM), the investments have not yet proven to be worthwhile due to kinds of data being collected on a daily basis. Most of the data obtained by CRM systems is very number's heavy and contains details of transactions including how much, total cost, price, etc. 

However you plan on conducting customer satisfaction surveys, always keep your customer's time and loyalty at the top of your mind. Too many surveys, emails, phone calls - are only going to annoy them. Keep them on your side by showing them exactly what you are going to do with their feedback, and show them the results when it's done.

A [http://www.magicsurveytool.com Customer Survey] will help you not only identify problem areas but will also demonstrate to your customers that you care and are proactive in looking for ways to improve the service that you provide.

The Customer Satisfaction Survey is the answer. The best way to find out your customer satisfaction and loyalty, while collecting strong testimonials you can use in other sales and marketing tools, is to ask. It's that simple.

Customer service is an endangered species in today’s business environment. This fact is not just a constant annoyance to consumers; it also presents a great opportunity for any business that wants to separate itself from its competitors. But you’ll need more than a catchy slogan to make your company customer focused. It takes total commitment from everyone in the company to make customers totally satisfied. Another study shows that a “totally satisfied” customer is six times more likely to become a repeat customer than someone who describes herself as “satisfied.” That means total satisfaction should be every company’s goal.</text>

== How do we reveal the secrets of Wilson current mirror? ==

''I dedicate all my insights about this legendary circuit that I will expose in this discussion to my love who inspires me to continue revealing the secrets of electronic circuits. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 14:18, 19 July 2008 (UTC)''

[[Image:Wilson_cs.GIF|thumb|170px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1. Wilson current mirror&lt;center&gt;]]

=== The great challenge === 

It was a challenge to reveal the idea behind the popular BJT current mirror&lt;ref&gt;[[Talk:Current mirror#Revealing the philosophy of the current mirror|Talk:Current mirror]] reveals the secrets behind the simple current mirror circuits.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikibooks:Circuit Idea/How to Reverse Current Direction|How to reverse current direction]] reveals the secret of the simple current mirror.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikibooks:Circuit Idea/Group 66b#Lab 3: Transistor circuits (trying to create a &quot;diode&quot; current mirror|Can a &quot;diode&quot; current mirror exist?]] begins revaling the secret of the current mirror by reinventing it.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikibooks:Circuit Idea/Group 67b#Lab 3: Transistor circuits (&quot;inventing&quot; a BJT current mirror)|Building a BJT current mirror]] continues reinventing the simple BJT current mirror.&lt;/ref&gt;; but it is a great challenge to disclosure the mystery of the legendary Wilson current mirror (Fig. 1)! Maybe, there is no so simple (containing only three transistors) and, at the same time, so incomprehensible and misunderstood circuit as Wilson current mirror. There are many [[#Resources|resources]] that have tried to explain this sophisticated, ingenious and elegant circuit solution by using formal methods. But they do not give us what we need, first and foremost, as human beings - the basic idea(s) behind this odd, strange and exotic circuit. It is a great paradox to calculate circuit without knowing the basic idea behind it!?! So, before showing in detail how to calculate the electronic circuit in this Wikipedia page we have first to show what the very basic idea is behind the circuit. 

=== The purposes of this discussion ===

I start this discussion with a few purposes. First of all, I would like to provoke creative Wikipedians:) who are bold enough not only to convey blindly &quot;cut &amp; paste&quot; knowledge from &quot;reputable sources&quot; but to process it first and even to add their own viewpoint (as far as [[No original research|NOR]] allows such a liberty:) Frankly, judging by my [[Talk:Current mirror#Revealing the philosophy of the current mirror|previous attempts]], I do not cherish great hopes to make Wikipedians join this discussion; but yet I try it again with the hope that someone will use this &quot;wisdom&quot; to improve the main article. I would rather believe that some reputable author (e.g., Tony Kuphaldt) would join this discussion. Second, I will use this discussion as a base of a few [[wikibooks:Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]] stories dedicated to the legendary circuit. Finally, I will use these materials to compose two papers for [http://csconf.org/csconf/ Computer science 2008] conference that I will join in September (I do not cherish hope that I will impress my computer-oriented colleagues by these low-level circuit insights but I will try:) [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 16:07, 28 July 2008 (UTC)

=== Questions to be answered ===

Looking at the circuit diagram (Fig. 1), we need to answer dozens of questions that are never answered.

''What does the transistor Q&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; do in this circuit? What is its function there? Why this current mirror contains another simpler current mirror Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (why an additional simple current mirror is nested in the main current mirror)?!?! What is its function? But why this simple current mirror is reversed (why the transistors Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are swapped)?  Why the Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'s collector current serves as an input quantity and the Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'s collector current as an output one (we thought the Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'s collector current was the input quantity and the Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'s collector current was the output quantity)? Are there negative feedbacks in Wilson current mirror? If there are, what are they? How many negative feedbacks there are? What are their functions (why they are included)? What and how do they control - voltage or current? What are the advantages of Wilson current mirror versus current mirror with emitter degeneration? How does Wilson current mirror keep up an almost constant current (why it has an almost infinite output resistance)? Why the input and output currents are almost equal (what is the trick)? Has a MOSFET Wilson current mirror any advantage versus the simple MOSFET current mirror?

=== Heuristic approach ===

Since there are no satisfactory answers to the questions above, let's try to disclose the mystery of the famous circuit by ourselves; let's answer these questions relying mainly on our human intuition, imagination and common sense. Please, just forget all kinds &quot;cut-and-dried&quot; citations and begin thinking by yourself to make an exciting discussion here!&lt;br&gt;
The best way of understanding and presenting electronic circuits is by reinventing them, by showing the circuit evolution&lt;ref&gt;[[wikibooks:Circuit Idea/Philosophy#A heuristic approach|The philosophy behind the ''Circuit idea'' Wikibook]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ewme&quot;&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my_work/conferences/ewme_2006/paper.htm A heuristic approach to teaching analog electronics] relies on human imagination, intuition and emotions.&lt;/ref&gt;. So, let's imagine how Wilson has invented his current mirror by &quot;inventing&quot; and building it, in order to grasp the basic ideas behind the circuit and then to present them in an attractive manner to readers. Of course, it would be wonderful if the very Wilson, if he is still alive, would expose how he has invented the famous circuit. Only, it is a well-known truth that, as a rule, due to variety of reasons, inventors do not show willigness for disclosing the process of invention&lt;ref&gt;[[wikibooks:Circuit Idea/Why Circuit Ideas are Hidden#Willingness for disclosing|Why circuit ideas are hidden]] considers the fate of new circuit ideas.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== The imperfections of the simple current mirror ===

[[Image:Simple bipolar mirror.svg|thumbnail|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2. The simple current mirror&lt;/center&gt;]]

The simple BJT current mirror (Fig. 2) has two main imperfections: first, the output current differs from the input one because of the two base currents that the transistors Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &quot;suck&quot; from the input current; second, the output current varies when the output (load) voltage changes because of the Early effect. These are completely different problems; there is no any connection between them. Wilson was a lucky man; in the early 60's, he &quot;killed two birds with one stone&quot; - adding only one transistor to the humble current mirror, he managed to remove the both imperfections of the simple BJT current mirror!

The simple [[Current mirror#Basic MOSFET current mirror|MOSFET current mirror]] has only the second imperfection because there are no gate currents. And even in this case the Wilson idea is beneficial; it enables the MOSFET Wilson current source to keep up a constant output current.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== How the Wilson current mirror equalizes the input and output currents ==

=== The current difference in the BJT simple current mirror ===

Let's first show, in the beginning of the discussion, how the Wilson current mirror eleiminates the difference between the input and output currents. I intend to create a relevant [[wikibooks:Circuit Idea/How the Wilson current mirror equalizes the currents|Circuit idea story]]&lt;ref&gt;[[wikibooks:Circuit Idea/How the Wilson current mirror equalizes the currents|How the Wilson current mirror equalizes the currents]] reveals the secret of Wilson's &quot;current equalizing trick&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; about this clever trick and will copy this discussion there.

[[Image:Simple_current_mirror_a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3a. The problem of the simple BJT current mirror.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Simple_current_mirror_1000.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3b. A simple BJT current mirror (a current map)&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Current map.''' In order to grasp the ideas behind circuits, we may [[wikibooks:Circuit Idea/Philosophy/#Visualization|visualize]] electrical quantities ''voltage'' and ''current'' by voltage bars and current loops. In the case of current mirrors, it is extremely interesting to show where currents flow and to visualize their magnitudes. So, I suggest to draw two kinds of figures. The first, placed on the left, will represent the respective circuit diagram with superimposed voltage and current &quot;maps&quot;. The second, placed on the right, will visualize the magnitudes of the currents by fat lines whose thickness is proportional to the magnitude of the corresponding current.

Let's begin with presenting the simple BJT current mirror in such an attractive way (Fig. 3). The lines on the right figure are actully sections of closed current loops. The transistors are shown with extremely low ß (on this figure ß = 4), in order to present the base currents by thick enough lines.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Equalizing the currents by &quot;pushing&quot; 2I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; to I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;... ===

How do we solve the poblem of the two I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; in the simple BJT current mirror? Let's begin thinking relying on our human common sense... We know from daily routine the great idea of ''compensation'': if there are some losses of something, we might compensate them by adding the same quantity of this &quot;thing&quot;. So, let's put in practice this powerful idea!

[[Image:Current_mirror_pushing2ib_a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4a. Compensating by injecting 2Ib.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Current_mirror_pushing2ib_1000.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4b. Pushing 2Ib to Iin (a current map)&lt;/center&gt;]]

Since the transistors &quot;suck&quot; two I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, the first idea that might dawn on us is, of course, to add the same two I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;. Then I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - 2I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; + 2I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. For this purpose, we have to connect an injecting current source 2I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; to the T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'s collector (more precisely speaking, this is rather a ''current-stable resistor'' than a source).&lt;br&gt;
Only, this has to be not an ordinary constant current source but a &quot;following&quot; current source that copies the current 2I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;. What an idiocy! It turns out that we need another current mirror?!?

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== ...by &quot;sucking&quot; 2I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; from I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;... ===

[[Image:Current_mirror_sucking2ib_a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5a. Compensating by sinking 2Ib.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Current_mirror_sucking2ib_1000.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5b. Sucking 2Ib from Iout  (a current map)&lt;/center&gt;]]

Above, we have added the two compensating base currents by injecting them into the input current (the &quot;original&quot; quantity). But with the same success we might add them to the output current (the &quot;copy&quot;) by &quot;sucking&quot;  2I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; from it. Now I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; - 2I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; + 2I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case, we have to connect a sinking current source 2I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; to the T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'s collector.&lt;br&gt;
As before, this has to be not an ordinary constant current source but a &quot;following&quot; current source that copies the current 2I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== ...by &quot;sucking&quot; I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; from I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; and &quot;pushing&quot; I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; to I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;... ===

We have almost reached the great Wilson's current equalizing idea... Well, let's continue thinking. It is inconvenient to create 2I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;; it is easier to produce (source or sink) 
only I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;. What do we do then?

[[Image:Current_mirror_sinking_and_sucking2ib_a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6a. Equalizing the currents by both &quot;sucking&quot; and &quot;pushing&quot; I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Wilson_current_mirror_reversed_1000.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6b. Sucking Ib from Iout and &quot;pushing&quot; Ib to Iin (a current map)&lt;/center&gt;]]

Eureka! We might connect a current source between the two collectors that sinks a current I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; from I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; and injects the same current I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; into I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; (Fig. 6a)! In this way, we add one base current to the input current and another base current to the output current. As a result, the two currents become equal:

&lt;center&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Here is the great Wilson's idea! In order to equalize the two currents, '''''he has &quot;moved&quot; one base current from the one to the other leg'''''!

Don't you think this connection resembles a bridge circuit (the current source serves as a &quot;bridge&quot; between the two circuit legs)?

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Realizing the Wilson's current equalizing idea ===

Once we revealed the brilliant Wilson's idea we have only to implement it. Let's continue thinking...

[[Image:Wilson_current_mirror_reversed_a_1000.jpg|left|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7a. Finally, we have got a nearly Wilson current mirror circuit&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Wilson_current_mirror_reversed_1000.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7b. A copy of Fig. 6a.&lt;/center&gt;]]

What is this mysterious element that can consume I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; from one part of the circuit and can add it to other part? Of course, there is nothing more natural for a bipolar transistor to do that &quot;donkey work&quot;! It &quot;sucks&quot; I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; from the point where its base is connected and adds it to the emitter current. Then let's connect a transistor T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in the left leg of our circuit (Fig. 6a)!

Wonderful, now it sinks the current I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; from I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; and injects the same current I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; into I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;! So, we have managed to reveal the role of the mysterious transistor T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;!

'''''In the circuit of Wilson current mirror, the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &quot;moves&quot; one base current from the right to the left leg'''''.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Reversing the circuit to obtain the true Wilson current mirror ===

Only, this connection mustn't change the current in the left leg. For this purpose, the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has to adjust its base current so that its collector current to remain unchanged. The only &quot;thing&quot; that can do this magic is the ubiquitous negative feedback that keeps up an almost constant voltage (this should be the same kind of negative feedback as this applied to the transistor T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). But there isn't a feedback in this input part of the circuit; there is no connection between the T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'s collector and base. What do we do then?

== current mirror question ==

hi,

i have no idea on how and where to ask a question and/or join a &quot;discussion&quot; in wikibooks, if this posting is not appropriate, please delete, thanks!

great philosophy and books/articles, very much needed and appreciated!

question on the current mirror:

Q3's base takes one Ib from one leg of the current mirror circuit with its base current Ib, and adds one Ib to the other leg through its Ic. but doesn't Q3 have a current gain? would the current added to the other leg be (beta)x(Ib) instead of just Ib and therefore make the current flowing though the two legs unequal? where did i go wrong in reasoning this way?

i realize that, in nature, this question may be the same as my question on emitter follower. since Ic=Ie almost, Ib should have the same influence on both Ic and Ie, to the same degree almost, why then there is no amplification if we take the output from the emitter instead of the collector?  

thank you very much for helping!

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Writing systems of Punjabi'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

We have noted that Punjabi is spoken in Punjab, India as well as Punjab, Pakistan. There are different writing systems on either side of the international border. It is written in [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi|Gurmukhi]] script in India. Gurmukhi is also the official script of Punjabi there. However Shahmukhi script is used to write Punjabi in Pakistan. In this Part we are concerned with Punjabi as written in Shahmukhi script.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Punjabi/NavigateShahmukhi}}

==Introduction==
As you have already read, Shahmukhi is used to write the Punjabi language by Punjabi speakers in Pakistan.  It is written from right to left.  The Shahmukhi script is based on the Perso-Arabic script which is used to write Urdu.  Shahmukhi cannot be called an alphabet; it is really an abjad.  An abjad is a script that has letters to represent consonants but not vowels.  Of course, Shahmukhi, and other scripts relating to it, are impure abjads.  This means that there are ways to represent vowels in the writing but they are used in a very bare method.  There are 38 letters in the Shahmukhi abjad.  This may seem like a lot to learn, but the letters are really not too difficult to remember. 


The letters are:


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ا ب پ ت ٹ ث&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
 
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ج چ ح خ د ڈ ذ&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
 
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ر ڑ ز ژ س ش ص ض&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ط ظ ع غ ف ق ک گ&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ل م ن و ه ھ ى ے&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;


The letters each have 4 forms: independent, initial, medial, and final.  This means that the letters change form according to where they are in a word to help the letters connect well.  This will become clear as you proceed through this lesson. 

The independent forms will not be explicitly repeatedly told to you because each letter heading contains the independent form of that letter along with its romanized name, and the script chart above shows the independent form of each letter.  

The lessons will be provided in a way so that you will learn the letters row by row.  

Therefore, you will now be taught these: 

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ب پ ت ٹ ث &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

You will begin with bē.  Alef will be taught later in Lesson 6.

==Romanization==

Throughout the lesson you will be presented with words written in Shahmukhi, with romanization next to each word, and then its definition.  

The romanization of each consonant will be presented throughout the lessons.  For example, when you begin with bē, you will be taught how to pronounce it, and how it will be represented in the romanization before you are taught its multiple forms.  

As for the vowels, you will be taught their romanization when you reach Lesson 6.  Therefore, when you are reading the words throughout the consonant lessons, try to focus more on memorizing the multiple letter forms rather than on pronunciation of the vowels in the romanization.  Once you get to Lesson 6, you will be taught the vowels used in Punjabi, how they are represented in Shahmukhi, and how they are represented in romanization.  Then, if you so desire, you can go through Lessons 1 to 5 again and work on your pronunciation of the example words.

==bē - ب==

Bē will be your first letter.  

It is pronounced like the English &quot;b&quot;.  It will therefore be represented by &quot;b&quot; in romanization.  

=====Initial=====

When used at the beginning of a word, bē will be used like this:


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; بورڈ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - borḍ - board

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; برش &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - burash - brush


Note how bē connects to wāw in the first example and rē in the second example.

=====Medial=====

When used in the middle of a word, it is used like this:


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; چھبّی &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - chhabbī - 26

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; کباب &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - kabāb - roasted meat (Urdu)

=====Final=====

At the end of a word, bē appears like this:


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ننکانہ صاحب &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  - nankānah '''sāhib''' - Nankana Sahib (a district of Punjab, Pakistan)

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; نب &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - nib 


Note how hē connects to bē at the end of sāhib and nūn to bē in nib.

==pē - پ==

Pē (along with tē, ṭē, and sē) connects to letters in exactly the same way as bē does.  The only difference is in the diacritics.  Instead of one dot like bē, you need three dots underneath the letter.  

It is pronounced like the English &quot;p&quot;.  It will therefore be represented by &quot;p&quot; in romanization.  

=====Initial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; پنجاب &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - panjāb - Punjab 

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; پاکستان &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - pākistān - Pakistan

=====Medial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; کيپسول &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - caipsūl - capsule

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; پيپر &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - pēpar - paper

=====Final=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; کلپ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - clip

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ٹپّ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - ṭapp - jump

==tē - ت==

The same again, but with two dots over the letter.

It is pronounced somewhat like the English &quot;t&quot; however, instead of placing the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth like you would do if you were normally pronouncing t, place the tip of your tongue behind your upper teeth.  This is called a dental t.  It will be represented by &quot;t&quot; in romanization.  

=====Initial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ترپرا &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - tripurā - Tripurā (a state in North-East India)

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; تمل  &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - tamil - Tamil

=====Medial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; مکتسر &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - muktsar - Muktsar (a city in Punjab, India)

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ملتان &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - multān - Multan (a city in Punjab, Pakistan)

=====Final=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; گلگت &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - gilgit - Gilgit (the capital city of the Northern Areas, Pakistan)

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;  شجاعت &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - shujāt - Shujaat (a name)

==ṭē - ٹ==

Now you have a small tōē above the letter.

It is pronounced like the English &quot;t&quot;, however it will be represented by &quot;ṭ&quot; in romanization.  

=====Initial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ٹوپ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - ṭaup - top

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ٹريکٹر &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - ṭraikṭar - tractor

=====Medial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; سٹيج &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - sṭēj - stage

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ميٹر &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - mīṭar - meter

=====Final=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; پليٹ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - plēṭ - plate

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; گلٹ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - gēṭ - gate

==sē - ث==

Now there are three dots above.  

It is pronounced like the English &quot;s&quot;.  It will therefore be represented by &quot;s&quot; in romanization. 

=====Initial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ثالث &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - sālis - arbitrator (Urdu)

Final position is also shown in this example.

=====Medial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; نثار &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - nisār - sacrifice (Urdu)

==Summary==


You have now been taught how to use bē, pē, tē, ṭē, and sē.  Since they all have the same forms with only differing diacritics, it should not be too difficult for you to memorize these letters and their forms.  

When you're ready, proceed to Lesson 2.

== [[Japanese]] ==

Welcome Akaihen,

Thank you for your interest in the [[Japanese]] wikibook. It's an old book (started in 2003) but no-one has stuck with it long enough to make it into something decent. Many have added content, but rather than revise what was previously there, they added their versions of it.

The most recent undertaking is less of a rewrite and more of a restructuring; getting an overview of what we already have, merging the duplicate material, deleting redundant pages and organising the rest of the book so that future editors can continue to mold it into something good and gracefully add more material. If you are interested in working on this book, your time and efforts would be greatly appreciated.

I hope you won't be offended by the fact that I reverted your edits to the [[Japanese]] main page. I'd be careful with creating links to non-existant pages in this book when we already have plenty of material. If you are interested in the grammar, you may want to have a look at [[Japanese/Contents#Pure grammar and barely vocab/structure]] and play around with the pages there. If you have no particular area of interest, but are willing to help with anything, feel free to browse around [[Japanese/Contents]] and pick whatever you like. You can also join us on [[Talk:Japanese]].

All the best,&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although we cannot have less than nothing in real life, we have to assume that since you can go all the way in one direction in counting up, that you can continue to count down in the other direction.

For example, when you're giving somebody apples, you can count those apples up; otherwise, if you take apples away from somebody, you carry out a negative action and, therefore, you should apply the negative counting. This way, such numbers are exactly called negatives, and they represent values less than zero.

If you have given somebody an apple, two apples, or three apples, your ''apple-giving'' may be assessed with the numbers 1, 2, or 3, respectively. But if you have taken 2, 4, or even 5 apples away from somebody, the actual &quot;apple-giving&quot; will deserve, indeed, '''negative''' assessment and, this way, may be represented by negative numbers, which are, in our case, '''-2''', '''-4''', and '''-5''' respectively.

== Examples==
-3 (pronounced &quot;Negative Three&quot; or &quot;Minus Three) &lt;br /&gt;
-5 &lt;br /&gt;
-10 &lt;br /&gt;
-11 &lt;br /&gt;

----
5 - 7 = -2 &lt;br /&gt;
10 - 19 = -9 &lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Pythagoras Theorem or the Pythagorean theorem, named after the Greek mathematician Pythagoras states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is usually summarized as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If we let ''c'' be the length of the hypotenuse and ''a'' and ''b'' be the lengths of the other two sides, the theorem can be expressed as the equation:

: &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2\, &lt;/math&gt;

or, solved for ''c'':

: &lt;math&gt; c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

If ''c'' is already given, and the length of one of the legs must be found, the following equations can be used (The following equations are simply the converse of the original equation):

: &lt;math&gt;c^2 - a^2 = b^2\, &lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;c^2 - b^2 = a^2.\, &lt;/math&gt;

This equation provides a simple relation among the three sides of a right triangle so that if the lengths of any two sides are known, the length of the third side can be found. A generalization of this theorem is the law of cosines, which allows the computation of the length of the third side of any triangle, given the lengths of two sides and the size of the angle between them. If the angle between the sides is a right angle it reduces to the Pythagorean theorem.

== History ==




The history of the theorem can be divided into four parts: knowledge of Pythagorean triples, knowledge of the relationship between the sides of a right triangle, knowledge of the relationship between adjacent angles, and proofs of the theorem.

Megalithic monuments from circa 2500 BC in Egypt, and in Northern Europe, incorporate right triangles with integer sides.
Bartel Leendert van der Waerden conjectures that these Pythagorean triples were discovered algebraically.

Written between 2000 and 1786 BC, the Middle Kingdom Egyptian papyrus ''Berlin 6619'' includes a problem whose solution is a Pythagorean triple.

During the reign of Hammurabi the Great, the Mesopotamian tablet ''Plimpton 322'', written between 1790 and 1750 BC, contains many entries closely related to Pythagorean triples.

The ''Baudhayana Sulba Sutra'', the dates of which are given variously as between the 8th century BC and the 2nd century BC, in India, contains a list of Pythagorean triples discovered algebraically, a statement of the Pythagorean theorem, and a geometrical proof of the Pythagorean theorem for an isosceles right triangle.

The ''Apastamba Sulba Sutra'' (circa 600 BC) contains a numerical proof of the general Pythagorean theorem, using an area computation. Van der Waerden believes that &quot;it was certainly based on earlier traditions&quot;. According to Albert Bŭrk, this is the original proof of the theorem; he further theorizes that Pythagoras visited Arakonam, India, and copied it.

Pythagoras, whose dates are commonly given as 569–475 BC, used algebraic methods to construct Pythagorean triples, according to Proklos's commentary on Euclid. Proklos, however, wrote between 410 and 485 AD. According to Sir Thomas L. Heath, there is no attribution of the theorem to Pythagoras for five centuries after Pythagoras lived. However, when authors such as Plutarch and Cicero attributed the theorem to Pythagoras, they did so in a way which suggests that the attribution was widely known and undoubted.

Around 400 BC, according to Proklos, Plato gave a method for finding Pythagorean triples that combined algebra and geometry. Circa 300 BC, in Euclid's ''Elements'', the oldest extant axiomatic proof of the theorem is presented.

Written sometime between 500 BC and 200 AD, the Chinese text ''Chou Pei Suan Ching'' (周髀算经), (''The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven'') gives a visual proof of the Pythagorean theorem — in China it is called the &quot;Gougu Theorem&quot; (勾股定理) — for the (3, 4, 5) triangle. During the Han Dynasty, from 202 BC to 220 AD, Pythagorean triples appear in ''The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art'', together with a mention of right triangles.

The first recorded use is in China, known as the &quot;Gougu theorem&quot; (勾股定理) and in India known as the Bhaskara Theorem.

There is much debate on whether the Pythagorean theorem was discovered once or many times. Boyer (1991) thinks the elements found in the Shulba Sutras may be of Mesopotamian derivation.

== Proofs ==
This is a theorem that may have more known proofs than any other; the book ''Pythagorean Proposition'', by Elisha Scott Loomis, contains 367 proofs.

=== Proof using similar triangles ===
[[Image:Proof-Pythagorean-Theorem.svg|thumb|right|Proof using similar triangles.]]
Like most of the proofs of the Pythagorean theorem, this one is based on the proportionality of the sides of two similar triangles.

Let ''ABC'' represent a right triangle, with the right angle located at ''C'', as shown on the figure. We draw the altitude from point ''C'', and call ''H'' its intersection with the side ''AB''. The new triangle ''ACH'' is similar to our triangle ''ABC'', because they both have a right angle (by definition of the altitude), and they share the angle at ''A'', meaning that the third angle will be the same in both triangles as well. By a similar reasoning, the triangle CBH is also similar to ''ABC''. The similarities lead to the two ratios..:
As
:&lt;math&gt; BC=a, AC=b, \text{ and } AB=c, \!&lt;/math&gt;
so
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{a}{c}=\frac{HB}{a} \mbox{ and } \frac{b}{c}=\frac{AH}{b}.\,&lt;/math&gt;
These can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;a^2=c\times HB \mbox{ and }b^2=c\times AH. \,&lt;/math&gt;
Summing these two equalities, we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2=c\times HB+c\times AH=c\times(HB+AH)=c^2 .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, the Pythagorean theorem:
:&lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2=c^2.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Euclid's proof===
[[Image:Illustration to Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem.svg|thumb|Proof in Euclid's ''Elements'']]
In Euclid's ''Elements'', Proposition 47 of Book 1, the Pythagorean theorem is proved by an argument along the following lines. Let ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' be the vertices of a right triangle, with a right angle at ''A''. Drop a perpendicular from ''A'' to the side opposite the hypotenuse in the square on the hypotenuse. That line divides the square on the hypotenuse into two rectangles, each having the same area as one of the two squares on the legs.

For the formal proof, we require four elementary lemmata:
# If two triangles have two sides of the one equal to two sides of the other, each to each, and the angles included by those sides equal, then the triangles are congruent. (Side - Angle - Side Theorem)
# The area of a triangle is half the area of any parallelogram on the same base and having the same altitude.
# The area of any square is equal to the product of two of its sides.
# The area of any rectangle is equal to the product of two adjacent sides (follows from Lemma 3).

The intuitive idea behind this proof, which can make it easier to follow, is that the top squares are morphed into parallelograms with the same size, then turned and morphed into the left and right rectangles in the lower square, again at constant area.

The proof is as follows:
#Let ACB be a right-angled triangle with right angle CAB.
#On each of the sides BC, AB, and CA, squares are drawn, CBDE, BAGF, and ACIH, in that order.
#From A, draw a line parallel to BD and CE. It will perpendicularly intersect BC and DE at K and L, respectively.
#Join CF and AD, to form the triangles BCF and BDA.
[[Image:Illustration to Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem2.svg|thumb|200px|Illustration including the new lines]]
#Angles CAB and BAG are both right angles; therefore C, A, and G are collinear. Similarly for B, A, and H.
#Angles CBD and FBA are both right angles; therefore angle ABD equals angle FBC, since both are the sum of a right angle and angle ABC.
#Since AB and BD are equal to FB and BC, respectively, triangle ABD must be equal to triangle FBC.
#Since A is collinear with K and L, rectangle BDLK must be twice in area to triangle ABD.
#Since C is collinear with A and G, square BAGF must be twice in area to triangle FBC.
#Therefore rectangle BDLK must have the same area as square BAGF = AB&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
#Similarly, it can be shown that rectangle CKLE must have the same area as square ACIH = AC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
#Adding these two results, AB&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + AC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = BD &amp;times; BK + KL &amp;times; KC
#Since BD = KL, BD* BK + KL &amp;times; KC = BD(BK + KC) = BD &amp;times; BC
#Therefore AB&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + AC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = BC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, since CBDE is a square.
This proof appears in Euclid's ''Elements'' as that of Proposition 1.47.

===Garfield's proof===
James A. Garfield (later President of the United States) is credited with a novel algebraic proof[http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/GarfieldsProofOfPythagoreanTheorem.html] using a trapezoid containing two examples of the triangle, the figure comprising one-half of the figure using four triangles enclosing a square shown below.

[[Image:Pythagorean proof (1).svg|thumb|Proof using area subtraction.]]
=== Similarity proof ===
From the same diagram as that in Euclid's proof above, we can see three similar figures, each being &quot;a square with a triangle on top&quot;. Since the large triangle is made of the two smaller triangles, its area is the sum of areas of the two smaller ones. By similarity, the three squares are in the same proportions relative to each other as the three triangles, and so likewise the area of the large square is the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares.

===Proof by rearrangement===
A proof by rearrangement is given by the illustration and the animation. In the illustration, the area of each large square is (''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In both, the area of four identical triangles is removed. The remaining areas, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, are equal. Q.E.D.
&lt;!--Images put in a row in order to avoid blank lines--&gt;
[[Image:Pythagoras-2a.gif|thumb|right|200px|Animation showing another proof by rearrangement.]]
[[Image:Pythagorean graphic.svg|thumb|Proof using rearrangement.]]
[[Image:Pythagproof.svg|thumb|right|A square created by aligning four right angle triangles and a large square.]]
This proof is indeed very simple, but it is not ''elementary'', in the sense that it does not depend solely upon the most basic axioms and theorems of Euclidean geometry. In particular, while it is quite easy to give a formula for area of triangles and squares, it is not as easy to prove that the area of a square is the sum of areas of its pieces. In fact, proving the necessary properties is harder than proving the Pythagorean theorem itself and Banach-Tarski paradox. Actually, this difficulty affects all simple Euclidean proofs involving area; for instance, deriving the area of a right triangle involves the assumption that it is half the area of a rectangle with the same height and base.  For this reason, axiomatic introductions to geometry usually employ another proof based on the similarity of triangles (see above).

A third graphic illustration of the Pythagorean theorem (in yellow and blue to the right) fits parts of the sides' squares into the hypotenuse's square. A related proof would show that the repositioned parts are identical with the originals and, since the sum of equals are equal, that the corresponding areas are equal. To show that a square is the result one must show that the length of the new sides equals ''c''. Note that for this proof to work, one must provide a way to handle cutting the small square in more and more slices as the corresponding side gets smaller and smaller.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/FaultyPythPWW.shtml Pythagorean Theorem: Subtle Dangers of Visual Proof] by Alexander Bogomolny, retrieved 19 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Algebraic proof ===
An algebraic variant of this proof is provided by the following reasoning. Looking at the illustration which is a large square with identical right triangles in its corners, the area of each of these four triangles is given by an angle corresponding with the side of length ''C''.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} AB.&lt;/math&gt;

The ''A''-side angle and ''B''-side angle of each of these triangles are complementary angles, so each of the angles of the blue area in the middle is a right angle, making this area a square with side length ''C''. The area of this square is ''C''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus the area of everything together is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;4\left(\frac{1}{2}AB\right)+C^2.&lt;/math&gt;
However, as the large square has sides of length ''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''B'', we can also calculate its area as (''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''B'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which expands to ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''2AB''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;A^2+2AB+B^2=4\left(\frac{1}{2}AB\right)+C^2.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: (Distribution of the 4) &lt;math&gt;A^2+2AB+B^2=2AB+C^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: (Subtraction of 2''AB'') &lt;math&gt;A^2+B^2=C^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Proof by differential equations ===
One can arrive at the Pythagorean theorem by studying how changes in a side produce a change in the hypotenuse in the following diagram and employing a little calculus.

[[Image:PythagoreanDerivation.svg|thumb|right|Proof using differential equations.]]

As a result of a change in side ''a'',
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {da}{dc} = \frac {c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

by similar triangles and for differential changes. So
:&lt;math&gt;c\, dc = a\,da&lt;/math&gt;

upon separation of variables.

which results from adding a second term for changes in side ''b''.

Integrating gives

:&lt;math&gt;c^2 = a^2 + \mathrm{constant}.\ \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

When ''a'' = 0 then ''c'' = ''b'', so the &quot;constant&quot; is ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  So

:&lt;math&gt;c^2 = a^2 + b^2.\,&lt;/math&gt;

As can be seen, the squares are due to the particular proportion between the changes and the sides while the sum is a result of the independent contributions of the changes in the sides which is not evident from the geometric proofs. From the proportion given it can be shown that the changes in the sides are inversely proportional to the sides. The differential equation suggests that the theorem is due to relative changes and its derivation is nearly equivalent to computing a line integral.

These quantities ''da'' and ''dc'' are respectively infinitely small changes in ''a'' and ''c''.  But we use instead real numbers &amp;Delta;''a'' and &amp;Delta;''c'', then the limit of their ratio as their sizes approach zero is ''da''/''dc'', the derivative, and also approaches ''c''/''a'', the ratio of lengths of sides of triangles, and the differential equation results.

== Converse ==
The converse of the theorem is also true:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For any three positive numbers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' such that ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, there exists a triangle with sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', and every such triangle has a right angle between the sides of lengths ''a'' and ''b''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This converse also appears in Euclid's ''Elements''. It can be proven using the law of cosines, or by the following proof:

Let ''ABC'' be a triangle with side lengths ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', with ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. We need to prove that the angle between the ''a'' and ''b'' sides is a right angle. We construct another triangle with a right angle between sides of lengths ''a'' and ''b''. By the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that the hypotenuse of this triangle also has length ''c''. Since both triangles have the same side lengths ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', they are congruent, and so they must have the same angles. Therefore, the angle between the side of lengths ''a'' and ''b'' in our original triangle is a right angle.

A corollary of the Pythagorean theorem's converse is a simple means of determining whether a triangle is right, obtuse, or acute, as follows. Where ''c'' is chosen to be the longest of the three sides:
* If ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then the triangle is right.
* If ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then the triangle is acute.
* If ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then the triangle is obtuse.

== Consequences and uses of the theorem ==
=== Pythagorean triples ===
A Pythagorean triple has 3 positive numbers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', such that &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, a Pythagorean triple represents the lengths of the sides of a right triangle where all three sides have integer lengths. Evidence from megalithic monuments on the Northern Europe shows that such triples were known before the discovery of writing. Such a triple is commonly written (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c'').  Some well-known examples are (3,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;5) and (5,&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;13).

===List of primitive Pythagorean triples up to 100===
&lt;!-- Please don't add NON-PRIMITIVE Pythagorean triples to this list such as (6,8,10) or (15,20,25) or (10,24,26). --&gt;

(3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (7, 24, 25), (8, 15, 17), (9, 40, 41), (11, 60, 61), (12, 35, 37), (13, 84, 85), (16, 63, 65), (20, 21, 29), (28, 45, 53), (33, 56, 65), (36, 77, 85), (39, 80, 89), (48, 55, 73), (65, 72, 97)

=== The existence of irrational numbers ===
One of the consequences of the Pythagorean theorem is that irrational numbers, such as the square root of 2, can be constructed. A right triangle with legs both equal to one unit has hypotenuse length square root of 2. The Pythagoreans proved that the square root of 2 is irrational, and this proof has come down to us even though it flew in the face of their cherished belief that everything was rational. According to the legend, Hippasus, who first proved the irrationality of the square root of two, was drowned at sea as a consequence.

=== Distance in Cartesian coordinates ===
The distance formula in Cartesian coordinates is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. If (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) are points in the plane, then the distance between them, also called the Euclidean distance, is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{(x_1-x_0)^2 + (y_1-y_0)^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

More generally, in Euclidean ''n''-space, the Euclidean distance between two points, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A\,=\,(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle B\,=\,(b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n)&lt;/math&gt;, is defined, using the Pythagorean theorem, as:

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{(a_1-b_1)^2 + (a_2-b_2)^2 + \cdots + (a_n-b_n)^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (a_i-b_i)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Pierre de Fermat.jpg|thumb|right|Pierre de Fermat's conjecture written in the margin of his copy of ''Arithmetica'' proved to be one of the most intriguing and enigmatic mathematical problems ever devised.]]

Fermat's Last Theorem is the name of the statement in number theory that:

: It is impossible to separate any power higher than the second into two like powers, 
or, more precisely:

: If an integer n is greater than 2, then the equation &lt;math&gt;a^n + b^n = c^n&lt;/math&gt; has no solutions in non-zero integers a, b, and c. 
In 1637, Pierre de Fermat wrote, in his copy of Claude-Gaspar Bachet's translation of the famous Arithmetica of Diophantus, &quot;I have a truly marvellous proof of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.&quot; (Original Latin: &quot;Cuius rei demonstrationem mirabilem sane detexi. Hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet.&quot;)

Fermat's Last Theorem is strikingly different and much more difficult to prove than the analogous problem for n = 2, for which there are infinitely many integer solutions called Pythagorean triples (and the closely related Pythagorean theorem has many elementary proofs). The fact that the problem's statement is understandable by schoolchildren makes it all the more frustrating, and it has probably generated more incorrect proofs than any other problem in the history of mathematics. No correct proof was found for 357 years, until one was finally published by Andrew Wiles in 1995. The term &quot;Last Theorem&quot; resulted because all the other theorems and results proposed by Fermat were eventually proved or disproved, either by his own proofs or by those of other mathematicians, in the two centuries following their proposition. Although it is a theorem now that it has been proved, the status of Fermat's Last Theorem before then, in spite of the name, was that of a conjecture, a mathematical statement whose status (true or false) has not been conclusively settled.

Fermat's Last Theorem is the most famous solved problem in the history of mathematics, familiar to all mathematicians, and had achieved a recognizable status in popular culture prior to its proof. The avalanche of media coverage generated by the resolution of Fermat's Last Theorem was the first of its kind, including worldwide newspaper accounts and various popularizations in books and a BBC Horizon programme (which aired in the United States as a PBS NOVA special, The Proof).

==History of the proof==

[[Image:Leonhard Euler.jpg|thumb|Leonhard Euler by Emanuel Handmann.]]
 
A special case of Fermat's Last Theorem for n = 3 was first stated by Abu Mahmud Khujandi in the 10th century, but his attempted proof of the theorem was incorrect.

The first case of Fermat's Last Theorem to be proven, by Fermat himself, was the case n = 4 using the method of infinite descent. Using a similar method, Leonhard Euler proved the theorem for n = 3; although his published proof contains some errors, the needed assertions could be established with work Euler himself had proven elsewhere. While his original method contained a flaw, it generated a great deal of research about the theorem. Over the following centuries, the theorem was established for many other special exponents n (or classes of exponents), but the general case remained elusive.

The case n = 5 was proved by Dirichlet and Legendre in 1825 using a generalization of Euler's proof for n = 3. The proof for the next prime number (it is enough to prove the theorem for prime numbers: see below), n = 7 was found 15 years later by Gabriel Lamé in 1839. Unfortunately, this demonstration was relatively long and unlikely to be generalized to higher numbers. From this point, mathematicians started to demonstrate the theorem for classes of exponents, instead of individual numbers, and develop more general results related to the theorem.

These general ideas can be traced back to a novel approach introduced by Sophie Germain. Rather than proving that there were no solutions to a given value n, she demonstrated that if there were a solution, a certain condition would have to apply. This insight was already used in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for the case n = 5. In 1847, Kummer proved that the theorem was true for all regular prime numbers (which include all prime numbers between 2 and 100 except for 37, 59 and 67).

In 1823 and then in 1850, the French Academy of Sciences offered a prize for a correct proof. This initiative caused only a wave of thousands of mathematical misadventures. A third prize was offered in 1883 by the Academy of Brussels. In 1908, the German industrialist and amateur mathematician Paul Friedrich Wolfskehl bequeathed 100,000 marks to the Göttingen Academy of Sciences to be offered as a prize for a complete proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. As a result, a flood of over 1000 incorrect proofs were presented between 1908 and 1911. According to mathematical historian Howard Eves:

''Fermat's Last Theorem, has the peculiar distinction of being the mathematical problem for which the greatest number of incorrect proofs have been published''.

== Elliptic curves and Wiles' proof==
[[Image:Andrew wiles1-3.jpg|thumb|left|Andrew Wiles]]
The history of the correct proof of Fermat's Last Theorem begins in the late 1960s, when Yves Hellegouarch came up with an idea of associating to any solution (a,b,c) of Fermat's equation a completely different mathematical object: an elliptic curve. The curve consists of all points in the plane whose coordinates (x,y) satisfy the relation

: &lt;math&gt; y^2=x(x-a^p)(x+b^p).&lt;/math&gt;

Such an elliptic curve would enjoy very special properties, which are due to the appearance of high powers of integers in its equation and the fact that &lt;math&gt;a^p + b^p = c^p&lt;/math&gt; is a ''p''th power as well.

Gerhard Frey had an insight that such a curve would be so special that it would contradict a certain conjecture about elliptic curves which is now called the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture. This conjecture says that each elliptic curve with rational coefficients can be constructed in an entirely different way, not by giving its equation but by using modular functions to parametrize coordinates x and y of the points on it. Thus, according to the conjecture, any elliptic curve over Q would have to be a modular elliptic curve, yet if a solution to Fermat's equation with non-zero a, b, c and p greater than 2 existed, the corresponding curve would not be modular, resulting in a contradiction. The link between Fermat's Last Theorem and the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture is a little subtle: in order to derive the former from the latter, one needs to know a bit more, or as mathematicians would have it, &quot;an epsilon more&quot;. This extra piece of information was identified by Jean-Pierre Serre and became known as the epsilon conjecture. Serre's main interest was in an even more ambitious conjecture, Serre's conjecture on modular Galois representations, which would imply the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture. Although in the preceding twenty or thirty years a lot of evidence had been accumulated to form conjectures about elliptic curves, the main reason to believe that these various conjectures were true lay not in the numerical confirmations, but in a remarkably coherent and attractive mathematical picture that they presented. Moreover, it could have happened that one or more of these conjectures were actually false (for example, Serre's conjecture is still wide open), and yet Fermat's Last Theorem were nonetheless true. That would simply mean that a different approach would be necessary.

In the summer of 1986, Ken Ribet succeeded in proving the epsilon conjecture. (His article was published in 1990.) He demonstrated that, just as Frey had anticipated, a special case of the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture (still unproven at the time), together with the now proven epsilon conjecture, implies Fermat's Last Theorem. Thus, if the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture holds for a class of elliptic curves called semistable elliptic curves, then Fermat's Last Theorem would be true.

After learning about Ribet's work, Andrew Wiles set out to prove that every semistable elliptic curve is modular. He did so in almost complete secrecy, working for a full seven years with minimal outside help. Over the course of three lectures delivered at Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences on June 21, 22, and 23 of 1993, Wiles announced his proof of the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, and hence of the Fermat's Last Theorem. Wiles drew upon a wide variety of methods in the proof, some of them having been developed especially for this occasion.

Although Wiles had reviewed his argument beforehand with a Princeton colleague, Nick Katz, he soon discovered that the proof contained a gap. There was an error in a critical portion of the proof which gave a bound for the order of a particular group. Wiles and his former student Richard Taylor spent almost a year trying to repair the proof, under the close scrutiny of the media and the mathematical community. In September 1994, they were able to complete the proof by using a very novel approach in the troublesome part of the argument. Taylor and others would go on to prove the general form of the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, now frequently called the modularity theorem, which applies to all elliptic curves over Q, not just the semistable curves that were relevant for the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.

Taylor and Wiles's proof is extremely technical in that it relies on the mathematical techniques developed in the twentieth century, most of which would be totally alien to mathematicians who had worked on Fermat's Last Theorem only a century earlier. Fermat's alleged &quot;marvellous proof&quot;, on the other hand, would have had to be fairly elementary, given the state of the mathematical knowledge at the time. And in fact, most mathematicians and science historians doubt that Fermat had a valid proof of his theorem for all exponents n.

While Wiles' proof is certainly valid, historians have concluded that it is not the same proof that Fermat derived, for several reasons. First, the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture had obviously not been discovered and the connection between modular forms and elliptic curves had not yet been noticed. While Fermat wrote that &quot;I have discovered a truly marvellous proof of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain&quot;, it couldn't have been as long as Wiles' proof, which was hundreds of pages.

==Mathematics of the proof==
Much of the background material needed to understand the proof is still not freely available. The proof of the theorem with a few persisting gaps can be found here[http://www.ams.org/notices/199507/faltings.pdf].

== Page Title ==

More of a word list or glossary really, but Dictionary is probably better for typical searches. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 23:37, 20 November 2009 (UTC)

== Choice of Vocabulary ==

A good deal of basic French vocab is included here with the football terminology. This is because this word list is intended to cover all the vocabulary used in the lesson texts in the book. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 23:37, 20 November 2009 (UTC)

== Checking Definitions ==

One way of checking the definitions here is to do an internet search on both the French word and the English one to find other web pages where they appear close together. Some of these web pages are other online dictionaries. 

There are links to other sources of information [[French_For_Football/Notes/Useful_Links |here]].

{{Wikipedia|Antennas}}

The purpose of an antenna is to collect and convert electromagnetic waves to electronic signals. Transmission lines then guide these to the receiver front end.

The relevant electric fields associated with an antenna are extremely complex and have the general form:

:::&lt;math&gt;E = j30\beta ^2 Idz\left( {\frac{j}{{\beta r}} + \frac{1}{{\left( {\beta r} \right)^2 }} + \frac{1}{{\left( {\beta r} \right)^3 }}} \right)\sin \theta e^{ - j\beta r}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Idz'' = moment of differential current element in rms amp meters
::&lt;math&gt;\beta  = \frac{{2\pi }}{\lambda }&lt;/math&gt;
::''r'' = distance in meters

The near field or Fresnel region consists of three fields. 

The electrostatic (''1/r&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'') and inductive (''1/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'') fields fall off in intensity quite quickly. The far field or Fraunhoffer region consists entirely of the (''j/r'') radiated field. This article will only consider this radiated field.

Although most antennas are simply a piece of bent wire, their interaction with electromagnetic fields is quite complex, and a whole array of terms is needed to characterize them:

::*''Beamwidth'': the angle defines by the radiation pattern where the signal strength drops 3 dB of its maximum value in a given plane.
::*''Polarization'': the plane of electric field polarization with respect to the earth.
::*''Gain'': a figure of merit used to quantify the signal capturing ability of the antenna. It is closely related to directivity and beamwidth.
::*''Effective area'': a measure of the antenna’s ability to collect energy. It is related to gain by the expression: &lt;math&gt;A = \frac{{G\lambda ^2 }}{{4\pi }}&lt;/math&gt;.
::*''Input impedance'': The impedance, which is necessary in the receiver for maximum power transfer to occur.
::*''Radiation resistance'': the ratio of the power driving the antenna to the square of the current driving its terminals.
::*''Bandwidth'': the usable frequency band associated with the antenna.

Before any antenna can be selected, the center frequency and operating bandwidth must be known. In general, the higher the operating frequency, the smaller the antenna. Antenna gain is always measured against a known reference such as an isotropic source (''dBi'') or a half wave dipole (''dBd'').

|}

Increasing antenna gain by 3 dB generally requires increasing the size by a factor of 2-3 or by reducing the beamwidth. Vertical omni directional antennas and collinear arrays are used for line-of-sight communications with ground based mobile units. Sectoring can be accomplished by panel antennas. Fixed point-to-point links generally use a yagi or parabolic dish.

Antennas exhibit reciprocity, which means they have the same gain whether used for transmitting or receiving.


===Isotropic Radiators===

An isotropic source radiates energy equally well in all directions. Stars are isotropic radiators. Our sun is an extremely powerful radiator, broadcasting 64 Megawatts per square meter of surface.
Although it is not possible to construct isotropic radio antennas, the concept provides useful analytical tools.

The power density as a function of distance from an isotropic source is easily calculated. It is simply the total energy broadcast, divided by the area it passes through, in this case, a sphere.

:::&lt;math&gt; P_{DI}  = \frac{{P_t }}{{4\pi r^2 }}&lt;/math&gt;  watts/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Isotropic gain is also called absolute gain. Antennas gains with respect to isotropic gain are specified in units of dBi. Antenna gains can also be specified with respect to a half wave dipole or a short vertical antenna. The gain of a half-wave dipole is 1.64 dBi, and that of a dipole is 2.15 dBi.

===Non Isotropic Radiators===

Virtually all types of antennas are non-isotropic sources. That is that they tend to radiate more energy in a particular direction.

:::[[Image:non_isotropic_radiator.gif]]

Because of this non-uniform energy distribution, the antenna appears to have a gain (''G&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'') (if broadcasting the same power) relative to an isotropic radiator along its principal axis and a loss in other most directions. The power density along the antenna axis is given by:

:::&lt;math&gt; P_D  = \frac{{P_t G_t }}{{4\pi r^2 }}&lt;/math&gt; watts/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

The receiving antenna attempts to collect this radiated energy through an effective area (''A&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;''). The received power is therefore:

:::&lt;math&gt; P_r  = \frac{{P_t G_t }}{{4\pi r^2 }}A_{eff} &lt;/math&gt; watts


It would seem reasonable to conclude that the effective area is simply the physical size of the antenna. Fortunately, this is not the case, and very small antennas are possible.

It has been determined that there is a relationship between effective area, transmitted wavelength and antenna gain:

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{A_{eff} }}{{G_r }} = \frac{{\lambda ^2 }}{{4\pi }}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the received power can be expressed as:

::: &lt;math&gt;P_r  = P_t G_t G_r \left( {\frac{\lambda }{{4\pi r}}} \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt; watts

Recall that: &lt;math&gt;\lambda  = \frac{c}{f}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''f'' is expressed in MHz, ''c'' in meters per second, and ''r'' in km, then the received power in dB can be expressed as:

:::&lt;math&gt; P_r  = P_t  + G_t  + G_r  - \left( {32.45 + 20\log r + 20\log f} \right)&lt;/math&gt; dB

===Electric Field Strength===

If the power density of an electromagnetic wave is known, the field strength can be obtained from:

:::&lt;math&gt; E = \sqrt {Z_0 P_D } &lt;/math&gt;

where:

:::&lt;math&gt; Z_0  = \sqrt {\frac{\mu }{\varepsilon }}  = \sqrt {\frac{{4\pi  \times 10^{ - 7} }}{{8.854 \times 10^{ - 12} }}}  = 120\pi &lt;/math&gt; (for free space)

Therefore the field strength at one meter is:

:::&lt;math&gt; E_o  = \sqrt {120\pi \frac{{P_t G_t }}{{4\pi r^2 }}}  = \sqrt {30P_t G_t } &lt;/math&gt; volts/m

==Antenna Types==

{{Wikipedia|Radio_frequency_antenna_types}}

Antennas come in a bewildering array of shapes and sizes however, they can be divided into two broad categories : Marconi and Hertzian.

Marconi antennas are electrically unbalanced and a require a ground plane. Hertzian antennas are electrically balanced and do not require a ground plane. Depending on one's point of view, it is possible to consider one type the subset of the other. This will become clearer later on.

==Marconi Antenna==

Marconi antennas are usually 1/4 wavelength long and require a path to ground. The ground plane itself acts as a reflector of energy, and combines with the directly radiated wave to create the overall radiation pattern. If the ground is dry or otherwise a poor conductor, a copper grid is generally laid out on the ground. The impedance of a 1/4 &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; Marconi antenna is 36.6 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

:::[[Image:1 4 wave marconi antenna.gif]] [[Image:Antenna, monopole.JPG|100 px]]

Notice that a Marconi antenna could be considered as a dipole antenna with one of the poles buried in the ground. The ground acts as a reflector to create the appearance of an buried antenna in the same way that a mirror creates the appearance of someone behind the glass.  Increasing the antenna length has a significant impact on the radiation pattern:

:::[[Image:Marconi antennas.gif]]

===Helical Antenna===

{{Wikipedia|Helical_antenna}}

Most Marconi antennas operate in the broadside mode, which means that the bulk of the signal radiates off the side of the wire. However it is possible to modify the antenna to operate in the end fire mode:

::[[Image:Helical antenna principle.png]]

==Hertzian Antenna==

Hertzian antennas do not require a path to either ground or a ground plane. The simplest antenna of this type is the elementary doublet. It is a hypothetical antenna where the instantaneous current magnitude is constant along its length.

:::[[Image:elementary doublet.gif]]

The radiation pattern for this antenna is donut shaped, with the antenna rod running through the hole. The bulk of the energy is radiated at right angles to the rod and nothing off the ends.

:::[[Image:doublet radiation pattern.gif]]

This antenna is often used as a reference instead of an isotropic radiator, since close approximations of it can be constructed. Other antennas can be considered as being composed of a series of doublets.

The field strength at any distance and angle can be calculated from:

:::&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{{60\pi LI}}{{\lambda r}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where

::::''L'' = doublet length in meters
::::&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;= wavelength in meters
::::''I'' = current in amps (rms)
::::''r'' = distance in meters

===Dipole Antenna===

{{Wikipedia|Dipole_antenna}}

A dipole is sometimes referred to as a Hertzian dipole. Since it has a relatively simple construction and its radiation characteristics are well defined, it is often used as the standard to which all other antennas are compared.

The dipole radiation pattern is shaped like a slightly flattened donut.

:::[[Image:dipole pattern.gif]]

The simplest antenna is the dipole. The relationship between antenna current and electric field is given by:

:::&lt;math&gt;E_\theta   = j\eta \frac{{e^{ - j\beta r} }}{{2\pi r}}I\frac{{\cos \left( {\frac{{\beta L\cos \theta }}{2}} \right) - \cos \left( {\frac{{\beta L}}{2}} \right)}}{{\sin \theta }}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

::::''E'' = electric field strength
::::&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; = angle from antenna axis (in radians)
::::''I'' = antenna current (rms)
::::&lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; = intrinsic impedance (377 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;)
::::''L'' = antenna length
::::''r'' = distance

A ½ &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; dipole has an impedance of about 70 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. To increase this impedance and more closely match the characteristics of a twin lead cable, the dipole may be folded. A ½ &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; folded dipole has an input impedance of about 280 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, and is used as the driving element in many other types of antennas.

Most TV receivers are equipped with two indoor antennas, one to cover the VHF band and the other the UHF band. The most common VHF antennas are the extendible monopole and vee dipole colloquially known as the rabbit ears. These are available with either a 75 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; or 300 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; impedance and have a typical gain of -4 dB with respect to a ½ &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; dipole. The vee dipole has a lower input impedance than a straight dipole of the same length, but under some conditions, it can exhibit a higher directivity due to the reduction of sidelobes.

The common UHF antennas are the circular loop and triangular dipole. They typically have a 300 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; impedance. The dipole version sometimes has a reflecting screen to improve the gain and directivity.

===Halfwave Dipole===

The radiation pattern of the half wave dipole is very much like a donut.

::[[Image:half wave dipole pattern.gif]]

The distribution of voltage, current, and impedance resemble:

::::[[Image:half wave dipole current.gif]]

By increasing the length of the dipole, the donut tends to flatten out and then explodes into complex multi lobed shapes.

===Folded Dipole===

::[[Image:Antenna-folded-dipole-diagram.png]]
folded dipole antenna has high input impedance as compared to ordinary dipole.

===Loop Antenna===

{{Wikipedia|Loop_antenna}}

The entire UHF band can be received on a single 20.3 cm diameter loop. The circumference varies from one wavelength at 470 MHz to 1.7 wavelengths at 806 MHz. The directivity is about 3.5 dB. The mid band gain is 3 dB higher than a ½ &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; dipole, but falls off to about 1 dB at either end.

:::[[Image:loop antenna.gif]]

Loop antennas that are much smaller than wavelength they are attempting to catch, exhibit a null in the direction of the loop axis. This makes it suitable for radio direction finding equipment. If the loop size is increased, it begins to generate a lobe across the axis and in line with the feed.

===Triangular Dipole (Bowtie)===

::[[Image:bow tie antenna.gif]]

The bowtie antenna is formed of two triangular sheets connected to a transmission line and provides a 3 dB gain over a simple dipole. It can also be constructed of a wire mesh if the spacing is less than 1/10 wavelength. The
input impedance is a function of length and flare angle. For television applications, the flare angle a is between 60&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; and 80&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;. If the antenna is mounted ¼ &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in front of a reflecting surface, the gain increases to approximately 9 dB. Stacking two of them vertically one wavelength apart, increases the overall gain to about 12 dB.

If the receiver is located at a great distance from the broadcast tower, it is often necessary to use an outdoor antenna. These often have a gain of 15 dB. Placing the antenna on a tall mast also increases the received signal strength by as much as an additional 14 dB. A further improvement occurs because these antennas have a greater immunity to interference, due to their complex structure.

Most outdoor antennas are a combination of two antennas [UHF and VHF] in a single structure. The VHF antenna is generally a log-periodic dipole array. The UHF antenna may be an LPDA, Yagi-Uda, corner reflector, parabolic reflector, or triangular dipole array with reflecting screen.

===Log Periodic Dipole Array [LPDA]===

{{Wikipedia|LPDA}}

This antenna is called a log periodic array because the impedance variations across the usable band are periodic functions of frequency. The high impedance version is mounted on an insulated boom and feed by a balanced cable. The average domestic antenna of this type has a gain of about 4.5 dB in the low VHF band, rising to 7 dB in the high VHF band.

::[[Image:log periodic antenna.gif]]

::::&lt;math&gt;\tau  = \frac{{X_n }}{{X_{n + 1} }} = \frac{{L_n }}{{L_{n + 1} }} = \frac{{s_n }}{{s_{_{n + 1} } }} = \frac{{d_n }}{{d_{n + 1} }}&lt;/math&gt;   -- Typically &lt;math&gt;0.7 \le \tau  \le 0.95&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;\alpha  = \tan ^{ - 1} \left( {\frac{{1 - \tau }}{{4\sigma }}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;    -- Typically &lt;math&gt;10^0  \le \alpha  \le 45^0 &lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;\sigma  = \frac{{d_n }}{{2L_n }}&lt;/math&gt;

::Bandwidth: &lt;math&gt;B = \frac{{f_{high} }}{{f_{low} }}\left( {1 + 7.7\left( {1 - \tau } \right)^2 \cot \alpha } \right)&lt;/math&gt;

::Number of dipoles: &lt;math&gt;N = 1 + \frac{{\ln B}}{{\ln \frac{1}{\tau }}}&lt;/math&gt;

Most CATV applications use a 75 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; unbalanced configuration, because it is more compatible with their cable feeds and equipment.

::[[Image:unbalanced coax feed.gif]]

Two parallel conducting booms form a low impedance transmission line. Phase reversal between dipoles is obtained by alternate attachment to the booms.

An UHF LPDA can be constructed from V-shaped dipoles. The dipoles are used in their ½ &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and 3/2 &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; modes and eliminate the need for higher frequency dipoles.

===Yagi Uda Antenna===

{{Wikipedia|Yagi_antenna}}

::[[Image:yagi.gif]]

The dipole is typically 0.40 to 0.50 wavelengths long. The reflector is normally 0.55 wavelengths long and placed anywhere from 0.1 to 0.25 wavelengths behind the dipole. The reflector spacing has no effect on the forward gain, but does influence the front to back ratio and input impedance.

The directors are normally 0.4 to 0.45 wavelengths long and are spaced at 0.3 to 0.4 wavelengths in front of the dipole. An antenna will usually have 6 to 12 directors.

===Parabolic Reflector===

{{Wikipedia|Parabolic_antenna}}

::[[Image:Arecibo naic big.gif|300 px]]

==Antenna Arrays==

By combining several radiating elements together, the overall radiation pattern can be modified to suit a particular application. In some cases the antennas must be manually steered, but in other cases they can be electronically steered using phase shifting between elements.

::[[Image:Kreuzdipolarp.jpg|200 px]]  [[Image:PAVE_PAWS_Radar_Clear_AFS_Alaska.jpg|200px]]

The array factor is the increase in field strength in an array when compared to a single element radiating the same power:

::[[Image:Array_side_view.gif]]

::::&lt;math&gt;AF = \left| {\frac{{\sin \left( {\frac{{n\varphi }}{2}} \right)}}{{\sqrt n \sin \left( {\frac{\varphi }{2}} \right)}}} \right| \vdots \quad \quad \quad AF_{\max }  = \sqrt n &lt;/math&gt;

::Where:

::::&lt;math&gt;\varphi  = \frac{{2\pi }}{\lambda }s\cos \left( \theta  \right) + \alpha &lt;/math&gt;
:::::= phase difference between radiated fields from adjacent elements
::::''n'' = number of radiating elements
::::''s'' = element spacing in wavelengths
::::&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; = current phase shift between elements
::::&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; = angle from array axis

===Broadside Array===

If all of the elements are fed in-phase, there will always be a broadside radiation pattern. However, depending on the relative spacing, an end fire pattern can also be created.

::[[Image:Broadside_wavefront.gif]]

The radiating elements in the above illustration can be placed such that they reinforce one another along the array axis, or not. An end fire pattern is recreated when they reinforce.

By varying the space or phase shift between the elements, the size and direction of the side lobes can be adjusted between these two extremes. Increasing the number of radiating elements increases the overall array gain.

::[[Image:Array_factor_1.gif]]

Determining the array factor is sometimes relatively straightforward. By definition, the signal strength for a broadside array is a maximum when  &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; = 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; and a minimum when &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; = 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;

Since the array factor is a maximum when &lt;math&gt;\varphi &lt;/math&gt; = 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; we can determine the current phase shift &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, required to create a broadside radiation pattern for a given frequency or element spacing:

::::&lt;math&gt;\varphi  = \frac{{2\pi }}{\lambda }s\cos \left( \theta  \right) + \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;0 = \frac{{2\pi }}{\lambda }s\cos \left( \theta  \right) + \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;\alpha  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

::Therefore the array factor for a broadside array is:

::::&lt;math&gt;AF = \left| {\frac{{\sin \left( {\frac{{n\varphi }}{2}} \right)}}{{\sqrt n \sin \left( {\frac{\varphi }{2}} \right)}}} \right|\quad {\rm{where}}\quad \varphi  = \frac{{2\pi }}{\lambda }s\cos \left( \theta  \right)&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;{\rm{generally}}\quad s = \frac{\lambda }{2}\quad \quad \quad {\rm{therefore}}\quad \quad \quad \varphi  = 2cos\left( \theta  \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Each element may have its own feed or there may be a single feed:

::[[Image:Broadside_feed.gif]]

This form of antenna is often deployed in vertical stacks, with a reflector spaced 1/4 wavelength behind the curtain. This broadband dipole curtain array is the standard antenna for 100 to 500 kW short-wave broadcasting stations.

::[[Image:Broadside_array.gif]]

CBC Radio International operates eight curtain arrays at Sackville NB. Three have an output power of 100 kW and five have an output of 250 kW. They are tunable over the range of 4.9 to 21.7 MHz. Signals are beamed to Africa, Europe, Latin America, The Caribbean, the USA, and Mexico.

===Endfire Array===

If all of the elements are positioned in such a way that the combined wave fronts reinforce along the array axis.

::[[Image:Endfire.gif]]

Calculate the array factor is relatively straightforward. The signal strength is a maximum when &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; = 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; and a minimum when &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;  = 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;

Since the array factor is a maximum when &lt;math&gt;\varphi &lt;/math&gt; = 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; we can determine the value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;:

::::&lt;math&gt;\varphi  = \frac{{2\pi }}{\lambda }s\cos \left( \theta  \right) + \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;0 = \frac{{2\pi }}{\lambda }s\cos \left( 0 \right) + \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;\alpha  =  - \frac{{2\pi }}{\lambda }s&lt;/math&gt;

::The array factor for an end fire array is:

::::&lt;math&gt;AF = \left| {\frac{{\sin \left( {\frac{{n\varphi }}{2}} \right)}}{{\sqrt n \sin \left( {\frac{\varphi }{2}} \right)}}} \right|\quad {\rm{where}}\quad \varphi  = \frac{{2\pi }}{\lambda }s\left( {\cos \left( \theta  \right) - 1} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

::::&lt;math&gt;{\rm{generally}}\quad s = \frac{\lambda }{4}\quad \quad \quad {\rm{therefore}}\quad \quad \quad \varphi  = \frac{\pi }{2}\left( {cos\left( \theta  \right) - 1} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


Varying the spacing for a 6-element array produced the following patterns:

::[[Image:Broadside_patterns.gif]]

===Phased Array===

By varying the phase shift between elements, a beam or multiple beams can be pointed towards a given direction. This forms the basis of the large electronically steered radar system currently being deployed. Collectively theses systems are known as phased arrays.

::[[Image:Phased_pattern.gif|300 px]]

The PAVE PAWS early warning radar for example has 1792 active crossed dipole antennas on a 102-foot face. Each face can scan 120&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; in azimuth and 80&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; in elevation. The array has a range of 300 miles and can produce multiple beams, which can be redirected in milliseconds.

Completely changed this sentence since it is both incorrect and not detailed enough, &quot;All builds of Mac OS X (OS X) are built on top of a BSD base (using FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD), the Mach microkernel, and core system services.

== deletion of my own copyrighted fotos ==

To whom it may concern...

I am trying to write a wikiBook
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computers_%26_Society

This is NOT my full-time job.
Therefore, I do not check in every day.

I only use my own photographs.

A recent one of a horse, taken in Koprivshtitsa, has been deleted.
I should like it to be uindeleted asap.

: The user seems to have [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MihalOrela&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1224231 sorted this out]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 11:22, 6 July 2008 (UTC)
:::In the future, be sure to put a license on any photo you upload. If it does not have a license after 7 days, it will be deleted. I would suggest using the commons instead of uploading on here, because it makes the pictures availible to all projects and frankly I find it much easier to do that.

== Possible vandalism ==

[[Special:Contributions/202.136.26.154|This]] looks like vandalism. I didn't act on it as I don't know much about that topic and can't be sure whether the edit is constructive or not.

I request someone to look over this. Thanks.

== Proper licensing of an essay ==

I recently came across [[Principles_of_Sociology/Traveling_Kids|this essay]]. Thinking it looked suspicious, I did a quick Google search, and found out it was the same as [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/che725/teaching/travelingkids.htm this page]. At first, I had marked it as a copyvio, but I quickly figured out it must have been posted by [[User:Alexevasion|Alexevasion]] (Alex Goldman), who is the author. Unfortunately, there's no history of [[User:Alexevasion|Alexevasion]] having posted it; maybe he did it before he got his account?

Anyway, I wanted to make sure that nobody else made my mistake, and took it for a copyvio and deleted it. What's the proper way for [[User:Alexevasion|Alexevasion]] to license this? I was going to contact him and help him fix it.
[[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] ([[User talk:PurplePieman|talk]]) 18:44, 19 July 2008 (UTC)

:If he actually is the author, he doesn't technically need to ''do'' anything to license it for us. However, for bookkeeping and to avoid license paranoia, it would help if he made a small note somewhere about how he is, indeed, the original author and that he is explicitly licensing it under the GFDL. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]])
:Actually, it's be much better if he would send a confirmation email from any email associated with the domain clas.ufl.edu to {{email|permissions-en|wikimedia.org}} stating it is licensed under the GFDL. This allows us to confirm and archive such permissions centrally. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:57, 30 July 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">JosephC7 has been in the computer field since 1985. At 1993 he received his CNE from Novell and in 1994 he received his MCSE from Microsoft. He would hold the title for the youngest CNE (Age 13) and MCSE (Age 14) for some time. Since then he helped create, support or refined several ground breaking technologies such as Novell's Directory Services (NetWare Directory Services), Microsoft's Exchange 4.0, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server, Novell's UnixWare with Windows NT integration, GroupWare 4.x through 5.2 and many more. His task/mission for those projects varied greatly and at times he was on the fringes of those projects and witnessed 1st hand what worked and what didn't work which he later applied to his current projects. He has been developing on the Apple platform on and off through his career, 1st using AppBuilder, later using Metroworks and finally XCode. You can see some of the projects his is involved in at [http://www.aquaconnect.net Aqua Connect Inc.]'s company website.</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]].

This template is used to list hiragana and katakana.

== Usage ==
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Japanese kana
 | kana     =
 | image    =
 | sound    =
 | mnemonic =
 | example  =
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Only the &lt;code&gt;kana&lt;/code&gt; variable is required. The &lt;code&gt;kana&lt;/code&gt; variable automatically picks a stroke order diagram. This can be overridden with the &lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; variable.

There are extra variables for the voiced and plosive characters:
&lt;pre&gt;
 | voiced          =
 | voiced_sound    =
 | voiced_mnemonic =
 | voiced_example  =
 | plosive          =
 | plosive_sound    =
 | plosive_mnemonic =
 | plosive_example  =
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Example ==
{|
! MediaWiki syntax !! Displays as

| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; |&lt;pre&gt;{{Japanese kana
 | kana    = あ
 | sound   = '''a'''
 | mnemonic= '''Apple'''. It's an apple.
First you draw the leaves on the stem,
then you draw the stem down into the

 | example =

* あか (aka) red
* あき (aki) autumn
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Computer technology was born out of a community of collaboration and knowledge sharing. In the early 1980s the practice of sharing efforts and ideas was losing momentum. Richard Stallman, taking the initiative to restore the culture he endeared, founded the GNU Project and Free Software Foundation.

GNU and FSF are cornerstones of modern Copyleft. Copyleft intends to remind persons of freedoms which Copyright takes away and allow them to share these liberties with others. Software Libre is so named to remind us of the distinction between financially free (gratis) and freedoms, which are granted (libre.)

'''License Choice'''

Most software users receive comes packaged under various EULAs [End-User License Agreements.] All of these applications are released under the GNU's Not Unix General Public License. The GNU GPL is a liberating license designed [and recently re-designed] to promote software freedom. The freedoms at stake are individuals' ability to access software, examine it's structure, modify the structure to suit one's needs and give a copy of [or redistribute] the software to a friend or person in need.

It is a principal of GNUmedia to promote, first and foremost, licenses which preserve the freedoms which they allow.

Those of you familiar with OSS [Open Source Software] and OSS licenses might wonder why GNUmedia is not promoting software, on this page, which is released under other licenses - even GPL compatible licenses.

This template adds a box with links to related vocabulary, lessons and other content. It helps tie pages together in a non-linear way to increase the flexibility of the [[Japanese]] book and reduce the duplication of content such as vocabulary links by providing a handy link for easy access (e.g. to help them create their own sentences during excercises).

A lesson including self-introduction could, for example, have links to [[Japanese/Vocabulary/Family and people]] and [[Japanese/Vocabulary/Countries, languages and nationalities]].

== Usage ==
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Japanese related|&lt;type&gt;|
&lt;add links here&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;&lt;type&gt;&lt;/code&gt; variable is used to change the colour of the links box. It specifically recognises
* &lt;code&gt;vocabulary&lt;/code&gt;,
* &lt;code&gt;lesson&lt;/code&gt;, and
* &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt;
and formats these specially.

== Example ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

I have added some Punjabi words to [[Punjabi/Writing lessons plan]] containing ਬ, ਪ and ਤ some of them ending with ਪ and ਤ.

Jaspal Singh 07:45, 4 August 2008 (UTC)


:Thank you.

Great job Yoshiro! Keep it up. Jaspal Singh 15:46, 5 August 2008 (UTC)

== Need more words:  ਖ਼ and ਦ ==

I need more words please:

beginning with, containing, and ending with ਖ਼, and
beginning with, containing, and ending with ਦ.

Thanks.

[[User:YoshiroShin|YoshiroShin]] ([[User talk:YoshiroShin|talk]]) 03:22, 6 August 2008 (UTC)


:Please see if the newally added words at [[Punjabi/Writing lessons plan]] suffice?
:Jaspal Singh 17:40, 6 August 2008 (UTC)


I just need two more words ending in ਦ.  Try not to have ਊ, ਆ, ਦ, ਡ, or ਜ਼ right before ਦ or else it wont work, and there can't be a vowel after it either.
  
I also need two more medial ਖ਼ words and two end ਖ਼ words with the same rules applying.

Sorry for being so much trouble.

:Added some more words at [[Punjabi/Writing lessons plan]]. I am glad you are taking lots of pains to help complete the book. Regards.  Jaspal Singh 16:10, 7 August 2008 (UTC)


::Hi Yoshiro, there is some great news on WIKIBOOKS NEWS at http://wikibooks.blogspot.com/2008/08/punjabi.html. I am happy others are so appreciative. Jaspal Singh 06:40, 9 August 2008 (UTC)


:Yeah, that's cool, but I was hoping to be able to finish the lessons before having them added onto and augmented by other users or else it'll get a little confusing.

::I have put some Punjabi words on sundry pages of the [[Punjabi/Vocabulary]] module. Please see if that can be of some use for Shahmukhi examples. Regards.  Jaspal Singh 14:30, 20 August 2008 (UTC)


Yeah, I think I'm gonna have less time to work on this soon so everybody is welcome to add what they want to the Shahmukhi lessons.

== Making Better Models ==
This section will deal with the actual modeling of objects and how to make better, more detailed objects much faster and more efficient. It will also deal with making more accurate models, whether it is cartoonish or realistic. Either way, this tutorial will deal with making better models and using the more advanced modeling systems in Blender.

Hi there!

Peri Coleman here, salt lake and salt marsh fanatic,  mother of salt lake fanatic, grandmother of potential salt lake fanatic - you get the picture.  


The slogan of our small, South Australian consulting company (Delta Environmental Consulting, [http://www.deltaenvironmental.com.au]) is: ''Wet, salty, muddy, arid?  Our element...''  And that is basically what we do - we mess about in salt lakes.  So you can see where my interest in the [[Methods Manual for Salt Lake Studies]] comes from.


When I am not in a salt lake, I am probably undertaking flora surveys somewhere across Australia or processing flora vouchers for our own herbarium and the South Australian Plant Biodiversity Centre's Adelaide Herbarium.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is the people who make up the society. Here is a very small list of around 26 people
who might be said to have contributed enormously to our modern world of Computers &amp; Society.

By modern world we mean at least post 1990 up to the present 2008 and onwards. There is no doubt that people such as
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann von Neumann], 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing Turing], and so on were contributors to the discipline of Computer Science and thus directly
and/or indirectly shapers of our modern Society. But they are not to be included.
We want to list those who are still alive and contributing.

Each one listed here must have been significantly cited in this Wikibook and be still alive
to qualify for inclusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Harvard Chart Method of Logical Equation Reduction'''&lt;ref&gt;*Hunter, William L. [10-1975]. Chapter 4, &quot;The Laws of Logic, Boolean Equation Simplification - The Harvard Chart&quot;. ''Digital/Logic electronics Handbook''(in English), pp.112-113, Blue Ridge summit, PA 17214: Tab Books / No. 774, 1975. ISBN 0-8306-5774-6, ISBN 0-8306-4774-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moved from original location in Wikipedia  [[w:Harvard Chart Method of Logical Equation Reduction|Harvard Chart Method of Logical Equation Reduction]] to Wikibooks by &quot;author request, no substantial contributions by anyone else&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; was developed to address the need to automate the process of logical equation reduction in the early days of computer hardware and switching circuit development. Large scale production of computer circuitry entailed many more variables than could be reasonably handled by manual methods using [[w:Boolean logic|Boolean logic]], [[w:Venn diagrams|Venn diagrams]], etc. Automated methods of logical equation reduction were necessary to minimize logic circuits and thereby reduce the number of logic gates which used vacuum tubes as switches due to their relatively high cost and excessive thermal emission. 

The Harvard Chart Method of logical equation reduction is capable of reducing binary logical equations having five or more variables to minimum form. As the number of variables increase, the number of operations required to minimize a logical equation increases exponentially, placing practical limits on performing logical equation reduction by hand. The Harvard Chart Method was developed to solve this problem by using a computerized method to automate the process of logical reduction. The method represents one of the first instances where computers were able to assist in the design of the circuits of which they are made. Application of this method is limited only by the logical speed and size of the computer (or computer network) on which it is run. A method based on the Harvard Chart Method has since been developed to reduce multi-valued logical equations to minimum form.


=== Logical Equation Reduction, Simplification or Minimization ===

''&lt;small&gt;(note this chart uses upper case to represent the logic state of &quot;TRUE&quot;  and lower case to represent the logic state of &quot;FALSE&quot;''

Lets simplify the following equation: 

&lt;big&gt;f = ABc + ABC + aBC + aBc + AbC&lt;/big&gt;


==== The Harvard Chart (style 1) ====
[[image:Harvard_Chart.PNG]]

==== The Harvard Chart (style 2) ====

|+The Harvard Chart

|-
| A || B || C || AB || AC || BC || ABC || Row8
|}

=== The Reduction Steps ===
#Draw a line through all rows whose terms are not contained in the expression being simplified (rows 1,2 and 5).
#Starting with the left column (column 1) cross out all terms which have been lined out in step 1. (a is lined out in rows 1 and 2, and A in row 5; thus, all terms are lined out in the left column of this example.)
#In column 2 only b (lower case) is eliminated. Circle all b's for easy identification as a part of the final answer.
#Going to the right, cross out all terms containing B in all the rows with a circled B. For example, in row 4 the terms AB, BC, and aBC are lined out.
#Continue with lines 3 and 4.
#In column 5 the term AC is not crossed out, so it must be circled.
#Going to the right in rows containing AC, cross out all other terms containing AC.
#All terms in columns 6 and 7 (column BC and ABC) are now crossed out and the process ends. Only B and AC are left. 

::*Therefore the answer is: f = B + AC

It would be nice to have 26, one per letter of the alphabet. Seriously, the list ought to be short. And why not limit it to 26, arbitrarily?

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Brouwer fixed point theorem is an important fixed point theorem that applies to finite-dimensional spaces and which forms the basis for several general fixed point theorems. It is named after Dutch mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer.

== Statement ==
The theorem states that every continuous function from the closed unit ball ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''itself''' has at least one fixed point. In this theorem, ''n'' is any positive integer, and the closed unit ball ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the set of all points in Euclidean ''n''-space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; which are at distance at most 1 from the origin. 
A fixed point of a function ''f'' : ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a point ''x'' in ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that ''f''(''x'') = ''x''. 

===Notes===
The function ''f'' in this theorem is not required to be bijective or even surjective.

Because the properties involved (continuity, being a fixed point) are invariant under homeomorphisms, the theorem equally applies if the domain is not the closed unit ball itself but some set homeomorphic to it (and therefore also closed, bounded, connected, without holes, etc.).

The statement of the theorem is false if formulated for the ''open'' unit disk, the set of points with distance strictly less than 1 from the origin. Consider for example the function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = \textstyle (\frac{1}{2}(x+\sqrt{1-y^2}),y)&lt;/math&gt;
which maps every point of the open unit disk in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to another point of the open unit disk slightly to the right of the given one.

== Illustrations ==
The theorem has several &quot;real world&quot; illustrations. For example: take two sheets of graph paper of equal size with coordinate systems on them, lay one flat on the table and crumple up (without ripping or tearing) the other one and place it any fashion on top of the first so that the crumpled paper does not reach outside the flat one. There will then be at least one point of the crumpled sheet that lies exactly on top of its corresponding point (i.e. the point with the same coordinates) of the flat sheet. This is a consequence of the ''n'' = 2 case of Brouwer's theorem applied to the continuous map that assigns to the coordinates of every point of the crumpled sheet the coordinates of the point of the flat sheet immediately beneath it. 

In three dimensions the consequence of the Brouwer fixed point theorem is that no matter how much you stir or shake a cocktail in a glass some point in the liquid will remain in the exact same place in the glass as before you took any action, assuming that the final position of each point is a continuous function of its original position, and that the liquid after stirring or shaking is contained within the space originally taken up by it.

Another consequence of the case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 is given by an informational display of a map in, for example, an airport terminal. The function that sends points of the terminal to their image on the map is continuous and therefore has a fixed point, usually indicated by a cross or arrow with the text ''You are here''. A similar display outside the terminal would violate the condition that the function is &quot;to itself&quot; and fail to have a fixed point. For this example, the existence of a fixed point is also a consequence of the Banach fixed point theorem, since the function mapping points in space to the display is a contraction mapping.

==History==

The Brouwer fixed point theorem was one of the early achievements of algebraic topology, and is the basis of more general fixed point theorems which are important in functional analysis. The case n = 3 first was proved by Piers Bohl in 1904 (published in Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik). It was later proved by L. E. J. Brouwer in 1909. Jacques Hadamard proved the general case in 1910, and Brouwer found a different proof in 1912. Since these early proofs were all non-constructive indirect proofs, they ran contrary to Brouwer's intuitionist ideals. Methods to construct (approximations to) fixed points guaranteed by Brouwer's theorem are now known, however; see for example (Karamadian 1977) and (Istrăţescu 1981).

==Proof==

Assume that there does exist a map from &lt;math&gt;f:B^n\to B^n&lt;/math&gt; with no fixed point. Then let
&lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; be the following map: Start at &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, draw the ray going through &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and then let &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; be
the first intersection of that line with the sphere. This map is continuous and well defined only
because &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; fixes no point. Also, it is not hard to see that it must be the identity on the boundary
sphere. Thus we have a map &lt;math&gt;g:B^n\to S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the identity on
&lt;math&gt;S^{n-1}=\partial B^n&lt;/math&gt;, that is, a retraction. Now, if &lt;math&gt;i:S^{n-1}\to B^n&lt;/math&gt; is the inclusion
map, &lt;math&gt;g\circ i=\mathrm{id}_{S^{n-1}}&lt;/math&gt;. Applying the reduced homology functor, we find that
&lt;math&gt;g_*\circ i_*=\mathrm{id}_{\tilde{H}_{n-1}(S^{n-1})}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;_*&lt;/math&gt; indicates the induced map on homology.

But, it is a well-known fact that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}_{n-1}(B^n)=0&lt;/math&gt; (since &lt;math&gt;B^n&lt;/math&gt; is contractible), and that
&lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}_{n-1}(S^{n-1})=\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have an isomorphism of a non-zero group onto itself
factoring through a trivial group, which is clearly impossible. Thus we have a contradiction,
and no such map &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; exists.

Although there are no natlangs known to lack the noun-verb distinction, nor do I know of any conlang, it is still a theoretical possibility for a language to lack such a distinction.

One possible method of destroying the distinction would be to create a verb class similar to the present participle that would be able to act as a modifier to another verb, essentially creating a long chain of complicated verbs referencing a noun without said noun actually appearing. The noun would instead be substituted by a verb participle as the patient/actor. One consequence of this would be that the language would also lack adjectives, them having been completely replaced by adverbs.

Some possible examples could be:
*humaningly sitting falls from blocking
*~~Be.human+ADV to.sit+SUBSTANTIATIVE-MOOD to.fall+PRES from to.block+SUBSTANTIATIVE-MOOD

This, however, only blurs the boundary a little bit.

A few conlangers have attempted to build a language with only one part of speech.

In particular, the AllNoun project developed a grammer composed entirely of nouns (plus 4 punctuation symbols, which is fewer than the number of punctuation symbols in most languages).&lt;ref&gt;
Tom Breton.
[http://www.panix.com/~tehom/allnoun/allnoun.htm &quot;AllNoun: Grammar with only one part of speech.&quot;]
1995.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Other conlangers have attempted to eliminate all nouns.
One approach is to replace nouns with a series of adjectives that modify a pronoun, similar to the way Toki Pona expresses the noun &quot;soldier&quot;
with &quot;jan utala&quot; (literally &quot;fighting person&quot;) from jan (person) utala (fight) or the proper noun &quot;Lisa&quot; with &quot;jan Lisa&quot; (literally &quot;Lisa person&quot;).

== Conjuncts ==

Three consonants are used in Punjabi as conjuncts. These are half haha - ਹ੍ as in ਨ੍ਹ = ਨ+ਹ੍; half rara - ਰ੍ as in ਪ੍ਰ = ਪ+ਰ੍; and half vava - ਵ੍ as in ਸ੍ਵ = ਸ+ਵ੍. They are used only as inferior conjugates in the conjugal pair of consonants. 
The principal use of such conjuncts is in the words borrowed from other languages like Sanskrit, English etc. Here are some examples of the use of conjugate haha
:ਜਿੰਨ੍ਹਾ /jinnaa/ = whom
:ਯਗ੍ਹਾ /yaggaa/ = place
:ਵਜ੍ਹਾ /vajjaa/ = reason

In the above examples the conjugate haha is not spoken as normal haha but a low tone following the conjugate full consonant. Let us now see some illustrations of the use of conjugate rara.
:ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ /amrit/ = nectar
:ਪ੍ਰਿੰਟਰ /printar/ = printer
:ਪ੍ਰੋਫੈਸਰ /profesar/ = professor

Here are some illustrations of conjugate vava 
:ਸ੍ਵੈਮਾਨ /svemaan/ = self-respect
:ਸ੍ਵੈਜੀਵਨੀ /svejiivanii/ = auto-biography
:ਸ੍ਵੀਕਾਰ /sviikaar/ = accept

Among these conjugate consonants half vava i.e. ਵ੍ is used only with ਸ (ਸ੍ਵ).&lt;br&gt;

In the above examples where ever a lag matra is added to a conjunct the matra actually combines with the conjugate diacritic which is invariantly spoken after the full consonant.

== Exercises ==

Write three examples each of conjugate haha, rara and vava.

Punjabi is a tonal language. This implies that tone is spoken in Punjabi and its use is meaningful, that is the use of tone changes the meaning of the word. So what is tone?

== Tone ==

Tone is a high or low aspirated sound, especially of consonant ਹ. (This is not an attempt to precisely define the tone but to just familiarize the reader with the concept. A precise definition is beyond the scope of this Wikibook.)

Though tone is not written using any symbol or letter it is still spoken in Punjabi. There are many ways in which tone is spoken in Punjabi. The letter ਹ has a special significance in this context. When ਹ comes at the beginning of a word or a syllable it is spoken with its normal aspirated glottal sound. However when it comes in a word at a different place it is spoken as a high tone. See the examples below.
:• ਰਹਿ /reh/ = live
:• ਬਹਿ /beh/ = sit
:• ਸ਼ਹਿਰ /shehar/ = city
:• ਕਹਿਰ /kehar/ = atrocity
:• ਜਾਹ /jah/ = go
:• ਉਹ /uh/ = he
Besides ਹ the letters ਘ, ਝ, ਢ, ਧ and ਭ are also of special significance in the context of tone. These consonants are high tone consonants. They are spoken as their normal sounds when they occur at the beginning of a word. See for example:
:• ਘਰ /ghar/ = house
:• ਝੰਡਾ /jhandaa/ = flag
:• ਢੱਕ /&lt;u&gt;dh&lt;/u&gt;akk/ = cover
:• ਧੱਕਾ /dhakka/ = push
:• ਭਾਰ /bhaar/ = weight
However when they occur elsewhere in a word their sounds are replaced with the low tone ਗ੍ਹ, ਜ੍ਹ, ਡ੍ਹ, ਦ੍ਹ and ਬ੍ਹ. Since these conjugates are occurring at the end of the word the half haha is actually spoken as high tone. See these examples:
:• ਸਿੰਘ /singh/ = lion
:• ਬੋਝਾ /bojhaa/ = pocket
:• ਕੱਢ /kadhdh/ = take out
:• ਕੰਧ /kan&lt;u&gt;dh&lt;/u&gt;/ = wall
:• ਖੰਭ /khambh/ = feather
Here are some examples of low tone:
:• ਕਿੰਨ੍ਹਾ /kinaah/ = who
:• ਜਿੰਨ੍ਹਾ /jinaah/ = those who
:• ਨ੍ਹਾਤਾ /nhaa&lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;aa/ =bathed
:• ਪੜ੍ਹਾਈ /parhaaii/ = education
:• ਚੜ੍ਹ /charhh/ = climb

== Punjabi Language ==

Punjabi is a robust and vibrant language, as is Punjabi culture, rich in literature with traditions in folk and modern literatures alike. Though it is mother tongue of the natives of Punjab in India and Pakistan, it is spoken internationally by an estimated 100 to 125 million people. It is the official language of Indian  state of Punjab. It is also the second official language of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi states of India and the de facto sacred language of Sikhs, being the language of the Sikh scriptures and religious literature. In Pakistan though, Urdu and English are the official languages, Punjabi speakers form the single largest linguistic group.

Punjabi is spoken as a minority language in several countries, including Afghanistan. It is also spoken in many countries where Punjabis have emigrated in large numbers, such as Britain, Canada, Australia and the United States. The language finds a place of pride in many countries including Canada where it is the fourth most spoken language. Much like English, Punjabi has moved around the world and developed local forms by assimilating local vocabulary and cultures. While most borrowed words come from English, Hindi and Urdu and indirectly from Persian, Punjabi has also taken words from languages such as Spanish and Dutch. A distinctive &quot;Diaspora Punjabi&quot; is thus emerging.

Like other Northern Indian languages, Punjabi derives from Sanskrit and therefore belongs to the Indics, a branch of Indo-European family of languages. It uses the Gurmukhi script though in Pakistan a modified variant of Arabic script called Shahmukhi is used. Gurmukhi has evolved over centuries and passed through many phases from Brahmi to Landas. With a great deal of contribution from Sri Guru Angad Dev, the second Sikh Guru, it has assumed the modern day form, though it continues to evolve. Like other Indic scripts it is most scientifically ordered.

Punjabi culture much like its Bengali counterpart, suffered a split between India and Pakistan during the Partition of 1947. As such, Punjabi language and culture tend to be unifying factors for the peoples of India and Pakistan in spite of the national and religious affiliations.

==Lesson 2==

Welcome to Lesson 2.  In this lesson, you will be taught the next row: 

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ج چ ح خ د ڈ ذ  &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;


Jīm, chē, baṛī hē, and xē all change form in the same way, only differing with dot diacritics.

Likewise, dāl, ḍāl, and zāl all also change form in the same way with differing diacritics.

==A Note on Non-Connectors==

Dāl, ḍāl, and zāl are also what are called ''non-connectors''.  This means that when one of these letters occur in the beginning or the middle a word, the letter coming after the non-connector will be in its initial form.  If the non-connector is the second last letter in the word, the letter coming after it will be in its independent form.  


An example of the first instance:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ریڈیٔو &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - rēḍīō - radio

Here, rē and ḍāl are the non-connectors.  


An example of the second instance:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; رباج &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - rabāj - fashion

Here, alef is the non-connector.  


If a non-connector comes after another non-connector, it simply takes its independent form:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; درد &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - dard - pain

Here, dāl and rē are the non-connectors.  


Now on to the lesson:

==jīm - ج==

Jīm is pronounced like the English &quot;j&quot;.  It will be represented by &quot;j&quot; in romanization.  

=====Initial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; جوکر &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - jōkar - joker

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; جیل &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - jēl - jail

=====Medial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; پجاما &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - pajāmā - pajama

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; پنجاب &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - panjāb - Punjab

=====Final=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; سج &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - saj - decoration (Urdu)

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ججّ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - jajj - judge

==chē - چ==

Chē is pronounced like the English &quot;ch&quot;.  It will be represented by &quot;ch&quot; in romanization.  

=====Initial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; چین &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - chīn - China

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; چیٹا &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - chīṭā - cheetah

=====Medial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; سچل &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - sachal - Sachal (a name)

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; چیچہ وطنی &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - chīchahwatnī - Chichawatni (a town in Punjab, Pakistan)

=====Final=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; نیمچ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - nīmach - Nimach (a town in Madhya Pradesh, India)

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; پانچ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - pānch - 5 (Urdu)

==baṛī hē - ح==

Baṛī hē is pronounced like the English &quot;h&quot;.  It will be represented by &quot;h&quot; in romanization.  

=====Initial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; حیدرآباد &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - haidarābād - Hyderabad (a city in Sindh, Pakistan)

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; حلايب &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - halāīb - Hala'ib (a town in Egypt)

=====Medial/Final=====


By looking at jīm and chē, it shouldn't be difficult to determine the medial and final forms of baṛī hē.

==xē - خ==

Xē is pronounced a little like the Scottish &quot;ch&quot; or the Russian &quot;x&quot;.  It will be represented by &quot;x&quot; in romanization.  

=====Initial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; خضدار &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - xuzdār - Khuzdar (a town in Balochistan, Pakistan)

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; خرگوش &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - xargōsh - rabbit

=====Medial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; سخت &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - saxat - strict

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; مخّں &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - maxxaṇ - butter

=====Final=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; رخ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - raxx - keep

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; کخّ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - kaxx - straw

==dāl - د==

Dāl is pronounced a little like the English &quot;d&quot; however, just like the dental t, this is a dental d.  Therefore, you need to place the tip of your tongue behind your upper teeth instead of on the roof of your mouth to produce this sound.  It will be represented by &quot;d&quot; in romanization.  

=====Initial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; دوات &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - davāt - ink pot

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; دادا &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - dādā - grandfather

=====Medial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; سدا &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - sadā - always

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; سدّ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - sadd - call

==ḍāl - ڈ==

Ḍāl is pronounced like the English &quot;d&quot;.  It will be represented by &quot;ḍ&quot; in romanization.  

=====Initial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ڈیسک &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - ḍaisk - desk

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ڈالر &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - ḍālar - dollar

=====Medial=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; اکیڈمی &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - akaiḍamī - academy

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ریڈیٔو &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - rēḍīō - radio

=====Final=====


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; پونڈ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - paunḍ - pound

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; چیڈ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - chaiḍ - Chad (an African country)

==zāl - ذ==

Zāl is pronounced like the English &quot;z&quot;.  It will be represented by &quot;z&quot; in romanization.  

=====Initial/Medial/Final=====


By looking at dāl,  it shouldn't be difficult to determine zāl's forms.  Just add a dot on top of the letter.

==Summary==

You have now completed Lesson 2.  You have now learned jīm, chē, baṛī hē, xē, dāl, ḍāl, and zāl.  That's 7 letters, but only 2 positional methods.  

Thus far you have been taught the following:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ب پ ت ٹ ث &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ج چ ح خ د ڈ ذ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Remember these well, and feel free to go through Lesson 1 or 2 again if you feel you need to do so to help you remember the letters.  

When you are ready, proceed to Lesson 3.

There are two aspects to learning the Japanese characters. Recognising the shapes and learning to write them. These are further separated by the fact that the strokes that comprise a specific character have a certain order.

In addition to the base characters, there are special symbols to denote nuanced pronunciation, such as voiced and double consonants.

== Stroke order ==
{{Japanese kana navigation}}

In the pages linked to from the tables below, you will find stroke order diagrams for each of the hiragana and katakana characters. The voiced and plosive variants of the same row/group are listed on the same page.

* [[Japanese/Kana/Lessons/Katakana/Lesson 11|ヰヱ (ancient Katakana in disuse)]]

== Long vowels ==

A [[../Pronunciation#Long vowels|long vowel]] is written in hiragana with an extra &quot;あ&quot;, &quot;い&quot; or &quot;う&quot; depending on the vowel. In most cases あ follows あ; い follows い ''or'' え and う follows う ''or'' お.

There are rare exceptions where an え vowel is extended by adding え. Much less rare is an お vowel extended by お. Some examples of this include:
* &quot;おねえさん&quot;, &quot;おおい&quot;, and &quot;おおきい&quot;.

In katakana, it's written with a ''chōonpu'': &quot;ー&quot;.
* &quot;データ&quot; (''e.'' data) {{audio|Ja-deeta-data.ogg}}

== Voiced and plosive sounds ==
The turbid sound symbol, ''[[w:dakuten|dakuten]]'' ({{furi|濁点|だくてん}}) which looks like two slash marks from the left to right ( ゛) just at the top-right-hand corner of a character indicate that the preceding consonant is [[w:voiced | voiced]].  This symbol is also known as ''tenten'' {{furi|点々|てんてん}}, meaning &quot;two marks.&quot;

The half turbid sound symbol, ''[[w:handakuten|handakuten]]'' ({{furi|半濁点|はんだくてん}}) which looks like a circle ( ゜) located to the top-right-hand corner of a syllabary indicates the preceding consonant is [[w:plosive | plosive]].

== Double consonants ==

The [[../Pronunciation#Consonant doubling|double consonant]] is written by adding a small &quot;tsu&quot; (&quot;っ&quot; or &quot;ッ&quot;) in front of the doubled consonant syllable. This is called the [[w:sokuon |sokuon]] ({{furi|促音|そくおん}}).

The sokuon cannot be at the beginning of a word. In ''hiragana'', the sokuon can only appear before the &quot;か&quot;, &quot;さ&quot;, &quot;た&quot; and &quot;ば&quot; groups/rows.

Examples:
* &quot;どっち&quot; (''e.'' which) {{audio|Ja-docchi-which.ogg}}
* &quot;ポッキー&quot; (''e.'' [[w:Pocky|Pocky]] snacks) {{Audio|Pocky.ogg}}

== Yōon ==

In addition to those represented by the syllables in the kana, Japanese has sounds with a palatal or labio-velar semivowel between the consonant and the vowel. The sound is somewhat like that of the &quot;j&quot; between the &quot;f and the &quot;o&quot; in &quot;fjord&quot;. This is written by appending smaller versions of &quot;ya&quot;, &quot;yu&quot; and &quot;yo&quot; to the syllables from the &quot;i&quot; columns (&quot;ki&quot;, &quot;shi&quot;, &quot;chi&quot;, &quot;ni&quot;, &quot;hi&quot;, &quot;mi&quot;, &quot;ri&quot; and their variations). In this case, the two kana are not pronounced individually, but rather as one sound. These are called yōon ({{furi|拗音|ようおん}}).

:'''Note:''' The grayed compound characters are rarely used.

Compounds with &quot;yu&quot; and &quot;yo&quot; are often followed by an &quot;u&quot;, making it a long vowel.

=== Special yōon for transliteration ===
{{info|This section is for advanced learners.}}
There are certain kinds of special yōon which primarily represent pronunciations imported from foreign languages.  They commonly appear as parts of names of foreign people or foreign places.  Although they were originally considered to be unauthorized, they are nowadays widely accepted even by conservative media such as newspapers.  See the table below for commonly used ones among such compounds.

== Practice ==

Learning the kana takes some work and is best done by memorisation and drilling. Practice by writing up the table, speaking out the characters and drill yourself on the readings.

There are several online resources that can help you with these:
* [http://www.theiling.de/schrift/ Henrik Theiling's Script Teacher] — A site that drills on many different scripts, including hiragana and katakana.
* [http://www.languageguide.org/im/alpha/jp/hiragana_alpha_quiz.jsp Hiragana Quiz] at [http://www.languageguide.org/ languageguide.org] — A Kana Quiz that tests you with one small group of kana at a time.
* [http://www.msu.edu/~lakejess/kanjigame.html Kanji Game] — An online multiple choice kana and kanji game.
* [http://www.realkana.com Real Kana] — A highly customisable page which drills the user on kana readings.
* [http://brng.jp/50renshuu.pdf Kana Copybook (PDF)] — Memorize the Kana through handwriting.

GNU/Linux users may also download the [http://clayo.org/kanatest/ Kanatest] software, and [http://ichi2.net/anki/ Anki].

      <text xml:space="preserve">=The Network is the Message=
This is the title for the „Opening“ of the book „The Internet Galaxy“ by Manuel Castells in 2001.

It is a deliberate play on words: a pun. The first resolution is „The Medium is the Message“. This is the famous slogan of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan Marshall McLuhan].

Even the slogan is subject to ambiguity. An alternative reading is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Medium_is_the_Massage „The Medium is the Massage“].

The second linking from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet_Galaxy „The Internet Galaxy“] is to McLuhan's famous work [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Galaxy „The Gutenberg Galaxy“].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Eric Work graduated with his master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of California, Davis. He was a member of the VLSI Computing Laboratory (VCL) where he worked on mapping arbitrary connected task graphs onto parallel array architectures. The VCL group is focused on low-power DSP architectures and has fabricated two highly-parallel DSP chip multi-processors called the Asynchronous Array of Simple Processors (AsAP).  As an undergrad at the University of Washington, majoring in Electrical Engineering, Eric worked on global positioning techniques using WiFi hot spots.  He created a PocketPC application, called the UW Campus Navigator, with 4 other students from the University of Washington and 5 students from the Chinese University of Hong Kong as part of an international collaboration. He also created an educational suite for multimedia and networking, which was used to teach a class about multimedia in Seoul, South Korea lead by Professor Jenq-Neng Hwang.  Eric was Professor Hwang's teaching assistant for the multimedia class.

      <comment>/* Conversion to RDF */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Employee-Department case study used in the comparison of [[../XQuery from SQL/]] is used here to explore the XQuery/SPARQL pairing. 


== Conversion to RDF ==
Taking as the starting point the XML documents defining the three tables:
* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/emp.xml  Emp]
* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/dept.xml  Dept]
* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/empdept/salgrade.xml Salgrade]

These documents are[[../XML_to_RDF/ | converted to RDF]] using an XQuery script guided by a mapping file. The generated RDF is cached. and accessed by an XQuery script to de-reference the resource URIs. 


Individual resource URIs are re-written in Apache to calls on an XQuery script which retrieves the fragment of RDF from the cached file. Thus;
* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/empdept/emp/7369 an employee]
* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/empdept/dept/30 a department]
* [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/empdept/all/all The full RDF] (need to change the rewrite rule to fix this strange uri)

This should be replaced by a query on the SPARQL endpoint.

== RDF browsing ==

This RDF can be browsed with and RDF browser such as [http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/rdf_browser/ Disco ],  [http://demo.openlinksw.com/DAV/JS/rdfbrowser/index.html OpenLink RDF browser] [http://demo.openlinksw.com/rdfbrowser2/ OpenLink Data Explorer]  or Tabulator as an add-in to [http://widgets.opera.com/widget/5053/ Opera] or [http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2007/tab/  Firefox]

== Querying with SPARQL ==

The RDF can be queried with SPARQL. The same queries uses in the SQL /XQuery example are expressed in SPARQL in this [[../SPARQL_Tutorial/ | tutorial]]

This section covers advanced topics in phonetics (sounds) and phonology (systems of sounds).

== What's in this section? ==

The parts of this section are:
*'''Common sounds''':  Technical details that weren't covered in the Intermediate section, about sounds that ''were'' covered &amp;mdash; things like gemination, diphthongs, and suprasegmentals.
*'''Unusual sounds''':  Sounds that humans can produce, but that don't often occur in the world's languages, like clicks and pharyngeals.
*'''Non-human phonologies''':  What kinds of phonetics and phonology might apply to a language whose speakers aren't human.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I ended up messing up my settings making the program unusable. Uninstall and reinstall didn't fix it. I found if you install ( may not be necessary) and open documents and settings (in windows, your home folder may work under *nix) folder and delete the wings fold in your user name folder, you can get a clean install with default settings. Saving the content of that directory, is also give you a chance to recover from later configuration error and to get back to a previous one.

==Tables etc.==

Hello JeremyB.

Thanks for the fabulous job on the tables. Hopefully someone will create a script to automate them. Tables completely defeat me.

Don't worry about the math equations, I can fix those using MathType (it does all the scripting!!!). I just did a quick image upload load on them just so that I could move ahead a little faster. (Sorry).

All the best

Supermontage: Is an order display, quotation, and execution system. It allows for trading on Nasdaq Global Market, Nasdaq Capital market, and exchange listed securities and acts as the only system to access the quotes of Nasdaq market maker. 

•	Supermontage: displays 5 price levels for each security.
o	Including inside market and four best levels beneath 


Order-entry firm: is a firm that enters an order into SuperMontage. Orders can be for customers and broker-dealers thus they may be market makers or non-market makers

Supermontage: accepts= market orders, marketable limits order and limit orders. Order of up to 999,999 

Will accept short sales but will only execute if they comply w/ NASD short sale rules


NASDAQ market velocity- measures order activity within NASDAQ.  Including quotes, orders, updates and cancellations.

Quote types:
1.	Market participant Entered- The market participant maintains its quote
2.	Summary quote- allows several quotes at different price levels.
3.	System Generated- When market participant quote is exhausted, Supermontage will generate a quote based on the market price

Automatic Quote Refresh (AQR) – Refreshes quotes when previous quote size falls below one round lot. With price and size preselected by market participant. If participant has multiple quotes that might be better priced than the quote that would not be created by the AQR, then better-priced quote will be displayed 

EX. MM#1 has 2 quotes 15.40 and 15.45 and AQR is set at $.1 and MM1# best offer is (15.40) but is decremented down to zero. Then MM1# quote will increase to 15.45 not 15.50 because it is better-priced quote.



If there are no other participants quoting in the stock, the price will be refreshed by no lower than one tick inferior from the last valid inside market or no lower than one tick inferior from the market participant’s last displayed quote before the 30 seconds expired, which is less. 

Reserve- Allows firms to maintain an additional amount of securities to trade unknown to market participants. In order to maintain must have at least 100 share (one round lot)

Once a Market Maker displayed and reserve size is exhausted then the market maker:
•	Manually enter new quote
•	Use automatic quote refresh 

If a quote is not entered or automatic quote refresh is not used them Nasdaq will enter a quote on its behalf

New types of orders: 

Non-Directed Orders- Liability orders are orders that create an obligation to buy or sell a security. They are delivered to or executed against a market maker’s display, or reserve size or delivered to ECN. If orders are not sent non-directed  may either be market orders or marketable limit order.

Preferenced order: are orders that are sent to a specific market participant that is at the inside market. Perferenced orders are entered into the non-directed order process previously described and considered liability orders. If the market participant who receives the order is not at the inside market, the order will be rejected. IF partial fill then unexecuted portion will be returned to the sending firm


Trades on Supermontage- occur automatically(locked-in), except with manual executions.  Nasdaq market makers and UTP exchanges must accept automatic executions. Upon trade both parties are notified of the transaction and report is sent to NASDAQ and Clearing agency.

Nasd operates: SuperMontage, CQS and the OTC Bulletin Board

ECN (not NASD operated)- an electronic system that widely disseminates to third parties orders entered by market makers and permits such orders to be executed against in whole or in part. (doesn’t include- Crossing systems: such as ITG/Posit or internal broker-dealer order routing system 

	Can include institutional investors as well as broker-dealers
	ECNS are either operated by a broker-dealer, are registered as broker-dealer themselves or are registered with SEC
	Orders from ECN’s are included in NASDAQ quote montage. 

ECN Interaction w/ SuperMontage
	ECN are not required to maintain two sided quote and act only in an agency capacity to execute order. Since ECN quotes can access internally by subscribers to the system. Plus they would be able to execute on SuperMontage creating double jeopardy making them take a principal position or (proprietary positions)

2 types of participation in Supermontage as Order Delivery ECN or Full Participation ECN.

Order Delivery ECN:  has the ability to post aggregate subscribers order and enter non-directed orders into SuperMontage to access other market participant quotes. 
	
	Market participates can interact with order delivery ECN’s by sending non-directed SuperMontage orders to them. Supermontage will decrement the ECN’s displayed size by the amount for which the order is sent. 

	An order delivery ECN can accept, decline, partially fill, price improve, or allow an order to time-out. If an order times-out after being sent to an ECN, it is canceled by SuperMontage and sent to the next market participant at the inside market. 

	If the ECN’s displayed quote is partially decremented, the remaining interest will be canceled or set to the next price provided to SuperMontage by the ECN. If  no price level is set by the ECN, SuperMontage will be set to zero 


Full Participation ECNs:  an ECN that has agreed to accept automatic executions by SuperMontage participants. The can also send order to other market participant for execution. Full participation ECNs have 5 character identifier ex  ECNA+

UTP Exchanges:
•	Can participate in SuperMontage
•	Must accept automatic executions
•	Can enter directed and non-directed order
•	National securities exchanges that trade unlisted securities only enter multiple quotes if they are agency orders, designated as non-attributable orders

OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB) 7:30 am-6:30pm- is an electronic quotation service for OTC equity securities. Displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices and volume information.

•	OTC Equity security- is generally any equity that is not listed or traded on Nasdaq or a national securities exchange. Including Domestic and foreign equity issues, warrants, units, ADRS and direct participation programs. 
•	Does not have listing requirements 
•	But must file periodic financial information with the SEC or other regulators and must remain current. If not filed with in the 30-60 days grace period will be delinquent

Quotes included in OTCBB
•	2-sided quote (bid and off)
•	Bid only
•	Offer price only

•	Bids or offers accompanied by a modifier reflecting unsolicited customer interest 

During normal business hours quotes must be firm except for (DPPS) direct participation programs securities

Minimum quote size:  5,000 shares @ prices up to $.5
		    To   50 shares @ process above $200 

OTCBB is a real time system- quotes may be updated by market makers at anytime. DPPs are updated twice a day between 8:30-9:30 and 12-12:30

When referring to OTCBB Securities.
Reps must be careful because OTCBB securities should not be mislead to allow investors to believe that it is the NASDAQ market. Since bulletin board stocks do not meet listing standards. For instance the NASD is concerned that because the equity has a ticker symbol then it will be seen as a NASDAQ equity. 

Initiation of Quotes for Non-NASDQ OTC securities 

	Rules 15c2-11- requires that broker –dealers who wish to publish quotes for a non-Nasdaq OTC equity security must collect and review certain information about the issuer. Meaning to initiate or resume quotes in an inter-dealer quote medium.

Third-Market Trading

OTC transactions in listed securities (Nasdaq Intermarket transaction)

Market-Maker Obligation Regarding Quotes:

Firm quote rule-The member is obligated to execute an order presented to it at a price at least as favorable as its published quote. 

The obligation to fill the order begins when the order is presented regardless of how it was transmitted

Except:
•	The market maker communicated to NASDAQ a revised price or size prior to the presentation of the order.
•	The market maker just effected or is in the process of effecting a transaction at the time the order is presented and immediately upon completion of the transaction, communicates a revised quote to NASDAQ (Trading Ahead exception)

Backing away- failing to buy or sell a normal unit of trading


NASD Rules on Quotations:

	If one member firm disseminates a quote on behalf of another firm, it must have reason to believe the quote was bona fide. Quotes include indications such as Bid wanted or offer wanted not just priced quotes

	If a member give a priced bid or offer the member must be prepared to honor it at the price and under the conditions stated. (NASD version of the Firm quote rule)

	If a member published a subject quote but will not update firm quote it is considered backing away

Nasdaq Quote rules: Must be two sided and firm. (Except when the market maker is publishing a stabilizing bid.)

If a market maker updates its quote, but does not specify a size for the update, a new quote will assume the previous quote size


Trade- or Fade:

If a market maker is required to honor its quoted size, failure to honor a larger size order would force the market maker to change its quote. The rule requires that NASDAQ market makers to publish an inferior quote anytime they fail to execute the full size of an incoming order that is at least one normal unit of trading greater than the market maker’s published quotation size. 


Anticompetitive activities regarding quotations: 
•	A market maker moves an offer down at the request of another market maker
•	A market maker provided information to another member firm’s trader regarding an institutional customer strategies
•	A market maker reveals to another member firms trader a larger net long or short position

Locked or Crossed Markets:

Crossed- occurs when a market maker enters a bid quote that is higher than the ask quote of another market maker or the ask quote is lower than the bid quote of another market maker.

A situation arising when the bid price of a security exceeds the ask price.

Contrary to normal markets where the bid-ask spread is positive; in a cross-market the spread is negative. This scenario occurs mainly in volatile and high volume

Locked- occurs when the highest bid and lowest offer are equal

 A short-term situation occurring within a market where both the bid and ask are identical, resulting in no bid-ask spread.

Locked markets are typically corrected immediately through subsequent trades. This abnormal market condition occurs mainly on the Nasdaq exchange for orders entered before the opening bell.

Opening Quotes:

Opening Nasdaq- 9:25 am EST. At this point quoting is firm and becomes auto-executable. 

Any quotes that order or carry a price that would lock the market are placed in Queue.

Queue- is a holding state in which the order are placed until they can be executed

The quotes and orders are executed in time priority against the best bid (for sell orders) and best ask (for buy orders). If a quote or order is reached for execution, but is not executable at the time is added to the book  

Inside Market:  Bid 19.95  ask 15.97

Would lock or cross the book:
	MM1 Bid for 100 shares 16.25
	LLCL bid 500 shares 16.00
	MM2 ask 100 shares 15.44
	MM1 ask for 200 shares at 15.40

Anti-internalization qualifier will prevent the automated system from executing a market participant’s order with its own quote and will send the order to the next market participant.

When an order is entered after 9:25 am it is added to the In Queue Based quotes and orders in time priority. 

If a Nasdaq market maker enters a quote after 9:25 that would lock or cross the market, an execution occurs at the inside market


Opening Cross:

Begins 9:28 am orders in the NASDAQ market center are automatically executed. 
At this time orders cannot be canceled but can be changed to be more aggressive (order that is better in price or size)

All ordered executed in the Opening Cross are automatically reported in to ACT with a .T modifier 

Order imbalance indicator: is an electronic messaging that provides information about orders involved in the opening process. Messages are sent out every 15 seconds until 9:28:20 am and then increases to every 5 seconds until the market opens.

Info provided on the Order Imbalance Indicator
•	The inside match price
•	The number of shares represented by each order type paired at the inside match price
•	The size of an imbalance
•	The buy or sell direction of any imbalance
•	The indicative prices at which the opening cross would take place if executed at the time of the dissemination and the percent outside the current inside market on the Nasdaq Market center

Often indicative prices are termed Near Clearing Price and Far Clearing Price

Near Clearing price is the price at which all quotes and orders during the opening cross would execute

Far Clearing price- is the price at which MOO,LOO,IO and early regular hours orders only would execute 
	

How is the official Opening price determined ? (one of the 3)
1.	A price that maximizes the volume of MOO,LOO,IO and early regular hours orders and executable quotes executed- if more than one price exists, the system would check for the next price
2.	A price that minimizes imbalances –if more than one price exists, the system would check for the next price
3.	A price that minimizes the distance from the bid-ask midpoint of the inside quote


The Nasdaq Official Opening price- is based on the orders that are in queue what NASDAQ opens for trading at 9:30 am.  It is the price of the first trade executed and reported within Nasdaq market center, if at 9:30:15am there is no opening match then the NOOP is based on the last eligible sale reported in the Market Center.

NASDAQ Closing Cross-the process begins at 3:50 pm

This is when an order imbalance indicator begins dissemination. The indicators provides info on Market-on close(MOC), Limit- On-close (LOC) and imbalance only orders (IOO)

Imbalance indicator is sent at the following times

3:50- 3:55- every 30 seconds
3:55-3:59- 15s
3:59-3:59:59-5s

at 4:00pm est SuperMontage executes the max number of shares at a single price, this represents the NASDAQ official closing price .

Voluntary and Excused Withdrawals

Nasdaq market maker may terminate its registration in a security by withdrawing its quotes on a voluntary (unexcused) basis. May not register as a market maker in the security for 20 business days.

Excused circumstances
1.	An excused withdrawal for up to 5 business days may be granted for circumstance beyond the market maker control

Excused withdrawals because of vacations may be granted if the application is made one business day in advance and included a list of securities for which withdrawal is requested 
5.	Market makers that are participants in a securities distribution are covered by special rules. (Passive Market Making)
6.	If a firm fails to maintain a clearing relationship with a registered clearing agency or a member of a clearing agency. It may reenter quotes after reestablishing a clearing relationship. If a market makers’ failure to maintain a clearing relationship is voluntary, its withdrawal is considered voluntary, not excused 
7.	If a firm has a fail to deliver in a threshold security at its clearing firm for a period of 13 continuous settlement days and the security cannot be borrowed in order to effect a short sale transaction as part of a bona-fide market making, the firm qualifies for an excused withdrawal 

Passive Market Making: 

•	Market makers involved in distribution may not enter a bid or effect a purchase at a price that exceeds the highest independent bid on NASDAQ
•	In a falling market, when the last independent bid drops below the passive market maker, the passive maker can maintain its bid until 
§	Its purchases have reached or exceeded the lesser of 2 time the minimum quotation size for the security or the maker remaining daily limit.
•	At that point ,the passive market maker must drop its bid to below the independent bid. 
•	In a rising market the passive makers do not have to raise the bid when the independent bid rises.
•	If there is no independent market maker then passive market making is not allowed

Daily Purchase Limit: a passive market makers limit is the greater of 30% of its ADTV in the stock or 200 shares. Once a passive maker’s net purchases for the day are more than its purchase limit ,it must then withdrawal from the market for the rest of the day. If close to the limit can execute one more trade that would put them over the limit. 

If execution of a buy and sell order are within 30seconds then the order will only count as a net purchase

Margin Accounts- Transactions in a Margin account require some type of deposited by a customer

2 choices: Long positions and Short positions (while both would be executed in one margin account)

When purchasing stock in a long margin account, a customer will pay part of a the purchase price by the settlement date (generally 50%) and the broker dealer will finance the balance of the purchase.

Internal account number is very important, since it is the agent’s mean of identifying the customer

Day-Trading: (Special requirements apply to account opening procedures for broker-dealers who promote the use of day-trading strategy 

Day-trading strategy: an overall trading strategy characterized by the regular transmission by customer of intra-day orders to effect both purchase and sale transactions in the same security or securities. Transmitting one or more ‘round trip’ transactions in a single day

The NASD’s day trading rules apply if a broker-dealer affirmatively promotes day-trading activities or strategies through advertising, training seminars, or direct outreach programs.

A broker dealer is also considered to promote day trading if it uses a third party to advertise.


A firm will not be considered to be promoting day trading solely by:

•	Promoting efficient execution services or lower execution costs based on multiple trades
•	Providing general investment research or advertising the high quality or prompt availability of its general research
•	Having a Web site that provide general financial information or new or that allows the multiple entry of intra-day purchase and sales of the same security 

If a Broker-dealer does not itself advertise day-trading strategies, it will be considered to be promoting day trading if one of its principals or officials is aware that any of the firm’s individual registered rep is promoting the practice. 

Consequences of Promoting day trading: if a firm is considered to be promoting day trading
o	Provide a risk disclosure statement on day trading prior to opening an account for a non-institutional customer
o	Either (A) approve the customer’s account for a day-trading strategy; (B) obtain from a customer a written agreement that the customer does not intend to use the account for day-trading purposes

A firm may not rely on the written statement from the customer if it know the customer intends to day trade the account. IF a firm later discovers a customer is using an account for day trading the firm must approve the account for day trading as soon as practicable , but no than 10 days after discovery


SEC Regulation SP

	Privacy of Consumer Financial Information

REG SP is the SEC response to the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999. 

States: all broker-dealers, investment companies, and investment advisers registered with the SEC to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to protect the privacy of the confidential information

The Timing of the notice depends on the client’s relationship with the firm. REG SP divides clients into
		Customers- someone who has an ongoing relationship with the firm
		Consumers- someone who provides information to the firm in connection with a potential transaction 

	Firms must provide notice when the relationship is initiated and annually 

If a firm must give every consumer a privacy notice before it discloses any nonpublic information to any nonaffiliated third party.
	Must state:
		Type of personal info the firm collects
		Categories of third parties to whom info is disclosed
		Give client a way to opt out of the disclosing. Must be reasonable (writing a letter to indicate this desire is not reasonable)

Updating Account Information

It is important  because if a client’s situation has changed, transactions might be executed that are inappropriate. 
	Several items are more important

•	Address Changes: If client address change, it is important to note whether they now live in a different state. Because both the rep and firm must be registered in that state 
•	Financial Background: It is important to verify that the information on file is accurate. Changes in patterns of purchases and sales might indicate a different financial situation. 
•	Objectives: in the long run all clients will change or modify their investment objectives.  This is especially true as client’s age. 

Death of the Account owner:

If an individual account owner dies, any open orders for the account should be canceled and no other activity should take place until legal authority has been proven. 

The new account is usually set up  “ The Estate of (deceased’s name)”

Then the account is transferred by the executor or administrator of the estate to the name of the estate
	The documents required for this are:
		Death certificate
		Copy of the will or court appointment (letter testamentary)
		Affidavit of domicile
		State inheritance tax waiver

If a person who has granted power of attorney dies, the power is automatically terminated

Securities are generally valued for these purposes as of the date of death or an alternative date six months after the date of death. Approximately 2/3 of the states have adopted the Uniform Transfer on Death Registration Act- allowed account owners to designate beneficiaries, helps avoid probate but not estate taxes

Transferring Accounts

If a customer wants to transfer an account from one member firm to another member fir , the customer must give written instructions to the receiving firm. Both member firms are required to coordinate their activities in order to expedite the transfer.

Each firm must also debit/credit the related money account

If both firms have ACATS (automated customer account transfer service) they must use such a system 

Order Tickets:

•	The customer Limit Order Protection Rule applies only during the hours Nasdaq is open, normally 9:30 am to 6:30 pm
•	If a customer gives a broker-dealer a not-held or working order, the rule does not apply, since the firm is being given the authority to exercise its brokerage judgment. However the firm should clearly document that is has received such authority for the customer.
•	The interpretation does not apply to odd-lot orders
•	If the market-marking desk of a firm is holding a customer limit order, no other trading desk in that firm (such as risk-arbitrage desk) may knowing trade ahead of the customer’s order
•	If another desk executes an order for the firm’s account that would have filled the customer order, the market maker may owe the customer an immediate execution.
•	As long as information barriers are present it prevents the nonmarket-making desk from obtaining knowledge of customer limit orders
•	Executions through SuperMontage can trigger a manning obligation

Partial Executions- If a firm triggers a Manning obligation, it is required to fill only as much of the customer orders as it has executed for its own account

Price Improvement: If a market maker holds an undisplayed limit order priced better than its quote and subsequently receives a market order on the opposite side of the market, it is not appropriate for the firm to execute the market order at its published quote and the limit order at its limit price.  The broker must price-improve the market order to the limit order price  

A market maker has the option of pricing-improving the market order in such a way that its Manning Obligation is not triggers. This could be done by executing the market order at a minimum increment above the order price. 

The Min price improvement required is $.01, the Min quote increment

Market Order Protection- NASD RULE 2111 protects market orders received by a member firms. A member is prohibited from trading ahead of a customer market order in its won account without, immediately thereafter, executing the market order at the same price or better.

Conformations and other Disclosures

SEC rule 10b-10: requires that broker-dealer provide customers with a detailed confirmation of any purchase or sale. A broker-dealer must give or send a confirmation to the customer at or before the completion of the transaction.

The following info is usually included
•	The identity, CUSIP, and price of the security bought or sold, along with the number of shares, units, or principal amount
•	The date of the transaction, as well as the time of execution or a statement that the time will be furnished upon written requests.

Commission/ Markups:  

	Commission- is the charge that a broker-dealer assesses for executing an agency trade for the customer. 

	Markup- is the difference, in a principal transaction, between the price charged to the customer and the prevailing inter-dealer price. 


All Remuneration (commissions) must be disclosed on the confirmation and must be disclosed on the confirmations. 

Principal transactions- report only the net price (including the markup)

Currently 2 situations were markups are disclosed:
•	Riskless principal transitions, in which the broker-dealer purchase the security for the resale to the customer only when the customer’s order is already in hand
•	Principal transactions in Nasdaq stock or in list stocks traded OTC. Markups on listed stocks and Nasdaq Global Market securities are required to be disclosed by Rule 10-10 because they are “Reported Securities’ under Sec rules. NASDAQ mark ups must be disclosed on confirmations 

A broker-dealer must disclose the amount of commission it charged on a transaction if it acted in an agency capacity. 

If a broker-dealer acted as both buy and seller in a single transaction, it must disclose this fact to both the buyer and seller.  (Must also offer to disclose the time when transaction occurred and name of the other party to the transaction.)

A broker-dealer CAN NOT act as a broker (agent) and dealer (principal) on the same transaction 

Payment for Order Flow:  Many firms automatically route certain types of small retail customer trades to a specific broker-dealer for execution. Executing broker will pay a per-share fee to the originating broker for this arrangement

Confirms under this must disclose this practice and offer to provide additional info on request.

A broker-dealer must provide written info about its payment-for-order-flow practices when opening a new account and annually thereafter.

Requests for Further Information

A firm has 5 business days after the request to provide the additional data , unless the transaction occurred more than 30 days prior to the request, the firm may take 15 business days to supply the info

Errors: should be brought to the attention of a supervisor

Additional disclosure: The broker-dealer may have to make other disclosures to the customer on certain trades.

Control Relationships- additional disclosure is needed for a customer, which the firm is “controlled by, controlling, or under common control with the issuer”  Ex broker is owned by a publicly traded company

This must be done prior to the trade for the customer

Disclosure of interest in Distribution- A firm is obligated to disclose, in writing, its interest in the distribution at or before the completion of the transaction.  Ex (a dealer participates in a distribution of securities and receives an investment advisory fee, this created conflict of interest) 

Completion of a Transaction- Sec rules say something needs to be done “at or before the completion of the transactions.”
•	In a purchase by a customer, completion normally occurs when the customer makes payment of any part of the purchase price to the broker-dealer, If the payment is made by a bookkeeping entry, completion occurs when the broker-dealer makes a bookkeeping entry for any part of the purchase price
•	However, in a purchase, if the customer pays prior to the time the payment is due, competition occurs when the security is transferred out of the customer’s account 
•	However in a sale if the customer delivers the security prior to the time of delivery is due the completing occurs when the broker-dealer makes payment into the account of the customer  

Account Statement-  should be sent at least quarterly, but usually its monthly

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 grants the power to regulate credit purchases of securities to the Federal Reserve Board (FED). 

Regulation T, governs the extension of credit by broker-dealer
Regulation U, govern extension of credit by lenders other than broker-dealers
Regulation X , governs those who borrow to buy securities

Regulation U pertains to lender making loans to investors who use securities as collateral for the loan and would apply to partners of member firms who are buying for their own account as well as customers. 

	Limits that apply under U are not applicable if the transactions are by a market maker or underwriter.
	The ability of these dealers to use credit is only limited by the lender’s credit standards

REG X: pertains to borrowers within or outside the United States who intend to purchase or transfer U.S. securities that are regulated under the Boards T and U. Borrowers who are subject to REG X must ensure the source is legitimate


A borrow is subject to REG X IF
•	Is with the U.S. and causes credit to be granted unlawfully without adhering to REG T or U. 
•	Is considered a U.S. person who is outside the U.S. and acquires credit or purchase or transfer U.S. Securities
•	Or a non-U.S. person who is directed by or acting on behalf of a U.S. person


Regulation T: determines which securities may be purchased on credit (margin) through a broker-dealer, when payment must be made and the amount of credit that may be extended.

Marginable Securities- include
•	Exchange Listed Securities
•	Nasdaq Securities

Not Marginable- Stocks on OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB) or in pink sheets

Investment Company Securities- 

Open-end investment company securities, (mutual funds) and UIT (unit investment trust) are Marginable securities under REG T and may be used as collateral in margin account.

SEA act of 1934 prevents the extension of credit on a new issue by a participant in distribution for 30 days. 

Thus a dealer cannot extend credit on initial purchases but once held for 30 days it can be used as collateral for a loan in a margin account a the dealer

Payment Deadlines- Reg T requires payment for purchases in cash and margin accounts be made promptly. In cash account its 100% but in margin it is a lower %. 

	If the payment is not received within 2 business days following settlement date (REG T payment date) broker-dealer is required to sell out of the securities, unless valid extension reason. 

	Liquidation in both cash and margin accounts occur the day after the REG T payment date or the third business day following settlement.

If an account is liquidated the account is on freeze for 90 days. Thus the customer must pay in advance for all purchases. 

After 90 days the customers credit is reestablished and can be extended normal credit terms

Freeriding- customer makes a purchase and then meets the payment through liquidation. Meaning customer could not purchase a stock and then sell the same stock in order to pay the purchase price.

For trading purposes: customers own the security as of the trade date. They may sell the securities at any time after the trade has been executed. Whether or not it has been paid for yet. 

If a customer sells the securities prior to settlement date but does not withdraw the proceeds and pays the original purchase by the Reg T payment date there is no REG T violation and member account is not put on freeze. 

Free-riding applies if the customer sells the security and does not pay for the purchase by the payment date. 

Broker-dealers are not required to collect funds by the REG T payment date if the amount is less than $1000

Extensions- In exceptional circumstances, a member firm may apply to the NASD or exchange for an extension  of time for the payment amount due. For example if there was a delay in the mail. The extension is granted by the NASD or exchange and must apply  for the REG T deadline.

COD Transactions- Normal payment period does not apply. In a COD account, where securities are delivered to the customer’s custodian bank and a paid upon delivery, the broker has 35 calendar days in which to deliver and receive payment. If the unable to deliver in 35 must apply to NASD for an extension

Opening  a Margin Account- 
	Margin department keeps records of all customer accounts and insures that payment is made in accordance with Reg T requirements 

	When a new margin account is opened for a customer, the member firm must send the customer a statement of the amount of interest they will be charged and the method by which interest will be computed.

A broker-dealer that extends credit to a customer must disclose:
	Condition under which interest charges will be imposed
	Percentage interest charge
	Method of computing interest
	Method of deterring the debit balance on which interest will be charged

Written statement must be sent to all customers to whom credit is extended at least quarterly. Customer must sign a margin agreement 

Hypothecation 
	Practices prohibited:
§	Commingling of securities for the account of a customer with those of another customer without obtaining the written consent of each customer
§	Commingling the securities of a customer with those of any person who is not a customer of the broker-dealer ,including securities owned by broker-dealer
§	Hypothecating customer securities for a sum that exceeds the total indebtedness of all customers 

With permission, broker-dealer are to use their customer’s securities as collateral for bank loans under a process can Rehypohecation.  The dealer must obtain the consent of each customer in order to rehypothecate the stock of the customer at a bank in a single loan account.

Amount that may be rehypothecated:  The customer protection rule, permits broker-dealers to use stock with a value of 140% of the customers debit balance as collateral for a bank loan. They may borrow only the amount that it lent the customer, but may collateralize the borrowing with stock valued at 140% of the debit balance 

Check book example!

Stock loans- in order for broker-dealers to loan a customers stock to another dealer it  may do so only if a consent agreement is signed. 

•	Loan consent agreement is an optional provision

•	Borrower has the right to recall borrowed stock at any time  

•	Lender of the stock retains all rights except the right to vote


CH 10
7-11

Initial Margin

Reg T established the min amount of margin a customer must deposit when establishing a position. 

Initial margin is the % of the purchase price, including commission that the customer must deposit with the broker-dealer. 

	The balance of the total purchase price is called the Loan Value: is the amount that the broker-dealer may finance. It is the complement of margin requirements 

EX. Margin requirement is 70% thus loan value is 30%

Since 1974 initial margin requirements is set at 50%. 

Meeting a Call: Once the initial margin is deposited, Reg T does not  require additional money if the price of stock declines

NASD will require the deposit of additional margin (a maintenance margin call) if the account equity declines beyond certain levels 

A customer may deposit stock that is fully paid and borrow against the stock. But it must be a Marginable stock

Excess Equity and SMA

Excess equity- refers to equity in a margin account that is greater than REG T multiplied by the market value 

EX.    MV $12,000   Debt balance - $5,000  thus Equity is $7,000

Reg T Req  on $12,000 of stock is $6,000 (50% of $12,000).  

Thus $7,000 Equity - $6,000 (Reg T) thus there is $1,000 of excess equity


SMA- Special Memorandum Account.- the amount of cash that may be withdrawn from a margin account. 

Excess equity is created by the appreciation of securities, cash dividends, the sale of securities, and voluntary deposits of cash or fully paid, Marginable securities by the account holder. When excess equity is created a SMA notation is created showing how much can be borrowed 

Usually closing prices of preceding day are used to indicate equity and SMA

SMA increases with an increase in equity yet SMA does not decrease when excess equity declines.

Restricted account: if the debt balance of an account is greater than the loan value the account is restricted. How ever additional purchases can be made as long as the customer  deposits the amount required by REG T

If an account is restricted, but it has SMA balance then as long as the min maintenance requirement is not violated. Since Reg T is an initial requirement, additional cash is not required to eliminate restriction. 
 
 

Sale in a Restricted Account: A customer who sells stock in restricted account may withdraw 50% of the amount sold. The balance of the amount sold  must be maintained in the account as per the retention requirement. If 100% of amount sold is left in the account then that will be applied toward the debt balance


Buying power: If a customer has SMA in a Margin Account it may be withdrawn as a loan or used to purchase additional securities on margin.  Buying power is the ability to buy securities on credit and only applicable in margin accounts. 

LMV               -DR                        =   EQ
 $30,000          $10,000                  = $20,000      SMA= 5000

Buying power thus is  5000/.5 = $10,000

Minimum Maintenance Requirement

NASD  requires that customer maintain a certain minimum equity in margin accounts after the initial requirements are met. 
	
Margin call or maintenance call- is when equity drops below the min equity, the member firm must call for additional margin

Minimum Maintenance requirement for a long account is 25%    Thus equity must be at least 25% of the CMV.   

LMV       - DR              = EQ
$25,000   -$10,000      =  $15,000

LMV  *   Min Equity 
$25,000      .25     =   $6,250   (well under the  $15,000 equity in the account)

To determine the point at which the market value would have to decline before a long account is at the 25% minimum equity level, multiple the debit balance by 4/3


In-house maintenance margin requirement:  a broker-dealer may have an in-house maintenance margin requirements that are greater than regulatory requirement, These requirement may be increased at any time without advanced notice. A broker –dealer is required to provide 30-days advance written notice of changes to be made to the terms and conditions under which credit charges will be made, excluding changes required by law
 
Guarantees: The account of a customer may be guaranteed by another customer. This means that if a customer’s account balance is undermargined, the equity if anther account may be used as collateral 


Minimum Initial Equity Requirement

There is a minimum dollar requirement on a purchase in a margin account. The minimum initial margin deposit must be $2,00 unless the amount of the purchase is less than $2,000, which calls for the customer to deposit the full purchase price. 

Once the initial equity requirement has been met, no maintenance call is required if the dollar amount of equity subsequently drops below $2,000.
 
 
CH 10
14-15

Short Accounts:

	A  short sale is a transaction completed by the delivery of stock the customer does not own. In order to effect delivery ,the broker-dealer handling the account will borrow stock. 

	
Credit Balance (CR)- The customer’s account will be credited with the sale proceeds plus the cash margin deposited required. 


(SMV) short market value - is what the customer owes the broker at the current market value


CR- SMV = EQ (equity)

Short sale initial deposit is 50% margin. The broker will borrow the stock and the customer,  who must eventually replace the stock borrowed, owes the broker the value of the stock. 

Minimum Maintenance Requirement: usually it is around 30% of the market value. 

Ex. Short sell $25,000 the MMR would be $7,500

To determine how high the market value can go before a maintenance call multiple Credit Balance by 10/13 (.769)

$2.50 per share or 100% of current market value, which ever is great if the short stock is less than $5.00 per share
$5.00 per share or 30% of the current market value, whichever is greater, if the short stock is valued at $5.00 per share or above

Day Trading Margin:
	
Special rules apply to accounts of pattern day traders. A pattern day trader is any customer who day trades 4 or more times in 5 business day period. 

If a customer meets the definition of a pattern day trader, but the # of day trades is 6% or less of total trades for the five-business day period, the customer will not be considered a pattern day trader

Day trading: the purchasing and selling or selling and purchasing of the same security on the same day in a margin account.

Except- 
a long position held overnight and sold the next prior to any new purchase of the same security. 
A short position held overnight and purchased the next day prior to and new sale of the same security


If the broker-deal has a reasonable basis that the customer opening an account or resuming day trading will engage in a pattern of day trading, the firm can impose special day trading margin requirements   

Minimum Equity requirement:  Pattern day traders have a minimum equity requirement of $25,000 rather than the normal minimum requirement of $2,000. This must be deposited in the account before any day-trading can begin


Margin Calls- Day trading buying power is limited to 4X the traders maintenance margin excess, determined at the close of the pervious day. 
	
	If a day-trader exceeds buying power then must make a margin  call within 5 business days.

During restricted times: the  buying power is only 2x the traders maintenance margin 

	If the margin call is not met in 5 days, trading is restricted for 90 days or until call is met

Funds deposited to meet min equity requirement or  day-trading margin call must remain on deposit in the account for at least 2 business days  

Cross-Guarantees Prohibited: Pattern day trading are not permitted to meet day-trading margin requirements through the use of cross-guarantees. Each- day trading account much meet the requirements independently, based only on the resources in the account. This prohibits cross-guarantees not only between accounts of different customers, it also prohibits cross-guarantess between different account of the same customer

Trade Reporting 

ACT:

NASD Rules require the reporting of most over-the-counter- equity transactions. Usually are covered through Nasdaq’s Automated Confirmation Transaction service (ACT)

ACT’s: the system facilitates the reporting and clearing of Nasdaq and OTC transactions by allowing the order-entry and market-making firm to enter price trades. This info is used to report, match and clear transactions.

	ACTS is NOT an order-execution system ,trades entered have been executed in another system

Market-Maker Obligations
	Report trades in Nasdaq National Market securities, Nasdaq Small Cap securities, CQS issues, OTC equity securities, Nasdaq-listed convertible bonds within 90 seconds (during normal hours), enter trade details for all clearable and internalized transactions using the Nasdaq workstation 2
	Correct, decline, or cancel trades, when necessary 
	
Order-Entry Firm Obligations: Act rules require  that order-entry side must do one of the following:
•	Enter a version of the trade within 20 mins of execution using the OE function on Nasdaq 2
•	Accept the market-maker trade entry on ACT trade scan within 20 mins of executions 
•	Decline an incorrect market-maker trade entry on ACT Trade Scan or cancel the trade entry

Once a trade has been matched, either because the order-entry side accepted the trade on ACT. ACT matches the trade details entered by the market-maker and order-entry sides, the transaction is considered locked-in for clearing purpose.

ACT Trade Scan:
ACT Trade Scan can be used by both market-makers and order-entry firms

•	View trades entered into the system
•	Accept, decline, or cancel open trades (market makers can correct trades)
•	Break a matched or accepted trade (both sides must agree)
•	Change an entry from principal (P) to agent (A) or Riskless principal (R) or from A to P or R 

Reporting Transactions in Nasdaq Securities:
•	Nasdaq National Market securities and Nasdaq Small Cap securities are virtually the same. Except that NNM securities are reported because of SEC rules where as SmallCap are reported to the NASD

Normal Trading Hours:  (9:30 –4 eastern)

	Transactions in Nasdaq securities must be reported to ACT within 90 second of execution
If the ACT is not available, trade must reported by phone to the Market Operations Department. 
	Trades not reported within 90 seconds must be reported ASAP and will carry the ‘.SLD’ along with time of transaction  

Transactions Outside of Normal Market Hours

•	12am- 8am : trades are reported through ACT on trade date between 8:00am and 9:30am. Should be identified “.T” and accompanied by execution

•	8am-9:30 am: Trades are reported to ACT within 90 seconds of execution . If not in 90 seconds then should be “.T”

•	9:30-4: Normal requirements    Transactions in Nasdaq securities must be reported to ACT within 90 second of execution. Trades not reported within 90 seconds must be reported ASAP and will carry the ‘.SLD’ along with time of transaction  

•	4-6:30 pm : Trades are reported through ACT within 90 seconds of execution. Identifier “.T”

•	6:30 pm to Midnight: Trades are to be reported through ACT on the next business day (T+1) between 8am –6:30 . Trades should be designated as  “as/of” trades and the time of execution should be reported.  

Form T: Transactions were not reported to ACT according to the preceding rules must be reported to the Market Regulation Department weekly on form T. Should be used as a back up only if Trade data cannot be entered electronically.  Excessive or unjustified use of this reporting procedure could lead to disciplinary action

Who Reports: To avoid double counting,  the transaction is reported by only one side of the trade
•	In a transaction between 2 registered market makers, only the seller reports
•	In a transaction between a market maker and a member firm who is not a market maker reports
•	In a transaction between 2 members, neither of whom are market makers, only the seller reports
•	In a transaction between a member firm and a customer, only the member firm reports.

Riskless Principal Transactions- is defined as a trade in which a member firm 
•	After having received an order to buy
•	After having received an order to sell a security, sells the security at the same price, as principal, in order to satisfy the order to sell 

This definition applies to firms that make a market in the security involved as well as non-market makers.

When determining whether two trades are done at the same price, commission, markups, and markdowns are excluded

EX: MM1 has customer order to sell 1000 shares of  xyz. MM1 sells xyz 1000 shares to MM2 as principal @21
       MM1 then fills customer order as principal 20.80 net (.20 mark down). Since the price of both trades is 21 when the markdown is excluded, this is considered a Riskless principal transaction.

As the seller MM1 has the reporting obligation. 
	Method 1: MM1 would report the transaction with MM2 to ACT and would mark the report  “Riskless principal” 
	Method 2: MM1 would report the transaction with MM2 to ACT and would mark the report “principal” MM! Would also submit one of the following two reports of the trade with the customer as a “Riskless principal” 

1.	Clearing-only report if necessary to clear the transaction with the customer.
2.	Non-tape, non-clearing report (if a clearing entry is not necessary because for example, the trade is internalized) 

In some cases, a trade will be reported as part Riskless principal and part principal.

What is reported? 
	Nasdaq symbol
	Number of shares (round lots only)
	Price (usually does not include commission, markup, markdowns or services) 
	Whether the trade is a buy, sell, or cross (a cross (or dual agency)  is a transaction in which the broker-dealer is acting as agent for both the buyer and the seller. 
	Time of execution, if the trade is being reported more than 90 seconds after execution

	ACT rules require additional information above and beyond the minimum NASDAQ requirements. For example a sort sale must be reported in ACT as sell short or Sell short exempt 


Aggregate Reports: Under certain conditions, traders may aggregate reports for Nasdaq securities rather than report each trade separately. In all cases, must be same price, security and side of the market (buy/sell)

Openings- Orders received prior to the opening and executing at opening can be reported as one transaction. This also applies to orders received during a trading halt and executed together when trading resumes

Simultaneous transactions- When a number of orders are executed at the same time, such as when several orders with the same limit price are all executed, one trade report can be given Block execution of several orders are handled in the same way

Consecutive orders- If several individuals orders are executed in quick succession at the same price, making it impractical to report each separately, one report can be given. The orders must be executed within 60 sec on each other and reported within 90sec on the first execution in the group. Orders of 10,000 shares must be reported individually. But does not apply  to trades effected on the first day of secondary market trading following  and IPO 

Trade modifiers

.SLD - Late Trade Report- trades not reported within 90 seconds of execution, actual time of the execution must be appended
.T - After hours execution- time of execution must be included if not reported within 90 sec
.O – Price Override- used when the inside market changes within the 90-second reporting 
.B – Bunched Trade- used for several trades aggregated into one report
.SB – Late Bunched – used for a bunched trade not reported within 90 seconds
.C – Cash Trade- trade settle the same day as the trade date

Uniform Practice Code- sets the standards for clearing and settlement procedures to be used by members when dealing with each other. 

These standards enhance the efficiency of the intermember dealings regarding such things as settlement of contracts, deliveries, ex-dividends, due bills and marks to the market. 

Settlement:

Regular-Way Settlement:  in a regular-way transaction, a trade settles in 3 business days

Cash Contracts: Cash trades are transactions that settle on the same business day that the trade is executed. The seller must deliver the securities to the buyer on the trade date and the buyer must pay for the securities when it receives them.  Same day settlement is complete when the customer is recorded as owner of the stock, not when confirmations is sent as often is the case.

Seller’s Options: occurs when a seller does not wish to deliver the securities within three business days. Seller must specify the date on which the stock is delivered but cannot be less than 4 business days. The seller can deliver early if it notifies  one day before it intends to deliver. 

National Securities Clearing Corporation- is used by NASD members involving OTC securities, if the security has been qualified and both member firms are qualified as clearing members by the NSCC. 

Each participant submits data at the end of the day. NSCC attempts to match buying and selling side of each trade. 

	The next day, participants receive from the NSCC contract sheet, describing
§	The trades that compared correctly and are not ready to settlement
§	Uncompared trades which participants must reconcile 


Continuous Net Settlement (CNS): The process is possible when broker-dealers employ a clearing agency, EX NSCC and securities depository, EX. DTC )depository trust corporation to settle and clear trades 

For each security the member firm buys and sells, positions are netted out so that the firm owes or is credited with one securities or money balance each day for that issue. Fail to receive and deliver are taken into account in the netting process


Confirmations: UPC code: requires written confirms from NASD members be sent on the first business day. (normal Way) and must contain adequate descriptions of the security and transactions.

Cash transactions- confirms must be sent on the business day of the transaction. 

If the broker sends the Contra-broker (other side of the trade) a confirm but does not receive one in return. The broker must then send the contra-broker a DK (don’t know) notice, which questions the trade.  The contra-broker should review its records and if its an error it may be canceled with notification and approval of the NASD

Note: these are for physical confirms, not those compared electronically 

Delivery of Securities: purpose is to make sure that securities will be acceptable to the transfer agent. The transfer agent will make the final determination as to whether a security is a good delivery and may be transferred to the new owner. 

Endorsements and Assignments: 

1) A customer who sells a security is required to sign the certificate. Usual method is to sign the stock certificate on the back and then mail the certificate to the broker. 

2) Can send the certificate, unsigned, in one envelope and to send a signed stock power in a separate envelope

3) Enter a third party (broker) name on the back, then the broker-dealer would sign a power of substitution when it sends the stock to the transfer agent. 

Assignments on a security must be exactly as the name appears on the certificate. In addition the assignment must be guaranteed (a signature guarantee) by a member firm of the NYSE or commercial bank. The transfer agent will not accept a security for transfer without a proper assignment and guarantee. 

Ex.   Certificate is made out to  Ken s. Schmitz would need to sign the back   Ken s. Schmitz- Ken C. Schmitz and have both guarantee by a NYSE member firm or bank. This is generally referred to as an erasure guarantee 

Additional Documentation: 

If an account is register in the name of an executor or guardian and the security is signed by the executor or guardian, the transfer agent will accept the stock without requiring additional documents. 

Will not accept a dead person signature, but will accept if it is signed by a duly designated executor and accompanied by the necessary legal documents.  (death certificate , appointment of executor, state tax waivers, and affidavit of domicile.)

Certificates made out in the name of a company must be signed exactly as the name appears, without alterations or enlargements of any kind. A NASD member cannot accept unless the person signing is assured that the properly designated by the board of directors.  

Corporations can submit a corporate resolution and have the broker keep a copy of their resolution with all the transfer agents in advance.


Units of Delivery: Certificates must be in certain units. If not the buying broker does not need to accept the certificates. 

Stock Transactions: On stock transactions, deliveries may be for multiples of 100 shares. 

Cannot be in non round lots thus 300 share can be broken up by 200 shares and 100 shares but not 150 and 150.

Were as smaller units can be used if they can total 1000 shares. Ex 25, 50, 25 

Odd lots shares can be delivered in single certificates or multiple 

In partial stock delivery the remainder must be in a round lot


Bond Transactions- Bonds are good delivery in $1,000 denominations, or denominations of $100 or multiples aggregating to $1,000 (registered cannot be more than $100,000) 

Drafts that accompany the shipment of securities must be accepted only if presented during normal business hours. The acceptance of a draft prior to the settlement date, or the acceptance of a draft with irregularities, is at the option of the broker0dealer to whom the draft is delivered

26-29

Dividends

UPC- covers Ex-dividend, ex-right and ex-distribution procedures. 

To determine an Ex-dividend date, count back 2 business days before the record date. Any individual who purchased the stock are the Ex-dividend date would not receive the dividend. 

In the event that a trade occurs in time for a buyer to receive a dividend. (before the ex-date) but the sender fails to deliver the securities by the record date, a due bill will accompany the security when it is delivered. 

A due bill occurs when a dividend is due to the buyer, but is paid to the seller because delivery was not made in time to change the issuer’s records. 

Bond interest: 

UPC covers accrual of bond interest – On all bond transactions (other than for bonds trading flat- without accrued interest), the buyer of the bond will pay the seller the interest that has accrued from the last payment date to the day prior to the settlement date. 

Government bonds- computed on the basis of actual days elapsed for last payment

Corporate and muni- each month is considered 30 days, the first day is counted is the last date that interest was paid. 



Reclamation- The right to return or the right to demand the return of a security that is previously delivered and accepted

Requires the use of the Uniform Reclamation Form

Reason:
•	Wrong security delivered
•	Required due bill not attached
•	Signature issues
•	Mutilated securities is delivered without authentication by the transfer agent
•	If the transfer agent refuses delivery

Bonds- reclamation is permitted if the bearer bond is deliverered without all necessary coupons attached. 

If the bond has been called prior to delivery, unless the entire issue has been called for redemption or was traded as a called bond.

Close-Outs:
	UPC deals with Close-out procedures for failed trades, or trades that were not completed as agreed. 

Buy-in: occurs when a selling broker has failed to make proper deliver to a buying broker. The broker will then purchase the securities in the open market, charging the difference to the selling broker.  A buy in may not be done sooner than the third business day following settlement date. The broker whom delivery is due must send a buy-in notice to contra-broker no later  than 12 noon two business day before execution of the proposed buyin

Selling broker has right to notify that securities are in transit, the buyer must defer the close-out for 7 days

Sell-out: if a selling broker makes good delivery to a buying broker. And the buying broker refuses the accept ,the selling broker has the right to sell securities immediately, with out notice, and charge the buying broker with the loss

Notice of Close-out: NASD member that buys in or sells out another member must notify the other members of such action on the same day

Marks to the Market: a mark to the market occurs when a member firm is partially unsecured on an open contract with another member firm. The mark to the market is sent when there is a difference between the contract prices. 

B lends A $50,000; stock goes to $60,000 then B can request A to send $10,000 because of stock rise 

B lends A $50,000; Stock goes to $30,000 then A can Request B to send $20,000 in collateral

IF a member firm sends another member firm a mark to the market demanding the deposit of additional cash. 


When-Issued Securities: 

The UPC covers when, as and if issued and when, as and if distributed transactions 
These are transactions in securities, which are not yet available for delivery. 

One the securities are issued or distributed, then the NASD Operations committee will determine if the final form is essentially the same as original announcements. If they are then it will determine the settlement date, if not all transactions are canceled.

If the NASD does not determine settlement date then it will be on the business day following the seller giving the buyer written notice of its intention to deliver.

Clearing Agreements- It is an agreement between the introducing firm and the clearing firm. Where the clearing firm provides back office support for a fee.  The clearing firms actually holds the funds and securities and receive statement and confirms. 
	
If the Clearing firm is responsible for all record keeping, the introducing firm will provide the clearing member with complete details about customer accounts. Known a fully disclosed basis.

Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the firm and its registered reps comply with all relevant rules and regulation in the conduct of day-to-day business of the firm.

Recommendations: must be made based upon the facts disclosed by the customers regarding other securities holdings and current financial situation. Should not be based on profit but on fair dealings. Recommendations can then be made without the advance approval of the firm (unless policy dictates differently)


The following would violate fair dealing:

•	Recommending low-priced securities without obtaining information about the customer’s other securities holdings and financial situation. Thus making blanket recommendations of low priced securities is a violation because they are risky and not for everyone
•	Recommendation for purchases that are beyond the customers ability to pay.
•	Excessive activity in customer accounts (churning)
•	Trading in mutual fund shares which by their nature are not suitable trading vehicles or to buy hot issues
•	Use of discretion without authorization for the customer
•	Misuse of customer’ securities and funds
•	Unauthorized transactions by RR that are concealed from employer
•	Making guarantees as to future performance 
•	The use of promissory language by member firms
•	Paying someone to make a favorable comment about the security 

Recommendations must have reasonable basis and must include: 

•	The price at the time of the original recommendation
•	If the member firm makes the market of the member firm intended to buy or sell the security in its own account
•	If the member firm and its officers or partners own warrants, rights or options to acquire the security 
•	Whether the member was the manger or comanager of any of the issuer’s securities offerings within the past 12 months
•	Information supporting the recommendation must be provided or offered
•	Reference to past recommendations for a particular type of security must include all the recommendations for that type for the past year.
•	Each recommendation must be shown with date and the price at time of recommendation, as well as price range to be acted upon. 
•	Reference to past recommendations may not imply that they were profitable

Seminars and presentations: Fall under the NASD Conduct rules. Examples of these activities include:
 
•	Seminar conducted by a RR or principal that is open to customers
•	Principal appearing on TV discussing investments


Institutional customers: have at least $10 million invested in securities in its portfolio

Suitability obligations to institutional customers: RR cannot ignore suitability issues just because the customer is an institutional investor. There are 2 primary considerations in determining the scope of a member’s suitability in making recommendations.

1)	The customer’s ability to evaluate investment risk independently. Factors should be considered include:
•	Use of 1 or more consultants, investment advisers, or bank trust departments
•	General level of experience of the institutional customer in financial market and experience with instruments under consideration.
•	Customer’s ability to understand the economic features of the security
•	Customer’s ability to independently evaluate how market development would affect the security 
•	The complexity of the security 


2)	The extent to which the customer is exercising independent judgment: 

Any written or oral understanding that exists between the member and the customer regarding the nature of the relationship
The presence of absence of a pattern of acceptance of the member’s recommendations
The use by the customer of ideas, suggestions, market views and information obtained from other member or market professions.
The extent to which the member has received from the customer current comprehensive portfolio information in connection with discussing recommended transactions or the extent to which it has not been provided info regarding its portfolio or investment objectives


Regulation FD- Fair Disclosure

Concern that the selective disclosure of inside information to research analysts and large investors was unfair prompted the SEC to adopt Regulation FD. Regulation FD bars issuers from selectively disclosing nonpublic, material information to securities professionals, or it shareholder if it is ‘reasonably foreseeable” that they will trade on the information

REG FD applies to:
•	Senior company officials 
•	Those who regularly communicate with research analysts and investors
•	Company’s investment relations
•	Public relations

If any of the preceding people disclose nonpublic, material information to analysts or investors it must be disclosed to the public at large

Intentional disclosure- then the company must simultaneously disclose the info to the public

Unintentional the company has 24 hours to publicly disseminate the information  or until NYSE  opening which ever is later.

The company may file a Form 8-k with the SEC or by using some other method designed to reach a broad spectrum of the investing public 

REG FD does not apply to disclosures in normal course of business such as disclosure to company accountants, lawyers and investment bankers 

Best Execution:
Failure of member firms to use reasonable diligence to enable customers to obtain the best price on purchases and sales is inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.  Factors that are considered:
•	Price, volatility, and relative liquidity of the security
•	General character of the market for the security
•	Size and type of the transaction
•	# of markets checked
•	Accessibility of the quotation
•	Terms to conditions of the order as communicated to the members 

Interpositioning (prohibited) – is the insertion of a third party between the customer and the best market price to the detriment of the customer. 

Prohibition would not apply is member firm could prove that interpositioning helped provide the best price.

Lack of sufficient personnel to effectively execute an order would not be a reasonable basis for not obtaining the best price for a customer.

Front – Running (prohibited)

NASD member firms or associated persons cannot execute an order for which the firm has interest of discretionary authority with knowledge of material nonpublic info about an imminent block transaction in the security. 

The ban is lifted once the block transaction is made public. Unless it is a partial execution which the ban is still in effect until the entire block is traded

Block is considered 10,000 or more shares

Does not apply to:
SuperMontage (automatic execution)

Nasdaq, Consolidated tape, or options price reporting service 

Another example is a rep who holds a security and trys to build retail interest in the stock. Thus causing the price to rise

The restriction is also lifted for in-house use only research reports, not for external publication. 

Applies to NASD members in listed stocks in the third market and All Nasdaq stocks. As well as there derivatives. But does not address OTC securities although the NASD considers trading ahead as a violation of just and equitable principles of trade.

6.	Any other person exempted by the SEC. To date no other persons have been excluded

Registration: 

If a firm does meet the definition of an investment adviser, then it usually must register with t e SEC if it is a large adviser ($25 million  or more under management) or an advisor to a registered investment company. Smaller firms register with the STATES and are called RIA’s

Exempt advisors:
•	An investment advisor whose clients are all residents of the state in which the adviser maintains its principal office and who does not furnish advice about exchange traded securities. 
•	An investment adviser whose only client are insurance companies
•	An adviser who qualifies for the private adviser exemption. Have fewer than 15 clients in 12 months , do not hold themselves out to the public as investment advisor and don’t advise Registered investment companies.

Investment Advisory Contracts: Contracts between IA’s and their clients are subject to certain conditions under SEC rules. (contracts are not required by the SEC) 

•	Contracts must contain a provision that prohibits the adviser from assigning the contract without the consent of the client
•	If the investment adviser is a partnership, the contract must provide that the adviser will notify the client within a reasonable period of time after any change in the partnership
•	Performance-based fees are generally not permitted. These are fees that are based on a share of the capital gains or capital appreciation in the account.

Qualified Client: investment advisors may enter into performance-based fee relationships with qualified clients. (a person or company with at least $75,000 under management of an advisor or $1.5 million net worth

The Brochure Rule: an investment adviser is required to provide clients with a written disclosure statement, or brochure, containing information about its background and business practices. Such as a copy of Part II of SEC from ADV

Warp account clients receive a special brochure.

Written disclosure must be delivered to clients and prospective no less than 48 hours prior to entering into a written or oral advisory contract. It may be delivered no later than the time of entering into the contract if the prospective client has the right to terminate the contract without penalty within 5 business days. IA’s must also annually deliverer or offer in writing to deliver its disclosure document to its clients.

Except: the brochure rule does not apply to investment company clients or contracts for impersonal advisory services requiring payment of less than $200


Antifraud Provisions of the Investment Advisers ACT:
An investment adviser is a fiduciary who owes clients good faith and full and fair disclosure of all material facts. Thus it is an IA’s duty to disclose all material facts to clients, where if failure to do so would defraud or deceive a client or prospective.

The investment Adviser who is an RR- An investment advisor who is also a registered representative of a broker-dealer and provides investment advisory services outside the scope of employment with the broker-dealer must disclose to his advisory clients that the advisory activities are independent from his employment with the broker-dealer. 

Broker-dealer is receiving or is going to receive a fee from a customer for investment advice, and wishes to sell that customer a security, which it is underwriting. The broker-dealer is required to disclose to the customer. 

Soft dollar Compensation: some IA’s receive research and other services from broker-dealer in return for executing transactions for their advisory clients through the broker-dealer. Advisers are not permitted to receive reimbursements for travel expenses, furniture or equipment, since it would benefit the IA not the client. 

Step-Outs – transactions to fulfill their soft-dollar commitments. EX: Advisor might with to use BD 1 for execution but wants research from BD 2 the adviser could send an order for execution by 1 but directs 1 to step put a portion of the commissions in favor of BD2, who provides the adviser with research

Conflict of interest: the use of step-outs by mutual fund advisers to compensate broker-dealers for the sale of fund shares. If the adviser asked executing broker to step out of private client trades to compensate other broker-dealers for fund distribution. 

Confirmations: Both the executing broker-dealer and the broker dealer providing soft-dollar services to send a written confirmation containing all of the information required by the rule

Fraudulent Devices

No member shall effect any transaction in, or induce the purchase or sale of, any security by means of any manipulative, deceptive or other fraudulent device or contrivance.

Marking the close/ Marketing the opening: is a series of transactions, at or near the close of trading, which either up tick or downtick a security. This is a concern because it is not part of the normal forces of supply and demand.


Motivation: for marking the close

1)	Brokerage firms use a securities closing price in determining what their margin requirement s will be for their customers
2)	A security’s closing price is the price shown in the newspapers as the final price for the security for that trading session

Marking the open might occur when options expire, (contracts settle on opening prices) and certain trade strategies are executed as the market opens

Fair prices and Commissions

Members are not permitted to charge prices or commissions that are unfair or excessive. Thus developed the 5% markup policy

2 major questions: 
When is a markup of about 5% acceptable when may it be more, or when must it be less? 
How is the markup calculated when the prevailing inter dealer price is not obvious. 

Factors that influence the level of markups:

•	The type of security involved- Common stock is usually higher than bonds

•	The availability of the security in the market- if more effort is required to locate a particular security and execute  a transaction , a higher mark up is justified

•	The price of the security- % markups increase as price decreases

•	The amount of money involved in a transaction- 

•	Disclosure-  disclosure to the customer that the circumstance may warrant a higher-than normal markup helps to make the dealers case

•	The pattern of markups- mark ups in each transaction must be justified on its own merit. Patterns of persistent markups are treated most severely by the NASD

•	The nature of the broker-dealer’s business-  firms that offer services to customers, such as research.

Calculating Markups- 

Difference between interdealer ask and sales prices to customers 

Mark down
Difference between interdealer bid price and purchases from customers 

EX: MNOP inside market is 19.5-20.     Dealer X sells the stock fro $21 per share     markup is $1 or 5% 

This is acceptable only if the market for MNOP is active and competitive (it is not if one market maker dominates and controls the market. 


Policy Enforcement: When calculating markups, a broker-dealer must determine:

•	Whether it is acting as a market maker or not in the transaction
•	Whether the market for the stock is dominated and controlled rather than active and competitive 
•	Whether actual transactions or validated quotes may be used as the best evidence of the prevailing price


Prevailing Price- 

A quote is considered validated when:

•	A competitive market for the security exists.
•	Interdealer sales occur with some frequency, although not necessarily contemporaneously 
•	On the days when interdealer sales occur, they are consistently affected at prices at or around the quoted offers. 


 Suppose that a stock is being quoted at 24.50 –25 yet most interdealer trades are being negotiated through SuperMontage at 24.75. When calculation markups on sales, 24.75 should be used as the prevailing price, not 25

Proceeds Transactions:  are those in which the customer directs the member firm to sell a security and use the proceeds of the sale to buy another security.  The member firm should computer the markup in the same manner as if the customer had purchased for cash, for both the sale and purchase.

Exemptions: 	
•	Securities sold under a prospectus or an offering circular at a fixed offer price. 
•	Registered secondaries
•	Mutual funds 
•	Transactions on an exchange
•	Government securities 
•	Municipal bonds 

Charges for services: members are allowed to charge for services such as collection of dividends or safekeeping of securities, but the charges must be reasonable and may not unfairly discriminate between customers

Offering’ At the Market”: a Member firm that is part of a primary or secondary distribution of a security which is not approved on a national exchange may not be represented as being a “at the market” unless such there is a reasonable grounds to believe that an independent market for the security exists

Sharing in Accounts- NASD members may not share in profits or losses in a customer’s account unless the employee has made a financial contribution into the account and shares in the profits and losses in direct proportion to the employee’s financial contribution. The written authorization of the employee’s member firm must be obtained prior to engaging in this activity.

Guarantees- Employees of member firms may not guarantee against losses in customer accounts or transactions within customer accounts, nor reimburse a customer for losses.


Outside Business Activities

RR must provide written notice to their employing broker dealer before participating in any business activities outside the scope of that person’s. this is a guard against conflicts of interest.

Even part-time employment by a registered rep must be reported. 

Need permission first before working at any outside employment. 


Private Securities transactions: 

Private securities transactions are transaction outside the regular scope of an associated person’s employment with a member firm. This practice is some times called selling away.

Associated persons engaging in the following transaction  must provide written notice to the employing member.

If the person is receiving commission for the transaction. The member must approve and keep record on the members books

If the person will not be compensated for the transaction, the member may nevertheless require the associated person to adhere to specific conditions in order to participate in the transaction.

Personal transactions in investment company and variable annuity securities are not covered by the rule

Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) is a self- regulatory organization that governs broker-dealers and bank dealers that buy, sell, underwrite and provide advice about municipal securities; NASD acts as the enforcement agency for the MSRB for any NASD member that is also in the MSRB. 

Political Contributions (rule G-37)

Pay-to-play: - the practice of municipal securities dealers making political contributions in order to curry favor with politicians who might in return steer municipal securities underwriting business their way. 

A municipal finance professional (MFP) is defined as: 

•	Any associated person primarily engaged in the activities of a municipal securities representative. In a diversified broker-dealer where municipal securities are only part of its business, there might be many reps that are not MFPs since those activities are not primary aspect of their business 

•	Any associated person who solicits Municipal securities business. (negotiated underwriting activities, negotiated remarketing services, providing financial or consultant services to or for an issuer.

•	Direct supervisors of these associated persons

•	Any member of the executive or management committee of a dealer or of a separate identifiable department of a dealer bank. 

A MFP is considered to be any gift , subscription ,loan, or deposit of money of anything of value for:

•	Influencing any election for federal, state, or local office
•	Payment of debt incurred in connection with any such election
•	Transition or inaugural expenses incurred by the successful candidate for state or local office. 

Violations : a violation occurs if the MFP is not entitled to vote for the official and the MFP makes a political contribution. Also would be a violation if contribution to exceed $250 per election. 

If a violation occurs, the muni dealer is prohibited from engaging in municipal securities business with the issuer for 2 years. 

MPF employed by a dealer is not allowed to solicit or coordinate contributions for an official of an issuer with which the dealer is or is intending to do business.


Reported Related to Political Contributions

Firms must report on contributions to officials of issuers and on payments to political parties of states and political subdivision. 2 copies of these reports must be sent to the Board on form G-37/G-38 by the last day of the month following the end of each calendar quarter and must include: 

•	The name and title of each official of an issuer and political party receiving contributions or payments

•	The amount of the contribution or payment made and the contributor category of the persons and entities involved.

•	A list of issuers with which the dealer has engaged in municipal securities business, along with the type of municipal securities 

MFP or executive offices whom contribute is entitled to vote that do not exceed $250 do not need to be reported. 

Contributes made by executive officers that exceed $250 must be reported on Form G-37/G-38 although these contributions would not trigger the 2 year ban.

Dealers are not required to list the names of municipal finance professionals and exec offices on form G-37/G-38

Solicitation of Municipal Securities Business

A broker,dealer or municipal securities dealer may not agree to pay, either directly or indirectly any person who is no affiliated with the firm for soliciting municipal securities business on behalf of the firm

What is solicitation? Any direct or indirect communication by any person with an issuer for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining muni securities business.

Resolving Problems:

Code of Procedure:  describes the Association’s disciplinary process. These rules cover disciplinary actions by the NASD against member firms and their associated persons. Disciplinary actions may be taken by the NASD for violations of NASD rules, violations of SEC rules or failure to pay dues or assessments.

Disciplinary Proceedings: If the NASD’s Department of Enforcement believes that a member firm or associated person has violated a rule or law under its jurisdiction, the department will request authorization from the office of disciplinary affairs to issue a complaint. 

The respondent ( the firm or person named in the complaint). The response to the complaint within 25 days of receiving it. 

If the respondent fails to respond within 25 days, a second notice will be sent.  After 14 more day’s failure to answer will be treated as an admission by the respondent. 

The respondent may request a hearing. 

Hearing is held before a Hearing  Panel consisting of a Hearing Officer and 2 panelists, who are appointed by the NASD Chief Hearing Officer (an attorney employed by the NASD). The hearing officer must provide 28 days notice of hearing to the respondent.

The other members of the panel are persons associated with or retired from, member firms that have an expertise in the area in dispute and have server on local NASD committees.  

The Hearing officer may call a prehearing conference to prepare the parties for the hearing or to otherwise make the process more efficient. Documentary evidence is summated prior to the hearing. The hearing provides an opportunity for witness to testify under oath. Within 60 days after the Hearing  Panel has stopped accepting evidence, it must render a written decision arrived at by majority vote.

Anytime before hearing respondent can offer a settlement. If accepted, the respondent waives the right to appeal. If rejected, the hearing would proceed to a conclusion.

Sanctions: hearing panel may impose the following penalties:

•	Censure a member firm or an associated person
•	Fine a member firm or associated person
•	Suspend the membership of a firm or suspend the registration of an associated person, either for a definite period or until specified conditions are met. 
•	Expel a member firm or cancel its membership, revoke or cancel the registration of an associated person
•	Suspend or bar an associated person from association with any member firm 
•	Impose any other fitting sanction

Note: if the registration of an associated person is suspended, canceled, of revoked, that person may not be associated with a member firm in any capacity (including clerical or ministerial positions) 

Other than a bar expulsion, as sanction is effective 30 days after the respondent has received notice of a final disciplinary action. A bar or expulsion is effective as soon as soon as the decision is served on the respondent. If a broker-dealer is suspended must be treated as non-members.

Appeals- Once a decision has been rendered by the Hearing Panel, the respondent has 25 days to file an appeal with the NASD National Adjudicatory Council (NAC) 

If the respondent wins the Department of Enforcement has the right to appeal to NAC. 

The process of appeal places the decision in limbo

Appeals

Hearing Panelà NACà SEC à Fed Courts

Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent: (AWC)

Letter of Acceptance- The respondent signs a letter accepting a finding of violation, consenting to the imposition of sanctions and waiving the right to appeal. Letter would describe the rules violated and the sanctions to be imposed. If the respondent rejects the letter, disciplinary process would proceed as normal.

Investor Education: The NASD’s Investor Education and Protection Rules requires member firms, at least once every calendar year, to provide each customer, in writing, the following: 

•	NASD Regulation public Disclosure Program Hotline #
•	NASD regulation Website Address
•	A statement as to the availability to the customer of an investor brochure that includes the info describing the public disclosure program 

Code of Arbitration: 
The NASD Code of Arbitration is concerned with the settlement of disputes through arbitration. It is not concerned with discipline for violation of rules and regulations (covered by the CODE OF PROCEDURE)

Code of Arbitration:

Requires disputes be settled by arbitration including associated persons

Except in the case of statutory discrimination claims, including sexual harassment. 

When a Rep signs a U4 they are agreeing with this statement “ I agree to arbitrate any dispute, claim or controversy that may arise between me and my firm, or customer or any other person ,that is required to be arbitrated under the rules, constitutions or by-laws of the SRO indicated”

A public customer can bring a claim against a member but a member cannot bring a claim against a customer, unless the customer agrees. 

A customer may initiate arbitration by filing a Submission Agreement of Claim, and paying the deposit fee. Respondents may file a counter claim against the person initiating the arbitration

Does not apply to disputes between the NASD and member firms.

The NAC will appoint a panel of 1-3 arbitrators, depending on the $ amount.

If a customer is involved a majority of the arbitrators will be public arbitrators (not affiliated with the securities industry. 

Once notified of the composition of the panel, the customer has the right to reject the selection of an arbitrator on a peremptory basis and has the right to unlimited challenges for cause. 

Simplified arbitration is used if dispute does not exceed $25,000, a single arbitrator decides the case. Unless a public customer demands or consent to a hearing, or the arbitrator calls for a hearing. 

Any awards granted by the arbitrator must be paid within 30 days of determination or penalties may be assessed on late payments. 

Mediation: is an informal process in which 2 parties to a dispute attempt to reach a settlement without resorting to arbitration or litigation,  as well as a 3rd party a mediator. The mediator is a neutral person, knowledgeable about the securities industry., who attempts to facilitate the discussions and help the parties reach an agreement

Once 2 parties agree to mediation, they select a mediator (fee is split). NASD will suggest a mediator but it can be any mediator if the parties agree.  Both parties then provide the mediator with information they think is necessary to understand the dispute.

Then parties meet with mediator in a joint session. Each party presents its case then meet individually with the mediator in sessions called caucuses. 

Caucuses: is to help each party examine the strengths and weakness of the case, look at the risks involved, and consider possible settlements or resolutions. It is confidential

The mediation process will continue until:
•	The parties resolve the dispute through a written settlement
•	The mediator declares an impasse in the belief that continuing would be futile
•	Either party or the mediator withdraws, in writing the process

Partial Success Possible: Even if parties do not reach settlement, but often the 2 sides have a better understanding of the dispute. Sometime part of the issue will be settled leaving the rest for arbitration. 

The parties can be in mediation and arbitration at the same time. This way if mediation fails arbitration is ready to go. Mediation can even be started when arbitration has begun if the decision has not been rendered. 

Mediation vs. Arbitration
 	 
Mediation	Arbitration
A negotiation process between the 2 parties	A hearing process at which the 2 parties present their cases
Mediator attempts to facilitate a resolution-does not impose a settlement	Arbitrator imposes a binding settlement
Either part can withdraw if it chooses	Parties cannot unilaterally withdraw
Informal discussion process- parties may consider feeling and look for creative solutions in addition to evidence	More formal process- testimony under oath
Settlement must be mutually agreeable- compromise may be possible	Arbitrator decides the outcome- is more of a 'win or lose' decision
Parties must be willing to see strengths of the other sides' position	Useful where position of one or both parties is inflexible
Can be less costly and quicker than arbitration	Often more expensive and time consuming than mediation, but usually cheaper and quick than litigation
Process is private and any settlement is confidential	Hearing are private but the decision is public

The Net Capital Rule: It prevents a broker-dealer from becoming over leveraged by requiring a specific type of a aggregate indebtedness (AI)/ Net capital (NC) ratio at or below a certain value. A broker-dealer may not continue in business if this ratio becomes too large.

A broker-dealer’s AI/NC ratio is calculated from a trail balance. The trial balance is a listing of all accounts in affirms’s general ledger, divided into 2 groups: debit and credits. From the trail balance, the broker-dealer can construct an income statement, balance sheet as well  as net capital.  (trail balance must be prepared monthly)

In calculating the AI/NC ratio, not all debts or liabilities are included, only those that fit the def of aggregate indebtedness.  

Not all broker-dealer’s equity or net worth is counted, only liquid net worth.

Aggregate Indebtedness: AI- includes liabilities that are not secured by a specific asset of the broker-dealer. Other liabilities that would be included in aggregate indebtedness are:

•	Customer credit balances, which represent money owed to customers, available to them on demand
•	Accounts payable, such as bills owed to vendors. 

A broker-dealer may reduce its AI by the amount that is on deposit in the Special reserve Bank account. However if the firm has more deposited then required only the required amount may be subtracted


Determining the NET Capital Requirement:

A broker-dealer’s Net Capital (NC) msut in general be at least 1/15th  the aggregate indebtedness. (AI/NC&lt;15 to1).

Ex AI= $1,200,000  it must have a net capital of at least $80,000 (1,200,00* 1/15= 80,000)

First Year Requirement: Broker-dealers in  first year of operations must meet more stringent requirements of 1/8th AI. 

Minimum Dollar Requirement- In addition to meeting AI to net capital test. Firms must also maintain a minimum dollar amount of net capital. 


Type of broker-dealer	MIN $ amount of net capital
Carries customer accounts and receives or hold funds and securities	250000
Performs centralized clearing and account maintenance functions for customers who execute transactions through several other broker-dealers (prime broker)	1500000
Carries accounts but does not hold customer funds or securities	100000
Acts as a dealer (firm that executes more than ten transactions per year for their own investment account)	100000
introduces accounts on a fully disclosed basis to another firm and does not receive customer funds or securities 	5000
Introducing broker-dealer that receives customer securities for immediate delivery to a clearing firm	50000
Engages solely in the sale of redeemable shares of investment company securities (mutual funds) and operates on a subscription basis (does not accept customer funds- customer checks made out to the distributor)	5000
All other broker-dealers (including mergers and acquisitions firms and those doing business only in direct participation 	5000


Which ever of the requirement is higher should be met.

Limitations on Introducing Firms
Introducing broker-dealer may engage in a best-efforts or all –or- none underwriting only. 

The broker-dealer may accept checks made payable to the issuer only, and must forward such checks to the issuer promptly.

In order to participate in a firm- commitment underwriting, an introducing broker-dealers needs at least $100,000 of net capital, which would permit it to act as a dealer.

Introducing broker-dealers may only do occasional trades for their own accounts (no more than 10 a year). They may not act as dealers or market makers.

Market makers- is required to maintain a minimum dollar amount of net capital for each stock in which it makes a market. The amount required is $2,500 for each stock selling above $5 a share, and $1,000 for each stock selling for $5 per share or less not to exceed $1,000,000

Summary of Net Capital Requirements- must meet 3 basic requirements

1.	Net capital of at least 1/15 of AI (1/8 of AI in the first year of operation)
2.	The minimum dollar requirement, depending on the type of business
3.	The market-maker requirement, depending on the # of stocks in which market are made

Alternative Net Capital Requirement: Large broker-dealers may elect to be governed by an alternative net capital requirement. Under this approach a broker-dealer is required to maintain net capital of $250,000 of 2% of the aggregate debit items, which ever is greater

Computation of Net Capital 

Net Capital is computed by starting with net worth (equity) and making certain deductions based on the liquidity of the broker-dealers assets


Haircut: is the reduction of market value of securities is reduced because of possible liquidity should large amounts be sold at one time.

A haircut is applied to the net long or short position in each category of security held

The standard haircut for common stock held in a broker-dealer inventory is 15%. The standard 15% haircut can be considered an adjustment for average liquidity. If the broker-dealer owns securities that are more liquid than average, such as treasuries, the haircut is less than 15%. If securities are less liquid than normal, the haircut is larger than 15% 

If it is a limited market then the haircut is 40%.  

Open contractual commitments, such as underwriter commitments, require special deductions as well. 

Undue Concentration Deduction:  If a broker-dealers inventory contains 1 security that accounts for a significant % of the market value of its total inventory. This puts the firm at undue risk if the security declines. 

If any long or short is more than 10% of the broker-dealers net capital before the application of haircuts. 

The undue concentration rule requires an additional deducting on the amount in excess of the 10% threshold

If the securities falls under the general rule for haircuts, the percent applied is 15%

Otherwise the amount is ½ the normal amount. 

Undue concentration applies to the portion of an equity position in excess of $10,000 or the market value of 500 shares. In the case of debt securities, it only applies to the value of the position in excess of $25,000

EX peak holding inc is a broker-dealer 

20,000 shares of MXI at $15 a share = $300,000 value
5,000 share of PRV  at $8 a share =$40,000
6,000 shares of COL at $20 a share = $120,000

Peak holdings inc has a tentative net capital of $2,500,000.   10% of 2,500,000 is $250,000. Which are valued at $300,000 create and undue concentration.


Fail to Deliver: A fail to deliver occurs when a broker-dealer has sold stock to counter party, but has not delivered the stock by the settlement date. The fail to deliver is an asset (an account receivable) since the firm will be paid the contract price once delivery is made.

At first a Fail to deliver is treated as a ‘Good’ receivable, that is, no deduction is required.

After 4 business days (following the original settlement date) have passed, the fail to deliver is considered aged and a haircut is required. 

The broker-dealer is required to treat the aged fail to deliver like stock that is in its trading account, which usually means a 15% haircut.

The haircut is applied to the current market value of the stock, and additional adjustment is made for any unrealized profit or loss on the stock.

Securities Differences: is a discrepancy between the amount of the securities recorded on a broker-dealer’s books and the amount actually counted during periodic audits. If the amount is less than the amount on the books it is short securities difference. If the amount is greater than long securities difference. 

To Resolve: a broker-dealer would check the stock record, which would reflect the amount and location of stock, to make certain there are no errors in the entries. It would also check the receive and deliver blotter and delivery ticket.

A short securities difference is subject to a deduction if it has not been resolved within 7 business days/ Long securities difference involves securities that have not been resold they do not have any effect on net capital.


Subordination Agreement:

Normally a loan does not increase a broker-dealers net capital, since liabilities (the loan) and assets (cash) increase by the same amount, leaving net worth and net capital unaffected. 

Under certain conditions (RULE 15c3-1) they are called Satisfactory Subordination Agreements

2 types:

Subordinated loan agreement: (borrows cash only)

Secured demand note: (some of the assets provided are securities) 

If the loan includes securities subject to special haircut (ex OTC stocks w/ less than 3 market makers) the securities will usually be subject to the same haircut that applies to securities owned by the broker dealer. Securities normally subject to a 15% haircut (such as common stock) are subject to a deduction of 30% when used to back a secured demand note.

In order to be satisfactory for net capital, the subordination agreement must meet several conditions:

The agreement must be in writing, must indicate the duration of the loan, must be for a specific amount, and must acknowledge that the proceeds of the loan will be used in the conduct of the broker-dealers business and are subject to the risks of the business.
The lender must agree to subordinate its claim for repayment to the claims of all other creditors.
The loan must have a minimum duration of 1 year
The subordination agreement must be filed with the SEC 10 days prior to its effective date and with the broker-dealer’s examining authority (NYSE OR NASD) 30 days prior to its effective date.

If a subordinated loan is made for a period longer than 1 year, a provision for prepayment may be written into agreement ,but no prepayments may be made during the 1st year of the loan. 

Prepayment is no permitted if it would cause the broker-dealers ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital to exceed 10 to 1 or the firm’s net capital to fall below 120% of the minimum dollar amount required.
  

Temporary Subordination Agreement: a member firm may enter into a temporary subordination agreement. The broker-dealer is limited to no more than 3 such agreements in any 12 month period and the duration may not exceed 45 days. Usually permitted for underwriting purposes only

Debt-Equity Requirement:

A broker-dealers equity must be at least 30% of its debt-equity total. 

Debt to equity total is equal to its net worth plus the amount of its satisfactory subordination agreements. Preventing to much of its net capital for subordinated loans or secured demand notes.

The lender must be a partner or stockholder
The loan must have had an initial term of at least 3 years and must have at least 12 months remaining before it is due
The loan may not have any provisions for accelerated maturity (provisions that allow the lender to call in the loan early under certain conditions.) 

Customer Funds and Securities:

The customer Protection Rule- Contains provisions to ensure the safekeeping of both customer securities and customer funds. The rule defines a customer as any person for whom the broker-dealer holds funds or securities, but does not include another broker-dealer, a partner, officer, or director of the broker-dealer, or a subordinated lender. 


Customer Securities: A broker-dealer is required to promptly obtain and thereafter maintain physical possession or control of all fully paid and excess margin securities that belong to its customers.

Control of securities- means that the securities are under the direct control of the broker-dealer, good site locations include the office of the broker-dealer, in transit between offices and SEC approved depository.

Excess Margin Securities: are defined as those securities whose value exceeds 140% of the debit balance of a customer. EX customer owns $10,000 and has a debit balance of $5,000 would have excess margin worth $3,000 {10,000- (140%*5000}

A broker-dealer is required to computer daily as of the close of the preceding business day, the quantity of fully paid and excess margin securities that are in its possession or control and those that are not in possession or control. 

If a customer sells securities and fails to deliver the securities within 10 business days of settlement date, the broker-dealer must buy0in the customer. 


Customer Funds- Broker-dealers are required to maintain a Special Reserve Bank Account for the Exclusive benefit of Customers at a bank. The reserve bank account must contain cash or qualified securities (issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government) that are set aside for the benefit of customers. This account must be separate from other bank accounts of the broker-dealer and must be maintained solely as a reserve account for the protection of customers. The amounts on deposit in the Reserve Bank Account may not be used by the broker-dealer for any purpose.

The amount that must be on deposit is the difference between customer-related credits and debits. 

Timing of the Deposit: Computations must be made weekly, as of the close of the last business day of the week, to determine the amount of cash or qualified securities that must be on deposit. 

The required deposit must be made no later than 1 hour after the open of banking business on the second business day following the determination. 

If a broker dealer fails to meet this: it must notify the SEC by telegram immediately and follow up the telegram by notification in writing. Notice must also be sent to the broker-dealer’s examining authority. 

Under certain condition can be computed monthly but the broker-dealer must maintain a deposit equal to at least 105% of the amount otherwise required (only available to brokers whose ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital does not exceed 8 to1 and do not carry customer free credits exceeding $1,000,000

NOTICE: The broker-dealer must obtain written notification from the bank that the reserve bank account is for the exclusive benefit of customers of the broker-dealer and that the cash and qualified securities may not be used as collateral for a loan to the broker-dealer and is not subject to any charge, lien, or claim of any kind by the bank or any other person 

Exception: 
•	Broker-dealers that restrict their activities to the sale of mutual funds and that promptly transmit all funds and deliver all securities when received. 
•	Broker-dealers that clear their trades through another firm on a fully disclosed basis are not covered by the rule. 
•	Firms that carry no margin accounts, promptly transit all customer funds and deliver securities, do not hold funds or securities, or owe money or securities to, customers and effect all transaction for customers through one or more bank accounts maintained for that purpose. 

If a broker is exempt but wants to trade non-exempt it would need to obtain written approval of the NASD.

The NASD will base its decision on
•	Experience
•	Qualifications
•	Firms, procedures for customer safeguarding
•	Financial condition of Firm


Customer Free Credit Balance:

Requires a broker-dealer to advise customers regarding their free credit balance quarterly. Customers must receive written notice of the amount due to them along with a statement that the funds are payable to them upon demand.  

The notice must also state that the funds are not segregated and can be used in the conduct of the broker-dealers business. 

If a broker-dealer sent statements more than quarterly, notification of the free credit balances must be sent with each statement.

Exceptions: If the dealer segregates customer free credit balance so that the broker dealer cannot use the balance.

Securities Investor Protection Act

SIPA- establishes procedures for the protection of customer funds and securities in the event a broker-dealer becomes insolvent. Brokers that use the mail or other instruments of interstate commerce are required to be members of  SIPC.


SIPC provided coverage for each separate customer (retail and institutional) to a max of  $500,000 of which no more than $100,000 may be in cash. If a customer has a cash and margin account the combined amount would be $500,000. 

Joint Accounts would have separate coverage.

SIPC coverage applies to customer only. Does not apply if the customer hold the securities themselves. It does not cover commodities accounts

SIPC Procedures: If a broker fails, a trustee will be appointed by a federal court to distribute funds and securities to customers. The trustee is required to notify the broker-dealer’s customers of the insolvency and handle the orderly liquidation of the broker-dealer

Securities that can be specifically identified as belonging to a customer will be distributed to the customer without regard to the $ limits. 

If a customer has a claim for securities than cannot be specifically identified as being in the possession of the broker-dealer. The $ amount of the customer’s claim will be based upon the market value of the securities on the day a court is petitioned by SIPC to appoint a trustee. 

If there are insufficient securities in the possession of the failed broker-dealer , the securities on hand will be distributed to the claimants on a proportionate basis.

Customers who have claims that exceed the maximum dollar limits of SIPC coverage will rank with other general creditors for the balance of their claim. What ever is left over after $500,000 protection would be a general claim.

Other Filings 

Net Capital Violation-

If a broker-dealer’s net capital falls below the minimum requirements of Rule 15c3-1, The broker-dealer must file a notice on the day the violation occurs. The notice must state the broker-dealer’s net capital and net capital requirement. 

The same reporting requirement applies if the outstanding amount of subordinated debt exceeds 70% of the debt-equity total for period exceeding 90 days.

However, the broker dealer has a minimum net capital requirement of $250,000, since that dollar minimum is greater than 1/15 of its AI (1/15*$250,000)= $166,667). 120% times its minimum is $300,000. since the firm actually has only $290,000 of net capital, it would file an Early Warning notice with its DEA and the SEC within 24 hours.

Noncurrent Books and Records-  If a broker-dealer fails to maintain books and records as required by SEC rules, it must give notice to the SEC and its DEA that day. The broker-dealer must file a report within 48 hours detailing the steps being taken to correct the situation. The report must be transmitted by overnight delivery.

Packaged Products and Retirement Plans:


Packaged Product- is a security that allows customers to participate in various investments indirectly, usually thought a pool in which many investors participate. 


Investment Company Act 1940:
The purpose of the act is to protect the interests of small investors who are pooling their resources through investment companies. It is also concerned with conflicts of interest that the managers and distributors of these companies might have.


Investment Company: is a corporation or trust in which investors pool their funds to obtain diversification and professional management. Usually organized as corporations in the same manner as a business but some have been developed as trusts.

Requires that all investment companies register with the SEC. Except: those that do not made a public offering and:

•	Issuer have no more than 100 shareholders
•	Issuers whose shareholders are all qualified purchasers (qualified- individuals with at least $5million in investments and institutions with at least $25 million in investments.)

Annual Reports must be sent to the SEC and semiannual to shareholders. Must include:
•	Balance sheet
•	Income statement
•	List of securities owned
•	Statement of recent changes in portfolio


Classification of Investment Companies:

Face-Amount Certificate Company- issue certificates of the installment type that pay a stated amount at the completion of the plan. Not an important product today.

Unit Investment Trust (UIT) – is established under an indenture or similar instrument. UITs issue only redeemable securities ,each of which represents an undivided interest in a specific portfolio of securities. The portfolio remains fixed for the life of the fund. Has aboard of trustees.

Management company- holds securities on behalf of investors. The portfolio is managed by a investment adviser that follows an investment strategy that is defined by the investment company. Two subclasses: closed-end investment companies and open-ended investment companies (mutual funds) (can’t purchase on margin)

How mutual funds are organized: 

A mutual fund owns a portfolio of securities and in turn is owned by its shareholders. The fund represents a portfolio of securities that it holds for its owners, whose interest are protected by the funds directors or trustee

Board of directors- supervises the overall operations of the fund
Custodian- holds the cash and securities of the fund and may perform clerical functions, including acting as transfer agent, registrar, or dividend disbursing agent
Distributors and Dealers- Manages the sales effort and recruits other broker-dealers to help sell fund shares (may receive a discount on customer orders). Also sets the public offering price
Investment adviser or manager- manages the fund’s portfolio of securities.

REITS and an investment company register under the Investment company act of 1940 are specifically exempt fro the def of affiliate. 


Misleading Names- often have names that indicate their objective, frequently contains the name of the sponsor. The SEC sale names cannot be misleading.
 EX- Recommended, sponsored. 

Buying and Selling Mutual Fund Shares- mutual funds continuously issue new shares and will sell as many new shares as an investor wishes to purchase. Some mutual funds sell their shares directly to investors without using services of a broker-dealer. These funds do not need to assess a sales change and are called no load. 

The price charged when purchasing a mutual fund share is the public offering price (POP).

It consists of the next net asset value )NAV) per share calculated after receipt of the order, plus in some cases a sales charge.

Appropriate Recommendations: 

Sales Charges:  The distributor and dealer for a mutual fund are its sales force. The sales charge is the way that they are compensated. 

Traditional Front-End Load: Mutual funds that levy a sales charge (also called a load) often add that charge onto the price paid by the investor at the time of purchase. 

Investors pay the next NAV calculated after their order is entered (forward pricing). Then the sales charge is added. EX  NAV is $9.50 and Sales charge is .5 thus POP is $10.00 


Percentage Sales Charge- the sales charge is described as a percentage of the total price.

Reduced Sales Charge- most mutual funds offer breakpoints, where if the customer purchase a larger $ amount the sales charge is lowered

Letter of Intent: enables an investor to qualify for the discount made available by breakpoints without depositing the entire amount up front. The letter states the investor intents to invest the money needed over the next 13months. The letter may be backdated 90 days and is not binding to the investor. A portion of the investors holdings will be held in escrow in the event that he does not meet the requirement of the letter of intent and this will be used to pay for the increased sales charge


Dividend Reinvestment: Most mutual funds pay dividends and capital gains distributions to shareholders. Some mutual funds allow investors to reinvest dividends and distributions, without paying a sales charge (at NAV). Some funds, however do charge sales loads on reinvestment amounts. (New funds registered with Sec after April1,2000 are prohibited from assessing sales charges on reinvested dividends.

 Redeeming shares: 

Redemption- when an investor sells the shares back to the fund on any business day. Each share is redeemed at its NET Asset Value (NAV) 

NAV- to calculate NAV, the adviser adds up the value of all the securities in the portfolio (assets) and then subtracts any money owed by the fund (liabilities). That figure is then divided by the number of shares owned by investors at that time. Under the Investment company act of 1940 to pay proceeds of redemption within 7 days.

A funds NAV must calculate its NAV at least daily, but may be priced more frequently.

Redemption Fees: Most mutual funds redeem shares at NAV. However, some funds deduct a small redemption fee from this account. Such fees range from ½% to about 1% and is returned to the mutual fund portfolio. It is designed to discourage redemption to quickly. Some funds waive redemption fees after the shares have been held for a specific period. 

Deferred sales charges- Some mutual funds allow investors to buy shares at the NAV, they impose a sale charge when the investor redeems the shares, also called a back-end loaded fund. 

Often a contingent deferred sales charge is in effect when means that the longer you hold the fund the fee decreases


12b-1 Charges- deductions investors pay for distribution expense. (such as commissions and advertising)

Must has a 12b-1 plan in place which permits the board to enter into contracts with the principal underwriter that involves payments to the underwriter. The plan must be approved by shareholders and the funds board, as well as by the directs who are not affiliated with the fund, the adviser, or underwriter. 

The board must make quarterly reviews of the expenditures made under the plan. 

12b-1 charges are based on an annual rate, but the charges may be accrued and paid over shorter periods, such as monthly.

Service Fees- Service fees are charges deducted under a 12b-1 plan that pay for personal service or the maintenance of shareholder accounts. EX trailing commissions: RR who have sold fund shares to customers, receive these payments in years following the original sale. 


Asset Based Sales Charges- charges deducted from the net asset of an investment company to pay distribution expenses other than service fees. Such expenses might include ads, printing and mailing sales literature and prospectuses to those who are not current shareholders. It also includes the compensation of the underwriter, dealers and sales personnel


NASD Rules Regarding Investment Companies

Selling Fund Shares:  A written sales agreement must be in effect between an underwriter and an NASD member before the member may receive a discount on the sale of mutual fund shares. 

The selling agreement must set forth the amount of the discount and must include the condition that if the customer redeems shares within 7 business days after the purchase, the dealer must refund to the underwriter the full concession received on the original sale. The underwriter must then turn over to the fund both its share and dealer’s share of the sales charge.

Nasd members may not purchase fund shares at a discount from an underwriter unless the underwriter is  an NASD member. 

If a broker-dealer wishes to sell shares of open-end investment company, it must have a signed selling agreement.  Then it can buy for its own investment account or filling a customer. The broker-dealer may not buy the shares for inventory with intention to resell later. 

Selling Dividends- Selling dividends refers to the practice of inducing an investor to purchase a mutual fund on the basis of an impending dividend.  


Breakpoint Sales- The Nasd also prohibits breakpoint sales- which occurs when a registered rep sells mutual funds shares for an amount just below the point at which a sales charge discount would be earned without informing the client about the client about the availability of a sales breakpoint. 

Also can occur if funds are spread between mutual funds so that the amount is below breakpoints.

Sales Charges- NASD members may not sell mutual funds to customers if the sales charges are excessive. 

Funds without an Asset-Based Sales Charge:

The maximum sales charge that may be assessed for the sale of shares of a fund that does not charge an asset-based sales charge is8.5% of the offering price. In order to charge the maximum, the fund must offer:

1)	Quantity discounts (breakpoints)
2)	Rights of accumulation

For each of the preceding features that a fund omits, the maximum sales charge is reduced to a specified level. EX. If a fund does not offer dividend reinvestment at NAV, but does offer the other 2 features, the maximum sales charge is 7.25%

Funds With an Asset-Based Sales Charge: The max sales charge that may be assessed by a fund with an asset based charge depends on whether the fund pays a service fee.

•	If a fund pays a service fee, the max front-end or deferred sales charge resulting from and transaction is 6.25% of the amount invested.

•	If the fund does not pay a service fee, the Maximum front-end or deferred sales charge resulting from any transaction is 7.25% of the amount invested.

Limits on Asset-Based Charges: NASD members may not sell shares of investment companies that have asset-based sales charges in excess of .75% of average annual net asset value. Members are also prohibited from selling mutual funds that pay service fees of more than .25%


Use of the Term No-load:  RR may not refer to mutual fund as no-load or as having no sales charge if it has a front-end, deferred, of 12b-1 charge greater than .25% of average annual assets. 

Disclosure: Broker-dealers may not sell a mutual fund with an asset-based sales charge unless the prospectus discloses that long-term shareholders may pay more than the economic equivalent of a maximum front-end load permitted by NASD rules. This disclosure is not required in the case of money-market funds with asset-based charges of .25 of 1% or less.

Execution of Investment Company Portfolio Transactions: 

Anti-Reciprocal Rule- NASD prohibits member firms from selling open-end investment company shares because of commissions received or to be received from the investment company. The member firm may not pay additional compensation for the sale of certain investment companies, or prepare a preferred or recommended list of certain investment companies, in order to generate additional sales for the purpose of benefiting commissions. 

This prohibition does not in any way limit member firms from preparing a list of recommended investment companies if the purpose is to provide their employees and customer with information that will enable them to make decisions regarding purchase based on investment merit. The prohibition does not apply to paying extra compensation for the sale of investment companies in general if the purpose is to generate additional sales through bona fide sales contest that do not favor one investment company over another.

Member Compensation:

Mutual fund underwriters may not pay dealers a discount or concession in the form of a security, such as a warrant or stock. 

RR’s are prohibited, with certain exceptions, from receiving any compensation for the sales of investment company or variable contract products, either in cash or otherwise from anyone other than the NASD member they are associated.

Cash compensation- includes any discount, concession, commission, service or other fee, asset-based sales charge, loan, override, or cash employee benefit received in connection with the sale and distribution of investment company or variable contract securities.

Noncash compensation- any compensation that is not cash compensation, including meals, gifts, prizes, lodging.

De minimis Exception- 

 RR may accept gifts up to $100 per person per year from someone affiliated with the issuer or distributor. 

Other gift are acceptable as long as not excessive, for instance gifts, sports tickets, occasional means

Both assume that the gift is not based on selling or performance. 

 
Training and Education Exception: 

The NASD recognized that issuers and distributors (which it refers to as offerors) perform a valuable service when they provide training to member firms and their RR’s regarding the products and services they offer. 

Therefore, NASD rules permit offerors to pay or reimburse for meetings that serve and educational function.  However, there are several conditions

•	RRs must have their broker-dealer’s permission to attend the meeting
•	Attendance may not be tied to the achievement of a sales target
•	The location of the meeting must be appropriate
•	Payments or reimbursements for guests of RR’s such as spouses are not permitted. 

In House Incentive Programs: a broker-dealer is free to create its own internal sales programs with noncash incentives such as merchandise and vacation trips. A firm may even accept contributions by offerors to its noncash. One restrictions requires that a noncash incentive program for variable contract or investment company securities must be based on RR’s total production for all variable contracts or investment company products distributed by the broker-dealer. The credit earned by an RR toward the incentives offered must be equally weighted among the products in the program.

Retirement Plans:

Qualified Plan Accounts: are those that receive favorable tax treatment. To be considered qualified, the plan must meet the provisions set forth in the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) 

ERISA Sets IRS standards on:
•	Percentage of employees covered
•	Method of distributing benefits
•	Amount of contributions for each employee
•	Vesting of benefits
•	How the plan is funded

If established properly, a qualified plan will provide:
•	The employer will be allowed to deduct from income all contributions made into the plan
•	The fund established to provide the retirement benefits will be exempt from taxes 

Funding- A Qualified retirement plan may be established as either a defined contribution or defined benefit plan. 

Defined Contribution- requires that a specific annual percentage of contributions be made into the plan by the employer on behalf of each employee. Total Dollar contribution is based on the employee’s annual compensation.

Defined benefit plan: promises to pay the employee a specific amount each year once the employee retires. The benefit payment is usually based upon age, years of service, and salary history. Actuarial calculations are used to determine the amount that an employer must deposit each year to provide fro the retirement benefit specified by the plan.

Defined benefit plans allow for larger max contributions than defined contribution plans. 

Vesting: specific amount an employee is entitles to keep when withdrawing from a plan. The employer may choose one of the vesting schedules put forth by the IRS. One schedule provides for full vesting after five years of service, the other provides for full vesting after 7th years and at least 20% by the 3rd year.

Participation-  21 years old and at least 1 year of service. Part-time worker (less than 1,000 hours). A plan may set a waiting period if there is 100% immediate vesting after 2 years

Plan Administration- 

•	All qualified plans must be in writing and communicated to employees. 
•	Plan assets must be held in a trust or custodial account. 
•	A trustee, who has exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control assets (must be named in writing) 
•	General principles such as diversification, liquidity of investments, obtaining a reasonable return 

Tax Treatment of Employees- The contribution made on behalf of the employee is not included in the employee’s income. The employee will recognize these contributions as income when the money is distributed to the individual. Income earned while fund is accumulating the plan is tax-deferred until distributed to the employee. 

Corporate Pension Plans- may be established as defined benefit or defined contribution. 
For all employees who are 21 years old and have worked for at least 1 year.

Contributions made into the plan are not contingent upon the employer’s profits. 

Pension plans are often noncontributory, meaning the employees may not make contributions into the plan. (those that do allow employee participation are normally after-tax dollars.


Profit-sharing plans- Defined contribution plan, fund must be allocated to participants in a nondiscriminatory fashion based upon a predetermined formula. An employee is not required to contribute if they are not profitable

401(k) plans: an employee makes contributions to an employee trust. Contributions are not included in the income of the employee and accumulate on a tax-deferred basis. Employees may elect to contribute part of their salary into the plan on a pretax basis. As with all ERISA plans, early withdrawals from a 401(k) plan (before age 59 ½) are subject to a 10% penalty tax

403(b) Plan: are deferred retirement plans that may only be established by certain tax-exempt, nonprofit organizations covered under section 501(c) (3) ,such as churches and public school systems. They can also be referred to as Tax-deferred annuity (TDA) ,Tax-sheltered annuity (TSA) or qualified annuity.

Employees may exclude contributions from their taxable income provided they do not exceed certain limits. Employers may match employee contributions.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) –Provides similar benefits similar to those of a profit-sharing plan except that employer contributions are invest in the stock of the employer. 
Advantages: 
•	Employer is the ability to receive a tax deduction based on the FMV of the stock without making a cash outlay.
•	Can increase employee morale and motivation, but still has risk of decline in share value

Keogh (HR-10) Plans: is restricted to self-employed. An individual who is employed by a corporation , but who has additional income from self-employment. Can set up a Keogh plan for the amount earned from self-employment.


If a Keogh Plan is set up it must include employees in the plan that meet certain requirements. (1 year or longer of work, 21 years of age, if they work a total of 1,000 hours or more during the year. Contributions fro employees must be at the same rate as fro the employer. 

In order to claim a deduction for a contribution into a Keogh plan, the plan must be started prior to the end of the tax year (DEC 31) Contributions may be made up until the tax return is due. 

Contributions (including employees) may be claimed as a deduction on the self-employed individual’s tax return.

The contribution, plus any investment gains, accumulate on a tax-deferred basis until the money is withdrawn from the account. Distributions are taxed as ordinary income 

An early withdrawal from a Keogh Plan would occur before the age of 59 ½. This would result in a penalty of 10% of the amount withdrawn, as well as ordinary income tax but are allowed for death and disability.

The Keogh plan allows a max contribution of 100% of compensation or $45,000 which ever is less. The amount deductible is limited to the lessor of 20% of the compensation or $45,000. 

Individual Retirement Account (IRA) 

Anyone who receives compensation for working during any year (including wages, salaries, commissions, and professional fees) is eligible to establish an IRA. (DOESN’T include interest, dividends, or capital gains made from investments. 

An individual may establish an IRA even if covered under an employer’s retirement plan. 

A husband and wife, if both are employed, may each set up their own IRA.

The Max individual contributions to and IRA is the less or 100% annual compensation:

$4000 in 2005-2007
$5000 in 2008 and thereafter

If an IRA is funded in excess, a 6% penalty is assessed on the contribution. (excess contribution is not tax-deductible and income earned on the excess contribution)

Additional individuals over 50 years old, there is catch up provision that allows extra money to be contributed towards an IRA. 

$500 in 2004-2005
$1000 in 2006- thereafter

For individuals covered by an employee’s qualified plan, limits are placed on the deductibility of contributions once income reaches a certain threshold. As income rises about this level ,the amount that may be deducted is reduced (phased out) until contributions cease to be deductible above a specified income level.

IRAs for Married Couples- If a husband and wife are both employed, each may make contributions into each one’s own IRA according to the contribution limits previously discussed. Therefore, if they file a joint tax return, a MAX deduction of $8,000. If either spouse is cover by an employer’s plan, deductibility of the contribution may be limited or prohibited.  

If an individual has a nonworking spouse, the individual may contribute an additional $4,000 into plan on the spouse’s behalf. This would raise the max to $8,000 for a couple
The contribution would have to be in separate accounts. The extra account is called a Spousal IRA.

Maintaining and Liquidating an IRA- an individual may establish an IRA up until the time the person’s tax return is due (April 15th) for the given tax year.

Contributions made into an IRA must be made in cash. Contribution may be invested in various instruments such as stocks, bonds, annuities, mutual funds, or U.S. gold coins. 

IRA’s cannot be invested in life insurance polices, collectibles such as art, antiques, stamps 

An IRA may be maintained at a brokerage firm or bank, which acts as a custodian for the account. The IRA decides how the funds will be invested. The brokerage firm or bank acts only as trustee

Contributes and investment gain in an IRA accumulate on a tax-deferred basis until the money is withdrawn from the account. Distributions are allocated between pretax and after-tax monies and can be withdrawn in lump sums or periodically. 

The funds in an IRA maybe withdrawn without penalty once the owner of the account reaches the age of 59 ½. Prior to 59 ½ are Premature and subject to a 10% penalty in addition to the taxes on the income.

•	Circumstance for early withdrawal (no penalty)
•	Death
•	Disability or mental incompetence of account owner
•	Payment of certain medical expenses
•	Payment of first-time home buyers expenses

It would still be considered for income taxes

Withdrawal of funds from an IRA must begin by April 1st following the year the person attains the age of 70 ½. If not a penalty of 50% can be assessed if the person is not following an actuarial life expectancy table. 

Rollovers

An individual is permitted to move an investment from 1 type of retirement plan to another without incurring any tax liability. Once a distribution check is reinvests but must be within 60 days. And can only be done once every 12 months. (applies to Ira and voluntary deductible contributions made to an employer

If a roller is initiated by a distribution from a qualified plan, the distributing firm must withhold 20% for tax purposes. 

If it is from IRA to Ira withholding is not needed

Direct rollover- is from one trustee to another, no 60 day time limit and rollover limit are not in effect. Or withholdings

Roth Ira  

Contributions are not deductible- but certain withdrawals are tax free. Withdrawals are not included in an individuals gross income and are not subject to the 10% withdrawal penalty (both earning and contributions)

Qualified Distributions:
•	After 59 ½
•	To beneficiary of investors estate after death 
•	Because the taxpayer is disabled
•	To purchase a principal residence as a first-time home buyer (subject to a $10,000 limit) 

However it is not qualified if the distribution is within 5 years of establishing the account.

Contribution Limits :

Same as traditional. But after and individual reaches age 70 1/2 , the minimum distribution requirement at 70 ½ does not apply


Not Eligibility:

Single: $99,00- $114,000 and greater

Joint $156,000-$166,000 and greater

Coverdell Education IRA’s: This is a way of saving money for a child’s college education. Anyone with a gross income is within certain limits, may contribute a maximum of $2,000 per years into an account established for the benefit of a child under the age of 18. Same income limits are those for a Roth IRA. Total of all contributions from various people to one child’s account may not exceed $2,000.

•	Contribution is not tax-deductible. 
•	Grows tax-free if used to pay for child’s educational expenses. 
•	If not used for education subject to a 10% tax penalty and ordinary income tax
•	If not used by beneficiary’s 30th b-day it must be distributed and is subject to penalty 

Section 529 Plans: 

Contributions are made with after-tax dollars 
Earnings are tax-deferred. 
Qualified withdrawals, however that are used for educational purposes are tax-free
States determine the specific plan rules 

Nonqualified Plan Accounts:  (do not have to meet ERISA requirements regarding employee coverage, contributions limits and vesting. 

Payroll Deduction plans: 

Most payroll deductions involve the purchase of life insurance through payroll deductions. These voluntary plans may also be funded thought purchase of mutual funds and variable annuities. (often are given a group discount on sale charges)


Deferred Compensation:

These are contractual arrangements under which select individuals agree to defer receipt of part of their compensation until retirement, disability, termination, and death. Deferred compensation is discriminatory and has been used to shift income from a high tax bracket to one where tax rate was lower.

Do not require the approval of the IRA.  The employer selects who is eligible for inclusion in the plan (not required to follow ERISA)

BAD BOY clause is a provision in most deferred compensation agreements that restricts the rights of employee from receiving deferred monies. This is to protect the employer from paying employees who violate company policy or trust. Violations of such clauses result in the forfeiture of some or all benefits payable from that date on. Also if the firm fails chances are deferred compensation is lost because its is unsecured.

Employer’s contribution  is no tax-deductible during the deferred period, but can be claimed on payout. The employee has no right to the contributions and pays no tax during the deferral period. 


NASD Rules Regarding Variable Products:

Variable products include: variable annuities and variable life insurance. These products are funded through separate accounts that are subject to many of the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Selling Agreements: NASD members that are principal underwriters may not sell variable contracts through another broker-dealer unless that firm is also an NASD member and has a sales agreement. 

The sales agreement must provide that commissions will be returned to issuing insurance company if a variable contract is tendered fro redemption within 7 business days after the acceptance of the contract application


Redemptions: If an insurance company does not promptly make payments to contract owners who properly tender requests for partial or total redemptions, NASD members are not allowed to participate in the sale of variable contracts of that company.

Other Important facts about variable Contracts:  The percentage of the sales charge on variable contracts is computed on the amount deposited in the separate account, plus the sales charge. The issuer must be paid promptly and the NASD must be notified if payment is not received within 10 business days. Also NASD members may not sell the contract at a price that is lower than the price paid by customer.


Communications With the Public about variable life insurance and variable annuities. 

Variable a products have special standard regarding advertising and sales literature. 

Identification: To prevent misunderstanding communications about variable annuities or variable life insurance must clearly identify the product.  If a proprietary name is used, there must also be a general description of the product.

Liquidity: Withdrawals from variable products can sometimes involve substantial charges or tax penalties. Therefore, communications about these products may not represent or imply that they are short-term, liquid investments. Any information presented about liquidity of access to investment values must be balanced by information about negative impact of early redemption. In case of variable life insurance, discussions of loans and withdrawals must include an explanation of their impact on cash values and death benefits. 

Guarantees: Some aspects of variable products are guaranteed while other aspects are not. When guarantees, their safety cannot be over-emphasized, sine they depend on the claim-paying ability of insurance.

Communications may not represent or imply that a guarantee applies to the investment return or principal value of the separate account, or that the insurance company’s ratings apply to separate


Hypothetical Illustrations for Variable Life Insurance: NASD rules regarding communications with customers strictly forbid any discussions of performance that might be interpreted as projections or predictions. The SEC and NASD allow the use of hypothetical illustrations in presentations concerning variable life insurance, but have established guidelines for their use. 

An illustration may use an combination of assumed investment returns up to and including a gross rate of 12%, provided that one of the return is a 0% gross rate. The 12% must be within a reasonable area given market conditions. The return in the illustration must reflect the maximum mortality and expense charges. The Illustration must include an explanation that it is hypothetical and does not project or predict actual results.


Other Content Restrictions: Comparisons between variable products and other types of investments may be made as long as they are clear, fair, and balanced. Material for variable life insurance that discusses its investment features must balance that presentation with a discussion of its insurance features. However, communications for single premium variable life insurance may emphasize its investment features as long as it also includes an adequate explanation of its life insurance aspects.

So far the female G-spot is identifiable as the ''internal'' part of the female clitoris. It varies in size and sensitivity and creates the same stimulation as the external part of the clitoris. The term G-spot comes from the name '''Gräfenberg spot''' assumed to be identified in 1944 by Ernst Gräfenberg, later to be disclosed in 1982.

Because the clitoris is an organ that spreads internally, there is reason to assume that it can also be the causes of various forms of female ejaculation, notably the urethra and other associated secretion glands. During orgasm the G-spot, including the whole of the clitoris, can create the notable spasms in the vaginal area that have been identified in certain observations. These spasms are muscular reactions, which can also be observed in other parts of the body. This is what makes the G-spot the centre of many discussions about its existence, and how it causes various states and intensity of orgasm.

In this module, we will introduce the basics of Punjabi grammar. The most important concept dealt in this module concerns the parts of speech. The basic concepts of number, gender, person and case will be introduced. We will also give rules of inflection and declension. Many examples will be given to illustrate the conceptual text. Where many different gramatical derivations are possible we will provide tables to illustrate patterns. We will also be concerned with syntax of the Punjabi sentence, at a fair length. It is, however, not necessary to go through the grammar lessons before learning other modules as they all contain enough material to make them independent of this more detailed grammar module.

__NOTOC__

== ਨਾਂਵ (Noun) ==
ਨਾਂਵ (Noun) is a word used to identify a person, a place, a thing or even an abstract idea. It may be used for a specified individual entity or a group or a class of such entities. In this section we shall examine the form of the noun of various classes and how nouns of a particular class are formed from the basic noun form. Let's first take the gender of a noun. We start with ਪੁਲਿੰਗ ਨਾਂਵ (masculine noun) and see how ਇਸਤਰੀ ਲਿੰਗ (feminine noun) is derived from it. We shall also see how the number of the noun in both genders affects the noun form.

== ਸਧਾਰਨ ਨਾਂਵ (regular nouns) ==
A large number of masculine nouns end with kanna (ਆ). We classify such nouns as regular masculine nouns or ਸਧਾਰਨ ਪੁਲਿੰਗ ਨਾਂਵ. '''ਘੋੜਾ'''(horse), '''ਬੋਤਾ''' (camel) and '''ਸੋਟਾ''' (stick) are examples of regular masculine nouns. The reader would have noted that even though stick is a non living thing still '''ਸੋਟਾ''' is masculine in Punjabi. The gender of such words is determined by the word form rather than by the gender of what it represents. Regular masculine nouns are governed by the following general rules.&lt;br&gt;
'''Rule 1''' : The feminine (ਇਸਤਰੀ ਲਿੰਗ ) form of ਸਧਾਰਨ ਪੁਲਿੰਗ ਨਾਂਵ  or regular masculine nouns is obtained by changing ਆ to ਈ. 
:#ਘੋੜਾ - ਘੋੜੀ
:#ਬੋਤਾ - ਬੋਤੀ
:#ਸੋਟਾ - ਸੋਟੀ
'''Rule 2''' : The plural (ਬਹੁ ਵਚਨ) form of ਸਧਾਰਨ ਪੁਲਿੰਗ ਨਾਂਵ  or regular masculine nouns is obtained by replacing ਆ with ਏ&lt;br&gt;
:#ਘੋੜਾ - ਘੋੜੇ
:#ਬੋਤਾ - ਬੋਤੇ
:#ਸੋਟਾ - ਸੋਟੇ 
'''Rule 3''' : However when the regular masculine noun is followed by a [[#ਸੰਬੰਧਕ (Postposition)|postposition]] the above plural form becomes singular and the plural is formed by replacing ਆ with ਇਆਂ. For example:
:#'''ਘੋੜੇ''' (singular) ਨੇ ਘਾਹ ਖਾਧਾ। - '''ਘੋੜਿਆਂ''' (plural) ਨੇ ਘਾਹ ਖਾਧਾ।
:#'''ਬੋਤੇ''' (singular) ਨੇ ਉਠ ਕਿ ਤੁਹਨਾ ਸ਼ੁਰੂ ਕਰ ਦਿਤਾ। - '''ਬੋਤਿਆਂ'''(singular) ਨੇ ਉਠ ਕਿ ਤੁਹਨਾ ਸ਼ੁਰੂ ਕਰ ਦਿਤਾ।
:#ਉਸਨੇ '''ਸੋਟੇ''' (singular) ਨਾਲ ਸੱਪ ਮਾਰਿਆ। - ਉਸਨੇ '''ਸੋਟਿਆਂ''' (singular) ਨਾਲ ਸੱਪ ਮਾਰਿਆ।
'''Rule 4''' : The plural (ਬਹੁ ਵਚਨ) form of the feminine (ਇਸਤਰੀ ਲਿੰਗ ) form of ਸਧਾਰਨ ਪੁਲਿੰਗ ਨਾਂਵ  or regular masculine nouns is obtained by adding ਆਂ to the feminine form.&lt;br&gt;
:#ਘੋੜਾ - ਘੋੜੀ - ਘੋੜੀਆਂ
:#ਬੋਤਾ - ਬੋਤੀ - ਬੋਤੀਆਂ
:#ਸੋਟਾ - ਸੋਟੀ - ਸੋਟੀਆਂ

== ਅਸਧਾਰਨ ਨਾਂਵ (irregular nouns) ==
Masculine nouns which don't end with kanna (ਆ) are classified as irregular masculine nouns or ਅਸਧਾਰਨ ਪੁਲਿੰਗ ਨਾਂਵ. Irregular masculine nouns are not governed by any uniform rule. Still the following general rules cover a large portion of irregular masculine nouns.&lt;br&gt;
'''Rule 5''' : The feminine form of the irregular masculine nouns ending with ਈ such as ਸਾਥੀ is obtained by replacing ਈ with ਅਣ or ਅਨ.
:#ਧੋਬੀ - ਧੋਬਣ
:#ਮਰਾਸੀ - ਮਰਾਸਣ
:#ਖਿਡਾਰੀ - ਖਿਡਾਰਨ
:#ਪਟਵਾਰੀ - ਪਟਵਾਰਨ
'''Rule 6''' : The feminine form of some irregular masculine nouns ending without vowel such as ਕਬੂਤਰ is obtained by adding ਈ to it.
:#ਕਬੂਤਰ - ਕਬੂਤਰੀ
:#ਕੁੱਕੜ - ਕੁੱਕੜੀ
:#ਦੇਵ - ਦੇਵੀ
:#ਪੁਤਰ - ਪੁਤਰੀ
'''Rule 7''' : The feminine form of some irregular masculine nouns ending with ਰ such as ਸਰਦਾਰ is obtained by adding ਨੀ to it.
:#ਸਰਦਾਰ - ਸਰਦਾਰਨੀ
:#ਲੰਬੜਦਾਰ - ਲੰਬੜਦਾਰਨੀ
:#ਸ਼ੇਰ - ਸ਼ੇਰਨੀ
:#ਮੋਰ - ਮੋਰਨੀ
'''Rule 8''' : The feminine form of some irregular masculine nouns is obtained by adding ਣੀ to it.
:#ਊਠ - ਊਠਣੀ
:#ਸੱਪ - ਸੱਪਣੀ
:#ਸਾਧ - ਸਾਧਣੀ
:#ਮਹੰਤ - ਮਹੰਤਣੀ
'''Rule 9''' : The feminine form of some irregular masculine nouns is obtained by adding ਆਣੀ to it.
:#ਜੇਠ - ਜੇਠਾਣੀ
:#ਪੰਡਤ - ਪੰਡਤਾਣੀ
:#ਨੌਕਰ - ਨੌਕਰਾਣੀ
:#ਸੇਠ - ਸੇਠਾਣੀ
The above are some examples in which derivatives obtained by change of gender follow certain rules. However not all such derivatives follow definite rules. This feature is not unique to Punjabi and such exceptions are found in almost all modern languages. It takes lots of practice to master the language and such exceptions are the root cause of such difficulty. In a way this is also the beauty of the language. We are providing here some examples in which none of the above rules are applicable to derivatives obtained by change in gender. Many such examples are found in nouns representing human relationships.
:#ਪੁਤਰ - ਧੀ
:#ਜੀਜਾ - ਸਾਲੀ
:#ਪਿਉ - ਮਾਂ
:#ਮੁੰਡਾ - ਕੁੜੀ
We shall next examine how derivatives are formed to obtain plural of irregular masculine and feminine nouns.&lt;br&gt;
'''Rule 10''' : The plural forms are obtained by adding ਆਂ to the masculine nouns.
:#ਹੱਥ - ਹੱਥਾਂ
:#ਆਦਮੀ - ਆਦਮੀਆਂ
:#ਵਪਾਰੀ - ਵਪਾਰੀਆਂ
:#ਮੁਲਾਜ਼ਮ - ਮੁਲਾਜ਼ਮਾਂ
However there are exceptions to the above general rule. In the following sentences '''ਹੱਥ''', '''ਆਦਮੀ''', '''ਵਪਾਰੀ''' and '''ਮੁਲਾਜ਼ਮ''' have been used as plural forms of these nouns even though we have seen above these are singular forms.
:ਮੇਰੇ '''ਹਥ''' ਰੁਝੇ ਹੋਏ ਹਨ। - ਸਾਰੇ '''ਆਦਮੀ''' ਚਲੇ ਗਏ। - ਦੋਨੋ ਵਪਾਰੀ ਚਲਾਕ ਸਨ। - '''ਮੁਲਾਜ਼ਮ''' ਹੜਤਾਲ ਤੇ ਸਨ।
Now compare these with the following sentences:
:ਉਸਦੇ '''ਹੱਥਾਂ''' ਵਿੱਚ ਲੱਡੂ ਸਨ। - ਸਾਰੇ '''ਆਦਮੀਆਂ''' ਨੇ ਖਾਣਾ ਖਾਧਾ। - ਦੋਨਾਂ '''ਵਪਾਰੀਆਂ''' ਨੇ ਚਲਾਕੀ ਕੀਤੀ। - '''ਮੁਲਾਜ਼ਮਾਂ''' ਨੇ ਹੜਤਾਲ ਕੀਤੀ।
Here regular plural forms '''ਹੱਥਾਂ''', '''ਆਦਮੀਆਂ''', '''ਵਪਾਰੀਆਂ''' ਅਤੇ '''ਮੁਲਾਜ਼ਮਾਂ''' have been used. The reason for such differential treatment is that in the second case each of the nouns is followed by a preposition while this is not so in the first case. It thus follows:&lt;br&gt;
'''Rule 11''' : The singular form when not followed by a preposition, singular form when followed by a preposition and plural form when not followed by a preposition are the same. The plural form when followed by a preposition is obtained by adding ਆਂ  to the noun.

== Table of declensions ==
We have examined above some rules that the nouns follow when assuming different cases as well as number and gender. We now present a complete table of declensions of the noun ਮੁੰਡਾ (boy) and its feminine form ਕੁੜੀ (girl).

|}

A notable feature of the above case forms is that all of them are formed by adding additional words following the noun except the subject case which does not take any additional words. However there is one notable exception in the case of relational case where the additional words ਵੇ, ਨੀ, ਏ and ਓ precede the noun instead of following it.

__NOTOC__
== ਪੜਨਾਂਵ (Pronoun)==
Pronoun is a word that replaces a noun to avoid its repetitive use. It greatly adds to the beauty of the language and enhances its flow and usability. Pronouns are classified into six groups which we shall now describe. We shall also examine the rules that govern their use.

=== ਪੁਰਖਵਾਚਕ ਪੜਨਾਂਵ (Personal pronoun) ===
Personal pronouns are those which are used to refer to a person or persons. Punjabi personal pronouns are inflected for number and case but uninflected for gender except possibly for relational case discussed below. ''Punjabi does not have a specific pronoun for the third person, the remote demonstrative pronoun ਉਹ is used, instead.'' The basic forms of these pronouns used in Punjabi are ਮੈਂ (I) and ਅਸੀਂ (we) for first person, ਤੂੰ (you, singular) and ਤੁਸੀਂ (you, plural) for second person and ਉਹ (he, she, they, both singular and plural) for third person. ਆਪਾਂ is a very exceptional personal pronoun which stands for the first person and second person together and is always plural. The number/case variants of Punjabi personal pronouns are formed in two ways by adding suffix to the basic pronoun or by adding a postposition to it. 

;'''Objective case derivations''' : The suffix '''ਨੂੰ'''(to) is added to personal pronouns to obtain the objective case (ਕਰਮ ਕਾਰਕ). Thus 
:* ਮੈਂ + ਨੂੰ = ਮੈਨੂੰ
:But when personal pronoun ਤੂੰ combines with ਨੂੰ it changes form to ਤੈ. Thus 
:* ਤੂੰ + ਨੂੰ ⇒ ਤੈ + ਨੂੰ = ਤੈਨੂੰ
:The third person ਉਹ of subjective case becomes ਉਸ to combine with ਨੂੰ and hence
:* ਉਹ + ਨੂੰ = ਉਸਨੂੰ
:The first person plural ਅਸੀਂ + ਨੂੰ becomes ਸਾਨੂੰ because ਅਸਾਂ, a variant of ਅਸੀਂ is used to give ਅਸਾਨੂੰ from which ਅ drops to give ਸਾਨੂੰ. Thus
:* ਅਸੀਂ + ਨੂੰ ⇒ ਅਸਾਂ + ਨੂੰ = ਅਸਾਨੂੰ ⇒ ਸਾਨੂੰ
:In general when a suffix is added to ਅਸੀਂ it takes the form ਸਾ and this is true for all cases not just objective case.
:When ਤੁਸੀਂ combines with a suffix it becomes ਤੁਹਾ. Thus 
:* ਤੁਸੀਂ + ਨੂੰ = ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ
:But in the case of third person plural, ਨੂੰ is added as an independent postposition. Hence
:* ਉਹਨਾਂ + ਨੂੰ = ਉਹਨਾਂ ਨੂੰ

;'''Instrumental or agentative case derivations''' : The postposition '''ਤੋਂ''' (from) is added to pronouns to get the ਕਰਨ ਕਾਰਕ (instrumental or agentative case). When ਤੋਂ is added to ਮੈਂ it slightly changes its form to ਥੋਂ (remember ਥ is aspirated form of ਤ) and the result is ਮੈਥੋਂ. Thus
:* ਮੈਂ + ਤੋਂ = ਮੈਤੋਂ ⇒ ਮੈਥੋਂ
:But when added to one of ਅਸੀਂ, ਤੂੰ or ਤੁਸੀਂ, ਤੋਂ changes to ਥੋਂ and ਅਸੀਂ, ਤੂੰ and ਤੁਸੀਂ behave much the same way as in objective case. See for example
:* ਅਸੀਂ + ਤੋਂ ⇒ ਅਸਾਂ + ਤੋਂ = ਅਸਾਤੋਂ ⇒ ਸਾਤੋਂ⇒ ਸਾਥੋਂ
:* ਤੂੰ + ਤੋਂ ⇒ ਤੈ + ਤੋਂ = ਤੈਤੋਂ ⇒ ਤੈਥੋਂ
:* ਤੁਸੀਂ + ਤੋਂ = ਤੁਹਾਥੋਂ

;'''Dative case derivations''' : Recall that dative case is the recipient case of verb's outcome. Hence '''ਨੂੰ''' and '''ਲਈ''' postpositions are added to the base pronoun to derive the dative case. ਨੂੰ is added in the same way as in objective case but ਲਈ is simply added as a postposition.
:* ਅਧਿਆਪਕ ਨੇ '''ਮੈਨੂੰ''' ਸਬਕ ਪੜਾਇਆ 
:* ਅਧਿਆਪਕ ਨੇ '''ਮੇਰੇ ਲਈ''' ਸਬਕ ਦੁਰਹਾਇਆ.

;'''Ablative case derivations''' : A personal pronoun in ablative case is the one which relinquishes or gives away. The postposition '''ਤੋਂ''', '''ਕੋਲੋਂ''', '''ਲਾਗਿਉਂ''', '''ਉਤੋਂ''' and '''ਹੇਠੋਂ''' are added to derive the ablative case. For example 
:* ਅਧਿਆਪਕ ਨੇ ਮੈਥੋਂ ਕਿਤਾਬ ਲਈ 
:* ਅਧਿਆਪਕ ਨੇ ਮੇਰੇ ਕੋਲੋਂ ਕਿਤਾਬ ਲਈ 
:* ਅਧਿਆਪਕ ਨੇ ਮੇਰੇ ਲਾਗਿਉਂ ਕਿਤਾਬ ਚੁਕੀ 
:* ਮੇਰੇ ਉਤੋਂ ਸਾਰਾ ਕਰਜਾ ਉਤਰ ਗਿਆ 
:* ਮੇਰੇ ਹੇਠੋਂ ਚਾਦਰ ਚੁਕੀ ਗਈ

;'''Relational case derivations''' : The ਸੰਬੰਧ ਕਾਰਕ (relational case) of a personal pronoun is one which establishes a relation with some other noun or pronoun of the sentence. Hence '''ਦਾ''', '''ਦੇ''', '''ਦੀ''', '''ਦੀਆਂ''' and '''ਦਿਆਂ''' are added to the personal pronoun. 

:However in case of first person singular pronoun ਮੈਂ and second person singular pronoun ਤੂੰ  these ਦਾ, ਦੇ, ਦੀ, ਦੀਆਂ and ਦਿਆਂ get slightly distorted and become '''ਰਾ''', '''ਰੇ''', '''ਰੀ''', '''ਰੀਆਂ''' and '''ਰਿਆਂ''' as in '''ਮੇਰਾ''' ਘਰ ਖੂਬਸੂਰਤ ਹੈ or ਮੇਰੇ ਹੱਥ ਖਾਲੀ ਹਨ or ਮੇਰੀ ਪਤਨੀ ਖੂਬਸੂਰਤ ਹੈ or ਮੇਰੀਆਂ ਕਿਤਾਬਾਂ ਨਵੀਆਂ ਹਨ or ਮੇਰਿਆਂ ਦੇਸ਼ ਵਾਸੀਆਂ ਦੀ ਸ਼ਾਨ. Similarly for first person plural and second person plural these ਦਾ, ਦੇ, ਦੀ, ਦੀਆਂ and ਦਿਆਂ become '''ਡਾ''', '''ਡੇ''', '''ਡੀ''', '''ਡੀਆਂ''' and '''ਡਿਆਂ''' (see the table above).

:''A note worthy feature of these postpositions and suffixes is that they are gender aware, an exception to the general property of personal pronouns that they don't carry gender. Here also the form of relational personal pronoun reveals the gender of the noun or pronoun with which it establishes a link but the gender of the noun represented by the pronoun itself is not revealed''.

;'''Locative case derivations''' : The ਅਧਿਕਰਣ ਕਾਰਕ (locative case) reveals a placement or location of something somewhere. Thus postpositions '''ਉਤੇ''', '''ਵਿੱਚ''', '''ਕੋਲ''' and '''ਲਾਗੇ''' are used to obtain the locative case personal pronoun from the base personal pronoun e.g. '''ਮੇਰੇ ਉਤੇ''', '''ਮੇਰੇ ਵਿੱਚ''', '''ਮੇਰੇ ਕੋਲ''' and '''ਮੇਰੇ ਲਾਗੇ'''.

;'''Vocative case derivations''' : '''ਉਏ''', '''ਵੇ''' and '''ਨੀਂ''' are the three second person ਸੰਬੋਧਨ ਕਾਰਕ (vocative case) pronouns. '''ਉਏ''' is used for both second person singular as well as plural. '''ਵੇ''' is used by a female to address a male but '''ਨੀਂ''' is used by both males and females to address a female.

Here is a complete declension of the personal pronouns ਮੈਂ, ਤੂੰ and ਉਹ.

=== ਦੂਜੇ ਪੜਨਾਂਵ (Other pronouns) ===
Five other pronouns, described below, are also found in Punjabi.
#'''ਨਿਸਚੇ-ਵਾਚਕ ਪੜਨਾਂਵ (Demonstrative pronoun) :''' A demonstrative  pronoun is used for an object in sight and demonstrated with some gesture. There are five such demonstrative  pronouns, three used for things near the speaker/listener and two away from the speaker. These are '''ਆਹ''' (something near the speaker), '''ਹਾਹ''' (something near the listener), '''ਇਹ''' (something near both the speaker and the listener), '''ਔਹ''' (something away from the speaker but visible) and '''ਉਹ''' (something invisible). Let's see some examples in usage
##'''ਆਹ''' ਮੇਰੀ ਕਿਤਾਬ ਹੈ.
##'''ਹਾਹ''' ਤੇਰੀ ਕਿਤਾਬ ਹੈ.
##'''ਇਹ''' ਸਾਡਾ ਕਮਰਾ ਹੈ.
##'''ਔਹ''' ਉਹਨਾ ਦਾ ਘਰ ਹੈ.
##'''ਉਹ''' ਉਹਨਾ ਦੀ ਮੱਝ ਸੀ.
#'''ਅਨਿਸਚੇ-ਵਾਚਕ ਪੜਨਾਂਵ (Indefinite pronoun) :''' Indefinite pronouns are used when the object referred to is not definitely or completely specified by the pronoun. Some of the indefinite Punjabi pronouns are ਕੋਈ, ਕੁਝ, ਕਈ, ਸਭ, ਸਾਰੇ, ਵਿਰਲਾ, ਅਨੇਕ, ਬਹੁਤੇ, ਥੋੜੇ etc..Following are some examples of the indefinite pronouns in usage
##'''ਕੋਈ''' ਮਰ ਗਿਆ.
##'''ਕੁਝ''' ਨਾ ਬਚਿਆ.
##'''ਸਭ''' ਚਲੇ ਗਏ.
#'''ਸੰਬੰਧ-ਵਾਚਕ ਪੜਨਾਂਵ (Relative pronoun) :''' There are two pronouns (ਜਿਹੜਾ and ਜੋ) which establish relationship of the pronoun with another noun or pronoun used in another clauase of the sentence. Both of these pronouns viz. '''ਜਿਹੜਾ ''' and '''ਜੋ''' mean which and may be singular or plural. Let's see some examples
##'''ਜੋ''' ਆਇਆ ਉਹ ਚਲਾ ਗਿਆ.
##ਪੁਲਿਸ ਨੂੰ '''ਜਿਹੜਾ''' ਦਿਸਿਆ ਉਹਨਾ ਉਸਨੂੰ ਫੜ ਲਿਆ.
#'''ਪ੍ਰਸ਼ਨ-ਵਾਚਕ ਪੜਨਾਂਵ (Interrogative pronoun) :''' Some pronouns are used to enquire about the somebody/something represented by the noun of pronoun's reference. Such pronouns are called interrogative pronouns. See the following examples&lt;br&gt;
##ਦਰਵਾਜਾ '''ਕੌਣ''' ਖੜਕਾ ਗਿਆ ਹੈ?
##ਤੇਰਾ '''ਕਿਹੜਾ''' ਅਤੇ ਮੇਰਾ '''ਕਿਹੜਾ''' ਹੈ?
##'''ਕਿਸੇ''' ਨੇ ਕੀ ਕਰਨਾ ਹੈ?
#'''ਨਿੱਜ-ਵਾਚਕ ਪੜਨਾਂਵ (Reflexive pronoun) :''' The pronoun '''ਆਪ''' is used in conjunction with other pronouns. It refers to the self of the pronoun that combines with self. This pronoun reflects on the noun or pronoun it combines with and therefore is called reflexive pronoun. Here are some examples&lt;br&gt;
##ਮੈਂ '''ਆਪ''' ਉਸਨੂੰ ਦੇਖਿਆ.
##ਉਸਨੇ '''ਆਪ''' ਚੋਰ ਨੂੰ ਕੁਟਿਆ.
##ਤੁਸੀਂ '''ਆਪ''' ਕਿਉਂ ਨਹੀਂ ਗਏ.

== ਕਿਰਿਆ Verb ==
In this section we shall examine the verb as a part of speech, classification of verbs as Transitive and Intransitive verbs, the voice (active voice or passive voice) of the verb, the participles and the tense of the verb .&lt;br&gt;
;'''ਕਿਰਿਆ - Verb''' : It is the word or a group of words in a sentence that describes an action or a state with the time of happening of the action or time of the state. Like all other languages Punjabi verbs are also formed from the root verbs called ਧਾਤੂ. Let us examine this example&lt;br&gt;
:*ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਸਕੂਲ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ - Student goes to school.
:Here the group of words '''ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ''' (goes) describes the action of going. The word ਹੈ (=is) tells us that the action (go) continues in the present. '''ਜਾਂਦਾ''' thus is the base verb in this verb which is derived from the root ਜਾ.&lt;br&gt;
;'''ਸਕ੍ਰਮਕ ਕਿਰਿਆ - Transitive verb''' : In the above example while ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ (student) is the subject ਸਕੂਲ (school) is the object of the verb ਜਾਂਦਾ. If we write ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ it is not a complete sentence. Such verbs (ਕਿਰਿਆਵਾਂ) which must have an object (ਕਰਮ) are called ਸਕ੍ਰਮਕ ਕਿਰਿਆਵਾਂ. A Transitive verb may take more than one object in which case one object will be a principal object&lt;br&gt;
;'''ਅਕ੍ਰਮਕ ਕਿਰਿਆ - Intransitive verb''' : Let us now examine another example. ਯਾਤਰੀ ਮਰ ਗਿਆ - the traveller died. Here ਮਰ ਗਿਆ is the verb which it has no object (ਕਰਮ) but the sentence is still a complete sentence. Such a verb (ਕਿਰਿਆ) which need not have an object (ਕਰਮ) is called an ਅਕ੍ਰਮਕ ਕਿਰਿਆ (Intransitive verb). Many verbs act as Transitive verbs as well as intrastive verbs in different sentences.&lt;br&gt;
;'''ਕਰਤਰੀ ਵਾਚ - Active Voice''' : The voice of the verb has something to do with the grammatical constructionof the sentence. Where the doer of the verb's action acts as subject of the sentence the verb is said to in the active voice (ਕਰਤਰੀ ਵਾਚ). In the sentence ਉਸਨੇ ਫਲ ਖਾਧਾ (he ate the fruit) ਉਹ (he) does the action of the verb (eat) and is also the subject of the sentence and thus the verb is in active voice.
;'''ਕਰਮ ਵਾਚ - Passive Voice''' : Now look at the sentence ਫਲ ਉਸਦੇ ਦੁਆਰਾ ਖਾਧਾ ਗਿਆ (fruit was eaten by him). Here ਫਲ (fruit) is the object of the verb but in the sentence it acts as the subject. Thus ਖਾਧਾ ਗਿਆ is the passive voice of the verb.

== ਕਾਲ - Tense ==
Each verb has a tense or ਕਾਲ to show the time of happening of the action of the verb. There are three broad categories of ਕਾਲ or tense viz., ਵਰਤਮਾਨ ਕਾਲ - present tense signifying that the action of the verb happened or is happening in the present, ਭੂਤਕਾਲ - past tense signifying that the action of the verb happened or was happening in the past and ਭਵਿਖ ਕਾਲ - future tense signifying that the action will happen or would have happened in future. Each of these tenses are sub-divided into divisions showing the state of the action as to its continuing, having been completed etc. We discuss each of these classifications below. 

=== ਵਰਤਮਾਨ ਕਾਲ - present tense ===
The present tense has six categories viz.,
#ਵਰਤਮਾਨ ਅਨਿਸਚਿਤ ਕਾਲ - present indefinite tense : In the following example ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ (student) is the subject, ਸਕੂਲ (school) is the object and ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ(goes) is the verb. 
#*ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਸਕੂਲ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ - Student goes to school.&lt;br&gt;Please note that ਜਾਂਦਾ is the present participle form of the root verb ਜਾ and ਹੈ is the present tense discriminant added to the present participle. Also note that the object ਸਕੂਲ precedes the verb ਜਾਂਦਾ but follows the subject ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ. ''The present indefinite tense is used to describe an action undertaken by the subject repetitively''.
#ਵਰਤਮਾਨ ਚਾਲੂ ਕਾਲ - present continuous tense : Here ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ is the subject, ਸਕੂਲ the object and ਜਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ (is going) is the verb.
#*ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਸਕੂਲ ਜਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ - Student is going to school.&lt;br&gt;Please note that ਜਾ ਰਿਹਾ is equivalent to english gerund going of the verb ਜਾ and ਹੈ is the present tense discriminant. The verb ਜਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ indicates that the action of the verb is still incomplete and is continuing.
#ਵਰਤਮਾਨ ਪੂਰਨ ਕਾਲ - present perfect tense:
#*ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਸਕੂਲ ਗਿਆ ਹੈ - Student has gone to school.&lt;br&gt;Here ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ is the subject, ਸਕੂਲ the object and ਗਿਆ ਹੈ (has gone) is the verb. Please note that ਗਿਆ ਹੈ is composed of past participle of root verb ਜਾ and ਹੈ is the present tense discriminant. The verb ਗਿਆ ਹੈ indicates that the action of the verb has been completed presently but not in distant past.
#ਵਰਤਮਾਨ ਪੂਰਨ ਚਾਲੂ ਕਾਲ - present perfect continuous tense:
#*ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਸਕੂਲ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ - Student has been going to school.&lt;br&gt;Here ਜਾਂਦਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ (has been going) is the verb. Please note that ਜਾਂਦਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ is composed of present participle of root verb ਜਾ, ਰਿਹਾ the continuous tense discriminant and ਹੈ the present tense discriminant. The verb ਜਾਂਦਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ indicates that the action of the verb was started in the past but continued till the reference point being talked about.
#ਵਰਤਮਾਨ ਸ਼ਰਤੀ ਕਾਲ - conditional present tense:
#*ਜੇ ਅਧਿਆਪਕ ਕਹੇ ਤਾਂ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਸਕੂਲ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ - If teacher asks student goes to school.&lt;br&gt;Here ਕਹੇ is the conditional present tense verb.
#ਵਰਤਮਾਨ ਹੁਕਮੀ ਕਾਲ - present directive tense:
#*ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀਓ ਸਕੂਲ ਜਾਓ - Students! go to school.&lt;br&gt;Here ਜਾਓ is the present directive tense verb.

=== ਭੂਤਕਾਲ - past tense ===
The past tense has the following five categories viz.,
#ਅਨਿਸਚਿਤ ਭੂਤਕਾਲ - past indefinite tense:
#*ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਸਕੂਲ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਸੀ - Student used to go to school.&lt;br&gt;Please note that ਜਾਂਦਾ is the present participle form of the root verb ਜਾ and ਸੀ is the past tense discriminant added to the present participle. ''The past indefinite tense is used to describe an action undertaken by the subject repetitively''.
#ਚਾਲੂ ਭੂਤਕਾਲ - past continuous tense:
#*ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਸਕੂਲ ਜਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ - Student was going to school. Here ਜਾਂਦਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ  (had been going) is the verb. Please note that ਜਾਂਦਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ is composed of present participle of root verb ਜਾ, ਰਿਹਾ the continuous tense discriminant and ਸੀ the past tense discriminant. The verb ਜਾਂਦਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ indicates that the action of the verb was started in the past but continued till the reference point being talked about.
#ਪੂਰਨ ਭੂਤਕਾਲ - past perfect tense:
#*ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਸਕੂਲ ਗਿਆ ਸੀ - Student had gone to school. &lt;br&gt;Here ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ is the subject, ਸਕੂਲ the object and ਗਿਆ ਸੀ (had gone) is the verb. Please note that ਗਿਆ ਸੀ is composed of past participle of root verb ਜਾ and ਸੀ is the past tense discriminant. The verb ਗਿਆ ਸੀ indicates that the action of the verb has been completed in the past.
#ਪੂਰਨ ਚਾਲੂ ਭੂਤਕਾਲ - past perfect continuous tense:
#*ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਸਕੂਲ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ - Student had been going to school.&lt;br&gt;Here ਜਾਂਦਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ (had been going) is the verb. Please note that ਜਾਂਦਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ is composed of present participle of root verb ਜਾ, ਰਿਹਾ the continuous tense discriminant and ਸੀ the past tense discriminant. The verb ਜਾਂਦਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਸੀ indicates that the action of the verb was started in the past but continued till the reference point being talked about.
#ਸ਼ਰਤੀ ਭੂਤਕਾਲ - conditional past tense:
#*ਜੇ ਅਧਿਆਪਕ ਕਹਿੰਦਾ ਸੀ ਤਾਂ ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਸਕੂਲ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਸੀ - If teacher asked student went to school.&lt;br&gt;Here ਕਹਿੰਦਾ is the conditional past tense verb.
=== ਭਵਿਖ ਕਾਲ - future tense ===
The future tense has the following four categories viz., 
#ਅਨਿਸਚਿਤ ਭਵਿਖ ਕਾਲ - future indefinite tense:
#*ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਸਕੂਲ ਜਾਵੇਗਾ - Student will go to school.&lt;br&gt;Please note the special derivative ਜਾਵੇਗਾ of the root verb ਜਾ which acts as future tense  discriminant.
#ਚਾਲੂ ਭਵਿਖ ਕਾਲ - future continuous tense:
#*ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਸਕੂਲ ਜਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੋਵੇਗਾ - Student will be going to school.&lt;br&gt;Please note the use of both ਰਿਹਾ indicative of coninuous tense and ਹੋਵੇਗਾ of the  future tense.
#ਪੂਰਨ ਭਵਿਖ ਕਾਲ - future perfect tense:
#*ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਸਕੂਲ ਗਿਆ ਹੋਵੇਗਾ - Student will have gone to school. 
#ਪੂਰਨ ਚਾਲੂ ਭਵਿਖ ਕਾਲ - future perfect continuous tense:
#*ਵਿਦਿਆਰਥੀ ਸਕੂਲ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੋਵੇਗਾ - Student will have been going to school.

A little help?  Anybody have the corresponding information (or a link) in regards to light trucks?[[Special:Contributions/173.8.220.209|173.8.220.209]] ([[User talk:173.8.220.209|talk]]) 21:47, 19 April 2010 (UTC)

Hey, I appreciate the additional info that was noted re engine codes (I came here because my 97 Lumina needs an engine); however, why don't you (the contributor of that info) just ''update the table?''  I was initially confused, thinking you were referring to errors in the VIN structure itself, or in GM's use of it. (Um, you're not, right?)

I just purchased a new engine in the crate.  The number is GM 4306.  What vehicles was this engine put in?

== gear ratio ==

How, for a novice girl in mechanic I can figure out the gear ratio from a vin number? I have a '94 Suburban and the rear end gave up on me, I am trying to find one from a vehicule that have this vin number: 2GNEG25HXL4126103. My baby have a 3:92 ratio according to some islander mechanic.

== Unable to find engine code ==

I am looking at a used 2008 GMC Yukon Denali with VIN (8th digit) engine code = 8.  This site does not identify this engine code.  I have not physically looked at the vehicle, but wanted to identify the engine before I made the trip.  I'm looking for a Yukon with the Vortec 6000, which in 2008 I believe was a LY6 engine, but have been unable to ascertain from the VIN number what engine this vehicle has.  It would be helpful if this site was complete and included all the code that were used on various GM vehicles.

Very Confusing, maybe change the layout.</text>

== Author ==

I, '''Jaspal Singh''', initiated this Wikibook for the benefit of those non-natives who want to learn this fascinating language. I am a member of the '''Indian Administrative Service''' and am presently serving '''Punjab (India) Government''' in the Higher Education and Languages department. This project is amateur in nature and has no connection with my employer or employment.

As of 2008, I am 47 and I live in Chandigarh. I enjoy a number of interests including software development. '''Gains''' a General Accounting and Inventory Management System and '''CMIS''' the College Management Information System are two of my popular works.

I seek your help and contribution to complete and improve the book, so it can better serve the 
cause of Punjabi. You can see my user page [[User:jaspalkaler|Jaspal Singh]] or put a comment 
on my [[User talk:jaspalkaler|talk]] page. You can also reach me at jaspalkaler@gmail.com.

== Acknowledgements ==

This Wikibook is based on the knowledge gained from various sources including, but not limited to, the teachers who taught me at different times. References were also made to a large number of works on the subject. I remain indebted to my teachers and such authors (Dr. Harkirat Singh of Punjabi University deserves a special mention here) whose works were referred to at different stages of development of this Wikibook. No originality is claimed.

== Contributions Acknowledged ==

Generous help came from wikibookians Judith - [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] ([[User talk:Junesun|talk]]) 
and [[User:YoshiroShin|YoshiroShin]] ([[User talk:YoshiroShin|talk]]). Based on the suggestions made by 
Judith - [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] ([[User talk:Junesun|talk]]) I have completely reworked the 
Gurmukhi script module of this wikibook introducing letters one by one and using examples 
that are familiar to English knowing readers. 
[[User:YoshiroShin|YoshiroShin]] ([[User talk:YoshiroShin|talk]]) recommended that 
we should have Shahmukhi script as separate module of this book so that it is easier to 
search for Punjabi by just typing Punjabi in the search box. 
He himself is writing Shahmukhi lessons. 
Help received from Judith - [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] ([[User talk:Junesun|talk]]) 
and [[User:YoshiroShin|YoshiroShin]] ([[User talk:YoshiroShin|talk]]) as well as 
readers is greatly valued and gratefully acknowledged.

      <comment>/* Typo in fix definition */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Wider Theory}}

The &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; function is a particularly weird-looking function when you first see it. However, it is useful for one main theoretical reason: introducing it into the (typed) lambda calculus as a primitive allows you to define recursive functions.

== Introducing &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; ==
Let's have the definition of &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; before we go any further:

 fix :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a
 fix f = let x = f x in f

This immediately seems quite magical. Surely &lt;code&gt;fix f&lt;/code&gt; will yield an infinite application stream of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;s: &lt;code&gt;f (f (f (... )))&lt;/code&gt;? The resolution to this is our good friend, ''lazy evaluation''. Essentially, this sequence of applications of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; will converge to a value if (and only if) &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is a lazy function. Let's see some examples:

{{HaskellExample|&lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; examples|
 Prelude&gt; :m Control.Monad.Fix
 Prelude Control.Monad.Fix&gt; fix (2+)
 *** Exception: stack overflow
 Prelude Control.Monad.Fix&gt; fix (const &quot;hello&quot;)
 &quot;hello&quot;
 Prelude Control.Monad.Fix&gt; fix (1:)
 [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,...
}}

We first import the &lt;code&gt;Control.Monad.Fix&lt;/code&gt; module to bring &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; into scope (this is also available in the &lt;code&gt;Data.Function&lt;/code&gt;). Then we try some examples. Since the definition of &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; is so simple, let's expand our examples to explain what happens:

   fix (2+)
 = 2 + (fix (2+))
 = 2 + (2 + fix (2+))
 = 4 + (fix (2+))
 = 4 + (2 + fix (2+))
 = 6 + fix (2+)
 = ...

It's clear that this will never converge to any value. Let's expand the next example:

   fix (const &quot;hello&quot;)
 = const &quot;hello&quot; (fix (const &quot;hello&quot;))
 = &quot;hello&quot;

This is quite different: we can see after one expansion of the definition of &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; that because &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; ignores its second argument, the evaluation concludes. The evaluation for the last example is a little different, but we can proceed similarly:

   fix (1:)
 = 1 : fix (1:)
 = 1 : (1 : fix (1:))
 = 1 : (1 : (1 : fix (1:)))

Although this similarly looks like it'll never converge to a value, keep in mind that when you type &lt;code&gt;fix (1:)&lt;/code&gt; into GHCi, what it's really doing is applying &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; to that. So we should look at how &lt;code&gt;show (fix (1:))&lt;/code&gt; evaluates (for simplicity, we'll pretend &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; on lists doesn't put commas between items):

   show (fix (1:))
 = &quot;[&quot; ++ map show (fix (1:)) ++ &quot;]&quot;
 = &quot;[&quot; ++ map show (1 : fix (1:)) ++ &quot;]&quot;
 = &quot;[&quot; ++ &quot;1&quot; ++ map show (fix (1:)) ++ &quot;]&quot;
 = &quot;[&quot; ++ &quot;1&quot; ++ &quot;1&quot; ++ map show (fix (1:)) ++ &quot;]&quot;

So although the &lt;code&gt;map show (fix (1:))&lt;/code&gt; will never terminate, it does produce output: GHCi can print the beginning of the string, &lt;code&gt;&quot;[&quot; ++ &quot;1&quot; ++ &quot;1&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, and continue to print more as &lt;code&gt;map show (fix (1:))&lt;/code&gt; produces more. This is lazy evaluation at work: the printing function doesn't need to consume its entire input string before beginning to print, it does so as soon as it can start.

{{Exercises|
What, if anything, will the following expressions converge to?
* &lt;code&gt;fix (&quot;hello&quot;++)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;fix (\x -&gt; cycle (1:x))&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;fix reverse&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;fix id&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;fix (\x -&gt; take 2 $ cycle (1:x))&lt;/code&gt;
}}

== &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; and fixed points ==
A ''fixed point'' of a function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is a value &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; such that &lt;code&gt;f a == a&lt;/code&gt;. For example, &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; is a fixed point of the function &lt;code&gt;(* 3)&lt;/code&gt; since &lt;code&gt;0 * 3 == 0&lt;/code&gt;. This is where the name of &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; comes from: it finds the ''least-defined fixed point'' of a function. (We'll come to what &quot;least defined&quot; means in a minute.) Notice that for both of our examples above that converge, this is readily seen:

 const &quot;hello&quot; &quot;hello&quot; -&gt; &quot;hello&quot;
 (1:) [1,1,..]         -&gt; [1,1,...]

And since there's no number &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; such that &lt;code&gt;2+x == x&lt;/code&gt;, it also makes sense that &lt;code&gt;fix (2+)&lt;/code&gt; diverges.

{{Exercises|
For each of the functions &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; in the above exercises for which you decided that &lt;code&gt;fix f&lt;/code&gt; converges, verify that &lt;code&gt;fix f&lt;/code&gt; finds a fixed point.}}

In fact, it's obvious from the definition of &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; that it finds a fixed point. All we need to do is write the equation for &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; the other way around:

 f (fix f) = fix f

Which is precisely the definition of a fixed point! So it seems that &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; should always find a fixed point. But sometimes &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; seems to fail at this, as sometimes it diverges. We can repair this property, however, if we bring in some [[Haskell/Denotational semantics|denotational semantics]]. Every Haskell type actually includes a special value called bottom, written &lt;code&gt;⊥&lt;/code&gt;. So the values with type, for example, &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; include, in fact, &lt;code&gt;⊥&lt;/code&gt; as well as &lt;code&gt;1, 2, 3&lt;/code&gt; etc.. Divergent computations are denoted by a value of &lt;code&gt;⊥&lt;/code&gt;, i.e., we have that &lt;code&gt;fix (2+) = ⊥&lt;/code&gt;.

The special value &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; is also denoted by this &lt;code&gt;⊥&lt;/code&gt;. Now we can understand how &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; finds fixed points of functions like &lt;code&gt;(2+)&lt;/code&gt;:

{{HaskellExample|Fixed points of &lt;code&gt;(2+)&lt;/code&gt;|2=
&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; (2+) undefined
*** Exception: Prelude.undefined
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

So feeding &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; (i.e., &lt;code&gt;⊥&lt;/code&gt;) to &lt;code&gt;(2+)&lt;/code&gt; gives us &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; back. So &lt;code&gt;⊥&lt;/code&gt; is a fixed point of &lt;code&gt;(2+)&lt;/code&gt;!

In the case of &lt;code&gt;(2+)&lt;/code&gt;, it is the only fixed point. However, there are other functions &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; with several fixed points for which &lt;code&gt;fix f&lt;/code&gt; still diverges: &lt;code&gt;fix (*3)&lt;/code&gt; diverges, but we remarked above that &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; is a fixed point of that function. This is where the &quot;least-defined&quot; clause comes in. Types in Haskell have a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_order partial order] on them called ''definedness''. In any type, &lt;code&gt;⊥&lt;/code&gt; is the least-defined value (hence the name &quot;bottom&quot;). For simple types like &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;, the only pairs in the partial order are &lt;code&gt;⊥ ≤ 1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;⊥ ≤ 2&lt;/code&gt; and so on. We do not have &lt;code&gt;m ≤ n&lt;/code&gt; for any non-bottom &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;s &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;. Similar comments apply to other simple types like &lt;code&gt;Bool&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;. For &quot;layered&quot; values such as lists or &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;, the picture is more complicated, and we refer to the chapter on [[Haskell/Denotational semantics|denotational semantics]].

So since &lt;code&gt;⊥&lt;/code&gt; is the least-defined value for all types and &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; finds the least-defined fixed point, if &lt;code&gt;f ⊥ = ⊥&lt;/code&gt;, we will have &lt;code&gt;fix f = ⊥&lt;/code&gt; (and the converse is also true). If you've read the denotational semantics article, you will recognise this as the criterion for a ''strict function'': &lt;code&gt;fix f&lt;/code&gt; diverges if and only if &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is strict.

== Recursion ==
If you've come across examples of &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; on the internet, or on the [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/IRC_channel #haskell IRC channel], the chances are that you've seen examples involving &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; and recursion. Here's a classic example:

{{HaskellExample|Encoding recursion with &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt;|2=
&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; let fact n = if n == 0 then 1 else n * fact (n-1) in fact 5
120
Prelude&gt; fix (\rec n -&gt; if n == 0 then 1 else n * rec (n-1)) 5
120
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

Here we have used &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; to &quot;encode&quot; the factorial function: note that (if we regard &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; as a language primitive) our second definition of &lt;code&gt;fact&lt;/code&gt; doesn't involve recursion at all. In a language like the typed lambda calculus that doesn't feature recursion, we can introduce &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; in to write recursive functions in this way. Here are some more examples:

{{HaskellExample|More &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; examples|2=
&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; fix (\rec f l -&gt; if null l then [] else f (head l) : rec f (tail l)) (+1) [1..3]
[2,3,4]
Prelude&gt; map (fix (\rec n -&gt; if n == 1 || n == 2 then 1 else rec (n-1) + rec (n-2))) [1..10]
[1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55]
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

So how does this work? Let's first approach it from a denotational point of view with our &lt;code&gt;fact&lt;/code&gt; function. For brevity let's define:

 fact' rec n = if n == 0 then 1 else n * rec (n-1)

So that we're computing &lt;code&gt;fix fact' 5&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; will find a fixed point of &lt;code&gt;fact'&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. the ''function'' &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; such that &lt;code&gt;f == fact' f&lt;/code&gt;. But let's expand what this means:

 f = fact' f
   = \n -&gt; if n == 0 then 1 else n * f (n-1)

All we did was substitute &lt;code&gt;rec&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; in the definition of &lt;code&gt;fact'&lt;/code&gt;. But this looks exactly like a ''recursive'' definition of a factorial function! &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; feeds &lt;code&gt;fact'&lt;/code&gt; ''itself'' as its first parameter in order to create a recursive function out of a higher-order function.

We can also consider things from a more operational point of view. Let's actually expand the definition of &lt;code&gt;fix fact'&lt;/code&gt;:

   fix fact'
 = fact' (fix fact')
 = (\rec n -&gt; if n == 0 then 1 else n * rec (n-1)) (fix fact')
 = \n -&gt; if n == 0 then 1 else n * fix fact' (n-1)
 = \n -&gt; if n == 0 then 1 else n * fact' (fix fact') (n-1)
 = \n -&gt; if n == 0 then 1
         else n * (\rec n' -&gt; if n' == 0 then 1 else n' * rec (n'-1)) (fix fact') (n-1)
 = \n -&gt; if n == 0 then 1
         else n * (if n-1 == 0 then 1 else (n-1) * fix fact' (n-2))
 = \n -&gt; if n == 0 then 1
         else n * (if n-1 == 0 then 1
                   else (n-1) * (if n-2 == 0 then 1
                                 else (n-2) * fix fact' (n-3)))
 = ...

Notice that the use of &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; allows us to keep &quot;unravelling&quot; the definition of &lt;code&gt;fact'&lt;/code&gt;: every time we hit the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; clause, we product another copy of &lt;code&gt;fact'&lt;/code&gt; via the evaluation rule &lt;code&gt;fix fact' = fact' (fix fact')&lt;/code&gt;, which functions as the next call in the recursion chain. Eventually we hit the &lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt; clause and bottom out of this chain.

{{Exercises|
# Expand the other two examples we gave above in this sense. You may need a lot of paper for the Fibonacci example!
# Write non-recursive versions of &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt;.
}}

== The typed lambda calculus ==
In this section we'll expand upon a point mentioned a few times in the previous section: how &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; allows us to encode recursion in the typed lambda calculus. It presumes you've already met the typed lambda calculus. Recall that in the lambda calculus, there is no &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; clause or top-level bindings. Every program is a simple tree of lambda abstractions, applications and literals. Let's say we want to write a &lt;code&gt;fact&lt;/code&gt; function. Assuming we have a type called &lt;code&gt;Nat&lt;/code&gt; for the natural numbers, we'd start out something like the following:

 λn:Nat. if iszero n then 1 else n * &lt;blank&gt; (n-1)

The problem is, how do we fill in the &lt;code&gt;&lt;blank&gt;&lt;/code&gt;? We don't have a name for our function, so we can't call it recursively. The only way to bind names to terms is to use a lambda abstraction, so let's give that a go:

 (λf:Nat→Nat. λn:Nat. if iszero n then 1 else n * f (n-1))
   (λm:Nat. if iszero m then 1 else m * &lt;blank&gt; (m-1))

This expands to:

 λn:Nat. if iszero n then 1
         else n * (if iszero n-1 then 1 else (n-1) * &lt;blank&gt; (n-2))

We still have a &lt;code&gt;&lt;blank&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. We could try to add one more layer in:
   
 (λf:Nat→Nat. λn:Nat. if iszero n then 1 else n * f (n-1)
   ((λg:Nat→Nat. λm:Nat. if iszero n' then 1 else n' * g (m-1))
     (λp:Nat. if iszero p then 1 else p * &lt;blank&gt; (p-1))))
 
 -&gt;
 
 λn:Nat. if iszero n then 1
         else n * (if iszero n-1 then 1
                   else (n-1) * (if iszero n-2 then 1 else (n-2) * &lt;blank&gt; (n-3)))

It's pretty clear we're never going to be able to get rid of this &lt;code&gt;&lt;blank&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, no matter how many levels of naming we add in. Never, that is, unless we use &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt;, which, in essence, provides an object from which we can always unravel one more layer of recursion and still have what we started off:

 fix (λf:Nat→Nat. λn:Nat. if iszero n then 1 else n * f (n-1))

This is a perfect factorial function in the typed lambda calculus plus &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; is actually slightly more interesting than that in the context of the typed lambda calculus: if we introduce it into the language, then every type becomes inhabited, because given some concrete type &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;, the following expression has type &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;:

 fix (λx:T. x)

This, in Haskell-speak, is &lt;code&gt;fix id&lt;/code&gt;, which is denotationally &lt;code&gt;⊥&lt;/code&gt;. So we see that as soon as we introduce &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; to the typed lambda calculus, the property that every well-typed term reduces to a value is lost.

== Fix as a data type ==
It is also possible to make a fix data type in Haskell.

There are three ways of defining it.
 newtype Fix f=Fix (f (Fix f))

or using the RankNTypes extension
 newtype Mu f=Mu (forall a.(f a-&gt;a)-&gt;a)
 data Nu f=forall a.Nu a (a-&gt;f a)

Mu and Nu help generalize folds, unfolds and refolds.
 fold :: (f a -&gt; a) -&gt; Mu f -&gt; a
 fold g (Mu f)=f g
 unfold :: (a -&gt; f a) -&gt; a -&gt; Nu f
 unfold f x=Nu x f
 refold :: (a -&gt; f a) -&gt; (g a-&gt; a) -&gt; Mu f -&gt; Nu g
 refold f g=unfold g . fold f

Mu and Nu are restricted versions of Fix.
Mu is used for making inductive noninfinite data and Nu is used for making coinductive infinite data.
Eg)
 newpoint Stream a=Stream (Nu ((,) a)) -- forsome b. (b,b-&gt;(a,b))
 newpoint Void a=Void (Mu ((,) a)) -- forall b.((a,b)-&gt;b)-&gt;b

Unlike the fix point function the fix point types do not lead to bottom.
In the following code Bot is perfectly defined. It is equivalent to the unit type ().
 newtype Id a=Id a
 newtype Bot=Bot (Fix Id) -- equals          newtype Bot=Bot Bot
 -- There is only one allowable term. Bot $ Bot $ Bot $ Bot ..,

The Fix data type cannot model all forms of recursion.
Take for instance this nonregular data type.
 data Node a=Two a a|Three a a a
 data FingerTree a=U a|Up (FingerTree (Node a))
It is not easy to implement this using Fix.

Suppose we have a parametric curve in three dimensions, &lt;math&gt;f(t)=(x_1(t),x_2(t),x_3(t))&lt;/math&gt;. Of course, it would be required that all three functions be continuous. This essentially defines a curve, since it is a continuous image of the real numbers onto the real 3-space.

Now, we can define the arc length of this curve over an interval. Say the interval is [a,b]. Now divide [a,b] into partitions, &lt;math&gt;a=a_0&lt;a_1&lt;a_2&lt;a_3&lt;...&lt;a_n=b&lt;/math&gt;, and call this partition P. Take the sum of the distances &lt;math&gt;|f(a_n)-f(a_{n-1})|&lt;/math&gt;, to get &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^3 (x_j(a_i)-x_j(a_{i-1}))^2}&lt;/math&gt;, and call this sum L(P). Now, take the supremum of the lengths, &lt;math&gt;\sup\{L(P)\in R|P&lt;/math&gt; is a partition&lt;math&gt;\}&lt;/math&gt;. If this number is finite, we call it a '''rectifiable curve.'''

Now we establish a sufficient and necessary condition for a curve in 3-space to be rectifiable (note: this can easily be extended to an n-space through an analogous argument).

'''Theorem:'''&lt;br /&gt;A continuous curve in three dimensions is rectifiable if and only if all of its component functions are functions of bounded variation.&lt;br /&gt;'''Proof:'''&lt;br /&gt;

'''Theorem:'''&lt;br /&gt;If a curve f(x) in 3-space is continuously differentiable in all 3 components, then it is rectifiable and the length from f(a) to f(b) is &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b |f'(x)| dx&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;'''Proof:'''&lt;br /&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Given X1, X2, ... an infinite sequence of i.i.d. random variables with finite expected value E(X1) = E(X2) = ... = µ &lt; ∞, we are interested in the convergence of the sample average

&lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_n=\tfrac1n(X_1+\cdots+X_n). &lt;/math&gt; 

==The weak law==

Theorem: &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_n \, \xrightarrow{P} \, \mu \qquad\textrm{for}\qquad n \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Proof:


This proof uses the assumption of finite variance &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var} (X_i)=\sigma^2 &lt;/math&gt; (for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;). The independence of the random variables implies no correlation between them, and we have that

&lt;math&gt; 
\operatorname{Var}(\overline{X}_n) = \frac{n\sigma^2}{n^2} = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}. &lt;/math&gt;

The common mean μ of the sequence is the mean of the sample average:

&lt;math&gt; 
E(\overline{X}_n) = \mu. &lt;/math&gt;

Using Chebyshev's inequality on &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_n &lt;/math&gt; results in

&lt;math&gt; 
\operatorname{P}( \left| \overline{X}_n-\mu \right| \geq \varepsilon) \leq \frac{\sigma^2}{n\varepsilon^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

This may be used to obtain the following:

&lt;math&gt; 
\operatorname{P}( \left| \overline{X}_n-\mu \right| &lt; \varepsilon) = 1 - \operatorname{P}( \left| \overline{X}_n-\mu \right| \geq \varepsilon) \geq 1 - \frac{\sigma^2}{n \varepsilon^2 }. &lt;/math&gt;

As n approaches infinity, the expression approaches 1. And by definition of convergence in probability (see [[wikipedia:Convergence of random variables|Convergence of random variables]]), we have obtained

&lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_n \, \xrightarrow{P} \, \mu \qquad\textrm{for}\qquad n \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Ordering of lists ===
Should the vocabulary lists be alphabetized or otherwise ordered?

== Templates for table? ==
:'''Summary: A proposal to use two or three templates to display a table so that we can easily change the order of words of a row (the order of Kanji, Kana, Romaji, and English).'''

I found the appearance of the tables on [[Japanese:Vocabulary Animals|Animals]] seems good and I'd like to use this. However, I noticed that there're several ways of ordering(in a row). In  [[Japanese:Vocabulary Animals|Animals]], the order is &quot;Kanji - Kana - Romaji - English&quot; but in other pages, other orders...

Thus, I propose to use templates like [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Tree of Life/Cultivar infobox|the one here]](or [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Tree of Life/taxobox usage|here]]). 
*Pros: By applying the template first, changing of the order is quite easy. You don't have to edit all of the Vocab pages again, instead, all you need to do is just edit a few templates. '''The changes might occur more than once'''. If you don't use template, you've got to edit all of the pages every time you change the order.
**Additionaly, you can easily change the appearance of all the table at once by editing the CSS code on a template. Or, even the format can be changed. When you'd like to say good-bye to table format, you can use list format or text-style format (For example, list format can be achieved by using pipe character (|) as: * Kanji | Kana | Romaji | English)
*Cons: You've got to apply template formnat for each table. Some might hate this task. Template is a bit complicated than table (but not much. Please see the followings what it's like). If it's certain that the change would never occur, applying the templates is worthless tasks.

===How to use===
Write and fill followings on the page:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Template:Japanese vocab header}}
{{Template:Japanese vocab|
|Kanji= 
|Kana= 
|Romaji= 
|English= 
}}
{{Template:Japanese vocab|
|Kanji= 
|Kana= 
|Romaji= 
|English= 
}}
...
(repeat &quot;Template:Japanese vocab&quot;)
...
{{Template:Japanese vocab footer}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The order of the parameters is not important. It's arbitrary. I mean, you can also use

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Template:Japanese vocab|
|English= 
|Romaji= 
|Kana= 
|Kanji= 
}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

or whatever you like. The order of parameters here do not affect the real order anyway. When you would like to change the order, edit the templates instead. Once apply the template format to a page, just leave it.

;Sample
:A sample is available: [[User:Marsian/Vocabulary Aviation]]

===Templates===
I think just two or three templates are needed. Each of them is a part of wiki-style table. The following examples are in the case when we chose to use the order &quot;Kanji - Kana - Romaji - English&quot;. 

{{[[Template:Japanese vocab header]]}} (temporary name) is:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{|
|- style=&quot;background-color:#ccccff&quot;
! [[Japanese:Kanji|Kanji]]
! [[Japanese:Kana|Kana]]
! [[Japanese:Romaji|R&amp;#333;maji]]
! English
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

{{[[Template:Japanese vocab]]}} (temporary name) is:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|-
| {{{Kanji}}}
| {{{Kana}}}
| {{{Romaji}}}
| {{{English}}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

{{[[Template:Japanese vocab footer]]}} (temporary name) is:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

;Note
:One might think that this third template is useless and simply put &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;|} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; directly to the page is enough. Perhaps it's correct. Because there's little possibility to convert the table into list or text-style format (if there's a possiblity and when conversion is neede, edit the footer template and replace &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;|} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; with &amp;amp;nbsp; (space)). 

;Sample
:Samples are available:
:*[[User:Marsian/Japanese vocab header]]
:*[[User:Marsian/Japanese vocab]]
:*[[User:Marsian/Japanese vocab footer]]

====How to change the order?====
When you need to change the order, edit these templates. For instance, to get the &quot;English - Romaji - Kana - Kanji&quot; order, just rearrange the templates as:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{|
|- style=&quot;background:#ccccff&quot;
! English
! [[Japanese:Romaji|R&amp;#333;maji]]
! [[Japanese:Kana|Kana]]
! [[Japanese:Kanji|Kanji]]
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

and

 &lt;nowiki&gt;|-
| {{{English}}}
| {{{Romaji}}}
| {{{Kana}}}
| {{{Kanji}}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

That's all. Remember, when you don't use templates, what you have to do is... yes, edit all the vocab pages to rearrange all the row or the tables... ''I'' do not like to do it.

;Sample
:Try editing [[User:Marsian/Japanese vocab header|header sample]] and [[User:Marsian/Japanese vocab|item sample]] and see what happens to [[User:Marsian/Vocabulary Aviation|sample page]].

===Comments===
What should be done now?
#To decide whether we use the templates or not.
#If use, to name the templates.
#If use, decide the temporary order of a row.

Again, samples are here: [[User:Marsian/Japanese vocab header|header]] - [[User:Marsian/Japanese vocab|item]] - [[User:Marsian/Japanese vocab footer|footer]] - [[User:Marsian/Vocabulary Aviation|example]].

Probably the point is [[#How to use]]. Personally, I do not feel this format is not so complicated. Rather, I felt which parameter to put is quite clear (say, where &quot;Kanji= &quot; ...okay, I'll put 航空 and where &quot;Kana= &quot; ...okay, I'll put こうくう, and so on).

I wouldn't push this idea anymore if it's certain that the change would never occur again in the future... but can that be?

Of cource, if it's decided to use the templates, I'll do the task to create the templates(just move the samples) and apply them to the pages now exist(this will take some time). - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 16:09:49, 2005-08-29 (UTC)

:I think templates would be a good idea. You should go ahead and do it if you are up to it :). One thing I would suggest is that English word wikilinks should take you to wiktionary, not to wikipedia. Also, it would be nice if the kanji (or kana where kanji is not available) could also link to the English wikibook in addition to the Japanese wikibook. I'm not sure if there are any naming conventions for templates, but something like Wikipedia:Template messages, Japanese:Vocabulary:Entry and Japanese:Vocabulary:Footer would probably be ideal. 

:As for being &quot;certain that the change would never occur again in the future&quot;, you just never know for sure :). Also, you never know for sure what other kind of tweaks we might need to make to the pages.&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:207.195.35.2|207.195.35.2]] 00:58, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

:::Thanks for your comments. All right, I'll fix the links to wikt:. But I don't understand for kanji or kana matter, what do you mean? I let them link to ja.wikipedia at the moment. You meant en.wikipedia?  About the name, though I couldn't find colons are used for templates, well, I'll try it anyway. - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 09:01:48, 2005-08-31 (UTC)

== Slash convention ==

Several subpages of [[Japanese/Vocabulary]] are at [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion|Votes for deletion]]. The problem is that [[Special:Contributions/65.43.156.166|63.43.156.166]] copied the pages instead of moving them.

I am reverting this module to link to the old pages. When the copies are deleted and the pages are moved, please undo my revert. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:32, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

Unlike with some wikis, at Wikibooks it is best to move the pages before changing the links. Wikibooks &quot;move&quot; feature leaves a redirect so old links still work. Also, you need a Wikibooks user account for the &quot;move&quot; feature. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:37, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

=== other ===
*[[:Image:Fixed assgnment access.gif]] &amp;mdash; probably best to split this up into 3 images.  Maybe the 2 on the left can be SVG.  The label for each one should be pulled out into the module source.  IDK about the axis labels.
*[[:Image:Queue length.gif]] another one with axis labels... have to look into possibilities and how en.wp / commons handles this (it's much better to have a single image for all languages than to have to generate a new image for each lang that uses it.  speaking of which... see if commons has similar content and whether there's demand for this kind of stuff elsewhere.

=== [[:Image:Endfire equations.gif]] ===
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\varphi &amp; = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}s\cos(\theta)+\alpha \\
0       &amp; = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}s\cos(0)+\alpha \\
\alpha  &amp; = -\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}s \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore the array factor for an end-fire array is:

:&lt;math&gt;
AF=\left | \frac{\sin(\frac{n\varphi}{2})}{\sqrt{n}\sin(\frac{\varphi}{2})}\right \vert
&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;
\varphi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}s(\cos(\theta)-1)
&lt;/math&gt;

:generally &lt;math&gt;s = \frac{\lambda}{4}&lt;/math&gt; therefore &lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{\pi}{2}(\cos(\theta)-1)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mongolian has been written in a variety of alphabets over the years. The traditional Mongolian script was adapted from Uyghur alphabet in 1208, although it has undergone transformations, and occasionally been supplemented by other scripts.  The Mongolian alphabet was used in Mongolia until 1931, when it was temporarily replaced by the Latin alphabet, and finally by Cyrillic in 1937.  The traditional alphabet was abolished completely by the pro-Soviet government in 1941, and a short-lived attempt to reintroduce the  traditional alphabet after 1990 was abandoned after some years.

In the People's Republic of China, the Mongolian language is a co-official language with Standard Mandarin in some regions, notably the entire Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The traditional alphabet has always been used there, although Cyrillic was considered briefly before the Sino-Soviet split. The classical script used in China in fact represent a very old state of language, and there is no one-to-one correspondence between Cyrillic and classical script.

Currently Mongolian in Outer Mongolia is written in the Cyrillic alphabet. The modified Cyrillic alphabet used for Mongolian is as follows:

Үү and Өө are sometimes written as Vv and Єє, mainly when using Russian software or keyboards that don't support them.

==Notes for good writing==
When writing the iy sound on the end of a back vowel word you write it as ы (this is referred to as the jarin-nigin (sixty one) iy). When writing this sound at the end of front vowel words you write the normal iy: ий.

Examples:
*таны
*цүцгий

:Salutations Whiteknight! Thanks for the thoughtful drive by template welcome! Sarcasm aside, it is actually a lot more helpfully than the corresponding Wikipedia one. Anyways, I hope to be seeing you around depending on how active I become. If WB is anywhere as addictive as WP I imagine that could be quite often.

Thanks for the advice. Hopefully some day I'll get better at this.

All the best.

Welcome to Wikibooks.

I encourage you to continue to boldly make improvements to the books here.

Forgive me for pointing out that it's not really necessary to &quot;correct&quot; words that are already spelled correctly[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=SA_NCS_Mechanical_Technology:Glossary&amp;curid=21352&amp;diff=1250609&amp;oldid=1240301].

Used To give children information about foreign and interesting animals. Cons: Could potentially overlap big cats, on the other hand we could just redirect those animals to the pages in that book.

*My name is Xxagile
*I am 17 years old
*I am going to be a senior this year in high school.
*I enjoy working on the Wikijunior Projects.
*I love the Olympics. I usually don't watch any sports, besides tennis, but when it comes to the Olympics I watch as much as i can.Especially the swimming, basketball, soccer, gymnastics, and track.
*You will probably not see me around here as much when school starts. This is buckle down year for me. That will be August 25th and forward. When I am online I will try to get as much done as possible within that time limit. I will most likely only be on here during the weekends, summer, and school breaks.


* My High School Schedule as it stands now (January 21, 2008):
**Honors English IV
**Contemporary Moral Problems (Online College course)
**Introduction to Sociology (Online College Course)
**Art III / IV

Because of this I don't know how active I will be able to be on this project but we will see.</text>

Hi, I am '''truetech!'''

I currently own and operate a wiki called vindemi.com

I am a long time user on lostpedia.com

I have extensive knowledge of Mediawiki for almost two years now. I know more about wiki than I do about computers (And I have been using computers a long time!)

Cheers!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== XRX as an Application Server ==
XQuery is a transform language in addition to a query language.  Its original name was &quot;Quilt&quot; reflecting its ability to knit together different pieces of (XML) content.

This means that it is good at querying XML data from a data store and transforming it into an XHTML web page.  Any XQuery-capable XML data store that accepts HTTP requests can talk to your web browser and send it an arbitrarily complex, valid (X)HTML document. 

Here is a short example of how XQuery can transform XML database records into valid HTML:

  &lt;customer&gt;&lt;name&gt;bob&lt;/name&gt;  &lt;orders&gt;&lt;order qty=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Jumbo Can SPAM&lt;/order&gt;&lt;/orders&gt; &lt;/customer&gt;

can be &quot;transformed&quot; to HTML:

  &amp;lt;div id='cust'&gt; &amp;lt;b&gt;bob&amp;lt;/b&gt; 
    Orders:
    &amp;lt;ul&gt;
      &amp;lt;li&gt;Jumbo Can SPAM (1)&amp;lt;/li&gt;
    &amp;lt;/ul&gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&gt;

with XQuery something like (not tested):
  let $customer := //customer[name='bob']
  return
  &amp;lt;div id='cust'&gt; &amp;lt;b&gt;{$customer/name/text()}&amp;lt;/b&gt;
    Orders:
    &amp;lt;ul&gt;
    {
      for $o in $customer/orders/order
      return &amp;lt;li&gt;{$o/text()} ({$o/@qty})&amp;lt;/li&gt;
    }
    &amp;lt;/ul&gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&gt;

Many free and commercial XQuery-enabled databases are available.  They include: eXist, MarkLogic, Oracle, DB2, and xHive.  eXist is free, and MarkLogic (and perhaps others) has a free community edition.  Many if not all of them support HTTP requests, and therefore can be used as web/app servers.

eXist:

Although the eXist database was originally created to simply store XML data like a traditional database, the rich REST interfaces that have been added to eXist have transformed it into a web server.  The eXist database is now able to provide a rich set of functions that are only available in other application servers.  What remains is the application development standards that would allow a large number of people developing XRX applications to all work together.

MarkLogic:

MarkLogic is perhaps the most capable XML data management product at this writing.  It combines XML/XQuery with text indexing and retreival, geospatial, alerting, and enterprise class scaling and performance.

xHive (or xDB):

xHive is a state-of-the-art native XML database with XQuery support, transaction control, extensive indexing features and top-class scalability. 

Oracle, DB2:

Oracle and DB2 support XML by incorporating it as a large CLOB field, and support XQuery on this data.

== XRX Application Server Vision ==
The XRX application server can now be set up to allow a wide variety of applications to be installed that all work together.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want all your XForms application to us a single '''save.xq''' submission.  This makes it easier to autogenerate XForms applications and makes it easier to maintain insert and update operations in a central location.

== Method ==
Create a single save XQuery that inspects the content of a POST operation.  Use the name of the root element or other content patterns within the submitted XML file to process the incoming saved documents.  Use a table-driven rule engine to determine if the incoming XML document is a new record (and requires a new ID assigned), an update (and requires versioning), or whether other business rules apply.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want the URLs/URIs in your system to reflect the logical structure of a service, not the collection structure of your database.

== Method 1: Use the Jetty Rewrite Handler ==
Use the Jetty Rewrite Handler that can be installed with the Jetty Server.  The RewriteHandler uses an XML configuration file to store the rewrite patterns of a URI.  This file can contain regular expressions that allow a single rule to be used rewrite a large number of URIs.

== Method 2: Use an Atom interface ==

The eXist native XML database has an [http://exist.sourceforge.net/atompub.html Atom Publishing Protocol] interface.  You can use this to create new URL interfaces to existing XQueries.

== Example ==
Suppose you use XQuery to execute a report of all terms that have changed in the last N days for project P.  Using an eXist XQuery the URL might be

&lt;code&gt;
http://example.com/exist/rest/db/apps/glossary/views/terms-changed.xq?days=N&amp;project=P/
&lt;/code&gt;


The URL rewrite might be:

&lt;code&gt;
http://example.com/terms/new/days=N/project=P/
&lt;/code&gt;

This makes the URL become a more stable application program interface and allows you to move the XQuery to another location in the eXist database and change parameter names without impacting your consumers, their bookmarks, or other systems that access this data through a REST interface.

== Example Using Apache Mod Rewrite ==
The most popular way to implement URL rewriting is to use the Apache web server as a front end to your web application.  This allows you to convert &quot;dynamic&quot; URLs into ones that appear to be &quot;static&quot;, where there are no question marks or ampersands in the URL string and parameters are passed as though they were folders rather than key-value pairs.

Here is the code that would be added to the Apache configuration file:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
Options +FollowSymLinks
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule terms/new/days=(.*)/project=(.*)/ db/apps/glossary/views/terms-changed.xq?days=$1&amp;project=$2
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==AM Receivers==

The most common receivers in use today are the super heterodyne type. They consist of:

::*Antenna
::*RF amplifier
::*Local Oscillator and Mixer
::*IF Section
::*Detector and Amplifier

The need for these subsystems can be seen when one considers the much simpler and inadequate TRF or tuned radio frequency amplifier.

===TRF Amplifier===

It is possible to design an RF amplifier to accept only a narrow range of frequencies, such as one radio station on the AM band.

::::[[Image:TRF_amplifier.gif]]

By adjusting the center frequency of the tuned circuit, all other input signals can be excluded.

::::[[Image:Channel_selection.gif]]

The AM band ranges from about 500 kHz to 1600 kHz. Each station requires 10 kHz of this spectrum, although the baseband signal is only 5 kHz.

Recall that for a tuned circuit: &lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{{f_c }}{B}&lt;/math&gt;. The center or resonant frequency in an RLC network is most often adjusted by varying the capacitor value. However, the Q remains approximately constant as the center frequency is adjusted. This suggests that as the bandwidth varies as the circuit is tuned.

::For example, the Q required at the lower end of the AM band to select only one radio station would be approximately:

::::&lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{{f_c }}{B} = \frac{{500\;kHz}}{{10\;kHz}} = 50&lt;/math&gt;

::As the tuned circuit is adjusted to the higher end of the AM band, the resulting bandwidth is:

::::&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{{f_c }}{Q} = \frac{{1600\;kHz}}{{50}} = 30\;kHz&lt;/math&gt;

A bandwidth this high could conceivably pass three adjacent stations, thus making meaningful reception impossible.

To prevent this, the incoming RF signal is heterodyned to a fixed IF or intermediate frequency and passed through a constant bandwidth circuit.

===Superheterodyne Receiver===

::::[[Image:Heterodyne.gif]]

The RF amplifier boosts the RF signal into the mixer.  It has broad tuning and amplifies not just one RF station, but many of them simultaneously. It also amplifies any input noise and even contributes some of its own.

The other mixer input is a high frequency sine wave created by a local oscillator. In AM receivers, it is always 455 kHz above the desired station carrier frequency. An ideal mixer will combine the incoming carrier with the local oscillator to create sum and difference frequencies. . 

A real mixer combines two signals and creates a host of new frequencies:

::• A dc level
::• The original two frequencies
::• The sum and difference of the two input frequencies
::• Harmonics of the two input frequencies
::• Sums and differences of all of the harmonics

Since the RF amplifier passes several radio stations at once, the mixer output can be very complex. However, the only signal of real interest is the difference between the desired station carrier frequency and the local oscillator frequency. This difference frequency, also called the IF (intermediate frequency) will alway be 455 kHz. By passing this through a 10 kHz BPF (band pass filter) centered at 455 kHz, the bulk of the unwanted signals can be eliminated.

====Local Oscillator Frequency====

Since the mixer generates sum and difference frequencies, it is possible to generate the 455 kHz IF signal if the local oscillator is either above or below the IF. The inevitable question is which is preferable.

::'''Case I The local Oscillator is above the IF.''' This would require that the oscillator tune from (500 + 455) kHz to (1600 + 455) kHz or approximately 1 to 2 MHz. It is normally the capacitor in a tuned RLC circuit, which is varied to adjust the center frequency while the inductor is left fixed. 

::Since &lt;math&gt;f_c  = \frac{1}{{2\pi \sqrt {LC} }}&lt;/math&gt; 

::solving for ''C'' we obtain &lt;math&gt;C = \frac{1}{{L\left( {2\pi f_c } \right)^2 }}&lt;/math&gt;

::When the tuning frequency is a maximum, the tuning capacitor is a minimum and vice versa. Since we know the range of frequencies to be created, we can deduce the range of capacitance required.

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{C_{\max } }}{{C_{\min } }} = \frac{{L\left( {2\pi f_{\max } } \right)^2 }}{{L\left( {2\pi f_{\min } } \right)^2 }} = \left( {\frac{{2\;MHz}}{{1\;MHz}}} \right)^2  = 4&lt;/math&gt;

Making a capacitor with a 4:1 value change is well within the realm of possibility.

::'''Case II The local Oscillator is below the IF'''. This would require that the oscillator tune from (500 - 455) kHz to (1600 - 455) kHz or approximately 45 kHz to 1145 kHz, in which case:

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{C_{\max } }}{{C_{\min } }} = \left( {\frac{{1145\;kHz}}{{45\;kHz}}} \right)^2  \approx 648&lt;/math&gt;

It is not practical to make a tunable capacitor with this type of range. Therefore the local oscillator in a standard AM receiver is above the radio band.

====Image Frequency====

Just as there are two oscillator frequencies, which can create the same IF, two different station frequencies can create the IF. The undesired station frequency is known as the image frequency.

;;;;[[Image:Image_frequency.gif]]

If any circuit in the radio front end exhibits non-linearities, there is a possibility that other combinations may create the intermediate frequency. Once the image frequency is in the mixer, there is no way to remove it since it is now heterodyned into the same IF band as the desired station.

===AM Detection===

There are two basic types of AM detection, coherent and non-coherent. Of these two, the non-coherent is the simpler method.

::*Non-coherent detection does not rely on regenerating the carrier signal. The information or modulation envelope can be removed or detected by a diode followed by an audio filter.
::*Coherent detection relies on regenerating the carrier and mixing it with the AM signal. This creates sum and difference frequencies. The difference frequency corresponds to the original modulation signal.

Both of these detection techniques have certain drawbacks. Consequently, most radio receivers use a combination of both.

====Envelope Detector====

::::[[Image:Envelope_detector.gif]]

An envelope detector is simply a half wave rectifier followed by a low pass filter. In the case of commercial AM radio receivers, the detector is placed after the IF section. The carrier at this point is 455 kHz while the maximum envelope frequency is only 5 kHz. Since the ripple component is nearly 100 times the frequency of the highest baseband signal and does not pass through any subsequent audio amplifiers.

::An AM signal where the carrier frequency is only 10 times the envelope frequency would have considerable ripple:

::::[[Image:Exagerated_am_ripple.gif|300px]]


====Synchronous Detector====

In a synchronous or coherent detector, the incoming AM signal is mixed with the original carrier frequency.

::::[[Image:Synchronous_detector.gif]]

If you think this looks suspiciously like a mixer, you are absolutely right! A synchronous detector is one where the difference frequency between the two inputs is zero Hz. Of in other words, the two input frequencies are the same. Let's check the math.

Recall that the AM input is mathematically defined by:

::::&lt;math&gt;e_{am}  = \underbrace {\sin \omega _c t}_{{\rm{Carrier}}} + \underbrace {\frac{m}{2}\sin \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t}_{{\rm{Lower}}\;{\rm{Sideband}}} - \underbrace {\frac{m}{2}\sin \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t}_{{\rm{Upper}}\;{\rm{Sideband}}}&lt;/math&gt;

::At the multiplier output, we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt;{\rm{mixer}}\;{\rm{out  =  }}e_{am}  \times \sin \omega _c t = \underbrace { - \frac{m}{2}\sin \omega _m t}_{{\rm{Original}}\;{\rm{Modulation}}\;{\rm{Signal}}}\underbrace { - \frac{1}{2}\sin 2\omega _c t - \frac{m}{4}\sin \left( {2\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t + \frac{m}{4}\sin \left( {2\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t}_{{\rm{AM}}\;{\rm{signal}}\;{\rm{centered}}\;{\rm{at}}\;{\rm{2}}\;{\rm{times}}\;{\rm{the}}\;{\rm{carrier}}\;{\rm{frequency}}}&lt;/math&gt;

::The high frequency component can be filtered off leaving only the original modulation signal.

::This technique has one serious drawback. The problem is how to create the exact carrier frequency. If the frequency is not exact, the entire baseband signal will be shifted by the difference. A shift of only 50 Hz will make the human voice unrecognizable. It is possible to use a PLL (phase locked loop), but making one tunable for the entire AM band is not trivial.

As a result, most radio receivers use an oscillator to create a fixed intermediate frequency. This is then followed by an envelope detector or a fixed frequency PLL.

====Squaring Detector====

The squaring detector is also a synchronous or coherent detector. It avoids the problem of having to recreate the carrier by simply squaring the input signal. It essentially uses the AM signal itself as a sort of wideband carrier.

::::[[Image:Squaring_detector.gif]]

::The output of the multiplier is the square of the input AM signal:

::::&lt;math&gt;\left( {e_{am} } \right)^2  = \left( {\sin \omega _c t + \frac{m}{2}\sin \left( {\omega _c  - \omega _m } \right)t - \frac{m}{2}\sin \left( {\omega _c  + \omega _m } \right)t} \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Since the input is being multiplied by the  &lt;math&gt;{\sin \omega _c t}&lt;/math&gt; component, one of the resulting difference terms is the original modulation signal.
The principle difficulty with this approach is trying to create a linear, high frequency multiplier.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The design of steel structures as dictated by modern building codes is governed by various steel specifications. Each specification applies to certain types of construction and is adopted in certain jurisdictions. While the details of each specification are unique, the underlying fundamental concepts are fairly consistent.

The purpose of this volume is to compile those elements of a steel design specification that are fundamental to physics and/or materials sciences and are commonly accepted by the major steel specifications. The final goal of this project is to provide a document that over time will serve as a baseline that will lead to greater agreement between the adopted steel specifications. Also, this document will provide a good basis for education by focusing on fundamentals rather than the details of a specific specification.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

== Scope ==

== Definitions ==

== Material ==

== Analysis of cross section ==
The determination of the strength of a member under a particular limit state shall consider the applicable states of stress within the cross section under the imposed axial, shear, flexural and torsional loadings.  The cross section may be analyzed under the combined state of stress or interaction equations may be used to combine member strengths or stress levels as applicable.
===Constitutive Relationship (Stress-Strain)===
In general, for each limit state considered within the provisions of this specification, the constitutive relationship between element stress and engineering strain shall be assumed to take to form a three part curve with a linear portion up to the yield strain, a perfectly plastic portion from the yield strain to the onset of strain-hardening, and a strain-hardening portion up to the point of ultimate stress or the rupture strain.  For limit states not involving rupture, the strain-hardening portion may be neglected to from an elastic-plastic model.  For certain flexural limit states involving high strains and for plastic analysis, the elastic and strain-hardening portions may be neglected to form a rigid-plastic model.

== Load and load combinations ==
Member loads, responses, or stresses shall be combined using applicable load combinations from the applicable building code.  The selected load combinations shall account for statistical variations in loading and/or incorporate factors of safety in a manner consistent with the design methodology used.

== Design basis ==

== Limit states==
The nominal strength of a section shall be limited so that no applicable strength or serviceability limit state shall be execeeded under the applicalbe load combinations.

==Lesson 3==

Welcome to Lesson 3.  In this lesson, you will be taught row 3:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ر ڑ ز ژ س ش ص ض &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;


Rē, ṛē, zē, and zhē all change form in the same way.

Likewise, the pairs sīn and shīn, and suāt and zuāt change form similarly.

(Note: rē, ṛē, zē, and zhē are all non-connectors.)

==rē - ر==

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ل م ن و ہ ھ ی ے &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;


All of these letters change form differently, but dō chashmī hē doesn't work like the other letters do, and chhōṭī yē and baḍī yē have the same initial and medial forms.  This will all be explained as you proceed.

== Exponential Growth and Decay ==
''2 unit course''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The exponential function can be used to show the growth or decay of a given variable, including the growth or decay of population in a city, the heating or cooling of a body, radioactive decay of radioisotopes in nuclear chemistry, and amount of bacteria in a culture.

The exponential growth and decay formula is
&lt;math&gt; N = N&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sup&gt;kt&lt;/sup&gt;

where: &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the first value of ''N'' (where &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/b&gt; represents time in given units (seconds, hours, days, years, etc.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the exponential constant (&lt;math&gt;e = 2.718281828...&lt;/math&gt;), and&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the growth (&lt;math&gt;k +ve&lt;/math&gt;) or decay(&lt;math&gt;k -ve&lt;/math&gt;) constant.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Differentiation can be used to show that the rate of change (with respect to time, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;) of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is proportional (∞) to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.
if:&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; N = N&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sup&gt;kt&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;br&gt; then the Derivative of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; can be show as:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;dN&lt;/u&gt;       &lt;math&gt;=kN&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sup&gt;kt&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;dt&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=kN&lt;/math&gt;, substituting &lt;math&gt; N = N&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sup&gt;kt&lt;/sup&gt;.

(note the derivative of ''e'' is the variable &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of the power of ''e'' times &lt;math&gt;e^{kx}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; N, t&lt;/math&gt; are constant.)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


== 3 Unit applications ==
''not yet complete''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The variable of a given application can be proportionate to the ''difference'' between the variable and a constant. An example of this is the internal cooling of a body as it adjusts to the external room temperature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;dN&lt;/u&gt; = &lt;math&gt; k(N - P)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
dt&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;= kN&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sup&gt;kt&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;- kP&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; = the external constant (e.g., the external room temperature)


using natural logarithms, &lt;math&gt;log&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, we can find any variable when given certain information.&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;br&gt;
A cup of boiling water is initially &lt;math&gt; 100&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. The external room temperature is &lt;math&gt; 24&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. after 10 minutes, the temperature of the water is &lt;math&gt; 74&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. find&lt;br&gt;
(i) k&lt;br&gt;
(ii)how many minutes it takes for the temperature to equal 30 degrees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

(i)&lt;math&gt;74=24-100&lt;/math&gt;''e''&lt;sup&gt;10k&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;50=-100&lt;/math&gt;''e''&lt;sup&gt;10k&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac {50} {-100} = e^{10k}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;log&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;1 - log&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;(-2) = 10k&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{log_e 1 - log_e(-2)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

= .34567359... (store in memory)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(ii) 30=24-100e^(.34657359t)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The cc-by-sa licensing is unacceptable, as there is no reliable way to ensure contributors other that Rob have agreed to this. I'm going to remove it in one week unless there are objections with convincing reasoning.

:First of all, under what possible authority do you have to &quot;remove this&quot; page or this licensing agreement from this wikibook?  If you look very carefully at the dates, this license term of being dual licensed was initiated immediately at the beginning when this wikibook was created, and I tried to make it abundantly clear that all of the pages were dual-licensed by anybody who was contributing to this.

:Yeah, I'll admit that this is an experiment in dual-licensing content, but I strongly disagree with your interpretation of what could or could not happen on Wikibooks.  I guess I do consider this to be &quot;an objection&quot;

:Please read the rationale for why I am asking for this content to be dual-licensed... well above and beyond &quot;just because&quot;.  This is deliberately being written explicitly to be compatible with the other Scratch related documentation and content... which BTW is exclusively being distributed under the terms of CC-by-SA.

:I have asked for legitimate discussion about this matter by any potential contributors to this project, but threats of deletion of the content doesn't seem like a good way to start that sort of discussion.

:I also don't understand for the life of me why a wikibook can't be dual-licensed, but that is another discussion for another page and forum.  Please don't make this book the fall guy for such a drastic change of project policy until all of the issues are vetted.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 03:43, 15 August 2008 (UTC)
::Sorry, I don't see anyone who wants to delete content. I agree you have a good reason for doing so - that's not my issue. I simply fail to see how the book is actually dual licensed at this point - there are contributors which have not agreed to the second license. Unless you can show some proof they have done so, they haven't. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:48, 15 August 2008 (UTC)
:::The &quot;proof&quot; that I'm using in terms of suggesting that this book is still dual-licensed is two fold:  
:::*All additions to this book by other authors are essentially minor and trivial edits (weak proof, but it is some sort of &quot;proof&quot;).  None of them would qualify as a significant author/contributor under the terms of the GFDL, but that is something up for debate.  I'm not trying to &quot;own&quot; this book, but I am pointing out that nobody else has contributed yet.  If/when somebody else does in a meaningful way, it can be something where other stake holders can help address/sort out what the situation will be.
:::*The &quot;dual license&quot; nature of the wikibook has been made apparent on nearly every page of this book, with disclaimers to that effect on every page.  IMHO, if dual-licensed content is to be permitted on Wikibooks, it is precisely in this manner that it should happen.  The very fact this license page even exists should speak volumes for at least the intent to keep and maintain this dual-license situation.
:::All of this will be moot if the Free Software Foundation and the Wikimedia Foundation seem to work out a compromise license that would allow GFDL'd content to become CC-by-SA (or similar licensed) content.  I have doubts about that happening in spite of folks like Mike Godwin and nearly the whole of the WMF board trying to make it happen, but that is my own political opinion on that topic.
:::By deleting this page (the license page), it is in effect forcing this dual-license nature of this particular wikibook to become GFDL-only.  I don't want to involve a bunch of lawyers into this game, and I'm not going to try and disrupt Wikibooks by doing so.  But what I see here is an attempt to interpret the law according to a certain point of view when such a POV isn't necessarily universal nor is there legal precedence to justify such a viewpoint either.  As far as I know, the GFDL itself hasn't been tested in court, much less any sort of dual-licensing efforts on wikis where some &quot;downstream user&quot; is attempting to act under the terms of the 2nd license when the first license was clearly marked as it is here on Wikibooks.
:::For me, this is really an issue of freedom.  I added this content under a dual-license to give the freedom for those who want to use the contents of this book jointly with the software that it is describing the opportunity to not have to worry about licenses.  Life is so complicated as it is that having to deal with the minutae of content licensing should be the last thing somebody using this wikibook should have to worry about.  If they copy some examples from this wikibook and blend them into Scratch with some content from the main MIT-Scratch website, they shouldn't have to be worrying about license incompatibility.  I'm also hoping (but not counting on) the folks at MIT using Wikibooks as a place they can encourage user participation of documentation about the project.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 10:36, 20 August 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Need to develop the naming section. In particular, I need a strategy for finding/giving answers
to questions posed in the text. Philosophically, one wants/needs the reader to try to find
the answer for her/him-self before revealing either the strategy or answer.

I will experiment here: the question to be resolved is the &quot;naming law&quot; of 1924.

I expect the answer to be found on Wikipedia...
(Михал Орела 06:46, 9 August 2008 (UTC))

The date was 1934. (Михал Орела 06:52, 9 August 2008 (UTC))

As of 2008-11-17:
(i) &lt;http://www.google.com/search?q=naming+law+1934+June+21&gt; _finds_
a Wikipedia entry (&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_name&gt;), as
can be expected, of course, as the second hit;
(ii) &lt;http://www.google.com/search?q=naming+law+1934+June+21+-Wikipedia&gt;
finds a relevant page as well

== ‎Vocabulary ==

Welcome to the Vocabulary module of Punjabi wikibook!

'''''If you have not mastered the Gurmukhi script you are strongly advised to go back to the [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi|Gurmukhi]] script module and practise thoughly before returning. In this module you will be expected to have basic skill of using the letters, matras and the diacritics and to read the printed/written Punjabi words.'''''

The module has been divided into lessons, each lesson consisting of a classified group of words. 
Some of the lessons are sub divided into sessions depending upon the amount of vocabulary 
it contains. You are expected to devote about an hour to each lesson/session 
in which you will learn about 20 to 30 words. After you are through with this module you will 
have a wealth of 400 to 500 commonly spoken Punjabi words.

During the course of the module you will also learn 
some linguistic patterns and rules of grammar. 
The linguistic pattern or rules of grammar are not required to be memorized, 
rather you should look out for understanding the language points from these rules/patterns.

== Numbers ==

Numbers between twenty and twenty nine are composed in English with recuring use of twenty 
such as twenty one, twenty two, twenty three etc. 
Similar recurrence in thirties, forties and so on and so forth makes it very easy to 
learn these numbers in English. Similar recurrence occurs in Punjabi after hundred. 
That makes it necessary to learn first hundred numbers of Punjabi by memorizing. 
Fortunately there are linguistic patterns in the series of numbers. 
The job of memorization is thus made easier to that extent. 
In this lesson you will learn the numbers in Punjabi. 
We will carry you through explaining these linguistic patterns.

This lesson is some what differently modelled. The lesson will be divided into four sessions. 
Each session will be learnt in about one/two hours time. 

== Session one ==

This session is devoted to learning numbers from one to twenty. 
First ten numbers are all irregular as is the case in English too 
and will be learnt by memorizing to help in spotting the linguistic patterns in later numbers. 
Once you have learnt the first ten numbers you will be shown their correspondence with the next ten.  

ਇੱਕ = one &lt;br&gt;
ਦੋ = two &lt;br&gt;
ਤਿੰਨ = three &lt;br&gt;
ਚਾਰ = four &lt;br&gt;
ਪੰਜ = five &lt;br&gt;
ਛੇ = six &lt;br&gt;
ਸੱਤ = seven &lt;br&gt;
ਅੱਠ = eight &lt;br&gt;
ਨੌਂ = nine &lt;br&gt;
ਦਸ = ten &lt;br&gt;

So you have learnt the first ten numbers in Punjabi. The interesting part realy begins now. 
As with English numbers one and eleven, ਇਕ and ਗਿਆਰਾਂ have no linguistic similarity. 
Absence of any linguistic similarity between ਦੋ and ਬਾਰਾਂ contrasts with presence of 
such similarity in English between two and twelve. 
But then onward until nineteen corrensponding pairs have similarity in both Punjabi and English. 
Now examine the following numbers and observe the strikingly similar features of Punjabi and English.

ਗਿਆਰਾਂ = eleven &lt;br&gt;
ਬਾਰਾਂ = twelve &lt;br&gt;
ਤੇਰਾਂ = thirteen &lt;br&gt;
ਚੌਦਾਂ = fourteen &lt;br&gt;
ਪੰਦਰਾਂ = fifteen &lt;br&gt;
ਸੋਲ਼ਾਂ = sixteen &lt;br&gt;
ਸਤਾਰਾਂ = seventeen &lt;br&gt;
ਅਠਾਰਾਂ = eighteen &lt;br&gt;
ਉਨੀ = nineteen &lt;br&gt;
ਵੀਹ = twenty &lt;br&gt;

== Session two ==

In the first session of this lesson you have already learnt numbers from one to twenty. In this session the remaining numbers upto hundred will be introduced at one go to enable you to study the patterns in the series of numbers. You will find linguistic patterns in the corresponding numbers in each series of ten numbers e.g. twenty one, thirty one, forty one and so on. We will examine these patterns once you have a close look at the number below.

Sure enough there is no need to get intimidated by this array of numbers. 
They are easy to learn with the help of linguistic patterns that 
the rows and columns of this table follow. 
We will help you learn them by explaining these linguistic patterns. 
Let us first examine the first row containing twenty one, thirty one....  
These numbers are 
:ਇੱਕੀ, ਇਕੱਤੀ, ਇਕਤਾਲੀ, ਇਕਵਿੰਜਾ, ਇਕਾਠ, ਇਕ੍ਹੱਤਰ, ਇਕਾਸੀ and ਇਕਆਨਵੇਂ 
You will note that each of these numbers is composed by combining ਇਕ, that is one with ਵੀਹ, ਤੀਹ etc. 
It is interesting to note that while one succeeds twenty, thirty etc. in 
English its equivalent ਇਕ precedes ਵੀਹ, ਤੀਹ etc. in Punjabi.  

Also when combining ਵੀਹ and ਇਕ, while ਇਕ comes first, ਵੀਹ becomes ਈ to yield ਇਕ + ਈ = ਇੱਕੀ. 
Similarly ਤੀਹ becomes ਤੀ, ਚਾਲੀ - ਤਾਲੀ, ਪੰਜਾਹ - ਵਿੰਜਾ, ਸੱਠ - ਠ, ਸੱਤਰ - ਤਰ, ਅੱਸੀ - ਸੀ and ਨੱਬੇ - ਆਨਵੇਂ. 
Like wise when ਇਕ combine with ਤੀਹ it yields ਇਕ + ਤੀ = ਇਕੱਤੀ or with say ਅੱਸੀ it yields ਇਕ + ਸੀ = ਇਕਾਸੀ. 
This pattern continues with ਦੋ, ਤਿੰਨ, ਚਾਰ, ਪੰਜ, ਛੇ, ਸੱਤ, ਅੱਠ, ਨੌਂ as well.

Similar patterns are found in other series also. See the series of numbers ending with two. 
While two is ਦੋ in Punjabi all other numbers in this series start with ਬ. 
Here is the complete series ਦੋ, ਬਾਰਾਂ, ਬਾਈ, ਬੱਤੀ, ਬਤਾਲੀ, ਬਵਿੰਜਾ, ਬਾਠ੍ਹ, ਬਹੱਤਰ, ਬਿਆਸੀ, ਬਿਆਨਵੇਂ. 
Same goes for corresponding series of numbers ending with ਤਿੰਨ, ਚਾਰ, ਪੰਜ, ਛੇ, ਸੱਤ, ਅੱਠ, ਨੌਂ.

== Session three ==

You have already learnt numbers from one to hundred. 
Higher numbers are formed by combining these basic numbers with some more numbers which we give hereunder

ਸੌ = hundred &lt;br&gt;
ਹਜਾਰ = thousand &lt;br&gt;
ਲੱਖ = lac = one hundred thousand &lt;br&gt;
ਕਰੋੜ = crore = ten million &lt;br&gt;
ਅਰਬ = billion &lt;br&gt;
ਖਰਬ = hundred billion &lt;br&gt;

The following examples will show you how the numbers upto ninty nine 
combine with hundred, thousand, lac, crore etc. to yield higher numbers. 

ਇੱਕ ਸੌ ਇੱਕ = one hundred one &lt;br&gt;
ਇੱਕ ਸੌ ਦੋ = one hundred two &lt;br&gt;
ਇੱਕ ਸੌ ਤਿੰਨ = one hundred three &lt;br&gt;
........... &lt;br&gt;
................ &lt;br&gt;
ਨੌਂ ਸੌ ਇੱਕ = nine hundred one &lt;br&gt;
........... &lt;br&gt;
ਨੌਂ ਸੌ ਨਿੜੱਨਵੇਂ = nine hundred ninety nine &lt;br&gt;
ਹਜਾਰ = thousand &lt;br&gt;
ਇੱਕ ਹਜਾਰ ਇੱਕ = one thousand one &lt;br&gt;
................ &lt;br&gt;
................... &lt;br&gt;
ਇੱਕ ਹਜਾਰ ਇੱਕ ਸੌ ਇਕ = one thousand one hundred one &lt;br&gt;
........................ &lt;br&gt;
ਨੌਂ ਹਜਾਰ ਨੌਂ ਸੌ ਨਿੜੱਨਵੇਂ = nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine &lt;br&gt;

and so on and so forth.

== Session four ==

'''Ordinal numbers''' : If you have learnt the above cardinal numbers you can move on to the following corresponding ordinal numbers. Here again that the first four ordinals can not be derived from the corresponding cardinals by any general formula but you will easily discern that the derivatives are closely related to their roots. The ordinal forms of later cardinals are obtained by adding ਵਾਂ to either the original form of the cardinal or after removing the last kanna.

ਪਹਿਲਾ = first &lt;br&gt;
ਦੂਜਾ = second &lt;br&gt;
ਤੀਜਾ = third &lt;br&gt;
ਚੌਥਾ = fourth &lt;br&gt;
ਪੰਜਵਾਂ = fifth &lt;br&gt;
ਛੇਵਾਂ = sixth &lt;br&gt;
ਸੱਤਵਾਂ = seven &lt;br&gt;
ਅੱਠਵਾਂ = eight &lt;br&gt;
ਨੌਂਵਾਂ = nine &lt;br&gt;
ਦਸਵਾਂ = ten &lt;br&gt;

The rule of adding ਵਾਂ to either the original form of the cardinal or after 
removing the last kanna continues not only to the following numbers till 
twenty but thereafter as well.

ਗਿਆਰਵਾਂ = eleventh &lt;br&gt;
ਬਾਹਰਵਾਂ = twelfth &lt;br&gt;
ਤੇਹਰਵਾਂ = thirteenth &lt;br&gt;
ਚੌਦਵਾਂ = fourteenth &lt;br&gt;
ਪੰਦਰਵਾਂ = fifteenth &lt;br&gt;
ਸੋਲ਼ਵਾਂ = sixteenth &lt;br&gt;
ਸਤਾਰਵਾਂ = seventeenth &lt;br&gt;
ਅਠਾਰਵਾਂ = eighteenth &lt;br&gt;
ਉਨੀਵਾਂ = nineteenth &lt;br&gt;
ਵੀਹਵਾਂ = twentieth &lt;br&gt;

Now we introduce the concept of gender in ordinal numbers. 
The cardinal numbers are of neuter gender. 
Now have a look at the ordinals ਪੰਜਵਾਂ to ਵੀਹਵਾਂ above. All of them end in ਵਾਂ. 
Even the first four also end with kanna. 
This form of number names ending in kanna or kanna with bindi is called a regular 
form and all of them are masculine. 
Their feminine form is obtained by replacing kanna with bihari. 
Thus ਪਹਿਲਾ becomes ਪਹਿਲੀ, ਦੂਜਾ - ਦੂਜੀ, ਤੀਜਾ - ਤੀਜੀ, ਚੌਥਾ - ਚੌਥੀ and ਪੰਜਵਾਂ - ਪੰਜਵੀਂ and so on and so forth.

''The following ordinals are provided for reference purposes only. There is no need to memorize them before proceeding.''

{{wikipedia| Public_switched_telephone_network}}

From the western perspective, the telephone is ubiquitous. However, the reality is that 80% of the world’s population have limited access to one.

To the average person, the telephone system is simply a ‘black box’. Relatively few people need to know how the PSTN works. The main consideration is that it works, and is relatively inexpensive. The PSTN has a designed reliability of 99.999% (called 5 nines reliability).


===A Telephone Call===

To make a telephone call, one simply picks up the handset, enters a number, and waits for the system to perform its magic:

::*Lifting the handset from its cradle releases a hook switch and causes a dc current to flow (20 - 120 ma). The central office monitors this loop current and interprets it as a request for service.

::*The office acknowledges the request for service by sending dial tone. This normally occurs in less time than it takes to pickup the handset and place it to the ear. Once dial tone has been received, the subscriber starts to dial.

::*In the past, when dialing, a rotary dial switch opened and closed the loop in a predetermined manner. If one was very coordinated, it was possible to perform the same task by flashing the hook switch. To assure the customer that the system is responding, dial tone is removed once dialing starts. In most systems today DTMF (dual tone multi frequency) signaling is used [http://communication.howstuffworks.com/telephone.htm How Telephones Work]

::*Depending upon the office type and digits received, a number of things might happen. In most cases, end-users are attached to what is called a class 5 or end-office. These are the most common types of telephone exchanges. Each class 5 office has one or more, three digit exchange numbers. These are the first three digits in an ordinary 7-digit telephone number.

::*If the central office includes the customer dialed exchange number, it will know that the call is local and the other party is connected to the same office. The office will therefor control the entire call setup and takedown.

::*If the first three digits do not correspond to an exchange handled by the end-office, it will have to find a trunk line to an office that can handle the call. This means that each office must know the exchange numbers of all the offices within its calling area, and how to get to them. The call setup and takedown will therefor be shared between the two exchanges. They must monitor the call in progress and inform each other of any change in call status.

::*If the first digit dialed is a one, the office will recognize this as a long distance call, and will start looking for a spare toll trunk. A toll office has a greater knowledge base as to where distant exchanges are located and how to get to them.

::*The telephone system must be intelligent enough to recognize that in a local call, only seven digits are usually required. Some very small exchanges however, allow local calls by omitting the exchange number and using only the last 4 digits or extension number. In large urban areas, it may be necessary to prefix local calls with a 3-digit area code. An international call may require up to 16 digits.

::*Once the entire number has been received, the office at each end of the connection must alert both parties as to what is happening. At the originating end, a ringing tone is sent to the speaker in the handset. At the terminating end, the office is generating a much larger ringing voltage to activate a bell.

::*The far-end-office monitors the line to determine if someone answers the ringing phone. This is done by examining the DC current drawn when the far-end customer lifts the handset, inducing loop current through the hook switch. The far-end-office must then disconnect the ringing before the handset reaches the ear, and signals back to the originating office that someone has picked up the phone. The origination office must then disconnect the ring back tone and complete the voice connection.

::*Both end-offices monitor their respective loop currents during the entire call to determine if one party hangs up. Once this happens, one end-office signals the other, and dial tone is placed on the loop. This alerts the remaining party that the connection has been terminated.

::*If the line is in use, the central office will not set up the connection and return a busy tone to the originator. By doing this switching, call processing, and transmission resources are not being tied up unnecessarily. However, there are a number of options such as call forwarding and call waiting which modify this process.

::*With call forwarding, a call to a busy number is routed to an answering service. With call waiting, the calling party hears a ringing tone, and the called party hears a beep, which they can either ignore or signal back to the office that the new call should be given priority over the existing call. If however, the call cannot be completed because the system itself is too busy, it returns a fast busy tone to the originator.

::*In a touch-tone environment, the same procedure is followed, except that tones are used to convey numbers to the local office instead of interrupting loop current. Some calling features, generally known as CLASS (Custom Local Area Signaling Services) , are available in areas with touch-tone service.


====But where do the telephone wires go?====

The telephone line goes to a terminal block in a service area interface. These are often located on a pole or small enclosure on the street. The service area interface bundles the subscriber drop cables into a single larger cable. These are in turn gathered together to form larger feeder cables. The entire wiring system somewhat resembles a huge tree.

Cables coming out of a central office may have hundreds or even thousands of pairs bundled together however by the time the cable gets to the end user, it is generally down to about 50 pairs. An individual subscriber consists of many cable sections spliced together. Bellcore claims that the average U.S. subscriber line has twenty-two splices.

Feeder cables enter the central office in a large underground room called a cable vault. Each feeder may contain hundreds of pairs of wires, and be pressurized in order to prevent moisture or ground water from entering and affecting the transmission characteristics of the wire. A typical vault may contain tens of thousands of wire pairs.

The cables pass through the vault and are terminated on the vertical side of the MDF (main distribution frame) . To protect the central office equipment from high voltage transients, such as lightning strikes, which may travel down the wire, the lines are surge protected by carbon blocks or gas tubes.

The horizontal side of the MDF, connects the incoming telephone lines to the peripheral equipment. All that is required to connect a line appearance to a specific interface is to place a jumper between the vertical and horizontal sides of the MDF.

Signals coming from an end-user are generally analog in nature. Consequently, the peripheral equipment converts the signals to digital form before passing them on to the rest of the network.

Incoming trunks from other central offices are comprised of specialized carrier systems. They may be either analog or digital, but all new systems are strictly digital.

Most end-user voice &amp; data interfaces are multiplexed on to high-speed paths, which pass through the internal switching, network before being routed to outgoing lines or trunks. Incoming digital carrier systems may be accepted directly into the switching network through a cross-connect or may be demultiplexed prior to switching.

==PSTN Hierarchy==


:[[Image:Local_network.gif|left|thumb]]

Historically the telephone network was composed of a hierarchical structure consisting of 5 different office types. The most common of these is the class 5 end-office. An end-office connects directly to subscriber telephone sets and performs switching functions over a relatively small area. Telephone exchanges connect to subscribers by means of local loops or lines, generally one per customer. Telephone offices connect to each other by means of trunks.

A class 5 or end-office interconnects telephones throughout a small service area. Each end-office may contain several three-digit exchange numbers and is aware of other local exchange numbers held by other offices.

Calls between offices are routed over interoffice or tandem trunks. Long distance calls are routed to toll offices via toll trunks. The average class 5 office serves approximately 41,000 subscribers, and covers 30 square km in an urban environment.

Some nodes may have no customers at all, and may be connected only to other nodes. These inter-node or trunk connections are usually made by FDM or TDM transmission links.


===Exchange Area Network===

:[[Image:Trunk_connection.gif|left|thumb]]

An exchange network consists of local and tandem exchanges connected by trunks. A tandem office interconnects class 5 offices by means of twisted pair, coax, microwave, or fiber optic carriers. Alternate routing paths between local exchanges are provided if the direct trunks are occupied.

An exchange area includes all of the offices, which are aware of each other, but do not involve long distance charges. In very large urban areas, there is an overlap between exchange areas, which may also cross over area code boundaries.


===Long Haul Network===

:[[Image:Long_haul_network.gif|left|thumb]]


A long haul network consists of exchanges interconnected by toll offices. Toll offices keep track of long distance charges and are typically confined to national boundaries. These trunks consist of high capacity coax, microwave, or glass fiber.

Messages used to control the call setup and takedown can be sent by two basic methods. Traditionally, inter-office messages are sent over the same channel that will carry the voice path, but in newer systems, common channel signaling is being employed. In this method, the offices have dedicated facilities, which are used to send inter-office messages. There are some advantages to this, perhaps the notable being the added degree of difficulty encountered if one wants to defraud the system. When in-band signaling was used, it was possible for people to dial long distance calls without being charged, if they created the tones used to disable the toll circuit.


===Interoffice Signaling===

Trunks are used to interconnect the various levels of telephone exchanges. It is necessary for these links to exchange on a wide range of information including:
::• Call related signaling messages
::• Billing information
::• Routing and flow control signals
::• Maintenance test signals


There are two ways for telephone offices to communicate with each other and pass on routing information. Information can be conveyed in the same channel that will be used to convey the voice signal, or it may be completely disassociated with it.


====CAS====

{{Wikipedia|Channel_Associated_Signaling}}

The CAS (Channel Associated Signaling) approach uses the voice channel to send information through a trunk. For example, a 2600 Hz tone is used in interoffice trunks to signal on-hook. A major disadvantage of this system is that subscribers can bypass toll centers by injecting the appropriate tones. One way to avoid this problem is by using out-of- band signals on toll trunks. Since the customer’s signal must pass through an audio anti-aliasing filter, it is not possible to inject the out-of-band signaling tone.

A principle advantage of in-channel signaling is that the integrity of the voice path is checked each time a connection is established. Out-of-band signaling allows for continuous supervision of the connection throughout the call.


====CCIS====

{{Wikipedia|Common_Channel_Interoffice_Signaling}}

The CCIS (Common Channel Interoffice Signaling) approach has the signaling information conveyed on a facility completely separated from the customer’s voice path. This allows for a faster, more efficient control, however the reliability of the CCS network must be considerably greater than that of the individual voice paths. The signaling channel may follow the same route as the final connection path, or it may be completely disassociated with it. STPs (Switch Transfer Point) are need in the network if the signaling path is disassociated, thus effectively creating two networks: a speech network and a signaling network overlay.



====SS7====

{{Wikipedia|Signaling_System_7}}

Virtually all calls requiring tandem or toll office routing are established and controlled by the SS7 signaling network.

The SS7 signaling network is a packet switching facility comprised primarily of STPs (Signaling Transfer Point) and SCPs (Service Control Point)  connected to the PSTN SSP (Signal Switching Point). STPs are deployed in pairs and are the brains of the system. They determine which trunks and offices should be used in establishing inter-office connections.

The SCP is a database that keeps track of such things as: credit card authorization, virtual network subscriber listings, 800 number conversion tables, billing, and other special services.

==Class 5 Office==

{{Wikipedia| Central_office}}

A telephone [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PvysubRl2Y central office] is often referred to as a switch because it switches or routes calls. Regardless of who makes them, all class 5 offices have the same objectives, and therefor have similar structures. The three major components found in any modern switching systems are; the central control, network, and peripherals.


===A Generic Communication Switch===

:[[Image:Generic_switch.gif|left|thumb]]

The internal architecture of a telecommunications switch is somewhat like the organization of the entire system. The internal structure is often illustrated by the traditional pyramid or hierarchical arrangement. The control or brains of the operation are shown at the top, and the peripheral units that connect to the outside world are placed at the bottom.

Physically, the switch is simply a series of boxes, full of electronics:

:[[Image:Nortel_DMS100_public_voice_exchange.jpg|left|thumb]]


The MTBF (mean time between failure) for any PSTN switch must be very long, since business would soon grind to a halt if telephone traffic was interrupted for a prolonged period, but more importantly, emergency services would be severely curtailed. For these reasons, large public switches have a great deal of redundancy built in. Redundancy is provided in two basic ways; hot standby and load sharing.

In the hot standby arrangement, two or more processors are fed with the identical information and are making decisions, however, only one of these processors is in charge and is executing decisions. In the event of a failure, the healthy unit assumes the full load. There is no degradation in performance, and no calls in progress should be lost.

In a load-sharing configuration, all processors are actively working but not to their full capacity. In the event of a failure, the defective processor is isolated from the system, and the others pick up the slack. There may be degradation in performance, and calls in progress on the defective processor may be lost.


====Peripheral Layer====

The periphery is the outermost layer in any system. It contains the interface to all outgoing lines and trunks.



====Network Layer====

The network switch does the actual routing of signals from one customer or port to another. Switching can be done in either the space or time domain. Initially, all switching was done by mechanical contacts in the space domain. Today most switches are digital in nature and operate mainly in the time domain. However, some degree of space switching is always required since signals must ultimately be routed from one line to another.

Networks always provide some form of concentration. That is to say, not all customers can be handled simultaneously. Statistical analysis shows that in the majority of cases, the switch needs only to handle about 20% of all the subscribers at one time. This is similar to highway systems where the roads are designed to handle not all vehicles simultaneously, but only a certain peak load.


====Central Control====

This contains the system intelligence and customer database. It knows who the customers are, what they want, and how to provide the service they require.
 
In a step x step [step by step] switch, the intelligence is fully distributed and there is no central control, whereas in a crossbar facility, all of the intelligence is resident in a central controller or computer. In all modern systems the intelligence is somewhat distributed, with various functional blocks contributing to the decision making process.

At onetime there was a sharp distinction between computers and telecom switches, but today this division is less clear, and central controllers may be regarded as a specialized computer.

==Specialized Components==

There are some components associated with telephone systems that deserve special consideration.

===Line Cards===

:[[Image:LineCard2.jpg|right|thumb]]

Line cards are the single most common component in a telephone office. It is a very complex device that contains a wide range of technologies.

The   (telephone) line interface is often referred to as a BORSCHT circuit. 

This acronym describes the functional requirements of a standard telephone line interface. The tip and ring leads of the telephone set are wired through some protection devices to the line interface located in the peripheral module. This interface must perform the following functions:

::B	Battery feed
::O	Over voltage protection
::R	Ringing
::S	Supervision &amp; Signaling
::C	Coding 
::H	Hybrid
::T	Test


:[[Image:Telephone_line.gif|left|thumb]]

Many of these functions can be integrated into a single IC, often called a SLIC chip (subscriber line interface chip). SLICs have been available for the PBX market for over a decade. Recently however, they have also become available for the central office environment as well.


:'''B - Battery Feed'''

Most domestic appliances are powered from an electric utility grid. The notable exception to this is the telephone. This is because the telephone should still operate in the event of a power failure. Indeed, the telephone is vital in case of disaster or emergency.

The telephone office provides a nominal -48 volt dc feed to power the phone. This magnitude is considered the maximum safe dc operating potential. It would not be in the telephone company’s best interest to provide a dc voltage, which could electrocute its customers, or it’s own employees. A negative potential was chosen to reduce corrosive action on buried cables.

Multi-function telephones cannot always be powered from the telephone exchange and often require an alternate power source. For this reason, sophisticated line interfaces such as ISDN SAA interfaces have a ‘fail to POTS’ mode. If the electric power fails, the complex phone cannot function to full capacity. The telephone exchange can sense the local power outage through the telephone loop and switches to POTS only service.

The POTS loop requires a nominal -48 v at 20 – 100 ma dc to maintain a voice and signaling path. The earpiece in the handset does not require biasing, but the carbon microphone does. Subscriber signaling is performed by temporarily placing a short circuit on the loop thus changing the loop current, which is then sensed at the central office.

:[[Image:Voltage_feed.gif|left|thumb]]

There are several ways to provide loop current, the simplest being a resistor in series with a battery.

:[[Image:Current_feed.gif|right|thumb]]

Another way to provide loop current is by an electronic current source.

Although this method is quite complex, it has become quite popular with the advent of high voltage bipolar technology. One of the more difficult requirements to meet is the 60-dB longitudinal line balance requirement. To achieve this, the impedance to ground on each side of the loop, must match within 0.1%. This is easy to do with laser trimmed thick film resistors, but a bit tricky with current sources.

:[[Image:AWG_loop_length.gif|thumb|right]]

A standard telephone requires a minimum of about 20 ma. This means that the maximum possible loop resistance is about 2000 &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. In actual practice, the loop is generally limited to 1250 W. The maximum loop length is determined by the wire gauge. 


:'''O - Over-voltage Protection'''

The two major types of over-voltage that can occur are lightning strikes and power line contact. In both cases, the circuit must either recover or fail-safe. Under no circumstances can a surge be allowed to propagate further into the system, or create a fire.

Initial surge protection is provided at the MDF by gas tubes and/or carbon blocks, which arc if the applied voltage exceeds a few hundred volts. Since these devices take a finite time to respond, high-speed diodes are also used at the line circuit inputs.

:'''R - Ringing'''

Ringing is often provided by means of a dedicated ringing generator that is connected onto the loop by means of a relay. It is possible to generate ringing voltages at the line interface if the current generators have a high enough voltage source available to them. Or alternately, a switching converter with step up capability can be place on the interface.

In Canada, the ringing voltage is a nominal 86 Vrms at 20 Hz, with a 2 second on and 4 second off cycle. On rural party lines, ringing codes of long and short rings are sometimes used.

In the U.S. there are a number of fully selective and semi-selective ringing methods used on party lines. One employs different frequencies ranging from about 16 – 66 Hz. In such cases, each telephone ringer is tuned to its own frequency. Other methods use positive and negative battery voltages or apply ringing on either the tip or ring side of the line with respect to ground.


:'''S - Supervision &amp; Signaling'''

The central office must supervise the loop in order to identify customer requests for service. A request for service is initiated by going off-hook. This simply draws loop current from the CO.

Loop current at the far-end is monitored during ringing to enable the CO to disconnect the ringing generator when the phone is answered. The office continues to monitor the loop current at both ends of the connection throughout the call, to determine when the call is terminated by hanging up.

Signaling is a way to inform the CO what the customer wants. The two basic signaling methods used in customer loops are dial pulse and touch-tone. It is interesting to note that preferred customer loop signaling method in analog exchanges is digital, while the preferred method in digital exchanges is analog!

::'''MF Signaling Tones'''

:[[Image:DTMF_keypad.gif|thumb|right]]

Two tones are used to perform the signaling function to eliminate the possibility that speech be interpreted as a signal. At one time DTMF decoders were costly and bulky devices located in a common equipment bay, but today with the advent of LSI technology, this function can be performed on a chip. An example is the Mitel MT8865 DTMF filter, and MT8860 DTMF decoder.

Positions 11 to 14 are not presently being used.


:'''C - Coding'''
:[[Image:Companding_curves.gif|left|thumb]]

Telecommunications signals are seldom linearly encoded, but rather are companded (a combination of compression &amp; expansion). This allows for a more uniform S/N ratio over the entire range of signal sizes. Without companding, a 12 bit linear encoding scheme would be needed to obtain the same S/N ratio at low volume levels. It also reduces the noise and crosstalk levels at the receiver.

There are two principal international standards used to implement coding algorithms today: A-law, which is used in Europe, and µ-law, which is used in North America. These both involve 8 kHz sampling, and 8 bit A/D &amp; D/A conversion, thus resulting in 64 kbps digital bit streams. 

Although the actual compression algorithms are continuous functions, the codec approximates them by linear segments. A-law has 13 linear segments, and µ-law has 15 linear segments or cords.

:[[Image:Codec-segments.gif|right|thumb]]


Another important difference between the European and North American codecs, can be seen by the position of the decision threshold and its digital value.

:[[Image:Codec_steps.gif|left|thumb]]


When a telephone call is placed between Europe and North America, it is essential that all of these differences be accounted for. It is possible to regenerate the analog voice by passing it through the same type of codec that originally processed it, and then re-code with the other. An alternate approach is to use lookup tables that translate the binary values of one system to the other.

:[[Image:Simplified_codec.gif|right|thumb]]


Since the highest frequency passed is about 3.4 kHz, a great deal of ingenuity is required to pass data at 4.8, 9.6 kbps or even higher. Note that these are well above the Nyquist rate but considerably below the Shannon-Hartley limit.

All modern telephone systems today employ codecs in the BORSCHT interface to digitize the incoming analog signals. It is ironic that although the telephone system has been updated to digital technology, the telephone set and loop has remained analog.

By international agreement, all voice codecs use an 8 kHz sampling rate. Since each transmitted sample is 8 bits long, the analog voice signal is encoded into a 64 kbps binary steam. This rate determines the basic channel data rate of most other digital communications systems.

By bypassing the codec, it is possible to send 64 kbps customer data through the telephone system. However, because of old style signaling schemes still in use, digital data rates are often limited to 56 kbps.


:'''H - Hybrid'''

:[[Image:2-4_wire_hybrid.gif|left|thumb]] 

A diplexer performs a bi-directional 2-wire to 4-wire conversion. It allows two unidirectional electrical paths to be combined into a single bi-directional one, and vice versa. It is advantageous to separate transmit and receive portions of the signal since it is easier to make unidirectional amplifiers, filters, and logic devices.

One of the simplest ways to create an audio band hybrid is to use a transformer hybrid.

::'''Single Core Transformer Hybrid''' 

:[[Image:Single_core_hybrid.gif|right|thumb]]

There are several ways to split transmit and receive paths, the simplest method uses a single core hybrid transformer.

The basic defining transformer equations are:

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{{V_1 }}
{{n_1 }} = \frac{{V_2 }}
{{n_2 }} = \frac{{V_3 }}
{{n_3 }} =  \cdots \quad \quad \quad and\quad \quad \quad I_1 n_1  + I_2 n_2  + I_3 n_3  +  \cdots  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

For a single core hybrid with a center-tapped secondary, the impedance relationships for proper operation (conjugate matching) are:

::::&lt;math&gt;for\quad \quad \quad n_2  = n_3 \quad \quad \quad Z_2  = Z_3  = 2Z_4 \quad \quad \quad and\quad \quad \quad Z_1  = \left( {\frac{{n_2 }}
{{n_1 }}} \right)^2 Z_4 &lt;/math&gt;


:[[Image:Hybrid_operation.gif|left|thumb]] Note what happens if the transformer is driven from one of the secondary windings:

::::&lt;math&gt;let\quad \quad \quad n_1  = n_2  = n_3 \quad \quad \quad \therefore I_3  =  - I_1  - I_2 &lt;/math&gt;

::But ''I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' flow in the opposite directions, therefor:

::::&lt;math&gt;I_3  =  - \left( { - I} \right)_1  - I_2 \quad \quad \quad and\;if\quad \quad \quad \left| {I_1 } \right| = \left| {I_2 } \right|\quad \quad \quad then\quad \quad \quad I_3  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

This last requirement can be satisfied by adjusting the impedances Z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - Z&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to make the currents equal. From this we observe that signals injected into any port emerge only at adjacent ports but not at the opposite one.

:[[Image:THL.gif|right|thumb]]

In a properly balanced single core hybrid the typical throughput or insertion loss is about 3.5 dB and the THL (trans hybrid loss) is about 25 dB.

::'''Double Core Hybrid'''

:[[Image:Double_core_hybrid.gif|left|thumb]] 

When properly balanced, a 2-core network can achieve a THL of 50 dB while the insertion loss remains at about 3.5 dB. It has better performance than the single core device, but is bulkier and more expensive.

::'''Balancing Networks'''

All telecom equipment is tested and characterized against standard impedance terminations. These impedances are based on line surveys and are approximate equivalent circuit representations of the outside cabling plant. For this reason, these networks vary from country to country. In North America, IRL (input return loss) is measured against:

:'''T - Testing'''

In order to maintain a high degree of service (99.999%), the equipment must be capable of detecting and repairing faults before the customer is even aware that there may be a problem. As a result, a separate test buss and access relay is provided on a line interface. Tests may be performed in a bridged mode or with the loop and line card disconnected from each other.

Testing can be done in three basic directions:

::• From the line interface looking out towards the subscriber loop
::• From the loop connection looking into the line card
::• From the central office side of the line card

These tests are generally automated and are conducted late at night when there is little chance that the customer will request service, thus interrupting the test. Some of the scheduled tests may include:

::• Transmit and receive levels
::• Transmit and receive frequency response
::• Insertion loss
::• Trans-hybrid loss
::• Quantization distortion
::• Aliasing distortion

Some other tests that may be performed when commissioning a line or when a complaint is lodged, include:

::• Impulse noise test
::• C-message noise
::• Longitudinal balance

:'''Repeaters'''

:[[Image:2_wire_repeater.gif|right|thumb]]

By placing two hybrids back to back, it is possible to create a bidirectional amplifier or repeater. The total gain in the 4-wire path within the repeater must not exceed the combined transhybrid loss of the transformers. If this happens, the circuit will oscillate or sing.

The total gain in the 4-wire path within the repeater must not exceed the combined transhybrid loss of the transformers. If this happens, the circuit will oscillate or sing.


===Space Division Switching===

The physical path between any two customers on a space switch is not shared with anyone else. Crosspoints made from electromechanical relays have been used to perform the interconnection, but newer systems use semiconductors. 

In a crossbar matrix, the number of inputs and outputs do not have to be equal thus facilitating either concentration or expansion. In any case, a total of NxM crosspoints are required. Although only one contact is shown, many systems require two contacts if they keep the integrity of the tip and ring leads throughout the system.

:[[Image:Space_division_switch.gif|left|thumb]]


The folded matrix treats inputs and outputs identically and requires only ''N(N-1)/2'' crosspoints. The major disadvantage of this type of switch is the rapid increase of crosspoints as the system size increases. The number of crosspoints increases as ''N&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' and yet only a maximum of ''N'' crosspoints can be active at any given time. Failure of a single crosspoint prevents communication between the two devices sharing that crosspoint.


'''Multiple Stage Space Switch'''

One way to avoid the cost penalties associated with full matrices, is to organize the contacts into smaller groups. This impacts the call processing since the switch controller must manage several contacts per connection. Furthermore, the connection between any two subscribers may take any one of a number of paths, thus further complicating the decision making process.

The following sketch shows a simple three-stage space switch. It should be remembered that since a full duplex connection is required, a second switch supplying the return path must be provided.

:[[Image:3_stage_space_switch.gif|left|thumb]]


The total number of crosspoints in the above illustration is:

PLACE EQUATIONS HERE

The number of crosspoints required is dramatically reduced in this multiple stage switch in comparison to a square matrix. The central stage allows several ways to make a connection between two subscribers therefor, single crosspoint failures can be bypassed. This results in a more flexible and reliable system, but demands a more complex control structure.

'''Blocking'''

A non-blocking network is capable of finding a path between any idle input to any idle output. This does not mean that the system be able to handle simultaneously all customer requests for service. In such a case, the system may overload but the customer is not able to distinguish the difference between blocking and overload.

The following illustration shows how blocking can occur. The solid lines represent connections in service.

PLACE ILLUSTRATION HERE

The connections in service are not necessarily the optimum routing and may have been forced by the prior connections. Note that in this case, it is not possible for the last customer on switch 1:1 to contact the last customer on switch 1:3 because there is not a free center switching stage common to both. To overcome this, an additional center stage can be added. To prevent blocking, 2n-1 center arrays are necessary.

The total number of crosspoints (NoC) in a non-blocking network is therefore:

PLACE EQUATIONS HERE

As the total number of lines in increase, the total number of crosspoints can be approximated by: 

A non-blocking network of this type is known as a Clos switch, after its inventor. Its basic characteristics include:

::• Expansion in the first switching stage
::• An odd number of center stages
::• Concentration in the last stage

===Time Division Switching===

Time domain switching is simply an application of time domain multiplexing and may be performed on analog or digital signals. Any number of inputs may be sequentially routed to a single output.

:[[Image:TDM1.gif|left|thumb]]

This technique increases the transmission link utilization and can be modified to support circuit switching. If a multiplexer is placed at the input, a demultiplexer is placed at the output. This system can be used to multiplex either analog or digital signals.

:[[Image:TDM2.gif|left|thumb]]

Each customer is assigned a unique switch, but all customers share the same internal signal path. For N customers there are 2N switches. TDM bus switching occurs when the input sequence is not the same as the output sequence. 

Each customer is given access to the common structure for a brief moment. If higher data rates are needed, multiple inputs can be assigned, thus giving the customer more time to transmit a signal.

'''Time Slot Interchange [TSI]'''

If information can be arranged into a sequence, it can also be rearranged, much like shuffling a deck of cards. This is the task of the time slot interchange unit. Full duplex operation is achieved by interchanging time slots in both directions.

:[[Image:TSI.gif|left|thumb]]


The incoming TDM channels are mapped sequentially into RAM while the outgoing channels are read out non-sequentially. This output address generator is simply a memory-mapped pointer governed by a central controller.

The required memory access time can be approximated as the inverse of the channel rate. The RAM width is determined by the number of bits in a channel, and the length by the number of channels in a frame.

'''Time Multiplexed Switching'''

Combining TDM and TSI allows a channel from one digital bit stream to be switched to any channel on another digital bit stream. A multistage time switch can consist of cascaded switching modules. To prevent blocking, 3 or more stages are required.

:[[Image:TMS_switch.gif|left|thumb]]


Although it appears that only time domain switching is used in this example, it is also known as a Time-Space-Time switch or simply ''TST''. This is because the center stage is actually switching different input lines in space to a common output line. Since there is an ambiguity in the terminology, some manufacturers of telecommunications equipment may refer to this as a ''TTT'' switch if all of the signals are digital.

For small-scale switches, space switching is most efficient. However, as switch size increases, time domain switching tends to gain the advantage.

It is sometimes difficult to make direct comparisons between various telecommunications switches because the internal architectures may be quite different. However, it is possible to compare BHCA (busy hour call attempts) capacity or performance such as traffic intensity, under a specified set of circumstances. 

Traffic Intensity is the product of average holding time and the calling rate and is expressed in CCS (hundred call seconds) or Erlangs.

CCS is defined as: (number of calls per hour)x(call holding time in seconds)/100seconds
Therefore, 36 CCS = 1 Erlang

An erlang is a measure of the traffic intensity and is equal to the average number of simultaneous calls at any given moment. It represents the total circuit usage during any time interval, divided by that interval. It also corresponds to the minimum number of channels necessary to carry the traffic, if it could be scheduled.

'''Example'''

::Imagine for a moment that there are 8 customers in a small telephone system making random calls:

:[[Image:Erlang_example_a.gif|left|thumb]]

::These calls could conceivably be arranged as: [[Image:Erlang_example_b.gif|thumb]]

Three, 1 hour channels could carry this traffic and still have 25 minutes left over
to spare. The traffic intensity is therefor less than 3 Erlangs:

Complex analysis maintains a position of key importance in the study of physical phenomena. The importance of the theory of complex variables is seen particularly in quantum mechanics, for complex analysis is just a useful tool in classical mechanics but is central to the various peculiarities of quantum physics.

==Complex functions==
A function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a '''complex function'''. 
===Continuity===
Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a complex function. Let &lt;math&gt;a\in\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''continuous''' at &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|z-a|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;|f(z)-f(a)|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
===Differentiablity===
Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a complex function and let &lt;math&gt;a\in\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to be differentiable at &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists &lt;math&gt;L\in\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\lim_{z\to a}\frac{f(z)-f(a)}{z-a}=L&lt;/math&gt;
==Analyticity==
It is a miracle of complex analysis that if a complex function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at every point in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, then it is &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times differentiable for every &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, further, it can be represented as te sum of a power series, i.e. 

for every &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; there exist &lt;math&gt;a_0,a_1a_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;|z-z_0|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f(z)=a_0+a_1(z-z_0)+a_2(z-z_0)^2+\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

Such functions are called '''analytic''' functions or '''holomorphic''' functions. 
==Path integration==
A finite path in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the continuous function &lt;math&gt;\Gamma:[0,1]\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function, the integral of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; along the path &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is defined as 

&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 f(\Gamma (x))dx&lt;/math&gt;, which is an ordinary Riemann integral

== [[:Category:Colors]] ==

Please do not add pages to categories as though this were Wikipedia.  [[:Category:Colors]] is for the book [[Colors]] and not for any subpages that belong to other books.

:Could we rename it for example as [[:Category:Colors (book)]] because of the interwiki reason: an absence of category links must engender some redundancies between WB and WV as it happened on the French ones? [[User:JackPotte|JackPotte]] ([[User talk:JackPotte|talk]]) 15:18, 29 July 2010 (UTC)

::The categories that would be appropriate for interwiki links (other than for translations of the same book) would be the categories with the same names as the subject pages used for browsing books.  So, for instance, [[:Category:French language]] and not [[:Category:French]]. You can view the entire tree from [[Subject:Books by subject]].  I also forgot to clarify how the categories are used at Wikibooks, in that [[Using Wikibooks/Subjects, Categories, and Classifications]] provides information on that. This system is why we don't approve interwiki bots, because it has to be done by hand by those familiar with the system in place here.  &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:20, 29 July 2010 (UTC)

== Please participate ==
Hope you wouldn't mind participating on the &quot;vote&quot; to restore the [[Wikibooks:Administrators#Becoming_a_CheckUser|CheckUser (CU) function]] (mostly used to fight vandalism) to the Wikibooks project, a &lt;u&gt;minimum of 25 expressions of support is required&lt;/u&gt; to grant the flag to administrator Thenub314 (this will also enable admin Adrignola to get the function active again, since there is a minimum requirement of 2 active Wikibookians with the flag). In case you do agree to participate, your vote needs to be added to [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_permissions#Thenub314.C2.A0.28talk.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0email.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0contribs.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0logs.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0rights.29_.28CheckUser.29|administrator Thenub314 request for permission]].

== About fr.wikt ==

I don't agree with the two oppose votes; vandalism is a problem we have to face anyways, and it's always better to have two CUs than none, especially since an indef block for sockpuppetry cannot be justified without sufficient evidence and evidence can be obtained from CheckUser. I'd love to support you but the page on wikt seems to be protected... and I still need to brush up on my French before I comment there. Vous savez, je ne parle pas le français très bien...

As for the Category:Colors comment above, why are you adding Category:Alphabets to all those pages? This isn't Wikipedia and categories are not used this way. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:54, 26 July 2012 (UTC)

::Categories are used to link together the chapters of books, not to link together unrelated books. Categories are definitely never used to link individual pages within books to other pages in unrelated books - that is what Wikipedia does, it is not done here. You say you couldn't think of a better way of listing them, but they don't need listing. Where's the value of (to use a paper book analogy)  creating a list that says &quot;page 16 of this book has some stuff about alphabets and so does page 234 of this other book&quot;? What is done is to link whole books together - this is done with Subjects. The approach would be to create a Subject of &quot;Alphabets&quot; and add the root page of each book to that Subject. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:31, 26 July 2012 (UTC)
:::I was going to revert all of this but decided not to - I think if you want to continue with this approach you should start a discussion in the Reading Room on whether it is appropriate or not. Whenever it has been done before it has been reverted by other editors but maybe it is worth a discussion first. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:37, 26 July 2012 (UTC)

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

===Geostationary Orbit===

A satellite which orbits around the earth at the same rate that the earth turns is known as a synchronous orbit. Synchronous orbits can be of any inclination. If they are polar orbiting, the satellite will appear to be over the same spot at the same time every day.

Remote sensing satellites can be place in orbits that are synchronous with the earth’s rotation over a longer period than a day, and thus will be able to view the entire ground surface over a number of orbits.

If a geosynchronous orbit is placed over the equator, something very interesting happens. The satellite will appear to stop moving in the sky. This is referred to as a geostationary orbit.

The gravitational acceleration of an object as a function of altitude is:

::::&lt;math&gt;a_{c}=\left( \frac{r_{e}}{r_{s}} \right)^{2}g&lt;/math&gt;

::where:

::::&lt;math&gt;r_{e}=&lt;/math&gt; equatorial radius of the earth (6378.388 km)

::::&lt;math&gt;r_{s}=&lt;/math&gt; radius at the satellite position

::::&lt;math&gt;g=&lt;/math&gt; earth's gravitational constant (9.80665 m/sec&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)


The centrifugal acceleration on a satellite is given by:

::::&lt;math&gt;a_{c}=r_{s}\omega ^{2}=r_{s}\left( \frac{2\pi }{T_{s}} \right)^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

::where:

::::&lt;math&gt;\omega =&lt;/math&gt; angular velocity in radians/sec

::::&lt;math&gt;T_{s}=&lt;/math&gt; time for 1 orbit (86400 seconds [24 hrs] for geostationary orbit)


For a stable orbit, the two forces associated with these accelerations must be equal

::::&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{r_{e}}{r_{s}} \right)^{2}g=r_{s}\left( \frac{2\pi }{T_{s}} \right)^{2}&lt;/math&gt;


[[Image:Geostationary_plot.gif|left|thumb]]


Solving for ''r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' we obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt;r_{s}=\sqrt[3]{\left( \frac{r_{e}T_{s}}{2\pi } \right)^{2}g}=\sqrt[{}]{\left( \frac{6378\ km\times 86400\ \sec }{2\pi } \right)^{2}9.8065\ m/\sec ^{2}}=42,254.22\ km&lt;/math&gt;

Therefor the height above the earth is 42,254 km - 6378 km = 35,876 km or 22,292 miles.

The velocity of a satellite in a circular orbit is given by:

This works out to 3.073 km/Sec for a satellite in a geostationary orbit.

====Path Length====

The transmission path length can be found by applying Pythagorean Theorem:

In actual practice, the angle of elevation must be at least 5 degrees above the horizon. Therefore the actual geometry is closer to:

By applying the law of sines, a better approximation of the maximum path length can be determined, as well as the minimum distance from the pole required to see the satellite.

Using the polar radius to calculate the total arc length of the earth, with the polar curvature, we obtain an effective polar circumference of:

Which means that the minimum distance d from the pole, at which the satellite can be seen is:

It is evident from the sketch, that the further north one goes, the greater the signal path length through the atmosphere.

===Molniya Orbit===

The former USSR is not able to make great use of geostationary satellites, because of the northern latitude of the country. Consequently, communications satellites have required a slightly different approach. The term molniya means “flash of lightning”.

{{Wikipedia|Molniya_orbit}}

===Sun Synchronous Orbit===

{{Wikipedia|Sun-synchronous orbit}}

Many satellites which require sunlight for imaging use sun-synchronous orbits. The sun-synchronous orbit provides a constant node-to-sun angle, and the satellite passage over a certain area occurs at the same time of the day.</text>

==Carrier Grade Packet Networks==

In most data applications, user data is decomposed into a string of packets. This requires that additional information be added to the user’s data to ensure its safe arrival at the correct destination.

If the packets are rather long or of variable length, the system may be referred to as frame relay. If the packets are small and of fixed length, the system may be referred to as cell relay.


The user data may be organized into fixed or variable length packets depending on the type of system. In any case, additional information is appended to the customers data in the form of a header.

Some of the header contents may include:
:• Source address
:• Destination address
:• Time stamp or packet sequence number
:• Maximum allowable delay (priority)
:• ACK/NACK
:• Network control/billing
:• Error checking etc.

However, simplex connections with transmission delays are not suitable for voice connections, but are not a concern in data transmission. Each input data packet is stored in an input buffer or queue and sent to the appropriate output queue when resources become available. If the packets and queues are sufficiently short, a virtual full duplex link may be established, and interactive transactions may be possible.

In order to understand the operation of these systems, it is often necessary to resort to a standard reference model. The OSI model outlines the various functions and attributes, which are inherent in any communications system.

{{wikipedia|OSI_model}}

A further necessity is the standardization of the implementation of the OSI model. This work has largely been done by the IEEE and ITU (formerly CCITT).

The OSI model was started in 1978 and has evolved to provide a framework for interoperability. Standardization is required in order that various types of equipment or systems can be joined in some useful way. Some of the activities, which are regulated, include:
•   Interprocess communications
•   Data representation
•   Data storage
•   Resource and process management
•   Security
•   Program support

The majority of the OSI model is implemented in microprocessor based hardware. This means that new applications, network architectures, and protocols can generally be accommodated by making software changes. It also means that the traditional gap between the telecommunications and computer industry is being reduced.

Significant advances have been made in the physical layer interfaces, as networks migrate from twisted pair cabling to fiber optics. These developments have introduced new applications, architectures and protocols.

Some applications for public data packet networks include:
:•   Electronic funds transfer: Banks, Automated tellers, Clearinghouses, Stock exchanges
:•   Point-of-sale terminals
:•   Credit card verification
:•   Electronic mail
:•   Electronic purchasing
:•   Inventory management
:•   Database interworking

==The Internet==

==LANs==

{{Wikipedia|Local_area_network}}

LANs are used to connect a group of terminals or workstations together. These may be found in a relatively confined space such as within a building or campus setting. The attachments may be dumb or intelligent terminals, file servers, routers, and repeaters.

The majority of LANs are privately owned. They can be connected to the PSTN or some other carrier to form MANs or WANs.

LANs can be categorized in a number of ways. One method examines how information is placed on the interconnecting transmission medium. Baseband LANs directly inject logic levels of on the medium and share access by some form of TDM. Broadband LANs however, use high frequency carriers and share access by FDM.

Some authors prefer to segregate a special category, the PBX:
:LAN - local area network (baseband)
:HSLN - high-speed local network (may be baseband or broadband)
:PBX - private branch exchange (baseband)

The most widely used LANs today are ethernet, token ring, token bus, and  Appletalk. They can be interconnected by gateways, routers, bridges, or repeaters to form MANs, which can in turn be used to create  WANs.
'''
Topology'''

[[Image:LAN_topology.gif|left|thumb]]

LANs can be configured in three basic ways, namely: as a ring, star, or bus. Another arrangement known as a tree topology is really a variation of the bus. Cable TV is an example of a tree network employing frequency division multiplexing.

:'''Star'''

The end office of the PSTN is configured as a star where all lines radiate from a single location. This type of wiring is also used in all modern office buildings. This center of the star or hub may contain a network manager of some other piece of hardware that exercises control over the LAN. This type of arrangement is used in a PBX, and the most common connection media is a twisted pair of wires.

Some networks may be configured as a physical star, but may have a different logical topology, such as a ring.


:'''Ring'''

A ring consists of a closed loop, where each station is connected by an active or passive tap. An active tap is one has electronic components inserted into the loop to both extract and inject signals, thus all stations are effectively connected in series. A passive tap simply comes in contact with the loop., thus all stations are effectively connected in parallel.

A station wanting to transmit waits its turn to inject a packet onto the ring. This implies some sort of distributed protocol. This is most often implemented by means of a token.

:'''Bus'''

A distributed protocol arrangement or token is needed to resolve bus contention problems. Each terminal monitors the common bus for any data with their address appended, at which point it simply makes a copy. This arrangement is often found in computer systems where a number of peripheral devices may be connected on a high-speed bus.

Two important issues in this type of arrangement are access and signal level. In a baseband or digital environment, there is often a polling mechanism imposed to create order. Also, the signals degenerate as they propagate down the line, this means that some sort of compensation must be made.

RS-422 is a simple protocol that is implemented on a twisted wire bus. The system allows a couple of dozen devices to be networked as far as 1 km, with a data rate of up to 1 Mbps.

Ethernet is an example of a baseband system implemented on a bus.

==Cellular Voice Networks==

{{Wikipedia|Cellular_network}}

Mobile radio service was introduced in St. Louis in 1946. This radio dispatching system had an operator who patched the caller to the PSTN. Later, IMTS allowed customers to dial their calls without an operator. From this humble beginning came the present cellular phone system.

The cellular network is viewed by the PSTN as just another end-office where calls originate and terminate.

::::[[Image:PSTN_MSC_cloud.gif]]

The STP (signal transfer point) handles the network routing by establishing the route to the HLR (home location register) for a specific mobile user. This simplifies network management, because only the routing tables in the STP need to be updated as the system grows. Each MSC (mobile switching center) does not have to maintain full routing tables to all other MSCs.

'''Cellular Voice Reference Model'''

:[[Image:Cellular_voice_reference_model.gif|left|thumb]]

::AC — Authentication Center. This manages the authentication of the end user or equipment on behalf of the MS. It may serve many HLRs or in fact be an HLR itself.
::BS — Base Station. The base station manages one or more cell sites and consists of a controller and one or more radio transceivers.
::EIR — Equipment Identity Register. This is not presently well defined, but is used to identify end user equipment and reduce the incidents of fraud.
::HLR — Home Location Register. This identifies the particular user and their service profile. It also records their current location and authorization period. The HLR may be distributed over more than one entity.
::MS — Mobile Station. This is the actual radio based terminal that provides customer access to the network.
::MSC — Mobile Switching Center. The telecommunications switch which routes calls between mobile users and the PSTN.
::VLR — Visitor Location Register. This allows visitors to roam on other systems.

This reference model distinguishes between various tasks and does not necessarily reflect the actual physical equipment.

Unfortunately, there is a wide range of incompatible technologies being used at the Um air interface. Consequently, although it is possible to communicate with people all over the world, it is not possible to take your phone with you everywhere. This makes it difficult to adapt the present system to support global PCS.

The cellular infrastructure market is dominated by four major corporations: Lucent Technologies, Nortel, Ericsson, and Motorola.

The current cellular system is experiencing unprecedented growth in subscribers, services, and technological innovation. Some of the offered services include:
::•   Paging, vehicle location
::•   Text, data, facsimile transmission
::•   Traffic, weather information
::•   Emergency aid dialing
::•   Electronic funds transfer for fare payment

There are however, some areas of concern:
::•   Computerized call hand-offs between cell sites
::•   Caller identification
::•   Remote diagnostics
::•   Reliability
::•   Technology mix [digital, analog, UHF, audio, computer]
::•   Billing
::•   Long distance paging

Each subscriber is assigned transmit and receive frequencies for the duration of a call. The frequency pair is sometimes referred to as the forward and reverse channels, or the up and down link. Under control from the cell site, the cellular phone must be able to tune to any of the hundreds of frequency channels in the system.

Some of the adjacent cells will monitor the signal strength from the portable unit in order to help the central exchange to determine which cell site should handle the call. If at some time, this signal becomes weaker because the customer has moved into another cell service area, a call hand–off will be necessary. This requires that the cellular phone switch to another set of frequencies, and the calling path be rerouted. All of this must appear transparent to the user.


===AMPS===

 {{Wikipedia|Advanced_Mobile_Phone_System}}

AMPS is an analog system based on FDMA and used extensively in North America. It has been slightly modified since its inception and some of its characteristics are:
::•   Channel width:     30 KHz
::•   Duplex spacing:    45 MHz
::•   Data transmission: BFSK ±8 KHz deviation
::•   Output power:      0.6 to 4 watts

The present system divides the 832 channels into two blocks of 416 channels. Within each block, 21 channels are reserved for signaling.

Some of the weaknesses associated with this system include:
::•   Call blocking during busy hours in urban areas
::•   Misconnects and disconnects due to rapidly fading signals
::•   Lack of privacy and security
::•   Limited data transmission [1200 bps]

One technique, which has been put forward to resolve some of the congestion problem now found in the major urban areas, is to narrow the channel broadcast bandwidth. NAMPS(narrow AMPS) increases system capacity by splitting each 30 kHz AMPS channel into three 10 kHz channels. This is seen as an interim solution until a better scheme is agreed upon.

'''Cell Channel Allocation'''

::[[Image:Amps_cell_group.gif|left|thumb]]

It is not possible to assign all channels to each cell since adjacent cells using the same frequencies would interfere with each other. The channel distribution in the 832-channel system is as follows:
::•   A cell group of 7 adjacent cells share 416 full duplex channels
::•   No cell contains any adjacent frequency channels
::•   4 cells are assigned 56 channels
::•   3 cells are assigned 57 channels
::•   21 channels are reserved for control

Frequency utilization can be improved by cell splitting and sectoring. These approaches effectively reduce the size of the customer service area and allow frequencies reuse. This increases the number of hand-offs and other demands on the MTX.

::[[Image:Cell_spliting.gif|left|thumb]]

Cell splitting involves the creation of a new smaller cell from two larger ones, while sectoring is the breakup of a single cell into smaller ones. Typically, cell sites are split 3 or 4 to 1.

To minimize spill over into nearby cells, the cell antennas are given a slight downward tilt, and the output power is limited to 100 Werp.

Another way to increase utilization is by channel borrowing. A few channels are allowed to violate the normal frequency assignments and move between cells. This allows the system to dynamically vary the number of customers that can be served in a given cell. Careful consideration must be given to potential co-channel interference

This principle can be further extended to provide dynamic channel assignment, where the assigned cell frequencies are continually changing to meet the shifting demand patterns.

===GSM=== 

{{Wikipedia| Global_System_for_Mobile_Communications}}

GSM is a third generation wireless telephone technology that allows roaming in 17 European countries. It started off as a pan-European standard but quickly gained world wide acceptance for its comprehensive and thoughtful implementation.

GSM uses a TDMA access format and has a call hand-off capability, thus increasing customer mobility and allowing inbound calls. Base stations can handle 124 frequency bands. Channel 0 is performs a dual role of providing a signaling channel and monitoring signal strength. All other channels can be assigned to subscribers.

::• Up Link Frequency   890 - 915 MHz
::• Down Link Frequency 935 - 960 MHz
::• Carrier Spacing     200 KHz
::• Can support 1000 speech or data channels
::• Uses GMSK† modulation

{{Wikipedia|Microwave_radio_relay}}

Microwaves are high frequency radio waves (&gt; 1GHz) and they propagate much like any other electromagnetic phenomenon in free space. Because they are electromagnetic waves and not electrons, they do not propagate well down copper cables. instead, the waves are guided down hollow conductors.

===Waveguides===

{{wikipedia|Waveguide_(electromagnetism)}}

Two boundary conditions must be met in a waveguide for a wave to travel down the guide:

:• The electric field must terminate normally on the conductor (the tangential component of the electric field must be zero).
:• The magnetic field must lie entirely tangent along the wall surface. (the normal component of the magnetic field must be zero).

Consequently, TEM waves cannot be conducted in a waveguide. (Recall that in a TEM wave, the electric and magnetic fields are at right angles to each other and the direction of propagation.) 

The most common wave used in waveguides is the TE&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, meaning transverse electric. The subscript TE&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the number of half cycles which appear in the ''a'' and ''b'' dimensions of the waveguide.

:[[Image:Waveguide.gif|left|thumb]]


There are many other waveguide modes. A TE&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; wave may be formed when two TEM wave intersect:

:[[Image:TE10a.gif|left|thumb]]

:[[Image:TE10b.gif|left|thumb]]

::The velocity of a TEM wave in air is: &lt;math&gt;c=\lambda f&lt;/math&gt;

::The phase velocity (the apparent wave velocity along the guide wall) of a TE wave:  &lt;math&gt;v_{p}=\lambda _{g}f&lt;/math&gt;

::Therefor the phase or guide velocity is: &lt;math&gt;v_{p}=\frac{\lambda _{g}}{\lambda }c&lt;/math&gt;

::From the right angle triangle BCD, we obtain: &lt;math&gt;\cos \alpha =\frac{\lambda }{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

::From the right angle triangle ABD we obtain: &lt;math&gt;\sin \alpha =\frac{\lambda }{\lambda _{g}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since

::&lt;math&gt;\text{sin}^{2}\alpha \text{ + cos}^{2}\alpha \text{ = 1}&lt;/math&gt;

::We obtain:   
::::&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\lambda }{\lambda _{g}} \right)^{2}+\left( \frac{\lambda }{2a} \right)^{2}=1&lt;/math&gt; 

::or  
::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\lambda _{g}^{2}}=\frac{1}{\lambda ^{2}}-\frac{1}{\left( 2a \right)^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

::where
::::&lt;math&gt;\lambda _{g}=&lt;/math&gt; guide wavelength for the TE&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; mode
::::&lt;math&gt;\lambda =&lt;/math&gt; free space wavelength of the TEM wave
::::&lt;math&gt;a=&lt;/math&gt; broad dimension of the waveguide

When &lt;math&gt;\lambda =2a&lt;/math&gt;, the guide wavelength becomes infinite. This corresponds to a TEM wave bouncing from side to side in the guide with no velocity component along the guide. This is cutoff wavelength &lt;math&gt;\left( \lambda _{c} \right)&lt;/math&gt;and represents the lowest frequency that can be propagated.

'''Phase &amp; Group Velocity'''

{{wikipedia|Group_velocity}}

{{wikipedia| Phase_velocity}}

:[[Image:TE10c.gif|left|thumb]]

The equations above can be manipulated to obtain:

::::&lt;math&gt;\lambda _{g}=\frac{\lambda }{\sqrt{1-\left( \frac{\lambda }{\lambda _{c}} \right)^{2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the phase velocity is always greater than the speed of light. The TEM components zigzag through the guide at the speed of light, but they convey power at the group velocity. The group velocity is always less than the speed of light.


'''Analogy'''

Nothing physical can exceed the speed of light, but it is possible for some aspect of a wave to exceed light speed.  For example, the splash that occurs when a wave washes up on the beach can travel faster than the wave, if it strikes at some angle other than 90&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;.

:[[Image:splash.gif|left|thumb]]

:'''Example'''
:A rectangular waveguide measuring 0.9 by 0.45 inches is fed with a 10 GHz carrier. Determine if a TE&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; wave will propagate, and if so, determine its guide wavelength, group velocity and phase velocity.

::::&lt;math&gt;a=0.9\ \text{in}\text{.}\ =2.28\ cm&lt;/math&gt;


::::&lt;math&gt;\lambda _{c}=2\times 2.28=4.58\ cm&lt;/math&gt;


::::&lt;math&gt;\lambda =\frac{3\times 10^{8}}{10^{10}}=3\ cm&lt;/math&gt;


:Since  &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;\lambda _{c}&lt;/math&gt;, a TE&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; wave will propagate.

::::&lt;math&gt;\lambda _{g}=\frac{\lambda }{\sqrt{1-\left( \frac{\lambda }{\lambda _{c}} \right)^{2}}}=\frac{3}{\sqrt{1-\left( \frac{3}{4.58} \right)^{2}}}=3.97\ cm&lt;/math&gt;


::::&lt;math&gt;v_{p}=c\frac{\lambda _{g}}{\lambda }=3\times 10^{8}\frac{3.97}{3}=4.4\times 10^{8}\ m/\sec &lt;/math&gt;


::::&lt;math&gt;v_{g}=c\frac{\lambda }{\lambda _{g}}=3\times 10^{8}\frac{3}{3.97}=2.27\times 10^{8}\ m/\sec &lt;/math&gt;


====Wave Impedance====

{{wikipedia|Wave_impedance}}


The ratio of the transverse electric and magnetic fields constitutes an impedance. This should not be considered the same as a resistance, because it does not dissipate power. 

The TE&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; wave consists of two equal TEM waves where the electric field is transverse along the ''b'' dimension but the magnetic field is along the a dimension is described by: &lt;math&gt;H_{a}=H\sin \alpha &lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, the wave impedance is:

::::&lt;math&gt;Z_{w}=\frac{E_{b}}{H_{a}}=\frac{E}{H\sin \alpha }&lt;/math&gt;

:For a TEM wave:  &lt;math&gt;\frac{E}{H}=120\pi &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

::::&lt;math&gt;Z_{w}=\frac{120\pi }{\sin \alpha }=120\pi \frac{\lambda _{g}}{\lambda }\quad \Omega &lt;/math&gt;

:or

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{120\pi }{\sqrt{1-\left( \frac{\lambda }{\lambda _{c}} \right)^{2}}}&lt;/math&gt; for TE waves.

::::&lt;math&gt;120\pi \sqrt{1-\left( \frac{\lambda }{\lambda _{c}} \right)^{2}}&lt;/math&gt; for TM waves.

A TE wave has a characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;\Omega &gt;120\pi &lt;/math&gt;. As the cutoff frequency is approached, the impedance approaches infinity. These modes are generated by means of a vertical probe antenna.

A TM wave has a characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;\Omega &lt;120\pi &lt;/math&gt;. As the cutoff frequency is approached, the impedance approaches zero. These modes are generated by means of a horizontal probe antenna.

A waveguide with a dielectric other than air will have its cutoff wavelength increased by the square root of the dielectric constant.

Waveguide attenuation characteristics are quite complex and are generally derived empirically. Attenuation varies with interior wall coating, guide dimensions, and operating frequency Attenuation can occur because the induced wall currents are electrons interacting with the guide.

There is a limit to the amount of power which can be conveyed in a guide. If this limit is exceeded, electrical arcing will occur and severe attenuation results. The maximum power handling capability of an air filled rectangular waveguide operating in the TE mode is:

::::&lt;math&gt;P_{\max }=6.63\times 10^{-4}E_{\max }^{2}ab\frac{\lambda }{\lambda _{g}}&lt;/math&gt;

:where ''E&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;'' = maximum voltage gradient in v/cm

====Standing Waves====

{{Wikipedia|Standing_wave}}

Standing waves act much like the plucked string on a guitar. The signal magnitude changes but its location does not. One of the most useful places to create a standing wave is at a radiating antenna, but it may also be useful to create one in a guide.

::[[Image:Standing_waves.gif|left|thumb]]

'''Wall Currents'''

Traveling waves are time invariant. The pattern appears to keep its shape as it moves down the guide. However, as they propagate down the line, they induce currents in the guide walls, at right angles to the magnetic field.

::[[Image:Wall_currents.gif|left|thumb]]


Slots that do not noticeably interrupt wall current, do not radiate.

====Microwave Components====

'''Coupling Energy into a Waveguide'''

Probe or capacitive coupling acts like a 1/4&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; Marconi antenna. The probe, which might be the center conductor of a coaxial cable, is positioned 1/4 &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; from the end of the guide. Since a total inversion occurs when the wave reflects, it adds in phase with the coupled signal.

::[[Image:Microwave_probe.gif|left|thumb]]


The probe can be tapered to handle wideband signals. TE modes are generated if the probe is placed in the wide dimension of the guide, while TM modes are produced when the probe is placed in the narrow sidewall.

Loop or magnetic coupling creates magnetic fields that are launched from the antenna. The loop may be placed anywhere the magnetic field exists.

::[[Image:Loop_coupling.gif|left|thumb]]


Aperture or slot coupling occurs when a slot is cut in the maximum of the electric or magnetic field area

'''Bends &amp; Twists'''

::[[Image:Bends_twists.gif|left|thumb]]

The twist section is used to change between horizontal and vertical polarization.

'''Tees'''

::[[Image:Tees.gif|left|thumb]]

Shunt tee - The signal at port C is the vector sum of ports A and B if they are used as inputs. If port C is used as the input, the power is evenly split between A and B.

Series Tee - Using the top port as the input, the power will b evenly split between A and B however, they will be anti phase.

Hybrid Tee - If A and B are used as the inputs, port C will be the vector sum and port D will be the vector difference. If C is the input, the energy will be evenly split between A and B. This device is often used to connect a transmitter and receiver to the same antenna. The antenna is at port B, the transmitter at C, the receiver at D, and a matched load at A.

'''Tuners'''

::[[Image:Tuners.gif|left|thumb]]

If the reactive stub is &lt; 1/4&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in the waveguide, it acts like a capacitor. If it is &gt; 1/4&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in the waveguide, it acts like an inductor. If it is 1/4&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in the waveguide, it acts like an LC resonant circuit where the Q is proportional to the post diameter.

Tuning is sometimes done to minimize the amount of signal reflected from a waveguide component. This has a significant effect on the reflection coefficient and VSWR (voltage standing wave ratio). The effect of these things can be plotted and observed on a Smith Chart.


'''Terminators'''

All of the energy travelling down a waveguide must be absorbed in order to prevent reflections. This is accomplished by placing a resistor in the center of the guide where the electric field intensity is the greatest.

::[[Image:Resistive_terminator.gif|left|thumb]]

A short circuit is used if reflections are required.

A variable attenuator can be constructed by repositioning the absorbing material in the electric field.


'''Directional Couplers'''

::[[Image:Directional_coupler.gif|left|thumb]]

====Microwave Cavities====

The dimensions of a microwave cavity must be some multiple of 1/2 l, and the Q may be as high as 100,000.

::::&lt;math&gt;Q=\frac{\text{cavity}\ \text{volume}}{\text{interior}\ \text{area}}&lt;/math&gt;


Energy is coupled into the cavity by means of a probe, loop, slot, or electron beam.

Conventional tubes have constant velocity beams and vary the number of electrons emitted to modulate the beam intensity. Microwave tubes emit a constant stream of electrons and vary their velocity to modulate the beam intensity.

'''Two Cavity Klystron'''

{{wikipedia|Klystron}}

An electron beam is created at the cathode and passed by the buncher cavity. The RF energy coupled into the cavity causes the beam velocity to vary, thus causing the electrons to bunch. Energy is coupled to the catcher cavity when the beam passes its port. The net result is that the RF energy may be amplified by a factor of 1000.

::[[Image:Two_cavity_klystron.gif|left|thumb]]


The klystron acts as a high Q narrowband amplifier. It may have more bunching cavities to increase the gain or the cavities may be staggered tuned to increase the bandwidth.

'''Reflex Klystron'''

The reflex klystron has a single cavity that acts as both buncher and catcher. The beam is passed by the cavity, bunched, repelled and passed by the cavity a second time, and the absorbed in the sidewalls. It is necessary to turn on the repeller voltage prior to turning on the anode supply, otherwise the tube will self-destruct.

The reflex klystron is used as a low power, low efficiency, variable frequency oscillator. The operating frequency is adjusted by changing the cavity volume.

'''Magnetron'''

The magnetron is a high power microwave oscillator that has found widespread use in radar, radio beacon, and microwave oven applications.

The cylindrical cathode is surrounded by the anode, which has several resonant cavities. The entire assembly is placed in an intense right magnetic field running parallel to the cathode axis. This field causes an electron emitted from the cathode to follow a curved path on its way to the anode. However, the electron passes cavities on the route and so looses energy, causing it to fall back towards the cathode. The cathode repels the falling electron forcing it back towards the anode. This process continues ad infinitum. Electron bunching occurs each time the beam passes a cavity.

::[[Image:Magnetron.gif|left|thumb]]

{{wikipedia|Cavity_magnetron}}

The critical magnetic field is that which allows the electron to just graze the anode. If the field intensity falls below this value, oscillation will cease. The dominant or π mode occurs when the polarity on adjacent poles is 180o apart. This causes the phase focusing effect where electrons are bunched in adjacent cavities. The beam shift around the interior is some integer multiple of the wavelength.

To prevent the bunched electrons to skip some cavities thus creating spurious modes, every second pole is strapped together. The output is taken from one of the cavities via a probe antenna. The magnetron can be mechanically tuned by about 5%.

The continuous power output can be as high as 25 kW, but with low duty cycle pulsing [.001] the peak output can be in the mega watt range.


'''TWT'''

{{wikipedia|Traveling-wave tube}}

Traveling wave tubes have a higher bandwidth but lower Q than klystrons. The RF signal traveling a helical path around the beam causes the beam to bunch. This in turn reinforces the RF signal causing amplification.

It can be used as a low power [30 mW], low noise amplifier with about a bandwidth of about one octave. Medium power devices operate at about 25 watts. High-powered devices can be pulsed at about 100 kW.

TWTs are used as broadband amplifiers and repeaters in TV, radar and satellite applications. It may be frequency or amplitude modulated.

====Microwave Semiconductors====

'''Gunn Diodes'''

{{wikipedia|Gunn_diode}}

The Gunn diode is not a diode in the truest sense because it does not contain a semiconductor junction. It is simply a piece of N-type gallium arsenide. 

Normally the mobility of electrons increases as the electric field increases in a semiconductor. In this device, there is a range where the mobility of the electrons actually decreases as the electric field increases. Essentially the current falls as the voltage rises. This means that for a narrow range, the device exhibits a negative resistance. This is a very unstable situation and the device has a tendency to oscillate when biased in this region. The actual frequency of oscillation is dependant on the physical size of the semiconductor and occurs when the electron transit time is equal to one oscillation period.

'''Pin Diodes'''

{{wikipedia|Pin_diode}}

PIN diodes are used as high frequency switches. The have very little junction capacitance and a very low forward voltage drop.

====Microwave Measurements====

Reflections in a waveguide are undesirable. They send power back to the source, which may ultimately damage the signal source, and they create standing waves.

'''Standing Waves'''

{{wikipedia|Standing_wave}}

If waves are allowed to reflect from a microwave device, the incident and reflected waves will interact to create a standing wave. This is somewhat similar to the vibration of a stringed instrument.

The reflection coefficient is defined as the ratio of the reflected and incident voltage.

::::&lt;math&gt;\Gamma =\frac{E_{r}}{E_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;

The ratio of maximum to minimum voltage of a standing wave is known as the VSWR (voltage standing wave ratio).

::::&lt;math&gt;VSWR=\frac{\left| E_{i} \right|+\left| E_{r} \right|}{\left| E_{i} \right|-\left| E_{r} \right|}=\frac{E_{\max }}{E_{\min }}=\frac{1+\left| \Gamma  \right|}{1-\left| \Gamma  \right|}&lt;/math&gt;

To eliminate the constant use of absolute magnitude bars, the reflection coefficient is often written as:

::::&lt;math&gt;\rho =\left| \Gamma  \right|&lt;/math&gt;

And since voltage is generally assumed to be the measured parameter:

::::&lt;math&gt;SWR=\frac{1+\rho }{1-\rho }&lt;/math&gt;  or  &lt;math&gt;\rho =\frac{SWR-1}{SWR+1}&lt;/math&gt;

The physical distance between two consecutive minimums corresponds to one-half the guide wavelength &lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda _{2}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The VSWR can take on any value between 1 and ∞.

If VSWR = ∞, total reflection occurs. Ideally for a matched load, VSWR = 1 and there are no reflections. In practice, it is generally not cost effective to try to reduce the VSWR below 1.1.

'''Smith Chart'''

{{wikipedia|Smith_chart}}

All values on the Smith chart are normalized to the characteristic impedance of the line.

::::&lt;math&gt;Z_{norm}=\frac{Z}{Z_{0}}&lt;/math&gt;

Impedances are described by circles on a Smith chart.

::[[Image:Smith_chart_loci.gif|left|thumb]]


This peculiar plotting method has a number of benefits. For one thing, the center of the chart corresponds to 1+1j. Consequently, it can be used to characterize any normalized transmission environment.

Furthermore, the SWR appears as a circle in the chart.

::[[Image:SWR_circle.gif|left|thumb]]

The normalized impedance is located at the intersection of SWR circle and reflection coefficient phase angle.

{{Wikipedia|Fiber-optic_communication}}

Long haul trunks were the first application of optical fiber to gain universal acceptance. Three alternate methods are coax (copper), terrestrial microwave and satellite. While microwave towers can be used to bridge relatively small bodies of water, cables or satellites are needed to span oceans. 

Telegraph cables were first deployed in the mid-1800’s and the first successful trans-Atlantic cable was laid in 1858. For 100 years copper submarine cables were the principle means of communication between North America and Europe. In the 1960’s satellites gained ascendancy but today fiber cable dominates.

Fiber cable has some significant advantages over satellite technology:

:• Fiber systems can be repaired, geo-stationary satellites cannot
:• Fiber systems have a slightly longer life expectancy
:• Fiber systems can be upgraded while in service
:• Fiber deployment has a lower risk than launching a satellite
:• Fiber propagation delay is significantly lower than satellites

==Fiber Deployment (ground based)==

'''Telecom Canada'''

The current Trans-Canada fiber system stretches some 4100 miles and includes under water links to PEI and Newfoundland. The cable is buried at a minimum depth of 5 feet in most places. The cable is buried 2 feet in rocky areas, but over major rivers such as the Thompson, it is 6 feet below the riverbed.

Eight fibers are reserved for Trans-Canada traffic, with additional fibers are used for toll traffic from the participating operating companies.

The cable has a Kevlar strength member surrounded by a star shaped polyethylene core, which can support up to 5 fiber tubes. Each fiber tube can contain up to 6 fibers. The cable has multiple layers of protection, but in avalanche prone areas, it was also encased in an 8 inch steel conduit.

===Wave-Particle Duality===

In 1678 Huygens showed that reflection and refraction could be explained by wave theory. While not rejecting the wave theory entirely, Einstein in 1905 suggested that light could be thought of as a small energy packet called a photon. This idea although not actually original, seemed to explain the Compton effect later discovered in 1921.

Today light is generally thought of as an electromagnetic wave when it is propagating. However, when it interacts with matter by means of emission or absorption, it is preferable to think in terms of photons. Photons have energy, but no rest mass. If a photon stops, it ceases to exist as a particle, and is transformed into some other form of energy, such as heat.

A rather hybrid way of thinking of light, is as a wave packet. Perhaps someday, a better model will be developed.

::[[Image:Wave_packet.gif|left|thumb]]


Light in the everyday world is incoherent. That is to say that the wave packets arrive in a chaotic, random fashion. On the other hand, coherent light as generated from a laser has the wave packets synchronized or in phase.

The perceived color of light is a function of its wavelength. The characteristic wavelength in the packet is related to its velocity and frequency:

::&lt;math&gt;v=\lambda f&lt;/math&gt;

:where:

::&lt;math&gt;v=&lt;/math&gt; velocity

::&lt;math&gt;\lambda =&lt;/math&gt; wavelength

::&lt;math&gt;f=&lt;/math&gt; frequency

It has been experimentally determined that the velocity of light in a vacuum, is about 299,793,000 meters per second. Fiber optic systems operate at a frequency of approximately 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; GHz, with the most common transmission bands at wavelengths of 0.8 - 0.9 μm and 1.2 - 1.4 μm. The amount of energy in light can be determined by quantum theory and is proportional to frequency and given by:

::&lt;math&gt;E=hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda }&lt;/math&gt;

:where:

::&lt;math&gt;E=&lt;/math&gt; Energy in Joules

::&lt;math&gt;h=6.625\times 10^{-34}\frac{J}{\sec }=&lt;/math&gt; Planck's constant

::&lt;math&gt;f=&lt;/math&gt; frequency

::&lt;math&gt;c=3\times 10^{8}\frac{m}{\sec }=&lt;/math&gt; velocity of light

::&lt;math&gt;\lambda =&lt;/math&gt; wavelength

The radiated spectral energy in watts per unit area is given by:


If we examine light at the macroscopic level, we observe that waves radiate spherically from their source. This is readily observable with incoherent sources and less pronounced with coherent sources. At a large distance, the wavefront flattens out into a plane wave. A ray path shows the direction that the wave or photon is traveling. In the case of a point source, this might resemble:

::[[Image:Ray_path.gif|left|thumb]]

When light strikes an object, it can be reflected, refracted, or absorbed. A ray of light striking the boundary between two dissimilar transparent materials is usually split into reflected and refracted rays with generally very little absorption.

Different wavelengths of light travel at the same velocity in a vacuum, but this is not true in other mediums. This change in velocity leads to refraction and color separation. If the speed is slowed in a medium, the ray is redirected towards the normal. As light leaves a slower medium and enters a faster one, it accelerates and is redirected away from the normal. 

::[[Image:Reflection_refraction.gif|left|thumb]]

By convention, the angles involved in reflection and refraction are measured with respect to the normal at the point of contact. All three components are in the same plane [there are some exceptions]. In the above illustration, the plane of incidence is the paper.

'''Displacement and Polarization'''

Energy displacement in waves can be either longitudinal or transverse with respect to the direction of travel. Longitudinal waves such as sound and seismic waves, are displaced in the direction of travel. Transverse waves such as radio and water waves are displaced at right angles to the direction of propagation.

Light travels as a TEM wave, having electric and magnetic fields perpendicular to the direction of travel. If there is no particular reason for the electrical fields of light to favor any particular orientation, the field of the waves are directed (polarized) at any angle perpendicular to the direction of propagation. This is the case with sunlight.

The combined effect of many simultaneous waves is the vector sum of all of their components. This is known as the superposition principle. This principle holds true with all forms of waves, including light. This raises an interesting question: Since the polarization and phase of natural light is totally random, why don’t the electric field components of all the waves simply average out to zero and the light cancel itself out? The reason is simple: they do average out, but, since this averaging is not exact, but is a random one, the laws of statistics hold. So, when we sum N random fields which oscillate, say, from minus to plus one, we expect that the sum is of the order of the square root of N, which can be enormously less than N, but is not zero. And, since the energy (the intensity) of light is proportional to the square of the electric field, we have that the mean energy of the sum is just N times the individual energies, which is precisely what we expect. 

A cancellation or enhancement effect do occur, but to observe it the light must be coherent. Traditionally coherent light was created by passing light from some distant source through a small hole. This effectively selects light coming from only a very small part of the originating source thus causing it to be more uniform. Today, it is easier to use a laser, which is not only very coher ent, but also essentially monochromatic. Interference patterns of light and dark areas can be observed when coherent waves intersect. 

Unpolarized light can be polarized by absorption, scattering and reflection.

===Reflection===

There are two types of reflection: diffuse and specular.

'''Diffuse Reflection'''

This is the most common form of reflection. If the illuminated object is not microscopically homogeneous in its structure, the light is scattered in all directions by multiple reflections or diffusions by its inhomogeneities (both internal and on the surface). Most materials are inhomogeneous: minerals are generally polycrystalline, organic matter is generally made by cells or fibers, so the light sent to our eyes by most objects is diffusely reflected. Because of this phenomenon, we can see other objects.

::[[Image:Diffuse_reflection.gif|left|thumb]]

Sunlight contains all of the perceived colors in such a way that their combined values look colorless. When it strikes an object, some wavelengths are absorbed, while others are reflected. The perceived color is the vector sum of all the reflected waves.

'''Specular Reflection'''

Light striking a smooth surface is reflected at the same angle with which it strikes, but suffers some loss. Instead of seeing the reflecting surface, one sees an image of where the light originates.

The reflected light can have the appearance of coming from either in front of or behind the reflecting surface. If the image appears to be behind the surface, as in the case of a mirror, it is referred to as a virtual image.

::[[Image:Virtual_image.gif|left|thumb]]

If the image is seen on a screen placed in front of the reflecting surface, it is called a real image. This principle is used in reflecting telescopes. Real images are most often generated by refraction and are used in cameras and projectors.

::[[Image:Real_image.gif|left|thumb]]

'''Variable Reflective Coatings'''

About 4% of light striking a smooth air-glass boundary is reflected. This can be reduced by applying non-reflecting coatings. Photographers and fiber optics designers are interested in non-glare coatings, since reflection reduces the amount of light entering and exiting the glass.

By depositing a thin high refractive index film over a thin low refractive index film, the amount of reflection can be increased to about 50%. This principle is used to make a beam splitter, a device of great value in optical measuring equipment and color TV cameras.

'''External Reflection'''

A phase reversal occurs when light is reflected by a more optically dense medium. This also happens when radio waves strike a metallic surface. The electric field component is short-circuited. Since the incident and reflected fields cancel at the point of incidence, the reflected waves are equal in amplitude but opposite in phase to the incident wave.

The relationship between angle of incidence and amount of reflection is very complex. At normal incidence, a reflecting surface reflects all components equally well. However, at other angles, objects prefer to reflect light having the electric field component perpendicular to the plane of incidence. At the extreme case, Brewster’s angle, only perpendicular components are reflected, and complete polarization occurs. Brewster’s angle is defined by:

::&lt;math&gt;\tan \left( \theta _{P} \right)=\frac{\eta _{1}}{\eta _{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

At Brewster’s angle, the reflected and refracted rays are at right angles to each other.

::[[Image:Brewsters_angle.gif|left|thumb]]

When noncoherent light strikes glass, about 15% of the perpendicular components are reflected, and none of the others. The refracted ray consists of the remaining 85% of the perpendicular component as well as all other orientations. The polarized reflection can be enhanced by stacking many thin glass plates together.

'''Internal Reflection'''

If light strikes an optically less dense medium, the reflected wave is not phase reversed. When the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle, total internal reflection occurs.

However, a refracted beam of sorts does exist. It is sometimes designated as frustrated total reflection or more commonly evanescent wave. This wave does not dissipate power, and extends only a few wavelengths into the faster medium. It decays exponentially according to the relationship:

::::&lt;math&gt;e^{\alpha x}&lt;/math&gt;

:where

::::&lt;math&gt;\alpha =k_{0}\sqrt{\eta _{1}^{2}\sin ^{2}\Theta _{i}-\eta _{2}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;k_{0}=&lt;/math&gt; free space propagation factor
::::&lt;math&gt;\Theta _{i}=&lt;/math&gt; angle of incidence
::::&lt;math&gt;x=&lt;/math&gt; distance into the faster medium

===Refraction===

Refracted rays create diverse effects ranging from the rainbow to the apparent bending of sticks protruding into water. From experimentation, it was observed that the ratio of the sines of the incident and refracted rays is constant:

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin \left( \theta _{0} \right)}{\sin \left( \theta _{1} \right)}=\text{ constant}&lt;/math&gt;


This constant is actually a function of the optical wavelength. Therefor, white light is separated into its various color components when refracted.

If the originating medium is a vacuum, this ratio is known as the refractive index. In practice, the refractive index for air is 1.000293 for yellow light. Therefor, for terrestrial measurements, air is regarded as a vacuum, with a refractive index of 1.

::[[Image:White_light_refraction.gif|left|thumb]]


'''Snell's Law'''

The relationship between the incident and refracted angles is given by Snell’s Law:

::::&lt;math&gt;\eta _0\sin \left( \theta _{0} \right)=\eta _{1}\sin \left( \theta _{1} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


When a light ray passes through a glass block, it is refracted twice. If the block has parallel faces, the ray will resume it original angle of attack but is slightly displaced.

The refractive index of a material is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the specific material.

::[[Image:Refraction_in_glass.gif|left|thumb]]


If the faces are not parallel, such as in a prism, the white light is separated into its various spectral components.

::[[Image:Prism_refraction.gif|left|thumb]]


In some cases these simple rules of reflection and refraction are not valid. Reflection for example, assumes a smooth boundary, and Snell’s law of refraction assumes an isotopic material. The velocity of light varies with direction in anisotopic materials.

Snell’s Law predicts the following refraction response in glass:

::[[Image:Borosilicate_Glass.gif|left|thumb]]


The reflected intensity depends on the angle of incidence and on the polarization of incident light. At a high angle of incidence, for example, the reflectance can be very high. At a certain angle (Brewster's angle) reflected light is completely polarized. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations Fresnel equations] give quantitatively the intensity of reflected light as a function of the angle of incidence and of its polarization (and, of course, of refraction index).</text>

==1. Define what &quot;soil&quot; means?==
Soil is the naturally occurring, unconsolidated or loose covering of broken rock particles and decaying organic matter (humus) on the surface of the Earth, capable of supporting life.  In simple terms, soil has three components: solid, liquid, and gas. The solid phase is a mixture of mineral and organic matter. Soil particles pack loosely, forming a soil structure filled with voids. The solid phase occupies about half of the soil volume. The remaining void space contains water (liquid) and air (gas). Soil is also known as ''earth'': it is the substance from which our planet takes its name.

==2. Where on earth is all soil located?==
Soil on the Earth is located only on its surface to a depth of about {{units|1.5 meters|60 inches}}.

==3. What are 5 key factors in soil formation?==
;Climate: Climate is the average and variations of weather in a region over long periods of time.   It affects soil formation in that it provides the forces (water, wind, etc.) necessary to erode rock into soil.
;Organisms: Organisms are living creatures (including plants, animals, fungi, etc.).  Organisms are active agents of soil formation, providing organic soil components or converting it into soil.
;Terrain: Terrain is used as a general term in physical geography, referring to the lie of the land. This is usually expressed in terms of the elevation, slope, and orientation of terrain features. Terrain affects surface water flow and distribution. 
;Parent material: Parent material means the underlying geological material (generally bedrock or a superficial or drift deposit) in which soil horizons form. Soils typically get a great deal of structure and minerals from their parent material. Parent materials are made up of consolidated or unconsolidated mineral material that has undergone some degree of physical or chemical weathering.
;Time: All of the forces that create soil require time in which to operate.  When leaves fall from trees, they are not instantly converted into soil.  Similarly, erosion is a process that occurs over time.

==4. Define the following terms:==
[[Image:Soil profile.png|thumb|220px|right|Soil Horizons]]
;a. A-Horizon: The A Horizon is the top layer of the soil horizon. The technical definition of an A Horizon may vary, but it is most commonly described in terms relative to deeper layers. A Horizons may be darker in color than deeper layers and contain more organic material, or they may be lighter but contain less clay or sesquioxides. The A is a surface horizon, and as such is also known as the zone in which most biological activity occurs. Soil organisms such as worms, nematodes, fungi, and many species of bacteria is concentrated here, often in close association with plant roots. Thus the A-horizon may be referred to as the &quot;biomantle&quot;. However, since biological activity extends far deeper into the soil, it cannot be used as a chief distinguishing feature of an A Horizon.
;b. B-Horizon: B Horizons are commonly referred to as ‘subsoil’, and consist of mineral layers which may contain concentrations of clay or minerals such as iron or aluminium, or organic material. In addition, they are defined by having a distinctly different structure or consistence to the A horizon above and the horizons below. They may also have ‘stronger’ colours (i.e. higher chroma) than the A horizon.
;c. C-Horizon: C Horizons are simply named so because they come ‘after’ A and B within the soil profile. These layers are little affected by soil forming processes, and their lack of pedological development is one of their defining attributes. C Horizons may contain lumps of unweathered rock, rather than being comprised solely of small fragments as in the solum. ‘Ghost’ rock structure may be present within these horizons.
;d. Organic layer: The upper soil horizons containing mostly organic matter.
;e. Mineral layer: The lower soil horizons containing little organic matter.
;f. Clay: Soil composed primarily of fine-grained minerals, which show plasticity through a variable range of water content, and which can be hardened when dried and/or fired.
;g. Leaching: Leaching is the loss of mineral and organic solutes due to percolation. It is a mechanism of soil formation.
;h. Silica: Silica is the chemical compound silicon dioxide, SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is most commonly found in nature as sand or quartz.
;i. Humus: Humus refers to any organic matter which has reached a point of stability, where it will break down no further and might, if conditions do not change, remain essentially as it is for centuries, if not millennia
;j. Soil Profile: The different soil horizons stacked one atop the other makes up the soil profile.
;k. Parent Material:  The rock from which mineral soil components was formed.
;l. Pedologist:  A pedologist is a scientist who studies soil in its natural environment.

{{clear}}

==5. Define the term &quot;Soil Classification&quot;. Why are soils classified?==
Soil classification deals with the systematic categorization of soils based on distinguishing characteristics as well as criteria that dictate choices in use.

Soil classification is a dynamic subject, from the structure of the system itself, to the definitions of classes, and finally in the application in the field. Soil classification can be approached from the perspective of soil as a material and soil as a resource.

For soil resources, experience has shown that a natural system approach to classification, i.e. grouping soils by their intrinsic property (soil morphology), behavior, or genesis, results in classes that can be interpreted for many diverse uses.

Criteria are designed to guide choices in land use and soil management.

==6. Discuss three differences between the following soil types:==
===a. Desert===
Aridisols (or desert soils) are a soil order in USA soil taxonomy. Aridisols (from the Latin aridus, for “dry”) form in an arid or semi-arid climate. Aridisols dominate the deserts and xeric shrublands which occupy about one third of the Earth's land surface. Aridisols have a very low concentration of organic matter. Water deficiency is the major defining characteristic of Aridisols. Also required is sufficient age to exhibit sub-soil weathering and development. Imperfect leaching in Aridisols often results in one or more subsurface soil horizons in which suspended or dissolved minerals have been deposited: silicate clays, sodium, calcium carbonate, gypsum or soluble salts. These subsoil horizons can also be cemented by carbonates, gypsum or silica. Accumulation of salts on the surface can result in salinization.

===b. Temperate===
Brown earths are mostly located between 30° and 55° north of the Equator. The largest expanses cover western and central Europe, large areas of western and trans-Uralian Russia, the east coast of America and eastern Asia. Here, areas of brown earth soil types are found particularly in Japan, the Koreas, China, eastern Australia and New Zealand. 

They generally have three horizons: the A, B and C horizon. Horizon A is usually a brownish colour, and over 20 cm in depth. It is composed of mull humus (well decomposed alkaline organic matter) and mineral matter. It is biologically active with many soil organisms and plant roots mixing the mull humus with mineral particles. As a result, the boundary between the A and B horizons can be ill defined in unploughed examples. Horizon B is mostly composed of mineral matter which has been weathered from the parent material, but it often contains inclusions of more organic material carried in by organisms, especially earthworms. It is lighter in colour than the A horizon, and is often weakly illuviated (leached). Due to limited leaching only the more soluble bases are moved down through the profile. Horizon C is made up of the parent material, which is generally permeable and non- or slightly acidic, for example clay loam.

===c. Tropical===
Oxisols are an order in USDA soil taxonomy, best known for their occurrence in tropical rain forest, 15-25 degrees north and south of the Equator. Some oxisols have been previously classified as laterite soils.

The main processes of soil formation of oxisols are weathering, humification and pedoturbation due to animals. These processes produce the characteristic soil profile. They are defined as soils containing at all depths no more than 10 percent weatherable minerals, and low cation exchange capacity. Oxisols are always a red or yellowish color, due to the high concentration of iron(III) and aluminium oxides and hydroxides. In addition they also contain quartz and kaolin, plus small amounts of other clay minerals and organic matter.

The word &quot;oxisol&quot; comes from &quot;oxide&quot; in reference to the dominance of oxide minerals such as bauxite. In the FAO soil classification, oxisols are known as ferralsols.

Scientists originally thought that the heavy vegetation of tropical rain forests would provide rich nutrients, but as rainfall passes through the litter on the forest floor the rain is acidified and leaches minerals from the above soil layers. This forces plants to get their nutrition from decaying litter as oxisols are quite infertile due to the lack of organic matter and the almost complete absence of soluble minerals leached by the wet and humid climate.

==7. Examine a 2-foot vertical section of soil. Label the different types of organic matter found, identify the different soil horizons, and mark the transition from the soil layer to the mineral layer.==
Find a place where you have permission to dig a 2-foot deep hole.  In the United States, '''call before you dig'''. Digger's Hotline, One-call or Miss Utility are services that allow construction workers to contact utility companies, who will then denote where underground utilities are located via color-coding those locations. As required by law and assigned by the FCC, the 8-1-1 telephone number will soon be used for this purpose across the United States.

Failure to call such a number ahead of time may result in a fine or even a charge against the person or company, particularly if such negligence causes a major utility outage or serious accident, or an evacuation due to a gas leak. Hitting a water main may also trigger a boil-water advisory and local flooding.

A few utilities are permanently marked with short posts or bollards, mainly for lines carrying petroleum products.

Once you have clearance, get your shovel and start the hole.  If you are lucky, perhaps someone you know is already digging a hole, and if so, ask permission to come in and make your observations.  People dig holes for all kinds of reasons: footers for building a deck, trenches for laying pipe or cable, foundation for a new building, or to add to an existing one.  But if no one you know is digging a hole, you may have to get out the shovel yourself.

You can label the required features with craft sticks and a pen.  Simply write a label on the craft stick with the pen, and insert it into the soil near the feature you wish to label.  Alternatively, you could take a photograph of the vertical section and then import it into a word processor.  Then add the labels to the photo digitally.

==8. Draw, photograph, or collect and correctly label 5 different soil types.==
Listed below are a few types of soil you might collect.  For a more complete listing of soil types, see the [[w:Category:Types of soil|Types of soil]] category in Wikipedia.
===Sandy soil===
Sandy soil consists of relatively large particles (sand).  It has a gritty texture.  Sandy soil, if mixed well with organic matter, is a good medium for growing plants as long as it is kept moist.  Because the particles are so large, water and air easily penetrate the soil and reach the roots of plants.  However, this same quality allows the water to drain away almost immediately (which is why it must be kept moist if used for agriculture).
===Silty soil===
Silty soil is like sandy soil except that it contains finer particles and more nutrients.  It has a darker color as well.  Silty soil is one of the best soils for agriculture because like sandy soil, it allows water and air to penetrate to the roots, but unlike sandy soil, it hold the water longer.

===Clay soil===
Clay soil is made of very fine particles.  While it is replete with minerals, plants may have a difficult time extracting them because clay is so impermeable.  Wet clay will clump together when wadded into a ball in the palm of the hand.
===Loamy Soil===
Loamy soil is a mixture of sand, silt, and some clay.  It is considered the ideal soil for agriculture, as it has good drainage and plenty of plant nutrients.
===Peaty Soil===
Peat is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation matter. Peat forms in wetlands or peatlands, variously called bogs, moors, muskegs, pocosins, mires, and peat swamp forests.

Peat forms when plant material, usually in marshy areas, is inhibited from decaying fully by acidic and anaerobic conditions. It is composed mainly of marshland vegetation: trees, grasses, fungi, as well as other types of organic remains, such as insects, and animal corpses. 

Peat is soft and easily compressed. Under pressure, water in the peat is forced out. Upon drying, peat can be used as a fuel. Peat is also dug into soil to increase the soil's capacity to retain moisture and add nutrients. This makes it important agriculturally, for farmers and gardeners.

===Chalky Soil=== 
Chalky soil is highly alkaline.  It is composed primarily of the mineral calcite.  Because chalk is porous it can hold a large volume of ground water, providing a natural reservoir that releases water slowly through dry seasons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''optical disk drive''' is a storage medium from which data is read and to which it is written by lasers. Optical disks can store much more data, up to 6 gigabytes (6 billion bytes), than most portable magnetic media, such as floppy disks. 

There are several basic types of optical disks:
# CD-ROM : Like audio CDs, CD-ROMs come with data already encoded onto them. The data is permanent and can be read any number of times, but CD-ROMs cannot be modified.
# WORM : Stands for write-once, read -many. With a WORM disk drive, you can write data onto a WORM disk, but only once. After that, the WORM disk behaves just like a CD-ROM.
# CD-R: Stands for Compact-Disc Recordable, which can be written to once (aside from multisession writing).  
# CD-RW: Stands for Compact-Disc Rewriteable, which behave similar to CD-R but can be erased to create a new blank disk.  
# DVD: A Digital Versatile Disc, which allows storing up to 4.7 GB. May appear as Double-Layer to contain 8.5 GB, and can even be double-sided to double the capacity once again.  
# DVD-R: A recordable version of DVDs.
# DVD-RW: A rewritable version of DVDs. 

These three technologies are not compatible with one another; each requires a different type of disk drive and disk. Even within one category, there are many competing formats, although CD-ROMs are relatively standardized.

&gt;Since the Hamiltonian is invariant with time, it represents the energy.  

Not true in general.  
It's the energy in this case, but the quoted sentence doesn't provide justification for that.
Work out &lt;math&gt;T(v)=\tfrac 1 2 v^2 + \tfrac 1 6 v^3&lt;/math&gt; sometime to see a counterexample where the Hamiltonian function isn't the same as the energy.

The best move for white here is 6.Qxd4. This leads to 6.- Qxd4 7.Nxd4. This line is thougt to slight favor black.
6.Nxd4?! is bad because of 6.- c5! and after 7.Nb5 or 7.Nb3, black shall play Qxd1+!, which will give him an advantage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= the address book =
I have obtained some notes on use of Alloy for the building of models and I have
copy of Daniel Jackson's book. I propose to build new model on „Digital Art Exhibition“
which is essentially isomorphic to address book in the &quot;Whirlwind Tour&quot; (Михал Орела 13:12, 11 August 2008 (UTC))

The model has been built, encoded, and executed.
The results are very pleasing. We now have a new model isomorphic to the address book model.
(Михал Орела 18:43, 11 August 2008 (UTC))
==the code itself==
Using the inbuilt code tags gives a very ugly result.
Time to try something more sensible and elegant.
(Михал Орела 17:39, 15 August 2008 (UTC))

== the screenshot ==
The next problem to be resolved was the issue of use of a screenshot
under a suitable Wikimedia Commons License.

Fortunately, there is a special MIT License which is available; Daniel Jackson is at MIT.
The screenshot is now also incorporated. (Михал Орела 18:43, 11 August 2008 (UTC))

== white space ==
I have stuff working.
However, there is far too much white space.
The images were chosen to be roughly the same size and to be square shaped.
I might experiment a bit with the presentation... later.
(Михал Орела 19:27, 11 August 2008 (UTC))

==Alloy analyzer==
The diagrams are all produced now with
Alloy Analyzer 4.1.8 (build date: 2008/08/07 16:29 EDT)

The old line goes: 9...Nc5 10. c3 d4 11. cxd4 Nxd4. The new variation goes: 11.Ng5!? Qxg5. Black is thought to equalize in both lines.

== The {{tlx|New book}} Template ==

Hello Kkmane, how are you? I noticed you removed the {{tlx|New book}} template form the [[Easyfoss]] book. That template should really remain on the book for at least a week (and typically much more). It helps your book to appear in the list at [[Template:New]], which is included in a number of high-traffic pages. Basically, it's free advertising, it helps to attract new contributors and new readers to the project. It also helps to ensure that the book becomes properly categorized, so nothing gets lost. 

I put the template back on the book for now. If you have any questions about this, please let me know. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:05, 14 August 2008 (UTC)

* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
This section is for advanced learners with an expert level of Korean.

==각다분하다==
tiresome: 일을 해 나가기가 고되고 힘들다 (하루 종일 운전하려니 '''각다분하다'''.)
 
==구성지다==
graceful: 천연스럽고 구수하며 멋지다 (할아버지의 '''구성진''' 노랫가락을 들어 봐라.)
 
==초름하다==
insufficient: 충분하지 못하거나 조금 부족하다 (여비가 좀 '''초름하니까''' 아껴 쓰자.)
 
==어금버금하다==
hardly different: 서로 엇비슷해서 차이가 별로 없다 (우리는 '''어금버금한''' 실력이다.)
 
==가직하다==
near: 거리가 조금 가깝다 (멀리 가지 말고 '''가직한''' 곳에서 놀아라.)
 
==다붓하다==
close: 사이가 멀지 않다, 조용하고 호젓하다 ('''다붓하게''' 떨어져 있다.)
 
==덧거칠다==
go wrong: 일이 잘못되어 가다 (아무리 애를 써 봐도 사업은 '''덧거칠어만''' 갔다.)
 
==간동하다==
잘 정돈되어 홀가분하다 (방을 간동하게 정리했다.)
 
==덜퍽지다==
매우 넉넉하고 탐스럽다 (소쿠리에 귤을 덜퍽지게 담아 왔다.)
 
==시뜻하다==
탐탁하지 않거나 싫증이 난 듯하다 (시뜻한 표정으로 상을 물리었다.)
 
==가무리다==
몰래 감춰 두다, 몰래 혼자 차지하다 (문갑에 가무려 둔 통장을 꺼냈다.)
 
==잡도리하다==
일이 어긋나지 않도록 단속하다 (기밀이 새지 않도록 잡도리했다.)
 
==그들먹히다==
거의 그득하다 (물통에 물이 그들먹하게 찼다)
 
==숙수그레하다==
여러 개의 크기가 고르다 (정원에 심은 묘목들이 숙수그레하다.)
 
==암팡지다==
체구는 작아도 야무지고 당차다 (내 동생은 초등학생이지만 참 암팡지다.)
 
==우두망찰하다==
갑자기 일을 당해 정신없이 어쩔 줄 몰라 하다 (엄마는 그런 상태에서 느끼는 어떤 위기의식과 이웃으로부터의 따돌림으로 늘 우두망찰한 표정을 짓고 있을 뿐, 이래라저래라 자기 의견을 말하지 않았다.)
 
==가탈==
이리저리 트집을 잡아 까다롭게 구는 일 (페루 음식에 대한 심한 가탈로 석철은 쿠즈코에서 쫓겨났다.)
 
==깜냥==
스스로 일을 판단할 수 있는 능력 (제 깜냥엔, 외무고시 1차를 통과한 자신이 자랑스러웠다.)

==달포==
한 달이 약간 넘는 기간 (그 후 석철은 거의 달포나 MSN에 로그인 하지 않았다.)

==선잠==
깊이 들지 못하고 살짝 드는 잠. (시험을 앞두고 긴장을 한 탓인지 간밤에는 내내 선잠만 잤다.)

==헤살==
짓궂게 남의 일을 방해함. 또는 그런 짓. (여교수는 석철이 하는 일마다 짓게 헤살을 놓았다.)
 
==고갱이==
식물 줄기의 가운데 위치한 연한 부분, 사물의 핵심이 되는 부분 (한 민족의 문화와 정신을 이해하는 고갱이는 말이다.)
 
==어깃장==
일부러 다른 사람의 일이 어긋나도록 하는 말이나 행동 (순순히 협조하는 것 같더니 차츰 어깃장을 놓기 시작했다.)
 
==화수분==
재물이 계속해서 쏟아져 나오는 보물단지. (넌 내가 무슨 화수분인 줄 아니? 어째 나만 보면 돈 얘기냐!)
 
==생때같다==
통 병이 없을 정도로 몸이 튼튼하고 건강하다. (생때같던 사람이 하룻밤 사이에 갑자스럽게 세상을 세상을 떠 버렸다.)
 
==속절없다==
단념하는 것 외에는 달리 마땅한 방법이 없다. (아무리 기다려도 그녀는 어지 않고, 나는 속절없이 담배만 피워 댔다.)
 
==수더분하다==
성질이 까다롭지 않고 순하고 소박하다. (모름지기 사람이란 수더분하고 어수룩한 맛이 있어야 한다.)
 
==애달프다==
마음이 쓰리거나 몹시 안타깝다. (남편을 지척에 두고 만나지 못하는 애달픈 마음이야 오죽하겠는가.)
 
==올곧다==
정신 상태나 마음이 올바르고 곧다. 줄이 바르다. (한평생을 한눈팔지 않고 자기의 길만을 올곧게 걸어온 사람이다.)
 
==옹골지다==
속이 꽉 차 있어서 실속이 있다. (겉으로 자리 보여도 살림 하나는 옹골지게 잘하는 여편네다.)
 
==하릴없다==
달리 어쩔 도리가 없다. 조금도 틀림이 없다. (비를 맞으며 문 앞에 쭈그리고 있는 그의 모습은 하릴없는 거지였다.)
 
==여북==
얼마나, 오죽의 뜻을 나타내며, 언짢거나 안타까움을 드러냄 (아, 여북 답답했으면 내가 이러겠어?)
 
==적이==
약간, 얼마간 (적이 안심이 되는 한편 더욱 더 착잡해지고 하는 듯한 두 개의 얼국이 수시로 변덕을 부리며 엇갈리고 있었다.)
 
==짐짓==
마음은 그렇지 않으면서 일부러 (그것이 사랑에서 즐겨 찾는 국거리인 줄 번연히 알면서도 짐짓 그렇게 묻는 거였다.)
 
==되우==
매우 몹시 (누나는 이 말에 되우 놀라며 눈을 말똥말똥 떴다.)
 
==무릇==
대체적으로 보아 (부모가 물려주는 거만의 유산은 무릇 불행을 낳기 쉽다.)
 
==섬뻑==
어떤 일이 행해진 뒤 곧바로 (혹시 내가 말을 너무 까다롭게 내기 때문에 섬뻑 대답이 안 나왔거나 그랬겠지요.)
 
==얼추==
대충, 대강 (일이 얼추 끝나 가는 것 같군.)
 
==좀체==
여간해서, 쉽사리 (그는 좀체 입을 열지 않는 성격이다.)
 
==길래==
오래도록 (계양산에 가서 길래 계실 터인가요?)
 
==노상==
늘 같은 모양으로 (김 장자는 자나 깨나 노상 그 아들로 하여 은근히 걱정 중이겠다.)
 
==사뭇==
거리낌 없이 전혀 딴판으로 사무칠 정도로 몹시, 줄곧 (그의 기분은 아까 오전과는 사뭇 달라 보였다.)
 
==자못==
생각보다 훨씬 더 (마을 친척들도 명식의 경솔한 언도이 자못 불쾌한 모양이었다.)
 
==잼처==
어떤 일에 바로 뒤이어 거듭. (어해가 어리둥절하고 미처 대답 못하는 것을 보고 그 여자는 잼처 묻는다.)
 
==객쩍다==
언행이나 생각이 쓸데없고 싱겁다 (객쩍은 소리 그만 두어요. 그따위 실업는 소리를 할 때가 아니에요.)
 
==발자하다==
성미가 급하다 (발자하게 새새거리며 날뛰는 겨애보다 은근하고 깊이가 있어 보여서)
 
==살핏하다==
짜거나 엮은 것이 다소 거칠고 성기다

==해사하다==
낯빛이 희고 말쑥하다 (해사하게 생긴 그 얼굴 모습과 같이 명쾌한 가운데도 안존하고 순편한 편이요.)

==괄괄하다==
성격이 드세고 급하다 (성미가 괄괄하고 입심이 좋기 때문에 양반의 글방에를 다닐 때도 누구한테나 결코 만만하게는 보이지 않았다.)

==애잔하다==
가날프고 약하다, 몹시 애틋하고 애처롭다 (대불이는 마음속으로 형님도 벌써 늙었구나 하고 생각하면서 애잔한 눈빛으로 마주 보았다.)

==음전하다==
얌전하고 우아하다 (금개의 말하는 태도는 그대로 음전하고 순박했다.)

==데데하다==
몹시 볍변치 못하여 보잘것없다 (그렇게 데데한 남자를 얻다 써먹어.)

==머쓱하다==
무안을 당해 어색하고 열없다 (사내가 물러가자 나는 오히려 머쓱한 기분이 들었다.)

==추레하다==
겉모습이 보잘것없고 궁상스럽다 (달수의 그런 추레한 꼴을 본 사람들은 경멸에 앞서 동정을 보냈다.)

==곰살스럽다==
얼굴 따위가 얌전하고 고와 보이다 (그녀의 목소리는 곱살스러웠다.)

==데퉁스럽다==
언행이 거칠고 엉뚱하여 미련스러운 데가 있다 (데퉁스럽게 대답했다.)

==든적스럽다==

==영절스럽다==
보기에 아주 그럴듯하다 (그 화가는 도시의 전경을 영절스럽게 묘사하였다.)

==갸웃하다==
무엇을 이상하게 여기며 머리나 몸을 한쪽으로 비스듬히 기울이다 (그녀는 한패를 돌아다모면서 고개를 갸웃했다.)

==도두보다==
실제보다 좋게 보다 (제 것이면 도두보고 남의 것은 깔보려 하는 것이 인간의 숙명적인 성격인가 보다.)

==바루다==
안절부절못하다 (잘못된 것을 바루었다.)

A '''''Bouquet garni''''' or '''Herb Bouquet''' is a combination of 
*parsley 
*thyme
*bay leaf 

which are tied in a bunch and used in flavouring sauces, stews, soups, casseroles and other dishes. Sometimes other ingredients are added such as:

*peppercorns 
*celery or celery seed 
*fennel seed 
*coriander seed
*cloves
*garlic  

In the latter case, or if dried herbs are used,  the aromatics are tied up in a piece of cheesecloth with a length of string that can be tied to the handle of the cooking vessel. Later the string can be used to retrieve and discard the bag.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Child (1961), ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking'', Alfred A. Knopf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This manual was developed specifically for freshmen students taking up their first course in programming, but people who are interested in learning C are also welcome to study it. Its aim is to supplement classroom lectures by focusing on C programming. Topics are arranged based on the order of class discussion. 

Aside from changes in programming language and presentation, additional sections have been included. Some frequently asked questions and common programming errors are listed at the end of the chapter. 

Only a subset of the ANSI C language is tackled here. Specifically, it is assumed that the student will be working under the Linux environment and programming using GNU C (which supports ANSI C)or the Borland Turbo C/C++ compiler under the Windows environment. Coding standards to be followed, as well as some pointers when programming using the Linux environment, are also included. 

May you learn a lot from the study of this manual, and may the knowledge that you have gained be used for the common good of all people.  


Sincerely yours,

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Art in the Making==
The impact of the digital computer in the twentieth century is so great that the computer has become a vital component in our society. It has practically touched every aspect of our lives. it helps us in our business transactions, keeps track of products' inventories, diagnoses heart conditions, recognizes speech patterns, and provides entertainment through games, among a hundred other applications. Its impact is so great that it has revolutionized our society and made us re-examine certain basic assumptions about our own role in the universe. Computers have evolved from a scientific curiosity to an indispensable tool in virtually all areas of our lives. 

However true it is that computers can solve problems efficiently and accurately and how sophisticated    it can be, it still cannot think for itself -- it cannot solve problems on its own. It is the human being who understands, thinks and solves problems on its own and who gives correct instruction that directs the computer to solve problems. The set or list of instructions that directs the computer on its operations is called a ''computer program''. The person who develops a program is called a ''programmer''. The act of developing a program is called ''programming''. 

Computer programming is not just plainly listing down lengthy steps to be communicated to the computer. It is not a matter of &quot;just write anything and make it run&quot;. The programmer must learn to put his logic and his creativity to make his work a masterpiece. Computer programming needs to be an art!

==Problem Analysis==

If we are to use the computer as a problem-solving tool, then we must have a good analysis of the problem given. Here are some suggested steps on how to go about analyzing a certain problem for computer application:

1. Review the problem carefully and understand what you are asked to do. 

2. Determine what information is given(input) and what result must be produced(output). 

3. Assign names to each input and output items. 

4. Determine the manner of processing that must be done on the input data to come up with the desired output(i.e., determine what formulas are needed to manipulate the given data). 


'''''Example'''''

Given the scores for the two departmental quizzes, two machine projects, final exam, and teacher's evaluation, write a program that will compute for the final grade based on the following computation:


  50% Average of two departmental quizzes
 +15% average of 2 machine projects 
 +30% Final exam
 +5%  Teacher's evaluation

* Our Father, who art in heaven,
* Hallowed be thy Name.
* Thy kingdom come.
* Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
* Give us this day our daily bread.
* And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
* And lead us not into temptation,
* But deliver us from evil.
* For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever.
* Amen

Second book of the new testement of our lord Jesus Christ. The holy gospel according to Mark. Chapter One


# The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
# It is written in Isaiah the prophet: &quot;I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way&quot;--  
# &quot;a voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.&quot; ''The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God''.   
# And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.  
# The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.  
# John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.  
# And this was his message: &quot;After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.  
# I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.&quot;  
# At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.  
# As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.

==Notes==
* The text ''abkai ejen i jui Isus Hristos i ewanggelinuma i deribun oho'' in italics appears at the end of 1:3 in the Manchu version as opposed to 1:1 in the King James version of the bible. In the text and translation I have included it twice: in italics where it isn't in the original and in normal font where it is.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Favorite Coding standard and Guidelines=
Please when making changes try to apply the standards to any surrounding code. This is especially true of comments and variable naming.

==Indentation and Spacing==
'''Braces'''
*Braces shall follow &quot;Extended Style&quot;.
**The Extended Bracing Style means that the curly brace pair are lined up with the surrounding statement. Statements and declarations between the braces are indented relative to the braces.
*Braces shall be indented 2 columns to the right of the starting position of the enclosing statement or declaration.
*Loop and conditional statements shall always have brace enclosed sub-statements.
**The code looks more consistent if all conditional and loop statements have braces.&lt;br&gt;Even if there is only a single statement after the condition or loop statement today, there might be a need for more code in the future.
*Braces without any contents or a single statement may be placed on the same line.

'''Lines'''
*Use blank lines to improve readability.
**They separate blocks of code which are in themselves logically related.
*Lines shall not exceed 79 characters.
**Even if your editor handles long lines, other people may have set up their editors differently. Long lines in the code may also cause problems for other programs and printers.
*Each statement shall be placed on a line on its own.
**There is no need to make code compact. Putting several statements on the same line only makes the code cryptic to read.

'''Spaces'''
*No space between a function name and the parenthesis &quot; (&quot; starting its parameter list.
*All binary arithmetic, bitwise and assignment operators and the ternary conditional operator (?:) shall be surrounded by spaces; the comma operator shall be followed by a space but not preceded; all other operators shall not be used with spaces.
*Do not use tabs.
**Tabs make the source code difficult to read where different programs treat the tabs differently. The same code can look very differently in different views.&lt;br&gt;Avoid using tabs in your source code to avoid this problem. Use spaces instead.

==Entity Naming==
*Entity naming shall be done in English.
**Enables internationalization of the code.
*Use sensible, descriptive names.
**Do not use short cryptic names or names based on internal jokes. It shall be easy to type a name without looking up how it is spelt.&lt;br&gt;Exception: Loop variables and variables with a small scope (less than 20 lines) may have short names to save space if the purpose of that variable is obvious.
*Only use English names.
**It is confusing when mixing languages for names. English is the preferred language because of its spread in the software market and because most libraries used already use English.
*Variables with a large scope shall have long names, variables with a small scope can have short names.
**Scratch variables used for temporary storage or indices are best kept short. A programmer reading such variables shall be able to assume that its value is not used outside a few lines of code. Common scratch variables for integers are i, j, k, m, n and for characters c and d.
*Use namespaces for identifiers declared in different modules
**This avoids name clashes.
*Use name prefixes for identifiers declared in different modules
**This avoids name clashes.
*Function names must have first letter of every word in caps.
*Member functions should be named after actions
**Examine the contract between the member function and its client
*Name things after what they represent.
**If you can't think of what it is that is a clue you have not thought through the design well enough.
*Include Units in Names
**If it is a representation of time, weight, or some other unit then include the unit in the name so developers can more easily spot problems.

==Comments==
*Comments shall be written in English.
*Comments shall use the C++-style whenever possible but C style is possible for in a line mid code commenting and multi-line function introductory comment. (except contructors/destructors)
*All comments shall be placed above the line the comment describes, indented identically or after the code in the same line.
**Being consistent on placement of comments removes any question on what the comment refers to.
*Every class shall have a comment that describes its purpose.
*Every function should have a comment that describes its purpose.
*Constant names must always be all caps.
*Function comments should include any precondition and postcondition and side effects.
*Parameter comments must indicate change of ownership.

==Files==
*C++ source files shall have extension &quot;.c&quot;.
*C++ header files shall have extension &quot;.h&quot;.
*There should only be one externally visible class defined in each header file.
**Having as few declarations as possible in a header file reduces header dependencies.
*The header file shall have the same name as the class plus extension &quot;.h&quot;.
*External non-member functions that belong to the class interface may also be declared in the same header file.
*File names shall be treated as case sensitive.
*Files must have the &quot;#pragma once&quot; include guards.
*System header files shall be included with &lt;&gt; and project headers with &quot;&quot;.
*Put #include directives at the top of files.
**Having all #include directives in one place makes it easy to find them.
*Do not use absolute directory names in #include directives.
**The directory structure may be different on other systems.

==Declarations==
*Provide names of parameters in function declarations.
**Parameter names are useful to document what the parameter is used for.&lt;br&gt;The parameter names shall be the same in all declarations and definitions of the function.
*Use a typedef to define a pointer to a function.
**Pointers to functions have a strange syntax. The code becomes much clearer if you use a typedef for the pointer to function type. This typedef name can then be used to declare variables etc.
*Declare each item in a separate declaration.
**One declaration per line. It avoids the problem of knowing which variables are pointers.&lt;br&gt;int* p, i;&lt;br&gt;It is easy to forget that the star belongs to the declared name, not the type, and look at this and say that the type is &quot;pointer to int&quot; and both p and i are declared to this type. It also encourages commenting and it is easier to read.
*Avoid use of exception specifications.
**Exception specifications in C++ are not as useful as they look. The compiler does not make the code more efficient. On the contrary, the compiler has to insert code to check that called functions do not violate the specified exception specification at runtime.
*Declare inherited functions virtual.
**An inherited function is implicitly virtual if it is declared virtual in the base class. Repeat the virtual keyword when declaring an inherited function in a derived class to make it clear that this function is virtual.
*Do not use global using declarations and using directives in headers.
**Bringing in names from a namespace to the global namespace may cause conflicts with other headers. The author of a header does not know in which context the header is used and should avoid polluting the global namespace. Instead, only use using declarations in the source files.
*Do not use using directives.
**Bringing in names from a namespace can cause all sorts of problems as the namespace might contain more names than you would expect.
*Declare class data private.
**Classes shall encapsulate their data and only provide access to this data by member functions to ensure that data in class objects are consistent.&lt;br&gt;The exception to the rule is C type struct that only contains data members.
*Only use the keyword struct for C-style structs.
*Functions that can be implemented using public interface of a class shall not be members.
**A class definition can be kept small and less prone to change if it only defines the core functionality. Any other functions that can be implemented with this minimal class definition shall be implemented as non-member functions. They are still seen as part of the interface of the class.

==Statements==
*Never use gotos.
**Gotos break structured coding.
*All switch statements shall have a default label.
**Even if there is no action for the default label, it shall be included to show that the programmer has considered values not covered by case labels. If the case labels cover all possibilities, it is useful to put an assertion there to document the fact that it is impossible to get here. An assertion also protects from a future situation where a new possibility is introduced by mistake.

==Other==
*Avoid macros.
**Most macros can be replaced by constants, enumerations or inline functions.&lt;br&gt;As macros are not part of the C++ language, they do not provide type safety and debugger support.
*Use parentheses within macros around parameter names.
**It's generally a good idea to use extra parentheses for macro parameters, it avoids the parameters from being parsed in a unintended ways. But there are some exceptions to consider:&lt;br&gt;- Since comma operator have lower precedence than any other, this removes the possibility of problems.&lt;br&gt; - When concatenating tokens with the ## operator, converting to strings using the # operator, or concatenating adjacent string literals, parameters cannot be individually parenthesized.
*Macro replacement lists should be parenthesized.
**&quot;#define CUBE(X) (X) * (X) * (X)&quot; as &quot;#define CUBE(X) ((X) * (X) * (X))&quot;
*Do not use literal numbers other than 0 and 1.
**Use constants instead of literal numbers to make the code consistent and easy to maintain. The name of the constant is also used to document the purpose of the number.
*Check all fail point, use plenty of assertions.
**Assertions are useful to verify pre-conditions, post-conditions and any other conditions that should never happen. Pre-conditions are useful to verify that functions are called with valid arguments. They are also useful as documentation of what argument value ranges a function is designed to work with.&lt;br&gt;Assertions are macros that print error messages when the condition is not met. The macros are disabled in release mode and do not cost anything in performance or used memory in the end product. 
*Use prefix increment/decrement instead of postfix increment/decrement when the value of the variable is not used.
**For class objects there may be two different member functions for the postfix and prefix operations. The postfix operation has to keep a temporary return value of the object before changing the object. For built-in objects this does not matter as the compiler will be able to optimize away the temporary value when it is not used.&lt;br&gt;Even if this only matters for class objects, it is a good habit to use prefix increment/decrement at all times.
*Write conditional expressions like: if ( 6 == errorNum ) ...
**This style avoids accidental assignments of the variable when the comparison operator is written with only one equal sign (=).
*Use the new cast operators.
**Use dynamic_cast, const_cast, reinterpret_cast and static_cast instead of the traditional C cast notation. These document better what is being performed.
*Avoid use of implicit conversion to bool in conditions.

Yes, Question Writer has the option to &quot;Publish for Printing&quot; which creates an HTML document.  You can find out more about this in [[../../Save and Publish/Publish your Quiz/Publish for Printing|Publish for Printing]].

An alternative approach is to start from the other end.  If you write the questions in a Word document, you could reformat them slightly and save the document as a .txt or .rtf file then import the questions into Question Writer.  See [[../../Extras/Importing Questions/text format|Text Format]] for more details on this.

Hi there, welcome to wikibooks.  Just a note on your new book Stata.  You need to follow the [[WB:NP|naming convention]].  So the subpages need to be called Stata/Creating a DO File for example.  Let me know if you have any questions. --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 07:53, 13 August 2008 (UTC)

== Overview ==

[[w:Zope_3|Zope 3]] consists of a number of small frameworks and libraries written in [[w:Python_Programming|Python programming language]] and it is usable in pieces or in whole.  These frameworks and libraries can be put together to build any kind of web application.  Normally, Zope 3 applications are developed using a Python based build system called [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout Buildout].  Zope 3 is built on top of a component architecture  to separate presentation code from the problem domain code and to create reusable components (''zope.component'').  

Zope 3 has an object publisher (''zope.publisher''), web server (''zope.server''), transactional object database (''ZODB''), XML-configuration language for registering components (''zope.configuration''), flexible security architecture with pluggable security policies (''zope.security''), unit and functional testing frameworks (''zope.testing'', ''zope.testbrowser''), XHTML-compliant templating language (''zope.pagetemplate''), schema engine and automatic form generation machinery (''zope.schema'', ''z3c.form'') and many more core and third-party packages.

Originally, the term ''ZOPE'' was used as an acronym for ''Z Object Publishing Environment'' (the ''Z'' doesn't really mean anything in particular).  However, now-a-days ''ZOPE'' is simply written as ''Zope''.

Zope 3 is a ZPL (BSD like, GPL compatible license) licensed free/open source software.  It was developed by the Zope community with the leadership of Jim Fulton.  A brief history is given in the next section.

The main aim of this book is to create a free online book about Zope 3.  This book will cover how to develop web applications using Zope 3 components.  You suggestions and edits are always welcome.

== Scope of the book ==

The intension of this book is not to cover how to use Zope 3 packages independently or with other Python applications/frameworks.  Rather, this book focus on developing web applications using Zope 3 packages.  More specifically, this book is not going to cover using Zope 3 technology in Zope 2, Plone, Grok or any plain Python application/framework.  WSGI is also not a current focus of this book.  This book is not going to cover using zopeproject to bootstrap application (it's very easy, look at the PyPI page for zopeproject).  This book use Buildout for setting up an isolated development environment for building applications.  Setuptools and vitualenv also will be covered.

== Audience ==

The target audience of this book are Python programmers looking for developing web applications. However, the book doesn't assume you are familiar with any other web framework.

== Prerequisites ==

This book will require prior knowledge Python programming language and at least some exposure to the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

== Brief history ==

The beginning of Zope’s story goes something like this, in 1996, Jim Fulton (CTO of Zope Corporation) was drafted to teach a class on common gateway interface (CGI) programming, despite not knowing very much about the subject. CGI programming is a commonly-used web development model that allows developers to construct dynamic websites. On his way to the class, Jim studied all the existing documentation on CGI. On the way back, Jim considered what he didn’t like about traditional, CGI-based programming environments. From these initial musings, the core of Zope was written while flying back from the CGI class.

Zope Corporation (then known as Digital Creations) went on to release three open-source software packages to support web publishing: Bobo, Document Template, and BoboPOS. These packages were written in a language called Python, and provided a web publishing facility, text templating, and an object database, respectively. Digital Creations developed a commercial application server based on their three opensource components. This product was called Principia. In November of 1998, investor Hadar Pedhazur convinced Digital Creations to open source Principia. These packages evolved into what are now the core components of Zope 2.

In 2001, the Zope community began working on a component architecture for Zope, but after several years they ended up with something much more: Zope 3. While Zope 2 was powerful and popular, Zope 3 was designed to bring web application development to the next level.  This book is about this Zope 3, which is not really a new version of Zope 2.

Most recently, in 2007 the Zope community created yet another framework based on Zope 3 called Grok. The original Zope which is now known as Zope 2 is also widely used.

== Organization of the book ==

This book has divided into multiple chapters.  Summary of each chapter is given below.

=== Introduction ===

This chapter introduce Zope 3 with an overview and scope of the book, then briefly go through the history of Zope 3.  Later discuss organization of the book.  And finish with a ''thanks'' section.

===  Getting Started ===

This chapter begins with installation details of Python and Zope 3.  Then introduce ''Buildout'', the build system we use to setup an isolated Python working environment and its configurations.  Later, it explore setting up development sandbox using Buildout.  A simple application is developed further and it ends with a ''Hello world'' page.  During the application development we see how to use ZMI (Zope Management Interface) briefly.  This chapter also provides a brief overview of important packages and installation of additional packages.

=== Interfaces ===

This chapter introduce the concept of interfaces.

== Thanks ==

This book would not be possible if Zope 3 did not exist. For that, the authors would like to thank all developers of Zope 3.  Thanks to wikibooks for providing this space for book.  Thanks to all editors of this book.

== Python installation ==

The Zope community has always recommended using a custom built Python for development and deployment. Python 2.4 is the recommended version for Zope 3, although Python 2.5 will also work, but it is not yet officially supported.

=== GNU/Linux ===

To install Python, you will be required to install gcc, g++ and other development tools in your system. A typical installation of Python can be done like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ wget -c http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.4.5/Python-2.4.5.tar.bz2
$ tar jxvf Python-2.4.5.tar.bz2
$ cd Python-2.4.5
$ ./configure --prefix=/home/guest/usr
$ make
$ make install
&lt;/source&gt;

As given above, you can provide an option, ''--prefix'' to install Python in a particular location.  The above steps install Python inside ''/home/guest/usr'' directory.

After installation, you can invoke the Python interpreter like this (~ is an alias to ''/home/guest''):

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ ~/usr/bin/python2.4
&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
Hello, world!
&lt;/source&gt;

{{TextBox|
If you are not getting old statements in Python interactive prompt when using up-arrow key, try installing ''libreadline'' development libraries (Hint: apt-cache search libreadline).  After installing this library, you should install Python again.  You also will be required to install ''zlib'' (Hint: apt-cache search zlib compression library) to properly install Zope 3.
}}

=== MS Windows ===

'''FIXME''': Write about installation of Python in MS Windows with few screen shots.

== Buildout ==

=== Introduction ===

We are going to use a build tool called Buildout for developing Zope 3 applications from multiple parts.  Buildout will give you an isolated working environment for developing applications.  The Buildout package, named ''zc.buildout'' is available for [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout download from PyPI].  This section briefly goes through the usage of Buildout for developing applications.

Buildout has a ''boostrap.py'' script for initializing a buildout based project for development or deployment.  It will download and install ''zc.buildout'', ''setuptools'' and other dependency modules in a specified directory.  Once bootstrapped it will create a ''buildout'' executable script inside ''bin'' directory at the top of your project source.  The default configuration for each project is ''buildout.cfg'' file at the top of your project source.  Whenever you run the ''buildout'' command it will look into the default configuration file and will do actions based on it.  Normally, the configuration file and boostrap script will be bundled with the project source itself.  Other than the default configuration file along with the project source, you may also create a system wide default configuration file at ''~/.buildout/default.cfg''.

Buildout creator Jim Fulton recommend a custom built clean Python installation, i.e., there should not be any Python modules installed in your ''site-packages'' (ideally, a fresh Python installation).  When you boostrap your project using Buildout's ''boostrap.py'' script, it will download and install all necessary packages in a specified directory.  So, for an ideal project you only required a ''custom built clean Python'' and the project source with proper ''Buildout configuration'' and ''bootstrap script'' along with the source package.

=== Buildout configuration ===

These days, most of the Python packages are available in [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs egg] format.  Buildout will download and install the eggs in directory and the location can be changed from the configuration file.  It is better to give a system-wide location for eggs directory.  And this configuration can be added to your system-wide configuration file.  The default configuration file for Buildout is ''~/.buildout/default.cfg''.  We are going to use ''eggs'' directory inside your home directory to keep all eggs downloaded, so first create those directories and file:

&lt;source lang=text&gt;
$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir .buildout
$ mkdir eggs
$ touch .buildout/default.cfg
&lt;/source&gt;

You can add the following to your ''~/.buildout/default.cfg'' file:

&lt;source lang=text&gt;
[buildout]
newest = false
eggs-directory = /home/baiju/eggs
find-links = http://download.zope.org/ppix
&lt;/source&gt;

The ''eggs-directory'' is where Buildout stores the eggs that are downloaded.  The last option, ''find-links'' points to a reliable mirror of the Python Package Index (PyPI).  The default configurations given above will be available to all buildouts in your system.

=== MS Windows notes ===

----
'''FIXME''': Add any specific things required for MS Windows here.
----

== Setting up development sandbox ==

To demonstrate the concepts, tools and techniques, we are going to develop a simple ticket/issue tracking application named ''Ticket Collector''.  To begin the work, first create a directory for the project.  After creating the directory, create a ''buildout.cfg'' file as given below.  To bootstrap this application checkout
''bootstrap.py'' and run it inside that directory.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ mkdir ticketcollector
$ cd ticketcollector
$ echo &quot;#Buildout configuration&quot; &gt; buildout.cfg
$ svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zc.buildout/trunk/bootstrap
$ ~/usr/bin/python2.4 bootstrap/bootstrap.py
&lt;/source&gt;

You can see a ''buildout'' script created inside ''bin'' directory.  Now onwards, you can run this script when changing Buildout configuration.

{{info|
You can save ''bootstrap.py'' in a local repository.  If you are using svn for managing repository, create an svn:external to the svn URL given above.
}}

Our application is basically a Python package.  First we will create an ''src'' directory to place our package.  Inside the ''src'' directory, you can create ''ticketcollector'' Python package.  You can create the ''src'' and the ''ticketcollector'' package like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ mkdir src
$ mkdir src/ticketcollector
$ echo &quot;#Python package&quot; &gt; src/ticketcollector/__init__.py 
&lt;/source&gt;

To start building our package you have to create a ''setup.py'' file.  The ''setup.py'' should have the minimum details as given below:

We have included bare minimum packages required for installation here: ''zope.app.zcmlfiles'', ''zope.app.twisted'', ''zope.app.securitypolicy'' and ''setuptools''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='ticketcollector',
    version='0.1',

    packages=find_packages('src'),
    package_dir={'': 'src'},
  
    install_requires=['setuptools',
                      'zope.app.zcmlfiles',
                      'zope.app.twisted',
                      'zope.app.securitypolicy',
                      ],
    include_package_data=True,
    zip_safe=False,
    )
&lt;/source&gt;

Modify ''buildout.cfg'' as given below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
[buildout]
develop = .
parts = py

[py]
recipe = zc.recipe.egg
eggs = ticketcollector
interpreter = python
&lt;/source&gt;

Now run ''buildout'' script inside ''bin'' directory.  This will download all necessary eggs and install it.  So installing Zope is nothing but just setting up a ''buildout'' with ''setup.py'' with required packages ''install_requires'' for installation.  Unless you specified a ''parts'' section which use ''ticketcollector'' in some way, buildout will not download dependency packages.

== A simple application ==

=== Configuring application ===


We are going to continue the ''Ticket Collector'' application in this section.  In the last section when you run ''./bin/buildout'' command all necessary Zope 3 packages required for running our application is downloaded inside ''~/eggs'' directory.  Now to run the bare minimum Zope 3, we have to create ''Zope Configuration Markup Language'' (ZCML) file and extend the ''buildout.cfg'' with appropriate Buildout recipes.  We are going to use ''zc.zope3recipes:app'',''zc.zope3recipes:instance'' and ''zc.recipe.filestorage'' recipes for setting up our application.  Here is our modified ''buildout.cfg'' (inside the ''ticketcollector'' project directory):

&lt;source lang=&quot;INI&quot;&gt;
[buildout]
develop = .
parts = ticketcollectorapp instance

[zope3]
location =

[ticketcollectorapp]
recipe = zc.zope3recipes:app
site.zcml = 
  &lt;include package=&quot;ticketcollector&quot; file=&quot;application.zcml&quot; /&gt;
eggs = ticketcollector

[instance]
recipe = zc.zope3recipes:instance
application = ticketcollectorapp
zope.conf = ${database:zconfig}

[database]
recipe = zc.recipe.filestorage
&lt;/source&gt;

Then we will create ''application.zcml'' inside ''src/ticketcollector'' directory with the following text.  Consider it as boiler plate code now, we will explain this in details later:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;configure
  xmlns=&quot;http://namespaces.zope.org/zope&quot;
  &gt;

  &lt;include package=&quot;zope.app.securitypolicy&quot; file=&quot;meta.zcml&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;include package=&quot;zope.app.zcmlfiles&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;include package=&quot;zope.app.authentication&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;include package=&quot;zope.app.securitypolicy&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;include package=&quot;zope.app.twisted&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;securityPolicy 
    component=&quot;zope.app.securitypolicy.zopepolicy.ZopeSecurityPolicy&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;role id=&quot;zope.Anonymous&quot; title=&quot;Everybody&quot;
    description=&quot;All users have this role implicitly&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;role id=&quot;zope.Manager&quot; title=&quot;Site Manager&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;role id=&quot;zope.Member&quot; title=&quot;Site Member&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;grant permission=&quot;zope.View&quot;
    role=&quot;zope.Anonymous&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;grant permission=&quot;zope.app.dublincore.view&quot;
    role=&quot;zope.Anonymous&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;grantAll role=&quot;zope.Manager&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;unauthenticatedPrincipal
    id=&quot;zope.anybody&quot;
    title=&quot;Unauthenticated User&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;unauthenticatedGroup
    id=&quot;zope.Anybody&quot;
    title=&quot;Unauthenticated Users&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;authenticatedGroup
    id=&quot;zope.Authenticated&quot;
    title=&quot;Authenticated Users&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;everybodyGroup
    id=&quot;zope.Everybody&quot;
    title=&quot;All Users&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;principal
    id=&quot;zope.manager&quot;
    title=&quot;Manager&quot;
    login=&quot;admin&quot;
    password_manager=&quot;Plain Text&quot;
    password=&quot;admin&quot;
    /&gt;

  &lt;grant
    role=&quot;zope.Manager&quot;
    principal=&quot;zope.manager&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/configure&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Running application ===

Now you can run the application by running ''./bin/buildout'' command followed by ''./bin/instance'' command.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ ./bin/buildout
$ ./bin/instance fg
&lt;/source&gt;

So, to run a Zope 3 application we have to use ''buildout'' recipes with proper configurations.

=== Using ZMI ===

After running your instance, If you open a web browser and go to ''http://localhost:8080'' you'll see the ZMI (''Zope Management Interface'').

Go ahead and click the ''Login'' link at the upper right.  Enter the user name and password as ''admin'', which is given in ''applications.zcml''.  Now click on ''[top]'' under Navigation on the right.  Play around with adding some content objects (the Zope 3 name for instances that are visible in the ZMI). Note how content objects can be arranged in a hierarchy by adding ''folders'' which are special content objects that can hold other content objects.

There is nothing special about the ZMI, it is just the default skin for Zope 3.  You can modify it to your liking, or replace it entirely.

When you're done exploring with the ZMI, go back to the window where you typed ''./bin/instance fg'' and press Control-C to stop Zope 3.

=== Hello world ===

Now you can begin your development inside ''src/ticketcollector'' directory.  Create a ''browser.py'' with following content:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from zope.publisher.browser import BrowserView

class HelloView(BrowserView):

    def __call__(self):
        return &quot;&quot;&quot;
        &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
          &lt;title&gt;Hello World&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
          Hello World
        &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Now append the following text just above the last line of ''application.zcml'':

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;browser:page
  for=&quot;*&quot;
  name=&quot;hello&quot;
  permission=&quot;zope.Public&quot;
  class=&quot;ticketcollector.browser.HelloView&quot;
/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see above, we are using ''page'' attribute from the ''browser'' namespace.  So, you have to include that namespace in the beginning ZCML as shown below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;configure
   xmlns=&quot;http://namespaces.zope.org/zope&quot;
   xmlns:browser=&quot;http://namespaces.zope.org/browser&quot;
   &gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

After restarting Zope, open ''http://localhost:8080/hello'', you can see that it displaying ''Hello World'' !.

== About Visual Localize ==
Visual Localize is a specialized tool for translating software and adapting the graphical user interface (GUI). Visual Localize is not a machine translation tool. Visual Localize as a computer aided translation (CAT) tool will help a human translator to translate software files using the internal database. In addition to this Visual Localize will help to prevent typical errors (e.g. truncated texts, non-unique usage of accelerators, ...) during the translation of software. 
Using a WYSIWYG editor to display all control elements on dialogs and menus allows the translator to see the context. Visual Localize enables translators to translate software applications (various software specific modules such as EXE, DLL (Win32 / .NET), OCX, XML, CHM, INI, RC, RESX, RESOURCES,.. etc.) into any language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This example shows how to use the ''i2c'' and ''i2c_stream_read'' programs with an extension board for the Khepera III robot. The extension board used here is the odor sensor board developed by [http://disal.epfl.ch DISAL]. With its tree VOC sensors, this board allows to measure the concentration of alcohol (or other substances) in the air. The sensors are internally sampled at several kHz, and the board integrates (averages) them over a certain period to provide a few samples per second to the outside world.

The interface to the outside world is an I2C bus, connected to the main CPU on the Khepera III robot. Over this I2C bus, the board can be configured and samples can be read in two different modes:
* In '''snapshot mode''', the board returns the last acquired value for each sensor.
* In '''streaming mode''', the board sends each sample exactly once. I.e., once streaming is started, the board buffers the samples in its internal memory. This buffer has to be read (and emptied) continuously in order to avoid buffer overruns.

In this example, we will configure the integration interval and read the samples both in '''snapshot''' and '''streaming''' mode. This is all done manually with the general-purpose ''i2c'' and ''i2c_stream_read'' programs. Of course, if one needs to do this more frequently, it is advisable to write a separate program for these tasks.

== Setup ==

Boot a Khepera III robot (equipped with an odor sensor board) and make sure it is [[Khepera III Toolbox/Network Setup|connected]] to your computer. In the remainder of this chapter, we assume that your robot is connected via USB.

Copy the I2C programs onto the robot
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
computer&gt; cd Programs
computer&gt; k3put +usb i2c i2c_stream_read
&lt;/source&gt;
You are now ready to work with the odor board.

== Configuring the integration interval ==

The odor board is a register based device with I2C address 0x50. The integration interval is stored in an 8-bit register at address 0x90.

First, let us read this register by issuing the following command:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
robot&gt; ./i2c 0x50 write 0x90 read 1
$DATA,1,2,write 90,read 0a
&lt;/source&gt;
The output may look a bit cryptic at first glance, but it is actually very simple to read. The above message simply says that 2 messages have been transmitted on the I2C bus. The first message was a write message with a single byte (0x90), and the second message was a read message with a single byte (0x0a). This last byte is obviously the content of the register, and translates to 10 in decimal notation.

Hence, our current integration interval is 10. Note that the odor board actually uses a power-of-two scale for this interval, i.e. setting the interval to 9 would produce twice as many samples per second.

10 is quite slow, though - let's set the interval to 8, which is 4 times faster. To write that register, we simply transmit this new value after the register number:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
robot&gt; ./i2c 0x50 write 0x90 8
$DATA,1,1,write 90 08
&lt;/source&gt;
Operation confirmed! One message was sent, containing two bytes (0x90, 0x08). Just to make sure that the new value has been accepted and stored in the register, let us read the register again:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
robot&gt; ./i2c 0x50 write 0x90 read 1
$DATA,1,2,write 90,read 08
&lt;/source&gt;
Everything looks all right.

=== Reading the last value (snapshot mode) ===

The odor board stores the last acquired sample in register 0x92 (read-only). A sample actually consists of one value for each sensor, plus a timestamp derived from the internal oscillator on the odor board. All values are 16-bit and therefore require 2 bytes, totaling to a register size of 8 bytes.

To read this register, we will issue the following command:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
robot&gt; ./i2c 0x50 write 0x92 read 8
$DATA,1,2,write 92,read 6b ... TODO
&lt;/source&gt;
The received message is to be interpreted as follows:
- Sensor 1: 
- Sensor 2: 
- Sensor 3: 
- Timestamp: 0x6b 0x0d -&gt; 107 + 13 * 256 = 3435

This '''snapshot mode''' mode is very handy if one only needs to request a sample every now and then, e.g. to take a decision whether or not the odor concentration has exceeded a certain threshold or not. However, if you want to plot the evolution of the odor concentration, you may want to query the board all the time for new values. If you do that too often, you may obtain the same sample several times. This is an effect that can be easily demonstrated with:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
robot&gt; ./i2c -r 100 -d 0x50 write 0x92 read 8
&lt;/source&gt;
which does the same as above, but 100 times in a row. The output may look like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
TODO
&lt;/source&gt;
In this example, every sample has been transmitted about N (TODO) times, but this will depend upon the load of the CPU and the I2C bus.

=== Reading a stream of samples (streaming mode) ===

To get a consistent picture of the evolution of the odor concentration, it is advisable to &quot;stream&quot; the samples in a way that each sample is transmitted exactly once.

The odor board indeed provides a VOC streaming register (0x93). Reading this register with the ''i2c'' program is a bit painful, though, because streaming requires several (different) messages to be sent.

Fortunately, there is this other program - ''i2c_stream_read'' - which does all that automatically. This program takes as arguments the I2C device address (0x50), the streaming register (0x93) and the block length (8):
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
robot&gt; ./i2c_stream_read 0x50 stream 0x93 8
&lt;/source&gt;
and will return something like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$BLOCK,0,1,A1 32 30 00 30 20 61
$BLOCK,1,1,BC 30 30 00 30 EB 52
$BLOCK,2,1,BD 31 30 00 30 64 54
$BLOCK,3,1,BE 32 30 00 30 D8 54
$BLOCK,4,1,BF 32 30 00 30 6B 53
$BLOCK,5,1,C0 31 30 00 30 9F 52
...
&lt;/source&gt;
Each line corresponds to an 8-byte data block that has been transmitted. The first byte of the block is a status byte indicating the number of samples remaining in the buffer (including the currently transmitted sample) and is printed in the second column (all 1's here). The 7 data bytes - printed in hex notation - make up the last column.

The odor sensor values are coded in the last 6 data bytes of each block. E.g., in the block we got the following values:
- Sensor 1: 
- Sensor 2: 
- Sensor 3:

== Plotting odor samples ==

To plot the evolution of the odor concentration, we just need to convert the output of the ''i2c_stream_read'' program into something that Matlab can read, and plot it there afterwards.

First, let us launch the program from a computer and redirect the output into a file:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
computer&gt; ssh root@192.168.1.2 &quot;/root/your_username/i2c_stream_read 0x50 0x93 8&quot; &gt; odor_stream
&lt;/source&gt;
Once you feel you've collected enough samples, press Ctrl-C to stop the program.

Use ''parse_stream.pl'' to convert the samples into a text file with tab-separated values, i.e.
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
computer&gt; ./parse_stream &lt; odor_stream &gt; matlab_odor_stream
&lt;/source&gt;

Finally, launch Matlab and type
&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt; plot_odor
&lt;/source&gt;
This Matlab script (m-file) will load the ''matlab_odor_stream'' file and plot the three curves.

[[File:Fleischschnacka.JPG|thumb|400px|''Fleischnacka'' served with a bit of broth and green salad.]]
'''''Fleischnacka''''' or '''''Fleischschnacka''''',&lt;ref&gt;Though {{wp|Alsace}} is a small region of France, its dialect varies pretty much between areas.&lt;/ref&gt; literally ''&quot;snails of meat&quot;'' (from German ''&quot;Fleisch&quot;'', ''meat'', and ''&quot;Schnecke&quot;'', ''snail'') is an Alsatian dish consisting of minced beef (or sometimes other meats, like left over [[Cookbook:Pot-au-feu|pot-au-feu]]) rolled in fresh noodle dough and cut into slices which are then cooked in stock.

==Ingredients==
For the dough:
*1 lb. [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
*4 ea. eggs
*salt
*1 cup water

For the filling:
*2½ lb. minced beef
*1 large onion
*3 cloves garlic
*nutmeg
*salt and pepper
*Oil
*2 pints beef stock
*4 cups Riesling (optional)

== Procedure ==
Preparation of the dough:
#Mix together the flour and eggs, add the water and salt.
#Knead the dough until smooth and set aside for 1 hour.
#Mince the onion, parsley and garlic.  Mix into the minced meat along with the eggs, nutmeg, salt and pepper.
#Roll out the dough into a rectangle.
#Spread the filling evenly over the dough and roll up into a cylinder.Seal the edge with water and cut into slices (not too thick).
#Brown the slices in oil. 
#Add the stock (and wine if used) and cook for 20 minutes.
Serve with a green salad.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We know from experience that we arrive at the idea of fractions by merely considering the idea of the quotient of two integers. The motivation behind this is simply to arrive at a multiplicative inverse for every non-zero element. Thus, we can consider an integral domain R and construct its ''field of fractions''. However, we can also try to make this work for any commutative ring, even if it has zero divisors other than 0. There is a slight alteration required because we cannot define &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}\frac{c}{d}&lt;/math&gt; when bd=0. Thus, we must place restrictions in case b and d are zero divisors in the case of multiplication. In this case, it is called the ''localization of a ring.''

==Definitions==
A ''multiplicative'' subset of a commutative ring R is a subset that does not contain 0, does contain 1, and is closed under multiplication. Some examples of multiplicative sets are the set of nonzero elements of an integral domain, the set of elements of a commutative ring that are not zero divisors, and R\P where P is a prime ideal of the commutative ring R.

Let S be a multiplicative subset. We will consider the Cartesian product R×S. Define the equivalence relation on this product: (a,b)~(c,d) whenever there exists an s such that s(ad-bc)=0.

If it is an integral domain, then (a,b) could be regarded as a/b. Now to check that this is an equivalence relation, it is obvious that it is reflexive and symmetric. To prove that it is transitive, let (a,b)~(c,d) and let (c,d)~(e,f). Then there are elements s and t within S such that s(ad-bc)=0 and such that t(cf-de)=0. This implies that stfad-stfbc=0 and that sbtcf-sbtde=0. Adding the two, we get stfad-sbtde=0, or std(af-be)=0, implying that (a,b)~(e,f).

We can thus use these equivalence classes to define the fraction: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalence class containing (a,b).

Now we set this to be a ring. First, we define addition to be &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{d}=\frac{ad+bc}{bd}&lt;/math&gt; and multiplication to be &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d}=\frac{ac}{bd}&lt;/math&gt;. The additive identity is &lt;math&gt;\frac{0}{1}&lt;/math&gt; and the additive inverse is &lt;math&gt;\frac{-a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;. The multiplicative identity is simply &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now we prove below that it is indeed a ring:

==Theorem==
The set of fractions with addition and multiplication as defined is a commutative ring, and if R is an integral domain, then the fractions are also. And if additionally S is R\{0}, then the set of fractions is a field.

===Proof===
First, we note that
#&lt;math&gt;(\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d}) + \frac{e}{f} = \frac{ad + bc}{bd} + \frac{e}{f} = \frac{(ad+bc)f + bde}{bdf} = \frac{adf + b(cf+de)}{bdf} = \frac{a}{b} + \frac{cf+de}{df} = \frac{a}{b} + (\frac{c}{d} + \frac{e}{f})&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} + \frac{0}{1} = \frac{a \cdot 1 + b \cdot 0}{b \cdot 1} = \frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\forall c \in S : 1_R (0\cdot 1 - 0\cdot c) = 0 \Rightarrow \frac{0}{1} = \frac{0}{c} (*)&lt;/math&gt; and therefore &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} + \frac{-a}{b} = \frac{ab + b(-a)}{bb} = \frac{0}{bb} = \frac{0}{1}&lt;/math&gt;
, from which follows that &lt;math&gt;(R \times S, +)&lt;/math&gt; is a group.

It is abelian because of the definition of the sum in S and R is commutative.

Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;(R \times S, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is a monoid because
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1} \cdot \frac{a}{b} = \frac{1a}{1b} = \frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;
#and &lt;math&gt;(\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d}) \cdot \frac{e}{f} = \frac{ace}{bdf} = \frac{a}{b} \cdot (\frac{c}{d} \cdot \frac{e}{f})&lt;/math&gt;, where two (not difficult) intermediate steps are left to the reader.

And, also the distributive laws hold, because
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} \left( \frac{c}{d} + \frac{e}{f} \right) = \left( \frac{c}{d} + \frac{e}{f} \right) \frac{a}{b} = \frac{acf +ade}{bdf}&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{acf +ade}{bdf} = \frac{acbf + adbe}{bdfb} = \frac{ac}{bd} + \frac{ae}{bf}&lt;/math&gt;
, which shows that we have indeed found a ring.

The ring is commutative because of the definition of the product in S R is commutative.

Let now R be an integral domain, and let &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}, \frac{c}{d} \in S&lt;/math&gt;.
Then, because of &lt;math&gt;(*)&lt;/math&gt; and since &lt;math&gt;bd \in S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} = 0 \Leftrightarrow \frac{ac}{bd} = 0 \Leftrightarrow \frac{ac}{bd} = \frac{0}{bd} \Leftrightarrow \exists s \in S: s(ac\cdot bd - 0 \cdot bd) = sacbd = 0&lt;/math&gt;. But since R was assumed to be an integral domain, and &lt;math&gt;s, b, d \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;s, b, d \in S&lt;/math&gt;, the last statement is exactly equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\exists s \in S: a = 0 \vee c = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which is in turn equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\exists s \in S: sab = s(ab - 0c) = 0 \vee \exists s \in S: scd = s(cd - 0d) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and this is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} = 0 \vee \frac{c}{d} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which shows that the fraction set is an integral domain if R is one.

Let's assume now that S = R \ {0}, and let &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} \neq 0 \Leftrightarrow a \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, where the last equivalence is due to (*) and &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} = 0 \Leftrightarrow \exists s \in S: s(a1 - b0) = as1 = as = 0 \Leftrightarrow a=0&lt;/math&gt;, where the last equivalence is in turn due to the fact that R is an integral domain and S does not contain zero. Then &lt;math&gt;ab \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; due to the fact that R is an integral domain, and thereofore &lt;math&gt;ab \in S&lt;/math&gt; since S = R \ {0}, and &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{a} = \frac{ab}{ab}&lt;/math&gt;. But since &lt;math&gt;\forall s \in S: s(ab1 - ba1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\frac{ab}{ab} = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{a} = 1&lt;/math&gt; and therefore, by noting that we have assumed R to be commutative, we have that every element of R\{0} is invertible.

From this follows that the set of fractions is indeed a field, because we have already checked all field axioms, QED.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although there is a theory of non-commutative polynomial rings, it presents some difficulties and will not be treated on this page. Thus, we will work only with commutative rings for their polynomial rings.

The degree of a polynomial &lt;math&gt;a_0+a_1X+...+a_nX^n&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a field, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are polynomials of &lt;math&gt;R[X]&lt;/math&gt;, then we can divide &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; to get &lt;math&gt;f=gq+r&lt;/math&gt;. However, we can also do this for any arbitrary ring if the leading coefficient of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is 1.

==2. Identify from pictures or personal observation ten tropical fishes.&lt;br&gt; a. Explain their breeding habits.&lt;br&gt; b. Give the habitat or country in which they are found.==
===Neon Tetra===
{{Species id
| common_name = Neon Tetra
| latin_name = Paracheirodon innesi
| image =Neonka obecna paracheirodon innesi.jpg
| caption = 
| description = The Neon Tetra has a dark olive-green back over a silver-white abdomen. The fish is characterized by an iridescent blue horizontal stripe along each side of the fish from its nose to the base of the adipose fin, and an iridescent red stripe that begins at the middle of the body and extends posteriorly to the base of the caudal fin. During the night, the color disappears as the fish rests—it reactivates once it becomes active in the morning. It grows to approximately 3 cm (1.25 in) in overall length. Sexual dimorphism is slight, the female having a slightly larger belly.
| range = The Neon Tetra is native to blackwater or clearwater streams in southeastern Colombia, eastern Peru, and western Brazil, including the tributaries of the Solimões. Fish are collected in warm-flowing (21–29°C) clear and blackwater streams, but never in whitewater rivers of Andean origin. 
| reproduction = To breed Neon Tetras, place a pair of the species in a breeding tank without any light, and gradually increase the lighting until spawning occurs. Other inducers include mosquito larvae and a hardness of less than 4 degrees. Some also recommend letting the level of nitrates rise, then do at least 50% water change to simulate the fresh rain the tetras get in their natural habitat, the Amazon. It is recommended that everything you place in the aquarium be sterilized, as well as the aquarium top. Because the adults will often eat newly-hatched fry, it is best to remove them as soon as the eggs have been laid. The eggs are especially sensitive to light. Eggs will hatch within 24 hours of the laying. Fry can be fed rotifers, especially infusoria and egg yolk for 1 to 4 weeks, followed by nauplii of brine shrimp, shaved cattle liver, and formulated diets. Fry will achieve their adult coloration at approximately one month of age. Adults can spawn every two weeks.
}}

===Afra Cichlid===
{{Species id
| common_name = Afra Cichlid
| latin_name = Cynotilapia afra
| image =C afra.jpg
| caption = 
| description = The afra cichlid has an elongate body typically with vertical blue and black bars. However, there are many different colorations depending on the region the fish is from, for example, the male fish from Kobwe have greenish stripes on blue-black body. They can grow up to 10 cm. Like many other cichlid from Lake Malawi, afra cichlids are mouthbrooders. Males defend boulders as their territories and feed from algae on those boulders. Females congregate in mid-water and feed from plankton.
| range = This fish is endemic to the central and northern parts of Lake Malawi and is found in rocky habitats.
| reproduction = Like many mbuna cichlids, this is a notoriously aggressive fish that should be kept in a species or mbuna tank. The best practice is to keep one male with several females. They should be provided with large spaces with plenty of hiding shelters.
}}

===Angel Fish===
{{Species id
| common_name = Angel Fish
| latin_name = Pterophyllum spp.
| image =Pterophyllum altum.jpg
| caption = 
| description = The three species of Pterophyllum are unusually shaped for cichlids being greatly laterally compressed, with round bodies and elongated triangular-shaped dorsal and anal fins. This body shape allows them to hide among roots and plants, often on a vertical surface. Naturally occurring angelfish are frequently striped longitudinally, colouration which provides additional camouflage. Angelfish are ambush predators and prey on small fish and macroinvertebrates. All Pterophyllum species form monogamous pairs. Eggs are generally laid on a submerged log or a flattened leaf. As is the case for other cichlids, brood care is highly developed.
| range = All Pterophyllum species originate from the Amazon River basin in tropical South America.
| reproduction = ''P. scalare'' is relatively easy to breed in the aquarium, although one of the results of generations of inbreeding is that many breeds have almost completely lost their rearing instincts resulting in the tendency of the parents to eat their young. In addition, it is very difficult to accurately identify the gender of any individual until they are nearly ready to breed.

Angelfish pairs form long-term relationships where each individual will protect the other from threats and potential suitors. Upon the death or removal of one of the mated pair, some breeders have experienced a total refusal of the other mate to pair up with any other angelfish; others have had more success with subsequent mates. Both parents care for the young.

Depending upon aquarium conditions, P. scalare reaches sexual maturity at the age of six to twelve months or more. In situations where the eggs are removed from the aquarium immediately after spawning, the pair is capable of spawning every seven to ten days. Around the age of approximately three years, spawning frequency will decrease and eventually cease.

When the pair is ready to spawn, they will choose an appropriate medium upon which to lay the eggs and spend one to two days picking off detritus and algae from the surface. This medium may be a broad-leaf plant in the aquarium, a flat surface such as a piece of slate placed vertically in the aquarium, a length of pipe, or even the glass sides of the aquarium. The female will deposit a line of eggs on the spawning substrate, followed by the male who will fertilize the eggs. This process will repeat itself until there are a total of 100 to up to 1200+ eggs, depending on the size and health of the female fish. The pair will take turns maintaining a high rate of water circulation around the eggs by swimming very close to the eggs and fanning the eggs with their pectoral fins. In a few days, the eggs hatch and the fry remain attached to the spawning substrate. During this period, the fry will not eat and will survive by consuming the remains of their yolk sacs. At one week, the fry will detach and become free-swimming. Successful parents will keep close watch on the eggs until they become free-swimming. At the free-swimming stage, the fry can be fed newly-hatched frozen och fresh (i.e. alive) brine shrimp (Artemia spp.).
}}

===Discus===
{{Species id
| common_name = Discus
| latin_name = Symphysodon spp.
| image = Blue Discus.jpg
| caption = 
| description = Like cichlids from the genus Pterophyllum, all Symphysodon species have a laterally compressed body shape. In contrast to Pterophyllum, however, extended finnage is absent giving Symphysodon a more rounded shape. It is this body shape from which their common name, “discus”, is derived. The sides of the fish are frequently patterned in shades of green, red, brown, and blue. The height and length of the grown fish are both about {{units|20–25 cm|8–10 in}}.
| range = Discus (''Symphysodon spp.'') are a genus of three species of freshwater cichlid fishes native to the Amazon River basin
| reproduction = Another characteristic of Symphysodon species is the way they care for their larvae. As for most cichlids, brood care is highly developed with both the parents caring for the young. Additionally, adult discus produce a secretion through their skin, off which the larvae live during their first few days. This behaviour has also been observed for Uaru species.
}}

===Gold Barb===
{{Species id
| common_name = Gold Barb
| latin_name = Puntius semifasciolatus
| image =Gold Barb Puntius semifasciolatus 6.png
| caption = 
| description = The gold barb is a medium-long barb. Adults have highly arched backs and a short pair of barbels on the upper jaw at the corners of the mouth. The back is light to reddish brown, the sides are metallic green or yellow-green, with a brassy or golden sheen below. The belly is whitish, turning orange-red in males at mating time. Females can be distinguished by their dull colors and their overall bulk. The average size of adults is {{units|7 - 8 cm|2.75 to 3 inches}}.
| range = Its native habitat is the Red River basin in southeast China. 
| reproduction = An egg-scatterer, adult barbs will spawn around a hundred eggs. This breeding occurs at the first light in the early morning.
}}

===Guppy===
{{Species id
| common_name = Guppy 
| latin_name = Poecilia reticulata
| image =Guppy-Male-and-Female.JPG
| caption = 
| description = The guppy (Poecilia reticulata) is one of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish species in the world. It is a small member of the Poecilidae family (females 4-6 centimeters long, males 2½–3½ centimeters long) and like all other members of the family, is live-bearing.
| range = Guppies are native to Trinidad and parts of South America, specifically Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Brazil, Guyana, Netherlands Antilles, Trinidad and Tobago, the US Virgin Islands, and Venezuela.
| reproduction = Guppies are highly prolific livebearers. The gestation period of a guppy is 22-30 days, with an average of 28 days. After the female guppy is inseminated, a dark area near the anus, known as the gravid spot, will enlarge and darken. Guppies prefer water temperatures of about {{units|28 °C|82 °F}} for reproduction. The female guppy drops of between 2-100 fry, typically ranging between 30 and 60. After giving birth, the female is ready for conception again within only a few hours.
}}

===Molly===
{{Species id
| common_name = Molly
| latin_name = Poecilia sphenops
| image =Black molly.jpg
| caption = 
| description = This species is one of the most well-known aquarium fishes and nearly as easy to keep and prolific as guppies (for optimal health and breeding success, they demand fresh vegetable food like algae). There are several other popular breeds, like the golden molly nicknamed &quot;24 karat&quot;, or the balloon molly, which however has a deformed spine and a decreased lifespan due to the associated health problems. Also, breeds with altered caudal fin structures like lyretails exist. The wild form is in fact quite rarely kept, as it has a rather plain silvery coloration suffused with brown and green hues. If given good care with ample sunlight, high water temperatures and fresh vegetables, they will, however, prove charming fish who make up for their somewhat plain coloration with their lively behavior.
| range = Mollies inhabit the coastal brackish and marine waters of Mexico. 
| reproduction = Fertilization is internal and is accomplished by means of highly modified fin elements within the anal fin of males that form a structure known as the gonopodium. Sailfin mollies produce broods of 10-140 live young, depending upon maturity and size, and females may store sperm long after the demise of their relatively short-lived mates. The gestation period for this species is approximately 3-4 weeks, depending upon temperature, and a single female may give birth on multiple occasions throughout the year. Although sex ratios of the broods are balanced, adult populations tend to be largely female as males appear to suffer higher rates of mortality due to a greater susceptibility to predators and disease as a consequence of their brighter colours and a life devoted to frenzied breeding. There is no parental care exhibited by this species.
}}

===Betta===

{{Species id
| common_name = Betta
| latin_name = Betta
| image =Betta albimarginata 060311 8.jpg
| caption = 
| description = Betta Bleeker, 1850 is a large genus of small, often colorful, freshwater ray-finned fishes.  All the Betta species are small fishes, but they vary considerably in size, ranging from under 2.5 cm (1 inch) total length in B. chanoides to 14 cm (5.5 inches) in the Akar betta (B. akarensis).[1]

Bettas are anabantoids, which means they can breathe atmospheric air thanks to a unique organ called the labyrinth. This accounts for their ability to thrive in low-oxygen water conditions that would kill most other fish, such as rice paddies, slow-moving streams, drainage ditches, and large puddles.
| range = The Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) is one of the most popular species of freshwater aquarium fish. It is native to the Mekong river basin in Southeast Asia.
| reproduction = The various bettas can be divided into two groups, based on their spawning behavior: some build bubble nests, like B. splendens, while others are mouthbrooders, like B. picta. The mouthbrooding species are sometimes called &quot;pseudo bettas&quot;.
}}
===Goby===
{{Species id
| common_name = Goby
| latin_name = Elacatinus
| image =Elacatinus evelynae.jpg
| caption = 
| description = Neon gobies are very small, torpedo-shaped fish. Although sizes vary slightly by species, they are generally about {{units|2.5 cm|1 inch}} long. They have dark bodies with iridescent stripes (the color of which varies by species) running from the tip of the nose to the base of the caudal fin. Like all gobies, their dorsal fin is split in two, the anterior dorsal fin being rounded like that of a clownfish and the posterior dorsal fin being relatively flat. The anal fin lines up with the posterior dorsal fin and is of similar shape. The pectoral fins are nearly circular, and, like all other fins, transparent.

They are well-documented cleaner fish, setting up stations where often much larger fish (sometimes even fish who would normally eat the gobies) come to have the gobies eat their small external parasites. This is an excellent example of symbiosis – the cleaned fish are healthier and the gobies have not only an excellent food source but also relative protection from potential predators.
| range = Neon gobies are native to the tropical reefs of the Gulf of Mexico, from Texas to Belize, where they live primarily in the rocks. 
| reproduction = If kept in pristine conditions and fed well neon gobies will readily spawn in home aquaria. A species or breeding tank is required, as the fry are small and will be eaten by most other fish. The gobies are sexually dimorphic, but the difference is not easy to ascertain so they are normally kept in large groups to ensure a balance of sexes. They will lay their eggs on any hard surface along the bottom, and the fry, which feed on small rotifers or other microscopic organisms, are fully developed within a month. The average lifespan for a neon goby is approximately a year to a year and a half.
}}
===Green Swordtail===
{{Species id
| common_name = Green Swordtail
| latin_name = Xiphophorus hellerii
| image =Xiphophorus helleri 02.jpg
| caption = 
| description = The male green swordtail grows to a maximum overall length of {{units|14cm|5.5i}} and the female to {{units|16 cm|6.3 in}}. The name &quot;swordtail&quot; is commonly but mistakenly believed to be derived form the elongated lower lobe of the male's caudal fin (tailfin), but is actually derived from the sword shaped anal fin of the male. Sexual dimorphism is moderate, with the female being larger than the male but lacking the &quot;sword&quot;. The wild form is olive green in color, with a red or brown lateral stripe and speckles on the dorsal and, sometimes, caudal fins. The male's &quot;sword&quot; is yellow, edged in black below. Captive breeding has produced many color varieties, including black, red, and many patterns thereof, for the aquarium hobby.
| range = It is native to an area of North and Central America stretching from Veracruz, Mexico, to northwestern Honduras.
| reproduction = The males' elongated caudal fins have been found to significantly affect their chances at mating. The presence of a well-endowed male spurs the maturity of females while it inhibits the maturity of juvenile males in the vicinity as the well-endowed male.

==3. Identify from pictures or personal observation ten fishes native to your own country. Explain their feeding and breeding habits.==
The fish presented here are native to the United States and Canada.  
===Brook Trout===
{{Species id
| common_name = Brook Trout
| latin_name = Salvelinus fontinalis
| image =Salvelinus fontinalis.jpg
| caption = Brook Trout
| description = The brook trout is of dark green to brown basic coloration with a distinctive marbled pattern (called vermiculations) of lighter shades across the flanks and back and extending at least to the dorsal fin, and often to the tail. There is a distinctive sprinkling of red dots, surrounded by blue haloes, along the flank. The belly and lower fins are reddish in color, the latter with white leading edges. Often the belly, particularly of the males, becomes very red or orange when the fish are spawning. The species reaches a maximum recorded length of 86 cm (33 in) and a maximum recorded weight of 9.4 kg (21 lb). It can reach at least seven years of age, with reports of 15-year-old specimens observed in California habitats to which the species has been introduced.
| range = The brook trout is native to small streams, creeks, lakes, and spring ponds. Some brook trout are anadromous. It is native to a wide area of eastern North America but increasingly confined to higher elevations southward in the Appalachian Mountains to northern Georgia, Canada from the Hudson Bay basin east, the Great Lakes–Saint Lawrence system, and the upper Mississippi River drainage as far west as eastern Iowa.
| reproduction = Individuals normally spend their entire life in fresh water, but some — colloquially called &quot;salters&quot; or &quot;sea run&quot; — may spend up to three months at sea in the spring, not straying more than a few kilometers from the river mouth. The fish return upstream to spawn in the late summer or autumn. The female constructs a depression in a location in the stream bed, sometimes referred to as a &quot;redd&quot;, where groundwater percolates upward through the gravel. One or more males approaches the female, fertilizing the eggs as the female expresses them. The eggs are slightly more dense than water. The female then buries the eggs in a small gravel mound. The eggs hatch in approximately 100 days.
| diet = Its diverse diet includes crustaceans, frogs and other amphibians, insects, molluscs, smaller fish, and even small aquatic mammals such as voles.
}}
===Rainbow Trout===
{{Species id
| common_name = Rainbow Trout
| latin_name = Oncorhynchus mykiss
| image =Oncorhynchus mykiss mid res 150dpi.jpg
| caption = 
| description =  The rainbow trout are unusual in that there are two forms which sometimes share the same habitat. The anadromous (sea-going) form called &quot;steelhead&quot; migrate to the ocean, though they must return to fresh water to reproduce.  The freshwater form is called &quot;rainbow trout&quot;, based on the broad red band along their sides. Steelhead are exactly the same species as rainbow trout. However, the difference is anadromy. After going to sea, their color changes, including loss of the red band. They stay at sea for 1-4 years, and return to fresh water to spawn. Rainbows stay in fresh water their whole lives.  Rainbows and steelhead occur in well-oxygenated lakes and streams where the temperature normally doesn't rise above 12°C in summer. 

Rainbows range from 12 to 36 inches in length. Steelhead grow longer, ranging from 50 to 122 cm (20 to 48 inches) in length. Steelhead range in weight from 2.5 kg to 10 kg (5.5 - 22 pounds).
| range = The rainbow trout is a species of salmonid native to tributaries of the Pacific Ocean in Asia and North America as well as much of the central, western, eastern, and especially the northern portions of the United States.
| reproduction = Unlike other Pacific Salmon, rainbow trout and steelhead do not necessarily die after spawning (they may spawn as many as four times).
| diet =Rainbow trout have a varied diet. They are predators, eating any smaller fish from nearly the time they are born. Insects make up a large portion of the diet, along with crayfish and other crustaceans, some lake dwelling species may become planktonic feeders. Trout of all ages will eat nearly anything they can grab, in contrast with the legendary, selective nature the fish often gets. They are near the top of the food chain in most freshwater environments. However they are lower on the rung of other freshwater predators such as pike, muskie, lake trout, and chinook salmon. Rainbows will take fish up to and over 1/3 of their length and larger.

===Northern Pike===
{{Species id
| common_name = Northern Pike
| latin_name = Esox lucius
| image =Esox Lucius.JPG
| image_2 = Esox lucius1.jpg
| caption = 
| description = Northern pike are most often olive, shading into yellow to white along the belly. The flank is marked with short, light barlike spots and there are a few to many dark spots on the fins. The lower half of the gill cover lacks scales and they have large sensory pores on their head and on the underside of the lower jaw which are part of the lateral line system. Unlike the similar-looking and closely related muskellunge, the northern pike has light markings on a dark body background and fewer than six sensory pores on the underside of each side of the lower jaw.
| range = E. lucius is found throughout the northern hemisphere, including Russia, Europe, the British Isles, and North America.
| reproduction = The Northern Pike spawns beneath the ice in the Spring.  A female is followed by four or five smaller males as she seeks vegetative cover in the shallows.  When the eggs are released and fertilized, the stick to the vegetation where they are abandoned by the parents.
| diet =Pike are typical ambush predators; they lie in wait for prey, holding perfectly still for long periods and then exhibit remarkable acceleration as they strike. The fish has a distinctive habit of catching its prey sideways in the mouth, killing or immobilizing it with its sharp teeth, and then turning the prey lengthwise to swallow it. It eats mainly fish, but on occasion water voles and ducklings have also been known to fall prey to pike. Pike will aggressively strike at any fish in the vicinity, even at other pike. Young pike have been found dead from choking on a pike of a similar size. Northern pike also feed on frogs, insects and leeches. It has often been suggested that pike optimally forage on prey that are from 25 to 35% of their body length. Also on rare occasions pike have been reported to have eaten young bald eagles.
}}

===Bluegill===
{{Species id
| common_name = Bluegill
| latin_name = Lepomis macrochirus
| image =Lepomis macrochirus photo.jpg
| caption = 
| description = The Bluegill is a species of freshwater fish sometimes referred to as bream, brim, or copper nose.  The bluegill's most notable feature is the blue or black &quot;ear&quot;, actually an extension of the gill cover called the opercular flap. Its name, however, comes from the bright blue edging visible on its gill rakers. It can be distinguished from similar species by the (not always pronounced) vertical bars along its flanks. The bluegill grows to a maximum overall length of approximately 40 cm (16 in).
| range = The bluegill is native to a wide area of North America, from Québec to northern Mexico, and has been widely transplanted to stock game fish for anglers. 
| reproduction = These fish spawn in June in nests in the shallows. During this period males assume a very bold coloration, as they are guarding their nests. An interesting aspect of their biology is that some males assume the coloration of the female fish so that the nest-guarding males won't show aggression towards them. Then these &quot;sneaker&quot; males enter nests and spawn.
| diet = The natural diet of the bluegill consists largely of small invertebrates and very small fish.
}}

===Smallmouth Bass===
{{Species id
| common_name = Smallmouth Bass
| latin_name = Micropterus dolomieu
| image =Micropterus dolomieu2.jpg
| caption = 
| description = The smallmouth bass is generally green with dark vertical bands rather than a horizontal band along the side. There are 13-15 soft rays in the dorsal fin. The upper jaw of smallmouth bass does not extend beyond the back of the eye.
| range = The smallmouth bass is native to the upper and middle Mississippi River basin, the Saint Lawrence River–Great Lakes system, and up into the Hudson Bay basin.
| reproduction = The female can lay up to 21,000,000 eggs, which are guarded by the male in his nest.
| diet =Carnivorous, its diet comprises crayfish, insects, and smaller fish, the young also feeding on zooplankton.
}}

===Largemouth Bass===
{{Species id
| common_name = Largemouth Bass
| latin_name = Micropterus salmoides
| image =Micropterus salmoides 2.jpg
| caption = 
| description = The largemouth is marked by a series of dark, sometimes black, blotches forming a jagged horizontal stripe along each flank. The upper jaw of a largemouth bass extends beyond the rear edge of the eye.
| range = Native to the central and southeastern United States, the largemouth bass has been introduced throughout most of the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/conn.river/smlgbass.html&lt;/ref&gt;
| reproduction = Spawning occurs in shallow areas of lakes and ponds in the spring. Males arrive first, selecting a territory on fine gravel, coarse sand or among sparse vegetation. The male will slightly clear, using his fins, a shallow depression into which he will entice a female to deposit her eggs. Females can lay up to a million eggs during each season. The male guards the embryos until the larvae hatch and then will continue to guard the &quot;fry&quot; until they disperse from the nest. During the guarding period, the male ferociously attacks any potential predators that approach too closely.
| diet =The juvenile largemouth bass consumes mostly zooplankton and insects. Adults consume small fish, crayfish, and frogs. Prey items can be as large as 25 to 35% of the bass's body length. Largemouth bass have even been reported to take small birds, small mammals, such as mice and rats and small snakes.
}}

===White Perch===
{{Species id
| common_name = White Perch
| latin_name = Morone americana
| image =White perch GLERL.jpg
| caption = 
| description = Generally silvery-white in color, hence the name, it has been reported up to 49.5 cm in length and weighing 2.2 kg.
| range = Although favoring brackish waters, it is also found in fresh water and coastal areas from the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario south to the Pee Dee River in South Carolina.
| reproduction = White perch are a prolific species. The female can deposit over 140,000 eggs in a spawning session, lasting just over a week. Several males will often attend a spawning female, and each may fertilize a portion of her eggs. The young hatch within 1 to 6 days of fertilization.
| diet =White perch are known to eat the eggs of many species native to the Great Lakes, such as walleye and other true perches. At times, fish eggs are 100% of its diet.
}}

===Black Crappie===
{{Species id
| common_name = Black Crappie
| latin_name = Pomoxis nigromaculatus
| image =Pomoxis nigromaculatus1.jpg
| caption = 
| description = The black crappue is most accurately identified by the seven or eight spines on its dorsal fin.
| range = The crappie is native throughout the eastern half of Canada and the United States, and has been widely introduced in the west as well. As of 2005, populations existed in all of the lower 48 states of the United States.
| reproduction = The breeding season varies by location, due to the species’ great range; breeding temperature is 14‒20 °C (58‒68 °F) and spawning occurs between April and June. Spawning occurs in a nest built by the male, who guards the eggs and young.
| diet =Adult crappies feed predominantly on smaller species, including the young of their own predators (which include the northern pike, muskellunge, and walleye). They have diverse diets, however, including zooplankton, insects, and crustaceans
}}

===Striped Bass===
{{Species id
| common_name = Striped Bass
| latin_name = Morone saxatilis
| image =StripedBass.JPG
| caption = 
| description = The striped bass is a typical member of the Moronidae family in shape, having a streamlined, silvery body marked with longitudinal dark stripes running from behind the gills to the base of the tail. Maximum size is 200 cm (6.6 ft) and maximum scientifically recorded weight 57 kg (125 US pounds). Striped bass are believed to live for up to 30 years.
| range = Striped bass are found along the Atlantic coastline of North America from the St. Lawrence River into the Gulf of Mexico to approximately Louisiana. They are anadromous fish that migrate between fresh and salt water. Spawning takes place in freshwater.
| reproduction = Striped bass spawn in freshwater and spend their adult lives in saltwater (i.e., it is anadromous). They can also live exclusively in freshwater and currently flourish in several inland water bodies.
| diet = Striped bass are primarily nocturnal feeders, eating insects, crustaceans, and other fish.

==4. Define the following parts of a fish:== 

[[Image:Lampanyctodes hectoris (Hector's lanternfish)2.png|thumb|350px|''Lampanyctodes hectoris'' &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;
(1) - operculum (gill cover), (2) - lateral line, (3) - dorsal fin, (4) - adipose fin, (5) - caudal peduncle, (6) - caudal fin, (7) - anal fin, (8) - photophores, (9) - pelvic fins (paired), (10) - pectoral fins (paired)&lt;/small&gt;]]
===a. Dorsal fin===
A dorsal fin is a fin located on the backs of fishes, whales, dolphins and porpoises, as well as the (extinct) ichthyosaurs. Its main purpose is to stabilize the animal against rolling and assist in sudden turns. Some animals have developed dorsal fins with protective functions, such as spines or venom. Many catfish can lock the leading ray of the dorsal fin in an extended position to discourage predation or to wedge themselves into a crevice.
Dorsal fins come in a variety of shapes and sizes.

===b. Pectoral fin===
The paired pectoral fins are located on each side, usually just behind the operculum, and are homologous to the forelimbs of tetrapods. A peculiar function of pectoral fins, highly developed in some fish, is the creation of the dynamic lifting force that assists, e.g., sharks, in maintaining depths and enables the flight for flying fish.

===c. Pelvic fin===
The paired pelvic or ventral fins are located ventrally below the pectoral fins. They are homologous to the hindlimbs of tetrapods.

===d. Anal fin===
The anal fin is located on the ventral surface behind the anus. This fin is used to stabilize the fish while swimming.

===e. Caudal fin===
The caudal fin is the tail fin, located at the end of the caudal peduncle.

=== f. Lateral line===
The lateral line is a sense organ used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water. It consists of a line of receptors running along each side of the fish.

=== g. Operculum===
The operculum of a bony fish is the hard bony flap covering and protecting the gills. In most fish, the rear edge of the operculum roughly marks the division between the head and the body. The operculum is composed of four bones; the opercle, preopercle, interopercle, and subopercle. The morphology of this anatomical feature varies greatly between species. For example, the bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) has a posteriorly and dorsally oriented rounded extension with a small black splotch present. In some species, the operculum can push water from the buccal cavity through the gills.
For some fish, the operculum is vital in obtaining oxygen. It opens as the mouth closes, causing the pressure inside the fish to drop. Water then flows towards the lower pressure across the fish's gill lamellae, allowing some oxygen to be absorbed from the water.
Cartilaginous fishes do not have an operculum. Without an operculum, other methods of getting water to the gills are required, such as ventilation.

=== h. Barbels ===
The head may have several fleshy structures known as barbels, which may be very long and resemble whiskers.

=== i. Swim bladder===
The gas bladder, or swim bladder, is an internal organ that contributes to the ability of a fish to control its buoyancy, and thus to stay at the current water depth, ascend, or descend without having to waste energy in swimming. It is often absent in fast swimming fishes such as the Tuna and Mackerel families.

===j. Gills===
The gills, located under the operculum, are a respiratory organ for the extraction of oxygen from water and for the excretion of carbon dioxide. They are not usually visible, but can be seen in some species e.g. the frilled shark.

==5. State briefly the proper care and feeding of fishes of: &lt;br&gt;a. Tropical zone &lt;br&gt;b. Temperate zone.==
Ideal aquarium ecology reproduces the balance found in nature in the closed system of an aquarium. In practice it is virtually impossible to maintain a perfect balance. As an example, a balanced predator-prey relationship is nearly impossible to maintain in even the largest of aquaria. Typically, an aquarium keeper must take steps to maintain balance in the small ecosystem contained in his aquarium.

Approximate balance is facilitated by large volumes of water. Any event that perturbs the system pushes an aquarium away from equilibrium; the more water that is contained in a tank, the easier such a systemic shock is to absorb, as the effects of that event are diluted. For example, the death of the only fish in a three U.S. gallon tank (11 L) causes dramatic changes in the system, while the death of that same fish in a 100 U.S. gallon (400 L) tank with many other fish in it represents only a minor change in the balance of the tank. For this reason, hobbyists often favor larger tanks when possible, as they are more stable systems requiring less intensive attention to the maintenance of equilibrium.

There are a variety of nutrient cycles that are important in the aquarium. Dissolved oxygen enters the system at the surface water-air interface or through the actions of an air pump. Carbon dioxide escapes the system into the air. The phosphate cycle is an important, although often overlooked, nutrient cycle. Sulfur, iron, and micronutrients also cycle through the system, entering as food and exiting as waste. Appropriate handling of the nitrogen cycle, along with supplying an adequately balanced food supply and considered biological loading, is usually enough to keep these other nutrient cycles in approximate equilibrium.
===Water conditions===The solute content of water is perhaps the most important aspect of water conditions, as total dissolved solids and other constituents can dramatically impact basic water chemistry, and therefore how organisms are able to interact with their environment. Salt content, or salinity, is the most basic classification of water conditions. An aquarium may have freshwater (salinity below 0.5 PPT), simulating a lake or river environment; brackish water (a salt level of 0.5 to 30 PPT), simulating environments lying between fresh and salt, such as estuaries; and salt water or seawater (a salt level of 30 to 40 PPT), simulating an ocean or sea environment. Rarely, even higher salt concentrations are maintained in specialized tanks for raising brine organisms.

Several other water characteristics result from dissolved contents of the water, and are important to the proper simulation of natural environments. The pH of the water is a measure of the degree to which it is alkaline or acidic. Saltwater is typically alkaline, while the pH of fresh water varies more. Hardness measures overall dissolved mineral content; hard or soft water may be preferred. Hard water is usually alkaline, while soft water is usually neutral to acidic. Dissolved organic content and dissolved gases content are also important factors.

Home aquarists typically use modified tap water supplied through their local water supply network to fill their tanks. Because of the chlorine used to disinfect drinking water supplies for human consumption, straight tap water cannot be used. In the past, it was possible to &quot;condition&quot; the water by simply letting the water stand for a day or two, which allows the chlorine time to dissipate. However, chloramine is now used more often as it is much stabler and will not leave the water as readily. Additives formulated to remove chlorine or chloramine are often all that is needed to make the water ready for aquarium use. Brackish or saltwater aquaria require the addition of a mixture of salts and other minerals, which are commercially available for this purpose.

More sophisticated aquarists may make other modifications to their base water source to modify the water's alkalinity, hardness, or dissolved content of organics and gases, before adding it to their aquaria. This can be accomplished by a range of different additives, such as sodium bicarbonate to raise pH. Some aquarists will even filter or purify their water prior to adding it to their aquarium. There are two processes used for that: deionization or reverse osmosis. In contrast, public aquaria with large water needs often locate themselves near a natural water source (such as a river, lake, or ocean) in order to have easy access to a large volume of water that does not require much further treatment.

The temperature of the water forms the basis of one of the two most basic aquarium classifications: tropical vs. cold water. Most fish and plant species tolerate only a limited range of water temperatures: Tropical or warm water aquaria, with an average temperature of about 25 °C (77 °F), are much more common, and tropical fish are among the most popular aquarium denizens. Cold water aquaria are those with temperatures below what would be considered tropical; a variety of fish are better suited to this cooler environment. More importantly than the temperature range itself is the consistency in temperature; most organisms are not accustomed to sudden changes in temperatures, which could cause shock and lead to disease. Water temperature can be regulated with a combined thermometer and heater unit (or, more rarely, with a cooling unit).

Water movement can also be important in accurately simulating a natural ecosystem. Aquarists may prefer anything from still water up to swift simulated currents in an aquarium, depending on the conditions best suited for the aquarium's inhabitants. Water movement can be controlled through the use of aeration from air pumps, powerheads, and careful design of internal water flow (such as location of filtration system points of inflow and outflow).

===Nitrogen cycle===
Of primary concern to the aquarist is management of the biological waste produced by an aquarium's inhabitants. Fish, invertebrates, fungi, and some bacteria excrete nitrogen waste in the form of ammonia (which will convert to ammonium, in acidic water) and must then pass through the nitrogen cycle. Ammonia is also produced through the decomposition of plant and animal matter, including fecal matter and other detritus. Nitrogen waste products become toxic to fish and other aquarium inhabitants at high concentrations.
====The Process====
A well-balanced tank contains organisms that are able to metabolize the waste products of other aquarium residents. The nitrogen waste produced in a tank is metabolized in aquaria by a type of bacteria known as nitrifiers (genus Nitrosomonas). Nitrifying bacteria capture ammonia from the water and metabolize it to produce nitrite. Nitrite is also highly toxic to fish in high concentrations. Another type of bacteria, genus Nitrospira, converts nitrite into nitrate, a less toxic substance to aquarium inhabitants. (Nitrobacter bacteria were previously believed to fill this role, and continue to be found in commercially available products sold as kits to &quot;jump start&quot; the nitrogen cycle in an aquarium. While biologically they could theoretically fill the same niche as Nitrospira, it has recently been found that Nitrobacter are not present in detectable levels in established aquaria, while Nitrospira are plentiful.) This process is known in the aquarium hobby as the nitrogen cycle.

In addition to bacteria, aquatic plants also eliminate nitrogen waste by metabolizing ammonia and nitrate. When plants metabolize nitrogen compounds, they remove nitrogen from the water by using it to build biomass. However, this is only temporary, as the plants release nitrogen back into the water when older leaves die off and decompose.
====Maintaining the Tank====
Although informally called the nitrogen cycle by hobbyists, it is in fact only a portion of a true cycle: nitrogen must be added to the system (usually through food provided to the tank inhabitants), and nitrates accumulate in the water at the end of the process, or become bound in the biomass of plants. This accumulation of nitrates in home aquaria requires the aquarium keeper to remove water that is high in nitrates, or remove plants which have grown from the nitrates.

Aquaria kept by hobbyists often do not have the requisite populations of bacteria needed to detoxify nitrogen waste from tank inhabitants. This problem is most often addressed through two filtration solutions: Activated carbon filters absorb nitrogen compounds and other toxins from the water, while biological filters provide a medium specially designed for colonization by the desired nitrifying bacteria. Activated carbon and other substances, such as ammonia absorbing resins, will stop working when their pores get full, so these components have to be replaced with fresh stocks constantly.

New aquaria often have problems associated with the nitrogen cycle due to insufficient number of beneficial bacteria, known as the &quot;New Tank Syndrome&quot;. Therefore, new tanks have to be &quot;matured&quot; before stocking them with fish. There are three basic approaches to this: the fishless cycle, the silent cycle, and slow growth.

No fish are kept in a tank undergoing a fishless cycle. Instead, small amounts of ammonia are added to the tank to feed the bacteria being cultured. During this process, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels are tested to monitor progress. The silent cycle is basically nothing more than densely stocking the aquarium with fast-growing aquatic plants and relying on them to consume the nitrogen, allowing the necessary bacterial populations time to develop. According to anecdotal reports of aquarists specializing in planted tanks, the plants can consume nitrogenous waste so efficiently that the spikes in ammonia and nitrite levels normally seen in more traditional cycling methods are greatly reduced, if they are detectable at all. More commonly slow growth entails slowly increasing the population of fish over a period of 6 to 8 weeks, giving bacteria colonies time to grow and stabilize with the increase in fish waste.

The largest bacterial populations are found in the filter; efficient filtration is vital. Sometimes, a vigorous cleaning of the filter is enough to seriously disturb the biological balance of an aquarium. Therefore, it is recommended to rinse mechanical filters in an outside bucket of aquarium water to dislodge organic materials that contribute to nitrate problems, while preserving bacteria populations. Another safe practice consists of cleaning only one half of the filter media every time the filter or filters are serviced.
===Biological Loading===
Biological loading is a measure of the burden placed on the aquarium ecosystem by its living inhabitants. High biological loading in an aquarium represents a more complicated tank ecology, which in turn means that equilibrium is easier to perturb. In addition, there are several fundamental constraints on biological loading based on the size of an aquarium. The surface area of water exposed to air limits dissolved oxygen intake by the tank. The capacity of nitrifying bacteria is limited by the physical space they have available to colonize. Physically, only a limited size and number of plants and animals can be fit into an aquarium while still providing room for movement.
====Calculating aquarium capacity====
An aquarium can only support a certain number of fish. Limiting factors include the availability of oxygen in the water and the rate at which the filter can process waste. Aquarists have developed a number of rules of thumb to allow them to estimate the number of fishes that can be kept in a given aquarium; the examples below are for small freshwater fish as larger freshwater fish and most marine fishes need much more generous allowances.

* 3 cm of fish length per 4 liters of water (i.e., a 6 cm-long fish would need about 8 liters of water).
* 1 cm of fish length per 30 square centimeters of surface area.
* 1 inch of fish length per gallon of water.
* 1 inch of fish length per 12 square inches of surface area.

Experienced aquarists warn against applying these rules too strictly because they do not consider other important issues such as growth rate, activity level, social behavior, and so on. To some degree, establishing the maximum loading capacity of an aquarium depends upon slowly adding fish and monitoring water quality over time, essentially a trial and error approach.

====Factors affecting capacity====

Though many conventional methods of calculating the capacity of aquarium is based on volume and pure length of fish, there are other variables. One variable is differences between fish. Smaller fish consume more oxygen per gram of body weight than larger fish. Labyrinth fish, having the capability to breathe atmospheric oxygen, are noted for not needing as much surface area (however, some of these fish are territorial, and may not appreciate crowding). Barbs also require more surface area than tetras of comparable size.

Oxygen exchange at the surface is an important constraint, and thus the surface area of the aquarium. Some aquarists go so far as to say that a deeper aquarium with more volume holds no more fish than a shallower aquarium of the same surface area. The capacity can be improved by surface movement and water circulation such as through aeration, which not only improves oxygen exchange, but also the decomposition of waste materials.

The presence of waste materials presents itself as a variable as well. Decomposition is an oxygen-consuming process, therefore the more decaying matter there is, the less oxygen as well. Oxygen dissolves less readily in warmer water; this is a double-edged sword as warmer temperatures make more active fish, which in turn consume even more oxygen. Stress due to temperature changes is especially obvious in coldwater aquaria where the temperature may swing from low temperatures to high temperatures on hotter days.

==6. Fill an aquarium containing at least five gallons of water with a balance of plants and fishes, either tropical or native, and maintain the same for at least six months.==
This can be done by the individual Pathfinder at home, or as a group in a classroom or the regular Pathfinder meeting place.  If keeping fish as a group, be sure that everyone gets to participate in all aspects of their care.  The likelihood of success will be maximized by being sure to follow the guidelines set out in requirement five.

==7. Note the effect of the following on the fishes and aquarium in general:== 
===a. Too much light===
During the time that aquarium plants are exposed to light, carbon dioxide is absorbed and oxygen is expelled. The gases enter the plant mainly through the leaves. The carbon dioxide and water are chemically combined with the chlorophyll in the plant to produce simple sugars. The sugars are converted to starch and oxygen is produced as the by-product. The light in your tank is most important with respect to the chlorophyll. The chlorophyll is what absorbs the light to create the process of photosynthesis. The aquarium plant naturally absorbs more nutrients through the roots during this time.

===b. Too little light===
Respiration is the opposite of photosynthesis. When the lights are out, the photosynthesis process ceases but the respiration continues. The aquarium plant will use oxygen to break down food substances, which is released as energy in the form of heat. Carbon dioxide is produced and expelled as a result of this process.
So, when the lights are on the plants absorb carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. When the lights are out the aquarium plants absorb oxygen and expel carbon dioxide.

===c. Overfeeding===
Overfeeding is one of the major causes of fish loss. Overfeeding promotes fish waste (ammonia) to build up to a harmful level. It is best to feed your betta only enough food that it can eat in five minutes. If food is seen sitting on the bottom of the aquarium or bowl, the fish have been overfed.

===d. Excessive change in water temperature===


Rapid changes in water temperatures stress your fish. when fish are stressed they are more susceptible to disease and sickness.

===e. Too few plants and too many fishes===


Fish need plants in the wild for shelter, food, filtration, and oxygen. In an aquarium you supply their main source of food

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Preliminaries==

===&lt;u&gt;How does a typical C Program look like?&lt;/u&gt;===

First, a very simple example of a C program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* Sample C program that outputs the word &quot;Hello&quot; */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
     printf(&quot;Hello\n&quot;);
     return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The program shown in the example above is what is referred to as a &lt;u&gt;'''program source code'''&lt;/u&gt;. The source code is made up of a combination of letters, numbers and other symbols. The source code can be created by the programmer/user using any text editor.

In the class, we will write C programs using the following format:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
      /* ...your variable declarations... */

      /* ...your statements... */

      return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===&lt;u&gt;What is a statement?&lt;/u&gt;===

All C programs are made up of a sequence of instructions. In C, instructions are also called &lt;u&gt;'''statements'''&lt;/u&gt;. In the English language, a statement is terminated by a period, a question mark or an exclamation point. Note that &lt;u&gt;'''in C language, a statement is terminated by a semicolon'''.&lt;/u&gt; In the example program above, there is only one statement -- the &lt;tt&gt;printf()&lt;/tt&gt; statement.

===&lt;u&gt;What is a function?&lt;/u&gt;===

All statements should be written inside a user-defined &lt;u&gt;'''function'''&lt;/u&gt;. You may think of a function as a group or sequence of statements. It is analogous to the English language wherein a paragraph is made up of a sequence of statements. The word &quot;user-defined&quot; means that it is the user who defined (or wrote) the description of a function. In the example program above, there is only one user-defined function -- the &lt;tt&gt;main()&lt;/tt&gt; function. &lt;u&gt;'''All C programs must have a &lt;tt&gt;main()&lt;/tt&gt; function.'''&lt;/u&gt;


===&lt;u&gt;What is the use of { } symbols?&lt;u&gt;===

The symbol { is referred to as &lt;u&gt;'''open brace'''&lt;/u&gt; or &lt;u&gt;'''open curly bracket'''&lt;/u&gt;. Likewise, the symbol } is called &lt;u&gt;'''close brace'''&lt;/u&gt; or &lt;u&gt;'''close curly bracket'''&lt;/u&gt;. The curly brackets are used for grouping purposes. Think of an open curly bracket as something synonymous to begin and the close curly bracket as the symbol for end. Thus, in the example program above, the open and close curly brackets designate the beginning and the end of the &lt;tt&gt;main()&lt;/tt&gt; function, respectively. Note that the curly brackets must always come in pair. A missing curly bracket is one of the most common cause of syntax errors.

As we shall see later on, the curly brackets are used to group several statements. 


===&lt;u&gt;What is the use of /* */ symbols?&lt;/u&gt;===

The symbols /* and */ are used to group comments inside the program. Comments are not instructions, rather they simply provide additional information (a textual description) such as what the program is doing, what are the inputs, what are the outputs, etc. Think of /* as the beginning of a comment, and the */ as the end of a comment. Just like the curly brackets, these symbols always come in pair. comments are optional and maybe placed anywhere within the program source code. 

It is possible to write several lines of comments inside the /* */. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* The following is 
   an example 
   of a very simple C program */
void main()
{
     printf(&quot;Hello\n&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;


Note that comments cannot be nested, meaning you cannot put /* */ inside /* */. For example, the following is erroneous:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/*
   this is a comment

   /* this is one more comment - which will cause an error */

*/
&lt;/source&gt;


===&lt;u&gt;What about the other symbols?&lt;/u&gt;===

The meaning of the other symbols, i.e., &lt;tt&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;void&lt;/tt&gt; will be explained later.

==Naming Conventions==

===&lt;u&gt;What is a name? What are the naming conventions in C?&lt;/u&gt;===

Data and instructions to manipulate data are referred to by their names. In C, there are rules and conventions to follow in giving a name to something; these are as follows:

1. Names are made up of letters and digits.
 
2. The first character &lt;u&gt;'''MUST'''&lt;/u&gt; be a letter.

3. C is case-sensitive, meaning the lower-case letter 'a' is &lt;u&gt;'''NOT'''&lt;/u&gt; the same as the uppercase letter 'A'.

4. The underscore symbol _ is considered as a letter in C. It is not recommended to be used, however, as the first character in a name. 

5. At least the first 31 characters of a name are significant.

Examples:

The following are examples of valid names:

&lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;void&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;hello&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;salary&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;rate_per_hour&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;student_1&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;student_2&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;student_3&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;First_Name&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;ComputeGrade&lt;/tt&gt;


The following are examples of invalid names:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

1                 /* must start with a character */

1_ab              /* must start with a character */

a&amp;                /* &amp; symbol cannot be used in a name */

xyz_%             /* % symbol cannot be used in a name */

$money            /* must start with a character,

                     $ cannot be used in a name */
&lt;/source&gt;




===&lt;u&gt;What is a keyword?&lt;/u&gt;===

As a language, C has its own vocabulary -- a set of &lt;u&gt;'''keywords'''&lt;/u&gt;. These names are reserved and cannot be used for other purposes such as in naming user-defined variable names. In the example program, the name &lt;tt&gt;void&lt;/tt&gt; is a keyword. 

The ANSI C language has 32 keywords (ONLY!).

Note that the name &lt;tt&gt;printf&lt;/tt&gt; is actually &lt;u&gt;'''not a C keyword'''&lt;/u&gt; and not really part of the C language. It is a standard input/output library pre-defined name. These distinctions will be explained later.

==Constants, Variables, Data Types, Declarations==

===&lt;u&gt;What is a constant?&lt;/u&gt;===

A constant is an entity whose value does not change. A constant can either be a numeric constant or a literal constant.

Example:

Example of numeric constants:

&lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;500&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;-10000.100&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;3.1416&lt;/tt&gt;

Example of literal constants:

&lt;tt&gt;'A'&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;&quot;Hello&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;&quot;The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;


Note: In C, a literal constant with only one character is referred to simply as a &lt;u&gt;'''character'''&lt;/u&gt;. It is written such that it is enclosed in a pair of single quotes. If there is more than one character, it is called a &lt;u&gt;'''string'''&lt;/u&gt;. A string is written enclosed in a pair of double quotes.


===&lt;u&gt;What is a variable?&lt;/u&gt;===

A program is made of data and instructions to manipulate those data. Note that data have to be stored somewhere, and thus will need some memory space in the RAM. 

A &lt;u&gt;'''variable'''&lt;/u&gt; is an entity that is used to store data. Without variables, there is no way (or actually NO PLACE) to store data. A variable has

* a name (more specifically a symbolic name)

* an associated physical memory space (portion in a RAM)

* a data type

* a value (depends on data type)

* a scope

* a lifetime

The concept of scope and lifetime will be discussed in the latter part of the course.


===&lt;u&gt;What is a data type?&lt;/u&gt;===

A data type specifies

* the kind of values that can be assumed by a variable of that type

* The range of values that can be assumed by a variable of that type

* the amount of memory (in bytes) needed by a variable to store a value of that type


===&lt;u&gt;What (basic) data types are available in C language?&lt;/u&gt;===

There are four basic data types, namely:

* &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; - the character data type. The &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; data type is used to represent/store/manipulate character data values. A &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; data type value requires one byte of memory space. The range of values that can be assumed by a &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; value is from 0 to 255. The number-to-character coding that is used is ASCII. 

* &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; - the integer data type. The &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; data type is used to represent/store/manipulate signed whole numeric values. 

* &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; - the single precision floating point data type. The &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; data type is used to store single precision signed real numbers(i.e., those numbers with decimal values).

* &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; - the double precision floating point data type. The &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; data type is used to store double precision signed real numbers(i.e., bigger numbers with decimal values).


The amount of memory space required to store an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, a &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;u&gt;'''platform-dependent'''&lt;/u&gt; (depends on the machine and the software). For 32-bit machines (and 32-bit compilers such as Microsoft C compiler), an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; requires 4 bytes of memory each, while a &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; requires 8 bytes of memory. 

Note that a &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; data is actually numeric (0 to 255), and is treated as a subset of &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; values. Any operation (discussed later) on integer values can also be performed on characters. 


''Assignment:''

Find out what is the range of values (minimum and maximum values) for the following data types: &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; on your platform. Hint: Try to look for two files named &lt;tt&gt;&quot;limits.h&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&quot;float.h&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; that comes together with your C compiler. 


===&lt;u&gt;How can you determine the actual size of each data type?&lt;/u&gt;===

The following program can be used to print the sizes of the basic data types:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
     printf(&quot;Size of char: %d\n&quot;, sizeof(char));
     printf(&quot;Size of int: %d\n&quot;, sizeof(int));
     printf(&quot;Size of float: %d\n&quot;, sizeof(float));
     printf(&quot;Size of double: %d\n&quot;, sizeof(double));

     return 0;
     getch();

}
&lt;/source&gt;


The &lt;tt&gt;sizeof&lt;/tt&gt; is a keyword in C. It is an operator that yields the size in number of bytes of the specified data type shown above.

===&lt;u&gt;What is variable declaration?&lt;/u&gt;===

A variable declaration is an &quot;action&quot; by which a variable is &quot;introduced&quot; to a program/function. All variables in a C program must be declared. If you forgot to do so, the compiler will report a syntax error. 


===&lt;u&gt;How do you declare a variable?&lt;/u&gt;===

In C, the syntax for declaring a variable is as follows:

&lt;tt&gt;&lt;data type&gt; &lt;variable name&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

 
The symbol &lt;tt&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; means that it is required to specify the item enclosed within a pair of angled brackets. A semicolon signifies the end of a declaration. A missing semicolon will cause the compiler to generate a syntax error. Variables should be named following the C naming conventions. 

Example:

&lt;tt&gt;char ch;&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;int i;&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;float f;&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;double d;&lt;/tt&gt;


It is possible to declare several variables of the same type on the same line. In such a case, a comma should be inserted between two variables. A missing comma will generate a syntax error. 

Example:

&lt;tt&gt;char ch1, ch2;&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;int x, y, z;&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;float hourly_rate, number_of_hours, salary;&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;double numerator, denominator;&lt;/tt&gt;


===&lt;U&gt;Can I use any name for the variables?&lt;u&gt;===

Yes, as long as you follow the naming conventions, and do not use the C reserved words. 

It is recommended, however, as a good programming practice for you to use a name that is descriptive or suggestive. For example, if you know that a variable will represent the hourly rate of a part-time worker, then don't use names such as &lt;tt&gt;xyz&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt; x1&lt;/tt&gt;. It is better to use a variable name such as &lt;tt&gt;rate&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;hourly_rate&lt;/tt&gt;. Note that the use of the underscore makes the variable name easy to read.

===&lt;u&gt;What is the value of the variable initially?&lt;/u&gt;===

By default, the value of a variable in C is GARBAGE, meaning there is something stored in that memory space but that something is invalid for the intended use. 

A variable must be properly initialized. By initialize, we mean assigning a valid value to a variable. The use of a variable with a garbage value will cause a logical error -- another type of error that is very difficult to find. 

Exercises:

1. Declare middle initial as a character variable

2. Declare age as an integer variable

3. Declare deposit amount, withdrawal amount as floating point variables

4. Declare length, width, height as double data type variables

=A History of This Text=
== What is a Wiki Book? ==

Wikipedia was first created as a free ongoing encyclopedia project. The idea about a collaborative encyclopedia came about to allow many different people to add information to a certain page. Wikipedia, what many consider to be the main Wiki on the web today, was founded in 2001 by volunteers and today is known as one of the largest reference sites on the web. Like many other wiki’s on the web today, visitors do not need certain qualifications to contribute information to a wiki page. The problems with this aspect of wiki books is that even though many accomplished, knowledgeable people add information to wiki’s, wiki’s could essentially be formed without any credibility.

== Creation of this Text ==
This Wikibook was created during the summer of 2008 to encourage students to create a supplemental text for the course Technical and Professional Writing offered at the University of Minnesota. This online text is suppose to serve as a substitution for having a textbook, but the overall hope is to develop the text until it is a publishing level and can be used by future students of 3562W. The Technical and Professional Writing Wikibook will help to produce a new insight into using effective communication practices by written completely by students. The Wikibook 3562W will help you to understand how to write professional. This Wikibook starts off with basic business writing techniques that will help you develop a resume, learn to write proper memos, create business documents, draft proposals, etc. The goal of the text is that tools will learn and gain from the Wikibook will help readers become not only proficient and successful writers, but also successful individuals.

== Main Focus of this Text ==
Professional and Technical Writing emphasizes teaching students to grasp a difference between the educational, practical, and business purposes one may have when writing.
* Educational- Will be read by teachers
* Practical- Will be read by co-workers, customers, and other individuals
* Business- Will be read by employers, clients, and different organizations
Technical and Professional Writing tries to prepare students for their future careers by teaching them the basic business writing strategies and techniques.



=== Philosophy ===
Student creation of a text reflects a student-centered educational philosophy. 

{a student needs to conduct interviews, and add background information}

== Classes Contributing ==
In reverse chronological order (most recent to first), these are the classes making major contributions to this text.
*ENGL3025A Technical Writing, Robert Morris University, Moon Township, PA, Spring 2012
*Writ 3562 Technical and Professional Writing, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Spring 2010

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to my page!

Currently, I am working on some educational projects, but right now I am focusing my attention in making Programming modules. This is the module I am currently developing:


[[Fundamentals of C Programming]]


Although it is not yet finished, I'll strive to finish this as soon as possible, so that you may all read and learn the basics of C.

I'm still continuing to develop some more projects, and I hope my contributions will be a big help to you, certified Wikibookian!


This is all for now, and enjoy learning here at WikiBooks!</text>

It is all very well building and executing &quot;mathematical&quot; or &quot;formal&quot; models.
But one must also connect with the &quot;society&quot;.
In particular one must connect with [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computers_%26_Society &quot;computers &amp; Society&quot;].
The introduction of the NoWasteNoWant garbage firm is meant to 
give a handle on that connection.

== Puck container==
I imagined that there might be a Wikipedia article on the puck container.
There isn't.
I have found an excellent resource though on the 
[http://smb.slac.stanford.edu/robosync/Universal_Puck/ universal puck]
I will use that straight-away. (Михал Орела 11:36, 14 August 2008 (UTC))</text>

A good starting point to see what is out there (i.e., outside the &quot;Wiki&quot; world)
is to look at the courses offered by the Colleges.
So. We begin by searching on the title.

== Open sources on the net==
In harmony with the freedom of the Wikibook
only open, freely available resources are '''listed''' in this Wikibook.
For example, it seems that [http://www.enotes.com/computers-society-article eNotes]  is an excellent resource. But it is not free.
